We were disgusted to hear that CBS dropped "The Van Dyke Show" and "Annie 
McGuire." First, they put them opposite stiff competition, then dumped them 
because of low ratings. We had to tape them for viewing at a later date since 
they were opposite our favorite shows. Why schedule shows in time slots where 
they are bound to fail?

OUTTAKES: LOBOTOMIZED 'BRAZIL'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember back in 1985, when director Terry Gilliam battled MCA-Universal prez 
Sid Sheinberg over the final cut of Gilliam's Orwellian comedy, "Brazil" . . . 
and won? Well, maybe he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Universal released Gilliam's 131-minute version to numerous raves and a best 
picture award from the L.A. Film Critics Assn., albeit to lackluster box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, a 93-minute version of "Brazil" aired on KTLA Channel 5 as part 
of a Universal syndicated TV package -- it airs again tonight at 8 -- promoting 
it with raves actually written about the original. 
</P>
<P>
But scenes have been recut and rescored, using new takes and dialogue dubbed by 
sound-alike actors. The story -- about a clerk who escapes a repressive society 
through fantasy, but is finally lobotomized -- was changed and simplified, with 
a new, happy ending assembled from unused footage. Elaborate dream sequences 
now total 47 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Who's responsible? 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg hadn't returned calls by press time. But the new "Brazil" closely 
follows the "radical rethink" devised three years ago by Sheinberg, as 
described since by two film editors hired to make the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, reached in London and apprised of the altered state of his movie, told 
us: "It's wonderful, because it gives Sid a chance to break into TV. The only 
sad thing is, the world doesn't get to appreciate that Sid made this film." 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Gilliam said, Universal asked for his "input" on the latest 
edit (he declined) -- and that the studio wouldn't let him remove his name. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he added, "They're selling it as 'Brazil,' the film that won best picture, 
and that's nonsense." Steven Smith

Sources tell us that Kevin Costner will make his directorial debut in March 
when Island Pics shoots "Dances With Wolves" in Mexico. The 19th-Century 
romantic adventure, adapted by Michael Blake from his novel, centers on the 
relationship between a white man and an Indian woman in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Reps for Costner and Island wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
A source said that Costner, who's been searching for a project to direct for 
about a year, zeroed in on "Wolves" partly because it could be made 
economically. He'll have the only major English-speaking role, with the other 
principal parts written in Indian and Spanish dialects. 
</P>
<P>
Also signing up for his first directing job is "Moonstruck" writer John Patrick 
Shanley. The project is "Joe vs. the Volcano" at Warner Bros., a comic fantasy 
with Tom Hanks as a man who sells his soul to the devil. Scheduled to shoot 
next summer. Leonard Klady

Pixie Tracey Ullman gets star billing in Tri-Star's "I Love You to Death," the 
true, if unlikely story of a New Jersey housewife who plots her philandering 
husband's murder but, instead, falls in love with him again. The black comedy 
(a one-time Anne Bancroft vehicle to be directed by her hubby Mel Brooks) is 
being written/directed by Lawrence Kasden in April with Kevin Kline set to play 
the errant spouse. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bacon stars in Trans World's "Johnny Destiny Turns on the Radio," a love 
story with film noir and weirdly comic twists to film in Las Vegas in April. 
Lawrence Turman directs the Turman/Foster production based on an original 
screenplay by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Missing in acting for three years, Jon Voight goes before the cameras shortly 
in Avatar Prods.' "Eternity," a romantic epic spanning several centuries. 
Voight co-wrote the story with Steven Paul and Stuart Paul, the former Paul 
also producing/directing. Eileen Davidson stars as the woman whom Voight must 
convince that he's loved before in another time. Armand Assante plays a shadowy 
figure who has thwarted their bliss throughout time. . . . Leonard

Batfans take note: The first trailer of the still-filming $35-million-plus 
"Batman" -- with Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader -- is now showing. 
</P>
<P>
A Warner Bros. PR exec said that 350-500 trailers have been sent to "premiere 
houses" and "everyone seems to love them." 
</P>
<P>
But reactions from the Bat-critics we polled were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
One Batcritic said that as Bruce Wayne, Keaton looks like, well, Keaton -- "a 
nebbish." But the shots of him in his Batcostume were heralded as "awesome!" 
</P>
<P>
But is it Keaton or the costume that's awesome? The way it's made, even a 
97-pound weakling would look Schwarzeneggian. 
</P>
<P>
What's more (or less), you can't even tell it's Keaton in the costume -- until 
a shot in which Our Hero, while effortlessly lifting a bad guy, squeakily 
proclaims, "I'm Batman." 
</P>
<P>
A Warners rep stressed that the trailer was made up of raw daily footage, and 
that Keaton will later re-do his lines. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that may not need reworking is the Batmobile: One Batfan proclaimed: 
"It's absolutely incredible! Every kid will have to have one next Christmas."

Lifton cannot expect his theory to have widespread approval because there are 
too many people still alive who are working to keep the truth buried. History 
will prove Lifton to be right. That will be his reward for seeking and finding

Regarding "True to the West" (by Grover Lewis, Nov. 20): As another "must see" 
to be added to the many that abound in greater Southern California, the Gene 
Autry Western Heritage Museum will certainly be one to explore. Indeed a great

Lee Green's story about David Lifton's work ("His J.F.K. Obsession," Nov. 20) 
was a real page-turner. Green pointed out that Lifton's book, "Best Evidence," 
was given a negative review by Times' critic Kenneth John Atchity, who felt 
that getting to the truth of the matter won't resurrect J.F.K. I say, the point 
is not to resurrect J.F.K.; that cannot be done. However, we should not let 
whoever assassinated him get away with murder.

FIXED IN THE MIX: Talk about patting yourself on the back. The 12-inch version 
of Ziggy Marley's hit, "Tumblin' Down," is loaded with a hefty chunk of 
sampling (excerpts of previously recorded songs) from the 1982 Tom Tom Club 
hit, "Genius of Love." And guess who produced Marley's album? Tom Tom Club duo 
(and Talking Heads members) Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. But wait -- it 
turns out that the duo didn't plug their old hit in "Tumblin'." In fact, 
according to Tom Tom Club manager Gary Kurfirst, Frantz and Weymouth had "no 
idea" their old song was on the 12-inch single. 
</P>
<P>
"All that sampling stuff wasn't on the original version of 'Tumblin' which 
Chris and Tina produced," said Kurfirst. "Apparently when Virgin (Marley's 
label) remixed the 12-inch, someone added the sampling. No one even asked for 
our approval." 
</P>
<P>
Since Frantz and Weymouth receive royalties as the record's producers -- and 
are slated to handle Marley's next album -- they're happy to see the record on 
the charts. Kurfirst added: "We just don't want anyone to think that Chris and 
Tina took advantage of their producer's role to push their hit on Ziggy's 
record."

POP EYE: THE WORST OF '88. . . FROM THE BOTTOM UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had enough of Top Ten lists? 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. . . . it's time for Pop Eye's ninth annual Bottom 10, a collection of 
1988's biggest critical flops. We've polled 40 writers, deejays, record execs, 
managers, musicians and rank 'n' file music fans for their picks for this 
coveted Dean's List of Decrepit Discs. 
</P>
<P>
The year's biggest stink bomb? By a wide margin, the winner was ex-Led Zeppelin 
guitarist Jimmy Page's much-maligned solo album, "Outrider." As one voter 
complained: "It sounded like the kind of bad Zep imitation you'd hear from a 
Holiday Inn lounge act." It's Page's second swing through the Bottom 10 -- he 
made 1985's all-worst list as a member of the Firm. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year for big-star belly flops. Page was joined on the Bottom 10 by 
David Lee Roth (who one voter blasted as "almost as tacky as Geraldo Rivera"), 
Huey Lewis &amp; the News and aging veterans Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
This year's voters also nailed Zep-imitators Kingdom Come, boorish headbangers 
Poison, all-gal metal group Vixen ("What a concept -- Lita Ford quintuplets") 
and shock-comic Sam Kinison, who cracked the Bottom 5 thanks to widespread 
outrage over his "Wild Thing" video (which one voter claimed "is so sexist, it 
makes Motley Crue's clips look like Snow White cartoons"). 
</P>
<P>
There were no other repeat offenders from past years, though the Bottom 10 had 
its first sound-track entry -- "More Dirty Dancing" -- since the 1984 poll, 
which featured "Metropolis." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, voters suggested all sorts of oddity choices, including Glenn Frey 
("Worst haircut in rock 'n roll"), Robert Palmer ("I hope he drowns in 
Pomade!") the "Cocktail" sound track (for spotlighting the Beach Boys' drippy 
"Kokomo" single) and Duran Duran ("Their videos do to women what the Brazilians 
are doing to tropical rain forests"). 
</P>
<P>
Narrowly missing the final cut, but getting enough votes to merit honorable 
mention were albums by: Rick Astley, George Michael, Glenn Frey, Taylor Dayne, 
White Lion, Hall &amp; Oates, Bon Jovi, Robert Palmer, the Fat Boys, Robert 
Plant, Kenny Loggins, Olivia Newton-John, Breathe, Duran Duran, Boz Scaggs and 
Steve Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Winners: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Outrider," Jimmy Page. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Skyscraper," David Lee Roth. 
</P>
<P>
3. "Out of This World," Europe. 
</P>
<P>
4. "More Dirty Dancing," sound track by various artists. 
</P>
<P>
5. "Have You Seen Me Lately?" Sam Kinison. 
</P>
<P>
6. "American Dream," Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
7. "Kingdom Come," Kingdom Come. 
</P>
<P>
8. "Small World," Huey Lewis &amp; the News. 
</P>
<P>
9. "Vixen," Vixen. 
</P>
<P>
10. (Tie) "Open Up and Say . . . Aaahh," Poison. 
</P>
<P>
10. (Tie) "Britney Fox," Britney Fox.

RATTLES AND HUMS: Motley Crue is apparently still at work on its upcoming 
album, "Too Hot to Handle." In addition to the title track, the band has loads 
of originals like "Dollar in My Pocket," "Poisonous Dreams" and "Dead Man" -- 
plus a raucous cover of "California Girls". . . . Iron Maiden is taking a year 
off from recording while singer Bruce Dickenson finishes a novel about a 
transvestite. . . . Talk about a real Richard Thompson fan: John Mellencamp 
drummer Kenny Aronoff called to get tickets to a recent Thompson show in 
Bloomington, Ind., only to find that the concert had been canceled after 
Thompson's drummer slipped in the shower and broke his arm. Aronoff offered to 
fill in and not only played that night, but also finished out the tour with 
Thompson.

ART NEWS: PUTTING PHOTOGRAPHY'S HISTORY INTO FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Today we take for granted the things a camera can do, whether it be a 
photograph of Mars or a human fetus. But 150 years ago, each new use found for 
the newborn medium meant an exciting leap forward in its evolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Formative Decades: Photography in Great Britain, 1839-1920" at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, is an exhibit designed to highlight early 
innovation in British photography. With 130 images, it documents an important 
period of growth dating from photography's birth. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhibit is about the different uses of photography in England during the 
Victorian period and a few years beyond," said museum photography curator 
Kathleen Gauss. "It's really about the way photography offered the chance to 
see the world in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
"The images on view are not necessarily so beautiful, but they are interesting 
because of the innovation or experimentation with something that is so much 
integrated into our lives today but was so radical back then." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the innovation meant a print development process that made the job 
easier, Gauss said. "It was very much a period of exploration of how to get 
that image produced. People experimented with different ways to make negatives 
and prints." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it meant a boon for science. 
</P>
<P>
"Astronomy was able to benefit," said the curator, noting the stereograph of a 
full moon, circa 1859, in the show. Other scientific subject matter includes a 
shot of the inside of a hen's egg and a picture of a plant with a long Latin 
name taken through a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
Portraiture was transformed during the era too, Gauss said, from "its original, 
stiff and formal presentation, to a much more fluid atmospheric style." 
</P>
<P>
A graceful, near full-length portrait of May Prinsep by Julia Margaret Cameron, 
circa 1870, exemplifies this change. Staring out serenely with a secure, fixed 
gaze, Prinsep's billowy dress and the fluid curve of her inclining torso recall 
pre-Raphaelite paintings, Gauss said. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in photography brought the world a little closer as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those enterprising Brits took their cameras to Russia, Tahiti or India and 
photographed the native people in their own lands," Gauss said. "These kinds of 
photographs made the world accessible, they made possible the grand tour that 
you or I could not afford." 
</P>
<P>
"The Formative Decades," through March 19, was organized by the Archer M. 
Huntington Art Gallery of the University of Texas at Austin in cooperation with 
the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center. It is one of several upcoming 
exhibits and programs planned at the County Museum of Art on the occasion of 
the 150th anniversary of photography. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

LENNON LIVES

<TEXT>
<P>
If your year-end wrap up of major record label activity, Patrick Goldstein and 
Paul Grein referred to the sound track to "John Lennon: Imagine" as a "stiff" 
(Pop Eye, Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, the album has done quite well (recently placing 2 in Tower 
Records chainwide CD chart) and has just passed the mark for gold record status 
well after the film has faded away.

SECRETARYISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am somewhat surprised that none of the glowing reviews of "Working Girl" 
bothered to consider the clearly discriminatory bias of this otherwise 
innocuous film. 
</P>
<P>
In the film the position of secretary is depicted as one worthy only of 
derision and shame, whose only legitimate goal is to be promoted out of it. 
With the sole exception of the title role, secretaries are portrayed as overly 
cosmeticized bimbos concerned with their hair, nails and coffee breaks rather 
than the affairs of the business that employ them. 
</P>
<P>
Tess' best friend, apparently typifying the attitudes of these self-loathing 
women, is appalled at the presumption of a secretary trying to rise above her 
station. 
</P>
<P>
This portrayal is a reprehensible insult to the professional secretary. This is 
an important and valuable business position with its own set of standards, 
opportunities and contributions to an overall enterprise. Done incorrectly, it 
can undermine an otherwise productive and well-run business. Done well, it is 
an invaluable enhancement to a business accompanied by a sense of teamwork and 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, the position of secretary is deserving of profound respect and not 
the derision heaped upon it by this movie.

MAKING TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calendar's generally excellent cover story on "Taste Makers," one matter 
puzzled me. In Bill Steigerwald's article on Spy magazine editor E. Graydon 
Carter piece, he cites Spy magazine's influence on the realms of humor and 
satire. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the truth is that for millions of people across the country (especially 
those like myself, usually defined as yuppies), there is only one definitive 
humor magazine on the market, the one that has been out there the longest and 
remained the funniest: National Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
More than just wildly inventive and deliciously irreverent (it was a favorite 
when I went to college and it seems to be more popular than ever today), 
National Lampoon has been a trend-setter and taste-maker in the American 
culture for some 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is the magazine that launched the careers of people like John 
Hughes, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Jeff Greenfield, P. J. O'Rourke 
and Gilbert Gottfried, among others. Many (myself proudly included) consider 
all other humor publications merely pale imitations. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there are other quality humor magazines available, but none which 
has made as strong of an impact on the way we look and laugh at ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
If all that doesn't make them "taste-makers" of the highest caliber, I really 
don't know what does.

VERTICAL GARDENING BY CAROLINE BOISSET (WEIDENFELD &amp; NICOLSON; 1988) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Linda French 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GARDEN DESIGN focuses primarily on planting the grounds around the home. But 
here is a book with a different viewpoint -- working with the vertical planes 
of the garden. A blank wall can serve as the canvas for a climbing garden full 
of color and texture year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"Vertical Gardening" is of interest not only to those with limited space but 
also to those with larger gardens who wish to divide them into smaller, more 
intimate spaces with planted fences or trellises. Sections include ideas for 
window boxes, "edible" walls, walls of scent, hanging gardens and water 
features. 
</P>
<P>
The book's one drawback: As with most garden books, this one is written for 
much colder climates, and many of the plants suggested for use are not suitable 
to Southern California. But with a little extracurricular research to find 
similar plants, the same principles of design can be applied. ($24.95) Linda

PAPIER-MACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DON'T LET THE French name fool you; papier-mache was invented in the Orient, 
probably by the Chinese; Persians and Japanese later used it for masks and 
other ceremonial objects. But in Europe during the 17th Century, papier-mache 
became not only a household word, but also household objects -- even furniture. 
The craft became a large industry in England, but in America it survived in the 
home, practiced by women who made boxes, lamps and other useful pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Papier-mache shapes are made by mixing paper pulp (usually made from newsprint 
and water) with glue or paste into a workable consistency; the goo is then 
arranged into a three-dimensional shape, applied to a surface, placed over a 
skeletal framework (called an armature) or shaped in a mold before final 
painting or decorating. The finished piece is sealed with varnish or wax -- not 
just to make it spiffy but also to keep water and humidity from turning it back 
into pulp. 
</P>
<P>
The technique is simple enough for children, but it is also flexible enough for 
artists, many of whom continue to explore this craft in folk and fine art. In 
Mexico, papier-mache is a respected medium for everything from museum-caliber 
sculpture to pinatas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most art schools do not offer classes in papier-mache, but a few colleges and 
university extensions do: Santa Monica College Community Services recently 
offered a class in papier-mache mask making and promises to have more in the 
spring quarter. In lieu of classes, check the library and local bookstores for 
how-to books.

THE BOOK OF FRESH FLOWERS BY MALCOLM HILLIER (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER; 1988)

THE LOGICAL SUCCESSOR to "The Book of Dried Flowers," which Hillier co-wrote 
with Colin Hilton, "Fresh Flowers" is illustrated with stunning photos of 
flower arrangements the like of which we hardly ever see at the neighborhood 
florist. But what makes this book several cuts above the usual pretty 
coffee-table entry are the pages of photos and descriptions of individual 
flowers. Because this is a British book, some of the flowers will be 
unavailable -- or outrageously expensive -- in Southern California. Of course, 
one can always attempt to grow one's own. ($29.95) Judith Sims

WRONGFUL DISMISSAL CASES WILL STILL HAVE THEIR DAYS IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
RECENT RULING ASIDE, WORKERS CAN WIN AT TRIAL IF THEY'VE BEEN FIRED UNFAIRLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM S. WALDO, WILLIAM S. WALDO, a management attorney specializing in 
employment issues, is a partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Paul, Hastings, 
Janofsky &amp; Walker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many pundits declared that employers won a big victory last month when the 
California Supreme Court limited the damages that workers in most circumstances 
can claim in wrongful dismissal cases. Don't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
True, the court ruled that someone who is fired without good cause in violation 
of a company promise cannot sue for emotional distress or punitive damages -- 
the ways by which some California employees have won jury verdicts of $10 
million and more. That, in turn, will mean that there is less big money for 
lawyers to make in wrongful dismissal suits and thus less incentive to pursue 
weak cases. 
</P>
<P>
But don't count wrongful dismissal cases out in California -- they will clog 
the court system and give employers headaches for a long time to come. For 
everyone involved -- employers, employees and lawyers alike -- the impact of 
the ruling probably will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the curbing of emotional distress and punitive damages drastically 
reduces the number of multimillion-dollar jury verdicts, these remain 
big-dollar cases. Damage awards for out-of-pocket losses -- the kind of losses 
that plaintiffs still can sue for under any circumstances -- run into the 
hundreds of thousands, and at times millions, of dollars. That's because these 
cases often involve well-paid executives who sue to recover salaries, bonuses, 
stock options, pensions and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
What if lower-paid workers want to sue? Their rights are well protected. Fired 
employees have long contended that they should be able to recover all of their 
out-of-pocket losses from the date of their discharge until the date they would 
have retired -- normally age 65. On that basis, a terminated employee in his or 
her mid-40s earning $25,000 per year could ask the jury for a damages award 
exceeding $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the stakes in wrongful discharge lawsuits will stay high enough to 
motivate discharged employees to bring them -- even in cases when emotional 
distress and punitive damages aren't available. And those with good cases 
should have no problem getting capable lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of an employee winning a case remain high. Previous studies have 
suggested that employees in California win up to 80% of wrongful discharge 
trials. The major reason: Juries tend to identify with the discharged employee 
because nearly everyone works for a living or depends on someone who does. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors look at the employee and think "there but for the grace of God go I." 
The state Supreme Court's ruling, in the case of Los Angeles executive Daniel 
D. Foley against Interactive Data Corp., did nothing to change this. 
</P>
<P>
Another bit of encouragement for plaintiffs and their lawyers comes right from 
the Supreme Court's ruling itself. For the first time, the court stated that 
many California employees have the right to sue their employers for wrongful 
discharge for violating an oral or implied contract calling for someone to be 
terminated only for "good cause" or "just cause." Before, this right was 
assumed by plaintiffs' lawyers but was by no means beyond challenge. 
</P>
<P>
All this means that employers should be as careful as ever in terminating 
employees. Not only is the risk of losing a significant verdict high, but an 
employer's cost of defending these lawsuits is virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Wrongful discharge lawsuits are, by their nature, hard to develop. Everyone has 
his or her own version of the truth. Each lawsuit can require an employer to 
spend hundreds of thousands in attorneys' fees and even more in the lost 
productive work time of supervisors and managers who have to help the lawyers 
and take the time to testify in depositions and at trial. The cost of a legal 
defense alone should make any employer who is tempted to fire an employee 
capriciously think twice about it. 
</P>
<P>
We need only look to the track record of other states to know that wrongful 
discharge will not only survive but thrive. Before the Foley decision, only one 
state -- Montana -- ever permitted the recovery of emotional distress and 
punitive damages in wrongful discharge lawsuits outside of cases involving 
breaches of public policy. The absence of emotional distress and punitive 
damages in other states has never stopped these suits; thousands of new ones 
are filed each year. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps what is most overlooked in the aftermath of the Foley case is that 
emotional distress and punitive damages will continue to be available in many 
lawsuits where employees sue their employers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the issue hasn't been definitively resolved in California, some courts 
have held that such damages are in order for fired workers who are 
discriminated against on the basis of, among other things, age, gender and 
race. And in the Foley decision itself, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that 
employees who are discharged in violation of a "substantial public policy" (for 
example, someone who is fired for blowing the whistle on an employer that sells 
adulterated food or engages in illegal price fixing) can win emotional distress 
and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, in many wrongful discharge lawsuits, the wrongful termination 
itself is not the only issue. For example, what about the employee who is not 
only fired but who is also lied to by the employer about the reasons for the 
firing? Or consider the case of a manager who misrepresents why an employee was 
fired when someone calls for a reference check. Employees who are the victims 
of flagrant employer misconduct will try to sue not only for wrongful discharge 
but also for fraud, defamation or even intentional or negligent infliction of 
emotional distress. If the courts permit this, it means plaintiffs still can 
win emotional distress and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the practical impact of the Foley decision on the California 
workplace should be slim. As Mark Twain might have put it, predictions about 
the demise of wrongful discharge are greatly exaggerated.

Archimedes said that if he had "a lever long enough and a prop strong enough," 
he could move the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, some ingenious financiers have found that lever (the modern word is 
leverage) in the form of junk bonds, and they certainly have created giant 
movement in the commercial world. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes that these operators will avoid the element of greed and work toward 
improving our national economy.

mentally retarded, autistic and abused children served by our programs. 
</P>
<P>
We are especially impressed that Milken not only gives generously of his 
dollars but that he gives generously of himself. Through his frequent visits to 
our programs, we experience firsthand an individual filled with compassion, 
commitment and caring. The children call him "Mike," their soft-spoken, 
unpretentious and very caring friend. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill said that we make a life by what we give. Milken's life is 
one that is filled with giving in many ways. His largess profoundly influences 
the creation of brighter todays and tomorrows for countless children in order 
that they may achieve their fullest potential. His support of numerous programs 
of education, prevention, health care, medical research and community services 
in this country is important and praiseworthy.

SPENDING CUT NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nov. 6 column by James Flanigan, "Promises of No New Taxes Have a Hollow 
Ring," has a hollow ring of its own because it ignored an alternative to tax 
increases that likewise was ignored by this year's crop of candidates. Namely, 
reducing waste, mismanagement and inefficiency in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
If the new Congress and President work together to implement all of the 
recommendations of the Grace Commission, fully three-quarters of the federal 
budget deficit could be eliminated without cutting essential programs and 
without any tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
The American people are already are taxed enough. Tax increases will serve only 
to undermine economic growth by taking additional resources away from where 
they are needed most: the private sector. Besides, as recent history has shown 
us, Congress spends $1.55 for each additional dollar that it receives in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, tax revenues have gone up dramatically since President Reagan assumed 
office, thanks to economic growth. The problem, of course, is that spending has 
gone up even faster. 
</P>
<P>
So if the health of the economy is what we are really concerned about, then 
let's end all this talk about the "need" or "inevitability" of tax increases. 
What we need is to reduce the deficit by reducing spending. Nothing less will 
do.

ERMA BOMBECK: FUN IN THE KITCHEN IS OUT OF DAD'S RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I fantasized about coming home from the Women's Revolution, I always 
visualized Tara. I saw my husband anxiously pacing the veranda, and when he saw 
me coming down the long, dusty road, tired and numb, he ran to meet me halfway. 
Then he lifted me off my feet and said, "Come in and rest. I have a roast in 
the oven with new potatoes, baby carrots, a Caesar salad and a surprise for 
dessert." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow I never visualized him sitting in front of the TV set yelling, "How 
long is dinner going to be?" 
</P>
<P>
I am not alone. Ninety percent of married women who work outside the home do 
most of the cooking. The majority of them get a meal to the table in less than 
30 minutes. Nearly 80% do not eat out because of the exorbitant prices. 
</P>
<P>
Men live by the old adage, "If God had wanted men to cook, he would never have 
invented women." 
</P>
<P>
The male mindset about cooking intrigues me. Some men will go to the store. 
Some men will set the table. Some men will make coffee in the morning. A few 
will set a cereal box on the table. Beyond that, most men will not cross over 
the line. They have no curiosity about how to turn on the stove. They have 
never seen a naked chicken. They see no adventure in tearing along a dotted 
line. 
</P>
<P>
My theory is that it's not so much a macho thing as it is fear. I think to them 
a kitchen is the Temple of Doom. All those whirling blades, open fires, 
arsenals of knives, boiling pots and dinging bells make 'em crazy. They're flat 
out intimidated by them in action. So they act like they're above them. They'll 
fix a disposal, but they won't feed one. They'll unstick ice cube trays from 
the freezer, but they won't fill them with water. They'll sharpen knives, but 
they won't use them. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, put them in the back yard in a cute little apron and a 
chef's hat and they're Betty Crocker. 
</P>
<P>
As I have often told my husband, "I'm replaceable, you know. Anyone who can 
read can get a meal to the table. There's nothing to it. Cooking isn't a 
talent. It's an exercise." Yet whenever I come in late, there he is, sunk into 
a chair in front of the TV set waiting for the proverbial "dinnnahhh." If I 
didn't come home for two years, there is no doubt in my mind he would sit there 
until he would decompose and neighbors would eventually call the police to haul 
his starved bones away. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to be able to report the next generation of men is being converted to 
"kitchen," but this doesn't seem to be the case. Both of my sons consider 
chicken Kiev a Russian wimp and Hungarian peppers two rock sisters on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
One kid who eats every meal out said to me recently, "I just paid $2.50 for a 
hot dog. How could you and Dad afford to feed me three or four at one meal?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't give you a paper napkin," I said.

SHORT TAKES: A PEACE WALK, 100 HOURS OF FOOTAGE AND A PRIZE FILM 
</P>

<P>
Peace marches have gotten to be a habit with film producer Cathy Zheutlin of 
Santa Monica. Zheutlin's film, "Just One Step: The Great Peace March," began a 
three-weekend premiere showing here Saturday, one day after she returned from 
the Soviet Union and her wedding -- to Russian cameraman Edis Yurchis whom she 
met on the Soviet-American Peace Walk in the summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Zheutlin, who received permission to film the 1986 trek across America only 10 
days before it was scheduled to leave Los Angeles, shot the march for 300 days, 
ending up with more than 100 hours of footage to edit when she returned home. 
She got a personal loan to buy a used motor home for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zheutlin and her film crew received initial funds from Guenette 
Productions to begin the walk, she raised additional money to continue it 
through mailings, fund-raisers and donations in towns and cities along the 
route. In the daytime, she served as film director and a camera operator; at 
night, as producer and production manager. To cut production costs, Zheutlin 
trained several marchers to work as sound recordists and production assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"The march is really about people acting according to their beliefs," Zheutlin 
said of her film. "And documenting their remarkable journey gave me a chance to 
live and work according to my own personal values." Zheutlin's mother, Jonnie, 
was one of the marchers on the 3,700-mile walk. 
</P>
<P>
"Just One Step" received the first prize for social issues films at the 
Anthropos Film Festival, co-sponsored by the American Film Institute and the 
Discovery Channel and was given a Cine Golden Eagle Award and a Bronze Apple 
Award. It will be shown at 10:15 a.m. today, and on Saturday and next Sunday, 
and Jan. 21-22 at the Laemmle Monica Fourplex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica. LYNN

SHORT TAKES: A KNIGHT OF THE ROAD HAS KIND WORDS FOR TRUCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time -- not too long ago either -- when a private motorist could 
count on a truck driver to give appropriate road signals, lend assistance, 
offer directions. The truckers were indeed "Knights of the Road" -- a breed 
apart; tough, to be sure, but dependable. 
</P>
<P>
Don Clark remembers the mystique. It's what got him into trucking in the first 
place, straight out of high school. Bright, articulate, fiercely independent, 
Clark, 40, of Long Beach, was tapped a couple of years ago by his trucking 
company for a management position. He gave it a shot, did well, but after two 
years, Clark couldn't wait to get on the road again: "I enjoy the open road. I 
like to break a sweat once in a while. I'm a truck driver." 
</P>
<P>
That he is. This year, Clark is one of eight -- selected from among 5 million 
drivers -- named to lead the 1989 "America's Road Team" as national spokesmen 
for the trucking industry. One of the team's tasks, Clark says, is to weed out 
the "fringe element -- a comparative handful of less qualified, less desirable 
drivers" who've filtered into the ranks as a side effect of 1980's 
trucking-deregulation law. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "I'd never discourage any young man from driving a truck," Clark says. 
"In a way, it's the modern version of a cowboy. You're your own boss, 
responsible for your own actions. Sure, it's hard sometimes. You still have to 
hook up and break up your own sets (rigs that connect trailers), which means 
pushing around 3,000 pounds, sometimes in the snow in remote locations where 
nobody's around to give you a hand. But what other job pays you to see the 
whole U.S.?" 
</P>
<P>
As for the persistent belief that the best road food can be found at a truck 
stop, Clark advises that it's "probably no longer true. As a rule, though, when 
you see a bunch of trucks, it means the place has good coffee and friendly 
waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
"And remember: Never eat at a place called 'Mom's.' " DICK RORABACK

ANDERSONVILLE, GA., MUSEUM HONORS THE NATION'S POWS

I am dying, comrades dying 
</P>
<P>
Far away from friends and home 
</P>
<P>
In this rebel den I'm lying 
</P>
<P>
suffering, staring, all alone 
</P>
<P>
 -- From poem written by an unknown Andersonville prisoner 
</P>
<P>
All that is left of the infamous Confederate prison in this small, central 
Georgia town are graves. In the 3-foot-deep trenches are the remains of 12,912 
Union soldiers and sailors, buried side by side, shoulder to shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Usable clothing was removed to be worn by surviving prisoners or guards. Then 
dirt was shoveled on top of their partially clad or naked bodies. 
</P>
<P>
For the living, Andersonville was a place of horror. Prisoners lived in 
squalor, their excrement everywhere. Many went insane. Many killed fellow 
prisoners for a few morsels of food. Still others committed suicide, died from 
scurvy, gangrene, dysentery and other diseases caused by poor sanitation, 
malnutrition, contaminated water, overcrowding, exposure to the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Largest of the Confederate military prisons, Andersonville existed for 14 
months -- from February, 1864, to the end of the war in May, 1865. More than 
45,000 Union troops were held here. 
</P>
<P>
All prison buildings were torn down after the Civil War. The grounds are now 
occupied by the Andersonville National Cemetery, National Historic Site and 
National Prisoner of War Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only POW Museum 
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1987, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the 
American Ex-Prisoners of War, has operated the National Prisoner of War Museum, 
the only one of its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate that here at Andersonville, where so much suffering occurred 
to Union prisoners, we honor and commemorate the sacrifices of all American 
POWs throughout history," said Helen Smith, 62, historian since 1972 of the 
30,000-member American Ex-Prisoners of War. 
</P>
<P>
She is the wife of Allen Smith, 66, a retired Diana, Tex., millwright and World 
War II Army Air Corps sergeant who was captured in the Philippines and held 
prisoner by the Japanese for 42 months. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Smith worked with John Tucker, 40, superintendent of the Andersonville 
National Historic Site, to establish the POW museum, housed temporarily in a 
62-year-old storage building on the cemetery grounds. Early this year, the 
organization will launch a $2.5-million fund drive to help finance construction 
of a larger permanent POW museum in Andersonville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letters and Diaries 
</P>
<P>
The temporary museum is filled with memorabilia from POWs of World Wars I and 
II, Korea and Vietnam. "We have space in the present museum to display only 
about 10% of our archival resources," Smith said. "The museum's purpose is to 
tell the POW story to the American people through interpretive exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
On display are letters from POWs, prison camp diaries and artwork, exhibits 
explaining psychological warfare, photographs of emaciated POWs upon their 
release from the camps and maps showing their locations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WWII Prison Camps 
</P>
<P>
Another exhibit describes the 666 U.S. prison camps that housed 400,000 
Germans, 50,000 Italians and 5,000 Japanese during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
POWs from throughout the nation come to Andersonville to meet with museum 
visitors and explain their lives as prisoners of war. Often they are 
accompanied by their wives, who detail their own nightmares -- not knowing 
whether their husbands were dead or alive, sometimes for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Monument 
</P>
<P>
William J. Thompson's haunting sculpture of a crippled POW leaning on a crutch 
stands in front of hundreds of marble headstones marking the burial place of 
Andersonville prisoners. Presented by Georgia in 1976, the statue honors all 
American prisoners involved in all of the nation's wars, and carries the words 
of Zechariah: "Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey erected a monument here in 1899 in memory of its residents who died 
in the Confederate camp. 
</P>
<P>
The graves were cared for then by the Grand Army of the Republic's Woman's 
Relief Corps auxiliary. From 1910 to 1970 the GAR served as caretaker of the 
graves. Since then the National Park Service has had the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, 20 states whose soldiers died here erected 
monuments in their honor. The monument for Iowa is particularly poignant, a 
weeping woman with the inscription: "Iowa honors the turf that wraps their 
clay. Death before dishonor." The names of all Iowans buried here are on the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept Records of Dead 
</P>
<P>
At war's end Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, came here with a 
detachment of laborers and soldiers, and former prisoner Dorence Atwater to 
properly identify all the graves. 
</P>
<P>
While a prisoner, it was Atwater's duty to keep records of the Union dead. When 
a man died, a wooden stake bearing a number was hammered into the ground over 
his remains. Atwater kept the list of names corresponding to the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he and Barton directed the placement of wooden markers bearing the names 
and state of each of the dead. In the 1870s and 1880s marble headstones 
replaced the wooden ones. Barton also directed the successful campaign to 
convert the Andersonville Prison graveyard to a National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Perched atop the marble headstone of Lewis S. Tuttle, a young soldier from 
Saco, Me., is a marble carving of a dove. No one knows how it got there, when 
or why. It's the only headstone different from all the others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Person Charged 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Henry Wirz, the commandant of Andersonville Prison, was the only Civil 
War veteran charged with war crimes, was found guilty and then hanged on Nov. 
10, 1865. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with "conspiring to impair and injure the health and destroy the lives 
of federal prisoners in violation of the laws of war," Wirz was described as a 
monster and a fiend by Northerners. Southerners claimed he was a scapegoat, a 
good soldier, a hero and martyr. 
</P>
<P>
The Daughters of the Confederacy erected a large monument to Wirz on 
Andersonville's main street "to rescue his name from the stigma attached to it 
by embittered prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Wirz's daughter and granddaughter unveiled the monument on Nov. 10, 1909, the 
44th anniversary of his hanging. An annual memorial service is conducted there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honored Posthumously 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 Wirz was posthumously awarded the Confederate Medal of Honor at a 
convention of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Dallas. Wirz Street in 
Andersonville is named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
"Feelings continue to run deep to this day about Capt. Wirz, about 
Andersonville Prison, about the Civil War," said Mayor Lewis F. Easterlin, 79, 
grandson of William Easterlin, a Confederate drummer boy at Andersonville 
Prison. "It's good to research history and research it right, good to remember 
history and remember it right."

'TRADITION' AND THE WORKING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that whenever a researcher points out that some women have postponed 
paychecks in order to be full-time mothers and homemakers, The Times sees a 
need to devote considerable ink to attack the research. As a child of the '70s, 
it has been my impression that the women's movement is about freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
As hard as it is for View to believe, there are a fair number of women who work 
only the minimum necessary to maintain professional skills, to put food on the 
table, or who do not work at all because they have children. Former Rep. 
Geraldine Ferraro is an example of a woman who postponed her career to devote 
time to her young family. Her decision to be a mother first and a lawyer later 
does not appear to have a detrimental effect on her "self-actualization," to 
use Eve Mayer's phrase. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the critics of Good Housekeeping's new ad campaign seem to have noticed 
that the magazine has made a simple marketing decision to target and serve a 
particular group of women. Women who see themselves served by the magazine will 
buy it; women who don't will go on reading New Woman, Savvy or the Wharton 
Review.

Good Housekeeping's new ads are a refreshing change. Those of us who have made 
an educated decision to devote our minds and skills to the nurturing of our 
families tire of being told by the media that homemakers are robbed of identity 
and are not free or self-actualized.

Equal to the subtle-yet-unmistakable slam against women in the Good 
Housekeeping ad is the slam against the international community. Not only is 
the center of the world one's own home, but those English-speaking and 
(probably) all-white Girl Scouts are more important than the UNICEF cards (and, 
I presume, the attendant issues of health care, hunger and shelter for those in 
need). If this is neo-traditional, then I'm for the Revolution.

<P>
For the last two decades, women have been striving to earn their due 
recognition as individuals -- equal partners with men in the home and 
workplace. While this change has created anxiety in many women and threatened 
many men, the net result has given all of us greater options in how we choose 
to live our lives. 
</P>
<P>
I am discouraged by the recent trend in politics and advertising that professes 
a return to the "traditional values." As a single parent, I value the unique 
strength a family can provide, regardless of the form it takes.

<P>
Each family must be created by individuals willing to give equally in a manner 
that best suits its circumstance. The "life style" professed by the Good 
Housekeeping ad campaign dictates a stereotype that can only create unnecessary 
anxiety and frustration for women, and men, too. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and children must create their own roles in the changing family and not 
give in to the simplistic wishes of the advertising industry. Change can be 
positive when viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat.

Britain's preeminent guide, Fred Pearson, is taking to the skies in '89 with 
his newly established HelicopTours, providing sightseers with the opportunity 
to eavesdrop on castles, palaces, manor houses and the rural beauty of England. 
On London flyovers, Pearson's on-board guides point out the city's landmarks: 
Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, Piccadilly Circus, London Bridge, the 
Tower of London, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Operating daily, Pearson's fleet of helicopters will propel visitors beyond 
London to Stonehenge, West Wycombe Park (landscaped by the legendary Capability 
Brown), Leeds Castle (former home of William the Conqueror), Canterbury 
Cathedral, the white cliffs of Dover, Woodhenge, Silbury Hill, Palladian Bridge 
at Wilton House, the thatched cottages of the Cotswolds, Blenheim Palace, 
medieval Oxford, Eton, Hampton Court and other attractions. Choppers land while 
passengers take pictures, dine at unusual restaurants. Plan your own itinerary 
or join one of three tours. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pearson's land tours by private car provide pickup and delivery to 
your hotel. Offbeat tours (including a visit to Sherlock Holmes' private study) 
are on Pearson's list, along with an opportunity to dine at Britain's oldest 
inn (circa 1155). Pearson's Take-A-Guide does private tours throughout England, 
Scotland, Wales and the Continent. Specially planned trips for the handicapped. 
Others for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, Pearson was cited for his leadership in tourism by the London 
Tourist Board. His Take-A-Guide will arrange meetings with members of 
Parliament, send visitors off on fox and grouse hunts. Pearson insists he's 
prepared to arrange anything short of tea with Queen Elizabeth II. TAG's 
celebrity clientele includes James Michener, Robert Redford, Bob Hope, Irving 
Wallace, crown princes and princesses and dozens of other prominent figures. 
Humorist Art Buchwald described Take-A-Guide as "a unique organization that 
operates on the theory that tourists hate to be herded around in large groups." 
</P>
<P>
Pearson preaches that travel should be "glamorous, fascinating and rewarding." 
His customized tours include Royal London, Legal London, Breakfast in London, 
London at Night, Doctors' London, Classical London, Shopping in London, Heart 
of England, plus others. 
</P>
<P>
For helicopter/land tour rates, contact Take-A-Guide, 11 Uxbridge St., London 
W8, England, or Take-A-Guide in the United States at 65 E. 79th St., New York 
10021. The toll-free number: (800) 223-6450.

Another Small Hotel 
</P>
<P>
We failed to include the Beaufort today among our small hotels featured on page 
1. Comprises two early Victorian houses. Only a squeak from Harrods department 
store. During summer, an umbrella of plane trees rises over this remarkable 
little hotel. No reception desk, no bartender. Just sign in, pour yourself a 
drink and sign the honor tab. A total of 29 rooms (each decorated differently). 
More than 200 English water colors. Pop-up maps of London. Free memberships in 
a London health club. Loads of books. The hotel will arrange car hires, tours, 
restaurant bookings. It's near Hyde Park (great for joggers). The Beaufort will 
store your suitcases and other belongings for your next visit. Charming. 
Expensive. Rates: 90 single, 105/130 double. We give the Beaufort five stars: 
*****. 
</P>
<P>
The Beaufort, 33 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3 1PP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Another 
</P>
<P>
It's not elegant. But it gets good marks for its reasonable prices: The 
Fielding Hotel, 4 Broad Court, London WC2 (just off Drury Lane). Rates: 38 
single plus 15% VAT; doubles with showers, 48 plus 15% VAT. The Fielding is 
opposite the Royal Opera House in the area of Covent Garden. One of the best of 
central London's cheaper hotels. Dates from the 18th Century. Two stars: **. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dining in London 
</P>
<P>
Alastair Little serves marvelous meals in an atmosphere of mediocrity. In the 
words of The Times of London: "Paper napkins and food are unceremoniously 
dumped on your table." The floor is scuffed. The tables are chipped. But the 
menus are rated high (this is one of Fred Pearson's favorite restaurants). 
Menus change regularly. Here's a sampling of the offerings: chicken wrapped in 
bacon, calves liver with sweet onions and a wine sauce, toasted scallops, fine 
meat dishes. Pearson swears by this nondescript little restaurant that makes a 
Denny's look like Chasen's by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Alastair Little, 49 Frith St., London W1. Open Monday through Friday. No credit 
cards.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: A GRAY WHALE OF A TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM, The Grimms are free-lance writers/photographers 
living in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 18,000 or more gray whales are making their annual swim from 
Alaska to the lagoons of Baja California as Southlanders migrate to local ports 
for whale-watch excursions. 
</P>
<P>
The watchers may not spot those two TV-star gray whales that were temporarily 
trapped in the frozen Bering Sea late last year, but there's a good chance 
they'll see other likable leviathans. 
</P>
<P>
Some nature lovers opt for long voyages around the Baja peninsula into the Sea 
of Cortez in the hope of encountering more whales -- humpback, fin, Bryde's, 
orca and the enormous blue. Whale-watchers also will explore the islands and 
mainland of rugged Baja, which has been called the Galapagos of North America. 
</P>
<P>
Boats will depart through April from 10 ports between Santa Barbara and San 
Diego in search of gray whales. Most are sportfishing vessels that carry from 
80 to 145 passengers. Largest are Catalina Cruises' triple-decked ferries that 
can carry 525 whale watchers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Narrations Given 
</P>
<P>
Excursions average 2 to 3 1/2 hours, but trips to the Channel or Coronado 
islands last longer. Since whale traffic is difficult to predict, the boat 
operator decides if a "whale check" for another trip will be given to 
passengers if a whale isn't sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Naturalists or volunteer guides from the Cabrillo Marine Museum or American 
Cetacean Society narrate on some vessels about the whales and other marine 
life. In most cases, however, it is the boat captain who gives the commentary. 
</P>
<P>
For close-up views when the whales spout, fluke and breach, use binoculars and 
a telephoto lens for your camera. Also dress warmly. Pack a few refreshments if 
your boat doesn't have a galley that sells snacks and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Departure times vary, but usually there are more frequent excursions on 
weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for whale watching average $9 to $11 for adults, $6 to $8 for children. 
Sometimes fares are less on weekdays and for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Call listed numbers for specific ticket costs and departure times, reservations 
and directions to the dock. 
</P>

(619) 234-8687. 
</P>
<P>
Baja Lagoons: For closer encounters with California gray whales, longer trips 
depart from San Diego to San Ignacio and Scammons lagoons along Baja's Pacific 
coast. That's where the whales end their migration to mate and give birth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limit People Contact 
</P>
<P>
These once-endangered creatures seem to relax at the completion of their 
5,000-mile swim. A number of them have been dubbed "friendlies" because they 
come alongside skiffs that are lowered from the excursion vessels. Passengers 
can reach out and pet the barnacle-encrusted mothers and their newborn 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the whales from excessive human contact in the lagoons that are 
their age-old breeding and calving grounds, the Mexican government limits the 
number of boats that can enter. Currently, seven U.S. vessels have permission 
to visit San Ignacio and Scammons lagoons, and those sportfishing boats are 
based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At H&amp;M Landing are the Spirit of Adventure and Champ, while the Royal Star, 
Royal Polaris, Searcher, Qualifier and Pacific Queen operate from Fisherman's 
Landing. From now into April, they make seven- to 11-day excursions that also 
visit wilderness islands along Baja's Pacific side. 
</P>
<P>
On Todos Santos, San Martin, San Benito and Cedros islands, you'll see a rich 
array of animal, bird and plant life, including elephant seals, magnificent 
frigatebirds and desert wildflowers. The boat or tour staff includes 
naturalists who identify the flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
These natural-history expeditions to the gray whale lagoons are organized by 
boat operators and tour agencies or groups that charter the vessels. Departure 
dates and tour prices vary considerably; cost from San Diego averages $140 per 
person per day, meals included. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
To help you find a berth on board, boat operators and charter groups with space 
still available for this season's trips are listed below. Call them for tour 
details, availability and reservations.

<P>
H&amp;M Landing, 2803 Emerson St., San Diego 92106, (619) 222-1144, operates 
two vessels as agent for Pacific Sea Fari Tours. Many trips are led by whale 
expert Theodore J. Walker.

<P>
Besides its own trips, the Pacific Queen has charter dates for the San Diego 
Natural History Museum. Contact Margie Stinson, (619) 726-2228, for bookings. 
</P>
<P>
If you would rather not sail to the whale lagoons, overland trips to San 
Ignacio are run by Baja's Frontier Tours based in San Diego, (619) 232-1600. 
It's owned by Karen and Piet Van de Mark, who have been escorting visitors 
around the peninsula since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Sea of Cortez: Other whale excursions go to the eastern side of Baja through 
the Gulf of California, which most tour brochures call the Sea of Cortez. Those 
boat trips are scheduled into early April, and many of them begin or end in La 
Paz. 
</P>
<P>
Especially luxurious are cruises on the Polaris, the 80-passenger vessel of 
Special Expeditions of New York City, (212) 765-7740 or toll-free (800) 
762-0003. Passengers are pampered and go ashore with naturalists in rubber 
landing craft to explore uninhabited islands and remote sections of the 
peninsula accessible from the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Special Expeditions' most extensive trips circumnavigate Baja in order to view 
several species of whales. Those 15-day nature cruises are also the most 
expensive, starting at $3,950, with air fare from Los Angeles. Eleven-day 
sojourns begin at $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sea of Cortez nature tours can be made aboard the 20-passenger Don Jose 
and the Baja Explorador. The trips are organized by Baja Expeditions of San 
Diego, (619) 581-3311 or toll-free (800) 843-6967. 
</P>
<P>
That company also sails with the Don Jose to see gray whales in Magdalena Bay 
on the Pacific side of the peninsula. A similar trip is offered by Biological 
Journeys, (707) 839-0178. 
</P>
<P>
Biological Journeys also charters the Don Jose and Baja Explorador for whale 
excursions in the Sea of Cortez. Two other trips in that gulf aboard the Don 
Jose are chartered by the American Cetacean Society, (213) 548-6279. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Sea Fari Tours runs a Sea of Cortez trip on the Spirit of Adventure 
from H&amp;M Landing, (619) 222-1144, and that vessel is chartered for similar 
excursions by Oceanic Society Expeditions, (415) 441-1106. Oceanic Society 
Expeditions also has a Sea of Cortez trip aboard the Qualifier.

TRAVELER'S DIARY: A MOVABLE FEAST MOVES FROM PARIS AREA TO PAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HORACE SUTTON, Sutton is a New York City syndicated travel columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EUGENIE-LES-BAINS, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early '70s, a diminutive and somewhat rotund chef named Michel Guerard 
won three Michelin stars for his tiny restaurant on a back-of-the-lot fringe of 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
It was called Pot au Feu, and serious and famous eaters flocked there until 
Paris, in its infinite wisdom, decided a new roadway was needed. Alas, it was 
placed right in the path of Guerard's tiny temple. The fire went out at Pot au 
Feu, but it burned even brighter in Guerard's belly. 
</P>
<P>
Michel and his wife Christine picked up the pieces and moved to the vicinity of 
Pau, southeast of Bordeaux and east of Biarritz, where royalty used to play, a 
whistle away from the Spanish border. 
</P>
<P>
Christine's family had property in the middle of a wide area of thermal springs 
first developed by Henri IV. She and Michel settled in the town called 
Eugenie-les-Bains, so named because Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, came 
here to bathe in the natural hot springs. 
</P>
<P>
Together they built a small but elegant hotel that shelters 35 guests (eight 
more rooms are being built). Each room was given a name that would summon a 
dream -- buttercup, citronella, rosewood, clouds. Some faced the magnolias, 
palms, bamboo, tulips, water lilies, orange trees and banana trees. Others 
faced the pool set in a meadow sprinkled with peonies and iris. 
</P>
<P>
There are tennis courts for the hyperactive, petanque for those who want to 
roll a ball down an alleyway, and billiards for inclement days. There isn't a 
room deodorant spray can in sight; bundles of fresh rosemary hang in the room 
closets, tied with white ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
While the spa was developed, Michel created Cuisine Minceur, a cuisine of 
slimness, and even wrote a book about it. He confessed that he had been a chef 
gourmand who liked his robust food. But Christine, who would soon marry him, 
whispered in his ear: "You know, Michel, if you would lose some weight you 
would look great." 
</P>
<P>
Those few words created a whole new enterprise. And from Michel's new kitchen 
in the South of France there came a whole new way to eat elegantly while 
sidestepping calories. A sample menu might include lobster salad with mangoes, 
roast pigeon with spicy mincemeat, crepes filled with apples and a lemony 
apricot mousse. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a chef of his talents couldn't avoid producing, at the same time, a 
carte gourmande -- golden pates, a "pillow" of mushrooms and truffles in cream, 
fat disks of foie gras from Landes (some say the best in France), oven-roasted 
salmon perfumed with truffle oil, pastry fritters stuffed with crayfish and an 
artichoke salad swimming in olive oil, plus pig's feet and mashed potatoes with 
truffles, rabbit and chopped bits of goose with sweetbreads. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one could end the horn of plenty with iced fruit and sherbet 
spilling out or go the whole cochon (hog) with the dessert du roi, the dessert 
of the king -- all in chocolate, including a hot souffle, chocolate ices and a 
pot de creme. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those who eat at the Cuisine Minceur and are laved by the waters, 
Michel and Christine suggest having one last meal chosen from the gourmand 
menu. You will have earned it after you've tubbed in hot spa water, been 
sprayed with a hose and taken an underwater massage where a masseuse works over 
your belly. 
</P>
<P>
For some (though not for me), a white mud bath is sheer weightless heaven; 
weightless because you seem to float in white goo. And after radio evaporation, 
a tingling high-pressure needle shower and a swallow or two of diuretic water, 
there is, for ladies anyway, the beauty parlor. 
</P>
<P>
During the stay, whether in the spa or not, one is encouraged to drink mint and 
chamomile tea and to inhale the verbena, sweet basil, chives and sage that 
perfume the air. You can walk a boulevard lined with rosemary to the fussy 
little church that stands at the crossroads at the very entranceway to Michel 
and Christine's corner of heaven. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Les Pres d'Eugenie would have satisfied most kitchen creators, 
but not Michel. He spent seven months at wine school and bought the Chateau 
Bachen estate a few miles from Eugenie-les-Bains. Here he is growing four kinds 
of grapes that he will begin to market this year under the label of the Baron 
de Bachen. They will be bottled in elongated flasks that resemble tall bottles 
of Bordeaux, a region which is, after all, a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
It is a white wine fruity with suspicions of cumin and thyme to tease the 
palate. In the middle of the wine field sits the Baron's old 17th-Century 
chateau, which Michel and Christine have redone in splendid style, with a big 
kitchen range that Christine designed (and sells to other restaurants and large 
houses), and even an octagonal porcelain hot tub. This is where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Besides all that, the Guerards are about to produce an armagnac, a cousin of 
cognac being distilled at another chateau 45 minutes away. What else? Well, 
Michel has given up Bloomingdale's, where he maintained a fine food station for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
He still creates frozen foods in France, Switzerland and Belgium, an outgrowth 
of his work with Stouffer's, which produces Lean Cuisine -- an idea he 
developed with Stouffer's parent company, Nestle. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the vineyard, below the grand building where the grapes will 
be pressed, barreled, aged and bottled, a tiered amphitheater is taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
Summer musical festivals will be held there. Michel Guerard -- wine maker, 
armagnac distiller, creator of Cuisine Minceur and Cuisine Gourmande -- might 
very well do a turn on stage himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I may sing," he says. He surely has plenty to sing about.

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: SHANGHAI TRAFFIC EASES; CAMERAS AT TAJ MAHAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY, Habegger and O'Reilly are free-lance 
writers living in Northern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report to help you make judgments about travel. 
Because conditions can change overnight, always make your own inquiries before 
you leave home. In the United States, contact the nearest passport agency 
office; abroad, check in with the nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- China: Shanghai has big plans to ease its congestion, including a 105-mile 
subway system and tunnels under the Huangpu River. The first nine miles of the 
subway will be completed by 1992, with the rest of the system scheduled for 
completion by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
All pets dogs in Shanghai have been ordered killed because of an outbreak of 
rabies. Pet dogs are outlawed in most Chinese cities, but Shanghai has 500 
legally registered dogs, as well as thousands of illegal ones. Owners have been 
ordered to kill them or have them confiscated by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Begging is on the increase in China's major cities. In some places, beggars can 
make in a day what an ordinary worker earns in a month. According to some 
estimates, it's quietly becoming a profession, especially in Hunan Province. 
</P>
<P>
 -- India: While cameras are allowed, photographs can no longer be taken from 
the terrace level of the Taj Mahal, a new regulation that serves no discernible 
purpose and keeps monitors busy blowing their whistles. People take photographs 
anyway, and the constant sound of the whistles is an intrusion that interferes 
with the enjoyment of one of the world's greatest treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Many regions in India require special permits for travel, and some can be 
difficult or impossible to obtain, notably permission for non-Indians wishing 
to go to the Punjab. Check your itinerary with Indian authorities before you 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pakistan: Peshawar, near the Khyber Pass leading into Afghanistan, has long 
been an open market for arms and other merchandise of war, but of late it has 
become a marketplace for an odd assortment of luxury goods imported from 
Europe, Japan, the United States, even the Soviet Union. Bara Bazaar, 10 miles 
west of the city, displays Soviet refrigerators and air conditioners alongside 
French perfumes and American cosmetics, all contraband goods in great demand 
among upper-class Pakistanis. The bazaar is testament to the ingenuity of 
Afghan traders and the power of the free market. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
 -- Angola/Namibia: The recent signing of a peace treaty between Angola, Cuba 
and South Africa paves the way for regional peace and independence for Namibia, 
formerly ruled by South Africa. The agreement could likely open up travel and 
tourism to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burkina Faso: This country is now free of cholera and yellow fever. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mozambique: South Africa has signaled an end to its support of Renamo 
guerrillas fighting a war of terror against the government and populace, and 
plans to replace it with economic cooperation. Without South African aid, the 
guerrilla group will probably disappear, because it has little support within 
the country and no other source of arms or income. The move raises hopes for 
the future of this beautiful but desperate land ravaged by more than a decade 
of internal conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika and glasnost are changing the face of the Soviet Union, but if you 
want to find your way around Moscow, the only comprehensive street guide 
available remains the one produced by the CIA. Russian maps of the city are 
deliberately inaccurate, designed to confound rather than guide. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean 
</P>
<P>
 -- Haiti: Haitian leader Gen. Prosper Avril recently suggested the formation 
of an electoral council to organize a presidential election two years from now, 
a sign that a return to democracy there is a long way off. The potential for 
unrest remains high. Defer non-essential travel. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico 
</P>
<P>
Mexico City's air pollution, among the worst in the world, has reached such 
levels that schools will reopen a month later than usual after the Christmas 
break because officials fear for the children's health. January and February 
are the worst months for pollution there because of thermal inversions. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burma: The Burmese government is making attempts to draw foreign 
investment, recently implementing laws to allow repatriation of profits and tax 
exemptions for the first time in 26 years. But the prospects for foreign 
investment are not good until political stability is achieved. The U.S. State 
Department still advises Americans to defer travel there. A sign that the 
country is newly conscious of its image is a recent decree that residents of 
Rangoon, the capital city, paint or whitewash the exteriors of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Indonesia: The government recently announced that foreigners will soon be 
allowed into East Timor, a region that has been off-limits since Indonesia 
invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Singapore: Another bit of Singapore's old charm will vanish in April when 
Change Alley falls victim to the wrecking ball. A 100-yard lane near the famed 
Raffles Hotel, Change Alley has been drawing traders for more than 50 years. It 
got its name from its original traders, money-changers who dealt in every 
conceivable currency, and later became a market offering all manner of 
merchandise from trinkets to electronic goods. One of the last remaining places 
in Singapore where people can still haggle for goods, Change Alley will be 
razed as part of an urban renewal plan.

Filling a needed niche in guidebooks, Penguin has a new series directed at the 
experienced traveler. These are not pocket guides offering facts without 
mention of atmosphere, but instead are designed to eliminate the cumbersome 
lists of virtually every existing hotel and restaurant. Detailed information 
has been compiled from interviews with 35 savvy world travel writers. The 
series includes "Italy" ($14.95), "France" ($14.95), "Canada" ($14.95), 
"England and Wales" ($12.95), "Australia" ($11.95) and "Ireland" ($10.95). 
Special out-of-the-way places are detailed. The books capture the personality 
and excitement of each destination.

"Hawaii for Free," by Francis Carter, tells how you can improve on a vacation 
to this island paradise. It lists hundreds of fun and fascinating things to do 
and see throughout the islands. Among them are touring the wineries or 
breweries for a taste of the local product, and watching Japanese folk dancing. 
</P>
<P>
For a lip-smacking experience, you can sample the goodies at the Kailun Candy 
Co. The guide demonstrates that there's more to the islands than a lei and a 
luau. Available at most bookstores or send $6.95 (plus $1.50 handling) to 
Mustang Publishing, P.O. Box 9327, New Haven, Conn. 06533.

The well-informed independent business traveler heading for South America can 
enjoy a more fascinating journey across a tapestry of distinct cultures with 
"The South American Handbook -- 1989." It's a complete source book of more than 
a million words. 
</P>
<P>
This excellent reference gazeteer offers information about such topics as local 
laws, transportation, languages, currency and medical facilities, and includes 
bits on the history, people, geography, cities and economics. The capital is 
the first place covered in each country's section, which is further divided 
into subsections with corresponding maps and listings of excursions, sights, 
routes and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The information on festivals, holidays and where to stay and eat is above 
average. As a bonus, the guide supplies comparative information for the 
Caribbean, Mexico and Central America. It's so complete that it even describes 
a home-style remedy for curing Montezuma's revenge (Prentice Hall: $29.95). 
</P>

<P>
You may read about events happening in the country of Gabon, or the city of 
Surabaya, but just exactly where are they? "The New York Times Family Atlas of 
the World" furnishes the answers with a great supply of maps. All place names 
are in English, and indexed in alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics include geographical comparisons of the longest rivers, biggest 
cities, highest mountains and largest lakes, oceans and seas. The maps help 
define the Earth's climate, and pinpoint earthquake areas. The colors, symbols 
and codes offer rapid access to data. The illustrations, simulating views from 
outer space, offer a broader understanding of world travel and communication 
challenges (Salem House: $24.95).

HER WORLD: PICKING UP THE PIECES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I looked down, aghast at what I had done to my dinner plate at the cozy Gasthof 
Zauner in the Austrian lake village of Hallstatt. Then I looked at the smile 
that was spreading across my husband's face. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even think of laughing," I whispered in my most threatening tone. "Don't 
say one word until I clean this up." 
</P>
<P>
I worked swiftly, in the camouflage of candlelight, and managed to restore 
order before the waiter returned. 
</P>
<P>
After weighing hearty options from the rich country menu, I had ordered 
cevapici, a veal-and-onion grill I first tasted on the Dalmatian coast of 
Yugoslavia, a few hundred kilometers to the south. And then I decided to add a 
touch of salt. 
</P>
<P>
I shook the container and the lid popped off. It was not salt, it was 
toothpicks. My plate was covered with kindling. Carefully, after uttering my 
threat, I lifted each sliver from the sauce and made a sticky stack on my bread 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"Salt would have been worse," said my husband, still smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Why do those silly scenes hang in the memory, right next to moments of awe and 
beauty? I am convinced it is because travel time is somehow set apart from the 
rest of life; hours become framed in humor or majesty or wonder because they 
are different. They are focused. They are not interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Had I dumped a shaker of toothpicks on my plate at a restaurant at home, I 
would have been too embarrassed to move. A waiter would have whisked the plate 
away before I could consider coping. My host or hostess might have buried me in 
"tut-tut" or "poor darling." 
</P>
<P>
Even the fact there were toothpicks lurking with the condiments says travel. In 
the United States that often happens only in Chinese restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisp Vegetables 
</P>
<P>
The fresh vegetables -- broccoli spears, green beans, slivered red cabbage, 
pillow potatoes -- also were crisp and flavorful at the Gasthof Zauner, an inn 
with 28 rooms within sound of a waterfall at the top of the cobbled Marktplatz 
in Hallstatt. The peasant dishes, from schnitzels to kebabs, were winners. 
</P>
<P>
"A dramatic confession," said my neighbor when I gave her this report, "but you 
misunderstood. I said we were going to Australia next month, not Austria. Where 
should we dine Down Under?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, in Sydney, where I have not yet spilled anything, I would stroll to the 
historic Rocks area, where the British convict ships landed 200 years ago, and 
sit at an outdoor table at the Waterfront restaurant, with its snappy sails and 
flags. I would order that succulent grilled fish called John Dory. Or maybe the 
shrimp cooked with coconut and curry sauce. And probably a cold Tooheys beer. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if the hour were right, I would have a cup of tea at the snack bar at the 
Opera House, and perch on the sun-splashed terrace and watch the endless show 
of Sydney harbor. 
</P>
<P>
For rock oysters, barramundi and other seafood treats, nothing tops Doyle's at 
Watson's Bay, a bracing trip by taxi or boat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late, Light Supper 
</P>
<P>
As a lover of good salads, appetizers and omelets, I would have a late, light 
supper at a table for two on the mezzanine of the Regent Hotel, overlooking the 
splendid lobby with its gentle music. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney pubs of special merit include the Hero of Waterloo, which dates from 
1844; the Metropolitan, downtown at the corner of George and Bridge, and the 
Lord Dudley in the neighborhood of Paddington, called "Paddo" by the 
abbreviation-prone Aussies. 
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, I would go back for spicy Mandarin treats at the Red Lantern in 
Chinatown, which centers around Little Bourke Street, or savor once again the 
fettuccine of Florentino's, where Italian selections are printed on one side of 
the menu, and French on the other. The upstairs rooms at Florentino's are 
old-fashioned, oak-paneled elegant; downstairs is a bistro. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as I told my neighbor, when you do get to Austria next, pause for 
rich coffee and apple pastries at the Cafe Tomaselli, the oldest coffee house 
in Salzburg. Inlaid woods gleam like satin; brass coatracks are hung with black 
umbrellas. Amber lights flicker against scrolled white ceilings in a scene 
framed by gilded mirrors. A wooden rack has brass pegs for 24 newspapers, not 
one of them in English. 
</P>
<P>
They say that young Mozart came here with his father. It is just a few blocks 
from his birthplace. Generations of music students have followed. In the spirit 
of the Old World, I find it cozy to remember that the Cafe Tomaselli was doing 
business in Salzburg long before the first Europeans set foot in Australia at 
the place called Botany Bay.

THE SHOPPER: PARIS: BIG DESIGNERS WITH SMALL PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year is a good time to consider creating a new personal image or giving 
new color and shape to the old one. 
</P>
<P>
It may be time for a new wardrobe, or maybe the addition of one or two basic 
pieces, plus several stunning accessories. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to making acquisitions to enhance a personal style, there's no 
better shopping destination than Paris, where fashion is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Shop windows, billboards, magazines and even people on the street can be 
inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are on the high side, however, but so is style. In general, French 
shoppers buy expensive clothes that wear well and are versatile, rather than 
fads that are pushed aside after one season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budgetary Solution 
</P>
<P>
Economics are important, too. Paris is populated mostly by middle-class people 
who succeed in looking fashionable, despite modest incomes. They buy from 
younger, lesser-known designers with big talents and relatively small price 
tags. 
</P>
<P>
A cluster of boutiques belonging to excellent, varied and relatively unknown 
(to Americans) stylists is in the 1st arrondissement, among some famous 
designer salons. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Sylvie Essel has two shops in the Forum des Halles (Level 2), Paris' 
largest shopping mall. Essel's clothes are beyond seasonal chic. Patches of 
velvet, silk, satin and lace are used to create layered skirts ($120 and up). 
There are color-coordinated sweaters ($150 and up) with applique, beads and 
fringe. Unusual accessories include handbags with bas-relief faces molded into 
the leather ($140), and belts ($40 and up) adorned with feathers, beads and 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is the boutique of Elisabeth de Senneville (3 Rue Turbigo), who worked 
with Jean-Charles de Castelbajac before developing her own line of haute 
sportswear for the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
De Senneville is a good source for basics, sometimes faddish, and affordable 
accessories. Color-coordinated trousers ($50 and up) and well-designed shirts 
($60 and up) are interchangeable staples, inventively detailed and made of 
unusual fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Look for a creative interplay of patterns, vibrant colors and basic black. The 
knit pullovers ($70) can be worn tucked in or belted or baggy. 
</P>
<P>
At 12 Rue de Turbigo, designer Ana Salazar's boutique is a sea of gray, black 
and beige. This Portuguese stylist works frequently with tweed fabrics that are 
mixed and matched in tailored business suits ($200 and up), casual slacks ($120 
and up) and jacket ($160 and up) ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
A distinctive Salazar touch is the use of zippers, on pockets, up pant legs and 
in lieu of slits on straight skirts ($125). The boutique carries a line of 
Portuguese-made shoes ($70 and up) and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, designer Claudie Pierlot (4 Rue du Jour) shows cotton 
clothes in easy-to-wear, flattering shapes. Pierlot's designs are similar in 
mood to those of agnes b., but prices are much lower. 
</P>
<P>
Ensembles are made up of slacks ($60 and up) in a wide variety of shapes, with 
tank tops ($45), turtlenecks ($60), jackets ($100 and up), as well as dresses 
($120 and up). Various sized and reverse-color polka dots are thematic, and the 
sophisticated use of dotted Swiss is especially attractive. Accessories here, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Sara Shelburne's boutique is nearby at 10 Rue du Cygne. American-born 
Shelburne has a large following for her updated retro styles. Her clothes are 
feminine, luxurious and sophisticated. Sequined evening attire ($200 and up) is 
a specialty. Also combed wool and bi-colored day dresses ($145 and up) based on 
1930s fashions. Anything can be made in any size or any of 18 colors, at no 
extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Versatile Ensembles 
</P>
<P>
On a popular fashion street, Claude Barthelemy's boutique (10 Rue Etienne 
Marcel) displays versatile knit, velour and wool ensembles, with varied skirts 
($60 and up), slacks ($60 and up), jackets ($140 and up), dresses ($145 and up) 
and coats ($200 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Barthelemy's clothes also sell in other Parisian boutiques, but since this is 
her own shop, prices are lower. Styles are traditional, well-made, detailed and 
wearable. Colors are rich, but not flashy. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, British designer Vincent Smith (52 Rue Etienne Marcel) outfits 
men in very chic, put-together outfits that mix traditional and avant-garde 
elements. A conventional blazer ($245), for example, is finished off with a Mao 
collar and worn with white front-pleated trousers ($170). 
</P>
<P>
Near the famous Place des Victoires, Island (4 Rue Vide-Gousset) is a new 
designer label for outdoor and sports-oriented clothing for men. 
</P>
<P>
There are woolen V-neck sweaters ($60 and up) in dozens of vibrant colors, plus 
corduroy trousers ($50), sweat shirt ($40) and pant ensembles ($30) and lively 
flowered cotton undershorts ($15). Coats and jackets ($145 and up) are stylish, 
warm and rugged.

ON RECOUPING DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM, Friedheim is editor/publisher of Travel Agent magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently canceled a cruise because of illness, but the cruise line 
hasn't returned my deposit even though I notified them before the penalty 
deadline stated in its brochure. Where can I get satisfaction, since I don't 
want to spend the time or money to sue? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: If your travel agent can't get it or you booked direct, you should 
send your complaint with photocopies of your documents to Department of 
Justice, Office of Attorney General, Public Inquiry Unit, P.O. Box 944255, 
Sacramento, Calif. 94244-2550. Or call toll-free (800) 952-5225. When calling, 
be patient; the line is extremely busy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it still possible to sightsee by air over the Grand Canyon? 
</P>
<P>
A: Several helicopter services fly below rim levels, offering good close-up 
views. Contact your agent or call Grand Canyon Helicopter toll-free at (800) 
528-2418. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a directory of tour operators showing details about their 
experience, time in business, whether they're bonded, references, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Such a register will be published soon. Meanwhile, you should have travel 
agents check this important information for you before booking a tour. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it possible to participate in the annual Greek Marathon that takes the 
original Olympic route? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Marathon to Athens Run on Oct. 23 is free and open to all. For 
registration details, contact the Greek National Tourist Office, 611 W. 6th 
St., Suite 1998, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Four of us want to share a cruise cabin. Are there special rates for this 
number of passengers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Have your agent check those lines that feature quad cabins and who have 
third- and fourth-person fares. These are lower than the two-person tariffs, 
and can be divided to save money for the entire group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q: We're interested in renting a motor home. Is there an organization 
specializing in such vehicles? If so, what are the costs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Numerous local agencies rent these vehicles. GO Vacations is probably the 
biggest company, with numerous branches. For information call (800) 387-3998. 
Vehicle size and season determine daily rates, which are from $16 to $82 a day, 
plus mileage.

I read Dirlam's story on Normandy and, realizing the article was meant to 
promote travel to Normandy and was not a history lesson, it was a nice job. 
However, not only the 1st Infantry Division landed on "Bloody Omaha Beach," but 
so did the 115th and 116th regiments of the 29th Infantry Division. They 
suffered even heavier losses than the 1st Division. I did not serve with the 
29th in 1944, but in 1962. I am writing because the above is rarely told in 
articles about D-day.

PROVIDING A HOME FOR THE URBAN POOR; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA CHURCH, L.A. TEMPLE ACT TO PRESERVE AND FIX UP SKID ROW HOTELS FOR 
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
First, you have to work your way through the milling crowd on the corner. Two 
men, conducting a mock knife fight with real knives, step back obligingly to 
let you past, and someone whispers something about "smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Now you're at the entrance to the Pershing Hotel in the heart of Los Angeles' 
Skid Row, at Main and Fifth streets. It's a battered three-story green 
building, built 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This is not your peaceful little cottage with a picket fence, of course, but 
for the Pershing's residents, it's home. "I'm a poor guy," says 61-year-old Hom 
Gay, who responded to a knock on the door to his little room with a startled 
expression. "I don't have the kind of money to live in a condominium." 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Gay has occupied Room 12 in the 36-room hotel, a 
neat, lackluster space, with most of his possessions perched on a table and 
with a bathroom 50 feet down the hall. His experience with the hotel's 
management, he says, has been bloodlessly efficient: "They just go around 
collecting rents. That's all they care about." 
</P>
<P>
But things are about to change drastically. The Pershing, along with the Hotel 
Roma next door, will soon undergo a major face lift under the sponsorship of a 
Pasadena church and a West Los Angeles temple. And half a block up Main Street, 
workers are putting the final touches on another church-temple project, the 
Pennsylvania Hotel, an airy 30-room building that smells of fresh paint. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the $7-million project, according to spokesmen for Pasadena's All 
Saints Episcopal Church, is to provide clean, comfortable lodging for 
low-income tenants while helping to protect downtown Los Angeles' 
single-room-occupancy hotels from the wrecker's ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving people a place where they can live in dignity -- that's half the 
strategy," said the Rev. Denis O'Pray, All Saints' associate rector. "The rest 
is to preserve Skid Row itself." 
</P>
<P>
It seems an unusual strategy for a suburban church with 3,500 mostly upscale 
parishioners. But anyone familiar with All Saints, an imposing church with 
stone facade and crenelated tower in downtown Pasadena, knows that the dilemma 
of the urban poor is well within its chosen purview. 
</P>
<P>
It's the moral thing to do, suggests the Rev. George Regas, rector of All 
Saints, which has joined forces in the project with the Leo Baeck Temple. "All 
Saints has a history of being involved in many issues far beyond its own 
borders," he says. "Where human suffering goes on, if we can do something to 
diminish it, we'll try." 
</P>
<P>
During Regas' 22 years at the church, its efforts to diminish suffering have 
included operating the San Gabriel Valley's only soup kitchen, declaring the 
church a sanctuary for Central American refugees, co-founding the Interfaith 
Center to Reverse the Arms Race and establishing a "South African ministry" to 
press for the end of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
But the plight of the 8,000 or so residents of 65 Skid Row hotels requires 
emergency action, activists for the poor contend. 
</P>
<P>
Single people living on Social Security benefits or welfare checks, the 
residents of the downtown flophouses (the "would-be homeless," one advocate 
called them) sit in the path of headlong commercial expansion. Skid Row, which 
is part of the 50-block Central City East, must compete for space nowadays with 
Little Tokyo developers, toy manufacturers and produce wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hotels Have Been Lost' 
</P>
<P>
"Look at what happened in other communities," said Ann Sewill, head of the 
Community Design Center, which helped All Saints and the Leo Baeck Temple put 
together the $7-million financing package. "Without intervention, either in the 
form of a moratorium on demolition or a purchasing effort by people not 
interested in speculative land ownership, these hotels have been lost." 
</P>
<P>
After a dozen or so hotels were demolished and most of their tenants put on the 
streets, the Los Angeles City Council approved a demolition moratorium in 1987. 
It has since been extended to next March, but expansion-minded commercial 
interests are keeping the pressure on, says Sewill. 
</P>
<P>
So a group of corporate philanthropists, civic leaders and church 
representatives have come up with the idea of a Skid Row Housing Trust to help 
nonprofit groups acquire hotels and keep them in the single-room-occupancy 
business. "Our goal is to have 10 hotels a year acquired, until the 65 within 
the boundaries of Skid Row have been taken over," said Robert Wycoff, president 
of Atlantic Richfield Corp., who has been active in the effort. "It's a lot 
cheaper than building from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Though the trust is not yet legally constituted as a nonprofit organization, 
its members have leaped in philanthropically on Skid Row. Led by Las Familias 
del Pueblo, a charitable organization that runs a downtown center for the 
homeless, the group has started putting together hotel projects. All Saints has 
worked with the organization on other projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvania, with 30 freshly painted rooms, will be the first completed 
project. The Pershing and the Roma, which will eventually be combined into one 
building, will be done by the end of this year. Together, the three hotels will 
provide low-cost housing for about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation money is available from a variety of sources, says Sewill, 
formerly head of housing for the city of Santa Monica. The church-temple 
project got start-up money from the James Irvine Foundation and the Ralph M. 
Parsons Foundation, then negotiated loans from First Nationwide Bank and 
Citicorp. The state Department of Housing and Community Development and the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, which is purchasing Skid Row hotels itself, 
chipped in long-term loans, and corporate donors invested funds in return for 
tax write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial rents from stores on the hotels' ground floors will pay off the 
loans, while residential rents will pay for operating expenses, including the 
salaries of on-site staff. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, says Sewill, the housing trust will have a revolving fund -- a 
"pre-development pool" -- to help would-be sponsors with their initial 
expenses. "Maybe they really want to help, but they're a little scared about 
marching into a $7-million project on their own," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Social Service Component' 
</P>
<P>
The idea of buying three hotels goes a lot further than providing new 
ownership, says Bill Lane Doulos, manager of the three hotels on Main Street. 
"We're not just renting rooms and picking up the trash," said Doulos, who also 
heads the Union Station soup kitchen in Pasadena, another All Saints project. 
"We'll be providing a social service component." 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be be able to go to one of three hotel managers -- Doulos 
himself will live in the Pershing -- for help with welfare or legal problems. 
"We hope to make it a real warm, human place," Doulos said. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, rents will be even lower than private owners now charge, project 
directors say. Residents of the Pennsylvania will pay between $185 and $225 a 
month, depending on the size of the room and its location. 
</P>
<P>
The layout of the Pennsylvania is much the same as in its former incarnation as 
a fleabag hotel, where "you'd literally step between people making drug deals 
and couples leaving their rooms (after prostitution transactions)," according 
to Doulos. 
</P>
<P>
Individual rooms face a long hallway, with an office near the front. But now 
there is a sitting area, lit by a skylight, and a communal kitchen. There are 
also individual bathrooms with showers, instead of what Doulos calls "gang 
showers," a large room with half a dozen showers in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners and temple members have gone further than just approving the 
project, said Doulos. Some have contributed furniture and building supplies. 
"The nice thing about having two congregations like that is that there are a 
lot of people who know people who have things," he said. "The guy who gave us 
the paint, for example. He didn't go out and buy it; he had it in his 
warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
The two congregations have also organized painting parties, with as many as 120 
people traveling to Skid Row to pitch in at the Pennsylvania. "You had your 
choice of coming Saturday or Sunday," said Doulos, laughing. "The rabbi 
(Sanford Ragins) said you could choose which Sabbath you'd desecrate." 
</P>
<P>
The whole process has been gratifying, said Russel Kully, an All Saints 
parishioner and the vice-chairman of the board that oversees the three-hotel 
project. "It's in the Judeo-Christian tradition," he said.

MENTALLY ILL DRINKERS, ADDICTS GET SPECIAL HELP IN A MOUNTAIN HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Lisa Scales smiles shyly as she chops celery sticks for dinner in the mess hall 
kitchen. But her cautious self-assurance hides an eight-year struggle with 
severe depression and addiction to cocaine, PCP and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old had already been shuttled through eight months of drug and 
psychiatric programs at various hospitals before she arrived at The River 
Community recovery center a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked away in the Angeles National Forest north of Glendora, the 26-bed 
hillside facility opened two years ago. It was the first residential center in 
California to serve chronically mentally ill substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
What makes The River's program different, Scales says, is the sensitivity of 
the counselors to her dual problem. 
</P>
<P>
Funded through a unique collaboration of Los Angeles County's drug, alcohol and 
mental health administrations, The River is the only facility in the county 
providing integrated care for patients suffering from both substance abuse and 
mental illness, a population referred to as the dually diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
Programs administered by the county Mental Health Department and the Health 
Services Department's offices of alcohol and drug abuse provide $500,000 of The 
River's $750,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
A key figure in The River's creation was Christopher Spencer of Monrovia, a 
recovering alcoholic whose 23-year-old daughter suffers from schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were falling through the cracks," the 44-year-old developer said. 
"I know how it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1986, he bought 70 acres in the Angeles National Forest with the idea of 
opening a facility for the dually diagnosed. He fixed up the abandoned 
California Conservation Corps camp which now houses the facility. Together with 
Bud Hayes, now executive director at The River, Spencer went to the county with 
the proposal. Spencer, who is a member of The River's board of directors, 
recently had a satellite dish installed so residents could watch cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it would be a good place for healing, up in the mountains," he said. 
"For the mentally ill it's real nice because we don't have to use locked wards. 
People actually do cooking, go on hikes." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its remote location, residents would have to make a long walk for a 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes noted that a major reason the project was launched so smoothly was the 
site's location. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no community anywhere that's not going to fight this type of project 
in the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The River is just one of Spencer's many forays into the recovery field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he renovated a dilapidated hotel in downtown Monrovia, transforming it 
into a 32-bed treatment and extended-care center for alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that facility along with a 25-bed facility for men in Covina, a 14-bed 
women's home in Arcadia, and a 25-bed center in Silver Lake for both men and 
women make up the Spencer Recovery Centers for recovering alcoholics. The River 
is the only facility run on a nonprofit basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizen of the Year 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, who will receive the Monrovia Chamber of Commerce's Citizen of the 
Year award next month, volunteers at the Weingart Center for the homeless on 
Los Angeles' Skid Row. And he is the Friday cook at the Union Station 
Hospitality Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Substance abusers have been identified as among the most under served of 
California's homeless mentally ill in a February, 1988, report by RAND Corp., a 
Santa Monica-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Providing assistance to the dually diagnosed is a growing issue nationwide, 
said Fred Osher of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He visited 
The River last year as part of a national survey of services available to this 
group, which has been reported to be as large as a million people. 
</P>
<P>
"The River is at the forefront of developing residential facilities" throughout 
the United States and is a model system within California, said Osher. His 
study was partially funded by the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60% to 90% of mentally ill adults between ages 16 and 40 are 
believed to have drug or alcohol problems, according to Hayes. Because of the 
lack of services for the dually diagnosed, he said, many patients have been put 
through a frustrating revolving-door, referred back and forth between drug 
abuse and mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said he is thriving on the challenge of designing an integrated program 
and cross-training a staff that has never tackled the problems of mental 
illness and substance abuse simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me," he said. "It's an 
opportunity that somebody in the nonprofit field hardly ever gets a chance to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design Own Programs 
</P>
<P>
At The River, residents are actively involved in designing their own recovery 
programs. Instead of concentrating on drug therapy and psychoanalysis, the 
focus is on group interaction and developing social support systems. All 
residents participate in community self-help groups, such as Alcoholics 
Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also learn about thought and mood disorders, and they are taught 
independent living and coping skills. In addition to being assigned chores, 
they are given lessons on day-to-day living, such as money management and 
applying for discounted bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who qualify for federal Supplemental Security Income contribute their 
board-and-care allowance of $572 monthly. The remainder of the $3,000 a month 
it costs to treat each person comes from the county. Few can afford to pay 
their own way. 
</P>
<P>
While six extra beds remain empty for lack of funding, about 10 dually 
diagnosed patients are turned away daily, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Clients, 90% of whom are homeless, may stay up to a year, but most leave after 
four months, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the 134 who have left The River are now abstinent, program 
director Julie Boynton said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good for this population," about double the usual success rate, 
said Al Wright, director of the county Department of Health Services' Office of 
Alcohol Programs. He acknowledged that alcohol programs "traditionally are not 
structured to deal with people with mental problems. We'd refer them to the 
mental health system." 
</P>
<P>
Boynton described her clients as often "young, middle-class individuals whose 
families have just run out of the ability to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
One 21-year-old resident, declining to give his name, described the program as 
"God's gift for those who have my problem, and there're lots like us." A 
student in English and political science before his illness interrupted his 
studies, he arrived at The River two months ago addicted to marijuana and 
cocaine and suffering from manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
While receiving psychiatric help in other programs, "they ignored my substance 
(dependency). I had another problem and they couldn't do anything about it and 
I didn't know where to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such fragmentation of treatment is very difficult for this population," 
Boynton noted. State funding policy dictates that separate programs only handle 
the problems they were created for. A more fundamental obstacle, she said, is 
the rigidity of each program. 
</P>
<P>
The mentally ill are often turned away from drug programs because the programs 
forbid them to take any drugs, including their psychiatric medication. 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse counselors are unable to "distinguish between (the drugs') life 
support properties and their narcotic/abusive properties," Boynton said. 
</P>
<P>
More basically, she said, those counselors do not know how to interact with the 
mentally ill. "If you confront a paranoid schizophrenic any way but gently, you 
run the risk of being hit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Irma Stantz, director of the county Department of Health Services' Drug 
Abuse Programs Office, said programs funded by her office aim for a drug-free 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
As long as patients are stable enough to participate they can remain in a 
program, but "there is no physician to oversee (dispensing of drugs) if they 
need a strong tranquilizer or medication for manic depression," she said. 
"We're not a psychiatric facility. . . . If it's clear they're mentally ill, 
they are referred over" to a mental health center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mental health programs are reluctant to test for drug abuse because 
to do so is considered an invasion of privacy, she added. In contrast to the 
traditional approach, in which discussion of the mental illness is not 
encouraged, The River clients are educated about their problems and treatments. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its contract with the county, The River staff shares its experiences 
with county workers at in-service training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Policies need to change, and the way to change those policies is to get people 
educated," said Gary Stansberry, intake coordinator at The River. He recently 
gave a lecture to drug and alcohol counselors undergoing training. 
</P>
<P>
Others are tapping The River's expertise as well. 
</P>
<P>
A private foundation gave the facility $5,000 last year to provide training 
toward developing similar programs in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the facility received $34,000 from the California Community 
Foundation -- which manages charitable contributions by major corporations in 
the state. The funds are being used to develop services for the county's dually 
diagnosed, including up to 30 long-term housing units. 
</P>
<P>
That project should be realized within nine months, Hayes said, adding that the 
facility will provide accommodations for patients' dependents.

W. HOLLYWOOD MOVES TO END TRASH-HAULING CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Gant still fumes about the stinking pile of garbage that stayed on the 
street in front of his West Hollywood home for two weeks last month. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live with something like that for two or three extra days, but two 
weeks?" asked Gant, who persuaded the city to haul it away after the private 
company responsible for his garbage collection failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Across town, Gary Wolper offers another version of West Hollywood's 
all-too-familiar garbage blues. 
</P>
<P>
"For two years, I've had (garbage) trucks clanging up the alley behind my house 
at 4, 5 and 6 in the morning, jarring me awake five days a week," he said. "A 
lot of times, it sounds like they're gonna come straight through the wall." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have heard it before. 
</P>
<P>
And while residents complain that there are too many garbage trucks trundling 
along West Hollywood's streets and alleys, contributing to traffic snarls and 
generating noise at all hours, officials say it isn't without reason. 
</P>
<P>
In a city of just 1.9 square miles, at least 22 companies have a piece of the 
waste-disposal business, often leap-frogging each other on the same block. 
</P>
<P>
"And those are just the legal ones," said City Manager Paul Brotzman, who 
estimates another half-dozen "pirate" companies -- most of them single-truck 
operators -- also do business there. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which officials acknowledge is a confused mess, is a remnant of the 
more loosely regulated days before West Hollywood became a city in 1984, when 
it was still an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Although the County Board of Supervisors last month voted to dissolve the 
arrangement that gives the county jurisdiction over the haulers and award West 
Hollywood control over its own refuse, city officials caution that it may take 
a while to improve the system. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that haulers with legal permits who have been doing business 
in the city for at least three years be given up to five years to phase out 
their operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Badly Needed Order' 
</P>
<P>
"The (five-year) notifications went out last week," Public Works Director Chuck 
Bergson said. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to continue using private haulers, but with permits regulated by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is introduce some badly needed order into the system," he 
said. "You can't do that when you've got a zillion garbage companies doing 
business in an area this small, and you don't have any control over what 
they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the City Council approved a tough new ordinance governing garbage 
collection to take effect when the arrangement with the county expires on June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the proliferation of trash collectors as having created noise, traffic 
problems and chaos, the ordinance sets out strict rules as to how and how often 
trash may be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
It requires haulers to maintain an office accessible by phone six days a week, 
and to keep careful logs of all complaints, which city officials think will 
reduce problems, such as those experienced by Gant. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also requires that garbage trucks be equipped with a broom and 
shovel at all times to clean up spills and outlaws the use of vehicles more 
than 4 years old unless specifically exempted. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county arrangement, a single company is under contract to pick up 
trash from residential customers using garbage containers of 45 gallons or 
less. But there are no restrictions on the number of independent companies 
permitted to haul garbage placed in commercial bins. 
</P>
<P>
The system left landlords and businesses responsible for arranging their own 
garbage pickups with whichever company they chose. Meanwhile, landlords' taxes 
continue to help pay for the service provided to residential customers using 
the smaller containers. That cost is passed on to apartment dwellers, who have, 
in effect, helped to pay for a service they do not use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Service Fee 
</P>
<P>
Once it assumes control, the city plans to impose an annual service fee on 
property owners to pay for collection and disposal, with the amount to be 
decided by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, who say the existing policy was intended to foster 
competition, insist that the policy has worked well in unincorporated areas. 
But city officials say it has resulted in chaos in densely populated West 
Hollywood, where apartment buildings and businesses predominate. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, city officials have no inkling as to when and where the independent 
haulers are operating on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
Although a noise ordinance makes it illegal for haulers to pick up garbage 
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., the law is often ignored. With companies not 
required to account for their daily schedules, officials say enforcement is 
next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"All we get are the complaints," Bergson said. "And many times, the residents 
don't even know who their hauler is. If (the haulers) come too early, or leave 
trash in the street, it leaves us to do a lot of detective work. That's what we 
hope is going to change."

GUS'S SIGN WILL LIVE TO FLASH ANOTHER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Gus's Bar-B-Q sign will stay, even though the building it's attached to has 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old sign at 808 Fair Oaks Ave. has been around so long it has 
achieved historic landmark status worthy of preservation, the City Council 
agreed last week after hearing a public clamor to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Gus's Barbecue itself, which is in a building so badly damaged by the 
Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake that it will be demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
The old-fashioned flashing, animated sign, which was referred to as "an art 
form impossible to reproduce today" and "the highest expression of the American 
Dream" at Wednesday's council meeting, was the biggest issue for the overflow 
crowd. It was granted what amounts to eternal life by officials in a city known 
for its tenacious grip on small-town values in the face of development 
proposals and a freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
80 Boosters at Meeting 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 of Gus's boosters, including descendants of the original owners 
and a waitress who worked there 43 years, packed City Hall to appeal a Planning 
Commission decision to prohibit the sign. The commission ruled in November that 
it violates several provisions of a new ordinance that will go into effect June 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Gus's, a small restaurant started by three Greek immigrant brothers in the 
1940s, has been closed for a year and a half while a second generation has 
pondered its fate. Owners Peter Tripodes and Dino Lappas recently decided to 
rebuild on the same site and to pattern the new restaurant after the old, 
designing the front specifically to show off the landmark sign. 
</P>
<P>
It protrudes higher than the rooftop of its current building, and so will the 
new one. It is animated, with multicolored little pigs and chickens flickering 
around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
The new law prohibits signs that extend above a building. It also forbids 
animation and flashing lights. Although it does not specifically prohibit neon, 
it was intended to control the whirling buckets and glaring arches of fast-food 
eateries that burgeoned a decade ago, Mayor James Woolacott said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has asked the Planning Commission to consider a provision in the 
sign ordinance that would protect signs of historic significance. Signs like 
the one on the Rialto Theater a block away are already protected because the 
structure is a historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Edward Bilezikjian said the new building was designed to integrate 
the sign. "Our concept is the sign is part of the building, not something 
that's attached," he said. Calling it "a fixture in the community and a 
significant landmark," he said it will help the owners get back in business 
after their long absence. Construction is expected to begin in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lappas and Tripodes appealed the Planning Commission decision to the council 
and circulated flyers asking for community support at Wednesday's meeting. Fans 
of the sign came to the meeting and told the council they thought it was 
"charming," "delightful," "whimsical," "significant and historic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Element of Urban Vitality' 
</P>
<P>
Lili Lakich, director of the Museum of Neon Art in Los Angeles, said Gus's sign 
is one of the best of its kind remaining in the Los Angeles area. He said it is 
"symbolic of the American spirit and an element of urban vitality." 
</P>
<P>
Amedee Richards, spokesman for the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation, said 
keeping the sign "is important to the charm and character of our town." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Joseph Crosby said, "I look at this as motherhood and apple pie 
and part of what makes our town unique." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Samuel Knowles asked for the sign's approval "for as long as Gus's 
is in use as a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
"That means forever," Tripodes told well-wishers after the meeting.

WATER DISTRICT'S DECISIONS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this week's Three Valleys Municipal Water District's board meeting is a 
harbinger for what's ahead in 1989, I am extremely concerned for our consumer 
welfare, our water quality, and the quality of the board's decision-making 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the new board, which looks to be spearheaded by Director William Koch 
of Pomona, will support issues that have no real bearing on water quality or 
delivery. His and Muriel O'Brien's discussion of their reasons for not 
supporting the California Health Department's State Drinking Water Program was 
reprehensible. In their shortsightedness, they fail to understand the 
importance of a regulatory agency working in tandem with the EPA as well as the 
full water industry to help clean up much of our underground supply. 
</P>
<P>
Countless times, Mr. Koch has sought measures that would add to his personal 
financial gain and his political platform. Currently he is doing everything he 
can to discredit the general manager, Richard Hansen, and the present board. He 
continues to fuel the fire to the E. F. Hutton investments issue rather than 
attempt to recover the lost monies for "we the people he serves." I am saddened 
to see that one man like Mr. Koch could bungle the district's ability to 
recover the lost monies. Had he not prematurely publicized the matter, the 
district probably would have recovered the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
If Mr. Koch is able to get the votes to oust the present general manager, I am 
certain the district will be further crippled in its ability to provide quality 
service to us, because there will be no real sanity at the helm of this ship. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time that all of us get involved by either attending each and every 
board meeting or reading the board minutes available upon request to protect 
the quality of our water service ahead. We cannot afford the politics and the 
sleazy tactics that Mr. Koch and his ilk have already demonstrated.

COMPTON YOUTHS FLY THROUGH THEIR ROUTINES AND WALK AWAY WITH PRIZES 
</P>

<P>
The Ebony Flyers know how to please a crowd. They crank up the rap music, march 
out on stage in their maroon leotards and sequined silver belts and leap into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
At times moving with the lyric grace of a school of dolphins rising from the 
sea, the 15 Compton youngsters jump, spin and somersault their way across a row 
of tumbling mats to the driving beats of soul, pop and rap songs. 
</P>
<P>
"When they go places and nobody has ever seen them before, the reaction is 
something to watch," Roosevelt Porter, the group's founder and coach, said with 
a touch of pride. 
</P>
<P>
In its 12 years of existence, the acrobatic gymnastics troupe has competed in 
20 amateur performing arts contests, never taking less than first place. 
"They're very skillful and extremely entertaining," observed Victor Dru, a 
Hollywood dance teacher who has organized several regional contests in which 
the Flyers have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
An athletic trainer and gymnastics coach at Compton Community College, Porter 
is a calm, self-assured, 44-year-old who started the troupe under the umbrella 
of the college's community outreach program for children, College for Kids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keeps Them Off Streets' 
</P>
<P>
In a city of gang shootings and entrenched poverty, Porter gives his charges 
patience, discipline and attention. "It helps the kids," said Deborah Ford, 
whose 8-year-old daughter Shavonda Maxwell has trained with Porter since she 
was 4. "It keeps them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Competing against -- and beating -- groups from much more affluent backgrounds 
allows the Flyers to "see the other side of what life is all about," said 
Porter, who graduated from the college in 1976 with an associate of arts 
degree, intending to become an art teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Oh, your kids are from Compton,' and then they roll their eyes," 
he added, smiling because his Compton youths walk away with the prizes. "I have 
something to offer them that they like to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans on Olympics 
</P>
<P>
Shavonda, who recently won a first place in Las Vegas for a solo routine, 
started with Porter after watching a film about a gymnastics star. "She started 
flipping all over my house. I decided to put her in class before she broke 
something," Ford said. "She loves it, says she's going to the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Porter works with about 30 youngsters in the program. He runs a 
baby tumbling group of 4- to 6-year-olds and a beginning group of slightly 
older children preparing for the Flyers, boys and girls ranging in age from 7 
to 26. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week the Flyers gather in the college gymnasium for two hours of 
practice. They don't use parallel bars or beams in their act, concentrating 
instead on mat routines involving tumbling feats. 
</P>
<P>
They execute their moves serially or in unison, often creating a dance-like 
effect. "Everybody who works with this group has to understand they're part of 
a machine," said Porter, who competed in gymnastics as a Los Angeles high 
school student and who choreographs the troupe's routines. 
</P>
<P>
Although an arts major, Porter worked in the college training room to earn 
money while attending Compton, "and it just sort of took hold." He became 
certified as an athletic trainer and has held that position at the college 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked with the College for Kids program while a student. When the 
directors wanted a new course one summer, Porter fell back on his gymnast 
training to start a tumbling class. He used music to help the beginners master 
their timing, incorporating it into the end-of-course performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Parents Went Wild' 
</P>
<P>
"The parents went wild, so I just kept it up, year after year." 
</P>
<P>
Originally all girls, the group was first called the Ebony Jewels. 
</P>
<P>
Several alumnae of the Flyers have gone on to study dance in college, while 
four former members of the troupe who organized their own singing group -- The 
Boys -- recently climbed to the top of the soul charts with their song, "Dial 
My Heart." The four boys sang at the same performing arts competitions in which 
they appeared with the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately Porter says he would like to help Compton youngsters compete at the 
national or even international level. To that end, he is hoping to persuade the 
college and the city to find the facilities to house a full-fledged, community 
gymnastics program. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he dreams up new routines. "I don't want the kids to ever 
think we're doing the same thing. That's boredom."

STRATEGIC BARGAINS ABOUND AT NAVY'S MONTHLY SALE OF SURPLUS ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the market for a bridge, a barge or a C-121 cargo plane? 
</P>
<P>
Has the U.S. Navy got a bargain for you: its monthly surplus sale at the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month -- usually on the third Thursday -- the base's office of defense 
reutilization and marketing auctions such military castoffs along with a slew 
of other goods not normally found at your local mall. 
</P>
<P>
On the block is everything from crates of Army fatigues and steel-toed leather 
boots to electronic missile components to 8-foot-tall isolation booths used for 
hearing tests. 
</P>
<P>
An auctioneer, with a rat-a-tat-tat spiel that could blend in at any county 
fair, even peddles camouflage-speckled pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"The general spread of stuff that Uncle Sam sells," is how the office's 
supervisor, James Orton, describes about 3,000 used, surplus or outmoded items 
sold each year in the center's Building 513. 
</P>
<P>
The goods all were initially purchased by the Department of Defense, but don't 
expect any $640 toilet seats. With a lot of more than 100 aging office chairs 
frequently going for as little as $5, auction prices are rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The khaki castoffs keep a corps of civilian buyers -- many of them from 
military-surplus stores -- in clover. 
</P>
<P>
For Don Erkel, a 55-year-old vendor of industrial photographic equipment, 
attending the Port Hueneme auction and 13 or so other military sales each month 
is practically a full-time job. "Bidding is a 3-day-a-week thing," he said. 
"The rest of the week is filled with picking up the merchandise and bringing it 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The supply of available booty has shrunk since the Vietnam era, when auction 
items covered about 50 acres compared to today's 15, but the number of 
prospective buyers has not dwindled. "They'll never die out," Orton said. 
"There's too much money to be made." 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is one of 21 military bases that conducts auctions statewide, 
doesn't fare badly, either. The sale brings it nearly $220,000 annually -- 
making it one of the larger auctions in the state behind similar sales in San 
Diego, Alameda and Sacramento, said Dan Gibson, chief of marketing for the 
Department of Defense reutilization and marketing service. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide closed-bid sale, in which buyers compete through the mail in 10 to 
12 separate offerings each month for larger items, such as railroad cars and 
aircraft, pads Port Hueneme coffers by an additional $1 million each year. 
</P>
<P>
Even more money is expected from a new sale scheduled for the second Friday of 
every other month -- Feb. 10 is the next one -- in which many of the same goods 
sold at auction will be sold for fixed prices in small quantities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to earning money for the base, the sales spare the military the 
expense of disposing of unwanted items. With landfills charging $70 to $80 per 
ton, the cost can be considerable for such items as a 4,000-pound diesel 
engine, which might otherwise fetch $400, as one did at December's auction, 
Orton said. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone expecting to find the makings for warfare will be disappointed by 
the government garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
To get a howitzer, for instance, a weekend warrior would have to travel to 
Barstow, where the Marine Corps Logistics Base occasionally auctions them, 
Orton said. But the weapon will have been "demilitarized," or reduced to its 
less dangerous components. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boats Available 
</P>
<P>
Boat aficionadoes will have better luck at the Navy's Ream Field at Imperial 
Beach, where small vessels frequently go on the block, along with parts for 
larger ships and planes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Port Hueneme auction occasionally features a barge or a relic of 
anti-submarine warfare, such as the C-121, most surplus sea vessels and 
aircraft that find their way to the Oxnard area usually end up as targets for 
missiles being tested at the nearby Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, 
Orton said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the bulk of what is for sale is decidedly civilian in tone -- 
typewriters, cameras, computers, pickup trucks, physics books, ceiling tile. 
Many items, such as scaffolding, power tools and temporary bridges, reflect the 
base's role as home to the Navy's engineering corps, which during wartime 
precedes troops into battle areas to construct needed roads, airstrips and base 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not all items, which go on display for three days before each sale, will 
be familiar to the average shopper. December's four-page listing of goods 
included such head-scratchers as a "comparator, optical," a "compass-repeater, 
gyro" and "tellurometers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Particular Shoppers 
</P>
<P>
But then, those attracted to the Port Hueneme sale are not average shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Take Ron Vincent, a 43-year-old electrical engineer who owns a small 
hydroelectric power plant in South Dakota. An Oxnard resident, Vincent said he 
has saved thousands of dollars by buying military equipment and adapting it for 
his business. 
</P>
<P>
An example is the steam cleaner he bought at the auction several years ago. It 
now thaws the ice that covers the electricity plant's floodgates during winter. 
An electric winch, bought by Vincent for $100 seven years ago, lifts the 
floodgates, allowing water to hit turbines that generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I really needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent expects to save even more after transporting the two electric cars he 
bought for less than $500 to South Dakota. There he will be able to tap into 
his electrical supply instead of buying gasoline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Competition 
</P>
<P>
But competition can be stiff at the monthly auctions, which began in 1974. 
Regulars tell of a buyer who sometimes bids far more than the value of items to 
discourage newcomers. Another, Orton said, hides his interest by merely winking 
to raise a bid instead of holding up a paddle, as do the other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
"Some like to play the game, 'I don't want my competitors to know what I'm 
doing,' " Orton explained. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone wins. A self-employed engineer who had driven from Bakersfield in 
hopes of buying a typewriter at the December auction went home empty-handed 
after a typewriter repairman from Port Hueneme repeatedly outbid him. 
</P>
<P>
Others complain of the temptation to buy more than they will ever use. Dan 
Layman, the 42-year-old operator of a Ventura auto salvage yard, has steered 
clear of the auction after visiting it for the first time 6 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Layman bought 12 batches of "some junk that I probably didn't need," he said. 
"It took me 2 days off of work just to haul it off. You can get real carried 
away real quick." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cluttered Home 
</P>
<P>
Even Vincent, who has been attending the auction every other month for 15 
years, agrees. He says his home is littered with his purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Four computers clutter one bedroom. In another, seven calculators sit in a 
pile. In his back yard, old lockers, rubber conveyor belts and refrigerator 
insulation have begun to show signs of weathering. And in front of the house, a 
trailer covered in plastic houses the 500 hand-sized transformers Vincent 
bought for a dime apiece, thinking that they would be easy to resell. They were 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like clutter," he said apologetically. "But I don't like to throw away 
anything that has value to it."

SEPARATE SITE FOR LOW-INCOME UNITS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL OKS LUXURY APARTMENTS IN WESTCHESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A developer who wants to build a luxury apartment complex at the Centinela 
Drive-In site in Westchester should be allowed to build required low-income 
housing units at a different location, a Los Angeles City Council committee 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Sage Development Corp., based in Playa del Rey, also succeeded last week in 
persuading the council's three-member Planning and Environment Committee to 
recommend reducing the number of required low-income units from 93 to 63, or 
from 15% to 10% of the planned 624-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will forward its recommendations to the full City Council, which 
is expected to vote on the matter within 30 to 90 days, according to Rick Ruiz, 
a spokesman for Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Galanter represents Westchester and 
is a member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Planning Commission approved the project but unexpectedly 
imposed the requirement for low-income units to be located on the project site. 
The president of the commission said the requirement was appropriate because of 
the need for such housing, particularly in the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Kill Project 
</P>
<P>
At that time, both the developer and nearby residents who had supported the 
project said the last-minute inclusion of required low-income housing could 
kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
George Smart, president of Sage Development, had been working with members of 
the Ladera Heights Civic Assn., which represents about 3,500 households in the 
unincorporated area across the street from the drive-in, since he purchased the 
site in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, a new bus maintenance yard for the Southern California Rapid 
Transit District was planned for the 11.7-acre site at 5700 W. Centinela Ave., 
between the San Diego Freeway and La Tijera Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But residents opposed that project, as well as a proposal for two 15-story 
office towers totaling 750,000 square feet and another plan for a mixed use of 
commercial and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners group had approved the apartment complex, but after the Planning 
Commission imposed the requirement for low-income units, the group reevaluated 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Ronni Cooper, the group's president, said a poll of residents was taken after a 
group of homeowners in November presented the board of directors with a 
petition containing 800 signatures of people opposed to the apartment complex. 
She said the people who presented the petition opposed the project because of 
the additional traffic it could create on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 to 1 Against Complex 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the poll, Cooper said, was 3 to 1 against the apartment complex, 
although only about one-sixth of the residents voted. She said, however, the 
homeowners group also told the committee last week that if the apartment 
project was approved, it should not include low-income units on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"From that standpoint, we're pleased with the (committee's) decision," Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that although the homeowners group withdrew its support, Galanter 
backed the project because she believed there still was a preference for a 
residential project over the industrial and commercial proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter also believes that the project could help reduce traffic by providing 
housing for employees of major businesses nearby, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dieden, a consultant for Sage Development, said he is optimistic that 
the full council will approve the project, which would include among its many 
amenities an on-site child-care center with priority for tenants and a 
recycling center for glass, aluminum and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Dieden said he does not expect any problems finding sites within five miles of 
the drive-in for the low-income units, a requirement made by the council 
committee. He said a decision has not yet been made, but that it is likely that 
the required 63 units would be spread out among two or more facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the City Council approves the project within 30 days, ground 
breaking would be in the fall, and the project would be completed 14 to 16 
months later.

ACTION RETROACTIVE TO LAST JULY 1; 
</P>
<P>
COMPTON POLICE GIVEN 7% PAY INCREASE

<P>
City police officers will be getting bigger paychecks this month, just in time 
to pay their Christmas shopping bills. The City Council last week unanimously 
approved a 7% wage increase retroactive to July 1, when the police union's 
labor contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, which expires in June of this year, a police officer 
will earn between $2,833 and $3,314 a month, depending on his or her level of 
experience. The old contract called for monthly wages of between $2,644 and 
$3,093. 
</P>
<P>
Lieutenants will earn between $4,407 and $5,168 a month, depending on the 
number of years they have held the rank. Under the old contract lieutenants 
earned between $4,113 and $4,820 a month. Sergeants' pay will range from $4,033 
to $4,725 a month, compared to a range under the old contract of between $3,764 
and $4,407 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The 140 police officers will receive their raises, as well as their retroactive 
pay, by the end of this month, said Michael T. Heriot, the assistant city 
manager in charge of labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
The city's approximately 500 other employees, most of whom are represented by 
the Service Employees International Union, received 5% pay raises earlier this 
year. Like the police, SEIU workers have a one-year agreement with the city 
that expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to persuade workers to accept labor contracts that extend 
beyond one year, Heriot said. "I hope maybe we'll be able to get a 2-year 
contract next time around," he said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Tuesday, the council also approved raises for the city clerk, 
the treasurer and the city attorney. The vote was 4 to 1, with Councilman Maxcy 
Filer opposed. 
</P>
<P>
According to city payroll records, the clerk and the treasurer now receive 
$20,544 a year for carrying out their basic city duties. They are also paid, 
however, for additional duties such as supervising city records and acting as 
staff for the city Redevelopment Agency, which brings their yearly earnings to 
about $62,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the council action, their base pay will rise to $26,000 annually 
in July, plus 5% each year after that through 1993. The additional base pay 
will put their total earnings at about $68,000 annually starting in July. 
</P>
<P>
The city clerk is Charles Davis. The treasurer is Wesley Sanders Jr. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wesley Fenderson Jr. is also getting a raise in his basic pay, which 
is now about $12,900 a year. Beginning in July, his basic pay will be $20,246 a 
year. In subsequent years through 1992 his pay will rise by 5% each year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the total annual pay for Fenderson, who also oversees code enforcement 
for the city and does legal work for the Redevelopment Agency, is about 
$73,460. With the increase in basic pay, his total earnings will be more than 
$80,000 in fiscal 1989-90.

GRIEVING ARMENIAN WOMAN OVERCOMES ALL ODDS TO VISIT DEVASTATED HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A few hours after the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia, which killed an estimated 
50,000 people, Kima Panosian announced that she would return to her homeland -- 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"She just sat on the couch that night and said, 'I'm going to go,' " said 
Panosian's 19-year-old daughter, Marine. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Panosian, an engineer from El Monte who heads a small 
construction company in Pico Rivera, had no visa. Forget the 6,000 miles that 
separated her from her native Leninakan or the devastation that she was likely 
to encounter if she could, by a series of lucky breaks, reach her destination. 
She was going. 
</P>
<P>
And she did, reaching her hometown within three days of the earthquake. She 
pulled into Leninakan before dawn on Dec. 10, an implacable figure carrying six 
suitcases full of clothes and antibiotics, among the first outsiders to reach 
the city -- which was about 80% destroyed -- as trapped victims still cried out 
for help from beneath the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very strong woman," said her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Kima Panosian, 46, a statuesque blonde woman with pained gray eyes, last week 
haltingly told the story of her one-week odyssey, which included a sleepless 
intercontinental flight to Moscow, a connecting flight to Armenia, an 80-mile 
drive through the heart of the destruction and an early-morning vision of her 
hometown, rendered unrecognizable by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life, I will have these pictures in my mind," said Panosian, dressed in 
mourner's black in the office of Kima Construction. 
</P>
<P>
Countless people she encountered along the way told her that traveling to 
Leninakan would be "impossible." But Panosian flew to San Francisco and, by 
sheer force of personality, persuaded the Soviet consulate to give her a visa. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the Russian man, 'I need to go to Armenia," said Panosian in broken 
English. "He looks and looks and looks. Then he gives me the visa." She pounds 
the table as if she were stamping a document. 
</P>
<P>
From there, she rushed back to Los Angeles International Airport, where 
relatives waited with her suitcases, and hopped onto the first available flight 
to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I go there, even if I have to walk from Moscow to Yerevan," she said. The 
distance between Moscow and the Armenian capital is about 1,100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday, after another plane ride, she was in Yerevan, where she hired a car 
and driver. "He said, 'I know we not get through,' " Panosian recalled. "But I 
say, 'Let's try.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrived in Leninakan 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozing her way through Army checkpoints ("I explain to everybody, 'My 
family is dead' "), Panosian arrived in Leninakan about 4 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, three weeks after she returned from Armenia, Panosian flounders to 
explain what compelled her. Perhaps it was a deep reflex that sent her 
rocketing through the night. "To be honest with you," Panosian said, "it was 
for me more. You need to do something. You give $100,000 -- that different. You 
need to go touch them, be with them." 
</P>
<P>
Her relatives in Leninakan who lived through the quake understood perfectly. "I 
find them all together in a small room in my mother's house," Panosian 
recalled. "Nobody sleeping. No light, just a small candle. You know what my 
brother said? 'I told you my sister come.' " 
</P>
<P>
She considers her family among the more fortunate. Of 62 relatives in 
Leninakan, 22 were killed, including Panosian's beloved 28-year-old niece, 
Sylvart. 
</P>
<P>
Panosian leafs through a photograph album and points to a picture of a dark, 
serious-looking young woman. "She's a person who was very, very close," said 
Marine, a graphic artist. "Sylvart is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Panosian's 5 days in Leninakan, a small city near the Turkish border, were full 
of nightmarish details. 
</P>
<P>
As a latecomer, Panosian found that she was one of the few who could grasp the 
enormity of the catastrophe. "Some people just walk the streets and think about 
who died that day," she said. "Everybody is asking, 'How many people you lost?' 
Everyone lost thousands. Close friends, people they went to school with." 
</P>
<P>
Her brother spent 14 days digging through the rubble of a refrigeration plant 
where Sylvart, also an engineer, had been working. 
</P>
<P>
"From 25 minutes after the earthquake to 14 days later, my brother worked to 
get her out," said Panosian, who helped the rescue effort by transporting the 
children of the family to homes in Yerevan, 80 miles away. "They know she is 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
But uncertainty was worse than death, Panosian said. "The worst thing is not 
people who lost their families but the ones who don't know where their families 
are," she said.

CUDAHY RENEWAL AGENCY VOTES FOR MEDICAL CLINIC, REJECTS MINI-MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many mini-malls with video rental shops and other small retail businesses 
can this one-square-mile city support? 
</P>
<P>
City officials believe that Cudahy has already reached the limit. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency, following the advice of its administrative staff, 
approved a proposal for a two-story medical clinic, rejecting plans for a 
shopping center on the same site at Atlantic Boulevard and Elizabeth Street. 
</P>
<P>
The staff is convinced that the city is saturated with small shopping centers 
with video rentals, said City Manager Gerald Caton. "Video businesses jump from 
one small development to the other. They are not creating new businesses or new 
customers," Caton said. 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Murray Kane said the shopping center developers were proposing a 
"quality retail development" that would have included a drug store and major 
restaurant. Kane said the city staff's report was incomplete and biased in 
favor of the proposed medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replace Smaller Clinic 
</P>
<P>
The $9-million medical building, to be operated by a division of Kaiser 
Permanente, Kaiser Hospital Foundation Health Plan Inc., would serve about 
100,000 patients and replace a smaller clinic in Huntington Park that would be 
closed. It would employ about 100 people, including doctors and support staff. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, a nationwide health-care organization, would bring prestige and attract 
potential shoppers from outside the city, but would not compete with the 
existing retail centers, Adolfo Reta, director of Community Development, told 
the agency directors before the 3-0 vote for the medical building. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize Atlantic Boulevard needs a mix of development. A medical office is 
a good development," Reta said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center had been proposed by Gateway Triangle Development Corp. of 
Los Angeles. Farshad Safaie-Kia, the president of Gateway, said in an interview 
that the company had been negotiating with such major tenants as a drug store, 
sporting goods store, a shoe store and a restaurant. He said he could not 
reveal their names. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center would have generated an estimated $203,000 in revenues from 
sales taxes and property taxes in its first year, compared with $122,000 from a 
medical clinic. Total tax revenues from the shopping center would have climbed 
to an estimated $333,000 in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Vacancy Rate 
</P>
<P>
But Reta said the Gateway project could hurt "overall retail effort. (Gateway) 
will bring in a doughnut shop and video rentals. We got all that now." The city 
already was experiencing a high vacancy rate in its retail development center 
along Atlantic Boulevard, the city's main thoroughfare, Reta told the agency 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"Staff believes that the development of another retail strip center would only 
exacerbate the already increasing problem of failing business due to the 
inability of attracting trade from outside the city," Reta said in the prepared 
report to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Reta said the city would conduct an inventory soon to determine the exact 
number of mini-malls in the city and what each contained. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 agency vote came after very little discussion. Agency Chairman Bill 
Colon abstained. Another agency member, Gabe Zippi was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Agency member John Robertson said: "Both proposals (Kaiser and Gateway) are 
interesting but we can't put both on the same site. I'm thinking about the 
future development of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Colon said in an interview that he abstained because he had questions about 
both projects. "I'm concerned about Kaiser and (the amount of) sales tax 
revenue. I'm also concerned about mini-malls. I look around and see empty 
stores in the city," said Colon, who is also mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kaiser and Gateway own land in the 4-acre area in the agency's 
redevelopment district. Kaiser owns about an acre of land in which an abandoned 
building is located. Gateway owns about two acres, the majority of which is a 
parking lot. Two other private residences take up the remaining space. 
</P>
<P>
The agency and Kaiser must now work out a way to get the remaining land needed 
for the project, which could mean acquiring the land through condemnation 
proceedings. Gateway has said it would not be willing give up its land, Reta 
said. Kane, the Gateway attorney, said he would not comment on what the company 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kaiser said the private owners have expressed a willingness to 
sell.

SCHOOLS GET LOW MARKS FOR ASBESTOS;

POLITICAL BICKERING, BUREAUCRACY SLOW CLEANUP PROCESS

<P>
All students and staff of public primary, elementary, junior high and senior 
high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, 
secure and peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Article I, California 
</P>
<P>
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
If report cards were handed out to California's 1,028 school districts and 
private schools, grading them on asbestos abatement awareness and compliance 
with the 1986 Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, very few would score a a 
passing mark, according to a number of experts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
What surfaces from an overview of the asbestos problem in schools is a 
hodgepodge of confusion, political bickering, an ingrained don't-rock-the-boat 
attitude within the school system bureaucracy, charges that the Environmental 
Protection Agency has failed to establish clear rules for determining asbestos 
health risks, and complaints that federal deadlines are unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents have begun to question the safety of the classroom 
environment and are not getting straightforward answers. 
</P>
<P>
One concerned mother, whose child is a first-grader at Beverly Vista Elementary 
School, said: "I have always trusted the school system completely in matters of 
safety. Now, I don't know what to believe." 
</P>
<P>
At Beverly Vista, one of five school sites in the Beverly Hills School 
District, four classrooms, including a kindergarten setting, were recently 
found to contain friable asbestos in a disintegrated form within the ceiling 
structure. The school is currently undergoing abatement in these critical 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Asbestos Cleanup legislation of 1986, which arose from dissatisfaction with 
existing EPA efforts to regulate asbestos, mandated that the nation's schools 
clean up hazardous asbestos on their premises and required the EPA to issue 
standards for school inspection, cleanup and disposal of the insulating 
material. 
</P>
<P>
If friable asbestos-containing materials are found in schools, the Emergency 
Response Act requires not only inspections by EPA-accredited consultants but an 
asbestos management plan for ongoing control of the release of asbestos fibers, 
even when the materials do not pose an immediate hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The management plan also activates immediate repair of damage and building 
cleanup, where needed, and requires all school maintenance and custodial staff 
to be trained through EPA-approved courses. 
</P>
<P>
One of the inconsistencies of EPA guidelines, said one asbestos consultant, is 
that the agency has left it up to the individual states to implement the format 
and design Contractor Accreditation Plans, resulting in a wide range of quality 
control standards. Under previous regulations issued in 1982, schools were 
required to inspect for asbestos and to notify parents and employees of the 
results. But EPA rulings at that time did not explicitly mandate schools to 
take remedial action. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today, the magnitude of the asbestos cleanup problem in schools is 
clearly not understood by vast numbers of untrained people assigned by school 
administrators to see that the new requirements are carried out," said Gordon 
Goldman, president of Asbestos Environmental Controls, a Torrance-based 
asbestos inspection and consulting firm, whose clients currently include school 
districts in Illinois, Louisiana and California, including 25 school districts 
within Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Short-Changed 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, I do not believe the responsibility for the asbestos problem in 
schools should be assigned to business or insurance risk managers within the 
school districts who have little or no knowledge of the dangerous consequences 
in the poor handling of hazardous substances," added Goldman, who has a 
doctorate degree in organic chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think parents have been short-changed. One simply cannot treat a 
life-threatening issue, in the same routine fashion as ordering 100 bags of 
potatoes for the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time and special skills to do a good job," said Goldman, who believes 
the federal deadlines are too stringent and that many of the districts have 
pushed through shabby inspections. "There are simply not enough people to do 
the job. We need at least twice as many qualified inspectors as we have now." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, whose crew targeted the critical areas at Beverly Vista in a 
preliminary inspection, said he also found evidence of potentially dangerous 
asbestos conditions at Beverly Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acted Immediately 
</P>
<P>
Mike Farrow, director of maintenance for the Beverly Hills School District, 
said the district sites had undergone previous asbestos inspections and that 
corrective work had been done in the past. "I believe we have a handle on this 
problem now," he added. "At Beverly Vista, we acted immediately to remedy the 
situation after the problem was pointed out to us. We certainly don't want our 
students exposed to a dangerous environment." 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the level of airborne fibers inside asbestos-containing 
buildings varies little from the level outside the buildings (in California it 
is fairly well impregnated with airborne fibers from the weathering of native 
serpentine rock and dust from other building materials). The increased risk of 
asbestos-related health hazards in schools, arises when school officials fail 
to monitor these conditions, through regular inspections and implementation of 
corrective measures, before a critical condition develops, said Peter 
MacDowell, a Los Angeles-based asbestos abatement expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Friable asbestos in a crumbled form can literally fall through cracks. In each 
instance where friable asbestos surfaces are disturbed, by varying degrees of 
contact to its surfaces, by water damage from a leaky roof or pipe or 
dislodgement caused by earth tremors, friability will occur, and minute 
airborne particles will make their way into the air stream," MacDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
How often are plants or decorations hung unwittingly from a ceiling in a 
classroom, containing asbestos? How often are acoustic tiles shoved aside by 
untrained custodians to access ceilings where beams have been sprayed for 
fireproofing and insulation with friable asbestos substances? MacDowell said 
"the same can happen when an untrained repairman replaces a phone or electric 
line or, even worse, breaks into an asbestos treated area to connect a computer 
terminal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personally Liable 
</P>
<P>
He urged that parent-teacher organizations should take a pro-active stance. 
"Every school should form a committee of interested parents to demand full 
disclosure of progress of prudent response to AHERA requirements. What people 
are not aware of is that the local asbestos designee for a school district is 
in fact personally liable for his actions. That, in itself, I'm sure, has not 
been conveyed to those responsible. I wonder how many of them ever really read 
the act." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government's asbestos emergency response legislation, sponsored by 
Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.) and signed by President Reagan on Oct. 22, 1986, 
bears down on the problem with new, strict standards for asbestos contractor 
certification and training, inspections, lab accreditation and procedures for 
asbestos management and abatement programs in the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Compliance, however, has not been that simple and school officials fear that 
when management plans are completed and a full schedule of abatement work is 
determined, they will not be able to meet the high costs of such management. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the complexity and confusion about the asbestos problem, of what is 
dangerous and what is not, both from a technical and health standpoint, the 
tendency in some sectors has been to minimize the danger of this environmental 
problem, leading some lawmakers to wonder whether the issue has become too 
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Thoughts 
</P>
<P>
Parents who voted for Proposition 79 (approved on the Nov. 8 ballot) and were 
led to believe that the School Facilities Bond Act (Proposition 79) 
specifically set aside "up to $100 million to be used for the identification, 
assessment and abatement of hazardous asbestos," should be aware of second 
thoughts by some members of the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A lobbyist for the California School Boards Assn. said that on Nov. 30, the 
State Allocation Board discussed limiting Proposition 79 funds for asbestos 
work in schools in favor of using more funds for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
Such redrafting of guidelines by the board does not require voter approval, he 
emphasized, adding that the only schools currently qualifying for allocation of 
funds from Proposition 79 are those where the asbestos problem is so critical 
that the school is shut down. Under that scenario, only the Hiram-Johnson 
School in the Sacramento Unified School District has qualified, thus far. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the issue in perspective, asbestos experts offer reassurance that all 
asbestos in buildings is not dangerous, that some 3,000 asbestos products were 
used in construction prior to 1973 for structural fireproofing, acoustical 
ceilings, pipe and boiler insulation or furnace systems but that these 
differences have not been brought to the attention of the Resource and Recovery 
Act, the Congress or the public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks 'Overstated' 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to clarify these differences," said Ed Kennedy, a K &amp; D 
asbestos consultant, formerly involved with inspections within the Beverly 
Hills School District and currently overseeing some of the work being carried 
out in various school districts. "The word asbestos, as used in the law, is too 
generic a term for a large group of minerals of different chemical compositions 
and morphology which are not equally carcinogenic or health hazardous." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert N. Sawyer, a Connecticut-based consultant in industrial medicine, 
believes the EPA has overstated the risks in schools and neglected to clarify 
and communicate the variables connected with friable asbestos exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Any asbestos-containing material does not necessarily represent a threat to 
human safety. I would rather see more emphasis and regulation by the EPA on 
cigarette smoking, which poses a much higher health risk to young lungs. Those 
most at risk from asbestos in schools are the maintenance and custodial workers 
working in areas where friable asbestos is found," Sawyer said, "although, in 
certain instances, where children are directly exposed to friable asbestos, a 
definite health hazard could exist and that should be corrected." 
</P>
<P>
In EPA terms, Kennedy stated, friable asbestos means asbestos that, when dry, 
can be crumbled with light to harder hand pressure and can be so fragile that 
all one has to do to dislodge is to blow on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Relationship 
</P>
<P>
"But we must also remember that some asbestos sprayed on for insulation and 
fireproofing carries a cementitious binder or mineral fiber binder that makes 
it more resistant to crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA "Purple Book," issued in June, 1985, states that "there is no direct 
information on health risks from exposure to asbestos in buildings with 
asbestos-containing materials, so the risks are estimated by extrapolation from 
studies of asbestos industry workers." 
</P>
<P>
A once-common building material, asbestos is linked to asbestosis, lung cancer 
and mesothelioma (also known as black lung disease) in individuals with a 
history of prolonged or excessive exposure to high levels of asbestos fibers. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA report also notes that "asbestos exposure in children is of special 
concern, since they (the children) have a greater remaining life span than 
adults and their lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma is greater. Avoiding 
unnecessary exposure to asbestos is prudent." 
</P>
<P>
MacDowell believes "if we must overreact in some undefined health and safety 
issues where children are concerned, then let us all be on the side of 
conservatism, until such time as more accurate data and statistics become 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"As adults we have a choice as to our work conditions but the children who are 
sent off to school every morning to an asbestos-laden site, don't have that 
choice."

DICK TURPIN: L.A. AREA OUTLOOK IS UPBEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Turpin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forecasts about the state of real estate abound at this time of year and the 
outlook for the Los Angeles area is, as it has been for some time, upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
The authoritative seers expect a continuation of the city's growth as the 
nation's co-financial capital with New York and predict considerable additions 
of new high-rise office space, while housing, after two big years and despite 
upward repricing of homes, is headed for another solid year. 
</P>
<P>
For the downside of housing -- the affordability factor and the homeless -- 
there is only scattered hope for improvement as prices maintain their costly 
levels and solutions to the homeless problem progress very, very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
But in commercial realty, near-record activity is anticipated throughout the 
1,000-square-mile Los Angeles basin, spurred again by foreign investments, 
while the remainder of the country is expected to experience a softening in its 
various major market areas. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back to set the stage for his firm's annual forecast Tuesday, John G. 
Russell, president of the western region of Grubb &amp; Ellis Co., notes that 
since 1980, the basin has added 500,000 jobs and 1 million more people. During 
that period, it became the nation's high-tech leader, more than doubled the 
value of its international trade and doubled its inventory of occupied office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The basin or metropolitan area extends from the Orange County line to the south 
to Ventura County on the north and from the ocean east to the San Gabriel 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"This performance has been particularly stunning considering that almost all 
other large metropolitan areas in the industrialized world either declined 
during this same period or experienced only modest growth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the next two years, Russell and a number of his cohorts see: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least 8 million square feet of new office space being absorbed in 1989, 
a 7% addition to the existing 132 million square feet throughout the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vacancy rates rising somewhat this year from the current 15% rate as the 
new space becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Industrial space, in smaller leasable segments, increasing this year among 
new growth industries throughout the Antelope, Conejo, Santa Clarita and San 
Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Retail development continuing strongly throughout the basin with much 
replacement and rehabilitation of existing shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, 11.4 million square feet will be completed, with downtown Los Angeles 
and West Los Angeles accounting for more than 50% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Russell and his staff cite the basin's diverse economy, its port facilities, 
its position in the Pacific realm, increases in its population and its labor 
force. 
</P>
<P>
How long can this heady pace continue? 
</P>
<P>
While the figures in the future may not be as impressive as they have been, the 
basin will continue "to be the largest growth market in the nation," Russell 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the national housing front, information from RE/MAX real estate 
sources indicates that during the third quarter of 1988, it was tougher -- 11% 
longer than the second quarter -- to sell the typical resale house. 
</P>
<P>
While it took an average of 92 days nationwide, in California, it took only an 
average of 38 days to chalk up a sale.

DROP IN HOME BUILDING SEEN; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHER INTEREST RATES WILL MAKE IT TOUGHER FOR BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing construction is expected to decline about 5% this year and sales will 
drop about 4% as the nation's housing market cools down from a feverish 1988 
and higher interest rates make it even tougher for Americans to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, home prices are expected to rise about 5 1/2% -- roughly in line 
with the overall inflation rate. But continued strong demand and a shortage of 
homes for sale should push the price of a typical California home up a heftier 
8%, with even larger increases predicted for most parts of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going to slow down in 1989, but it will still be a pretty good year 
for housing," says John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weakness in Northeast 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no crash in the nation's housing market." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some parts of the country will feel the slowdown more than others. 
</P>
<P>
Construction and sales alike are expected to continue dropping in the 
Northeast, a region that is still trembling from the stock market crash of 
October, 1987. The region was the nation's hottest housing market through much 
of this decade, but overbuilding and the loss of 20,000 financial-services jobs 
in the wake of the crash have left sellers outnumbering buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is much brighter in the Midwest, thanks to a resurgence of the 
manufacturing sector and a firming agriculture business. 
</P>
<P>
"The Midwest missed out on a lot of this decade's housing boom," says Tuccillo. 
"But now its economy is picking up, and that is helping its housing market." 
</P>
<P>
Sales and construction in the South are expected to remain relatively sluggish 
as the region's economy continues to suffer from the depressed energy business. 
</P>
<P>
But California's housing market is expected to remain strong, thanks to the 
state's vibrant economy, a near-record low inventory of homes for sale and a 
scarcity of buildable land in many parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
About 513,800 existing California homes are expected to be sold this year, down 
7% from 1988, predicts the California Assn. of Realtors. But last year's sales 
pace was the best in the decade, notes CAR chief economist Joel Singer, so 
"even with a 7% drop in sales, we're looking at a very good year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double-Digit Price Gains 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the price of a typical California home will rise about 8.2%, to 
$177,500 this year, Singer predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Singer says Southland prices will probably rise even faster than the statewide 
average, with Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties all logging 
double-digit price gains. 
</P>
<P>
About 216,000 new houses, condominiums and apartments will be built in 
California this year, 13% below the number of new homes built in 1988, 
according to the Burbank-based Construction Industry Research Board. 
</P>
<P>
However, the expected decline in California's construction rate won't trigger a 
wave of layoffs in the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Construction Jobs 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of builders got their (construction) permits last year, but their 
projects haven't gotten started yet," says Ben Bartolotto, the board's research 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we'll probably see the number of construction jobs go up a bit this 
year after these projects get under way." 
</P>
<P>
Other housing-related developments to watch for in 1989: 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of a far-reaching federal housing bill. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) are expected 
to introduce their proposed "National Affordable Housing Act" in the 101st 
Congress, which opened last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax-Deferred Savings Account 
</P>
<P>
Among other items, a draft of the bill calls for making low down-payment 
Federal Housing Administration loans available to more buyers in high-cost 
housing states, such as California, New York and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would also allow would-be buyers to put a portion of their 
earnings into a tax-deferred savings account that could eventually be tapped 
for a down-payment on a house. People who already have an Individual Retirement 
Account could draw their money out without penalty if the cash would be used to 
buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
More private-sector help for the homeless and low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), who'll head the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development in the Bush Administration, is expected to push for tax 
breaks and other incentives to get private-sector builders more involved in 
moderate-income housing and inner-city redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp is also expected to push for expansion of the controversial "voucher" 
program -- in which poor people seek out apartments owned by private-sector 
landlords and then use a government voucher to pay for part of their rent -- 
and for programs that let tenants in public-housing projects buy their rental 
units. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model for Other Cities 
</P>
<P>
More cooperation between builders and slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
After bitter battles, about half of the slow-growth measures on local ballots 
last November were approved, and several others lost by thin margins. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say an agreement hammered out between developers and 
environmentalists in San Bernardino last month could be used as a model for 
other cities. The pact calls for growth to be channeled into already urbanized 
areas and for builders to pay for new roads, sewers and other facilities needed 
by new residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to trade some possible speculative profits for a certain amount 
of stability," San Bernardino builder representative Joseph DiIorio told The 
Times last month. "Also, we're kind of tired of being called the bad guys and 
we'd like to leave something behind in the way of careful planning."

SAM HALL KAPLAN: WISH LIST FOR A BRIGHTER NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consistent with the tradition that the New Year be welcomed in with expressions 
of hope, this first column of 1989 is my wish list for select persons and 
institutions involved in the design and development of Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
* That in the anticipated mayoralty campaigns the candidates actually address 
the increasing concerns of communities for more environmentally conscious, 
user-sensitive and neighborly planning and design. But the debates and 
discussions should not be in the usual campaign jargon flooded with slogans and 
generalities, rather in specific programs for specific problems and 
neighborhoods. It is time that such reports as "LA 2000," "Housing Los Angeles" 
and "Vision Van Nuys" start being implemented, instead of filed away. 
</P>
<P>
* That the Los Angeles City Council clean up its act on how developers are 
selected for city-owned land. If the city ever expects to attract responsible, 
design-conscious proposals, it cannot allow a repeat of how the more 
architecturally sensitive, community-supported Showa proposal for Little Tokyo 
was torpedoed by a politically well-connected, and well-financed consortium. 
And then some council members wonder why they are consistently booed at 
community meetings they dare attend. 
</P>
<P>
* That now that the city has taken title to El Pueblo Park downtown, it 
encourage the proper restoration and maintenance of the historic area, as 
promised. This means respecting the potential of the fragile landmarks there 
while not short-changing local merchants of long standing by yielding to 
political interests fronting for special interests out to make a quick buck, as 
has been indicated in recent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
* That now that those involved in the farcical West Coast Gateway competition 
have milked it for their own promotion, the "winning" scheme be scrapped and 
the search for a distinguishing design for Los Angeles be turned over to more 
responsive and responsible leadership. To even think in this time of need that 
$33 million (not coincidentally a very low-ball estimate) be spent on the 
scheme, even if privately raised, borders on the irresponsible. Once again 
Mayor Bradley has backed a loser. 
</P>
<P>
* That the city's Community Redevelopment Agency recognize and encourage the 
continuing self renewal of the West Adams area and once and for all scrap the 
proposal to dismember the Menlo Avenue and 29th Street Historic District for a 
shopping center. We understand too well the agency's desire to yield to 
political and special interests that can deliver votes on the council to ease 
its credit crunch, but it shouldn't be at the cost of a community's frail 
architectural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
* That the plan for Central City West, now in its final throes of preparation, 
fulfill its promise as a model for community responsive growth. In particular, 
that the pockets of inexpensive housing now there be protected, while new 
housing is developed, along with needed new schools and parks to provide a 
community fabric for the inevitable commercial complexes. On the line is the 
case for responsible private development. 
</P>
<P>
* That the Department of Water and Power recognize that in addition to 
protecting our water quality it also has a responsibility to protect our 
environment, and therefore should provide a reasonable and aesthetic solution, 
or alternative, to covering the reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
* That now that some avaricious developers have discovered the community 
character and potential of Northeast Los Angeles, in particular Mt. Washington, 
Highland Park and Lincoln Heights, zoning there be strengthened to protect that 
character so as not to undermine the potential. 
</P>
<P>
* That the ambitious proposal by the Trammell Crow Co. to develop the former 
Samson Tire, cum Uniroyal, structure in City of Commerce as a retail, office 
and hotel complex becomes a reality. Located alongside the Santa Ana Freeway, 
the rambling structure, with its evocative facade in the form of an Assyrian 
Palace, is one of Southern California's more prominent architectural landmarks. 
Having withstood waves of vandals and unfriendly thoughts of demolition, it 
deserves a new life. 
</P>
<P>
* That the Marketplace in Old Pasadena, having been finally marketed, or so we 
have been told, respect the funky context and tone of Colorado Boulevard, and 
not turn the block into a Rodeo Drive east. 
</P>
<P>
* That the architectural conservation program of the Getty get into gear, 
recognize its particular obligation to its host community, and begin making a 
difference by helping to preserve local landmarks. The best of intentions by 
the Getty and the promise of new technology and trades unfortunately will not 
stop the south wall of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Ennis-Brown house in Los 
Feliz, and a host of other local landmarks, from continuing to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
* That the recent exchange program between the Southern California Institute of 
Architecture and the Moscow Institute of Architecture having been so 
successful, at least socially, other exchange programs be considered. One that 
might prove interesting would be between the architecture and planning 
departments at UCLA, two tenure-crippled entities that in the past seem to have 
been working at cross purposes though under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
* That the historic and innovative Eames House in Pacific Palisades be acquired 
by an institution, perhaps the Getty or a university, to be used as a residence 
for visiting scholars or critics, and be respected and preserved. 
</P>
<P>
* That the Los Angeles Prize, sponsored biannually by the local chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects, be given this year not for some futurist 
concept, as it was last time, but to address the more immediate problem of 
providing shelters for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
* That ways be found to save our old, architecturally distinctive theaters and 
movie studios, as well as such institutions as the Variety Arts Club, to remind 
us of our rich heritage as the dream capital of the world. If Los Angeles has a 
soul, my guess is that it is embodied in part in such structures as the Million 
Dollar and Los Angeles theaters on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The passing of another year, and the ringing in of the new, prompts such

DISNEY CONCERT HALL COLUMN WINS PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Hall Kaplan's column (Dec. 11) was an important advance article regarding 
the selection process of an architect for the Walt Disney Concert Hall. His 
encouragement of the Frank Gehry proposal meant a great deal to the committee 
in making its final choice. I want to thank him for writing about the selection 
process in such a positive way and for his early encouragement of what I hope 
will be an important cultural project for Los Angeles.

FOUR CALIFORNIA HOTELS NAMED AMONG 10 BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four California hotels -- in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Century City and San 
Diego -- are among the top 10 best new hotels in the world, according to Travel 
&amp; Leisure magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The JW Marriott at Century City, a 375-room, 17-story hotel, was singled out by 
writer Paul B. Finney in the magazine's December, 1988, issue, as deserving "an 
Academy Award for 'Best Performance by a Major Chain."' 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels on the list: Regent Beverly Wilshire, Los Angeles; Four Seasons 
Biltmore, Santa Barbara; Le Meridien, San Diego; Westin Kauai, Hawaii; Hyatt 
Regency Waikoloa, Hawaii; Grand Floridian, Walt Disney World, Florida; 
Royalton, New York City; Hotel 21 East, Chicago, and Club Med, Huatulco,

DEAR DALE: HEAVY TEXTURE NEEDS KNOCKING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dale Baldwin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I remember reading some time back of a method to wallpaper over 
textured walls, namely sheet rock or heavily textured wallpaper. Our problem 
with our condominium unit in Koloa, Kauai, Hawaii, is 1,400 square feet 
completed "finished" in textured drywall. Is there a product that will cover 
the texturing so we can wallpaper the condo? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If the wall is heavily textured, you'll have to remove the texture and 
proceed from there if you're interested in wallpaper, advises Joel Roses of 
Dunn-Edwards, president of Western Wallcovering Distributors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
If the texture is not so heavy, any wallpaper dealer should have a covering 
material that will keep the stipple from showing through, he said. Roses 
doesn't like the overwhelming tendency of California builders to texture walls 
and ceilings; I couldn't agree with him more. Texturing covers a multitude of 
sins, including low-quality drywall work. 
</P>
<P>
According to a sampling of 200 home shoppers in new-home tracts in Los Angeles, 
Orange and Riverside counties, nearly 70% prefer a smooth surface over a 
textured one; a majority of those surveyed would be willing to pay extra for a 
non-stippled surface. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of these home shoppers said they plan to use wall covering in some 
area of their new home, supporting their preference for smooth-finished walls, 
Roses said. To this I add a hearty Amen! 
</P>
<P>
IN THE MAIL: Professional Builder's Mid-September issue predicts that 
residential remodeling expenditures in the United States will top the $100 
billion mark this year -- the first time this magic number will be exceeded. As 
usual, Los Angeles will continue to be the biggest single remodeling market, 
according to Lisa Gilmore writing in the trade publication. She added that the 
Midwest and Northeast will continue to be the main areas of remodeling in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that the magazine's circulation is limited to members of the 
building community. This particular issue is devoted to bathroom and kitchen 
remodeling, and most of the jobs illustrated and described are applicable to 
the real world most of us inhabit. Many of the remodeling jobs in consumer 
publications are high-end in the extreme. The magazine should be available at 
larger public libraries or from a friendly builder or contractor.

HOME IMPROVEMENT: KNEELING ON JOB CAN BE MORE COMFORTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dale Baldwin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many jobs around the home require working on one's knees, a position that 
becomes uncomfortable after a short time. Seeking an effective solution to the 
problem, a group of Norwegian designers, physical therapists and engineers came 
up with an effective solution: the Balans Craftseat. 
</P>
<P>
The product, produced and marketed by Amcraft Inc. of Idaho Springs, Colo., 
combines a kneepad and stool that provide support for the knees, while at the 
same time providing a seat. The ankle joint remains free of stress and may move 
to retain normal circulation to the feet, while the angle of the knee bend 
stays open enough so that circulation is not cut off at the knee, as is usual 
when one kneels for a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are laying carpeting or tile, painting a floor or gardening, the 
Craftseat could make those jobs a lot easier. Those who have done similar work 
know that kneepads help somewhat, but this product goes much further to relieve 
the strain of working on one's knees. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftseat is made of high quality aluminum, according to the manufacturer, 
and the seat and kneepads are made of dense polyurethane foam designed with a 
specific degree of hardness for comfort. The pads are internally reinforced and 
their cellular core structure provides for long-term durability. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftseat components can be used as a pair or a single unit and the 
easy-off adjustable straps allow for freedom of movement. 
</P>
<P>
Amcraft claims that during product testing with floor installers, workers' 
productivity increased between 40% and 50% and fatigue was reduced to a 
minimum. Workers who had been plagued by knee problems found that they were 
minimized with use of the Craftseat. Some problems were totally eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The Craftseat is available in the Los Angeles area at Walton Tool Co., 517 W. 
17th St., Long Beach; Galleher Hardwood, 12906 Telegraph Road, Santa Fe 
Springs, and McMaster-Carr Supply Co., 9630 Norwalk Blvd., Santa Fe Springs. 
The manufacturer's suggested list price is $39.95 for a single, and $69.95 a 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
The firm can be addressed at P.O. Box 3335, Idaho Springs, Colo. 80452.

TIPS TO HOMEOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Armand L. Fontaine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have been told that I should not use an architect when doing a home 
improvement project, such as adding a room or extending walls. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I think there has been a great deal of architect bashing in connection 
with home improvement projects. On many smaller or simple projects, it is not 
necessary to have an architect. Many home improvement contractors have 
qualified draftsmen who can design the basic programs. However, I recommend 
using an architect on any sizable project. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the better home improvement contractors receive the bulk of their 
business from architects. One contractor told me that 70% of his work comes 
through architects. These projects are usually large in scale, highly 
customized and ambitious in concept. Architects for home improvements must be 
very practical in their concepts to avoid cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a good architect should be based on the experience, the type of work 
and the craftsmanship on previous projects. Do not be afraid to check out an 
architect, as you would a contractor.

GROUND BREAKING HELD FOR 35-STORY DOWNTOWN TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, commercial realtor John C. Cushman III and officials of 
Manufacturers Real Estate, Toronto, attended a ground-breaking ceremony for the 
$200-million, 35-story 865 South Figueroa building. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in June, 1990, the 681,000-square-foot tower at the 
northwest corner of 9th and Figueroa streets will incorporate the landmark 
Original Pantry restaurant -- on the site for more than 60 years -- as part of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 75 people attending the Oct. 27 program were Sidney F. Dakin, vice 
president of Manufacturers Real Estate, and John Paton, the firm's vice 
president of development. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be our second major office building in the financial core of the 
downtown area," Dakin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first is the 392,000-square-foot ManuLife Plaza at 5th and Figueroa, which 
was completed in 1985." 
</P>
<P>
Cushman's firm, Cushman Realty Corp., will handle leasing for the new building; 
the architect is Albert C. Martin &amp; Associates, Los Angeles.

MANKIND POSES GRAVE THREAT TO MADAGASCAR'S UNIQUE FLORA AND FAUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<P>
PERINET, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This island off the East African coast is to today's naturalists what the 
Galapagos Islands off South America were to Charles Darwin, a study in 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is under grave threat 
as man continues to torch the forest to clear the land in what one newspaper 
calls a kind of "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, heading off the destruction of Madagascar's fragile habitat has 
become the premier goal of many international environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
After Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150 million years 
ago, its plants and animals went on their own evolutionary course. 
</P>
<P>
Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird and giant 
lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very, very few 
ancestors," said Dr. Martin Nicoll, a zoologist who represents the World 
Wildlife Fund here. "Madagascar lets you look at the limits of adaptability. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants have to do, 
for example, to live in a desert?" 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to desert. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the 226,658-square mile 
island are found nowhere else: from the lovable lemurs to hundreds of species 
of orchids and more than 350 species of amphibians and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from the Latin word 
for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits. The closest living 
descendants of the common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes, lemurs were 
displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the world. Here they had a chance to survive 
in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an aye-aye. It 
detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its sharp ears and then 
uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that weighs about 15 
pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from treetop to treetop. 
</P>
<P>
The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds emitted by great 
whales, are the main attraction for the small but growing number of tourists 
who visit this small reserve about 60 miles east of the capital of 
Antananarivo. 
</P>
<P>
A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably turns up a 
family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy bear-like faces, bemused 
but not much interested in their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now threaten wildlife and 
the nation's watershed, are late arrivals, coming from Africa and the Malay 
Archipelago only 1,500 years ago. Fourteen species of lemurs have become 
extinct since humans arrived, and ecologists fear that others are in danger of 
joining them. 
</P>
<P>
The island's population has more than doubled since 1950, and now exceeds 11 
million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are felling trees on 70-degree 
slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land is barren, and its forests have been 
reduced by half in the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers to cut trees 
and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops. The savanna is burned 
to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10 million zebu cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"In the West and in the East, not far from the capital, the fires continue to 
burn," said U.S. Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch. "Sometimes you see the smoke 
trapped right here in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The government and environmental organizations are working together now to 
discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the education process is slow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a human problem," Prime Minister Victor Ramahatra said. "We 
must teach people that the natural environment is their principal source of 
wealth." 
</P>
<P>
The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a 1975 socialist 
revolution and now follows the advice of Western donors on economic policy. But 
a U.S. Embassy economic report says no economic reforms will work in the long 
run "without corrective action against Madagascar's single greatest 
self-inflicted problem: the destruction of its environment." 
</P>
<P>
The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed isolation since 
President Didier Ratsiraka came to power in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll says the government has cooperated with environmental groups since the 
end of 1985. "It is our No. 1 conservation priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of the daily newspaper Midi said an average of 3.7 million acres 
of land was being burned each year. Midi, an independent journal, likened the 
burning to "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their displeasure 
with the steady decline in the nation's economy since the revolution. Per 
capita income declined 24% between 1979 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destructive Erosion 
</P>
<P>
The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional cyclones. 
Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The Indian Ocean north of 
the island is red from the red clay soil washed out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is organizing an international effort to halt the degradation, 
which it estimates will cost from $300 million to $400 million over the next 15 
to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups, universities 
and governments are under way. They include efforts to save existing reserves 
and plans to create new reserves or national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll, whose WWF is managing projects covering 10 reserves, said efforts have 
to take into consideration the needs of the people who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"The people don't want to cut down the forest just because it's there," said 
Yale University anthropologist Eleanor Sterling, who is studying the aye-aye. 
"They truly need the wood for firewood or for land for agriculture. Many of 
them understand the problems in the environment and would like to do something 
to help, but they have to feed their children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Accept Change 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can be persuaded 
to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there in 1985, during my first long-term stay in Madagascar," he said. 
"When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet people walking along with an ax. 
Just about every day you'd hear the chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that 
now. Tourism has done that. Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected 
status. Nobody would dare go in there now with an ax." 
</P>
<P>
Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only brings a few 
thousand people to the island, many of them bird watchers or naturalists.

MUSEUM ALLOWS PEEK AT BANK OF ENGLAND

<P>
The Bank of England, which has in the past guarded its secrecy as jealously as 
its gold reserves, is allowing the public a glimpse of life behind its stone 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
A newly opened Bank of England Museum traces the history of the bank since its 
foundation in 1694. 
</P>
<P>
Before the museum opened, passers-by could hope for a peep inside only when the 
bank's pink-jacketed gatekeepers opened the giant bronze doors on Threadneedle 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight-Foot Thick Wall 
</P>
<P>
A wall eight feet thick surrounds the building, allowing no space for windows. 
Designed by architect Sir John Soane, the walled curtain has perpetuated the 
aura of mystery since its completion in 1828. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Big Bang in 1986. The deregulation of London's financial market 
brought modernization and electronics -- and a great demand to know more about 
the bank with the mysterious image. 
</P>
<P>
"People read about the Bank of England doing this or that and intervening in 
the foreign exchange market, but they didn't really know much about it," Peter 
O'Riley, deputy museum manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is housed in the bank building, which visitors enter through a side 
door. 
</P>
<P>
The chronological tour starts at the Bank Stock Office, reconstructed from 
Soane's original design. 
</P>
<P>
The hall contains a display of the architectural history of the bank, which 
began operations in temporary accommodations before moving to a venue known as 
Grocers' Hall. It stayed there for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
A new building on Threadneedle Street was completed in 1734. A few years later, 
Soane, the eccentric architect whose design for his wife's tomb inspired the 
shape of the famous British red telephone booth, rebuilt much of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seven-Story Building 
</P>
<P>
A huge increase in staff during World War I necessitated further expansion. 
Soane's one-story building was replaced with the seven-story building that 
houses the bank, but his original windowless wall remains. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond a statue of King William III, during whose reign the bank was 
established, are scenes depicting the 17th-Century goldsmiths who had a virtual 
monopoly on money lending before the Bank of England was born. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of five goldsmiths when King Charles II reneged on his debts 
highlighted the need for a public bank. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II on Nov. 16, 1988, the 300th 
anniversary of the ascension to the throne of William and his wife Mary in 
1688. 
</P>
<P>
Their reign brought political stability, but war with France depleted the 
national coffers and made setting up a central bank a matter of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
A young Scottish merchant, William Paterson, suggested founding a bank that 
would lend money to the government in return for certain privileges, namely the 
right to issue bank notes. 
</P>
<P>
His book expounding the theory and the founding charter bearing the original 
royal seal are on display today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Subscription 
</P>
<P>
The idea proved popular, and citizens subscribed 1.2 million pounds sterling 
for stock in the institution that was to be called "the Governor and Company of 
the Bank of England." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the bank became known -- not so affectionately at first -- as "the Old 
Lady of Threadneedle Street," a nickname that has stuck. 
</P>
<P>
In 1797, war with France forced a restriction on cash payments. Notes could no 
longer be freely converted to gold, and low-denomination notes were issued for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, a playwright and member of Parliament, called the 
bank "an elderly lady in the city of great credit and long standing who had 
ultimately fallen into bad company." 
</P>
<P>
Cartoonist James Gillray took up the image, depicting the bank as a spinster 
clothed in pound notes and receiving unwanted attentions from the prime 
minister. The original caricature hangs in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Sir John Houblon, a wealthy merchant, was the first governor. The dusty pink 
worn by the bank's gatekeepers is thought to be the color of his household 
livery. 
</P>
<P>
Every Thursday, when the Court of Directors meets in the elegant chambers of 
the bank, the gatekeepers don red capes and coned hats and carry black bamboo 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The bank was nationalized after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Bank Notes Displayed 
</P>
<P>
The earliest bank notes, some yellowed with age but still legible, are in the 
museum. Early forgeries are also on display. 
</P>
<P>
A main attraction in the museum is a display of gold bars stacked beneath a 
glass pyramid. But their sparkle is deceptive -- the 59 pieces of bullion are 
facsimiles. The real thing is kept under lock and key in an underground vault. 
</P>
<P>
Only two bars of gold, each weighing 28 pounds, are shown to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has its own security force, but employees will not discuss security. 
Nor will they say how much gold is stored within the bank's impenetrable walls, 
but it is believed to be one of the world's biggest reserves.

TINY TELESCOPIC DEVICE PUTS LEGALLY BLIND DRIVERS ON ROAD IN INDIANA 
</P>

"I'm going to get a motor car. I'm going to learn how to drive," said Bruce 
Quinn, who is 32 and legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who by next summer expects to be running two radio stations 50 miles 
apart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the first time, thanks 
to eyeglasses equipped with small telescopes for making out details such as 
road signs and stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I've had a lot of fun 
with it and never any trouble, so I should be all right," Quinn, of Delphi, 
said. "It offers me a lot of opportunities -- something called freedom. Goodby 
to Greyhound. A lot of handicapped people are stuck on Greyhound." 
</P>
<P>
California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more than 10 
years, and about 25 states have such programs for as many as 2,000 drivers 
nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles director of 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown developed Indiana's bioptic registration program at the urging of a 
vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help from low-vision optometrists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic State Help 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was the greatest idea in the world when I heard it. It's nice to 
do a little good for someone," he said. "You wouldn't believe how sad it is to 
tell a man he cannot drive again. I've had men cry. Driving is probably the 
single most important thing in any man's life." 
</P>
<P>
Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensing guidelines, said 
not everyone fits the program. Getting a license to drive is "a major step 
toward independence," but "it's not something that I push," he said. "Driving 
is a great privilege, but it's also a great responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, drivers must have vision correctable to 20-200 with glasses and to 
20-40 through telescopes with up to 4X magnification, a horizontal visual field 
of 130 degrees and no major blind spots, color-perception defects or other 
visual problems. They must be evaluated and fitted for the telescopes, get a 
six-month learner's permit and pass special state-sponsored training as well as 
the usual road test. 
</P>
<P>
The telescopes cost from $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size and 
weight, but the most commonly used ones are about one inch in diameter and 
weigh about 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angle upward 
from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, in some cases both 
eyes. When the driver needs to see something he tilts his head forward to peer 
through the scope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driving Range Limited 
</P>
<P>
"Most bioptic drivers, especially the older ones, tend to drive only in 
familiar areas," optometrist Dr. Debra McConnaha of Indiana University said. 
"It's possible they might be able to drive to the grocery and back without 
using the telescope. It's there if they need it." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the program say a bioptic driver must be able to glance through 
the telescope and spot something in less than a second -- about as quickly as a 
normal driver might glance into the rear-view mirror -- but critics say this is 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N. J., ophthalmologist who's been prescribing 
bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need at least three seconds to 
adjust their focus to the telescope, spot the detail and then readjust to 
looking through their glasses. He said the telescope creates a blind spot that 
is twice as wide as the field of vision through it. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test. There's no evidence 
this device is safe, and there is overwhelming evidence it is a hazard," Fonda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at the University of 
Louisville Medical School, said the telescope makes objects appear to be closer 
than they are and that its "awning effect" obscures overhead signs. He and 
Fonda say that poor-vision people should be allowed to drive, but under 
restrictive conditions such as under 35 m.p.h. only and never on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telescopes Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of ways to help people without encumbering them with an optical 
device that imposes limitations," Keeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gengler of the California Department of Motor Vehicles said that a 1983 
study of the state's bioptic drivers found that they were nearly twice as 
likely to have accidents as others. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident rate was higher, but not significantly. In fact, it was lower 
than rates for a variety of other types of California licensed drivers with 
different medical conditions," Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for bioptic drivers say they are among the most careful people on the 
road. Bioptics say they know their limitations and won't exceed them. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress the safe-driving aspect as part of the privileges we get as 
drivers," said Marc Sessions, president of the 1,000-member American Bioptic 
Certified Drivers, based in Laguna Niguel, Calif. (He said the group's 
initials, ABCD, also stand for Always Be Careful Driving.) 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Canada, 34, of Jasonville, started driving at 16 but lost her license 
eight years ago because of poor eyesight. "I have to be more careful than 
others. If I feel I am not capable, I am not going to be on the roads," said 
Canada, driving through downtown Indianapolis after her road test in October. 
</P>
<P>
Until she got a bioptic license, Canada had to call her husband at work if an 
emergency came up at home with any of their four children. "It's been eight 
years since I've been able to drive, so I've been in a kind of a prison."

East Germany will greatly increase its nuclear power capacity over the next 
decade, an official East Berlin newspaper said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Berliner Zeitung said the government was aiming for a capacity of between 
6,000 and 7,000 megawatts by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Five of eight planned 400-megawatt reactors were on line in the northern city 
of Greifswald, with a 1,000-megawatt unit due to open this year, it said. 
</P>
<P>
An unspecified number were operating in the central towns of Stendal and 
Rheinsberg. 
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of East Germany's electricity is derived from nuclear power.

GREAT OUTDOORS IN THE BIG CITY;

<P>
RANGERS TEACH ABOUT URBAN WILDLIFE

<P>
With the roar of cars from Interstate 87 behind him, Richard DeSimone had 25 
city sixth-graders bend over to look in the mud for traffic of a quieter kind. 
</P>
<P>
"A muskrat's been here," he told them, pointing out a paw print with a line 
through it, evidence of a muskrat dragging its tail. DeSimone then showed them 
footprints made by a raccoon. The children jockeyed for views. 
</P>
<P>
In Van Cortlandt Park, an oasis in the Bronx that has been home to animals 
ranging from snapping turtles to two white-tailed deer spotted last year, 
DeSimone taught the children to be nature detectives and park stewards. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of New York City's 68 urban park rangers, a group of good-will 
ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of city dwellers about the 
nature around them. 
</P>
<P>
The program in the nation's largest city, now in its 10th year, has become a 
model. Park ranger programs have started in about 15 cities, including Seattle, 
Philadelphia, Boston and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"Park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in any park," said Mary 
Kimmitt, deputy director of the Philadelphia Ranger Corps, which started a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the presence of rangers helps keep down the crime rate. In New 
York's Central Park, for instance, the number of felonies dropped 28% in the 
last four years; robberies fell 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get people back in the parks," said Therese Braddick, director 
of New York's urban rangers. "Some people believe they're not safe, and at 
night many areas aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Still, while law enforcement in New York's parks is handled by police and a 
180-member park patrol squad, Braddick said, "We provide a sense of security 
for people." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, rangers show New Yorkers that their back yard is not all concrete. 
Last year, 84,000 people attended 2,618 educational programs held by the 
rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Manhattan, the picture of beautiful park land doesn't come 
to mind," Braddick said. 
</P>
<P>
And yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26,000 acres of parks. 
</P>
<P>
There are 30 species of ducks, 10 species of owls, 15 types of hawks and 
falcons, red foxes, snapping turtles, raccoons, skunks and, occasionally, deer 
from Westchester County to the north. The areas have about 30 types of 
endangered plants, including the winged monkey flower. 
</P>
<P>
New York's first park, Bowling Green, was created in 1733. The city set aside 
land for Central Park in the mid-1850s, created the Department of Parks in 1870 
and during commissioner Robert Moses' tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park 
acreage. 
</P>
<P>
There is little left to put aside now. "The city has filled its borders," said 
park historian Jonathan Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
One place Braddick loves to visit is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with its 
salt marsh, mud flats, 13 miles of rocky shoreline and 520 acres of forest. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Barrocales, 33, fished in Brooklyn's Prospect Park when he was a boy. 
Now he is a park ranger stationed there. One of his jobs is to lead hawk 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
On a crisp morning recently, he passed around binoculars on a second story 
terrace in Prospect Park's boathouse. He told the dozen people who came by that 
New York was a choice location to see hawks as it is on their fly path from 
Canada to warmer spots. 
</P>
<P>
In an hour, five birds of prey were sighted, including the rare peregrine 
falcon. The falcon took its time in passing. Barrocales, normally talkative, 
barely said a word as he watched. 
</P>
<P>
The children from P.S. 122 who visited Van Cortlandt Park also were impressed 
by the wildlife around them. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to DeSimone's message that they should take care of the parks 
-- underscored as he picked up a plastic six-pack holder and broke its rings, 
which can strangle ducks -- 11 year-old Lanette Romero said she had learned a 
lesson: 
</P>
<P>
"You should keep your eyes open, make sure you don't harm animals and look for 
clues like footprints."

6 VACATIONERS HEAD FOR SLOPES -- AT SOUTH POLE

<P>
It may not be everyone's idea of the perfect vacation, but six hardy souls have 
coughed up $100,000 to spend the holiday season skiing at the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
The travel firm in this British Columbian city that organized the trip says 
that for their money the six tourists got a tree and trimmings on Christmas 
Day, 24 hours of sunlight daily and a place in history. 
</P>
<P>
Adventure Network International Inc. describes the trip as the "ultimate 
adventure" and one that will give the participants exclusive bragging rights 
about their seven-week Antarctic summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of a Kind Deal 
</P>
<P>
"It's a one-off deal, it's certainly the only time that we'll offer the trip," 
said Adventure Network general manager Hugh Culver who helped organize the 
50-day trek on behalf of Mountain Travel, a San Francisco area travel firm. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, it's the most expensive adventure travel trip ever sold." 
</P>
<P>
Culver said the six tourists, two of them women, include a 24-year-old Harvard 
divinity student, a 56-year-old Michigan realtor and a 46-year-old Indian Army 
colonel. 
</P>
<P>
They are being guided along the 740-mile route -- in temperatures that can dip 
to minus 40 degrees, with winds of up to 40 knots -- by a five-man team of 
polar experts. 
</P>
<P>
After flying from the south coast of Chile on Nov. 25, the 11 left Antarctica's 
north coast on Nov. 27 and are expected to reach the pole as scheduled on Jan. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner in a Tent 
</P>
<P>
Culver told reporters that the tourists would spend the holidays on the polar 
ice-cap and dine in a specially-constructed, 21-foot-long tent that could be 
erected in three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real over-achievers, they're very aggressive people, but at home they 
lead quiet lives," he said of the adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
Culver said the six are being charged $70,000 for the South Pole trek itself. 
Earlier this year, they each had to take two, weeklong training sessions in the 
Yukon and in Washington State, at a cost of $30,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it such an expensive vacation? 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with unbelievable costs and huge uncertainties," Culver said. 
"When you are flying down there, you never know what your costs are going to be 
because of weather conditions. A flight that normally takes us 18 hours to do, 
may take seven days."

JAIL TIME, FINES SOUGHT FOR REPORTERS ACCUSED OF DEFYING JUDGE'S GAG ORDER

Prosecutors said they will seek fines and jail time for two Chicago Tribune 
reporters accused of defying a judge's gag order in publishing the name of a 
boy accused of stabbing three classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Robert E. Byrne, who issued the gag order, declined to drop 
contempt of court charges against reporters Joseph Sjostrom and Jan Crawford 
during a hearing last week but said he would give the case to another judge. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant state's Atty. Carmen Polo said he would seek fines and jail sentences 
if the two are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne had ordered news media not to identify the 14-year-old charged in the 
stabbings at a high school Dec. 7. The Tribune had published the teen's name 
before the judge issued the order and published it again the day after the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the reporters had obtained the boy's name after interviewing 
his mother and students at the school in Elmhurst. 
</P>
<P>
"Truthful information in the public domain can't be made secret again by an 
order," said Joseph P. Thornton, an attorney for the newspaper.

-- Wallachian, Transylvanian, Turkish and French -- have been bulldozed since 
1980 to make way for a city center hailed by Ceausescu as more appropriate for 
a modern communist society. 
</P>
<P>
It includes the massive 17-story House of the Republic, which will house the 
Communist Party and the government, the 1.8-mile-long Boulevard of the Victory 
of Socialism, and the main ministries. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a congress hall seating 12,000 people, with a dome that will 
dwarf St. Peter's in the Vatican, a national library, museum, opera house and 
cultural center, exhibition hall and theaters, as well as apartments for 
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
As described by Romanian officials, the project is providing much-needed 
cultural and administrative facilities left out of earlier modernization 
schemes that concentrated on improving infrastructure and building new housing 
for an exploding population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalin-Era Type Project 
</P>
<P>
Critics, mainly from abroad, see it as a grandiose, Stalin-era type project 
promoted by Ceausescu and being rushed to completion in time to mark his 25 
years in power in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats noted that the mammoth scheme, employing tens of thousands of 
workers and huge resources, is being pushed ahead at a time when the Romanian 
people are suffering chronic food and power shortages for the fifth year 
running. 
</P>
<P>
Western critics have also charged that many historic buildings, including 19 
churches, a Sephardic synagogue and one of the largest monasteries in southeast 
Europe, were demolished to make way for the new center. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Bucharest architect Constantin Jugurica denied that any valuable 
buildings had been destroyed, and noted that several churches had been moved, 
in a process developed in Romania, to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
He said the churches destroyed were either of little historical or 
architectural interest, or had been badly damaged in the devastating 1977 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occupied by Foreigners 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its geographical position, Bucharest was constantly being occupied 
and destroyed by other nations throughout its history," he said in an 
interview. "Because of this uncertainty, people didn't build houses very 
solidly." 
</P>
<P>
The claim that nothing valuable was destroyed is widely disputed. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few open criticisms voiced in Romania, where a large and 
efficient secret police force crushes all dissent, former Foreign Minister and 
Writers' Union Chairman George Macovescu bemoaned the destruction of one of the 
city's oldest inns in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yellow Inn had its own history and legend, and did not deserve to perish 
under the bulldozers of the new times," he wrote in the union's almanac. 
</P>
<P>
"For we ought not to flatten out with the bulldozer any trace of the past, the 
more so since the adversities of our history have already destroyed too much. 
The present and the future need the testimony of bygone years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's Hope 
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when shown the new project during a visit 
to Bucharest last year, expressed the hope that historical architecture would 
be preserved, adding: "We failed to do this in some places in Moscow, and now 
we are regretting it." 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the old center forced tens of thousands of people to give up 
their homes and move to drab modern apartment blocks in one of three new towns 
ringing the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats, many of the former residents were given only 24 
hours to pack up and vacate their homes before the bulldozers moved in. Many 
others were forced to sign statements saying they had moved voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Jugurica said many people had welcomed the destruction of homes without running 
water and other conveniences. Others wanted to move because they feared another 
earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the scheme see the destruction of privately-owned homes in the 
old city as also fitting in with a "grand design" by Ceausescu to stamp out 
what he regards as remnants of bourgeois life and create a "new socialist man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Controversial Scheme 
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, Ceausescu has launched another controversial scheme to 
drastically reduce the number of villages and relocate the inhabitants in 
apartment blocks in new towns. 
</P>
<P>
"Planning as a means of social control is not new, but in Bucharest it can be 
seen at its most extreme," leading British architecture critic Colin Amery 
wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
American conservationist Janet Heller, writing in the New York Times, said: "By 
turning owners into tenants, Mr. Ceausescu hopes to create a new citizen who 
thinks in collective terms according to socialist principles."

Philippine troops backed by helicopter gunships stormed a military garrison 
held by dissident police officers, ending a three-day standoff that left 16 
dead, including the garrison commander and his chief of staff, both of whom had 
been taken hostage. Military officials said they believed all the dissidents 
were killed when troops attacked the Philippine Constabulary regional 
headquarters in Zamboanga, about 500 miles south of Manila. The garrison was 
seized by eight police officers who had been fired and ordered held in 
connection with a murder investigation. They were later joined by a handful of 
armed supporters.

U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iranian Revolutionary Guards aided by Libyan 
agents planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 
21, killing 270 people, a London newspaper reported. The Sunday Telegraph 
quoted unidentified intelligence officials in Washington as saying hard 
evidence is emerging to show that Iranians blew up the Boeing 747 partly in 
reprisal for the shooting down of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. cruiser 
Vincennes in the Persian Gulf last summer. It said U.S. officials suspect 
Libyans acted as a conduit for the explosives and provided intelligence for the 
Iranian team.

Police arrested anti-abortion activists in Worcester, Mass., and Wichita, Kan. 
In Worcester, 92 abortion protesters who blocked doorways and jammed elevators 
at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts clinic were charged with 
trespassing and released on their own recognizance, officials said. Another 50 
to 75 protesters, also members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, 
picketed peacefully outside the building, police said. The clinic opened three 
hours late, and all but one of 15 patients who had abortion appointments in the 
morning went ahead with the procedure, rather than reschedule, clinic officials 
said in Wichita, 55 adults and three juveniles were charged with loitering by 
blocking the entrance to the Womens Health Care Services clinic and refusing to 
let a doctor drive through the gate, police said.

D.C. JUDGE ORDERS MORE HOMELESS BEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 homeless people stood in the courtroom and applauded for a full 
minute when District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Harriett Taylor ordered 
the city of Washington to provide an additional 620 beds for the homeless, 
saying the district's existing shelter policy for an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 
people is "inadequate and inept." The ruling was the result of a class action 
lawsuit filed by Community for Creative Non-Violence that charged the city has 
not provided adequate shelter for its homeless as required under the 1984 D.C. 
Right to Shelter Act, a ballot initiative passed by city voters. The suit cited 
crowding and poor conditions at shelters and charged people were turned away 
from cramped facilities only to lose fingers or toes to frostbite after 
sleeping on the street.

Detroit Catholics apparently received mixed blessings as the city's archdiocese 
began announcing which inner-city parishes would stay open and which would 
close. At least a dozen parishes will close by summer, 18 have been designated 
as "questionably viable" and were given six months to a year for more study, 
three targeted for closing will be kept open, two will be merged with other 
churches and two will remain open until their pastors retire. Nearly two dozen 
other parishes that did not have Saturday Masses were to learn their fates 
today. Cardinal Edmund Szoka disclosed his final decisions to pastors in 
private meetings last week, giving them permission to release the information 
during weekend services. The church closing plan, announced in September, 
called for closing or merging 48 parishes. Officials cited declining 
membership, a shortage of priests and increasing costs.

Forty-eight inmates in a San Jose jail locked themselves back in their cells 
after the lone correctional officer passed out because of a suspected virus. 
The prisoners then used an emergency phone to call for someone to help her. The 
men were rewarded with ice cream at their next meal for following correct 
emergency procedure, shown during a jail orientation film, according to Jail 
Cmdr. Bob Conroy.

Sikh militants, who pledged to avenge the execution of two Sikhs in the 
assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, killed 14 Hindus 
in two attacks in the northern state of Punjab. Gunmen shot dead 10 farmhands 
in one attack and killed four workers at a brick kiln in the second attack. A 
note left at one of the sites said it was the first revenge for the deaths of 
Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were hanged Friday for their roles in the 
1984 killing of Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.

Cambodians marked the 10th anniversary of the end of brutal Khmer Rouge rule, 
and the head of the Vietnamese-supported government in Phnom Penh said there 
will be no going back. The Cambodian revolution "is absolutely irreversible," 
President Heng Samrin said in a speech. More than a million Cambodians died 
during the 1975-78 Khmer Rouge rule that ended with a Vietnamese invasion in 
late 1978 and installation of a new regime in Cambodia on Jan. 7, 1979. Vietnam 
has promised to withdraw its troops by 1990, and Cambodian officials announced 
last week that the troops would leave by next September if a political 
settlement is reached.

Billy Tubbs, the University of Oklahoma basketball coach, has gone on record 
saying he wanted his Sooners to be the first team to score 90 points in a 
single half of a college basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Billy, but Paul Westhead and Loyola Marymount beat you to it. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions rolled up 93 points by halftime and didn't stop there. LMU had found 
the perfect foil for its fast-paced brand of basketball in U.S. International 
and scored a 162-144 victory Saturday night at Golden Hall. Records were also 
set for most points by two teams and the most points by a losing team in a 
regulation game. 
</P>
<P>
The 93 first-half points broke the record of 87 set by Tubbs' Sooners against 
Oral Roberts this season. The combined 306 points broke the previous record of 
302 set by LMU and Azusa Pacific this season, and the Gulls' 144 points easily 
surpassed the 127 that Pepperdine scored in a loss to LMU last February. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people might be impressed with that kind of scoring orgy, but not 
Westhead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really get into that stuff much," Westhead said. "I get into it this 
much: I want to see the team play the perfect game, see the team run a perfect 
break every time. Then we would be up around 240. One hundred and sixty is kind 
of dabbling in mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
USIU Coach Gary Zarecky didn't find anything mediocre about the game, except 
perhaps in the way the Gulls (6-10) played. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see that video, I'm going to toss and turn because of what might have 
been," Zarecky said. "We played terrible. I'm disappointed in our athletes, 
frankly. We choked, to be honest. We practiced for Loyola Marymount. We've 
played them before. We missed layups, slams, free throws, uncontested -- and I 
underline -- uncontested shots. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a great game, I think, for our program. It was a positive thing 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
But was it fun? 
</P>
<P>
"You better believe it," Zarecky said. "But you want to be on the other end. 
It's not as much fun on this end." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Hank Gathers led all scorers with 40 points and 23 rebounds, and Jeff 
Fryer added 30. Gary Williams had 40 points and 13 rebounds and Demetrius 
Laffitte added 34 points and 16 rebounds for USIU. 
</P>
<P>
USIU and Loyola (6-5) went toe-to-toe for the first 6:23, and then USIU scored 
just 4 points in a span of 4:36. And in a game such as Saturday's, that's much 
too long a drought. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions scored 20 in the span and led, 47-31, with 9:17 remaining in the 
half. USIU cut it to 52-39, but the Lions again went on a tear, scoring 14 
consecutive points for a 66-39 lead with 6:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Simmons, who had a career-high 38 points, tied the one-half record on a 
drive over two USIU players at 1:31 and then broke it an 18-foot shot at 1:12. 
Simmons extended the record with another drive with 35 seconds remaining, and 
Gathers closed the book with drive to the left side with 14 seconds left. LMU 
led, 93-68, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls went to a zone defense in the second half and nearly got themselves 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
With LMU leading, 109-80, with 17:24 remaining, USIU scored 12 consecutive 
points and trailed, 109-92. USIU pulled within 113-97 as Tim Moore scored on a 
drive to the basket and made the free throw after he was fouled by Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lions then put any USIU comeback attempt away with a 27-8 run that gave 
LMU a 140-105 lead with 7:58 to go. 
</P>
<P>
LMU had a chance to break the record of most points in a game by a team, which 
it shares with Nevada Las Vegas. The Lions beat Azusa Pacific, 164-138, this 
season. UNLV defeated Hawaii-Hilo, 164-111, in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer made a free throw to give the Lions a 161-132 lead with 1:44 remaining, 
but LMU managed just one free throw as the bench played the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola will get another chance though. The two teams play again in Los Angeles 
Jan. 31.

AZTECS IMPROVE TO 2-0 IN WAC, BEAT AIR FORCE

A good shot, a basketball sage once said, is one that goes in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
To find the proof, one needed to look no further than the reactions of Tony 
Ross and Raymond Dudley after San Diego State scored a 64-61 comeback victory 
in front of 4,951 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Dudley are two of the Western Athletic Conference's best 3-point 
shooters. And Saturday night, they faced off in a shooter's match. 
</P>
<P>
Both took their wild shots, their ill-advised shots, their 
farther-than-the-eye-can-see shots. And in the end, both took their team's most 
important shot. 
</P>
<P>
From the final score, the rest is easy to guess. Ross swished his final 
3-pointer of the night -- a 23-footer at the top of the key, just beyond the 
NBA line, with 54 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was off," Ross said, "but it found its way through the hoop. . . 
. I really didn't know where I was, I just shot." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-pointer was the last of Ross' team-high 20 points and gave the Aztecs the 
lead for good at 61-59. 
</P>
<P>
The ball and the game then passed to Dudley's hands. But his off-balanced, 
3-point try with 28 seconds left failed, and SDSU center Mitch McMullen 
rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs added three free throws -- including the winning 1-and-1 by Bryan 
Williams with 16 seconds remaining -- for their final points. Senior forward 
Chad Kimble scored Air Force's last basket on a layin with six seconds left 
after Dudley missed another 3-pointer seconds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Aztecs fourth in their past five games and raised their 
record to 8-4, 2-0 in the WAC. It is their best 12-game start since the 1984-85 
team opened at 10-2 and 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was Air Force's third loss in a row after an 8-2 start and their second in 
two WAC games. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley's two late misses overshadowed a 17-point second half in which he made 7 
of 10 shots to rally the Falcons from an early 9-point deficit. He finished 
with a game-high 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
But he could not get over his next-to-last 3-point attempt, which came while he 
was closely guarded by Williams and with 23 seconds left on the 45-second 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I look back on it, it was a bad shot," Dudley said. "I shouldn't have 
taken it. He was hanging on me. I don't know; I just felt I could make it. It 
hurt us. It cost us the game." 
</P>
<P>
The miss ended what had been a game-long shooting matchup between Ross and 
Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
"When he starts making his shots, I felt I could do the same," Ross said. "That 
does get me fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Ross made 6 of 12 shots, including 5 of 11 from 3-point range. He also played a 
season-high 31 minutes after being brought off the bench early to give the 
listless Aztecs a boost. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs began as if they, not the Falcons, were they ones who had lost in 
double-overtime at Hawaii two nights before and then spent most of the next day 
traveling to San Diego. The Aztecs turned the ball over twice and missed their 
first three shots as Air Force took a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The early play had SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg so distressed that he called his 
earliest timeout of the season, just 1:34 into the game, in an effort to shake 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen broke the scoreless streak with a layin at 17:13, but the Falcons 
continued to confound the Aztecs, taking a 20-9 lead at 10:31. 
</P>
<P>
Then, finally, the Aztecs woke up, thanks to insertion of forward Sam Johnson 
and the shooting of Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who missed starting for the first time because of a sprained left 
ankle, entered the game at 10:50. By the time he left with 1:01 left in the 
half, the Aztecs had taken a 34-29 lead on the way to a 36-29 halftime edge. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had seven of his eight points in the half and was perfect on his three 
shots from the field and one free-throw attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"Word came down the bench that maybe he could contribute some," Brandenburg 
said. "If we looked like handle them, he would not have stepped on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Dudley had only seven points at the half. He missed 7 of 8 shots from the 
field, including 4 of 5 3-pointers as he was hounded mainly by the man-to-man 
defense of Williams. But Dudley would not be kept silent for long. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the second half with a scoring burst worthy of his conference-leading 
26.8-point average. He scored 9 points in the first 5:05 of the second as the 
Falcons stormed back to take a 44-43 lead. It was their first lead since a 
26-24 edge with 4 minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The rally came with McMullen and guard Michael Best on the bench, nursing four 
personal fouls. Best eventually would foul out with 6:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The game went back and forth the rest of the way, as no team was able to take 
more than a 3-point lead until Williams' made his 1-and-1 with 16 seconds left.

<TEXT>
<P>
A few members of the San Diego High School boys' basketball team wandered into 
the gym after practice to check out a girls' game between San Diego and Point 
Loma. It's halftime, but the only reason the teams will play two more quarters 
is that the rule book requires it. Point Loma has put this game away early. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the score is it?" says one player, pointing to the scoreboard that 
reads Point Loma 44, San Diego 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Yup," says another. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of a score is that?" asks a nearby spectator. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is easy. It's the kind teams get used to when they play Point Loma 
(15-1), the class of the City Eastern League and the team to beat in San Diego 
County. Vista of the Palomar League ranks close behind, but Point Loma scored a 
54-44 knockout victory over the Panthers (12-2) in a spirited battle that 
featured Point Loma's slick point guard, Monica Filer, and Vista's 6-feet 
4-inch center, Chris Enger. 
</P>
<P>
Filer -- or, as the back of her warmup jacket reads, "Lady Ice" -- is a little 
girl (5-6) with big stats and was a preseason All-American in Street and Smith 
magazine. Filer swerves around defenses, flips no-look passes to teammates, 
breaks into a smile with equal speed after the ensuing layup and is just a 
general pain-in-the-zone for opponents. She has been for four seasons, three as 
a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Enger, named to USA Today's Super 25 team, is appropriately dominant inside in 
scoring (27.3 points per game) and rebounding (11.8). The county's players look 
up to her, literally and figuratively. Her shots get blocked about as often as 
people get real butter on popcorn at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other teams in the county, Santana is good. Poway and Patrick Henry 
are having nice seasons. But the difference is that Santana, Poway and Patrick 
Henry don't have Enger or Filer. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, as far as experience and overall talent, (Vista and Point Loma) 
probably have the best teams," Vista Coach Joe DeMaria said. "(Enger and Filer) 
are the two reasons why our teams are as good as they are." 
</P>
<P>
Filer averages 23.3 points, but her true joy is passing. Fancy. She learns her 
stuff going to the gym and playing with the guys. She got used to being a 
passer rather than a shooter when she played with Terri Mann, an All-American 
who led the Pointers to four consecutive state titles from 1984-87. Mann didn't 
have trouble handling Filer's rocket passes, and Filer didn't hesitate to try 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Terri and I would go to the gym and play ball, and a guy would do a nice move 
and I'd say 'Hey, Terri. I'm going to try that next time we play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Enger doesn't need to fool around. Those nice, short turnaround shots will do 
just fine. When given the opportunity, why not take the easy way? No need to 
shoot from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to take 6- or 7-foot bank shots," DeMaria said. "Sometimes 
it's too easy." 
</P>
<P>
So it seems. Vista and Point Loma have won a few games by lopsided scores this 
season. Vista clubbed San Dieguito Tuesday, 62-20. The final score of Point 
Loma's victory over San Diego Wednesday was 73-29. And therein lies the 
problem. The girls want to play hard, but if they run up ridiculous scores, 
people complain. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its full-court press, Point Loma hears a lot more complaints than 
Vista. Pointer Coach Lee Trepanier received an anonymous letter from an angry 
parent after his team routed Mt. Miguel, 97-10, this season. Trepanier figures 
he knows his business better than parents and fans, so he doesn't usually pay 
much attention to negative mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not changing my style of coaching for anybody," Trepanier said. "I think I 
know a little bit about the game. I (don't have to) explain to parents how to 
run (the team)." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Miguel Coach Sue Stinchcomb doesn't expect explanations, but she doesn't 
necessarily approve, either. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ruthless," she said. "It bothers me, but I can't blame Point Loma for 
doing it. It's not something I would do." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma proved vincible last season when it was knocked out of the playoffs 
by Mount Carmel in the semifinals and was thus dethroned after four consecutive 
CIF section and state titles. This season against Chino, a team with superior 
front-line height, the Pointers lost for the first time at home since 1980. But 
Trepanier has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't play the best," he said, "you never know what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's best have met for the last time this year. Point Loma, a Division 
II school, opted to compete in Division I this year. Because Vista stayed in 
Division II, it won't have a chance for the much-sought rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could beat them," Enger said. "It wouldn't be at their home gym 
where we played them before. I still see Terri Mann there in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Separating Vista and Point Loma for the San Diego playoffs should allow both 
teams to compete at the state tournament, strengthening the representation from 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Santana (10-2) heads the list of other top teams in the county. The Sultans of 
the Grossmont 2-A League are led by two talented forwards: junior Rebecca Aase 
and sophomore Stephanie Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Poway (10-6) probably won't challenge Vista for the Palomar title but has been 
consistent and balanced this season, led by guard/forward Dawn Gigstad (10.1 
points per game), guard Christy Fortney (10) and center Laura Nugent (9.3). 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry (10-4) of the City Eastern League is coasting along behind 
forward/guard Sorri Epps (16-point average) and center Rochelle Johnson (20).

Torrey Pines 59, Morse 56 -- Host Torrey Pines (15-1) was almost caught napping 
by fired-up Morse team but held on to win. Torrey Pines center Kevin Flanagan 
got in early foul trouble, picking up two in the first quarter and another in 
the second. Courtie Miller led Torrey Pines with 24 points; Flanagan had 10. 
Torrey Pines, which never trailed after Kyle Armstrong hit a 3-pointer with 
4:58 in the first quarter, converted just 8 of 19 free throws in the fourth. 
Morse (4-8) was led by Larry Mothershead, who scored 24 points.

THE HERO OF THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THE 46-YEAR-OLD 'BAMBI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KLADY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is was the most successful film of 1988? 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Baby"? "Nightmare on Elm Street IV"? "Bambi"? 
</P>
<P>
You would think "Three Men and a Baby" (from Touchstone, the Disney subsidiary) 
was the highest-grossing film in domestic release, more than $167 million. 
</P>
<P>
But how about the re-re-re-release of "Bambi," Disney's 46-year-old animated 
deer tale? It could easily claim the title, based on its gross of $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Bambi" involved no production cost to Disney. Back in 1942, the then-princely 
sum of $2 million was spent on the film -- but that's been written off long ago 
and the ledger books closed. So, when you place its production cost ($0.00) 
beside its '88 grosses, "Bambi's" ratio for success is frighteningly 
incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men," at a cost of roughly $15 million, works out better than 11-to-1 to 
the good. 
</P>
<P>
While domestic box-office performance in the age of videocassettes, cable and 
foreign exhibition is no longer the determining factor for success, it remains 
a strong indication of profit potential. Certainly, placing production costs 
against box-office gross provides a more apt reflection of profitability than 
literal box-office gross. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be an industry rule of thumb that a film needed to gross three times 
its cost to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Today, no such simple guideline exists. What is undeniable is that very few 
films are profitable based solely upon what they do at North American movie 
theaters. Such factors as foreign box office and videocassette sales -- unknown 
or "gravy" items a decade ago -- are now the primary forces behind many 
productions. The brutal fact is that this year fewer than 30 movies will return 
a profit based upon their domestic box office. 
</P>
<P>
That's 30 among the roughly 120 films released by the majors and several 
hundred others from independents. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analyst Art Murphy claims that the closest approximation he's willing 
to make on a film's profitability is to look at North American rentals (the 
amount returned to the studio after the exhibitor's share) and compare it to 
the production budget, plus print and ad costs. All things being equal, Murphy 
claims that if a film can return 40% of costs from domestic theatrical revenue, 
it's got a good shot at ultimately showing a profit. 
</P>
<P>
When considering the worst performers among 1988, there are a few caveats to 
note. Several entries -- "Distant Thunder," "The House on Carroll Street," 
"Little Nikita," "A Time of Destiny," "The Deceivers," "And God Created Woman" 
and "Sweet Hearts Dance" -- were not nationally released, thereby boosting 
their negative potential. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, when you consider that it can average between $5 million-$7 
million just for prints and ads to open a film across the country, all films 
which grossed less than that amount deserve special recognition. And that's 
gross box office, not what's returned to the distributor, which oftens runs a 
little bit better than 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Or, to take a dark overview, nationally released films have to earn in excess 
of $15 million just to cover the cost of telling an audience a film exists and 
to physically have something to show them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the major product, there's the "specialized" market which, 
though smaller than 5% of the national film-going diet, deserves unique 
mention. 1988 may well be the most lackluster year for alternative and 
foreign-language films in a decade. Despite the fact that a handful of films 
performed well, it was a case of great success for the exceptional and oblivion 
for the overwhelming majority. 
</P>
<P>
All this is, of course, leading to the big picture -- an assessment of the 
relative health of the leading production-distribution companies. The formula 
is an inversion of ice-skating scoring. Rather than throw out the top and 
bottom scores, you retain them. So, in this instance, one takes all entries 
from a company that appear in the top 20, bottom 20 and top 10 specialized 
list. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Disney had six entries in the top 20 and two in the cellar. First, 
one totals the revenue from the eight entries, which comes to $592.4 million. 
Next one divides by the production costs of $128 million and arrives at a 
quotient of 4.63 -- a positive healthy figure but not quite 1988's best. Here's 
how they rate this year: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. New Line Cinema (2 entries), 6.58 
</P>
<P>
2. Paramount Pictures (5), 4.98 
</P>
<P>
3. MGM (3), 4.78 
</P>
<P>
4. Walt Disney (8), 4.63 
</P>
<P>
5. 20th Century-Fox (3), 3.98 
</P>
<P>
6. Orion Pictures (including Classics) (8), 3.71 
</P>
<P>
7. Warner Bros. (4), 2.79 
</P>
<P>
8. Cannon Entertainment (2), 1.52 
</P>
<P>
9. Universal Films (2), 1.37 
</P>
<P>
10. Tri-Star Pictures (4), .40 
</P>
<P>
11. Columbia Pictures (3), .39 
</P>
<P>
12. Vestron Films (2), .21 
</P>
<P>
United Artists, with no entries on the three charts receives an honorary .007 
in 1988 and we're confident with the release of the next James Bond, its 
quotient will increase next year.

CRITIC'S NOTES: A TRIO OF EXCEPTIONAL MOVIE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever their other exceptional qualities, "The Accidental Tourist," "Working 
Girl" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien," three of the holiday's comedies -- or 
semi-comedies or would-be comedies -- have an especially interesting trio of 
women characters. And they are played by actresses whose sheer adorability 
level is phenomenal: Geena Davis, Melanie Griffith and Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
These are actresses who are liked, if that's not too passive a word, by men and 
women equally, already a rare and pleasant phenomenon. Each one plays a gutsy 
outsider -- way, way outside, in the case of Basinger's extra-terrestrial -- 
and each one is resilient and resourceful, exactly as we've come to expect 
contemporary, liberated heroines to be. They are the creations of very 
different writers and directors; a novelist, a playwright/screenwriter and a 
phalanx of comedy writers. Yet the way each woman's character works seems to 
reflect the retrenchment around us more than any liberated successes. These are 
very definitely "vive la difference" ladies; they revel in it, and audiences 
seem to revel right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic outsider, shattering complacency and safe behavior, is hardly 
new; if there are reportedly only a dozen basic plots in the world, that one is 
probably No. 2. We've seen that character in Darryl Hannah's mermaid in 
"Splash," as Melanie Griffith -- again -- in "Something Wild," Michelle 
Pfeiffer in "Married to the Mob," Whoopi Goldberg in "Clara's Heart" or Dustin 
Hoffman in "Rain Man." Such forces aren't always benign; a few years ago, in 
"Smooth Talk," it was Treat Williams' terrifying Arnold Friend. 
</P>
<P>
Such jolting characters are more often men, and men whose characters are more 
richly detailed: Eddie Murphy in "Trading Places," Nick Nolte in "Down and Out 
in Beverly Hills" (and before that, his prototype in "Boudu Saved From 
Drowning," Sidney Poitier in "In the Heat of the Night," and Robin Williams in 
almost everything but especially "Moscow on the Hudson" and "Good Morning, 
Vietnam." "Gandhi" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" are built around exactly 
such obstreperous men. The only newness to this season's model is that now 
these classic shaker-uppers are enormously appealing women. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful actresses with a nice comic bent are invariably called their decade's 
Carole Lombard, but that doesn't hold here. Lombard, even when she was playing 
a hick, was clearly a sophisticate. And she was a feminist before her time. 
Bring her back now and those qualities would only be intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever other remarkable qualities Basinger and especially Davis and 
Griffith's characters possess, they're more earthy than sophisticated. Basinger 
is vastly knowledgeable, of course, but you could never call that gurgling 
giggle the weapon of a sophisticate and no one is going to call any of them 
them feminists. Pungent confrontation is not their style, nor is forging ahead 
on their own. They succeed by acting as catalysts in the lives of their men. 
</P>
<P>
Geena Davis's Muriel Pritchett gently challenges William Hurt's Macon Leary 
back to life, out of his profound mourning for the death of his 12-year-old 
son. Off-center, clearly "unsuitable" but radiantly positive, Muriel is a risk 
taker, drawing Macon to risk a little of himself, in contrast to his wife of 20 
years Sarah (Kathleen Turner), who understands him so completely that he has no 
room left to grow or to surprise himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Celeste, the alien (and the only conceiveable reason to endure this 
strained, charmless "comedy"), Basinger forces Dan Aykroyd's widower scientist 
to greater achievements, almost in spite of himself. He has made a great 
scientific leap inadvertently. Now to save her planet and because she knows the 
basics of his work herself, Basinger inspires him to duplicate his triumph and, 
presumably, to build from it. 
</P>
<P>
With Harrison Ford in tow, Melanie Griffith's Tess McGill impulsively crashes a 
society wedding in order to make a crucial business contact. Her chutzpah makes 
Ford's corporate type cringe, but only until he gets used to the idea. Once the 
ruse is working, he's as inspired at improvisation as she is. 
</P>
<P>
What all three women do is to open doors for these slightly square men, but 
they're in no hurry to bolt through them themselves. That would apparently be 
unseemly, unwomanly aggressiveness. To drive home that point, a large part of 
"Working Girl's" fun comes from watching Sigourney Weaver, as just such a 
woman, get hers. 
</P>
<P>
Does this trio succeed only because they are adorable, gorgeous or cuddly? 
We're not supposed to think so. A lot of screen time and a great deal of ink is 
expended to show just us how smart they are. Basic smarts, dimmed only slightly 
by lack of advantage in at least two cases. 
</P>
<P>
These women are real, or the movies' equivalent of real, which means blue 
collar and struggling. (We except Basinger, whose whole civilization is so far 
above our own that you wonder why she bothers to trifle with any of us, once 
she had what she wanted.) You might take film reality with a grain of salt; as 
a friend remarked acerbically after "Working Girl," "Sure, she succeeds because 
she's so smart; it doesn't hurt that she also looks sensational running around 
in her teddies, either." 
</P>
<P>
We take from movies reflections of life or ways of behaving. Out of this trio 
of love stories, from very different sources and sensibilities, what seems to 
have emerged is a woman who mixes the pure lovability of a '50s Marilyn Monroe 
with contemporary accomplishment and intelligence. She's a strange hybrid, and 
perhaps her success with today's conservative-leaning audiences is that she 
soothes sensibilities ruffled by the strides of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
But you know how potent these images are when you hear, as I did last week, an 
accomplished, extremely successful and beautiful woman say that she studies 
these actresses fascinatedly, to see how the "girly-girls" work. She may learn, 
but I wouldn't count on it working outside of the movies.

... AND A HUMBUG IN A PEAR TREE; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATING SOME OF THE TACKIER THEATRICAL MISDEEDS OF 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly Scrooge lost it. "You can't teach an old dog new tricks," he snarled, 
kicking the stool from under Tiny Tim. "Nephew -- you're out of my will! 
Cratchit, you're fired!" 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge was suffering from Delayed Holiday Stress Syndrome. Readers similarly 
afflicted are in the proper frame of mind to peruse our Humbug Awards, 
celebrating some of the tackier theatrical misdeeds of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Let's start at the top, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. The RSC used to 
concentrate on doing Shakespeare. Now, in order to impress the Thatcher 
administration that it can generate private-sector revenue, it concentrates on 
cutting deals with commercial producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Carrie" was its most cynical project yet, a shlocky American-style musical 
that would try out under the RSC's roof at Stratford and then transfer to 
Broadway. What the RSC didn't realize was that shlock isn't that easy to do. 
"Carrie" was laughed out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"Legs Diamond" got the next-worst Broadway reviews of the year, but its 
producers are not taking it off the boards. That's admirable. A brass Humbug to 
them, all the same, for allowing "Legs" to run from October to December at full 
Broadway prices (a $50 top) while keeping the critics out on the grounds that 
these were "preview" performances. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of brass, the new artistic director of the Cleveland Play House fired 
the theater's core company, began jobbing in New York actors and acquired a 
Broadway press agent -- who presented all this as some sort of victory for 
resident theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Until Ms. X's arrival," said a pitch-letter to theater editors, "the Play 
House was considered a non-professional also-ran." How's that for institutional 
loyalty? 
</P>
<P>
Also speaking of brass, the League of American Theatres and Producers, Inc. 
continues to use that title, while remaining strictly a trade organization for 
the Broadway theater. The group's original and proper title: the League of New 
York Theatres and Producers. 
</P>
<P>
On the patriotic front, Dale Wasserman threatened to sue the Denver Center 
Theatre Company unless it excised the "anti-American propaganda" from its 
production of Wasserman's and Joe Darion's "Man of La Mancha." Peace was 
declared when Don Quixote's windmill was repainted from red, white and blue to 
a neutral color. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Now for the home boys. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Davidson, artistic director of Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum, 
told Calendar that his deepest wish for the Christmas season was that 
"nontraditional casting" would someday become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Putting such things in the realm of "someday" is a good way to ensure that 
they'll never happen. When we came to town in 1969, one theater was committed 
to nontraditional casting: the Inner City Cultural Center. This remains the 
case today. Davidson should take this issue off his wish-list and put it on his 
action-list. 
</P>
<P>
Another Humbug to the cast of "Hurlyburly" for canceling a performance at the 
last minute because their dear friend Gary Busey had just been hurt in a 
motorcycle accident and they were too overwrought to perform. This may or may 
not be the real reason they didn't perform. (We have heard other versions of 
the story.) The point is that they didn't. Grow up, boys and girls. Doing a 
play is not like doing a taping in Burbank. That's not a studio audience out 
there. They paid money. You can't send them home because you've got the vapors. 
</P>
<P>
On a related issue, Center Theatre Group/Ahmanson not only failed to provide a 
sufficiently rehearsed understudy when Frank Langella was taken ill during a 
matinee of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," it refused to refund its patrons' money 
when the understudy was still carrying a script at the evening performance. 
Whatever happened to "The customer is always right"? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Other local Humbugs go to: 
</P>
<P>
UK/LA. Not the sound that followed Langella's sudden dash into the wings, but 
the acronym for a British tourist promotion masquerading as an "arts festival" 
that mostly included shows we were scheduled to get anyway -- and didn't 
deliver on all of them. 
</P>
<P>
"If They Come Back" for the year's most presumptuous come-on: "The Most 
Powerful Play the Stage Has Ever Seen." 
</P>
<P>
"Tamara" for the year's second most presumptuous come-on: "Be Closer to 
Adultery Than You've Ever Been Before." 
</P>
<P>
The press agent who wrote this letter to a Broadway producer: "Dan Sullivan is 
my closest first cousin. This can help immensely when your show comes to Los 
Angeles. Well, maybe Dan isn't a cousin, but after working as a press 
representative in L.A. theater for the past 15 years he feels like one. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get the account. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove city councilman who voted to de-fund the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival because it hadn't done a thing to improve Garden Grove's bum image. We 
hadn't realized, until that moment, that Garden Grove had a bum image. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles artistic director who sought to change the above councilman's 
mind thus: 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that you will reconsider your position on old Will Shakespeare 
who wrote some of those most insightful and devine (sic) works to date. I would 
hope that you would take just a little time to look over some of his speeches 
just to see how they might inspire you and others around you to convey these 
words onto (sic) younger generations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The Equity Waiver producer who demanded a second review for his show on the 
grounds that "the night your reviewer saw it, it was not one of the better 
performances due to inordinately bad weather conditions (high winds/ low 
humidity) which proved to be a strain on the singers' lungs, throats and 
nerves. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Every theater in town, for celebrating Eugene O'Neill's 100th birthday on Oct. 
16 with -- nothing. Not even a birthday cake. Happily, San Francisco's American 
Conservatory Theatre gave O'Neill a bang-up celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Manu Tupou, director, for providing 16 pages of pictures and program notes 
about everyone involved with his showcase production of Dale Wasserman's "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" -- with emphasis on Manu Tupou. But there wasn't a 
word about Wasserman or the author of the original novel, Ken Kesey. 
</P>
<P>
A generic Humbug to readers who won't sign their hate mail -- or, worse, who 
sign phony names and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Adams of Venice wasn't afraid to sign his name. "I hope that you 
soon resolve your emotional conflict with Andrew Lloyd Webber. You Irish are a 
lovable people but your childlike prejudices against the British are too much 
to bear." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Edward Mann of Los Angeles: "No wonder you are a $65 a week clerk at a 
newspaper. No class!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
A final Humbug to this writer for various sins of omission and commission. For 
example, we reported that the man into whose arms playwright David Henry Hwang 
jumped when he ran up to get the Tony award for "M. Butterfly" was his 
producer, David Geffen. Wrong. It was Geffen's co-producer, Stuart Ostrow. 
</P>
<P>
We also confused St. Sebastian and St. Stephen (Sebastian died by arrows, 
Stephen by stones), and we misspelled the name of the great Restoration woman 
playwright Aphra Behn. But we did get the name of her medieval predecessor 
right -- the immortal Hroswitha. 1989 is sure to see further improvements.

'AMERICAN BUFFALO' AT THE GNU THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's three men and a buffalo-head nickel in David Mamet's "American Buffalo" 
(1977), opening Thursday at the Gnu Theatre in North Hollywood. The theater's 
artistic head, Jeff Seymour, is directing. 
</P>
<P>
"What's so wonderful about this play?" Seymour asked rhetorically. "Aside from 
the way Mamet has with (his low-brow, fragmented) dialogue -- which is 
fascinating when it's done right -- the story has to do with friendship, 
loyalty: how we treat our friends." 
</P>
<P>
The plot centers on resale shop-owner Donny (played by Robert Costanzo), who 
plans a burglary with his young gofer Bobby (Dennis Christopher); their plan is 
then discovered by Donny's neurotic friend Teach (Joe Spano) and becomes a 
three-way gambit that takes on explosive dimensions as long-suppressed fears 
and frustrations erupt under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour swears the recent run of all-male plays at the Gnu has come about 
strictly by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do with my last plays was find something for Patti 
D'Arbanville (who appeared in John Patrick Shanley's "Italian American 
Reconciliation" at the Gnu in 1987)," he said. "I set out to do that -- and 
came up with (the very macho) 'El Salvador.' I set out again to find another 
Patti D'Arbanville play -- and found 'American Buffalo.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Seymour has the kind of winner in "Buffalo" that he had in "El Salvador" 
last year, d'Arbanville shouldn't mind waiting another few months. 
</P>
<P>
WAR PLAY: "The title's misleading," said director Deborah LaVine said of Terri 
Wagener's "War Brides," opening Friday at Long Beach's International City 
Theatre. "It has nothing to do with war or brides." The piece, which LaVine 
describes as "lyrical, very lazy, sort of Southern Gothic," focuses on seven 
women in a Montgomery, Ala., boarding house, circa 1917. "It's about what 
happens to these women when the world changes around them. In this case, war is 
the catalyst." 
</P>
<P>
LaVine, who staged last year's critically acclaimed "Distant Fires" at this 
theater, was drawn to the play and the opportunity to work with an all-female 
cast. ("Fires" had been all-male.) She acknowledged that the experience of 
working with women is very different from that of working with men. 
</P>
<P>
"The men instantly created a family, understood what they were after and formed 
relationships," she said. "Women are slower to do that. They've been working in 
their own spheres. Only now are they starting to become a unit. Also, women see 
me as a buddy. For the men, I was more of a nurturer, the mother figure." 
</P>

CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: "Stars in the Morning Sky," Russian playwright Alexander 
Galin's dramatization of the official "sweep" relocating Moscow prostitutes for 
the 1980 Olympic Games, opened recently at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Bill 
Bushnell directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan Sullivan in The Times: "The play connects with the American viewer -- 
both with our current scorn for 'losers' and current concern about the 
homeless. . . . All of this makes Galin's play pertinent intellectually. But it 
is not a riveting experience in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
From the Herald Examiner's Richard Stayton: "Excise the play's sociological 
significance and what remains is a sentimental, heavy-handed, contrived, 
old-fashioned melodrama about fallen women who drink too much, shout too often 
and wallow in self-pity." 
</P>
<P>
In the Daily News, Daryl H. Miller wrote: "Galin's script contains some dark 
humor along with the dark drama, and Bushnell can't seem to decide whether the 
play is a tragedy or a comedy. He milks the comedy, which gives the otherwise 
somber play a strange tone." 
</P>
<P>
Said Drama-Logue's Richard Scaffidi: "Just because a person, idea or script 
makes its way courageously out of the Soviet Union doesn't make it important. 
In fact, 'Stars' suffers from maladies abundant in plays originating locally: 
it is repetitious, self-important, stilted in its dialogue and unimaginative in 
its characterizations." 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Weekly, Bill Raden faulted Bushnell's "banal, curatorial staging," 
adding, "The production's finer points -- Douglas D. Smith's expressive, 
shell-shocked set, Deirdre O'Connell's work as an alcoholic whore -- are 
reduced to yet another look at those poor oppressed people of the U.S.S.R."

L.A. WORKS TO SAVE TROUBLESOME TREES IN WOODLAND HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a switch from what happened the last time tree roots damaged a street in 
Woodland Hills, officials are taking concrete steps to save hundreds of trees 
that have buckled pavement in the community's oldest neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city street maintenance crews are cutting out and replacing damaged 
curbs and gutters -- not cutting down the 65-year-old eucalyptus and pepper 
trees whose roots have caused cracks and buckling on 10 streets. 
</P>
<P>
The streets are in Woodland Hills' original 1923 Giraud subdivision south of 
Ventura Boulevard. The neighborhood is half a mile from where state highway 
workers caused a furor eight months ago by chopping down trees that were 
beginning to crack sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
State workers removed 25 ash trees along Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Warner 
Center Park in May before a public outcry forced them to stop. Department of 
Transportation officials later apologized and told nearby homeowners that the 
trees could be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
But Caltrans administrators continue to back their policy of removing 
troublesome trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cannot Afford Repairs 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent meetings with Woodland Hills residents, state officials -- who 
have jurisdiction over Topanga Canyon Boulevard because it is a state highway 
-- said they cannot afford to make repeated repairs to tree-damaged pavement. 
</P>
<P>
James L. McCullough, the senior Caltrans maintenance engineer who authorized 
the tree removal in May, said other trees along Topanga Canyon Boulevard are 
beginning to damage pavement. He said the state will give adjacent property 
owners a chance to save the trees by assuming responsibility for them before 
Caltrans resorts to the chain saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a dislike for trees that makes us do this," McCullough said. He 
added that Caltrans' limited highway-repair budget precludes spending money on 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
City street maintenance administrators said their policy is different. 
</P>
<P>
"We do whatever we can to save trees," said Bob Kennedy, street tree 
superintendent for the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance. "It's easy to cut 
the tree down and eliminate the problem, but we don't take that posture." 
</P>
<P>
In Woodland Hills, city tree experts have carefully cut away roots that are 
damaging the pavement. Then they have pruned the tallest trees to keep them 
from toppling over because of a lack of root support. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the city in recent years has increased inspections of the 680,000 
trees that line Los Angeles' streets. It has also increased tree trimming in 
hopes of keeping top-heavy trees from blowing over in storms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when the city scheduled pruning of all street trees over a 16-year 
cycle, about 300 trees were uprooted by one storm, Kennedy said Friday. The 
city now tries to trim all trees every six years or so. As a result, only 20 
street trees were lost when a major windstorm struck Los Angeles two months 
ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Weber, street maintenance supervisor in charge of the Woodland Hills 
repair project, said workers are installing new gutters along 2.3 miles of 
roadway bordered by Providencia and Crespi streets and Don Pio and San 
Feliciano drives. 
</P>
<P>
Each curb-side tree in the area is being inspected by city arborists after the 
old gutters, curbing and pavement have been removed and the roots have been 
exposed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two aging eucalyptus trees have been found to have rotted roots that put 
them in danger of falling over after the root system had been trimmed to make 
way for the new paving. After city workers consulted homeowners near the trees, 
officials said, the trees were reluctantly removed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to see trees saved," Weber said Friday. "This place would look kind 
of desolate without them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replacing Curbing 
</P>
<P>
Although new concrete gutters are being installed along all 10 streets, only 
the most seriously damaged curbing -- sections with broken concrete that could 
cause tire blowouts -- is being replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is costing about $440,000, said Neil Spiva, chief projects 
coordinator for the Bureau of Street Maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The work will take another two months to finish. But it has already drawn 
praise from Woodland Hills residents who had decried May's tree-chopping by 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather save the trees than the sidewalks," said Doug McClung, who is one 
of the neighborhood's oldest residents. He built his home on Martinez Street in 
1948, when there were only a few houses in the Giraud subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Giraud's eucalyptus and peppertrees were mature giants even then, McClung said. 
By the '40s, Giraud's original development company had gone broke and the name 
of the entire 4,000-resident community had been changed from Giraud to Woodland 
Hills because of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
McClung said he has teased the city street repair crew that is working in his 
neighborhood by showing them a 1929 photo that depicts nearby Dumetz Road being 
graded by workers using a team of four mules. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, also 
applauded the city's tree-saving efforts. He said the city's street-tree 
maintenance staff has begun to work with homeowners after being involved in a 
tree-pruning controversy a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to say that Mr. Kennedy is less a bureaucrat and more sympathetic 
than most people in the city we deal with," said Murley, who bitterly clashed 
with Caltrans over the Topanga Canyon Boulevard chopping incident. "People are 
finally coming to realize that to denude a neighborhood has no value."

INCUMBENT'S RACE FOR SCHOOL BOARD INCLUDES PLENTY OF BRICKBATS TO DODGE; 
</P>
<P>
KORENSTEIN RUNS A GANTLET OF CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents picketed outside her Northridge home last summer, opponents launched a 
recall campaign in September and critics charge that Los Angeles school board 
member Julie Korenstein can't make up her mind on important decisions. 
</P>
<P>
As the filing deadline approaches for candidates seeking Korenstein's seat in 
the April 12 election, the west San Fernando Valley representative faces the 
challenge of building up her image as an effective board member. 
</P>
<P>
"A scantily clad woman in a combat zone isn't as vulnerable," said one former 
high-ranking district official, who asked not to be named. Korenstein's 
opponents, encouraged by her recent troubles, seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Romey, who lost to Korenstein in a bitter 1987 race, started raising 
money two months ago for a rematch and already has sent former supporters her 
own version of Korenstein's record in office. Two other candidates announced 
intentions to run last month. The filing deadline for the $24,000-a-year office 
is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, 45, said she does not believe her chances for reelection have been 
hurt in past months. For every critic, several others have telephoned to lend 
support, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not been negative at all," Korenstein said in a recent interview. "I 
could have not stimulated more interest in my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Most political observers expect Korenstein to maintain her advantage as 
incumbent over the challengers. But there are several factors contributing to 
her vulnerability, say teachers, board members and administrators: 
</P>
<P>
* Korenstein has served only 18 months in an office that board colleagues say 
takes at least two years to fully learn. Without a four-year term to build a 
constituency, Korenstein's support may be weak, her opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition 73, a voter-approved initiative, will probably block United 
Teachers-Los Angeles from repeating a $70,000 contribution that the union gave 
Korenstein for the last election. That money, the lion's share of the $108,000 
that she raised in her 1987 campaign, was of great help to Korenstein, who 
entered the race as a politically inexperienced and relatively unknown 
Chatsworth High School program administrator. 
</P>
<P>
* Korenstein has angered several groups of constituents by abstaining from a 
key board vote in May that resulted in an increased number of students being 
bused to Valley schools, by being seen as responsible for the transfer of a 
popular junior high school principal and by failing to win the board votes 
necessary to block changes in a district child-care program. Two of those 
issues have drawn potential challengers. 
</P>
<P>
But Korenstein, a divorced parent with three children, said she has done plenty 
to earn the support of voters in her region, which is roughly the part of the 
Valley west of the San Diego Freeway. She won office after defeating Romey in a 
June, 1987, runoff election to fill the two years remaining in the term of 
former board member David Armor, who resigned to take a government job in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her accomplishments have come from her chairmanship of the school 
district's business operations committee. Ironically, a seat on that committee 
was Korenstein's last choice when she took office. "I thought I was being 
punished," she said. "Now I find it fascinating." She later sought 
reappointment to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Program 
</P>
<P>
The business operations committee has overseen the creation last year of a 
surplus-food giveaway program that provides 15 nonprofit agencies each day with 
about 400 leftover meals from 50 schools in the district. "I am most proud of 
this contribution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
District business services administrators say the idea has been around for 
years. Korenstein said that may be true, but that she was the one who pushed 
the program through. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein also takes credit for a districtwide recycling program, due to begin 
this month, that will return the profits from recycled paper to participating 
schools to be used for student activities. The committee she chairs also 
oversees an award-winning energy-conservation program that saved the Los 
Angeles Unified School district nearly $500,000 last year, by reminding 
teachers and administrators to turn off lights and heaters in empty classrooms, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that these things are not monumental issues in other people's eyes," 
said board member Warren Furutani, who also received substantial contributions 
from the teachers' union in the 1987 campaign. "But those are the kind of 
common-sense solutions that Julie has come up with." 
</P>
<P>
Furutani was the most vocal among those on the board in his support of 
Korenstein. Board president and East Valley representative Roberta Weintraub 
gave Korenstein credit for being a hard worker, but said she has not decided 
whether she will endorse her in the April election. Weintraub said she 
supported Romey in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg declined comment on Korenstein's performance, and 
several other board members did not answer messages asking for comments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Support 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism centers on Korenstein's failure to consistently win three 
other board votes needed to approve proposals, such as funding for a popular 
ROTC program at Granada Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, some parents were angered when the district last spring 
decided to limit the number of transfer permits to mostly white schools for 
before- and after-school child care near those schools. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the district said they believed that the transfer policy could be 
abused by parents seeking to segregate their children at 10 mostly white 
schools scattered throughout the district. A group of West Valley parents sued 
the district and was granted a temporary injunction against the limit later in 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
When the issue returned to the seven-member board in the fall, Korenstein 
failed to persuade her colleagues to back her proposal to allow all students 
now holding transfer permits to be exempted from the new limits. 
</P>
<P>
Dauna Packer, one parent who is part of a group still fighting the permit 
limits, said Korenstein's failure to resolve the issue has prompted her to run 
for the office herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that she has an effective voice on the board," said Packer, a 
Woodland Hills mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, say critics, was Korenstein's failure to take a position during a 
board vote in May to lower enrollment at crowded year-round schools. Board 
members had learned before the meeting that the number of students bused to the 
Valley from other parts of Los Angeles might increase by about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Concerned' 
</P>
<P>
"The big stink was that I abstained," Korenstein said. "I was concerned about 
packing in kids like sardines, . . . and bringing in children by bus is 
educationally unsound." 
</P>
<P>
Only about 860 more students ended up being bused because of the board's 
action. But, Korenstein said, if she could do it over, she would vote against 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of parents staged protests in late summer over the transfer of 
Gerald Horowitz, then-principal of Robert Frost Junior High School in Granada 
Hills, to a school in Sun Valley. Horowitz maintained that Korenstein sought 
the transfer to punish him for supporting Romey in the 1987 race. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein denied having anything to do with the transfer. But parents with 
children at the school nonetheless served her with a notice of recall in 
September. The recall campaign was called off three weeks later, but the 
organizers are now backing Horowitz, who last month said he will run against 
Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said his bid for office is not in retaliation for the transfer but 
because "we have an inexperienced and indecisive board member." 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said she is not worried about Horowitz's supporters. "If they were 
that powerful, they would have continued the recall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the threat of recall behind her, Korenstein said she expects to raise and 
spend about $100,000 in her reelection bid. She said that even with the $5,000 
donation limit set by Proposition 73, support from the teachers' union will be 
indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
"To run for the board and not have support of teachers, you don't have a chance 
in hell of winning," Korenstein said. "With their support, you have teachers 
walking precincts, on the telephones. . . . There are 4,000 to 5,000 teachers 
in the West Valley alone." 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein meets once a month with about 20 teachers who she has picked to 
serve on an informal committee to keep her informed about programs and problems 
in West Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
She and Furutani recently broke with other board members and called for 
face-to-face talks to settle the deadlock between the district and union 
negotiators over increases in teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, Wayne Johnson, 
said he is very happy with Korenstein's performance. Meanwhile, Romey said 
Korenstein has been "bought and paid for by the union." 
</P>
<P>
Steeling herself for what will almost certainly be a campaign loaded with that 
kind of accusation, Korenstein said: "It won't stop me from continuing to push 
forward and do what I need to do as a board member."

SCIENTISTS TRYING TO DEVISE A WAY TO TRAP COSMIC DUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DELTHIA RICKS, United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How do you catch something that is moving 10 times faster than a speeding 
bullet, vaporizes upon striking anything and requires a high-powered lens to be 
seen? 
</P>
<P>
The secret, scientists say, is in measuring the speed and direction in which 
these "somethings" are traveling. But when they happen to be cosmic dust -- 
particles that may hold clues about the origin and evolution of the solar 
system -- catching them can pose a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be able to find them," said Joel Williams, who is part of a Los 
Alamos National Laboratory group in New Mexico that is evaluating cosmic dust 
catchers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmic dust, Williams underscored, can be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the dust is valuable for what it may tell of the heavens as 
well as for its possible biological implications, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps bits of dust that have streamed in from the outer reaches of the 
universe can reveal something about the chemistry of deep space. Maybe the dust 
contains precursors to amino acids, the chemical building blocks of proteins 
that make up all living matter on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have hypothesized that asteroids or comets laden with the 
primordial chemicals of life bombarded early Earth, providing the necessary raw 
materials that set the stage for the evolution of plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge at Hand 
</P>
<P>
But the swirling aggregates of interplanetary dust have been well known to 
astronomers for decades. The quest now is how to trap the particles. 
</P>
<P>
Such debris, often part of great bands of dust, is found throughout the solar 
system and scatters light from the rising and setting sun when viewed from 
areas far away from city lights, giving the effect of a soft solar glow that 
expands the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
While scientists believe the dust particles to be among the most abundant 
cosmic materials in the solar system, orbiting in bands between the planets and 
around the sun, they have had difficulty trying to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
"First you have to record their direction and velocity. Then you must stop them 
with minimum damage," Williams said of the cosmic specks, some measuring less 
than one-thousandth of an inch across, that have broken from comets, asteroids 
and even meteors farther away in space. 
</P>
<P>
The cosmic dust sprinkled through Earth's stratosphere, extending up to 30 
miles above the planet's surface, is puzzling scientists who are trying to 
figure out if the dust is a product of asteroids or comets. Studies tentatively 
suggest much of it may have showered down from the speeding Halley's Comet when 
it made its visit to the solar system in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said NASA officials hope one day to have a dust-catching wing aboard 
the proposed space station Freedom, from which collectors might retrieve 
micrometeorites, bits of comet and asteroid remains. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos scientists are envisioning a cosmic dust catcher that would be about 
a foot thick and measure 10 feet by 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
So far, proposals for the unit indicate the catcher would have to remain in 
place for long periods, possibly up to a year at a time, because "hits" from 
cosmic dust would be very rare. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, dust catching materials aboard the station would have to be 
manufactured to provide a cushion for the specks, something akin to "catching a 
ball with a pillow," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
For years scientists believed most interplanetary dust came from comets 
whizzing past the sun, leaving traces of their existence behind. 
</P>
<P>
But a growing body of evidence from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) 
indicates a large proportion of the dust may have emanated not from comets but 
from asteroids. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell University researchers Stanley Dermott and Philip Nicholson reported at 
a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union that bands of dust 
orbiting the sun may have come from two specific families of asteroids. 
</P>
<P>
Dermott and Nicholson conducted a computer simulation of particles orbiting the 
sun and compared their work to data beamed back from IRAS. They concluded that 
dust, which is under both planetary and sunlight influences, emanated from the 
Themis and Eos asteroid families. 
</P>
<P>
An asteroid family forms when two large bodies collide, annihilating themselves 
but leaving behind a smaller group of asteroids in roughly the same orbits. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornell researchers hypothesize current asteroid families developed 
billions of years ago. But because interplanetary dust remains in orbiting 
bands for approximately 10,000 years, bands now under study probably are made 
up of debris that has rained down from the asteroid belt. 
</P>
<P>
Asteroids, also known as planetoids, are the irregularly shaped bodies made up 
of nickel, iron and other materials that are believed to be fragments of 
planets or substances that did not condense into planets eons ago. 
</P>
<P>
They orbit the sun mostly at a point in space between the orbits of Mars and 
Jupiter.

RABTA, Libya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Libyan officials, attempting to disprove U.S. allegations that they are 
building a large chemical weapons factory, took Western reporters to see the 
facility Saturday but succeeded only in increasing suspicions that they had 
something to hide. 
</P>
<P>
These suspicions were magnified when, less than an hour after returning from a 
whirlwind after-dark ride through the factory complex at Rabta, 40 miles 
southwest of Tripoli, the journalists were informed that they were being 
expelled from Libya aboard specially chartered flights to Malta. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities later relented and told the journalists they could remain until 
this morning and leave on regularly scheduled flights to destinations of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise Kadafi Visit 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi urged officials of the incoming 
Bush Administration in Washington to hold direct talks with his government. 
Making a surprise visit to Tripoli's waterfront Al Kabir Hotel where reporters 
were staying, Kadafi said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Bush Administration must sit face to face with Libya so that we can agree 
on the issues in dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi himself told the journalists that they would be allowed to see the Rabta 
factory, but the frustrating visit that the journalists later made turned out 
to be anything but a close inspection. 
</P>
<P>
A number of intriguing discrepancies, while not conclusive in themselves, also 
raised many more questions about the nature of the factory than the brief and 
ultimately farcical tour of the facility answered. 
</P>
<P>
Turning off the main highway southwest of Tripoli and onto the access road to 
the plant, the reporters passed two military checkpoints, at least one large 
radar installation and several anti-aircraft missile sites perched on the 
bluffs above the isolated desert plain where the factory is located. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-American Protest 
</P>
<P>
The reporters were first driven to a staging area about a mile from the plant, 
where several hundred Libyan citizens staged an anti-American demonstration in 
front of television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Libyan officials said that thousands of ordinary Libyans have flocked to the 
plant in recent days to demonstrate against the United States and to defend the 
factory against a possible attack. 
</P>
<P>
One demonstrator, however, glancing around quickly to make sure no officials 
would overhear him, conceded that he had been ordered to come to the plant. 
Many others appeared less enthusiastic about "sacrificing themselves in the 
defense of their achievements" than Libyan Information Minister Rajab abu 
Dabbous had said they were last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
This appeared to lend credence to suggestions by Western diplomats here that 
the Libyans were obliging civilians to move into the area around the plant in 
an effort to deter the United States from attacking it. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the heavy defenses surrounding the isolated site, which 
appeared to be inconsistent with what the Libyans say is the nature of the 
plant, also have been questioned by diplomats here. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know for sure, but if it is a pharmaceutical plant, why is it so 
isolated?" one Western envoy asked. "You would think that it would be located 
near a hospital or in a city. No other factory of this type has missile sites 
around it." 
</P>
<P>
The reporters saw several truckloads of foreign construction workers leaving 
the plant as they arrived. They were not allowed to talk to the workers, but 
most of them appeared to be from Thailand. Signs in Thai were posted in the 
cafeteria where the workers eat, and one of them nodded affirmatively from a 
passing truck when asked if he was from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has named companies from West Germany, Japan and South Korea as 
having helped Libya build the plant, but this was the first evidence that 
foreign workers are also involved. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters met in the cafeteria with the plant's medical director, Dr. Ali 
Ibrahim, who repeated the official Libyan position that only medicines and 
other pharmaceuticals for civilian use are being made there. 
</P>
<P>
From the cafeteria, located nearly a mile from the main facility,the visitors 
boarded three buses that, only after nightfall, whisked them through the plant 
without making any stops. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was difficult in the darkness and from the moving buses to examine 
the facility, it appeared to consist of at least half a dozen white and 
windowless rectangular buildings two and three stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
Standing away from the plant, but apparently also a part of the facility, were 
a number of large, round, concrete-based storage tanks, arranged in clusters of 
four. Soldiers were encamped in tents around the storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the restrictions placed on what the reporters were allowed to 
see, several other anomalies struck the visitors as significant. One was the 
extraordinary security for the visit. Reporters were assigned to specific 
buses, and their names were checked off on a list each time they re-boarded 
them. This security precaution has not been used on other tours that the 
Libyans have arranged for reporters. Many of the officials accompanying them 
also appeared more nervous than usual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Journalists 
</P>
<P>
Back in Tripoli later, when authorities were asked why the foreign journalists 
-- more than 200 of whom had arrived in Libya last week after a clash between 
U.S. and Libyan jet fighters over the Mediterranean -- were being expelled, one 
official said it was because an "important delegation" was arriving here today. 
He said that their hotel rooms were needed to accommodate the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Other, more sympathetic officials suggested, however, that this was an excuse 
to get rid of the journalists, whose welcome appeared to have suddenly worn out 
after the visit to Rabta. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, citing "conclusive evidence" from satellite photographs and 
other sources of intelligence, has said that the factory was constructed to 
produce chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin, a deadly nerve 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
When fully operational, the nearly completed facility nestled in the remote and 
desolate foothills of the Tripoli Mountains will be able to produce between 
22,000 and 84,000 pounds of mustard and nerve agents daily, making it the 
largest chemical weapons factory in the Third World, U.S. officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the potential danger of letting a nation like Libya, which the United 
States accuses of supporting terrorist movements around the world, produce 
chemical weapons, the Reagan Administration last month said it was considering 
a military strike to destroy the factory. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi's surprise appearance before the foreign journalists Saturday morning 
was made with his customary flamboyance. He turned up at their hotel in a long 
brown cape and driving his own white Peugeot, followed by several carloads of 
security agents. He accused the United States of trying to "terrorize" Libya 
and other small countries and said that he would not give in to American 
threats "even if the confrontation and the pressures . . . last a million 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the colonel also appeared to be seeking a peaceful way out of his latest 
confrontation with Washington with his suggestion that face-to-face talks be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering to open a dialogue with the United States, Kadafi indicated 
that Libya would allow international inspection of the Rabta plant and said it 
is willing to participate in "all negotiations to get rid of weapons in the 
world, from ordinary guns to nuclear bombs."

PRIVATE CARE FOR RETARDED -- A GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was that rare social program, promising to be both economical and humane. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to take thousands of mentally retarded patients out of 
California's big, dismal state hospitals and place them instead in less 
expensive, more homelike settings in the community. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the program has been in operation for about two decades, it is not 
at all clear how much money is being saved, and there is growing concern that 
private facilities can be a lot more dangerous for patients than state 
hospitals, where living conditions for the retarded have greatly improved. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents of retarded patients throughout California are in fact fighting to 
keep their children in state hospitals and out of privately-run homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Russian Roulette' 
</P>
<P>
"I would say generally this game of placement in the community is Russian 
roulette," said John Chase, a veteran advocate for the retarded and a member of 
the advisory board of Camarillo State Hospital, where his daughter is a 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter might go to a community facility and get excellent care," said 
Chase, "and she also might go to a community facility and get killed." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by The Times into care for the mentally retarded in California 
shows that placing patients in privately run facilities can indeed be a deadly 
gamble. Although many such facilities appear to provide quality care, many 
others do not. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing and court records, visits to private facilities and interviews with 
officials, parents, patients and care providers show a widespread pattern of 
lethal neglect, physical and sexual abuse and financial exploitation of 
retarded people living in privately-run facilities throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found that retarded people in private facilities in California often 
are housed in substandard conditions in the care of poorly paid, untrained 
employees, some of whom have criminal records. The retarded residents of these 
facilities sometimes are blind, deaf or crippled and so impaired mentally that 
they are unable to speak for themselves or to complain. At the same time, state 
and private agencies responsible for ensuring safe and proper care often are 
slow to remove patients from apparently dangerous facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* On Nov. 19, 1987, a retarded 29-year-old woman was discovered dead in her bed 
in Sylvia's Cultural Center, a run-down home for retarded and mentally ill 
clients west of downtown Los Angeles. The young woman's abdomen was so swollen 
that investigating officers mistakenly thought she was pregnant. She had died 
of peritonitis in what state licensing officials say must have been an 
excruciatingly painful death. Her bladder -- diseased by a neglected infection 
-- had burst and filled her abdominal cavity with poisonous fluids, according 
to official reports. Lois Maria Miller, manager of the home, said the victim 
was seen by a doctor every month and denied that there was neglect. Some 
patients were removed from the home a month later and the license of the 
facility was suspended last May. 
</P>
<P>
* El Rancho Calimesa, a facility for cerebral palsy victims and the retarded in 
San Bernardino County, faces a hearing before a state administrative law judge 
into charges by the state Department of Social Services that the brother of a 
former staff member sexually molested a patient in the home on July 10, 1987, 
and that "on numerous occasions" the former staff member "threatened clients . 
. . with a gun to their heads as a method of controlling behavior" and used a 
gun to threaten other staff members into bringing him drugs and alcohol. The 
home is still operating. 
</P>
<P>
* A retarded woman gave birth to a baby while in a bathroom of the Lois L. 
Jones Family Home in South-Central Los Angeles in January, 1986, according to 
police and licensing reports. The infant was drowned, apparently in the toilet, 
and was left outside in a trash can, according to police and coroner's reports. 
Licensing inspectors, seeking an emergency closure of the home, also said that 
the memory of the proprietor was so impaired that she could not care for the 
residents. Officials also complained that the proprietor's son, who has a long, 
violent criminal record, was staying in the home. The license of the facility 
finally was suspended in March, 1987, more than a year after the death of the 
newborn child. An attorney for the state said the delay was caused by a 
shortage of legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
* In February, 1986, three retarded residents of a home near San Diego died in 
a fire at the facility. Nayoma Jeannette Raleigh, manager of the home, was 
accused of turning off the fire alarm a week before the blaze and was 
subsequently convicted of manslaughter. David Giles, a former resident of the 
home accused of setting the fire, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
* A 16-year-old autistic boy in the care of the Horizon House in Long Beach 
died Aug. 29, 1987, when staff members of the home allegedly delayed getting 
emergency medical treatment for the youngster after he began throwing up blood, 
according to state licensing reports. 
</P>
<P>
Five days before his death, licensing inspectors had sent documents to 
Sacramento seeking emergency closure of the home because of alleged neglect of 
residents. Horizon House was closed by state officials 2 1/2 weeks after the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Katz, former executive director of Total Living Continuum Inc., a chain of 
homes that included Horizon House, acknowledged that staff members of the home 
were relatively young and inexperienced but denied that they were negligent. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's chain of homes has gone out of business. 
</P>
<P>
* From May to July, 1987, residents of a Behavior Research Institute home in 
Orinda in the San Francisco Bay Area were beaten by a staff member who has a 
criminal record of arrests for attempted murder and convictions for burglaries, 
according to a complaint by state Department of Social Services attorneys 
seeking revocation of BRI's license. The staff member beat one resident with a 
"belt and/or a stick" and struck another resident in the face with his hand, 
according to a formal state accusation. The home was voluntarily closed. 
</P>
<P>
BRI attorney Roderick MacLeish said he does not know whether the abuse 
allegations are true. He said BRI had sent the suspected employee's 
fingerprints to the state for a background check as required and was not 
informed of the criminal record until after the alleged beatings. 
</P>
<P>
* A June, 1987, state licensing inspection of the Golden State Habilitation 
Center for the retarded in Baldwin Park -- operated by nursing home chain Care 
Enterprises -- found that despite repeated citations for poor conditions in 
previous years, "clients and facility personnel continue to live and work in an 
atmosphere of uncleanliness, foul odors, disrepair and roach infestations." 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent inspection last spring resulted in 75 pages of cited deficiencies, 
including allegations of neglect of patients who were unkempt and suffered from 
eye and heavy nasal discharges, dozens of patients below ideal body weight, 
lack of development programs, spoiled food stored in the refrigerator, lack of 
a proper diet, medication errors and lack of supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Care Enterprises, which filed for bankruptcy last spring, nevertheless reported 
a profit of $34,861 on the Golden State Habilitation Center in 1987. The chain 
reported making $123,272 on the facility the year before. 
</P>
<P>
The home is still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made significant staff and management changes," said Bill Izatt, 
spokesman for Care. "We've spent a considerable amount of time and money in 
correcting the problems and we now feel this facility is doing quite well and 
providing quality care to our residents." 
</P>
<P>
* In November, 1987, the International Castle Guest Home for the retarded, an 
old run-down two-story house on South Avalon Boulevard in Los Angeles, was 
cited by licensing officials in connection with two deaths. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, inspectors cited the home operator after staff members of the 
facility allegedly failed to administer proper first aid or promptly call 
paramedics when a 48-year-old retarded male resident choked to death on a steak 
bone Sept. 11, 1987. The citation carried no fine. 
</P>
<P>
Bessie Anderson, operator of the home, maintains that all her staff members are 
properly trained in first aid and had promptly summoned paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
The previous April 2, a 52-year-old severely retarded male resident of 
International Castle was hospitalized at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center with multiple fractures after being hit by a car, according to state 
inspectors. On April 22, he was released back to the home and six days later he 
was readmitted to the hospital in a comatose state, according to a coroner's 
report. He died April 30 of sepsis caused by his infected car accident wounds 
and complicated by pneumonia, according to the coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing inspectors indicated that the hospital may have released the resident 
back to the home prematurely and cited the home for admitting a patient in a 
condition that the staff was unqualified to care for. The citation carried no 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not admit him," Anderson said. "They brought him, left him on the porch 
and took off. . . . We got him back to the hospital as soon as we could." The 
home is still in operation. Anderson maintains that "there was quite a bit of 
repair done on that facility." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also operates a larger facility on South Main Street that houses 33 
retarded residents, some of whom are severely handicapped physically as well as 
mentally impaired and some of whom are blind. 
</P>
<P>
The facility -- a cluster of run-down apartments with walls covered by gang 
graffiti -- was cited last March with 18 pages of licensing violations, 
including general disrepair, broken-down furniture, inoperable lamps, a toilet 
with no seat and rodent droppings on food storage shelves. Anderson refused 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The home is still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lanterman Act 
</P>
<P>
The list of such conditions and occurrences goes on and on throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the way it was intended to be, of course. 
</P>
<P>
California's Lanterman Mental Retardation Act, adopted in 1969 and regularly 
amended since then, provides that mentally retarded people have the right to 
treatment in "the least restrictive" setting possible. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent reduction in the number of mentally retarded patients in state 
hospitals paralleled the "deinstitutionalization" of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
But when mentally ill patients were released from state hospitals, relatively 
little in the way of community care was provided for them, and many former 
mental patients joined the ranks of the homeless wandering city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Deinstitutionalization of the retarded, on the other hand, helped to create a 
more than $400-million-per-year private care industry in California funded by 
state and federal dollars -- at least in part because parents and other 
advocates on behalf of the retarded are better organized and politically more 
effective than those of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a bewildering -- and, according to critics, frequently 
unresponsive -- bureaucratic web of state and quasi-official agencies evolved 
to develop and oversee programs and care for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
The new bureaucracy created its own jargon. The term deinstitutionalization was 
scrapped in favor of normalization and the term developmentally disabled was 
used to describe the patients -- who were called clients. At the same time, the 
state hospitals that served these clients became developmental centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
81,000 Californians 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the 81,000 people in California categorized as developmentally 
disabled suffer from some degree of mental retardation, although the term also 
includes victims of cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Developmental Services is in charge of care for the 
developmentally disabled and contracts with 21 private nonprofit agencies known 
as regional centers located throughout the state. The regional centers, in 
turn, contract with private operators -- both for-profit and nonprofit -- to 
provide care and programs for the clients. The regional centers then place 
selected clients in these community facilities -- ostensibly selecting the 
program best prepared to meet a client's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the clients living in community care homes came from state hospitals. 
Many came from their own homes, where 57% of the state's developmentally 
disabled people live. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the number of developmentally disabled patients in state mental 
hospitals was reduced by half during the last 20 years, dropping from 13,355 in 
1968 to 6,818 in 1987. More than 24,000 developmentally disabled people live in 
privately run facilities in California. More than 12,000 of these patients live 
in homes housing six or fewer residents. Another 6,700 live in larger homes, 
and about 4,500 others live in facilities that provide medical care, some of 
which are large institutional-style complexes resembling nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
The state pays private home operators from $572 to $3,493 per patient per month 
for housing and care, depending on the severity of the client's disability and 
the services offered by the provider. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Comparison 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to compare the cost of keeping patients in the seven 
developmental centers to the actual cost of running the community care system, 
including paying for the operation of regional centers, medical treatment and 
all the other costs connected with private care. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of keeping a client in a developmental center, including everything 
from janitorial service to police to medical care, is $64,666 per year, 
according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of keeping a client who needs minimal to moderate care in a private 
facility is far less, but private intensive care can run as high as $41,916 per 
year, plus thousands of dollars more per year in medical costs, transportation, 
training programs and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Studies seeking precise comparisons in cost have been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of honest-to-God research types have spent lots of years and lots of 
dollars doing this task of trying to find comparability (between state and 
private care costs), and most of the results have been lousy," said Roberta 
Marlowe, assistant director of planning and development for the state 
Department of Developmental Services. 
</P>
<P>
As the private care system grew, something not entirely expected happened: 
</P>
<P>
The old state hospital wards for the retarded were largely transformed. 
Dormitories were broken up into smaller, more home-like living quarters. Staff 
members received better training and pay. Quality treatment programs became 
available. These new developmental centers have been accredited by the 
Accreditation Council on Services for People with Developmental Disabilities, a 
highly regarded private agency headquartered in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's Not Nirvana 
</P>
<P>
Despite these improvements, the state hospitals have not achieved nirvana. 
Obstreperous patients frequently are tied to their beds, sedated or put in 
isolation rooms. The accreditation council survey noted, for example, that a 
patient at Lanterman Developmental Center in Pomona was "was in blindfold and 
restraint for a period of 90 minutes on Nov. 12, 1987." 
</P>
<P>
State health officials fined Lanterman recently for an incident in which a 
staff member slapped a patient. Earlier, health inspectors accused the facility 
of negligence in the death of a patient who choked on food and also cited the 
hospital for neglect of some patients' hygiene, unclean conditions -- including 
feces on a wall -- and inadequate staff. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the 1,000-patient facility appeared clean and well-run, with patients 
receiving intensive training during a tour conducted for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers of the developmental centers see no resemblance between current 
conditions and the old image of state-run "snake pits." In fact, many parents 
of retarded patients in developmental centers are in an ongoing dispute with 
state officials who want to move their children into private care. 
</P>
<P>
Twice each year, developmental center patients are evaluated by a team of 
professionals in the field of mental retardation to determine whether the 
patients might benefit from living in the community. The team examines such 
factors as how independently clients are able to function and whether they are 
self-abusive, assaultive or destructive. But in reality, there seems to be 
little difference between patients in state hospitals and many of those sent to 
private facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents, Conservators 
</P>
<P>
The Times observed, for example, profoundly retarded patients with grave 
physical impairments and serious behavioral problems in both state hospitals 
and private facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The deciding difference between those transferred and those who stay in state 
hospitals is often whether the patient has parents or conservators who object 
to a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
If a parent or conservator protests, the state usually backs off. 
</P>
<P>
Gary D. Macomber, director of the state Department of Developmental Services, 
acknowledged, "We haven't thus far, to the best of my knowledge, moved anyone 
out (of a state hospital) where there was a significant parental objection or 
conservator's objection." 
</P>
<P>
Macomber also acknowledged that private facilities do not offer the same 
consistency in quality of care that is provided by the state developmental 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally," he said, "when we have a problem and we get a (licensing) citation 
in a developmental center, it's a situation where our policies are in place, 
the person was trained appropriately, adequate staffing was there, but that 
human being (staff member) does something incredibly stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get to that point in the community," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Macomber is a proponent of community care and pointed out that many 
parents find that their retarded children make significant progress in private 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that people ought to live in the least restrictive 
environment. Developmental centers play a role in getting people ready to live 
in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Final Placement' 
</P>
<P>
"We don't look at developmental center placement as a final placement for 
anyone. We ought to always look at the opportunities for community placement." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what frightens Matthew Guglielmo and many other parents of 
retarded children. 
</P>
<P>
Guglielmo is president of the parents group at Fairview State Hospital in 
Orange County, where his daughter is a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Guglielmo's 26-year-old daughter is profoundly retarded, partially blind and 
deaf. She has been at the developmental center at Fairview for more than 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a little Leisure World," said Guglielmo. "Fairview to me is a 
delightful place today compared to what it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
His daughter was once in a small private facility, he said, where she did not 
receive proper care or nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
But Guglielmo is 68 years old and is afraid that when he dies and is unable to 
protest, his daughter might again be sent to a private facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be afraid some do-gooder would come along and say she belongs in the 
community," he said. "There are . . . good facilities out there, but they are 
few and far between." 
</P>
<P>
These community care facilities are regulated by a maze of state and private 
agencies that sometimes have parallel, overlapping and even conflicting 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rife With Advocates' 
</P>
<P>
If patients require medical care or supervision, they may be placed in homes 
supervised by the state Department of Health Services, but most homes for the 
retarded come under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Social 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Each regional center also is responsible for the quality of care provided to 
clients within that center's jurisdiction. In addition, there are agencies 
called area boards throughout the state that are made up of citizens who are 
supposed to oversee regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
There is also Protection and Advocacy, the legal agency responsible for 
protecting clients' rights. And there are public ombudsmen throughout the state 
who investigate complaints regarding care in various community facilities, 
including nursing homes and homes for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is rife with advocates," said Macomber. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the system is so fragmented that the responsible agencies often 
don't communicate and sometimes fail to cooperate with one another. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Social Services has the authority to close facilities 
that it licenses, and each regional center has the authority to remove clients 
from homes within its area of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
These agencies often are at odds. Frequently, Social Service officials seek 
revocation of licenses of homes in which regional centers continue to place 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Different Perspective' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different perspective," said Gail Sass, associate director of the 
Harbor Regional Center in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Social Services) tend to think the most difficult clients we have don't 
belong in community facilities," she said. "I think we have a somewhat basic 
philosophical commitment that developmentally disabled clients have the right 
to live in the community and take risks rather than live in the state 
developmental centers." 
</P>
<P>
But Fred Miller, chief of community care licensing for the Department of Social 
Services, believes that regional centers should take more responsibility to see 
that homes for the retarded are adequately staffed and administered. 
</P>
<P>
He also contends that regional center officials, who are responsible for making 
regular progress reports on individual clients, are in a better position to 
spot dangerous conditions in homes than licensing officials who might make only 
one visit a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has to be a shared responsibility," he said. "And the placement 
agency is certainly there (in the homes) more often than community care 
licensing (officials)." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, parents and other critics frequently complain that regional 
centers often are reluctant to remove clients from poorly run homes because 
facilities for difficult to handle clients are scarce and because regional 
centers are guided by the state mandate of keeping as many clients as possible 
in community care rather than in state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Vested Interest' 
</P>
<P>
"The regional center does placement, monitoring and pays the bill," said the 
head of a citizens' area board, who asked not to be named, "so they definitely 
have a vested interest in keeping people in placements that may not be 
appropriate, because there may not be another (community facility available)." 
</P>
<P>
But regional center officials argue that it is often preferable to work with a 
home operator to improve a facility than it is to remove clients. 
</P>
<P>
The South Central Regional Center came under heavy criticism from the area 
board and the state Department of Developmental Services in 1987 for allegedly 
failing to monitor conditions in group homes where cases of severe neglect and 
at least one death occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Under threat from the state of losing its contract to operate, the regional 
center subsequently reorganized its administration and board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"South Central has improved," said Developmental Services chief Macomber, "but 
it still has a long way to go." In the end, with all the advocates for the 
retarded, enforcement of standards in homes for the retarded usually comes down 
to licensing officials of the Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the process of revoking a license is dangerously slow, and some 
licensing inspectors complain that the system of fining operators for 
violations is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
For example, under the state Department of Social Services enforcement system, 
home operators are allowed to simply correct dangerous conditions after being 
cited, without paying a fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Repairs 
</P>
<P>
"You can cite over and over and over for the same violation," said a license 
inspector who spoke on condition of anonymity. "As long as they (temporarily) 
fix the violation, they'll never be fined. I could literally go to the same 
place once a month and cite the same violation." 
</P>
<P>
When fines are levied for uncorrected violations, the state must go to court to 
collect them if the operator doesn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, chief of Social Services licensing, argues that citations are meant to 
prod operators into correcting poor conditions and that for serious violations, 
such as physical or sexual abuse, the remedy should be closure of the facility, 
not fines. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that a facility in which abuse occurs could be closed within a day, 
under emergency procedures, but that usually much more time -- frequently 
months -- is needed to gather evidence for such an action, and that revocation 
of a home's license can take years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, say state officials, the closure of allegedly dangerous homes and 
the relocation of residents is sometimes delayed because there is a shortage of 
facilities for the developmentally disabled and because sometimes parents 
resist the relocation of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Many advocates for the retarded -- such as the Greenline Parent Group at 
Camarillo State Hospital -- believe that uniform quality of care for the 
developmentally disabled could be provided in community settings if the state 
operated the homes and provided trained, well-paid staff members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'System Is Unstable' 
</P>
<P>
"The state has really abdicated its responsibility in not taking a larger hand 
in operating these community facilities," argued John Chase, a member of 
Greenline. 
</P>
<P>
"The community system is unstable," he continued, "because they pay minimum 
wages and have no career ladder to offer people. They (staff members) just stay 
until something else comes along." 
</P>
<P>
Macomber says state-run community care facilities is an "option," but he is 
cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Macomber is instead hoping to improve the quality of care in private facilities 
in the future by hiring the Accreditation Council on Services for People with 
Developmental Disabilities in a pilot project to see if the accreditation 
process used to improve state hospitals can be applied to private homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime he is banking on better quality of care through a project 
called the Alternative Residential Model, which is already in operation in 
selected regional center areas and is expected to be in effect statewide by 
January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Basically ARM, as it is called, provides more money to home operators and 
demands standardized documentation of quality of care criteria, monitored by 
regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been client deaths of a questionable nature in ARM homes. 
</P>
<P>
And, not surprisingly, there is some skepticism in the field that Macomber's 
plans will solve the community care problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter this fall to the department, the Greenline Parent Group 
acknowledged that the ARM and accreditation projects are "a step in the right 
direction" but added that "the step is too short and too slow." 
</P>
<P>
"When the helpless suffer," says the letter, "the able must not delay relief."

SHULTZ WARNS OF POISON GAS IN TERRORIST HANDS

Diplomatically avoiding use of the word Libya, Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz called on the world Saturday to prevent the "nightmare" of chemical and 
biological weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to join me in committing our governments not only to prevent the 
use of chemical weapons in armed conflict but also to prevent the spread of 
chemical weapons to terrorist groups," Shultz said in the keynote speech to an 
international conference on gas warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz did not repeat U.S. charges that Libya -- a nation Washington has long 
accused of supporting international terrorism -- is building a massive poison 
gas plant in the desert near Tripoli. But there was no doubt that his words 
were directed at Col. Moammar Kadafi's regime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washington-Bonn Tension 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before his speech, Shultz met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher in an effort to defuse a growing Washington-Bonn dispute 
over American charges that a West German industrial firm, Imhausen-Chemie, 
provided technical assistance to the Libyan project. 
</P>
<P>
Standing side by side after their talks, Shultz and Genscher announced that 
technical experts from the two countries will meet in Washington next week for 
a thorough review of U.S. intelligence concerning the Libyan project. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be trying to provide as much information as we can," a senior U.S. 
official said later. "If it's new information, we will (supply it); if it's 
more detailed reports of things we have already provided, we will do that." 
</P>
<P>
Genscher said that the United States and West Germany are both determined "to 
prevent this further proliferation of chemical weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said: "I have a total confidence that my colleague, Foreign Minister 
Genscher, and Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl and others in the German government take 
this issue with great seriousness. They have absolutely no time for any 
involvement by Germany, by Germans, by German firms in chemical weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The West German firm denies any association with the Libyan project, and Kohl's 
government has protested U.S. handling of the allegations against the company. 
Kadafi insists that the plant at Rabta, about 40 miles southwest of Tripoli, is 
intended to produce pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the conference, which attracted 145 nations, well over the 130 
originally expected, Shultz said that the world must act at once to stop the 
production and spread of poison gas because "ever more lethal and insidious 
chemical weapons are being developed -- weapons which defeat defenses and are 
devastating in their effects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shultz Treads Carefully 
</P>
<P>
Shultz's speech was crafted to avoid giving offense. He decried the use of 
chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War without naming either country. The United 
Nations has accused Iraq of extensive use of chemical weapons in that conflict. 
Iran has been accused of far more limited use of poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who followed Shultz to the podium, 
was far more blunt. He accused the international community of ignoring Iraqi 
use of chemical weapons, suggesting that there was little outrage because the 
victims were not Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
He demanded to know "why did not anybody think of holding such a conference" 
seven years ago when, he said, Iraq first used gas weapons. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the conference would have been held much sooner if the victims 
had been French, Belgians, British or other Europeans. The present Paris 
meeting was called to reaffirm a ban on the use of chemical weapons that was 
drafted at a conference in 1925, seven years after the end of World War I, when 
the victims were mostly from Europe. That war is the conflict in which the use 
of gas was the most extensive and the most deadly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neither Iraq Nor Libya 
</P>
<P>
Neither Iraq nor Libya was among the first day's speakers. They will get their 
chance later in the conference, which runs through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 foreign ministers attended the opening of the conference although 
some, like Shultz, plan to leave before it ends. Shultz is scheduled to return 
to Washington today after a private meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze, who has been sharply critical of the United States for its 
confrontation with Libya. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Shultz said the 1925 protocol against the use of chemical 
weapons "had effect for six decades. . . . Yet in recent years, the 
international norms against chemical weapons use have begun to erode in 
practice -- first in the Middle East and, most recently, in regional conflicts 
from Southeast Asia, to Afghanistan, to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"A nightmare for all, of course, would be the combination of ballistic 
missiles, chemical warheads and biological weapons in the hands of governments 
with histories of the conduct of terrorist violence," he said. "There are no 
insurmountable technical obstacles that would prevent terrorist groups from 
using chemical weapons." 
</P>
<P>
He called for increased power for the U.N. secretary general to investigate 
charges of the use of chemical weapons and suggested that the United Nations 
could vote economic and other sanctions against violators.

PLANNERS SEEK SOLUTION TO SUBURBAN GRIDLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS IS URGED TO SHIFT FOCUS FROM INTERSTATE PROJECTS TO LOCAL FUNDING TO 
CUT TRAFFIC PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the postwar American Dream. When Congress approved the Interstate 
Highway System in 1944, it paved the way for about 44,000 miles of new roads 
that would link cities from coast to coast and whisk commuters from suburban 
homes to downtown jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Now the interstate system is virtually complete, a monument to America's love 
affair with the automobile. But in the nation's rapidly growing suburbs, 
drivers face more woes than ever. From Orange County to Long Island, millions 
of motorists are caught up in massive traffic jams, fighting their way through 
streets that were never designed to handle so many cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop-and-Go Commute 
</P>
<P>
For a growing number of Americans, the drive from their home to a nearby 
shopping center has come to rival the ordeal of a stop-and-go commute to work. 
Unforeseen 40 years ago, suburban congestion has become the fastest-growing 
traffic problem in America today. 
</P>
<P>
But it is only recently that Washington has begun to take notice. Federal 
highway programs have been primarily designed to build freeways, leaving state 
and county governments to resolve congestion on local streets. This year, 
however, Congress will start drafting a new blueprint for the nation's 
$14-billion federal highway program, and experts predict that metropolitan 
gridlock will at last be a prime target. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we're facing problems in the suburbs that were not envisioned years 
ago," said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), the chairman of the House 
Public Works and Transportation Committee. "As we decide the future of the 
highway program, we have to be aware of the need for solutions. . . . The 
economic health of the nation depends on it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the failure of suburban streets to handle the growing number of cars 
has caused heavy traffic jams on the nation's interstates, as many motorists 
now use freeways to travel 2 to 3 miles as part of their daily commute. That, 
in turn, has made it difficult for millions of trucks across the nation to 
maintain on-time deliveries for their cargoes, causing delays and economic 
problems for a multitude of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, this local problem becomes a barrier to interstate commerce," said 
Robert Farris, director of the Federal Highway Administration. "All of these 
transportation issues are interrelated, and we've got to start looking at them 
simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, Anderson's panel will hold hearings on myriad transportation 
problems this year, including suburban congestion, crumbling bridges, crowded 
interstates, mass transit needs and the environmental consequences of building 
more highways. If all goes as planned, Congress will approve a new Surface 
Transportation Act in 1991, the first of the "post interstate" era. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is important because a broad coalition of transportation 
experts and state and local officials is urging Congress to shift its attention 
away from freeway projects. In particular, they want federal funds now 
earmarked for highway work to be distributed with fewer strings attached so 
cities and suburbs can have greater flexibility in devising ways to relieve 
their jammed streets. 
</P>
<P>
Few of them doubt the importance of maintaining and upgrading the interstate 
system, which represents a multibillion-dollar investment, but they argue that 
other needs are equally important. 
</P>
<P>
On the local level, this could mean more projects to widen suburban boulevards, 
synchronize traffic lights, launch light-rail systems and experiment with 
van-pooling programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reducing Truck Activity 
</P>
<P>
In California, planners say, it could speed up completion of toll-road projects 
in Orange County and efforts to reduce congestion on Victory Boulevard in the 
San Fernando Valley. Programs to reduce the number of trucks on the Long Beach 
and San Diego freeways could also benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are past the point in this country where we can just keep building freeways 
to reduce congestion," said Jim Beall, a San Jose city councilman and member of 
the "Transportation 2020" task force, a national study group created by 
transportation officials to find new solutions for traffic problems. "We 
shouldn't have to spend money on freeways just because that's the only way 
Washington says the money can be spent." 
</P>
<P>
In drawing up the new plan, many experts say, it is crucial that Washington 
avoid trying to devise one cure for suburban congestion, because its forms and 
causes differ substantially from one community to the next across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no magic bill that Congress can pass into law that will solve this 
problem," said Francis B. Francois, executive director of the Assn. of State 
Highway and Transportation Officials. "If there are 50 different metropolitan 
areas with the problem, then 50 different answers are needed. What works in Los 
Angeles won't work in Boston, and that's why there needs to be more flexibility 
in the system." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Needs 
</P>
<P>
But getting Congress to agree to such sweeping changes may not be easy, given 
the conflicting needs of urban and rural communities, said one House 
transportation aide. States such as Idaho and Montana are heavily dependent on 
federal funds for their roads, and they might oppose a new division of funds 
that focuses more on metropolitan problems. 
</P>
<P>
It may be even more difficult to increase federal spending on road programs, as 
members of Transportation 2020 and some in Congress have urged. The blue-ribbon 
group has suggested that annual spending by all levels of government on highway 
projects, now some $63 billion, eventually be increased to $100 billion, to 
maintain bridges and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
That may be unlikely, however, given the federal government's reluctance to 
spend all the money now being raised for highways. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1956, the sole source of funds for the program has been the federal 
gasoline tax, which goes into a special account called the Highway Trust Fund. 
In recent years, Congress has withheld spending about 10% of the money flowing 
into the trust fund to help offset the nation's $155-billion budget deficit. 
Currently, while $14 billion is distributed annually for highways, there is an 
unused surplus of about $13.6 billion in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House Rejection Cited 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and others would like to see that money freed up for transportation 
projects, including about $1 billion for work in California. But they have lost 
several House votes to exempt the highway funds from budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential barrier to increased transportation spending would be a 
proposed hike in the federal gasoline tax, now being discussed by members of 
Congress as a deficit-fighting measure. Highway advocates fear that such an 
increase in the 9 cents per gallon federal tax would discourage many states 
from raising their own gasoline taxes and thus retard the growth of locally 
sponsored transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, transportation officials are watching these battles closely. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be monitoring Congress carefully, to see how they change the 
highway program," said Robert Best, director of Caltrans, the state's 
transportation agency. "What happens in Washington matters very much to us 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Few dispute the need for change. Federal, state and local officials agree that 
the current highway program is geared to a bygone era of sleepy bedroom suburbs 
and commuters heading for distant, downtown jobs. In the last 30 years, there 
has been an explosive growth in the size and economic importance of American 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth in Jobs Soar 
</P>
<P>
From 1960 to 1980, the number of jobs located in the suburbs grew from 14 
million to 33 million. More than 25 million commuters drive every day from a 
suburban home to a suburban job, or 38% of all trips. Not surprisingly, the 
suburb-to-suburb commute has become the nation's most prevalent route of daily 
transportation, according to a demographic study by the Eno Foundation for 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, state and local officials are demanding that the federal highway 
program keep pace with this shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of people are expecting that there will be a great deal 
more money from the federal government," said Monte Ward, government affairs 
director for the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But if local 
governments had a freer hand in spending these funds, it could make a real 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, where traffic congestion has become a way of life, is a case in 
point. Local officials are committed to freeway improvements but they are also 
eager to use federal funds more creatively on other efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the county is moving forward with plans, using federal funds, for 
three toll roads that would give motorists an alternative to traffic-choked 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rail Service Possible 
</P>
<P>
In addition, county officials are considering opening commuter rail service on 
the existing Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail corridor. Under the plan, commuters 
could ride from Irvine to downtown Los Angeles or from San Juan Capistrano to 
downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, however, would require a more flexible use of federal money, 
diverting highway funds to improve stations and acquire rail cars, Ward said. 
Under the present federal program, he noted, mass transit funds "are geared 
toward traditional patterns in the East, where suburban areas surround the big 
city." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, where suburbs have grown without a definable city 
center, "we don't compete well for those funds," he said. "It's another reason 
why there should be more freedom to move funds around." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a more flexible federal program could allow the county to spend more 
on streamlining the traffic flow on key arterial streets such as Beach and 
Katella boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, federal highway programs don't allocate much money to such 
projects, but if they did, you could make these kinds of decisions," he said. 
"You could decide that it might be more important to synchronize traffic 
signals on Beach Boulevard than to spend all of your money on freeways." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions May Worsen 
</P>
<P>
Without these improvements, experts believe traffic congestion in Orange County 
and other suburban areas will worsen. Eventually, local, state and federal 
officials will have to work together on ways to link housing growth with 
transportation and plan future development throughout these regions, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public is concerned about congestion, even though they haven't yet 
pegged it as a national issue," said Ray Barnhart, former head of the Federal 
Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we don't take intelligent steps now, we're going to be looking at a 50% 
increase in Los Angeles traffic over the next 30 years. If we do nothing to 
expand the capacity down there, you might as well shut the community down."

Those faint fright tremors jolting most major-college football offices about 
the country just now are similar to what hits particular corporate board rooms 
each time IBM gets inspirational. Notre Dame (Gulp!) is back. Even more 
unsettling, Coach Lou Holtz is worried. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz is a witty man. After a loss at Arkansas once, he opened his television 
show by saying: "Welcome to the Lou Holtz Show. Unfortunately, I'm Lou Holtz." 
A golfer, the closest he says he has ever come to a hole in one is bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the most laughter Holtz generated during a press conference the morning 
Notre Dame officially became national champion was for saying: "I'll be shocked 
if we have a good year (next season)." 
</P>
<P>
When the chuckles stopped, Holtz quickly apologized. He knew us sainted scribes 
could be fooled about a lot of things; he'd done a fair amount of the 
slickering himself during this 12-0 season and before drubbing West Virginia in 
the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The sly coach said he understood how paid skeptics could recoil at such 
apparent folly, that he would be startled if the gifted and experienced Irish 
did much more next season than get each cleat on the proper foot. 
</P>
<P>
He'd have laughed, too, Holtz admitted. Then he asked his frequent foils to 
understand his position, which he never bothered to explain because he already 
had done that a half-hour earlier. Indirectly. By quoting a high-school coach. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had talked about recruiting a player for Notre Dame. During a visit with 
the prospect's coach, Holtz asked why he had enjoyed such uninterrupted 
success. That nationally obscure high-school coach said: "We don't get bored 
watching us run the same play over and over." 
</P>
<P>
Boredom is the crabgrass of careers -- and Holtz knows it. That's why he rails 
at his players, pushes his staff and himself so hard. He also says: "If we're 
No. 1, I don't care who's No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
To stay on top, Holtz has got to remain infatuated over the possibilities with 
a football, even though all you can really do is throw it, catch it, run it, 
keep from dropping it and make sure the other guys don't spike it in the end 
zone too often. 
</P>
<P>
With regards to that last thing, Holtz wants a kinder, gentler Notre Dame 
defense than the one nailed for so much unsportsmanlike conduct during the 
34-21 rout of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The coach even got a penalty, for dashing onto the field in the final minutes, 
with victory well in hand. He was not grasping for Irish necks, only for the 
source of that rare lack of Irish poise. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz said his players were angry over being held, and frustrated that the 
officials seemed so inattentive. The coach said his players were wrong, but not 
cheap-shotters. Except for once, when a West Virginia player caught a touchdown 
pass and the Notre Dame defender tried to shove him into Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise you this," Holtz said. "You won't see that again." 
</P>
<P>
To keep the supply line of pure hearts, massive bodies, swift feet and keen 
minds moving toward South Bend, Ind., Holts must remember to forget a popular 
notion: Notre Dame doesn't recruit so much as it crooks a finger. 
</P>
<P>
If Holtz wants to claim a national title on the field somewhere down the line, 
he must be a winner in the right living rooms these next several weeks. Every 
mother's meal must be a classic; no father's botched effort at humor can bring 
anything but merriment from a master storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz stays lean, he jokes, so he'll be easier to carry off the field. 
Actually, he admits, the reason for all those pre-game milkshakes is a problem 
with low blood sugar. Whatever, he looks hungry and talks as though near 
starvation about next season. 
</P>
<P>
"In everything we do," he said, "we've got to raise it a notch." With that in 
mind, Holtz phoned prospects not long after the victory that kept Notre Dame 
atop the polls; he met with quarterback Tony Rice early the next morning and 
used a sermon he also will preach often to others: 
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll find out how we all handle success." The team, and Rice most 
especially, "won't be in the background any more." 
</P>
<P>
The coach has been tough on Rice during practice and severe about him in 
public. Rice ought to be flattered, in a way, because the coach treats his 
quarterback in public no less affectionately than the coach does his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz has said: "We were at a beach one summer, and I had a bathing suit on. My 
wife looked at me and said: 'Boy, you are skinny, aren't you?' I said: 'Honey, 
I'd like to remind you that it was minor defects like this that kept me from 
getting a better wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
The team also was a tease, late in the third quarter against West Virginia. Two 
plays after surrendering a touchdown that had narrowed the lead to 26-13, Rice 
threw an interception that gave the Mountaineers the ball at the Notre Dame 26. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia had the ball for three plays. It didn't get a touchdown; it 
didn't get a field goal. What happened was a Mountaineers' trip backwards that 
ended with, of all deflating things, a punt followed by an 80-yard Notre Dame 
burst for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had fussed before the game: "We cannot flinch." Nobody did, and Holtz 
will have trouble fooling even the dullest minds from now on. 
</P>
<P>
He might try and hide his obsession behind self-deprecating one-liners, but who 
will believe him? Holtz insists he never dreamed of winning a national title, 
yet he had a bailout clause in his contract at Minnesota for the job he now 
has. 
</P>
<P>
Any coach who wants so badly to coach at Notre Dame also wants to join Rockne 
and Leahy in Notre Dame history. The ordinary-looking fellow with Olympian 
ambition seems to be saying, as Notre Damers did when they peeked behind those 
thick glasses and saw genius: let the gains begin.

IT'S FINALLY TIME TO TAKE THE CAVALIERS SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They've won nine games in a row, a franchise record. They've won 33 of their 
last 40 regular-season games. They're leading the league in field-goal 
percentage and scoring defense and outscoring the opposition by an astonishing 
margin of 11.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
You sort of get the feeling it's time to take the Cleveland Cavaliers 
seriously. They're 22-5 and the championship-starved city of Cleveland is in a 
frenzy over them. In fact, the situation is almost enough to elicit emotional 
reaction from Coach Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
Almost. Wilkens isn't about to pronounce his team incapable of winning a 
championship, but Cleveland's impassive head coach isn't exactly guaranteeing 
one, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We're what, 27 games into the season?" Wilkens said yesterday. "We have to 
keep this in perspective. Anything can happen in the end, but I still say 
Atlanta and Detroit will have a lot to say." 
</P>
<P>
Still, if the Cavs are operating remotely close to their current level, they'll 
have a considerable say in May and, yes, June. Wilkens and Wayne Embry, 
Cleveland's equally canny general manager, have brought the Cavs along far more 
quickly than anyone could have imagined when they took over a disoriented 
franchise 30 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Embry has rapidly reconstructed the Cavs through a series of sound 
draft choices and judicious trades. He and Wilkens have assembled a team 
well-suited for the '80s, one that can run you to death while confounding you 
with intelligent team defense. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Daugherty, Ron Harper, Mark Price and John Williams, all rookies in 
1986-87, are now playing like seasoned veterans. Larry Nance and Mike Sanders, 
acquired from Phoenix last February, have brought defense and savvy to the 
starting forward spots. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Embry snatched Craig Ehlo from the discard pile, discovered 
Yale's Chris Dudley in the fourth round and acquired Darnell Valentine from 
Miami for a second-round draft pick. Suddenly, the team is so deep that Tree 
Rollins, who came from Atlanta last summer as a $1 million free agent, can't 
find any playing time. 
</P>
<P>
The primary concern now is guarding against overconfidence. But Wilkens, who 
was a pretty fair guard in his day, won't permit it. While things are going 
smoothly, his players have never proven themselves under playoff duress, when 
there are no easy baskets and every possession is a veritable gang war. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're finally starting to understand that," Wilkens said. "The running 
game comes easy ... but the hard thing is getting them to understand the 
half-court game. You don't really learn that until the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
So we won't really know about this team until the postseason, though chances 
are they won't maintain their current 66-win pace. But they sure are scaring 
people now. 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Eve violence, NBA-style: 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Utah's Bobby Hansen and Bart Kofoed were celebrating the New 
Year in a party at Hansen's home. Early Sunday morning, Hansen and Kofoed, 
off-court chums and the only Jazz players in attendance, got involved in some 
friendly horseplay. 
</P>
<P>
The wrestling got out of hand, however, and ended with Kofoed punching Hansen 
in the face and fracturing the orbital bone (cheekbone) below his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Hansen underwent surgery and is expected to miss six to eight weeks. 
His backup, meanwhile, is out of a job. The Jazz put Kofoed on waivers because 
of his ill-fated holiday punch. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appropriate measure," Utah General Manager Dave Checketts said in a 
prepared statement. "The results of what began as a play-around resulted in 
something serious. ... Whether the punch was provoked or not was not the issue. 
There's absolutely no excuse for throwing a punch." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Hansen and Kofoed left Utah without a backup off guard, so 6-11 
Thurl Bailey got time at the position Tuesday. Wednesday the Jazz signed Jim 
Farmer to replace Hansen. Now they have to fill Kofoed's spot. 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Pacers are expected to name Dick Versace head coach sometime 
before the weekend, and if so, Detroit's Chuck Daly will lose his second top 
assistant in six months. Ron Rothstein, his former first assistant, resigned 
last summer to become coach of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to lose another assistant so soon, Detroit General Manager Jack 
McCloskey resisted the initial overtures of Indiana General Manager Donnie 
Walsh. But there is an unwritten rule that says you don't hold back an 
assistant with a shot at a head job (though Boston ignored it when Jimmy 
Rodgers wanted to interview with the Knicks two years ago). 
</P>
<P>
"Jack's first reaction was no," Versace said Tuesday. "But then he came back 
and said, 'I talked with Chuck and you've been real good to us, we've been 
successful, and we both feel we can't stand in your way.' 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck doesn't want anyone working for him who doesn't want to be a head 
coach," said Versace, who never made it a secret that he aspired to be a head 
man one day. "He's the quintessential man's man." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore: Charles Oakley's 14 offensive rebounds Tuesday against the Celtics 
were the most by an NBA player this season. ... Seattle's Dale Ellis has made 
14 of his last 18 three-point shots, lifting his percentage to 50.5 and moving 
him past the Knicks' Trent Tucker for second place in the league behind Miami's 
Jon Sundvold. Ellis, who has scored at least 20 points in all but two games 
this season, is the third-leading scorer in the league at 28.6. ... Miami 
rookie Kevin Edwards committed 11 turnovers Tuesday, the most giveaways since 
Chris Mullin had 13 last March against Utah. ... Milwaukee's Jack Sikma hit 
five three-point bombs against Atlanta last week, believed to be the 
single-game record for a center. . . . Detroit is angling for Golden State 
off-guard Terry Teagle, who hasn't played in more than a month. Teagle could 
probably be had for a second-round pick. Warren LaGarie, Teagle's agent, is 
trying to find a job in Europe for Darryl Dawkins, which would create a spot on 
the Pistons' roster. Meanwhile, the Pistons are still said to be shopping John 
Salley, who is apparently out of favor with Chuck Daly. ... Sometimes, being a 
benchwarmer can be rewarding. Take Steve Alford. Alford, who was waived by 
Dallas last month, is still being paid his guaranteed $150,000 salary by the 
Mavs. But because he was picked up by the Warriors and survived the Dec. 27 
deadline, Alford is also guaranteed a paycheck from Golden State for the 
balance of the season. So Alford is being paid by two teams for doing, 
essentially, nothing.

EAGLESON SAYS NHL-SOVIET PLAY GOOD FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SMITH, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Super Series between two Soviet teams and various National Hockey League 
teams has produced only one unattractive game for the fans in the first 10 and 
has been a financial and aesthetic success, according to the league's chief 
international negotiator, Alan Eagleson. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson, speaking by phone from Toronto, said the 14-game series that will 
conclude Tuesday will "pump $5 million into hockey," including more than $1.5 
million for the players' pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
According to club figures, the first 10 games drew an average of 14,296 fans, 
which represents 85 percent of capacity at the arenas. And that was despite the 
New York Islanders' crowd of 9,504 at Nassau Coliseum against Red Army. 
</P>
<P>
"When we booked that game," said Eagleson, who also is the executive director 
of the Players' Association, "the Islanders had won the Patrick Division title. 
Who knew this (tumble to last place) was going to happen? We were a little 
disappointed with the crowd on the Island ... but the Pittsburgh game was worth 
having the series for. Somebody knocked off Red Army! People saw Mario Lemieux 
put his magic to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Canadian TV did six games and the New Jersey game was the only one they were 
disappointed with -- because it was over so early." The Devils lost, 5-0. "If 
we had all stinkers, we'd have to look at it. But as long as we're drawing more 
than 75 percent and getting quality games, the more the better." 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson said the final games -- in Hartford, Buffalo, St. Louis and Minnesota 
-- probably will be seen by small crowds because those NHL teams have losing 
records and have been drawing poorly. He said the Soviets will net about 
$35,000 per game plus expenses and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
There was concern in NHL circles about overkill because this is the fifth 
meeting in the past three years between NHL players and the Soviets. The others 
were Super Series '86, Rendez-Vous '87, Canada Cup '87 and the 1988 Calgary 
Olympic Games. NHL players also competed against the Soviets in the 1986 and 
1987 World Championships. "I think we're going to play them every year," 
Eagleson said. "Next year they're going to play one game in all 21 NHL cities. 
We expect to have either three Soviet teams playing seven games each or four 
teams with each playing one of our divisions. I hope that happens in each of 
the next five years. And then we'll have the Canada Cup in '91 or '92." 
Eagleson said money is the primary reason the Soviets will travel here next 
season and most of the proceeds will benefit their federation's hockey 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleson said the NHL will announce on Jan. 25 the names of the two teams that 
will tour the Soviet Union in September. A source close to Eagleson said one 
Canadian-based team and one U.S. team will be chosen and Calgary, Quebec and 
Montreal are the Canadian front-runners, with Washington and Pittsburgh the top 
candidates among U.S. teams. 
</P>
<P>
Not all NHL officials are as gung-ho as Eagleson about international 
competition. "So what?" Rangers General Manager Phil Esposito said about the 
current series. "The Players Association makes good money, but some of the 
teams had minor-leaguers playing. L.A. had a whole line. We didn't want to play 
them. We didn't want to play them next year. But we're going to have to." 
</P>
<P>
Esposito said the Rangers might play two exhibition games in London this fall, 
possibly against Scandinavian teams. 
</P>
<P>
A Bob Probert sweepstakes is being conducted by Detroit General Manager Jim 
Devellano, who is trying to make a deal with either Calgary, Hartford, the 
Rangers, Los Angeles or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Probert, the Red Wings' 6-3, 210-pound All-Star left wing who has had 
alcohol-related problems, got three goals and two assists in a three-game span 
in December, but is pointless in the 11 other games he has played. Devellano 
has told some observers Probert might be gone any day now. "I haven't been able 
to get anybody to say, 'Yes,' " he said. "Maybe they think I'm asking too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Sources, who said the Red Wings thought they had a deal for Probert Tuesday, 
also have said the reason no deal has evolved with the Rangers is Devellano 
wants defenseman James Patrick, and Esposito does not want to part with his 
power-play point man. "I have not talked to Jimmy D about Probert," Esposito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are said to have dangled feisty right wing Marty McSorley and left 
wing Bob Carpenter. A Red Wings source said if Probert is traded, Detroit will 
have to get a tough player in return. That eliminates Hartford defenseman Dave 
Babych. Devellano would love to get Joel Otto from the Flames or Steve Kasper 
from the Bruins. Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito bristled when asked if 37-year-old, fourth-line center Marcel Dionne 
or center Lucien DeBlois, who will be 32 in June, will survive the season as 
Rangers. Esposito said his acquisition of center Carey Wilson Dec. 26 came 
after Whalers President Emile Francis called and asked for Norm Maciver, Brian 
Lawton and Don Maloney. "That's a dumb question, 'Who's next?"' Esposito said. 
"I do whatever it takes to win. You want me to stay stagnant, not win and lose 
my job? When a deal is made, it's not me offering. It's other teams asking." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerry Wilson, a Winnipeg orthopedic surgeon and father of Carey Wilson, 
convinced Swedes Anders Hedberg, Ulf Nilsson and Lars-Erik Sjoberg to sign with 
the World Hockey Association's Jets in 1974. Wilson said his father went to 
Sweden to write a book on the physiology of hockey players. "He used the 
Swedish national team as guinea pigs," Wilson said, "and worked with Hedberg. 
He was able to convince him and the others to come. He wasn't working for the 
Jets, but he was a fan and scouted for them." 
</P>
<P>
Carey Wilson knows enough of the language to talk to linemate Tomas Sandstrom 
in Swedish in the dressing room, but he does not use it on the ice, he said, 
because "I don't think in Swedish." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chelios is not on the block in Montreal. He is paired with stay-at-home 
Craig Ludwig and playing the best hockey of his career. The Canadiens have won 
eight straight and are 23-3-5 in their past 31. Over the holidays, they became 
the first team since the 1982-83 Islanders to win consecutive road games in 
Calgary (4-3) and Edmonton (4-2). They also beat the Kings (3-2) and Canucks 
(4-0) on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NHLPA, the average length of a player's career is 5.53 years, 
up from last year's 5.47. Their average age is 25.34, up from 25.24. The 
average salary of 318 American-based players is $179,000, up from last year's 
$166,000, and the average salary of 160 Canadian-based players is $205,000 
(Canadian), up from $187,000. The figures do not include signing bonuses. A 
Canadian dollar is worth about 85 cents (American).

SETON HALL FINALLY REAPING BENEFITS OF BIG EAST CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The best thing about Seton Hall is that it's in the Big East Conference," P.J. 
Carlesimo once noted from the perspective of head basketball coach. "The worst 
thing about Seton Hall is that it's in the Big East Conference." Clearly, 
membership has been a two-sided backboard for the South Orange, N.J., 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Because Seton Hall wasn't fully committed to competing against the powerhouse 
teams in such an elite group, it languished at the bottom for most of the 
decade. But precisely because it belonged to such a high-profile league, it had 
the ability to attract talent capable of playing with the best teams in the 
nation. The source of its failure would be the source of its success. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Pirates sit atop the Big East Conference, Carlesimo can testify -- 
without apparent embarrassment -- that if the program hadn't been in such dire 
straits, it might not have taken a chance on a small-name coach from Wagner 
College in 1982. "People didn't want the job," he said Wednesday evening. "It 
didn't pay enough for them to get a proven, successful, big-time guy." 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo has become all of the above in the last two seasons. A year ago, the 
Pirates reached the semifinal round of the Big East postseason tournament for 
the first time, qualified for their initial NCAA Tournament berth and won a 
game before bowing to top-seeded Arizona. Already this season they have won 13 
games, climbed into the Top 10 in the wire-service polls and knocked off 
perennial power Georgetown before the largest crowd ever to witness a college 
basketball game in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The 19,761 fans at Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford Tuesday night 
represented a triumph for Carlesimo as well as a breakthrough for the Big East. 
Speaking from Syracuse, where he was scouting the Pirates' next opponent 
against Pittsburgh, the coach was ecstatic about the turnout. "In the long 
run," he said, "I think it's more significant than the result of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Although the 94-86 victory enabled Seton Hall to remain tied with another 
upstart, Providence, for first place in the conference, it was only one step in 
a long, competitive season. But the size of the crowd offered irrefutable proof 
that after decades of virtual anonymity, the program had arrived as a presence 
in Eastern basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't as if there was nothing else going on," Carlesimo said, "and we got 
all the basketball junkies. The Knicks were playing the Celtics at the Garden 
before 19,500. The timing was right. We caught Georgetown undefeated and we had 
that great start. But it was still mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall was not a prime candidate when the conference was formed in 1979. 
Organizers wanted Rutgers, but when New Jersey's state university hesitated, 
the Pirates were invited to join. The Hall's rich basketball tradition, like 
the trophies and old pictures in Walsh Auditorium, had been gathering dust. "We 
were good in the '60s," Carlesimo noted last year. "We were great in the '50s. 
Kids don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
When Carlesimo arrived on the campus in the fourth year of Big East play, there 
was no basketball secretary, no full-time assistants. "I remember how proud we 
were just to get four permanent side baskets in the gymnasium," he said. At 
first, the school didn't have the resources to compete. The construction of 
Meadowlands Arena presented Seton Hall with a chance to follow the conference's 
growing demands and to show a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"It has saved our program in a lot of ways," the coach said. As the Pirates 
registered moderate gains in attendance, Carlesimo recalled, "We would brag 
about drawing more than five or six teams. I'd play that game all the time. St. 
John's would fill Alumni Hall with 6,000 and the same would be true in 
Pittsburgh. Even Providence didn't have that many seats. We'd brag about 
12,000, but all the while there would be 7,000 or 8,000 empty seats." 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday. That night, the Pirates were as big a draw as the Knicks and 
Celtics just a few miles away. As was the case with the conference, Seton 
Hall's location in the New York metropolitan area was both an asset and a 
disadvantage. The disadvantage was the fierce competition for media attention 
and fan interest in a region populated by so many professional teams and 
dominated, in the sphere of college basketball, by St. John's. The extent of 
the asset was obvious against Georgetown. Thousands of people and tremendous 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Carlesimo knows all about the territory. He was a player and an assistant coach 
at Fordham in the Bronx before building the program at Wagner on Staten Island. 
While at Wagner, he came within a last-second jump shot of beating St. John's 
in the ECAC postseason playoffs. A Carlesimo team finally succeeded in besting 
the Redmen last month, and at Alumni Hall.

CYNICISM AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Breaking Camp: Concerns for Health Force Migrants Out" (Dec. 18) 
raises the obvious question of whose health we are interested in? 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that the mechanisms to promote health in San Diego are being used 
to destroy the only homes people have. We consider it a very cynical use of a 
public agency for the Health Department to enforce the wishes of those who want 
the camps out of their backyard. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious to us as members of a public health-oriented discipline that if 
as a society we say we are concerned about health, we must meet the challenge 
of providing adequate housing and sanitary conditions for those who earn a 
substandard wage. As pointed out in the article, the people living in the camps 
work hard and many are legal U. S. residents. Razing the camps will displace 
the symptoms of the problem, it is not a solution.

CAN WE FINALLY HONOR DR. KING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the 60th birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. draws near, the San 
Diego City Council has the opportunity to give the slain civil rights leader an 
early birthday present by voting Tuesday to name the city's new convention 
center for him. 
</P>
<P>
If the San Diego Unified Port District, which is building the convention 
center, also approves the name, San Diego will have gone a long way toward 
clearing the debris of the citizen initiative that stripped King's name from a 
major downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's checkered history in trying to establish a public tribute to 
King, there will still be those who try to persuade the council and the port 
commissioners that the convention center is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the commission should ignore those voices. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasing everyone is not the point. There is no building or street that would 
not generate criticism. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is that the country's seventh-largest city has no major 
public tribute to the man who probably did more for civil rights than anyone 
since Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for San Diego's leaders to show some of the conviction of the 
man they are trying to honor. 
</P>
<P>
Already, too much time has passed; King was slain in 1968. Already, the city 
has earned an embarrassing reputation for racism. Two attempts to name streets 
here for King have failed; first, when the council rejected a proposal to 
rename part of Euclid Avenue and 54th Street, and again when the voters 
reversed the council's decision to rename Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to name the convention center for King was made by a 
council-appointed citizens committee that worked for almost a year, holding 
hearings throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the Port District should wholeheartedly endorse the committee's 
recommendation -- and not dilute it by using only King's last name, as 
Councilman Wes Pratt suggested in an attempt to fend off opposition. 
</P>
<P>
We also urge the council to approve a Chamber of Commerce proposal to establish 
a memorial to King in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the memorials would make a strong statement that the city recognizes 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s profound and courageous contribution to this and every 
community.

THE WRONG CHOICE BY KING COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some time ago, a group of community leaders began a quest to honor the civil 
rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Out of this noble intention grew the 
embarrassment of Market Street, in which citizens petitioned and overturned the 
City Council's decision to rename the street for Dr. King. Angered and more 
determined, this group began a catharsis in the form of a committee, the Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Committee, to seek out a new, and perhaps better 
and more successful effort, to honor Dr. King. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first tasks was to outline the details to be considered if the goal 
was to be reached. Given priority was the agreement not to change the name of 
anything. Instead, the committee decided something new should be created. 
Meetings were held, politicians pursued, support from the business community 
garnered and opinions sought. 
</P>
<P>
The task must have been too formidable for the committee. Instead of something 
really creative and unique, the easier, less costly route of renaming the 
convention center was decided. No money needed to be raised, total community 
consensus could be bypassed and the committee didn't have to get it built or 
decide what it should look like. It was just a simple matter of a name change. 
To do that, all they needed was to lobby the San Diego Unified Port District, 
acting as the developer of the structure, and the City Council, acting as the 
tenant and operator. 
</P>
<P>
The convention center was named more than two years ago as a part of the lease 
between the port and the city. That name, San Diego Convention Center, was 
decided after much thought. The center's purpose is to attract conventions that 
bolster our economy. An easy-to-say name that clearly identifies the community 
is a marketing plus. To that end, San Diego has already spent two years and 
almost $2 million promoting the San Diego Convention Center name across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The Dr. King memorial committee must have been oblivious to the simple fact 
that, not only does the center already have a name, but that a great effort has 
already been made to promote that name. They probably knew but decided to go 
for the name change anyway. It certainly makes their task easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Committee should be challenged to spend 
the 10 years that the visitor industry spent to get the convention center built 
to arrive at its goal. Its challenge is to develop a new, original memorial to 
Dr. King, not to steal another group's project.

<P>
MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS DELIVERING A DISSERVICE THROUGH UNNECESSARY CESAREANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DORIS A. FULLER, Doris A. Fuller, the secretary of CPM of San Diego, is a La 
Jolla marketing consultant and former Times staff writer. Her second child, 
Natalie, was born vaginally at a hospital outside San Diego County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like one out of every four women who gives birth each year in San Diego County, 
I gave birth to my first child by Cesarean section in 1983. Like virtually all 
of those women, I believed it was the best thing for me and my child. 
</P>
<P>
And, like at least half of those women, I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of vaginal birth that my reputable, trusted doctor so vividly 
detailed were unsupported in the medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
The frightening statistics he quoted were false. 
</P>
<P>
The Cesarean panacea he described was a fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
A baby was born, but truth was aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Many obstetricians, who find Cesarean delivery lucrative and convenient and who 
consider it the ultimate answer to the malpractice threat, find it persuasive 
to exaggerate the dangers of normal delivery and downplay the risks of surgical 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it. The only difference between vaginal birth and Cesarean birth is 
a couple days of discomfort," Dr. Robert Resnik, chairman of the reproductive 
medicine department at UC San Diego School of Medicine, told the San Diego 
Birth Forum during a panel discussion of Cesarean birth. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes such as this are commonplace in obstetrics, and they help explain why 
the Cesarean rate in San Diego County is 25.3%, a record surpassed in Southern 
California by only one other county. (Nationwide, Cesarean sections have 
quintupled since 1970, reaching 24.1% of all births, without any corresponding 
reduction in infant death rates.) 
</P>
<P>
At Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, roughly four out of 10 pregnant women 
who walk through the door are delivered by surgery, according to state figures. 
At Sharp Memorial Hospital, the number is three in 10. At a total of 13 county 
hospitals, the Cesarean rate exceeds 20% -- twice what many authorities say is 
justifiable medically. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors who decry these trends, who approach birth as a natural event rather 
than a medical episode, are suspect in San Diego's conservative medical 
community. Some have left to practice elsewhere. Those who remain try to 
practice without notice. 
</P>
<P>
They and parents who dare to question the Cesarean trend face the same taunt: 
If healthy babies are born, what difference does it make how they're delivered? 
As Dr. Resnik would say, is anything more at stake than a couple days of 
discomfort? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is medical. Nearly half of all women undergoing Cesarean section 
experience complications from the surgery. Some of these complications are 
minor ones, such as gastrointestinal distress. Others are major, such as 
hemorrhage. Cesarean birth is a major surgical procedure that carries with it 
major surgical risks that do not accompany vaginal birth. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is ethical. Medical literature is unequivocal about the superior 
safety of vaginal delivery in general and of vaginal delivery for women who 
have previously had Cesarean deliveries in particular. Even the conservative 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advocates vaginal births 
after Cesarean sections. Doctors who continue to perform Cesarean sections on 
20%, 30%, 40% or more of the first-time mothers they see and 90% or more of the 
prior Cesarean mothers are knowingly putting their patients in jeopardy without 
medical justification. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is economical. Cesarean delivery costs more than twice what 
vaginal delivery costs. Ralph Nader's Public Citizens Health Research Group has 
estimated that unnecessary Cesareans cost three quarters of a billion dollars 
annually. Unnecessary Cesareans affect more than parents and babies; they touch 
every individual or employer who pays an insurance premium. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is practical. Cesarean recovery is slower, involves a longer 
hospital stay, entails more pain, requires more medication, necessitates more 
help back at home, results in longer maternity leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is emotional. Many women suffer feelings of anger, failure, 
disappointment, grief or violation as a result of their Cesarean births, and 
some have trouble bonding with their babies. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Cesarean delivery can be a lifesaving procedure for 
mother and/or child. But it is also beyond reason that one out of four births 
would end badly if a surgeon did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
I was one of those women who got angry. Disappointed that I experienced birth 
strapped to an operating table, my body numb, the wound and delivery hidden 
from my view; upset that my baby's birth date was determined by my doctor's 
meeting schedule; outraged that my infant son, Gregory, was yanked into the 
world an estimated two weeks before he was ready, I began to study. 
</P>
<P>
Having studied, I learned that my Cesarean was not medically necessary and, in 
fact -- because it was scheduled and took place before labor began -- put my 
son at risk for complications. 
</P>
<P>
While I'm not one normally drawn to causes, what I learned galvanized me into 
action and I joined the San Diego chapter of the national Cesarean Prevention 
Movement. Begun in 1982 by Esther Zorn to combat the tide of unnecessary 
Cesareans and to give special support to mothers seeking a vaginal birth after 
Cesarean, CPM has 70 chapters in 31 states and members in six other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old San Diego chapter is still small, but, as the parent group 
declares, "We are making a difference." 
</P>
<P>
We are identifying those local physicians who are enthusiastic about normal, 
vaginal birth, and helping women to find them, even if it means changing 
doctors very late in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
We are lobbying hospitals to cease those practices that promote surgical birth 
and to implement policies that facilitate normal birth, and we have seen 
changes in their policies as a result. 
</P>
<P>
We are providing literature, referrals, counsel and support to women from 
throughout the county who want nothing more than to bear children without 
medical interference. 
</P>
<P>
And we are making a difference in individual lives. While fewer than than one 
in 10 Cesarean mothers nationwide deliver subsequent infants vaginally, more 
than nine in 10 of those who have been counseled by CPM of San Diego complete a 
vaginal delivery after a Cesarean. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, when a watershed study reported a Chicago hospital's successful 
effort to slash its Cesarean rate by doing little more than requiring outside 
second opinions in all non-emergency Cesareans and instituting rigorous peer 
review of all C-sections, we challenged local hospitals to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
We as consumers are doing what we can to stem the Cesarean tide. Now it's the 
medical community's turn. If prospective parents were accurately informed about 
the differences between Cesarean and vaginal delivery, medical research has 
documented that fewer would consent to Cesarean delivery. 
</P>
<P>
We think it's time for doctors to start delivering truth as well as babies.

JONES SHOOTS 72 BUT UPS LEAD TO 2 AT LA COSTA

<P>
Weather has become a factor in the 37th MONY Tournament of Champions at La 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
It was windy, cold and damp on Friday and it was just plain nasty Saturday, 
when a mid-afternoon rain made playing conditions difficult for the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were no real surprises on the leader board, although Steve Jones 
said he was surprised that he was still leading. 
</P>
<P>
Jones started the day 6 under par, with a 1-stroke lead over Chip Beck. He was 
still 6 under par at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, though, Jones fell 3 strokes behind Beck, his playing partner. 
However, Jones birdied the 14th, 15th and 16th holes, bogeyed the 17th and came 
in at 72. 
</P>
<P>
Beck faltered with a 40 on the back 9 for a 74 and a 54-hole total of 213, the 
same as Sandy Lyle. Jones, at 210, has a 2-stroke lead over Ben Crenshaw and 
Lanny Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
Also in contention going into the final round today are Bob Lohr, David Frost, 
Jay Haas and Jeff Sluman at 214; Bill Glasson and Greg Norman at 215, and 
Curtis Strange, Tom Sieckmann and Mark Calcavecchia at 216. 
</P>
<P>
So there are 13 pros within 6 shots of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that no one has made a move up to now," Jones said. "Tomorrow, 
someone will probably make a move, and I hope it's me." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a first-time qualifier for this tournament, has held up under the 
pressure, even though he has only one career victory on the tour, the AT&amp;T 
Pebble Beach Pro-Am last year. 
</P>
<P>
He made a comeback on the back side after his driver betrayed him. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver is no longer in my bag," said Jones, who changed drivers Saturday 
and used the club only 5 times. 
</P>
<P>
He has 3 drivers with him and has already used 2 without any appreciable 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"I've hit it straight, I've hit it to the left and I've hit it to the right," 
Jones said of his errant drives. "I just didn't know where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that driving is usually the strongest part of his game, so he's 
compensating with solid iron play and chipping. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he chipped into the hole from about 40 feet for his birdie on No. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I'm happy. I'm getting a lot out of my game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw and Wadkins, both veterans, are in a favorable position. Crenshaw shot 
a 2-under-par 70 Saturday after taking a triple-bogey 8 on the par-5 17th hole 
Friday and winding up with a 72. Wadkins has been steady with rounds of 71, 70 
and 71. 
</P>
<P>
Glasson had the best round of the day, coming in at 67, and finishing just 
before it began to rain. 
</P>
<P>
He was 5 under par for the last 5 holes. He birdied No. 14 and 15 and then got 
an eagle on the par-4, 423-yard 16th with a driver and a 4-iron that took one 
bounce on the green and went into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Glasson had a par on No. 17, missing a 6-foot putt for a birdie, and then sank 
a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was an unusual par on No. 13, after 2 successive bogeys, 
that got him going. His drive landed against a tree. So, on his second shot, he 
turned his 8-iron over and hit it left-handed 100 yards down the fairway. Then 
he hit a wedge to the green and made the par-saving putt. 
</P>
<P>
It's not inconceivable that Strange could be challenging for the lead. He has 
made startling charges in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, the PGA player of the year and the leading money-winner in 1988, had a 
77 Thursday when he 4-putted on the first hole. Then he shot a 70 and a 69 and 
is just 6 strokes behind Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw said that mud was a problem Saturday on second and approach shots, 
making a swing an unexpected adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Mud was his undoing Friday when he put successive shots in a lake bordering the 
17th fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"As the joke goes, it was a good 8," Crenshaw said of his triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins said he thought he was dressed too warmly at the outset of his round, 
when the sun was shining. But he appreciated that comfort on the last 3 holes 
when rain drenched the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just cold, windy and damp, and the ball picks up a lot of mud," he 
said. "Patience is the big thing this week." 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins, who won the Tournament of Champions in 1982 and 1983, was fairly 
satisfied with his round of 71, which included 3 birdies and 2 bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I played that great, but I hung in there," Wadkins said. 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the key word for this tournament, with the weather being so 
capricious. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Magee, the first-day leader at 68, hasn't been able to hang in there. He 
has had successive rounds of 75 and 79.

CINCINNATI'S ROADBLOCKS TO KEEP BILLS BUSY TODAY 
</P>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to the Jungle, where they have fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
The Jungle is where the Bengals roar, and the elephants in the offensive line 
conga, and the Ickey shuffles. 
</P>
<P>
And the Buffalo roam? 
</P>
<P>
Not without an upset. 
</P>
<P>
The Jungle is Riverfront Stadium, site of today's American Football Conference 
championship between the Bengals and Bills, combatants who are almost mirror 
images of each other. They are young teams that had hot starts (11-1 for the 
Bills, 7-1 for the Bengals) and slower finishes (1-3 and no road victory since 
Nov. 14 for the Bills, 5-3 for the Bengals). 
</P>
<P>
The Bills had a great defense and an efficient (No. 11 in the league) offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had a great offense and a fair (No. 15) defense. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team lost a home game, which is where the Jungle comes in, making the 
Bengals a solid four-point pick. They're not in Buffalo anymore, Toto. 
</P>
<P>
The home-field advantage is not to be discounted in postseason, where it seems 
to count for even more. According to Mort Oldshan's Gold Sheet, home teams are 
58-26 since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bills have more problems facing them than that. 
</P>
<P>
Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bengals' running game. They flattened the Bills, 232 yards' worth, in 
their Nov. 27 meeting, and they hit Seattle for 254 last week. If they can 
manage 150 today, they will thwart the basic Bill game plan, which counts on 
controlling the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bills' rushing defense. Inside linebacker Shane Conlan says his injured 
arch has improved enough for him to start, but Coach Marv Levy notes that 
Conlan has played only one quarter in 6 weeks. Without Conlan, and with Art 
Still, Fred Smerlas and Darryl Talley hurting too, the Bills dropped in the 
last month from No. 6 against the rush to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hot Bengal quarterback. The problems Jim Kelly has had this season? 
Boomer Esiason had that season a year ago, when his touchdown pass-interception 
ratio was 16 to 19 and he was almost booed out of town. This season, Boomer 
turned it back around and went 28-14, to Kelly's 15-17. 
</P>
<P>
And now for Classic Matchup II, the Bengal offense vs. the Bill defense, with 
the winner, in all probability, going to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Classic Matchup I didn't go so well for the Bills, who gave up 149 yards 
rushing in the first half and lost the battle for time of possession, 41:21 to 
18:39. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed us," said Smerlas, the Bills' Pro Bowl nose tackle. "I felt like I 
was playing under Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a lot of credibility. You know, the classic matchup, the No. 1 offense 
against the great defense, and they ran through us like we were Swiss cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think if we'd had everybody (Conlan and cornerback Derrick Burroughs 
were out and Talley, a fine run defender, was lost early), we could have 
stopped them. They were running left, right, up the middle, passing. They did 
everything they wanted to against our defense, which we weren't accustomed to. 
They were just on, and we weren't." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have nice backs: big, fast, boogalooing Ickey Woods, and smaller, 
faster James Brooks, but the key is left tackle Anthony Munoz, the former 
Trojan who is matched today against right end Bruce Smith in your basic duel of 
titans. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz is the line's kingpin. Some critics consider it to be large -- 280 pounds 
a man -- but ordinary, except for the all-world Munoz, who takes it to another 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Others consider the line to be a good cut above that. In any case, it's a load. 
</P>
<P>
"They're huge," Smerlas says. "They come out and they maul you. 
</P>
<P>
"They try and get the corner on you. They push you by the hole -- or lock you 
up and let the back make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"What they do, they create a new line of scrimmage with their size. If you 
start trying to run with them laterally, they push you 3-4 yards back, and the 
back can dive for 4 yards. Or if your 'backers pursue straight down the line, 
they have the great cutback ability, Ickey Woods and Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way you go, they're tough to defense. They're so strong, they can lock 
you up at the line of scrimmage. Their backs are so smart, if the backside 
'backers aren't staying home, they'll cut it back and made the big, big play 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the great offensive line that has the quickness to cut you off and 
the backs to pick the holes. They legitimately are the best offense in the 
NFL." 
</P>
<P>
However, the classic matchup is only half the battle, if the most important 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Can Kelly rise above his sea of troubles? 
</P>
<P>
Can the Bengal defense contain him? 
</P>
<P>
In the first meeting, the Bengals took a 21-0 lead . . . and Kelly, unfazed as 
ever, led a rally to within 28-21 early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were driving again until Robb Riddick fumbled at the Cincinnati 35. 
The Bengals then drove 65 yards the other way for a 35-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Things being what they were, pregame discussion centered around Bengal Coach 
Sam Wyche's fast one -- his no-huddle "attack" offense. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Seattle got around it by having nose tackle Joe Nash feign 
injuries, which allowed the Seahawks to get their nickel backs and extra pass 
rushers. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche indignantly dubbed it "the big Nash attack." Of course, it was Wyche who 
started this; why not just line up and play the game, like everyone else? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Levy last week accused the Bengals of having 12 or 13 players at a time 
on the field, making it impossible to counter-substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Wyche: "Tell him to check the films." 
</P>
<P>
Then Wyche called Levy and pledged to play fair. 
</P>
<P>
And Levy said he would, too -- as long as he had a chance to get the right 
personnel on the field. 
</P>
<P>
And Wyche said, well, he couldn't promise they wouldn't snap the ball on quick 
counts now and then. 
</P>
<P>
With luck, they'll get it sorted out in time to have a football game, too.

His last name is Green, his favorite color is blue, and he thinks the 
importance attached to golf's 4 major championships is a "figment of the 
media's imagination, Jack Nicklaus' imagination and a few other golfers." 
</P>
<P>
His first name is not Hubert. It's Ken. He is not a doll, although he does get 
wound up. Last year he broke five clubs. On the course. 
</P>
<P>
Green is not a clone, either. Or anything else you might expect from the PGA's 
sanitized conveyor belt, which for years has threatened to turn pro golf into 
Blonds R Us. 
</P>
<P>
He wears his glasses thick, his dark hair short, his baggy pants pleated and 
his heart on his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks his mind when asked. And when not asked. 
</P>
<P>
He is 30 and the winner of more than $1 million worldwide in 1988, when he 
finished first in eagles, fifth in putting, 11th in scoring and fourth on the 
PGA money list. 
</P>
<P>
He is part Tommy Bolt, part Mac O'Grady and part Thomas Paine, the early 
American author of "Common Sense" who once said, "Character is much easier kept 
than recovered." 
</P>
<P>
But mostly Green is himself. 
</P>
<P>
Said Paul Azinger, the PGA's player of the year in 1987: "A lot of guys are one 
way in a practice round and another way on camera. Ken Green is the same way. 
And he doesn't care what anybody thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is competing here this weekend in the MONY Tournament of Champions 
at La Costa, Green is never far in spirit from his home in Danbury, Conn. His 
regular caddy, Joe LaCava, from nearby Newtown, is his cousin. Before that, his 
caddy for 2 1/2 years was his sister, Shelly, who used to say you could tell 
her from the other bag-toters by her blue eye-liner. 
</P>
<P>
Green's initial reaction to Augusta National, golf's Sistine Chapel, was as 
unpredictable as his temper. After firing a first-round 68 for a share of the 
early lead at the 1986 Masters, he said: "I am not impressed with Magnolia 
Lane." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was first-degree blasphemy. It is now almost 3 years later, 
but he refuses to back off. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more drives in Connecticut that are a hell of a lot more 
prettier than Magnolia Lane was," he said Wednesday. "That's my honest opinion. 
I get a lot of abuse sometimes for the things I say. But that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if somebody watches me for 18 holes, they're going to talk 
about that when they go home. Some people are going to enjoy what I do, they're 
going to enjoy the golf, they're going to enjoy my comments, they're going to 
enjoy me flipping the ball around or the club around. Other people are going to 
hate it, and they're going tell all their friends what a terrible young man I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
Before the tournament here began, they threw a press conference for Arnold 
Palmer, a man the other players still refer to as "the King." Palmer benignly 
held court on subjects ranging from putting, course conditions and confidence 
to the recent dominance over Americans by the Europeans in Ryder Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans have worked a little harder," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
That rankled Green. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing going on right now about the Europeans knowing how to win, or 
working harder, or wanting to win versus Americans is such a crock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I never knew you could compare players on the basis of alternate 
shots or best ball (the Ryder format). I don't believe that's how you determine 
who the best players in the world are. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is Arnold's way or Jack's way to give us (the Americans) a little 
push to play better. But it's a crock." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, says Green, is the criticism leveled at the U.S. tour for its failure 
to produce a dominant player. Curtis Strange, he points out, has won the money 
title 3 of the last 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What do they expect?" Green asks. "Four out of four? Jack never did that. What 
Curtis has done should shut everybody up. But it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Let's quickly review the bidding here: Magnolia Lane is unimpressive. Arnold 
Palmer's proclamations on European golfers are a crock. Female caddies are all 
right. Breaking clubs is honest emotion. And the majors are a figment of Jack 
Nicklaus' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a world right now where, as golfers go, supposedly there's no one out 
there that has a personality or any color," Green says. "Then, if you find 
someone that's a little radical, he gets criticized for being radical. It's a 
no-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of the golf world eyes Green warily. The feeling is mutual. 
He is perched on the precipice of its Establishment, and he isn't sure whether 
the next step is up or down. 
</P>
<P>
"We're incredibly spoiled," he says of professional golfers, too many of whom 
get bent out of shape when the courtesy car and keys aren't waiting at the 
airport each week. 
</P>
<P>
Green rented his car this week. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to give the courtesy cars to the guys who just came out of the 
qualifying school," he says. "Those are the guys who need to save 200 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Is Ken Green good for golf? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Azinger says. "I wouldn't say, 'Hey, he's definitely good for 
golf.' I wouldn't say he's terrible for golf, either." 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, the golfing Establishment hasn't quite figured out what to make of Ken 
Green. He is consistent in his ability to defy prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Green is as unpredictable as the weather," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Azinger added, Green is immensely talented. Long enough off the tee to 
rank 27th among the tour's drivers. Delicate enough around the greens to have 
finished 13th in sand saves and second last year in the overall category that 
combines all the tour's statistical departments. And confident enough now to 
finish first regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"He could win 7 tournaments out here this year," Azinger said, matter of 
factly. 
</P>
<P>
It's even fun to watch Green practice. On the chipping green, he will wedge a 
handful of balls near the cup, then, without picking them up, feather them back 
into the rough 10 yards away. He takes a full swing that touches nothing but 
the ball, which arcs softly before plopping back into the long grass. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger remembers the days when he used to play practice rounds with Green and 
Green's good friend Mark Calcavecchia. Before teeing off, Calcavecchia and 
Green would stand around, dreaming up wild wagers, such as putting a ball on 
top of a stake 3 feet off the ground and laying 7-1 odds on $10 that they could 
chip it into a bucket 40 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"Innovative," Azinger said. "They've got imaginations. They didn't always wedge 
it into the bucket. But that's just the way they were, always making crazy 
bets. But paying up when they lost." 
</P>
<P>
CBS announcer Gary McCord nicknamed Green "Flipper" when Green started 
nonchalantly tossing his putter to LaCava after making putts. The two have 
perfected their act to the point where Green doesn't even look for LaCava 
anymore before flipping the putter behind his back or over his shoulder. LaCava 
says he hasn't dropped one yet during a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Good-hands people," Green says. 
</P>
<P>
Green won his first 1988 tournament, the Canadian Open, in September. The next 
week at Milwaukee, he shot a 61 on Saturday, equaling the lowest round on tour 
all year, and eventually won by 6 strokes. This despite chest pains and 
dizziness on Sunday that almost forced him to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"On about the sixth hole, he turned to me and said, 'I don't know if I'm going 
to be able to finish this thing,' " LaCava said. "I told him, 'You'd better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Green did. A cardiologist later diagnosed the problem as a pinched nerve or 
muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
So Green kept playing. Two weeks after Milwaukee, he finished sixth at 
Endicott, N.Y. Then he was second at Pensacola, Fla. Then 12th at Orlando, Fla. 
Then fourth at Tucson. Then third in the Nabisco at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Four times in 1988, Green earned 6-figure paychecks. Then he jetted to Japan, 
where he won $221,000 by finishing first in the Dunlop Phoenix. His U.S. tour 
earnings in 1988 were $779,180. The victory in Japan pushed him over the 
million-dollar mark, an accomplishment obscured when Strange became the first 
player to make more than a million in a year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible stretch," Green says. "Yet I think I should have won 6 
tournaments instead of 3." 
</P>
<P>
All this from a golfer who failed twice to get his tour card and had to enroll 
in the PGA's qualifying school three more times before graduating for good in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Green finished 156th on the money list with earnings of $20,160. To 
put that in perspective, LaCava made almost 3 times that much carrying Green's 
bag in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It (1984) was probably my nightmare," Green says. "It was scary. Everything 
was a disaster. My personal life was splitso. My golf was psycho. It was just a 
combination of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Golf, his first love, was no longer fun. But he decided he would give it one 
more shot. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Green bounced back and won $151,355 and the first of his 4 PGA Tour 
titles, the Buick Open at Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he found Ellen Targett, who would soon become his second wife. "She 
gets a ton of credit from me," Green says. "If you want to have a good life on 
tour, you've got to have a good wife. It was like in the movies when you fall 
so much in love with somebody that it makes such a difference. It's like Bing 
Crosby and Dorothy Lamour all over. But it's real." 
</P>
<P>
So are the dollars they're paying him to play a sport that most others pay 
their own money to play when they aren't working. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget how lucky we are," Green says. "Other golfers forget how lucky 
we are. It can be difficult out here. And you can bitch and moan. But a day 
doesn't go by out here where I don't think I'm a lucky person."

LOU HOLTZ: COUNTRY BOY MAKES GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

TEMPE, Ariz.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lou Holtz can aw-shucks with the best of them. Raised up (that's how they say 
it) in a part of Ohio that more closely resembles West Virginia, he learned to 
talk the way all football coaches seem to talk, which is to say country. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the only people in the world who say criminy -- also, my golly -- 
are football coaches and certain elderly, Southern librarians who wear their 
hair in a bun. You suspect Holtz would talk that way if he had been born in 
Gotham itself. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why you had to laugh, just a little, when Holtz, having won himself a 
national championship, talked of always dreaming about coaching at Notre Dame 
but never, my golly, letting himself quite believe the dream could come true. 
At the close of the Fiesta Bowl Monday night, Holtz said the job was "for movie 
stars" and not for the likes of him, an old country boy. 
</P>
<P>
You laughed because you knew that, for years, Holtz had put escape clauses in 
his contracts, allowing him to leave his position if Notre Dame ever called, or 
hollered. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, as the Gerry Faust era came crashing to a close, Notre Dame 
went looking for someone who could return the school to its past glory and 
settled on Holtz, known equally for his country-boy savvy and for winning 
football games. It was also suggested that he would retain the proper respect 
for Notre Dame academic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
And now, it has happened, the first Notre Dame championship since 1977, an 
epoch by Irish standards, and there is the inevitable self-congratulation for 
which Notre Dame is also famous. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what is good and right in America," said Andy Heck, an All-American 
offensive tackle. "Notre Dame being No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, the Irish were coming off consecutive 5-6 seasons and 
nothing was good or right in America. Now, they're 12-0 and winners of either 
their eighth or 11th national title, depending on who is doing the counting. 
(Notre Dame claims three in the days before wire-service polls.) 
</P>
<P>
In either case, it was Holtz's first, and he would admit that he wasn't quite 
sure, after 19 years as a head coach, if he knew how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no Barry Switzer," he had said earlier in the week. "This sucker's new to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
He is no Barry Switzer, and we can be thankful for that. In Notre Dame, we have 
a national champion worthy of the honor. In these times where the concept of 
student-athlete is the basic dictionary definition of oxymoron, Notre Dame 
stands out like a gold helmet. Once again, it has graduated all its football 
seniors. Since 1981, when the College Football Association began awarding 
honors for graduation rates, Notre Dame has won five times. Duke and Virginia, 
not exactly football powerhouses, have won twice apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Would you rather the champion had emerged from the depths of the Citrus Bowl, 
where Clemson and Oklahoma were playing? Is that what college football is all 
about? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's easier at Notre Dame, it being Notre Dame. People want to go 
there. There is that tradition. There are those ghosts. Just as Holtz dreamed 
of coaching there, a million kids across America dream of playing there. But no 
one ever dreamed the Irish could be as hopelessly mediocre as they were in the 
five years of Gerry Faust, who was a very nice man but a very bad wizard. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz, as you might have heard, is an amateur magician, but he is a very 
professional football coach. Even under Faust, Notre Dame always attracted good 
players, and now the Irish have someone who can make something of the stew. The 
bigger problem was in forcing Holtz to admit he had any players at all. 
</P>
<P>
For the entire week before the big game, when hype makes right, Holtz had 
underplayed his team, not unlike a hustler in a pool hall, suggesting that his 
team won with a combination of grit and luck and perhaps a modicum of skill. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my," he said. "We've really got some problems on our team." 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, folks, when Holtz took the job, he foresaw just this scenario -- 
winning a championship and then being expected to repeat. He said he wanted 
Notre Dame to reach the point where it could be ranked No. 1 and no one would 
even notice. That's the way it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as though it could be that way again.

AGENT SAYS MANNING IS OUT, BUT CLIPPERS UNCERTAIN 
</P>

<P>
While the Clippers continue their wait-and-see vigil on the future of Danny 
Manning, speculation continues that the star rookie is heading for major knee 
surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Manning injured his right knee late in the first quarter of Wednesday night's 
game at Milwaukee. It was initially diagnosed by Dr. David Haskell, the Bucks' 
orthopedic consultant, as a hyper-extension. Upon returning to Los Angeles, 
however, Dr. Tony Daly, the Clipper team physician, reported there was a tear 
in one of the knee's main ligaments, the anterior cruciate. 
</P>
<P>
The only question remaining was how serious the tear was, and that much won't 
be determined until Monday or Tuesday, when the swelling in the knee is 
expected to have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
In a worst-case scenario, the injury is one of the most serious a basketball 
player can suffer, similar to one that sidelined former Laker Mitch Kupchak and 
Bernard King, now of the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Grinker, Manning's Cincinnati-based agent, said the worst is expected, that 
the upcoming examinations may only be a formality. 
</P>
<P>
"As of right now, I've been told by Dr. Daly that Danny is not going to play 
any more this year," Grinker said. "We didn't discuss what the rest of the year 
meant, whether it's the rest of the season, the rest of the calendar year or 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny doesn't think it's short term at all. Danny's a man. He knows what the 
situation is. There's no secrets. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, that's not the case and no one is sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
Daly, however, said Friday night that no diagnosis has been made on the 
seriousness of the injury to the National Basketball Assn.'s No. 1 draft pick 
of 1988 and the college basketball player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't decided that," Daly said of Grinker's claims. "It could be true. 
I'm doing another MRI (magnetic resonance imaging, a sort of computer-enhanced 
X-ray) Tuesday. At that time, I will make a final determination. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely something in there (the knee). I don't know how bad yet." 
</P>
<P>
Grinker also said he will have another doctor perform the operation, if one is 
needed. He refused to comment why, but he reportedly has been unhappy with some 
of the previous work by Daly, a respected doctor within U.S. amateur athletics 
and the chief medical officer for the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee 
in conjunction with the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
But exactly when Grinker and Manning will select another doctor is unsure. 
</P>
<P>
"At the right time," Grinker said. "When we have all the information." 
</P>
<P>
Manning is not taking phone calls at his Hermosa Beach home. His only statement 
came Thursday and was released through the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in better spirits, but I'm not going to jump to any conclusions," he 
said. "I'll just try to prepare myself for whatever happens." 
</P>
<P>
In 26 games since joining the Clippers after a holdout, Manning emerged as one 
of the leading candidates for rookie of the year and had become one of the 
major factors as the Clippers reached the 10-victory plateau 3 weeks earlier 
than last season. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 16.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists and has started 17 
games. Moreover, in the 5 outings before the Milwaukee game, Manning's numbers 
were 20.8 points and 8.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing was he allowed me to do certain things with the team," said 
Coach Gene Shue, whose team plays the New York Knicks tonight at Madison Square 
Garden. "I was able to experiment using two big guards at the same time in the 
lineup -- Quintin (Dailey) and Reggie (Williams) . . . That's because Danny 
handles the ball so well. He just adds another dimension to the entire team."

VERSACE SHOWS PACERS HOW TO BEAT UP ON PISTONS, 113-99 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a former assistant with the Detroit Pistons, Dick Versace, now coach of 
the Indiana Pacers, would know more than most about how to deal with his former 
club. 
</P>
<P>
But beating the Pistons would nevertheless seem an unlikely accomplishment 
considering the Pacers' 7-23 record going into Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Pacers beat the Pistons, they did it convincingly at 
Indianapolis, 113-99, behind Chuck Pearson's 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
It was their third straight victory, the second under Versace, who was hired 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The lads did a nice job in a short period of time in absorbing a lot I threw 
at them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, leading from the opening minutes, built a 15-point lead after 3 
quarters and widened it to 19 midway through the final period before Detroit 
rallied in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas made 2 free throws and a basket, and another basket by Joe Dumars 
cut the Pacers' lead to 102-94 with 2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's Vern Fleming, playing for the first time since missing 6 games with 
an ankle injury, made a 3-point play, and Wayman Tisdale and Scott Skiles added 
4 points apiece in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 104, New York 96 -- Larry Nance blocked a team-record 11 shots and 
scored 24 points, while Ron Harper had 30 points and 11 rebounds as the 
Cavaliers ran their winning streak to 11 games by beating the Knicks at 
Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, troubled in the first half by the Knicks' trapping defense, 
turned up their defensive pressure to hold off a New York rally in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland blocked 21 shots, also a team record, including 4 quick blocks after 
the Knicks got ro within 97-92 with just over 4 minutes left. Nance, whose 11 
blocked shots are a career high, blocked 3 shots on consecutive New York 
possessions late in the game, and Harper blocked Mark Jackson's layup with 2 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 107, Washington 104 -- Rex Chapman made a 3-point shot with 10 
seconds left and Michael Holton added 2 free throws with 1 second remaining as 
the Hornets held off the Bullets at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, 1-14 on the road, improved to 8-8 at home. 
</P>
<P>
After Chapman's 3-pointer put Charlotte ahead, 105-101, Ledell Eackles 
responded with a 3-pointer with 7 seconds left to get the Bullets within 1, but 
Holton's free throws clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 96, Houston 95 -- Hersey Hawkins made a 3-point shot at the 
buzzer, leading the 76ers over the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins took an inbounds pass with 1 second remaining, turned toward the basket 
and shot as the game ended. Hawkins made 12 of 18 shots and finished with a 
season-high 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-foot baseline jumper by Akeem Olajuwon gave the Rockets a 95-93 lead with 
9 seconds left. Philadelphia's Charles Barkley drove the lane, but his shot 
fell short and Mike Gminski fell to the floor, grabbed the rebound and called 
timeout for the 76ers, who snapped a 4-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 107, Utah 89 -- Terry Cummings scored 25 points and Ricky Pierce had 
13 of his 24 points in a decisive second quarter as the Bucks routed the Jazz 
at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The game was delayed 75 minutes when the Bucks' plane from Washington could not 
land in Milwaukee because of fog. The team landed in Grand Rapids, Mich., and 
took a 4-hour 45-minute bus ride to the Bradley Center. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 103, New Jersey 93 -- Moses Malone scored 12 of his 26 points in the 
fourth quarter, leading the Hawks to victory over the Nets at Atlanta. 
</P>

7:23 left. 
</P>

<P>
Phoenix 107, Miami 99 -- Tom Chambers scored 23 points, Eddie Johnson 20 and 
Armon Gilliam 19 as the Suns survived a late Miami rally for their 11th 
straight home victory at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, 14-2 at home, saw a 15-point fourth-quarter lead dwindle to 6 points 
as the Heat made an 11-0 run. But the Suns held on to move within a half-game 
of the Lakers for the Pacific Division lead. 
</P>
<P>

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
FLAME ROOKIE FLEURY CONTINUES HOT START WITH 2 GOALS IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Theoren Fleury, whose reckless style of play has won the hearts of 
Calgary fans, appears to be making the Flames a better team. 
</P>
<P>
Fleury, 20, who was called up from the minors earlier this week and was playing 
in only his second National Hockey League game, scored 2 goals Saturday night 
as the Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers, 7-2, at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it was a really big thrill for me," he said of his first NHL goal. "It's 
right up there with my experience in Moscow in the world junior championships 
(last season). Maybe I'm finally getting my chance." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gilmour also scored 2 goals for the Flames, who moved 10 points ahead of 
the second-place Kings and 12 ahead of the Oilers in the Smythe Division race. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said Saturday's performance by Fleury was a perfect 
example of why he has become a crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"The little water bug, he was just scooting out there, and the fans love that 
excitement," Crisp said. "He's colorful, talented and isn't afraid to hit. It's 
nice for everyone on our club when someone comes up to the NHL and does what 
he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Fleury had 3 assists in his NHL debut on Thursday in an 8-6 home victory over 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Flames opened a 7-0 lead before Craig Redmond ended goaltender 
Rick Wamsley's shutout bid at 15:39 of the third period. Former King Jimmy 
Carson scored the Oilers' other goal at 18:34. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Boston 1 -- Brian Skrudland scored a goal and set up another to 
help the Canadiens stretch their winning streak to 9 games with a victory over 
the Bruins at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chelios and Peter Svoboda also scored for the Canadiens, who are 5-0-1 
against the Bruins this season. Montreal, which is 21 points ahead of 
second-place Boston in the Adams Division, has outscored the Bruins, 18-7. 
</P>
<P>
Boston peppered goaltender Patrick Roy with 21 of its 27 shots during the final 
40 minutes but was unable to catch the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the game was played with only linesmen Ron Finn and Mike Cvik 
officiating. Referee Terry Gregson fractured his left collarbone and suffered a 
slight concussion after colliding with Montreal's Stephane Richer midway 
through the second period. He had to be taken off the ice on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 6, Chicago 3 -- Mike Ridley had a team-record 6 assists, including 
one on Kevin Hatcher's tiebreaking goal 4:01 into the third period, as the 
Capitals beat the Blackhawks at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Capitals a share of first place in the Patrick Division 
with the New York Rangers, 1 point ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The 
Capitals are 8-0-2 in their last 10 home games, and Chicago has lost 11 
straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Detroit 2 -- Sean Burke returned to the lineup and stopped 26 
shots and Aaron Broten set up a goal that sparked a 3-goal second period as the 
Devils beat the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, who had missed the past 4 games with a groin injury, was spectacular in 
the net, allowing only third-period goals by Steve Yzerman and Joey Kocur. By 
that time, New Jersey had opened a 5-0 lead en route to its second home victory 
in as many nights. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Tony Tanti scored 3 goals in a 6:46 span of the 
second period, and the Canucks tied a team record with 25 first-period shots as 
they beat the Penguins at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks, playing their third road game in four nights, ended a 0-2-1 slide 
and knocked the Penguins into second place in the Patrick Division, a point 
behind the New York Rangers and Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, New York Islanders 1 -- Recently acquired Carey Wilson 
continued his strong play with a second-period goal as the Rangers extended 
their unbeaten streak to 7 games with the victory at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has 11 points in 6 games since the Rangers acquired him in a Dec. 
26 trade with the Hartford Whalers, scored his fourth goal as a Ranger and 15th 
of the season. With Wilson in the lineup, the Rangers are 5-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Toronto 1 -- Rick Vaive scored 2 goals as the Sabres ended a 4-game 
losing streak by beating the Maple Leafs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Vaive, who started his NHL career with the Maple Leafs, has 5 goals in 6 games 
as a Sabre since being acquired from Chicago for Adam Creighton on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Ex-Flyer Peter Zezel scored twice, including the 
go-ahead goal late in the second period, as the Blues beat the Flyers at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Zezel, obtained by St. Louis from the Flyers on Nov. 29 for Mike Bullard, 
directed a centering pass from Bernie Federko past goalie Ron Hextall for his 
11th goal of the season at 14:40 of the second period, giving St. Louis a 5-4 
lead.

GOALKEEPER PEAT'S FIRST START A SUCCESS AS LAZERS POST 6-1 WIN OVER BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie goalkeeper Kris Peat won his first Major Indoor Soccer League start and 
Michael Collins and Fernando Clavijo each scored 2 goals as the Lazers beat the 
Baltimore Blast, 6-1, Saturday night before 6,823 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Peat, a first-round draft pick out of North Carolina State, shut out the Blast 
until Carl Valentine's goal with only 31 seconds left. Baltimore is the 
second-highest scoring team in the league. Peat made 17 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Collins extended his goal-scoring streak to 5 games when he scored at 10:06 
into the second period. He increased the lead to 2-0 at 2:36 of the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Waad Hirmez, who assisted on both of Collins' goals, added 1 of his own 4:45 
into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast pulled veteran goalie Slobo Ilijevski in favor of a sixth attacker, 
and Clavijo scored twice and Hector Marinaro added a goal for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine scored off the restart after Marinaro's goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight victory at home for the Lazers.

CONNECTICUT'S ROBINSON NOW WORKING HARD TO BECOME A TEAM LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He missed his first five field-goal attempts, but he didn't pout. He made a bad 
pass in the final minute, but instead of spacing out, he sprinted downcourt and 
swooped in behind Villanova's Gary Massey in a manner scarier than any Stephen 
King novel. Massey missed. 
</P>
<P>
In between, he gave up four inches and a gallon of sweat as he banged bodies 
with 7-foot-2 Tom Greis. And when the action stopped for a second, he bent like 
a willow and tugged at his shorts, the universal sign for basketball 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Lombardi once said that "fatigue makes cowards of us all." It did not 
make a coward of Cliff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of times I wanted to ask for a blow (breather)," Cliff 
Robinson said, "but it was too close, so I stayed in there." 
</P>
<P>
If the 1988-89 University of Connecticut basketball team were a building, Cliff 
Robinson would be the steel beams. Murray Williams may have supplied the final 
flash and dash and Tate George a gentle guiding hand in UConn's 57-55 win over 
Villanova Wednesday night in its Big East opener, but, as usual, it was 
Robinson who supplied the foundation and the unbending structural support that 
kept the Huskies from caving in. 
</P>
<P>
With scouts from seven National Basketball Association teams and a sellout 
Civic Center crowd of 16,016 in attendance, the 6-10 senior center struggled to 
score 20 points (on 10 of 29 field goal shooting) and grab nine rebounds. But 
while Robinson was taking good shots and clearly wasn't in command of the roll 
of the rim, he was in command of something far more important: 
</P>
<P>
Himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win so badly," Robinson said. "I don't want to go back to those 
first two years here. Before, I probably would have gotten myself out of the 
game because of fouls and frustration." 
</P>
<P>
When Cliff Robinson plays as he did Wednesday night, he makes "before" seem 
like a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Before" was when he whined to the referees. "Before" was when his body 
language bespoke anger and insolence that distracted him like a five-alarm fire 
whenever things weren't going his way. "Before" was when if Robinson got off to 
a slow start, he was better off on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But when this, a more intense, more mature Cliff Robinson is on the bench, the 
only people better off are the opposition. Ultimately, that made it a bad night 
for Villanova, because Robinson danced every dance, played every second of this 
frantic 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cliff was the most composed of any of our players," UConn Coach Jim Calhoun 
said. "He was the guy settling everyone down." 
</P>
<P>
He was also the guy expected to be The Man, as is the custom with prospective 
first round NBA draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
Especially Wednesday night. Greis notwithstanding, the Wildcats, along with 
Boston College, are the smallest team in the Big East. And inasmuch as the 
hulking Greis has a sweet shooting touch but little quickness or mobility, 
Calhoun was hoping Robinson would wheel around him like a racing car around a 
lap pole. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that Tom couldn't defend Cliff," Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun's feelings were based on obvious facts. But too often, the results were 
ruined by bad rim rolls. While Robinson got Greis in foul trouble -- limiting 
him to 28 minutes -- he wasn't getting the ball in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous (at the beginning)," Robinson said, "but I was overanxious. 
I've been having a tough year shooting." 
</P>
<P>
The same could hardly be said for Greis, who entered the game ranked sixth in 
field goal percentage in the Big East and was 5-of-5 from the field at 
halftime. Villanova had a two-point lead and Robinson, after an easy holiday 
diet of Harvard and Air Force, was having to work hard at both ends of the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Needlessly, as it turned out. Robinson finished with three steals and two 
blocked shots -- both blocks in the second half. Of Robinson's five rebounds in 
the second half -- four were on the offensive board. Hardly the signature of an 
exhausted man. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get Robinson down that the Huskies lost. None of it. He hung in there 
to get the Huskies their first win over Villanova since Jan. 23, 1982. He did 
what leaders do. He did what he knows he has to do for UConn to make nice 
noises in the beastly Big East. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't make much noise afterward. Just talked calmly about his 
responsibilities. Scolded himself for missing that last-minute free throw -- 
his only trip to the line all night -- that would have sealed Villanova's fate 
and made Murray Williams' mad dash unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
If he were a pro scout, Robinson was asked, how would he assessed Cliff 
Robinson's performance? 
</P>
<P>
"That he didn't shoot well but he kept playing hard," Robinson said. "He kept 
his intensity up and he boosted everybody to a win."

George Steinbrenner, sued Friday by Dave Winfield over claims that he owes more 
than $1 million to the David M. Winfield Foundation, said he has been making 
payments, but to an escrow account rather than directly to the outfielder's 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's suit claims the New York Yankees' principal owner, and Winfield's 
boss, failed to honor an agreement to pay $300,000 annually to the foundation 
that fights drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, who said the money was placed in an interest-bearing escrow 
account until "an investigation of the foundation is complete and all 
legitimate complaints against the foundation have been resolved," said that he 
discovered "numerous questionable practices" that will be outlined in a 
countersuit filed by him and the Yankees Monday.

NEWSWIRE: ITALY'S TRACK AND FIELD CHIEF QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Primo Nebiolo resigned Saturday as chairman of Italy's track federation after a 
series of scandals and subsequent criticism of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Federation spokesman Augusto Frasca said the resignation was expected and would 
take effect Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo, 64, is also president of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, track and field's world governing body. His resignation had no 
immediate effect on that position. 
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo has been hailed for his success in promoting the sport internationally. 
He was re-elected to a 4-year term as the Italian organization's chairman Dec. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
However, calls for his resignation came after it was revealed that the men's 
long jump result at the 1987 World Championships at Rome was fixed and grew 
louder during an investigation of alleged financial wrongdoings involving 
federation officials. 
</P>
<P>
An independent panel found that officials fixed the results so that an Italian, 
Giovanni Evangelisti, got the bronze medal instead of American Larry Myricks. 
Nebiolo was not named among the conspirators, but he was criticized for not 
taking quicker action on the matter. Evangelisti later surrendered his medal, 
and it was given to Myricks. 
</P>
<P>
The federation ruling council will reportedly meet on or before May 7 to choose 
a new chairman.

ROY MARBLE'S FREE THROW LIFTS IOWA PAST NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iowa used some aggressive rebounding and 23 points from Roy Marble to keep 
North Carolina off balance Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. But it took a little 
luck to put Marble on the free-throw line so the No. 9 Hawkeyes could beat the 
No. 6 Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's Jeff Lebo missed a short jumper with 22 seconds left that 
would have broken a 97-97 tie, and a foul was called in a scramble under the 
Iowa basket. Marble, despite North Carolina protests that he had not been 
fouled, made a free throw with 11 seconds left to give Iowa (13-1) a 98-97 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Ed Horton, who missed 2 key free throws earlier, was the Iowa 
player fouled, but Marble, who made his 8 previous free throws, got the nod 
from officials after pleading: "It was me. It was me." 
</P>
<P>
Marble missed the first free throw, but he hit the second. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith did not take a timeout to set up a play, and 
King Rice's long jumper was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (12-2) trailed by 8 points at halftime but took a 68-66 lead on 
a 3-point play by Rice with 13:41 left. It was the first of 14 lead changes in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 94, N.C. Charlotte 86 -- Andre Wiley came off the bench to score a 
career-high 29 points at Norman, Okla., including 8 in a late surge that helped 
hold off the 49ers, enabling the No. 4 Sooners to extend their winning streak 
to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King scored 25 points and Mookie Blaylock added 24 for Oklahoma (12-1). 
North Carolina-Charlotte (6-3) got 33 points from Byron Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma, averaging 113 points per game, went cold in the second half and went 
6:44 without a field goal. A free throw by Henry Williams, who scored 22 
points, capped a 19-4 run during the Sooner drought and made the score 78-75 
with 5:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley scored 10 straight Oklahoma points as the Sooners opened an 88-78 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 84, Virginia 76 -- Christian Laettner scored 13 of his 15 points in the 
second half to rally the top-ranked Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference game at Charlottesville, Va. It was Duke's 13th straight win over 
the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia (7-5 overall, 0-1 in the ACC), which has not beaten Duke (11-0, 2-0) 
since the first round of the 1983 ACC tournament, held a 38-35 halftime lead, 
led by Richard Morgan with 22 points.

Wolfpack a 60-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>

lead the Eagles at Pittsburgh. 
</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA, MICHIGAN RECOGNIZE THESE TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Merv Lopes and Ron Abegglen are not the biggest names among college basketball 
coaches, but they certainly have been part of the sport's biggest upsets during 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1983 when Lopes' Chaminade team toppled No. 1-ranked Virginia and Ralph 
Sampson. The victory became the standard against which future 
David-over-Goliath upsets were measured. 
</P>
<P>
They became part of the vernacular: In some circles, they were called 
"Chaminades." 
</P>
<P>
Abegglen's team from the University of Alaska-Anchorage pulled one off last 
week, when the Division II Seawolves beat No. 2-ranked Michigan at a tournament 
in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"In our eyes, it was a big upset," Abegglen said this week. "It was on a 
neutral court, with WAC officials. It was an awfully big win for us." 
</P>
<P>
It was in many eyes an even larger upset than Chaminade beating Virginia. 
Consider that Alaska-Anchorage played the last 3 1/2 minutes without its 
leading rebounder and second-leading scorer, Todd Fisher. And unlike the 
Virginia-Chaminade game, when the Cavaliers were coming back from Japan and 
Sampson was bothered by the flu, all of Michigan's front-line players were 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Playing against one of the best programs in the country was nothing new for the 
Seawolves. The school has been host to one of the country's best early-season 
tournaments, The Great Alaskan Shootout, for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"We get to mingle with the big guys every year," said Abegglen, 51. 
</P>
<P>
And beat them too. 
</P>
<P>
But while Abegglen still is enjoying the greatest night of his career, Lopes' 
12-year reign at Chaminade is about to come to an unceremonious end in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Lopes, who was passed over for several Division I jobs (most notably twice at 
Hawaii), resigned Dec. 22, effective at the end of the season. It came a few 
days before the start of the Chaminade Classic, the tournament in which the 
Silverswords upset the Cavaliers five years before. 
</P>
<P>
"We left the door open for Merv to return," Chaminade Athletic Director Mike 
Vasconcellos said from Honolulu. "The fire and determination and energy are 
still there, but it's probably the right time for Merv to get out of here for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade, coming off a 5-19 season, is 4-12 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State Coach Dale Brown, whose team won the tournament in Hawaii, said 
that Illinois is one of the best college teams he has seen in recent years. The 
Tigers, who beat Maryland Monday, lost to the Fighting Illini last month. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brown, what makes Illinois so difficult to defend is that it's 
hard to tell the players apart. "They all look alike, and play alike" said 
Brown. "You keep asking yourself which guy scored the basket because they're 
all so athletic." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Illinois' starters are all between 6-feet-4 and 6-7, between 180 and 
215 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
What's scary about this season's Illinois team is that sophomore Marcus 
Liberty, who sat out last season because of Proposition 48, doesn't start for 
the Fighting Illini. 
</P>
<P>
The joke around the Midwest is that Illinois Coach Lou Henson, whose postseason 
record has been awful, might not be able to keep this team out of the Final 
Four come late March. 
</P>
<P>
By the time most players reach their junior year, they would like to be in 
their team's starting lineup. Rhode Island junior Kenny Green isn't any 
different. But there is a difference: It's how Green has accepted his sixth-man 
role. 
</P>
<P>
After Green went through a tough stretch as a starter early last season, former 
Rams Coach Tom Penders (now at Texas) moved him to the bench. As the team's 
sixth man, he helped Rhode Island reach the Final 16 of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Al Skinner, who succeeded Penders, kept Green in that role this season for the 
Rams. He has appeared in 41 straight games as a reserve and is leading Rhode 
Island in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think he's unique," Skinner said. "He wants to start and play as much 
as he can, but I think what helps him accept his role so well is his maturity 
and the fact that he knows we're going to utilize him to the best of his 
abilities." 
</P>
<P>
How much do the Oklahoma Sooners miss their senior center, All-American Stacey 
King? Not much, if you judge solely by the box scores. In the four games that 
King has missed, the high-scoring Sooners have averaged nearly 115 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma has scored more than 100 in nine straight games, three shy of 
Nevada-Las Vegas' NCAA record. The Sooners should be able to break the mark, 
with games against North Carolina-Charlotte on national television Saturday, 
Nebraska, Pitt and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mississippi Coach Ed Murphy has the right idea. Instead of putting his 
leading scorer on the cover of this season's press guide, Murphy featured the 
players who performed well in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he had four players with a 3.0 or better grade-point average. At 
some places, it would be a blank. Funny that Dean Smith, who has gone as far as 
featuring assistant coaches on the cover of the North Carolina guide, didn't 
think of it first. 
</P>
<P>
Former Marquette Coach Rick Majerus has Ball State off to an 11-0 start in his 
second season at the Muncie, Ind., school. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals -- who have beaten Minnesota, Purdue and Northwestern -- are more 
famous for all the mentions they get from the school's most publicized alum, 
late-night talk show host David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
In the six years since the Big East went to nine schools, the postseason 
tournament game between the bottom two teams almost has been the private domain 
of Providence and Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars have played in the game -- the winner gets to meet the first-place 
team when the tournament officially begins -- four times. The Pirates also have 
been in it four times. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't appear that they will meet this year, unless it's for the 
championship. Both teams are undefeated. Providence is 11-0 going into 
Connecticut Saturday, and 10th-ranked Seton Hall is 13-0 going into its game at 
Syracuse Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Four of this year's mainstays for first-year Providence Coach Rick Barnes had 
personality clashes with former Coach Gordon Chiesa. Marty Conlon quit the team 
after 11 games. Carlton Screen was benched. Both had played prominent roles 
when the Friars went to the Final Four under Rick Pitino two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes is being compared a great deal to Pitino, now with the New York Knicks. 
According to Big East followers, about the only things they have in common are 
their first names and their successful records. In two years as a head coach, 
including one at George Mason, Barnes is 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick (Barnes) doesn't take himself so seriously, like Pitino did," said one 
Providence watcher. 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said about Barnes' Friars.

Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, skiing through a driving rain, picked up her 
eighth straight World Cup victory and fourth giant slalom win of the season 
Saturday at Schwarzenberg, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter whether it rains, snows or whether the sun shines. It's 
simply running," Schneider said of her record winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
She had the best time in both heats for a winning total of 2 minutes 16.75 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider on Friday broke the record of 6 consecutive victories in Alpine 
skiing, held by Swedish veteran Ingemar Stenmark and Italian Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
With her victory Saturday, Schneider widened her lead in the World Cup 
standings. She has 207 points, while Ulrike Maier of Austria is second with 118 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Maier was second, 49/100ths of a second behind, with Carole Merle of France 
third after posting the second-best time in the second heat and 2:17.50 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Maier has 5 seconds and 4 third places this season.

Holding a 65-7 halftime lead, the Cleveland High basketball team naturally 
suffered a mental letdown entering the third quarter of the Northwest Valley 
Conference opener at Canoga Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Braswell, however, did not let his players' intensity lag for long, 
according to forward Lucious Harris, who scored a game-high 40 points in the 
Cavaliers' 126-29 rout. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of started to get relaxed after the first half," Harris said. "But 
Coach told us, 'Don't take nothing for granted.' So we kept our intensity up 
and kept playing our game." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Cleveland's game included a tenacious full-court press, which the 
Cavaliers employed from the opening tip-off until the middle of the third 
quarter. Cleveland (11-2) outscored Canoga Park, 40-6, in the third period to 
take a 105-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cleveland led by 100 points late in the fourth quarter, Harris felt 
little sympathy for Canoga Park (2-9). 
</P>
<P>
"We just went out there to play," he said. "I played hard the entire game and 
everyone else on the team played extremely well. I had to play my game. I can't 
change that for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Add rout: Taft Coach Jim Woodard guaranteed that the same scenario would not 
occur when the Toreadors (11-1) play host to Canoga Park on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't press when we're ahead by a lot of points," Woodard said. "I would 
not feel comfortable doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Add Cleveland: Woodard said that this season's Cavalier squad might be the best 
that the Reseda school has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got great depth," Woodard said. "They've always been extremely quick 
and had great guards. But in the past they've been hurt inside by teams with 
good inside people, like Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
"But this year, they've got some very good inside players who can hold their 
own against other good big men." 
</P>
<P>
Turnaround: After losing its first 6 games, Reseda has won 2 in a row and 3 of 
its past 4, including a 71-59 victory over Poly in a Valley Pac-8 Conference 
opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Halpern, who is in his first season with Reseda after having coached at 
Birmingham and Van Nuys, said that the Regents' swing in fortune is the result 
of his players gaining confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to learn how to win and how to play the game when we're ahead," 
Halpern said. "Those may sound like some pretty basic things, but they are 
things that a lot of these kids weren't used to dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda was 1-11 and 2-10 the previous 2 seasons in Valley 4-A League play, and 
the constant failure took a toll on the team's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
"They were used to losing and I wasn't," said Halpern, who coached Van Nuys to 
a 21-3 record in 1985 and Birmingham to a 22-3 mark in '87. "Getting the kids 
to believe in themselves was one of the first things I started working on." 
</P>
<P>
Life after Handschu?: Montclair Prep's Craig Handschu underwent knee surgery 
last week and the senior guard is expected to miss the rest of the season. 
Mountie co-Coach Bob Webb is wondering how he will replace Handschu's 28 points 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like starting over again," Webb said. "Everybody's going to have to try 
harder to make up for the lost scoring and to try to keep the other team's 
scoring down." 
</P>
<P>
Without Handschu, Montclair Prep (10-5) was walloped by Alpha League rival L. 
A. Baptist, 66-47, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Handschu, the state's highest scoring returning guard, injured his left knee 2 
weeks ago and underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon and cartilage and 
remove a bone chip. He'll wear a leg brace for 3 to 6 weeks, but a return to 
the team this season is unlikely.

GLENDALE HOLDS OFF CANYONS; 
</P>
<P>
MISSED LAYIN COSTLY FOR COUGARS, 70-68 
</P>

<P>
College of the Canyons priced itself right out of a chance at victory Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars trailed visiting Glendale, 70-68, with 14 seconds remaining in the 
Western State Conference game, and Canyons Coach Lee Smelser called a timeout 
to set up a play. 
</P>
<P>
When play resumed, the Cougars cleared the side for guard Kevin Price, who 
drove past Vigen Serop to the basket but missed an uncontested layup that 
likely would have sent the game into overtime. Justin Lord rebounded for 
Glendale, and the Vaqueros escaped with their first WSC win in 2 tries. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we would let Price use his quickness," Smelser said. "You've got to 
convert those when you get the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (10-7, 1-1) could have sealed the victory earlier had it converted 
some pressure free throws. The Vaqueros missed the front end of 4 1-and-1 
situations in the final minute -- 3 by Lord and 1 by Alex Berry. 
</P>
<P>
"That could have been a 10-point win, but we've got to make it so I lose four 
years off my life," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "You've just got to 
be confident, but you could tell Justin had negative vibes up there." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (10-9, 1-1) fell behind, 15-4, in the early going and trailed, 38-30, 
at halftime. But the Cougars passed the Vaqueros in the second half behind the 
play of center Deon Myricks (12 points and 15 rebounds), forward Aaron Clark 
(17 points, 9 rebounds) and guard Larry Allbritton (12 points, all in the 
second half). 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied 6 times in the final 8 minutes before Glendale surged to a 
70-66 lead on Berry's 3-point play with 1:12 remaining. A pair of free throws 
by Allbritton made it 70-68 and set the stage for Price's missed layup. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons had one last chance after Lord missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 4 
seconds left. But the Cougars, out of timeouts, had to inbound the ball in the 
backcourt, and Clark's desperation shot from halfcourt bounced off the 
backboard. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Fowler led Glendale with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Bruce Heicke added 13 
points, and Lord and Jimmie Fowler each had 11.

OCCIDENTAL FALLS VICTIM TO OLD WAYS OF EX-COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the major adjustments Brian Newhall made when he took over for Bill 
Westphal as basketball coach at Occidental College was to all but abolish the 
3-point shot upon which the Tigers relied so heavily last season. 
</P>
<P>
Westphal left to take the coaching job at Grand Canyon College in Arizona, and, 
as evidenced by his team's 88-80 win over the Tigers in the championship game 
of the Occidental tournament Saturday night, he maintains his affection for the 
perimeter shot. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope guard Darryl Williford, who scored a game-high 27 points, accounted 
for 7 of Grand Canyon's 11 baskets from 3-point range. Although Williford was 
consistently deadly from long range -- often releasing missiles from 5 to 8 
feet beyond the 3-point stripe -- Occidental fans persisted in chanting 
"Shoot!" when he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted those guys to shut up," Newhall said of the taunters. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental trailed by 20, 74-54, with 7 minutes to play when it mounted an 
impressive rally led by senior forward John Keister. 
</P>
<P>
Keister scored 9 points and Jon Crawley and Ethan Caldwell also scored as 
Occidental ran off a 14-2 spurt in a span of 3 minutes to trim the deficit to 
76-68. 
</P>
<P>
But with 4:13 to play, Chris Anderson, the Tigers' 6-foot 10-inch center who 
scored a team-high 22 points, fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum did not immediately swing in the Antelopes' favor, however, as 
Caldwell converted a 3-point shot and Crawley added a turnaround jump shot from 
the free-throw line. Caldwell then buried a 12-foot baseline jump shot with 
2:25 to play to cut the deficit to 81-75. But the flurry came too late as the 
Tigers were unable to catch Grand Canyon down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnson scored 15 points and Mike Ledbetter added 10 for Grand Canyon, 
which led at halftime, 45-35. The Antelopes led by as many as 15 points in the 
first half before Occidental mounted a short rally midway through the half. 
Williford made 5 3-point baskets in the first half.

ART NOTEBOOK: L.A.'S 'ART AGAINST AIDS' -- A CREATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO FINANCING 
THE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles art world is mobilizing for "Art Against AIDS," a fund-raising 
campaign to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles and the American Foundation for 
AIDS Research. More than 200 artists have contributed paintings, drawings, 
photographs and sculptures to the campaign, which will be capped with a VIP 
dinner at the home of campaign co-chairs Ted and Susie Field. 
</P>
<P>
Plans -- including entertainment and guests' names -- are still in formation 
for the Jan. 29 celebration. Tickets are $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
An inaugural exhibition/reception at the Murray Feldman Gallery on Dec. 14 
raised $700,000 and drew top names from West and East Coast society, as well as 
dozens of artists, buyers and browsers. 
</P>
<P>
Works have been donated by artist committee co-chairs David Hockney and Sam 
Francis, as well as Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Jonathan Borofsky and Dennis 
Hopper. In addition, the campaign and benefit committees include many of the 
city's notable philanthropists and arts patrons, including Jane and Michael 
Eisner, Edythe and Eli Broad, David Geffen, Ariadne Getty, Veronique and 
Gregory Peck, Richard Koshalek and Rusty Powell. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hockney: "It is particularly poignant that the creative community so 
ravaged by AIDS has rallied together to fight the disease." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is free and open to the public through Jan. 29 before moving to 
San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. For information 
about "Art Against AIDS" or the Jan. 29 dinner, call (213) 552-6922. 
</P>
<P>
"Art Against AIDS," The Murray Feldman Gallery, 8687 Melrose Ave. (in the 
Pacific Design Center), West Hollywood. Open Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
BRAUER'S HOUR: More than 30 watercolors and gouaches by Arki Brauer will be on 
display at Jack Rutberg Fine Arts beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most renowned of modern-day Viennese artists, Brauer was a co-founder 
of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. His works, characterized by 
visionary Utopias populated by amorphous creatures, have led to exhibits in 
many of the modern art museums of Europe. Brauer is designing the Brauer House, 
an architectural commission from the city of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit concludes Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, 357 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 938-5222. Open 
Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE VISIONS: The real world rendered surreal is the link between painters 
Malinda Beeman and Christopher Warner, whose works will be on display at the 
Koplin Gallery until Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Beeman's work, reminiscent of Henri Rousseau, manipulates natural landscapes 
with vibrant color and varying perspective. Warner uses composites of differing 
natural scenes, from the Los Angeles River to the mountains of his native 
Montana, to produce paintings that contrast the traditional American West with 
man's alteration of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Beeman is an instructor at the University of Houston; Warner was recently 
featured in a group exhibition at the Otis Art Institute. This is the first Los 
Angeles solo show for both artists. 
</P>
<P>
Koplin Gallery, 8225 1/2 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 656-3378. Open 
Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

HIROHITO'S DEATH STIRS MEMORIES OF OLD JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a child growing up in Japan, Kaoruko Yamanouchi remembers dressing in her 
best clothes every summer to welcome young Emperor Hirohito as he stopped in 
her hometown of Utsunomiya, about an hour north of Tokyo, while traveling to 
his summer residence. 
</P>
<P>
Yamanouchi has lived in the United States for 30 years, but on Saturday she was 
wearing a black armband as she went about her errands in Los Angeles' Little 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
To her, the late Emperor Hirohito, who died Friday at the age of 87, was a 
"scholar (who) loved our country," and only a recent knee operation will keep 
her from returning to her homeland for his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my doctor yesterday if I could go," said Yamanouchi, a retired social 
worker. "He said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Japanese immigrants living in Little Tokyo, particularly the elderly, the 
emperor's death is a somber occasion, but it has far less meaning for 
Japanese-Americans born in the United States, no matter what their age. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm American-born, so for me it's like something happening to the King or 
Queen of England," said Ruth Miyauchi, a resident of Little Tokyo Towers, an 
apartment building for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure my parents are grieving about it, or my grandparents," said Judy 
Miyakawa, a Cal Poly freshman, as she arrived for work at the Japan-America 
Theater box office. "He's more of a symbol of old Japan. But Japan is so 
capitalistic now. I don't know why everybody's making such a big fuss about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimiko Roberts, a seventh-grader and fourth-generation Japanese-American, has 
never been to Japan. But she learned about the emperor recently when she wrote 
a report about him for school. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, I guess I'm more of a true American, so I don't really feel that much," 
said Kimiko, who was wearing a black-and-white sweat shirt with matching hoop 
earrings. "But I know it is really hard on the people who live in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Signs of Mourning 
</P>
<P>
Despite the emperor's death and the unusually chilly weather, the shopping 
plazas in Little Tokyo were bustling Saturday. Japanese-language newspaper 
clippings reporting Hirohito's death were displayed in the windows of the 
Kouraku restaurant and the Modern Food Market; otherwise, there were few 
visible signs of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials at the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles were planning to 
accept condolences next week from business and political leaders and members of 
the 190,000-member Japanese-American community in the county. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said condolence calls can be made Monday and Tuesday between 10 
a.m. and 5 p.m. at the consulate, Suite 1200 in the Sumitomo Bank Building, 250 
E. 1st St. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of other large organizations had no immediate plans to mark the 
emperor's death. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center planned to go ahead with a 
New Year's event scheduled for today at 11:30 a.m., according to Katsumi 
Kunitsugu, executive secretary. She said a statement about the emperor will be 
read as part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kyosan Buddhist Temple where a memorial service is tentatively planned 
for Jan. 15, Seicho Asahi, one of the ministers who came to this country seven 
years ago, said that for him, the loss is personal. "He was part of the 
family," Asahi said. 
</P>
<P>
And at Yagura Ichiban restaurant, the Japanese-born manager, Takee Sato, said 
he would light incense at Nishi Hongwanshi Temple to commemorate the emperor's 
death. "He was like a god," said Sato in halting English. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the differences in reaction to the emperor's passing between 
immigrant and the American-born were two personal recollections with 
contrasting overtones. 
</P>
<P>
A white-haired American-born woman in charge of the visitors' register at the 
Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center had a personal memory of 
Emperor Hirohito that was more amusing than sad. 
</P>
<P>
When she was 11, the woman spent a year at a Japanese grammar school. One day, 
the emperor paid a visit. 
</P>
<P>
To show their respect, the schoolchildren were told to kneel and keep their 
heads bowed. As an American unused to such gestures, she remained on her feet 
to the 
</P>
<P>
mortification of her mother, who also happened to be visiting. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hirohito) didn't smile. He looked straight ahead," said the woman, who was 
too embarrassed to see her name published. "He had a beautiful face, like a 
movie star." 
</P>
<P>
But for Hiroshi Nanadzue, 86, a native of Japan, Hirohito's death has unlocked 
deep-seated memories from his childhood. As a boy, Nanadzue lived near the 
Imperial Palace in Tokyo and every morning he used to tip his cap to the young 
prince as the future emperor and his two brothers rode to school in a 
horse-drawn buggy. Every morning, Hirohito would nod back. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'The emperor. The emperor.' To me, he was just another kid," 
Nanadzue said, brushing tears from his eyes.

NEW IRWINDALE SITE FOR RAIDERS PARK SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of shifting the site of the proposed Los Angeles Raiders 
stadium in Irwindale has been raised by Irwindale Mayor Pat Miranda, who 
expressed concern about resistance by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Los 
Angeles County officials to providing parking land for the preferred stadium 
site. 
</P>
<P>
After learning of adverse environmental comments by federal officials to 
proposals to use a 170-acre parcel in the Santa Fe Dam basin for stadium 
parking, Miranda told a City Council study session last week that he felt it 
might be advisable to choose another location for the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The alternate site would be on private land in Irwindale, not subject to 
federal or county control, west of the San Gabriel River Freeway and south of 
the Foothill Freeway. Other private land nearby could be used for the parking. 
The preferred site up to now is about a mile away, north of the Foothill 
Freeway just west of the Irwindale Avenue exit. 
</P>
<P>
The alternate site is listed as a possible choice in a stadium environmental 
impact report that has been under preparation for more than a year and is 
expected to be approved Thursday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But Miranda's comments about actually using it drew a suggestion from City 
Manager Charles Martin that it is probably premature to discuss it. And John 
Herrera, a senior Raiders official who was at the meeting, said he knew little 
about the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the stadium site are but one of many uncertainties that have 
arisen in the last few months about the Raiders' Irwindale deal. Irwindale has 
been under a September, 1987, Superior Court order blocking it from going ahead 
with a final stadium agreement with the Raiders and arranging financing for the 
stadium until the environmental report is approved by the court as well as the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, questions have arisen whether adequate financing can be 
obtained for a project with a cost estimated at $150 million, and two of the 
three men who negotiated a preliminary agreement with the Raiders -- Xavier 
Hermosillo and Fred Lyte -- have been discharged from the matter by city 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harm to Wildlife Cited 
</P>
<P>
And in a Dec. 13 letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency opposed any lease of the 170 acres of federal property to 
Irwindale or the Raiders for parking at the preferred stadium site. 
</P>
<P>
At present, this vacant land is leased by Los Angeles County, and both county 
and Corps of Engineers approval would be needed for it to be used. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency letter called the land in question a 
"premiere remnant example of alluvial sage scrub habitat" and "an integral part 
of a wildlife corridor that stretches from the (Santa Fe Dam) basin to the San 
Gabriel Mountains." It suggested there would be irreversible harm to the 
wildlife if it were paved for parking. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the county and the corps are trying to hold this project back," 
Miranda said at the Council study session. He said the alternate site might be 
better because it "would not involve them at all." 
</P>
<P>
But W. J. Lockman, whose firm is in charge of preparing the environmental 
impact report, told council members that frequent contacts he has had with the 
Corps of Engineers and county authorities led him to believe that eventually 
they will support the leasing of the parking land. "Of course, it will take a 
lot of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Way to Speed Up Corps 
</P>
<P>
The corps usually moves slowly in such matters, and Irwindale officials said 
they have received suggestions that the only way to effectively move the agency 
along is to find a willing congressman who has clout with it. 
</P>
<P>
But there are troubles at the county level too, with some county supervisors 
reluctant to support any step that would facilitate the Raiders' plans to quit 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred stadium site is on private land, but unless proposed parking land 
controlled by the government agencies is made available, stadium-goers would 
have to be shuttled by bus from as far as a mile away.

2 SISTERS DIE IN EARLY MORNING HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors broke windows and hacked at the door with pickaxes, but the fire that 
swept through several houses in East Los Angeles raged too ferociously for 
anyone to rescue two teen-age sisters who died in their bedroom early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By the time firefighters extinguished the predawn blaze, Angelica and Laura 
Ornelas were dead. And 18 neighbors and relatives who lived in a jumble of 
houses on the same small lot were homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Cruz, who lived in a connected house that was heavily damaged, said he 
heard coughing and wheezing -- muffled screams, perhaps, he was not sure -- 
coming from the 7-foot-by-8-foot bedroom as he tried to save the sisters. But 
thick smoke and flames repulsed every attempt at rescue, including those of 
sheriff's deputies who arrived a short while later. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said fire officials removed a portable heater from the house; others 
said they heard investigators mention electrical wiring as a possible cause of 
the fire. The County Fire Department would only say that all possibilities, 
including arson, are being investigated. Authorities estimated the damage at 
about $133,000. 
</P>
<P>
The scene Saturday afternoon drew blank stares and tears from family and 
friends who gathered at the narrow lot in the 3300 block of Winter Avenue in 
the City Terrace section of East Los Angeles to mourn the death of the sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were close in age and they did everything together," said Elizabeth 
Rodriguez, a family friend. "It's just a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
It might have been worse, relatives said, if two other sisters who usually 
share the bedroom had not been visiting their family in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:49 a.m., sheriff's deputies responded to a call on the 911 emergency line. 
When they arrived, flames were leaping over telephone wires and lapping at 
nearby structures. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Lee Taylor said that deputies misunderstood the Spanish-speaking 
relatives who had managed to escape unharmed and went into the wrong house in 
search of the two sisters. But by then it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
After six engine companies put out the fire, the sisters were found, one on a 
bed, the other on the floor. Taylor said they apparently died of smoke 
inhalation. Angelica Ornelas, 19, was described as friendly and happy. She was 
studying computer training. Laura Ornelas, 17, was a student a Garfield High 
School and was said to have been shy, the more retiring of the two. 
</P>
<P>
Almost untouched by the blaze, neat piles of fresh lumber sat in the front yard 
Saturday afternoon, as children poked around in the ashes. Neighbors said the 
wood was going to be used to build an addition to one of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the fire, Rogelina Verduzco had made plans with the two 
sisters to go out the next day to spread their Jehovah's Witness faith. 
Verduzco said the sisters had wanted to go door-to-door early in the morning, 
but the cold weather dissuaded them. They agreed to go later. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before noon, when Verduzco arrived to pick them up, the house was a 
mass of cinders and blackened debris. Charred Bible tracts littered the room 
where the sisters died. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe it," Verduzco said, weeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Displaced 
</P>
<P>
In another early morning blaze, six people were injured, four families 
displaced and more than $300,000 damage caused to a Victorian-style duplex 
southwest of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the 1400 block of South Magnolia Avenue was attributed to faulty 
wiring in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter fell from a ladder and was burned; three others also suffered 
injuries, all of which were minor. Two civilians were treated for smoke 
inhalation.

Antonia Martin can breathe a bit easier nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced Friday that affordable housing has been located for the 
59-year-old Torrance woman and that the impending court battle between her and 
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Although the archdiocese is still asking the disabled widow to leave the small 
wood-frame house she has lived in for 20 years, at least Martin now has a place 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
Next month she will move into a senior citizens apartment complex in Redondo 
Beach and leave the 600-square-foot house on the grounds of St. James Catholic 
School in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
There her husband, Angel, worked as a custodian from 1968 until his death in 
July, 1987. While he worked at the school, the church allowed the couple and 
their two daughters to live rent-free in the previously abandoned house. 
</P>
<P>
But after Angel died, the church asked his widow to move out. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who lives alone on $340-a-month disability checks, argued that she 
couldn't afford to move. And besides, she said, church officials told her in 
November that she could stay 
</P>
<P>
until she could afford to move. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had asked the church to let her stay until June, when she turns 60 and 
becomes eligible for the Social Security benefits that would enable her to 
afford an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese said it couldn't wait and decided to ask a South Bay Municipal 
Court judge to evict Martin. The case was scheduled for Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Martin has agreed to move out by 
</P>
<P>
February, church officials said they are willing to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
"The case has been settled and everyone is happy," said Mark Todd, a paralegal 
working for the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Martin agreed. "Estoy contenta," she said in an interview Saturday. "I'm 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who came to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967, will be living at Casa De 
Los Amigos, a federally funded senior citizens apartment project that charges 
rent according to the tenant's income. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's attorney, Margaret Kirby, was told about the inexpensive housing 
opportunity by a parishioner at St. James Catholic Church who had heard about 
Martin's situation. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment complex usually has a lengthy waiting list, church officials 
siad, but because of Martin's situation, she was given priority. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's attorney, Margaret Kirby, said she is glad the case was settled 
without a legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy and excited," she said. HUGO MARTIN

ZONING STUDY FOR SCHOOL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to avoid controversy, the Torrance City Council told the city 
staff last week to study how the former Columbia School site and surplus land 
at the Southern California Regional Occupational Center should be zoned before 
the properties are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-acre elementary school site on 186th Street, which is zoned for public 
use, became vacant in June. The 2 acres of surplus property at the vocational 
school on Crenshaw Boulevard is zoned for manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbia site is bounded by a residential neighborhood on the north and 
west and by businesses on the south and east. The vocational school land is 
bounded by Charles Wilson Park on the north, Torrance High School on the south 
and east and Crenshaw on the west. 
</P>
<P>
The council recommended the study to avoid a situation they faced with the 
former Meadow Park School site on 230th Street west of Hawthorne Boulevard. A 
developer purchased the land before the zoning was changed from its former 
"public use" zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Since the land did not have new zoning restrictions, the developer tried to get 
the city's approval for a high-density residential project. Neighbors objected 
and negotiations dragged on for nearly two years before a lower-density project 
was approved. 
</P>
<P>
A staff report is expected at Tuesday's council meeting.

237 DRIVERS ARRESTED OVER HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 237 people were arrested on charges of driving under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs during the Christmas and New Year's holidays by special 
units fielded by South Bay police agencies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 131 motorists received citations for offenses such as speeding 
and illegal lane changes. 
</P>
<P>
The infractions were recorded between Dec. 19 and Jan. 1 by law-enforcement 
teams that set up checkpoints and operated roving patrols. 
</P>
<P>
One team included officers from the South Los Angeles California Highway 
Patrol, Lennox sheriff's station and police departments in El Segundo, Gardena, 
Hawthorne, Inglewood, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. Units 
from the Lomita sheriff's station were hired by Palos Verdes Peninsula cities 
to patrol Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates and Rolling Hills on

ARAB MAYOR CALM IN FACE OF THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BETHLEHEM, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Elias Freij pulled an opulent woolen kaftan over his street clothes and 
assured a visitor that his only worry for the moment was his heater. It had 
broken down, and the wind that whips across Bethlehem this time of year had 
chilled his house enough to make him shiver. 
</P>
<P>
One might have suspected that Freij, who styles himself "the world's best-known 
mayor," might have other preoccupations. The Christian Arab mayor's call for a 
truce between rebellious Palestinians and the occupying Israeli army had 
brought criticism and danger almost to his door. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti on walls just a few blocks from his home scolded "Shame on Freij" and 
threatened "Death to Traitors." Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, in an apparent reference to Freij, said last week that 
any Palestinian who calls for an end to the Arab uprising against Israel 
"exposes himself to the bullets of his own people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Bodyguards 
</P>
<P>
Freij dismissed the threats with what might be called enthusiastic calm. "You 
don't see any bodyguards here, do you? You were able to come right in. My house 
is open, as you see," he told the visitor Friday. "I'm not in hiding. I'm at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there was less security than is usual for the elderly mayor; no one 
bothered to stop intruders at the gate who, contrary to custom, were able to 
enter without identifying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But for all his devil-may-care tranquillity, Freij was careful to point out 
that, in the wake of Arafat's words and the threatening scrawls, he had 
withdrawn his proposal for a truce between Israel and Palestinians, one that 
would have effectively ended the uprising while some form of negotiation takes 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my views clear. I stand by every word I say. But if the PLO says it is 
not time for a truce, then I withdraw my suggestion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A cautionary tale lies in Freij's proposal, the resulting threats and his rapid 
pullback. For all the talk of moderation within the PLO, old habits die hard. 
And because diplomatic advances by the PLO, especially with the United States, 
depend on the organization's renunciation of terror, the PLO's words and 
actions are under unusual scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Reaction by Shultz 
</P>
<P>
Following Arafat's indirect threat, Secretary of State George P. Shultz 
responded sharply. In comments to reporters, Shultz reminded Arafat that 
renunciation of terrorism could not be selective if Washington was expected to 
maintain contact with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"The statement that (Arafat) made, and we were very clear about it, was not a 
statement 'I renounce all terrorism except in Israel or the West Bank.' It was 
a renunciation of terrorism -- period," Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials saw Arafat's comment as proof that the PLO's new, moderate 
image is superficial and reminded everyone that Palestinians who in any way 
cross the PLO are subject to assassination. 
</P>
<P>
While Arafat quickly lashed out at the call for a truce, he has yet to respond 
to Arab groups that press for greater violence in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip with the aim of expelling Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the PLO declared the existence of a vaguely defined, independent 
Palestinian state prepared to coexist with Israel, at least three groups in the 
West Bank and Gaza have publicly opposed such a notion: Hamas, an Islamic 
fundamentalist movement based in Gaza but with growing support on the West 
Bank; the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a faction of the PLO 
that opposed Arafat's proclaimed moderation but that stayed within the 
organization, and a new, amorphous alliance of pro-Syrian, anti-Arafat groups. 
</P>
<P>
All such groups want a state of Palestine to encompass all territory between 
the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. So far, these foes of Arafat have 
expressed themselves only through leaflets and the occasional call for wildcat 
commercial strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Danger cannot be discounted. On Saturday, a local leader in the West Bank 
village of Qubeiba, near Ramallah, was stabbed to death by a mob of Muslim 
fundamentalists, Palestinian sources said. The killers accused the leader, 
Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah, of collaborating with Israeli authorities and 
advising villagers to carry on normal business on protest strike days. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen suspected collaborators have been killed by Palestinians 
during the 13-month-old uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Freij off-handedly plays down the threat to himself. "So what?" he advised. 
"There are extremists in any situation." 
</P>
<P>
With a diplomacy honed during 17 years of survival as a Palestinian politician, 
Freij added: "The PLO is our leadership. Anyone else must support the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
But why should the PLO be the only representative for the Palestinians? "The 
PLO is recognized by foreign governments and the Arab world as our leader. They 
have freedom of action. Where we live, we are exposed to arrest and expulsion. 
Only the PLO can act freely on our behalf," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He arose to prepare himself for one of his customary duties -- the reception of 
Christian patriarchs celebrating the Epiphany, Jesus's revelation to the 
nations of the world through the Three Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it is hard to be in the spotlight. You have to watch every step, 
every word, jealously," he said.

U.S. PRODS RELUCTANT GREECE TO EXTRADITE ARAB TERROR SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ATHENS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his prison cell, Palestinian Mohammed Rashid is emerging as a key 
international symbol of American resolve -- and Greek ambivalence -- in the 
fight against terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid, a tall and spare 39-year-old, says he is a freedom fighter, but the 
United States says he is an airplane bomber. It wants to make him the first 
alleged international terrorist successfully extradited to face American 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek Supreme Court is deciding whether to ratify a lower court decision 
granting the U.S. extradition request. Diplomatic sources and Athens newspapers 
speculate that the decision will come later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Accused by the United States of planting the in-flight bomb that killed a 
Japanese teen-ager and wounded 15 other passengers on a Pan Am 747 flying from 
Tokyo to Honolulu in 1982, Rashid was arrested last May when he sought to enter 
Greece on a forged Syrian passport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Tip Cited 
</P>
<P>
An intelligence tip from the United States led to his arrest, but resolution of 
his case implies a collision of opposites: the Reagan Administration pursuing 
terrorists wherever it can find them versus the government of Socialist Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou seeking conciliation with Greece's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Greece's Western allies say Papandreou is soft on 
terrorism, preferring to see no evil than to vigorously pursue terrorist groups 
that have used Greece as a base. 
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government's anti-terrorism policy appears to be one of complete 
surrender. The security of every citizen in the world is jeopardized by its 
unconscionable conduct," charged nine U.S. congressmen in a resolution 
submitted to the House last week that calls for Rashid's prompt extradition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Accusations 
</P>
<P>
The Papandreou government denies accusations that it has a gentlemen's 
agreement allowing safe harbor in Greece for Palestinian extremists in exchange 
for their promise not to commit acts of violence in Greece or against Greek 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
At a court hearing in July, Rashid denied any role in the 1982 bombing. "The 
Americans say what they like," he asserted. "I had nothing to do with it." He 
said he is a member of the Palestine Liberation Army, a wing of Yasser Arafat's 
Palestine Liberation Organization. "I was passing through Greece on a secret 
mission," he told the court. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators believe Rashid, who was jailed in Greece from 1973 to 1976 
for possession of hashish, is a senior member of an extremist Palestinian 
terrorist group called May 15. The group has been named as one of the suspects 
in last month's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Greece is at pains to maintain good ties with Arab neighbors to whom it is 
linked by history and geography as well as by ideology and economics. Arab 
states are among Greece's strongest supporters in its simmering dispute with 
Turkey over Cyprus. The government said last week that it could not intervene 
in the Rashid affair since it was before the courts, but domestic opponents say 
that under Papandreou, the line between politics and the law has not always 
been clear. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise decision in mid-December that most observers ascribe to 
Papandreou personally, Greece reneged on an agreement to extradite Palestinian 
terrorist suspect Abdel Osama Zomar to Italy, deporting him instead to a 
welcoming Libya. 
</P>
<P>
Italian police say Zomar, now 27, helped to plan an attack on Rome's main 
synagogue, in which a 2-year-old boy died and about three dozen worshipers were 
wounded in October, 1982. The next month, Zomar, who is linked to 
Libya-supported Palestinian extremist Abu Nidal, was caught driving a car 
loaded with explosives near the Greek border with Turkey. In 1984, the Supreme 
Court approved Zomar's extradition to Italy at the end of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
When the time for extradition arrived last month, Justice Minister Vassilis 
Rotis, a newcomer to the Greek government with no great personal clout, 
concluded that in bombing the synagogue, Zomar had been "acting in the struggle 
for the re-acquisition of his homeland." He was ordered deported to the country 
of his choice. He chose Libya.

BUT WAR MEMORIES SPARK SOME CRITICISM OF HIROHITO; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD SENDS CONDOLENCES TO JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some declared states of 
mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday, but painful memories of World 
War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said in a message of condolence to the Japanese people that 
Hirohito's 62-year reign "spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet at the 
same time constructive eras, in the history of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty played a truly 
heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end," Reagan 
said, referring to Hirohito's decision to end World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent his "sincere condolences" and 
"profound sympathy" to the Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities with what 
still is known officially as "militarist Japan." The Kremlin currently is 
striving for better ties and increased trade with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
India declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor of Hirohito, and 
Norway's King Olav V announced a three-week court mourning. President Francois 
Mitterrand of France opened an international conference on chemical weapons 
with a minute of silence. 
</P>
<P>
But some reaction to Hirohito's death was cool in South Korea, which endured 
years of harsh colonial rule by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
While South Korean President Roh Tae Woo sent his condolences, a government 
party statement added, "We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy 
past and the current Korea-Japan relationship." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condolences From China 
</P>
<P>
China extended condolences, and Taiwan said it will send a delegation to the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's daily United Evening News said: 
</P>
<P>
"It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe 
for the war, he did not direct a single word to China to show his sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Most historians believe Hirohito was a powerless figurehead but had approved 
orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and put most of East Asia under 
an often brutal Japanese rule. Hirohito called on his nation to surrender in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor's death drew mixed reaction in the Netherlands, which lost more 
than 20,000 people under Japan's wartime occupation of the former Dutch East 
Indies.

The government said it sent its sympathy for "the loss that has befallen the 
Japanese people," without mentioning the name of Hirohito, branded a war 
criminal by survivors of the wartime occupation of the colony that became 
Indonesia in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come to an end," said 
Gen. Ruud Boekholt, chairman of the Aug. 15 Commemoration Foundation, a group 
representing 127,000 Dutch citizens who underwent Japanese internment. 
</P>
<P>
"Daily, they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that was inflicted on 
them in the name of Emperor Hirohito," Boekholt said. 
</P>
<P>
But Indonesian President Suharto cabled his condolences to Crown Prince 
Akihito, Hirohito's eldest son who immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum 
Throne, and said he will personally pay last respects to Hirohito, presidential 
spokesman Moerdiono said. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to Hirohito's 
family, the Vatican said.

STATE CONTROLLER, LOTTERY AT ODDS OVER PROBE OF KEY LOTTO CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The state controller and the California lottery are at odds over what began as 
a joint investigation into accusations of wrongdoing by the lottery's main 
contractor in the Lotto numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
The controller's office, distancing itself from the lottery's finding that all 
is well with the Lotto contractor, GTECH Corp., is launching a separate, 
broader audit of the lottery, said Edd H. Fong, spokesman for Controller Gray 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the dispute, the report on the investigation by the lottery and 
controller, scheduled for release a month ago, will not come out at least until 
this week, and the controller will issue a separate statement when the report 
is issued, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fong said the controller's office agreed with the lottery that the audit 
produced no evidence of wrongdoing by GTECH, which has a $100-million-plus 
contract to run California's Lotto 6/49 game. But the controller contends that 
there may be insufficient oversight by the lottery of the Providence, R.I., 
company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report's Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
As the report is now written, there is no mention of a need for more monitoring 
of GTECH, said Roland Bowns, the lottery's chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Fong said the controller would not endorse a December draft of the report 
because "the lottery wanted to put in some (inappropriate) personnel 
information regarding two employees who made the allegations." 
</P>
<P>
"When it got to the point where the lottery people wanted to include some 
information that we felt was inappropriate, we were no longer involved in the 
drafting of the report," Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to an already touchy situation, Randy Troxel and Emmitt A. Allison, the 
lottery computer technicians who raised questions that led to the GTECH 
investigation, have sued the lottery, contending that they have suffered 
on-the-job retribution for coming forth. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 28, lottery officials proclaimed that a joint investigation by the 
controller and the lottery showed that accusations against GTECH were unfounded 
and said the report would be released during the first week of December. 
Lottery officials now say the report will not be released at least until this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that the controller needs to sign off on the report," Bowns said. 
"It was an investigation requested by the director of the lottery. Certainly, 
the controller's input and presence is nice, for lack of a better word. But it 
is a report to the director of the lottery." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controller's Jurisdiction 
</P>
<P>
Lottery spokesman John Schade said the lottery invited the controller to join 
the audit to add to its credibility and because the office has jurisdiction 
over allegations of "loss of funds." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office reviewed the report last month and called 
for changes to "avoid litigation," Bowns said. The lottery's lawyer said a 
deputy attorney general expressed concern that the report as written may have 
violated "the rights of the informants," prompting the lottery to excise some 
language about Allison and Troxel. 
</P>
<P>
Allison and Troxel were hired as computer technicians in October, 1986, with an 
assignment to help monitor GTECH. They found what they thought was evidence 
that GTECH was routinely under-reporting the amount of time that Lotto computer 
terminals were working improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Under GTECH's contract with the lottery, the company must pay up to $4,000 a 
minute for each minute that the Lotto 6/49 computer system is not working and 
lesser amounts when individual terminals are not working. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Whistle-Blowers' Suit' 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Allison and Troxel say they 
reported their discovery to the lottery but were pressured to ignore it, 
prompting them to go to the controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Troxel and Allison alleged that when their superiors at the lottery learned 
that they had gone to the controller, they were placed on unpaid leave. They 
have since returned to work but have little responsibility, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Allison said that through its action against Troxel 
and himself, the lottery is telling its workers to "shut your mouth, close your 
eyes and draw your paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
GTECH, meanwhile, is pressuring the lottery to release the report. Pete 
Morrissey, senior GTECH vice president in charge of its California contract, 
said he wrote to the lottery in November asking that it intercede and get "the 
two Lotto boys to stop making the allegations." The lottery responded that it 
could not prevent them from speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize you can't stop people who feature themselves as whistle-blowers, but 
I think they should limit it (what they say) to the proper authorities," 
Morrissey said. 
</P>
<P>
Morrissey said that although the charges are "farfetched," contracts that GTECH 
won in Michigan and Illinois were delayed partly because of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly doesn't help the company's image to have this kind of thing go on 
and be protracted," Morrissey said.

STUDY WARNS OF TOXIC CHEMICAL LEVEL OFF COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A highly toxic chemical used to keep barnacles off boats was found in 
"alarmingly high" levels in mussels along the coast of Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego counties before it was banned for use on most boats last year, 
according to a state draft report. 
</P>
<P>
Testing for tributyltin -- a chemical used in paints to keep algae as well as 
barnacles off boat hulls -- began in 1986 as part of a larger annual study by 
the state's Mussel Watch, a program that uses mussels to test water quality in 
bays and along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
A second round of samples taken by Mussel Watch in late 1986 and early 1987 -- 
the latest date for which data is available -- showed "dramatic" increases of 
the compound in mussel tissue, according to the report, due for release next 
week. A copy of the report was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alarmingly High' 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986-87, alarmingly high traces of TBT in transplanted mussels were found 
at Richmond Inner Harbor, Monterey Bay, Port Hueneme, Marina del Rey, Los 
Angeles, Newport Bay and San Diego sites," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the level of TBT included 219% at the Richmond Inner Harbor in 
Contra Costa County, 112% at the Consolidated Slip in Los Angeles, 121% at the 
Newport Bay Upper Rhine Channel and 96% at the North Harbor Drive commercial 
basin in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
One TBT expert termed the Mussel Watch figures "interesting," but said the lag 
time in the samples fails to show the effects of a 1988 state ban of the 
compound for sport and pleasure boats, the major users of TBT-laced paints. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we have regulations on the books in California that should 
ameliorate the problem, and it's going to take a number of years -- at least 
five or 10 years -- to see if it works," said Edward D. Goldberg of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger Boats Exempt 
</P>
<P>
The state banned the use of TBT paints on boats with hulls measuring 81 feet or 
less; exempted are larger boats and those with aluminum hulls. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was enacted because of increasing scientific evidence that TBT was one 
of the most toxic substances ever introduced into coastal waters. The compound 
kills off barnacles and other organisms that attach themselves to hulls.

MURDER-FOR-HIRE SUSPECT BROUGHT TO L.A. FOR TRIAL

The woman accused of directing the murder-for-hire of New York theatrical 
producer Roy Radin was booked for investigation of murder after her extradition 
to Los Angeles from Florida, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Karen De Layne Greenberger, 41, known as "Lanie," arrived Friday from Florida, 
where she was arrested in early October for allegedly commissioning Radin's 
death in 1983, Sheriff's Deputy Detta Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger, formerly known as Elaine Jacobs, has been described by authorities 
as a West Coast cocaine dealer. She was in custody and scheduled to be 
arraigned Monday, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger, along with alleged triggermen William Molony Mentzer, Alex Lamota 
Marti and Robert Ulmer Lowe, could face the death penalty if convicted of 
murder with special circumstances. The complaint alleges that they killed Radin 
for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Radin was killed because he rebuffed efforts by Greenberger 
for payments she sought in connection with the financing of the 1984 movie, 
"The Cotton Club."

NONSMOKING ORDINANCE, SO FAR, PROVES TO BE NO HAZARD TO ECONOMIC HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where there's tobacco smoke, there's usually fire. But few sparks have ignited 
in the nearly six months since the San Diego County Board of Supervisors 
approved a tough ordinance that severely restricts smoking in restaurants and 
workplaces in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
County officials interpret the paucity of complaints -- from smokers, 
nonsmokers or businesses -- as evidence that the ordinance, widely regarded as 
one of the most stringent of its kind in the nation, is working. 
</P>
<P>
Some nonsmoking advocates and others, however, suggest that the ordinance's 
track record and potential long-term impact are still as hazy as the air in a 
room full of chain-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"The general impression is, so far, so good," said Debbie Kelley, program 
director of the local American Lung Assn. office. "But there's still a lot of 
uncertainty, particularly about the workplace. There, it's not very clear to 
anyone what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Doesn't Care 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for that uncertainty is that, because the law is limited to only 
the county's unincorporated region, it has attracted relatively little public 
attention -- much less, proponents say, than would a comparable ordinance in 
the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The problems associated with that low public profile have been compounded by 
the county's deliberately low-key enforcement of the measure, a style that 
stems as much from administrators' desire to avoid heavy-handed tactics as from 
budgetary constraints that make frequent inspections economically impractical. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that less than 5% of the affected individuals even know this law is 
on the books," said Bob Ottilie, a lawyer who represents a business group 
concerned about the city's consideration of a similar ordinance. "I don't doubt 
that most people who are aware of it are complying. But the real reason there 
have been so few complaints may be that it's been pretty invisible to this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that the ordinance is only a first step toward his goal 
of an eventually smoke-free environment in most public places, Supervisor Leon 
Williams, the measure's sponsor, argues that it 
</P>
<P>
already has made significant strides toward protecting nonsmokers from the 
annoyance and health hazards of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got a long way to go, but the ordinance has helped to raise the 
public's consciousness," Williams said. "I detect a difference in people's 
attitudes in terms of their willingness to light up a cigarette under someone 
else's nose. Even if it does nothing more than make smokers become a little 
more considerate toward nonsmokers, that's progress." 
</P>
<P>
Approved last July, the county ordinance requires restaurants to designate at 
least 50% of their indoor seating capacity as a no-smoking area. Previously, 
restaurants had been required to provide only enough no-smoking space to meet 
demand, a vague rule that allowed restaurateurs to establish their own 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also requires employers to ban smoking in shared work areas, 
prohibits smoking in private offices unless doors are closed and no nonsmokers 
are present, and requires hotels and motels to provide enough nonsmoking rooms 
to meet demand. Smoking also is prohibited in most health facilities, waiting 
areas and service lines in business establishments and public areas such as 
restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the fact that some businesses attract clienteles that include 
a large percentage of smokers, bars, lounges, bowling centers, pool halls and 
some other facilities were exempted from the 50% space requirement. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong nonsmoker, Williams explained that his primary motive in proposing 
the ordinance was drawn from the growing medical evidence on how the inhalation 
of smoke can harm the health of nonsmokers. Dr. David Burns, an associate 
professor at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, testified before the 
supervisors last summer that medical evidence suggests that as many as 3,000 
people die annually as a result of so-called "secondhand" smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to say people don't have the right to smoke," Williams said. 
"But they don't have the right to hurt other people in the process. . . . As a 
county, we're not trying to legislate anyone's behavior. Our thrust here is the 
public's health." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 25 Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Although county officials have received hundreds of inquiries about the 
ordinance since it took effect in August, there have been only 25 formal 
complaints -- a fact that they cite as proof of widespread public acceptance 
and compliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the number of complaints, the ordinance seems to be working," 
said Willie Pugh, a county health education associate who heads the enforcement 
effort. "We get a lot of calls asking us to interpret the ordinance, but actual 
complaints have been rare." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, suggest that the low number of complaints may also reflect the 
public's unwillingness to report violations -- or unfamiliarity with how to do 
so. Nonsmoking diners who believe that a restaurant has failed to set aside 
sufficient nonsmoking tables, for instance, might be more inclined to forget 
about the experience -- or to decide simply not to patronize the restaurant 
again -- than to file a complaint with the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although some restaurants have posted signs listing a county Health Department 
telephone number where suspected violations may be reported, many others simply 
post plain smoking and no-smoking signs. Under the ordinance, the wording and 
placement of such signs is at the business owners' discretion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violations Unreported 
</P>
<P>
The county's decision to rely primarily on voluntary compliance also is seen as 
a contributing factor to the low number of complaints. In the absence of 
regular enforcement inspections by county officials, many violations likely go 
unreported. 
</P>
<P>
"There probably are more violations than we hear about," Pugh conceded. "But 
they're not very blatant things, or they'd be reported." In addition, county 
health inspectors have begun checking compliance with the anti-smoking 
ordinance as part of their routine inspections of restaurants' sanitary 
standards, Pugh added. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints that have been received have been settled by telephone 
calls from Pugh's office to the businesses, followed up by letters asking 
compliance within 10 days and -- in a few cases -- on-site visits by county 
health staffers. Ordinance violators are subject to fines ranging from $50 for 
a first offense to $250 for the third and each subsequent violation within a 
year. To date, however, no legal action has been taken against any business. 
</P>
<P>
When the supervisors debated the ordinance last summer, representatives of the 
restaurant and hotel industry spoke in opposition to it, complaining that it 
would be an economic burden that could cost them smokers' business. Although 
county workers are charged with enforcing the measure, business officials 
complained that practical day-to-day enforcement would be their unwelcome 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most of those groups, although still not pleased with the ordinance, 
grudgingly admit that the economic and other difficulties posed by it have not 
been as severe as they feared. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to put it is it's something we can live with," said Paul 
McIntyre, executive director of the San Diego Restaurant Assn. "It's helped 
that the county hasn't been hard-nosed about enforcing it. The county's shown 
that it's not out to put anyone out of business over this." 
</P>
<P>
Many restaurant operators say that, aside from minor occasional grumbling from 
customers, they have heard no serious complaints from either smokers or 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Becker, the owner of Hernandez' Hideaway, 
</P>
<P>
alongside Lake Hodges, said that about two-thirds of his clientele smokes. 
Nevertheless, Becker said that "about 98% of the people we get here accept (the 
ordinance's restrictions) without complaining. Every couple weeks, you might 
get a gripe. But no major problems." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, George Nourani, the manager of Mille Fleurs, a posh Rancho Santa Fe 
restaurant, said most of his customers -- generally split about 2-to-1 in favor 
of nonsmokers -- have been "very accommodating, very cooperative." In 
particular, Nourani said, smokers have not complained about longer waits for 
tables in smoking areas or, on occasion, being seated in nonsmoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
Not all restaurateurs, however, are as sanguine about the ordinance, 
notwithstanding the lack of major problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another . . . law where government tells me how to run my 
business," said Dan DeLong, the manager of the T-Bone Family Restaurant in 
Lakeside. "But it's the law, so people go along with it, even though they might 
not like it. Such is life." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the county ordinance an "unfair, inequitable law that doesn't leave a 
good taste in everybody's mouth," Harry Florentine, manager of the San Diego 
Tavern and Restaurant Assn., said his organization is pondering a legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"You're infringing on rights when you get into a selective enforcement thing 
like this," Florentine said. Like some other restaurant representatives, 
Florentine expressed a preference for the county's previous ordinance over 
Williams' proposal, praising the earlier law's flexibility in allowing 
restaurateurs to "self-regulate by keeping the public happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Him Business 
</P>
<P>
Before last summer, restaurant owners could adjust the size of their smoking 
and nonsmoking sections to meet the needs of their customers at any particular 
time. But the 50% space requirement, Florentine and others argue, causes some 
seats in both smoking and nonsmoking areas to often go unused. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's gone bankrupt, but I'm sure this has cost some businesses money," 
Florentine said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the supervisors disagree with restaurateurs on that point, they 
conceded at the time they passed the ordinance that the 50% requirement would 
be impractical for certain businesses such as bars, cocktail lounges, bowling 
centers, card rooms and pool halls that attract many smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain establishments are inherently smoke-filled rooms," Supervisor Brian 
Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
The other exemptions to the ordinance include jails, stores that deal 
exclusively in tobacco products and accessories, hotel meeting rooms in use for 
private social functions, psychiatric facilities and drug clinics, and private 
offices assigned to a single person from which smoke cannot drift to no-smoking 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, businesses may apply for hardship exemptions. Of the three 
applications received since August, two have been approved -- one involving a 
jewelry store run by two handicapped Vietnam veterans and the other for a 
restaurant where patrons' entrance through the bar made it difficult to comply 
with the ordinance's requirement of smoke-free waiting areas. A Spring Valley 
beauty parlor was turned down in its request. 
</P>
<P>
Mirroring restaurants' experience, private employers have reported no major 
problems complying with the ordinance's ban on smoking in shared work areas. As 
a practical matter, that provision has resulted in many workplaces being 
declared entirely off limits to smokers, though employees are permitted to 
smoke behind closed doors in private offices when no nonsmokers are present. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wark, the division manager of Robertshaw Controls Co., said that the floor 
layout of the firm's Fallbrook factory left managers with little choice but to 
ban smoking inside the 330-employee plant. 
</P>
<P>
"At our place, if you're inside the building, you're in a shared work space," 
Wark said, chuckling. Though smokers now must go outside to smoke, "We haven't 
heard a bit of static about it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Small Firms 
</P>
<P>
The Lung Assn.'s Kelley, however, questions whether all businesses are 
complying with the ordinance, noting that most of the 5,800 businesses in the 
unincorporated areas are small firms with only a handful of employees. In such 
an environment, workers may be hesitant to report infractions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these businesses are family-run or close to it, so you'd feel almost 
like a traitor if you reported someone," Kelley said. Moreover, although 
employees who file complaints are guaranteed confidentiality to protect against 
retaliation by employers or co-workers, in most cases it would not be difficult 
for workers in a small office to determine the tipster, she added. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the specific numerical formulas or other provisions governing 
smoking in restaurants and workplaces, the ordinance establishes a more general 
guideline for hotels and motels, saying simply that there should be sufficient 
nonsmoking rooms to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Although there again have been no major complaints from hoteliers, Jim Durbin, 
chairman of the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn., said it is "too early for a 
verdict" on how the measure has affected his industry. Like restaurateurs, 
hotel owners are concerned about any arbitrary standards that could force rooms 
to remain vacant, though that has not been a problem to date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignored by Other Cities 
</P>
<P>
One major disappointment felt by Williams and other supporters of the county 
measure is that, contrary to their hopes, the ordinance has not yet been copied 
by cities throughout the county. At the time of the measure's passage, the 
county sent letters to the 18 local incorporated cities urging them to adopt 
similar measures. To date, however, none have. 
</P>
<P>
County health official Pugh, however, said he believes that many smaller cities 
are waiting to see how the city of San Diego handles the issue early this year. 
A city task force has been reviewing the county's anti-smoking measure for 
several months and is expected to forward its recommendations to the council 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's the key," Pugh said. "If San Diego goes along with it, I think 
you'll start to see action from the other cities too." 
</P>
<P>
And Williams, who in the past often complained about "getting a lung full of 
smoke" even while walking down the halls of the County Administration Center, 
said that the issue has to be evaluated from a long-range perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"On such an emotional issue, you're not going to change thinking overnight," 
Williams said. "But this is an important step, because it clearly shifts the 
momentum toward nonsmokers. This is a gradual process, and we still have a lot 
of educating to do. Still, every time you go to work or a restaurant and aren't 
exposed to smoke, you can tell -- and smell -- that we're moving in the right 
direction."

BEST SHOT FOR U.S. IS ALWAYS KADAFI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Survey.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the Pentagon it was a fair fight, U.S. Navy jets responding to an obvious 
provocation. Not surprisingly, Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi did not see things 
this way. He cried foul, accusing the United States of acting the bully -- 
shooting down unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. To others, notably European and 
Arab leaders who have watched repeated rounds of U.S.-Libyan sparring with 
growing distaste and apprehension, when U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan 
fighters on Wednesday it was yet another example of the American obsession with 
the Libyan strongman. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, during the eight-year Reagan presidency, Kadafi did become, in one 
Administration official's words, "The man we love to hate -- and hit." 
</P>
<P>
But Kadafi did not become Ronald Reagan's bete noire for unfounded reasons. On 
the contrary, the mercurial Libyan leader has an uncanny knack for embracing 
just those causes certain to inflame and ultimately provoke the United States. 
This time, he may even have sought an aerial dogfight to stave off what he 
thought was going to be a major air strike. "It's better to lose a couple of 
MiGs than to lose a chemical weapons plant," a senior Pentagon official 
speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Libya also provides a safe target -- unlike other radical Middle Eastern 
states. Syria, for example, while equally involved in supporting international 
terrorism and amassing chemical weapons, has nonetheless proved to be much less 
inviting. It has the Soviet Union as its secure patron, a well-equipped 
military and a central geographic location. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's preoccupation with Libya was evident from the earliest days of his 
Administration. In 1981, his first secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr., 
declared that combating terrorism would be the Reagan Administration's crusade 
as much as human-rights activism had been Jimmy Carter's. And within nine 
months the first shooting incident between the United States and Libya occurred 
-- two Libyan planes were shot down. 
</P>
<P>
Five years passed before the Administration's war on terrorism would turn hot 
-- and against Libya -- but economic and political pressure were constantly 
increasing. The April, 1986, attack on Libya's capital of Tripoli, which almost 
took Kadafi's life, was therefore meant to be the final act. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi survived the raid and, more important, the domestic political turmoil 
that followed. Reagan Administration planners were disappointed. Still they 
took solace in knowing that Kadafi had at least been chastened. His support for 
international terrorism dramatically decreased. Even today Libyan involvement 
is recorded at far below 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
But now it turns out that as far as the United States is concerned, Kadafi 
merely shifted from one unacceptable form of behavior to another. The scourge 
of international terrorism -- as the Pan American bombing so tragically 
illustrates -- is still present. But it has been superseded -- at least in the 
view of U.S. officials -- by the specter of widespread chemical warfare. 
Kadafi, with his new chemical plant, again provides the unmistakable -- and 
tangible -- target. 
</P>
<P>
According to Administration sources, the Libyans are building the largest 
chemical weapons facility outside the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Actually, Germans and Japanese are building the complex for the Libyans. "The 
Japanese may have been duped," said one U.S. official. They are constructing a 
metalworks factory able to supply munitions for the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
But the Germans are displaying an expertise revealed when they enabled Syria to 
develop a sophisticated chemical-weapons capability more than a year ago. "The 
Germans are the technicians. Their role is crucial," said a State Department 
expert. Anger with the Germans among some State Department officials is 
palpable, "If we do take out the Libyan plant," said one man, "there should be 
no apologies for German nationals killed." 
</P>
<P>
It is the proliferation of chemical weapons -- first to Iraq, then to Syria and 
now to Libya -- that gives the issue its urgency. Introducing chemical weapons 
to the volatile Middle East is to almost guarantee their use, say State 
Department analysts. In fact, the weapons have already been used on a major 
scale during the recent Iran-Iraq War. Chemical weapons gave Iraq a crucial 
edge in the final stages of the war; after a truce was declared, the Iraqis 
used chemical weapons on their own rebellious Kurdish minority. "Chemical 
weapons are like anything else, each time you do it, it gets easier," commented 
a State Department Middle East expert. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its battlefield experience, the Iraqi army has the dubious 
distinction of being the most adept practitioner of chemical warfare in the 
world today, say U.S. experts. Israeli officials fear that their Syrian enemies 
are catching up. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria also have rudimentary missile systems capable of delivering 
chemical weapons far distances. Kadafi's Libya, by contrast, has no delivery 
system other than by, as one U.S. expert said, "rolling some drums out of the 
back of an airplane." Moreover, with its small standing army, there is little 
chance Libya will ever incorporate chemical warfare into a strategic doctrine 
as Iraq has done, and as Syria is suspected of doing now. 
</P>
<P>
So then, why all the fuss about Libya? Could it be -- as many Arabs and 
Europeans are saying -- that bashing Kadafi is safer than going after more 
formidable but no less culpable Iraq and Syria? Is there truth to the charge 
made last week by one State Department analyst? -- "If Kadafi didn't exist we 
would have to invent him." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials admit they have a problem with consistency. "Kadafi is by 
no means the leader in chemical warfare," said a State Department analyst. "He 
is just once again the most blatant." 
</P>
<P>
But a range of U.S. experts see special risks in the possibility of a major 
chemical-weapons capability coming under the control of an unstable figure like 
Kadafi. "We are talking here about a fearless, feckless flake," said Douglas J. 
Feith, the Pentagon official in charge of chemical-weapons policy from 
1984-1986. Feith advocates using force against Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
Those now in the Reagan Administration are more circumspect. But they, too, say 
Kadafi must be singled out for diplomatic if not military pressure. "The Iraqis 
have a full-blown program. It can't be affected," said a State Department 
official. "But we can do something about the Libyans. They are still dependent 
on foreign expertise." Another key U.S. official is equally adamant. "There is 
a distinction between Kadafi and other Arab leaders. He is simply not 
responsible. So someone must become responsible for him." 
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns about Kadafi are what he would do with an enormous stockpile 
of chemical weapons that this new facility is capable of producing. "He thinks 
it's the weapon of the future," said a State Department expert. This analyst 
see Kadafi as a triple threat -- he might use it himself, give it to terrorists 
or to another state. A possible recipient, according to one well-connected 
intelligence official, is the East African country of Somalia, now being wooed 
by Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
However, each day these matters become more speculative to senior 
Administration officials. With less than two weeks left in Reagan's term, these 
officials are letting it be known that despite the latest fire fight they are 
not planning any aggressive action against Libya. That would be left for the 
next Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But if George Bush's campaign pronouncements are to be believed, dealing with 
chemical weapons, will, if anything, soon become of even greater import. 
Judging by prior performance, Kadafi probably knows that already.

HUMAN RIGHTS VERSUS STATE NEEDS: THE FRANCO-AMERICAN CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Glidden, David Glidden is a professor of philosophy at UC Riverside. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two epochal events in the course of human rights happened almost simultaneously 
200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly approved the Declaration of the Rights of Man on 
Aug. 26, 1789, shortly after the Bastille had been stormed by mobs looking for 
weapons. On Sept. 25 that same year, the new Congress of the United States 
approved the Bill of Rights, in the form of 10 amendments to the Constitution. 
One document marked the beginning of a revolution, the other ratified the 
resolution of a revolutionary war. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1989 various bicentennial celebrations are planned, to commemorate 
the common concern for civil rights in both the United States and France, but 
differences are worth noting, too. Governing philosophies affect nations, just 
as revolutions do. 
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly did not include common people, but clerics, 
aristocrats and bourgeoisie. And the declaration they framed was written with 
some apprehension about the coming terror in the streets. Consequently, many of 
the rights proclaimed were qualified by duties expected of citizens. First and 
foremost, men were declared both free and equal, but social distinctions were 
said to be acceptable when useful. And to this day privileged Parisians proudly 
accept their social standing as the patrimony of the nation. Otherwise, who 
would set the poor a good example? Freedom of religion was guaranteed, but not 
to the extent it might disturb the public order, as defined by government. 
Freedom of speech was similarly subject to constraints imposed by law, to guard 
against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty was taken from the sovereign and given to the nation as a whole. 
But there were provisos written into the rights of man, to keep individuality 
constrained. Equality before the law replaced arbitrariness of government but 
government would evaluate the interests of the people and impose limits on 
freedoms and on fairness whenever necessary. The nation's interest, under law, 
superseded that of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
The common welfare of the nation has generally prevailed as the governing 
philosophy in France. Elected officials and well-educated functionaries are 
guided by what they take to be the best interests of the state. So, nuclear 
weapons are exploded on Pacific atolls, without the consent of native 
islanders, and Greenpeace warriors are murdered in the name of France. Actions 
that foreigners abhor are seen to be a duty, serving the interests of the 
nation. It is a philosophy that has proved popular to Francophiles. It has also 
inspired chauvinism. Every philosophy of government is double-edged; this is 
France's sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bill of Rights was founded on a different, "don't tread on me" 
philosophy, where the rights of man superseded duties to the nation. Unlike the 
French declaration, Congress imposed rights without restrictions. No laws would 
be countenanced constraining religion, freedom of the press or speech. The 
right of persons to assemble peaceably -- even to complain about the government 
-- was absolute. The right of citizens to keep and bear arms was not to be 
infringed. And the Ninth Amendment endorsed all other rights belonging to the 
people, in addition to those not spelled out in the Constitution. The 
Constitution could be changed, of course, but short of amending these 
amendments the welfare of the nation could not take precedence over the 
privileges of persons. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining items in the Bill of Rights were largely procedural protections, 
guaranteeing individuals their day in court, similar to legal rights being 
guaranteed in France. Finally, the 10th Amendment insisted that except for 
powers explicitly written into the Constitution, the powers of the people and 
of the separate states were sacrosanct. This same philosophy was soon embraced 
by the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson as self-reliant conservatism -- 
a philosophy suspicious of officials. 
</P>
<P>
Our unrestricted freedoms have come to include far more than the Founding 
Fathers bargained for: pornographic movies, Nazis marching in the streets and 
ghetto gangs packing submachine guns. The result of such excesses has produced 
a philosophic friction. 
</P>
<P>
Today's conservatives enthusiastically embrace self-reliance but seek to 
override the Constitution when it comes to pornography and unwelcome 
demonstrations, while at the same time invoking constitutional protection to 
sell weapons. And the American Civil Liberties Union, which favors an 
interventionist philosophy, finds itself engaged in defending self-reliance, 
with lawsuits over creches, crosses and menorahs displayed in public places, 
not to mention defending the right of the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate. Both 
conservatives and liberals invoke "don't tread on me" selectively. It's getting 
hard to tell who is on the side of what. 
</P>
<P>
About the time Emerson was writing "Self-Reliance," Alexis de Tocqueville 
observed how our form of government enhances the political power of those 
lawyers who "do not, indeed, wish to overthrow the institutions of democracy, 
but they constantly endeavor to turn it away from its real direction by means 
which are foreign to its nature." Certainly, our procedural freedoms have been 
abused by those who can afford sufficiently enterprising lawyers to exploit 
their clients' Fourth through Eighth Amendment rights, just as our freedoms of 
religion, speech and assembly sometimes turn democracy into a circus of con men 
all petitioning the courts. It can even make you want to emigrate to France. 
</P>
<P>
Homespun philosophies never exactly fit the individuals they're designed to 
suit; the same is true of ideologies. What is required is not to abandon all 
political philosophy, but to recognize the limited vision of our principles and 
to compensate for them with some common sense. 
</P>
<P>
France faces the problem of sufficiently ignoring the nation's interest to 
respect the rights of individuals, to counter state chauvinism, to be tolerant 
of human differences. The United States faces an opposite dilemma, to protect 
whole segments of society against the power of self-interested individuals, be 
they common criminals or financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Just as France must restrain its intervention, we often need to intervene 
through legislation to accommodate the limitations of the Bill of Rights. 
"Don't tread on me" does not do much for those who are already trodden on: the 
ignorant, the homeless, the disabled and the poor -- those who cannot rely upon 
themselves. The Bill of Rights does not include economic guarantees to live the 
kinds of lives that would make those rights worthwhile. For this reason, the 
14th Amendment intervened to provide equal protection under law to supplement 
equality before the law. Compassion is the common cure for ideology. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain naivete to any grand design of government. When the 
Declaration of Independence proclaimed "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of 
Happiness," it also chastised the king of England for not suppressing 
insurrections among the "merciless Indian savages." Unfortunately, perfect 
social progress cannot be mandated by courts or guaranteed by legislation or 
brought about by manifesto and revolution. It is, after all, a government of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson's self-reliance sided with the skeptics. France's National Assembly 
took the opposite approach and thought of the state as a god. Neither 
philosophy faced up to the limits of its vision. Neither the Declaration of the 
Rights of Man nor the Bill of Rights addressed the difference between civil 
liberties and those rights that know no borders and no country.

'OUTRAGE IN WAR ON GUNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Outrage Is Ammo in the War on Guns," Part I, Dec. 28: 
</P>
<P>
Every time I hear another gun lobby member defending his/her right to bear 
weapons such as the AK-47 assault rifle I get nauseous. These guns are not made 
for hunting, target shooting or any sport. Assault rifles, by definition, are 
offensive weapons. They are the equivalent to first-strike nuclear weapons: 
They are designed for those who choose to start a fight, not to defend. 
</P>
<P>
"Foul!" cries the gun lobby. "It's not the guns that kill people, it's people 
who kill people." This misguided, hollow argument has been around too long. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, someone has to point the gun and pull the trigger. And we certainly 
must do everything in our power to eradicate the circumstances that produce 
individuals capable of killing people. But will someone please tell me how 
controlling the tool of destruction, in this case a gun, is any different from 
President Reagan's admirable policy of trying to stop the flow of drugs? Sure, 
we must work tirelessly to control the temptation. But, we must also make at 
least some, however small, dent in the accessibility of certain kinds of 
weapons just as we must continue to slow the flow of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be no more effective than Prohibition," say the gun lobbyists. Does 
anyone really believe this? Just guessing, I'd say 50,000 assault weapons were 
sold last year. Even if it was 150,000 you could not call assault-weapon 
ownership a national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, nobody wants to see bullets fly through cars to kill 
people. The rigid control of these weapons is a public good, and that, my 
economics professor tells me, is the ultimate democratic policy. We must try.

I cannot believe that suffering needs proper English or Spanish to be

Further, I cannot understand why we continue to pretend that a working

Perhaps, if some status points were applied to the speaking of Spanish, being

ARRIVAL SIGNS

<P>
Picking up someone at Los Angeles International Airport when you are alone in 
the car can be traumatic. There is no way to tell whether or not the flight you 
are meeting is on time except to leave your car at the curb and enter the 
terminal. By the time you've done this, your car will be ticketed by security. 
I have a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Why couldn't the airlines put up a computerized sign outside their terminals 
for motorists to view? This sign would designate the arrivals for say, 30 
minutes, telling the on-time and late arrivals.

WASHINGTON PAY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the mere mention of a pay raise, members of Congress start behaving like 
actors in a French farce. On the floor of the House or the Senate, they make 
impassioned speeches saying that they don't need a raise, though most of them 
privately concede that they do. They call press conferences to announce that 
they don't even deserve a raise, despite the incontrovertible findings of the 
Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries that the lawmakers' 
pay -- like the salaries of Cabinet members, federal judges and top civil 
servants -- has lost 35% of its buying power since 1969. And then, finally, the 
legislators find some complicated way to give themselves a raise while vowing 
that they never intended that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly the script now being followed as Congress contemplates a 
sensible and overdue 50% pay increase proposed by the commission and fully 
endorsed by President Reagan. Bills have been introduced to stop the raise or 
at least to postpone it for two years. Alliances have been struck between 
showboating members of Congress and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whose 
opposition to the pay raise rates attention because, novelty of novelties, it 
is genuine. The pay raise will go into effect automatically on Feb. 9 unless 
both houses of Congress reject it by a majority vote before then. Leading 
senators boast that the Senate will never approve such a hefty raise for 
itself. But, rest assured, they'll all get their money: The House leadership 
has arranged to delay any vote in that chamber until Feb. 10, after the 
deadline has passed, when the anticipated overwhelming rejection of the raise 
will mean nothing. 
</P>
<P>
What's troubling is that while this farce plays itself out, Congress isn't 
paying enough attention to a related issue: getting rid of honorariums, those 
corrupting payments that members receive from special-interest groups for 
making speeches or just showing up for breakfast. The pay commission 
recommended that, in exchange for a 50% raise, lawmakers ban the speaking fees 
and other payments that can add up to 40% to their salaries. So far there has 
been no sign that Congress has developed a sure-fire, air-tight strategy to 
eliminate honorariums in all their myriad forms. Outside Washington, where 
folks have a surer grasp on reality and the honorariums look very much like 
bribes, a pay raise without an absolute ban on honorariums really will arouse 
the voters.

REACHING THE SMOKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoking, says a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., is increasingly becoming class-concentrated, with the poorer and less 
educated far more likely to become or remain smokers than those who have a 
college education. Writing in the journal on the 25th anniversary of the 
surgeon general's first report on the health effects of smoking, researchers 
report that in 1985 more than 34% of non-high-school graduates were still 
smokers, compared with little more than 18% of people with college degrees. Dr. 
Michael C. Fiore, one of the report's authors, thinks that a major reason for 
this lopsided ratio may be that most information about smoking's dangers "has 
been geared toward people with sophisticated medical knowledge." The need, he 
suggests, is to begin refocusing informational efforts to reach the less aware. 
</P>
<P>
What's unhappily clear is that even the strongest educational program won't 
achieve Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's goal of a "smoke-free society" by the 
end of the century. Each year about 1.3 million Americans quit smoking. But 
each day about 3,000 take up the habit for the first time. This represents 
progress of a sort, since between the quitters and those who die from 
smoking-related diseases -- 300,000 annually, says the surgeon general -- a net 
reduction does occur. It's still appalling that 1 million Americans, almost all 
of them young and an increasing percentage of them female, become new smokers 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Warning labels on cigarette packages have been shown to be of almost no 
deterrent value, and messages about the perils of smoking that are directed at 
better-educated readers, like this editorial, don't reach the nost needful 
audience. The best way to inform the part of the population that so far has 
been least affected by anti-smoking warnings is probably in the classroom, and 
early. There was a time, when our society was less affluent and less educated, 
when elementary schools were the accepted vehicle for providing basic 
information about personal hygiene. Smoking remains the nation's primary 
preventable cause of death and disease. The sooner young people are made aware 
of that, the better the chances they will say no the enticements of tobacco 
companies, and so have the chance to lead healthier lives.

.. . AND HIS CLEAN-AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley's list of 63 steps toward cleaner air for the city of Los 
Angeles is a recent example of the way he is blending good politics and good 
government these days. 
</P>
<P>
The list was put together under duress in an effort to satisfy the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency that Los Angeles is serious about fighting 
smog, but that fact does not detract from the basic good sense of the list 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, many of the proposals deal with eliminating a need for travel 
between work and home -- something that also would eliminate smog. One step 
toward that goal would be to require developers of office space to build 
housing at the same time and in the same general neighborhood as the office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another transportation proposal would eliminate most free parking in the city, 
including spaces at big shopping malls, except for car and van pools and for 
cars that park so that drivers and passengers can transfer to public transit. 
The concept is that high parking charges discourage commuters from traveling 
alone, thus getting more efficient use of every lane of highway and freeway. 
</P>
<P>
New construction would be concentrated along the route of Metro Rail and in 
busy bus corridors, again allowing growth in floor space without a need for 
growth in transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the best thing about the list is that it makes it easier to see on 
a smaller scale than the entire four-county air basin how little people will 
have to change the way they live in order to get cleaner air. As with the rest 
of City Hall's new look, the list is just a collection of ideas. Translating 
them into law is the job by which the mayor will be judged in the future.

THE PECULIAR PERSISTENCE OF ORIGINAL INTENT; 
</P>
<P>
ORIGINAL INTENT AND THE FRAMERS' CONSTITUTION BY LEONARD W. LEVY (MACMILLAN: 
$19.95; 525 PP.; 0-02-918791-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher D. Stone, USC law professor Stone's latest book is Earth and 
Other Ethics (Harper &amp; Row). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Across the world, hermeneutics, the art of drawing meaning from text, is 
serious business. Airplanes are hijacked, mosques besieged, rock-throwing 
youngsters raked with plastic bullets, all because somebody is sure he has got 
the right read on some ancient document. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is inherent in authority. The authority, be it God or king or 
Congress, has to communicate. And someone has to divine the meaning -- whether 
from ad hoc messages, such as entrails or earthquakes; from regular, holistic 
patterns, such as planetary motion; or, more modernly, in societies whose 
authorities find it easier to speak than to move mountains, from words. 
</P>
<P>
In our own nation, the fundamental document, our secular scripture, is the 
Constitution. The chief interpreters, our high priesthood, are our Supreme 
Court justices. Our home-grown fundamentalist wing, for which derailed Supreme 
Court nominee Robert Bork has been the most celebrated spokesperson, holds 
that, where ascertainable, the "original intent" of the Constitution's enactors 
ought to control. 
</P>
<P>
In "Original Intent and the Framers' Constitution," historian Leonard W. Levy, 
a leading authority on the minds and milieu of the Framers, has produced a 
well-documented debunking of the originalist position. Levy demonstrates that 
notwithstanding the repeated lip service courts pay to the Framers' "original 
intent," judges have been generally indifferent to the fragmentary, often 
conflicting historical evidence of what that intent actually was. Levy twits 
that if the history really were so important, Congress should create an Office 
of Historian to the Supreme Court, rather than piece out partisan "histories" 
from the briefs of us squabbling lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Levy's potential audience may be turned off at the prospect of yet one 
more public whipping of the naive claim that judges do nothing more than carry 
out the "intent" (or "letter") of the lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be a mistake to devalue this facet of Levy's book on the view that 
it is old hat. Even readers familiar with the critical literature, and who 
think themselves well-versed on their constitutional history, will be rewarded 
by Levy's meticulous and entertaining exposition of the court's continuous 
meanderings. 
</P>
<P>
Levy is persuasive that the tampering with original understanding has reached 
into the very structure of government. The most distinguishing and awesome 
feature of our modern judiciary, the power of federal courts to overrule acts 
of Congress, was sprung on us by Chief Justice John Marshall, our first-seated 
"rampaging activist," because he -- not the drafters -- thought good government 
required it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more arresting is Levy's implication that the Framers -- 
Marshall's contemporaries -- probably would not have objected that their own 
intentions went unconsulted. Levy claims that there is "no evidence, not a 
shred . . . to show that the Framers meant, wanted, or expected future 
generations to construe the Constitution as they . . . had." 
</P>
<P>
But if the Framers did not intend their intentions to bind us, and if the 
courts have, in fact, played as fast and loose with intent as Levy says they 
have, then that only underscores the normative question that animated the Bork 
hearings: Why not just scuttle the pretense? 
</P>
<P>
The mystery is deepened because even Levy, for all his disparagement of 
original intent talk, stops short of renouncing it entirely. On the other hand, 
he proclaims the text to be "the most important evidence of original intent," 
which must prevail "when it surely embodies a broader principle than can be 
found in the minds or purposes of the Framers." But, why? Both positions 
deserve some connection to a theory of government. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this opens up a huge and treacherous area. I can do little more than 
suggest that there is more to be said for original intent than Levy lets on. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, trying to figure out what the speaker meant is the commonly 
accepted method for clarifying unclear messages in everyday life. Why not apply 
it to a constitutional communication, where solid evidence of intent is 
available? 
</P>
<P>
Second, many of the negative answers to that question are, on close 
examination, off the mark. Levy adopts the common criticism that "even if the 
Court could discover original intent, it would freeze the meaning of the 
Constitution as it was two centuries ago," rendering it unsuitable "to serve 
for ages to come." 
</P>
<P>
This is not so. If the original understanding were to become too stultifying, 
we could escape the enactors' grip by amending the Constitution (the way we 
enacted, then repealed Prohibition). Original intent does not imply inalterable 
dead-hand control. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does one have to amend the document to avoid a frozen set of applications. 
It depends not only upon the texture of the intention in question, but on how 
intent is construed in general. 
</P>
<P>
Take for illustration the copyright clause (Article I, Section 8) which gives 
protection, literally, only to "authors and inventors." A literal 
interpretation, Levy points out, would deny protection to artists and 
sculptors, and to those producing all sorts of modern innovations, such as 
television, radio and computer programming. Levy thrusts: "Original intent 
analysis leads nowhere, because the records of the Convention show nothing, and 
the ratification debates do not assist either." 
</P>
<P>
In rejoinder, a passage of Wittgenstein (from "Philosophical Investigations") 
is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
Someone says to me: "Show the children a game." I teach them gaming with dice, 
and the other says, "I didn't mean that sort of game." Must the exclusion of 
the game of dice have come before his mind when he gave me the order? 
</P>
<P>
I believe most lawyers would respond that teaching the children dice would not 
be faithful to the speaker's intended meaning, even if the speaker did not have 
some sort of diceless mental picture "in mind," originally. This is because 
lawyers are accustomed to constructing intent in all sorts of contexts, 
including contracts, wills, crimes, and legislative interpretation, and in none 
of them is the task imagined to focus on finding little pictures the speakers 
or writers were carrying around in their heads. Hence, whatever intent may mean 
to a historian, lawyers are skeptical about the whole business of pinning down 
what-the-speaker-actually-meant, and habituated to throw on a good gloss of 
what, in the social context, he or she or the reasonable person so situated 
should have meant. 
</P>
<P>
This pragmatic, but structured concept of intent explains why lawyers are 
unembarrassed to speak of the "intent" of a collective body, such as a 
legislative assembly or constitutional convention, even though we know it was 
composed of many individual minds that differed. And it helps put in 
perspective, too, Levy's complaint that "lawyers making a historical point will 
cite a Court opinion as proof, but no competent historian would do that." 
Indeed; but the lawyer, no fool, is doing law -- and using "intent" in a way 
that is closer to Wittgenstein's. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Levy acknowledges that he has made no effort to be systematic, but has 
chosen to focus provisions that he considers interesting, important, and 
frequently litigated -- those that are therefore the most uncertain. 
Undeniably, a more balanced survey would turn up a whole slew of provisions, 
such as that the President must be 35 years of age, for which the intent and 
wording are so clear as to assure the continuing influence of the Founders. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Levy's response is indisputable: In the cases that do give trouble, no 
theory "will crank out decisions . . . so likely true or convincing that all 
the justices will agree." But all too readily he goes beyond that, to suggest 
that original intent analysis is "meaningless," "leads nowhere," and does not 
even "give guides to decision." Depending, again, upon how intent is conceived, 
those, the really crucial claims, are tougher to support. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that changes the final verdict: We will all be better historians 
for Leonard Levy's fine new book.

THE RICHEST MAN IN SPAIN;

THE CITY OF MARVELS BY EDUARDO MENDOZA; TRANSLATED BY BERNARD MOLLOY (HARCOURT

As the Catalonians see it, it's no accident that their capital city, Barcelona, 
will be hosting the Summer Olympics in 1992. Historically the most enterprising 
and cosmopolitan corner of Spain, Catalonia took the Republican side in the 
Spanish Civil War and paid the price in brutal reprisals and decades of 
political and cultural repression. Now, a dozen years after the death of 
Franco, Catalonia is at the forefront of the resurgence of regional identity in 
Spain, and the verve of its revival has been captured in a novel by Eduardo 
Mendoza called "The City of Marvels." Though historical in subject matter, this 
story of Catalonian enterprise and Barcelonan ambition is thoroughly 
contemporary in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1886, as Barcelona frantically prepares for its first World's Fair, we meet 
the novel's central character, Onofre Bouvila, who, unable to find any better 
job, is being paid by anarchists to distribute seditious literature. With 
chilly purposefulness, Onofre moves from selling revolution to selling 
hair-restorer, then on to pilfering from Fair exhibits and enforcing for 
organized crime, aided throughout by various comic grotesques -- a virile 
giant, a drag queen, a repulsive chambermaid with a cat named Beelzebub. 
Occasionally, as during a gang war that paralyzes Barcelona for a week, the 
narrative gathers terrific momentum and almost succeeds in making Onofre 
sympathetic as he prepares to make his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Of the actual amassing of this fortune disappointingly little is shown -- a few 
nifty real estate swindles, some hired hits, some passing years, some arms 
sales in World War I. Onofre doesn't grow in character so much as simply become 
amplified. In his capacity as "the richest man in Spain," he leads a life 
replete with the whims, the cars, the girls, the airplane rides, the twisted 
family life, and especially the hunger for still more that we expect from such 
a phenomenon. It's all fairly interesting, but when the book ends, with the 
launching of Barcelona's second World's Fair in 1929, what lingers is not the 
memory of a real Onofre Bouvila but only the spirit of the hard, flamboyant era 
he represents. 
</P>
<P>
Paralleling this rags-to-riches story is a popular history of Barcelona, 
beginning with an account of early Barcelonans admiring Hannibal's elephants -- 
"Just look at those tusks, those ears, that trunk or proboscis, they remarked" 
-- and ending with a foreshadowing of the city's suffering under Franco. 
Mendoza digresses and embroiders with supreme confidence. The lives of saints 
and anarchists are deftly woven in, and Mata Hari is ushered through the book 
to explain why "Quo Vadis," the world's first feature-length movie, never made 
it to Spain. Just as often, though, for example in dull cameo appearances by 
Lenin and Rasputin, Mendoza's touch is so light as to make no impression at 
all. Frequent quotations from period newspapers, intended to cast sidelights on 
the march of history, seem instead to cast unwelcome light on the author's 
research methods. And though modern-day Catalonians may find fascinating his 
account of Barcelona's architectural growing pains, the impartial reader 
working through the 10th dense page of it may be forgiven for asking: Is this 
book for me? 
</P>
<P>
To the extent that Mendoza tries at all to answer this question and find 
general truth in specific history, he does it as a cynic, highlighting in every 
anecdote the ugly, the venal, the ridiculous, the cruel. At his best, he rises 
to a limpid honesty of vision: 
</P>
<P>
"With the thaw a tribe of Gypsies appeared, walking along the beach. The 
workers' wives stood in the doors of their huts to block entry, for it was 
widely believed that Gypsy women stole infants. This tribe was actually just 
doing what it could to earn its daily bread by mending pans, clipping dogs, 
telling fortunes, and making bears dance. The workers, having no pans, no dogs, 
and no futures, were interested only in seeing the bears dance. And so it was 
that the Civil Guard had to intervene." 
</P>
<P>
But even a tone as satisfying as this gets old if it isn't modulated. And 
although Mendoza at every turn protects his flanks politically by presenting 
the masses as an unsentimental and undifferentiated martyr class, the world of 
the novel remains the world of Onofre Bouvila, devoid of kindness and charity 
and beauty, devoid of redeeming characters, devoid even of complicated ones. To 
depict an entire epoch in this way is arrogant if we're meant to believe the 
world has improved since then; profoundly diminishing if we're meant to believe 
it hasn't. It's true that after two millennia of jealous persecution, Barcelona 
and its chroniclers have earned the right to cynicism and also, having in 
triumph outlasted yet another dictatorship, the right to a little arrogance. 
Yet despite its intermittent virtuosity, and despite Bernard Molloy's able 
translation, an American reading "The City of Marvels" may well feel like the 
only foreign guest at a Catalonian all-class reunion.

1898: THE CONQUEST OF CUBA; 
</P>
<P>
REMEMBER SANTIAGO BY DOUGLAS C. JONES (HENRY HOLT: $18.95; 354 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Schorr, Schorr is the author of Bully, a historical mystery featuring 
Theodore Roosevelt as the protagonist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
War is stupid and ugly, and often fought for the basest of political reasons. 
The message is not new, but novelist Douglas C. Jones skillfully portrays one 
of our stupidest and ugliest conflicts, the Spanish-American War. 
</P>
<P>
The 1898 war was to protect American business interests in Cuba and allow the 
United States to expand its influence beyond its shores. Spain, then a dying 
colonial empire, was forced to hand over Guam, the Philippines and Puerto Rico 
after its defeat. The conflict was also a virtual circulation war, with press 
barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer purveying accounts of 
exaggerated or imagined Spanish cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Jones -- who has previously offered glimpses of the 
lives of Plains Indians, settlers in the American West, and Civil War 
combatants -- profiles more than half a dozen soldiers and civilians caught up 
in the Spanish-American conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The main character is Eben Pay, an Arkansas federal prosecutor who serves as a 
liaison-troubleshooter for the commanding general. Pay has a huge, fiercely 
loyal, Indian sidekick named Joe Mountain. Then there's Caroline Bessaford 
Newton, a young woman attached to the Red Cross and dallying with becoming 
attached to Eben Pay. 
</P>
<P>
The players include a Swedish-born foot soldier, a Welsh-born non-commissioned 
officer, Gen. John Shafter, and Capt. (at least initially) John Stoval. There 
are no real villains to hiss at. Incompetence and disease kill far more than 
the bullets from Spanish Mausers. As soon as peace breaks out, the Americans 
find themselves drinking with the Spanish opposition. By that time, 2,000 
Americans had been wounded in battle and about one-fifth of those had died. In 
addition, nearly 5,500 men died from malaria, dysentery, typhoid and yellow 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
During the first 100 pages, the author takes a great deal of time introducing 
all his characters. There's a cast of thousands, including Rough Rider Theodore 
Roosevelt and Red Cross founder Clara Barton. In the first third, while taking 
the reader back into the late 19th Century, it sometimes seems that the author 
will introduce everyone up to and including the mules lugging ammo boxes on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
But then the invasion begins. Like most assaults, it's not the smoothly oiled 
movement historians artfully portray: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Roosevelt and his men stole a locomotive. One regiment took the wagon 
train of another. Fistfights broke out. A terrified mule broke from its 
artillery harness and ran onto the front veranda of the Plant Hotel, squealing 
and kicking aside the wicker chairs . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A newspaperman recovering from the latest bout of conviviality was seen 
running down the sands toward the beach, nine miles away, waving a pencil in 
one hand, a magnum of champagne in the other, and shouting 'Wait! Wait!' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"An Army chaplain, left completely behind, not knowing how to get to the ships 
nor even where they were, fell to his knees on the kitchen loading dock and 
prayed. A number of Mr. Plant's Cuban employees joined him, many of them 
smoking marijuana cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the pace is slow, the wit in Jones' writing pulls the reader through. 
He gracefully glides between the carnage and black comedy of war, contrasting 
the horror of festering wounds with the bizarre antics of off-duty soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Young ladies dropped in each evening, wearing brightly flowered dresses cut 
low in the front. Some were not so young. Some were not ladies. Usually an old 
man came in and sat in one corner and played a 12-string guitar. Sometimes one 
of the ladies would sing as he played. These were always slow, sad songs. About 
love and death and the difficulty of getting rid of crab lice." 
</P>
<P>
"Remember Santiago" is a pleasurable mix of fact and fiction, a way to get a 
taste of "the good old days" and be thankful that they are gone.

RICHARD EDER: THE BOY LOST, THE WRITER FOUND; 
</P>
<P>
THIS BOY'S LIFE A MEMOIR BY TOBIAS WOLFF (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $18.95; 288 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The first thing in life is to assume a pose. What the second is, no one has 
yet discovered." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Wilde's remark is the epigraph to Tobias Wolff's memoir of growing up. On 
the surface, it is a suitable choice. Wolff masked and masqueraded his way 
through a childhood and adolescence that might otherwise have unhinged him. 
</P>
<P>
More deeply, though, it is the opposite of suitable; and far better. "This 
Boy's Life" does not consort with its Wildean epigram; it wrenches it apart. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff is the author of artful and highly crafted stories. The art in this 
memoir is its nakedness. It is stripped of pose; it has the courage to be a 
record, not of survival but of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we may know that Wolff is here, has married, teaches at Syracuse and 
has become a gifted and praised writer. But he lost himself before he ever 
found himself. This book is entirely about the loss, and not at all about any 
subsequent finding; save in the discipline and glitter of its pain. 
</P>
<P>
Tobias' mother took him along when she left his father and went to live with a 
lover in Florida. When he was 10, she left the lover, fearing of violence, and 
drove Tobias to Utah, where she intended to get rich speculating for uranium. 
The field was overcrowded, though, and she had to settle for an office job in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, the lover, joined them there. Things went along fairly peacefully -- 
though he would follow her jealously to work and burst into tears if he lost 
sight of her -- until he began pressing her to have a baby. She and Tobias took 
a cab to the bus station, planning to go to Phoenix, but a Seattle bus came 
through first, and they caught it. 
</P>
<P>
After a time in Seattle, they moved to Chinook, a town in the Cascade 
foothills, where Tobias' mother married Dwight, a house painter. Here Tobias 
lived, continually tormented by his stepfather, until, toward the end of high 
school, he got a scholarship to the Hill School, a boarding establishment in 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
The successive uprootings turned Tobias wary and elusive. But he had to cope 
with worse things. His real father remained in Connecticut with his older 
brother, Geoffrey. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wolff, a novelist and critic, wrote a first-rate and successful book 
about this unstable father. Tobias never heard from him during several critical 
years; it was only long after he died, in fact, that he realized how abandoned 
he had felt all along. 
</P>
<P>
The real hell of his young life, however, was provided by his stepfather. Roy, 
with his sporadic outbursts and instability, had been a kind of dress rehearsal 
for Dwight. Still, Roy showed a certain affection for the boy and had gave him 
a prized Winchester .22 rifle. Dwight, on the other hand, treated him as a 
perpetual interloper and rival. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bound to accept as my home a place I didn't feel at home in and to take 
as my father a man who was offended by my existence and would never stop 
questioning my right to it," Wolff writes. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his growing up, Tobias was a kind of hostage to this insecure, 
jealous and occasionally violent man. From the start, Dwight made it clear that 
he was determined to get the boy under his thumb. After a few drinks, the 
stepfather would take him for wildly careening rides in his car, while 
lecturing him for his laziness and rebelliousness. 
</P>
<P>
"Dwight made a study of me," Wolff writes. He compelled the boy to spend an 
entire winter of evenings painfully shelling horse-chestnuts; he made him work 
a paper route, took the money to "save" for him and spent it himself. He 
removed the cherished .22 rifle and traded it for an incontinent and gun-shy 
hunting dog that was ostensibly to belong to Tobias. 
</P>
<P>
It growled and snapped at him, though, until he eventually lost control and 
beat it with a mop handle. After that, it followed him everywhere -- much worse 
-- and insisted on sleeping in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight's oppression was accomplished less by violence than by a hectoring and 
mediocre discourse. What Tobias felt was not terror but hopelessness. "I 
experienced it as more bad weather to get through, not biting, just dim and 
heavy." When the boy sometimes dreamed of killing his stepfather, it was 
"mainly to shut him up." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait of Dwight is vivid and grisly, and the lighter touches only make 
it worse. When Tobias joins the Boy Scouts, Dwight, a former Eagle Scout, gets 
out his old badges, buys himself a spiffy new uniform and becomes an assistant 
scoutmaster. It's partly to keep an eye on Tobias, but mostly it's to outshine 
him. 
</P>
<P>
To brighten the house, Dwight paints it all white, even the furniture. He 
sprays the Christmas tree with three coats of white; the needles fall off. The 
piano, a black walnut Baldwin, bothers him. "Kind of stands out, doesn't it?" 
he says to the boy cheerfully; and paints it white, too; even the yellowed 
ivory keys. 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, who also stands out, conceals himself to protect his own needles. Even 
before meeting Dwight he has, at each move, tried to take on a new identity. 
Arriving in Seattle, where he changes his name to Jack, he falls in with a 
group of semi-delinquents and gets in trouble at school. He welcomes the move 
to Chinook as a chance to start over as a serious student and "a boy of 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
The Boy Scouts appealed to him because he could pretend to be the manly, 
energetic scout depicted in the manual. And when, at 16, he gets in touch with 
Geoffrey and his father, and they encourage him to try for a prep school 
scholarship, he constructs his most spectacular disguise. 
</P>
<P>
His grades had been mediocre at school; his record in general was totally 
undistinguished. Through a friend in the school office, he obtains a stack of 
blank transcripts and stationery. He gives himself top grades and writes a 
series of glowing recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
It works; with the encouragement of a local Hill alumnus, he is admitted. 
Predictably, he does badly there and eventually is expelled. When we last see 
him, he is about to join the Army and go to Vietnam -- one more new life. 
</P>
<P>
"This Boy's Life" is a desperate story. The desperation is conveyed in a 
narration that is chilly and dispassionate on the whole, vivid in its detail, 
and enlivened by disconcerting comedy. But Wolff does not use stoicism -- as it 
often is used -- as a mask of its own. He punctuates it with passionate 
outbursts and incidents of a near-surreal resonance. 
</P>
<P>
Reading his memoir can be like repeatedly closing one's hand around a drowning 
man's wrist, and feeling it repeatedly slip away. What bobs to the surface is 
the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Take his remarkable account of falsifying his school record. He invented 
things, he tells us, but only those things that he thought of as essentially 
authentic. He didn't write himself a football record; football didn't interest 
him. On the other hand, he could imagine himself a swimmer. So he invented a 
swimming team and a coach who praised his prowess in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote," this writer -- even then -- writes, "without heat or hyperbole, in 
the words my teachers would have used if they had known me as I knew myself. 
These were their letters. And on the boy who lived in their letters, the 
splendid phantom who carried all my hopes, it seems to me I saw, at last, my 
own face."

THE WAY OF COMMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must acknowledge that those portions of my book, "The Way of the Hunter," 
that Schuyler Ingle (Book Review, Dec. 4) did not find too tiresome a chore to 
read, he did seem begrudgingly to enjoy; and I do appreciate that. It is 
regrettable, though, that he found so much of the rest of it such "convoluted 
slogging." It's a shame that the proper use of grammar forced me to "scatter" 
all those commas through the text, as he so coyly put it, "like thousands of 
little kisses." It's a pity I was unable to convey complex ideas in as 
simplistic a fashion as he would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 It just might be, though, that there are other readers at large who would not 
find the task nearly so grueling. 
</P>
<P>
I would also like to note that the book, rather than the 180 pages in length 
that Ingle indicated, is with bibliography and index actually 223 pages long, 
and contains more than 60 photo illustrations.

REMEMBERING FAWN BRODIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding David Johnston's double review of "A Gathering of Saints" by Robert 
Lindsay and "The Mormon Murders" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith (Book 
Review, Dec. 18): Johnston states in his review that Robert Lindsay's book on 
the recent Mormon forgeries and murders "is easily the best single volume ever 
written to explain the church as it is, not as it wants to be seen." I have not 
read Lindsay's book, but I don't know whether it can "easily" claim this 
distinction over the book the reviewer omits mentioning, the remarkable 
biography of Joseph Smith, "No Man Knows My History," by the eminent historian 
Fawn M. Brodie, who taught for many years at UCLA and is now deceased. 
</P>
<P>
Originally published in 1945, Brodie's book is wonderfully written, a 
thoroughly compelling yet scholarly look at the man who founded the church, and 
its history. It's a marvelously understated, witty, yet compassionate study, 
which so upset church leaders that one of their members, Hugh Nibley, published 
a rebuttal entitled "No Ma'am That's Not History." It was virtually impossible 
to obtain a copy of Brodie's book in Utah when I was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth reading on a number of levels: as a record of the Utopian era in 
American development; as a history of Western conquest; as a study of the 
development of a uniquely American religion. Also, I agree with Brodie, who 
expressed surprise that no one has ever opted to regard The Book of Mormon as 
an example of early American frontier literature.

'YELLOWSTONE' THE NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disappointed in Michael J. Carroll's review (Book Review, Nov. 20) of my 
novel, "The Yellowstone." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll doesn't take care of the first piece of business of any review, to 
report to the reader the basic facts about the book. So here they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yellowstone": The first of a series called Rivers West, is a generational 
novel set in the Yellowstone country about the trader Mac Maclean and his 
family of Indian wives and half-breed children. In the first part, at the end 
of the fur trade era, Mac tries to establish a life for himself among the 
Cheyennes. A generation later, the family struggles to keep its native life way 
in the face of the Montana gold rush. The book has a bizarre cast, from 
idiosyncratic mountain men to a Scots lord to a Cheyenne male who lives his 
life as a female to a Jewish peddler, of all things, who traipses the Great 
Plains pulling a handcart full of sewing gear. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from underreporting, Carroll does some misreporting: He invents a rape 
that isn't there, and calls my book a frontier novel when it's set a thousand 
miles beyond the frontier. He also chastises me for my descriptions of the 
Yellowstone country. But those descriptions are from the point of view of the 
central character, Mac, so the language is not mine but his. 
</P>
<P>
I'll grant Carroll whatever opinion of my novel he likes, but not his critical 
ineptitude. If I'm going to get knocked, I want to get knocked by somebody 
good.

RACHEL AND HER CHILDREN Homeless Families in America by Jonathan Kozol (Fawcett 
Columbine: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
According to Jonathan Kozol, in New York City in 1986 there were reportedly 
28,000 homeless people in emergency shelters, with an estimated additional 
40,000 unsheltered citywide. Many of the families with whom Kozol spoke do not 
fit the expected stereotype: Many had been evicted from their homes for not 
meeting mortgage payments because of layoffs or bankruptcy from extensive 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no hope . . . nowhere to go," the Rachel of the title told Kozol. "Can 
you let the government know that we exist?" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the heart-rending personal testimony of families stationed in shelters 
or hotels, the book is an indictment of the government's neglect of the growing 
crisis, as it cut "virtually all funds to build or rehabilitate low-income 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting out of the housing business. Period," said a Housing and Urban 
Development deputy assistant secretary in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Kozol) is supremely lucky," Times reviewer Garry Abrams wrote, "the book 
will prove strong enough to become . . . what Michael Harrington's 'The Other 
America' was more than 20 years ago -- a call to conscience that stimulated new 
national policies and helped kick off a new era." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRATER VIOLET A Novel by Christopher Isherwood (Michael di Capua Books/ Farrar, 
Straus &amp; Giroux: $5.95) 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly autobiographical (Christopher Isherwood narrates, with 
characteristic amusement and charm), "Prater Violet" tells the story of a young 
British screenwriter's induction into the chaotic and often hilarious world of 
film making (specifically, adapting a musical, the title's "Prater Violet," 
into a full-length motion picture vehicle for a tempestuous Austrian director). 
</P>
<P>
Isherwood is the classic naif, all-seeing, eminently agreeable as he is pushed, 
pulled and alternately ignored as the film script he has composed lurches into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the movie will be a success; the director, the stars move on to 
other enterprises. Isherwood, fortunately for us, returns to prose fiction and 
memoir, and, when "Prater Violet" comes to a nearby theater, he cannot bring 
himself to see it. 
</P>
<P>
(Several of Isherwood's other works, including "My Guru and His Disciple," 
"Christopher and His Kind" and "The Memorial," have been reissued by Noonday / 
Michael di Capua / Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE STRANGE NATION OF RAFAEL MENDES by Moacyr Scliar (Ballantine Books: $4.95) 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Mendes awakens one morning in Sao Paolo dreading to hear reports 
exposing the near-failure of his finance company. 
</P>
<P>
What he discovers instead is a package delivered to him containing yellowing 
notebooks and clothes that belonged to his estranged father, now dead, which 
leads him to a genealogist and the revelation that his family is actually 
Jewish -- having become "New Christians" during the Spanish Inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, strange dreams begin, featuring the faces and histories of ancestors such 
as the biblical prophet Jonah, the Spanish physician Maimonides and a slew of 
Rafael Mendeses. 
</P>
<P>
"Reading 'The Strange Nation of Rafael Mendes' is like riding with a friend who 
drives recklessly," Mark R. Day wrote in these pages. "The novel lurches 
forward unexpectedly . . . dangerously skirting precipices separating the 
plausible from the absurd." It's frustrating at times, "but exhilarating and 
ultimately rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONTESSORI A Modern Approach by Paula Polk Lillard (Schocken Books: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
Education, as defined by turn-of-the-century educator Maria Montessori, means 
"a natural process spontaneously carried out by the human individual, and . . . 
acquired not by listening to words but by experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Paula Polk Lillard's "Montessori," first published in 1973, is particularly 
relevant today in view of many parents' ambitious and often counterproductive 
expectations for their children. The once-controversial Montessori philosophy 
appears far more reasonable: "It takes into account the child's instinct and 
legitimate need for purposeful activity," not permitting adults to exploit the 
child's talents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TELL ME A RIDDLE by Tillie Olsen (Delta / Seymour Lawrence: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
Tillie Olsen's excellence lies particularly in her ability to capture the modes 
of speech of characters of all ages. In this collection of short fiction, Olsen 
eloquently portrays the destitution and struggle of the Depression years in a 
mother's thoughts of her daughter's childhood ("She was a child seldom smiled 
at . . . a child of anxious, not proud, love"); the slurred speech of a sailor 
on shore leave ("Wha's it so quiet for? Hey, hit the tune box . . . wha time's 
it anyway?") or the words of 12-year-old Parrie about her favorite teacher 
("She's my most, wish I could get her but she only teaches 'celerated"). 
</P>
<P>
Most evocative of all is the title novella, the final bout between a couple 
married 47 years ("Vinegar he poured on me all his life; I am well marinated; 
how can I be honey now?"), which won the O. Henry Award in 1961.

LIGHT RAIL LINES MERIT ANOTHER SERIOUS LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is too soon to determine whether the old Red Car commuter rail line that was 
abandoned many years ago in favor of the automobile, and its attendant 
unwelcome traffic congestion, can ride to the rescue of Orange County 
residents. But the possibility is certainly worth studying. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, some rail lines, or at least their rights of way, are still in 
place. Some of those lines also are in public ownership. Perhaps most 
encouraging are recent indications that commuting by rail is gaining new 
acceptance among county residents. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, it was a terrible mistake to have abandoned the Red Car service. 
It would be even more inexcusable to now hastily sell off the last remaining 
rail rights of way and virtually eliminate the light rail option for good. 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove, city officials have been discussing plans to buy a stretch of 
rail right of way that runs through the city's redevelopment area and that is 
now owned by the Orange County Transit District. They wanted to buy 4 miles of 
the district's 7-mile right of way so that private developers could move ahead 
with proposed commercial and industrial projects. To their dismay, the County 
Transportation Comission has ordered a preliminary study to determine the 
feasibility of tying Santa Ana and Los Angeles together with a rail system that 
would include use of that right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials had been thinking about selling the right of way that 
runs from Raitt Street in Santa Ana to Beach Boulevard in Stanton because the 
future of light rail here seemed dim with the 1984 defeat of a proposed 1-cent 
sales-tax increase for transportation. But two major developments have now made 
it mandatory to determine the feasibility of rail routes connecting Orange and 
Los Angeles counties before pursuing any plans to sell off the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
A public opinion survey released by the Transportation Commission last fall 
disclosed a change in public attitudes that indicate a majority of residents 
would now be willing to support a half-cent increase in the local sales tax if 
they knew some of it would finance a new rail transit system. 
</P>
<P>
That potential for funding, coupled with the indication from the Southern 
Pacific Transportation Co. that it might be interested in selling the right of 
way on the northern stretch from Stanton into Los Angeles County, makes the 
feasibility of light rail service an option that must be explored. 
</P>
<P>
We can understand the Garden Grove City Council's frustration, but 
transportation officials (who maintain that their talks with Garden Grove were 
just that -- discussions, not formal negotiations) are obligated to give the 
possible rail routes the study that the new circumstances demand. 
</P>
<P>
If the rail lines can be developed, all of Orange County has a lot to gain. And 
it looks as if Garden Grove cannot really lose, no matter how the study turns 
out. If the rail line is found not to be feasible, Garden Grove could have a 
clear track to acquiring the right of way that would no longer be in the 
transit district's plans. If the line can be developed, it would enhance 
property values along its route, benefiting the city -- and all county 
residents -- in the process.

DEATH OF 2 IN CRASH WITH POLICE CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I followed with great concern the death of the two young women by the speeding 
Westminster police car. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that our police are killing innocent people under the 
mask of serving our communities. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James Cook's explanation that "the officer was responding to an 
emergency that allows police to travel at high speed with lights flashing and 
the siren on" is at best a whitewash of the reckless destruction of two young 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Being a father of two young women and two young boys, I felt a sincere hurt for 
the family of the two young women. I was so moved by the story I made a 
personal visit to the accident scene. As a former law enforcement officer, it 
was not difficult to reconstruct the accident. The skid marks seem to reveal 
that the police officer did not hit his brakes until after the impact. 
</P>
<P>
What we have in these tragic deaths is a classic example of the John Wayne 
syndrome in law enforcement of getting to the emergency at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
The Vehicle Code allows emergency vehicles to respond to emergencies in a 
manner exempting them from normal rules of the road, but it doesn't relieve the 
driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due 
regard for the safety of all persons and property. 
</P>
<P>
Police administrators and legislators must evaluate the cost of the seemingly 
reckless disregard for safety when operating an emergency vehicle Code 3. The 
goal of an emergency response is to get to the location where help is required. 
When we evaluate this accident, was the request for assistance and the arrest 
of a subject for child abuse and resisting arrest any justification for the 
senseless waste of two young women's lives?

DEATH OF 2 IN CRASH WITH POLICE CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Christmas Day tragedy in Westminster again brings up the criticism of 
high-speed response of emergency vehicles. Unfortunately, because of the 
legitimate legal ramifications, civil departments have to limit their 
descriptions of events, so almost all we hear are very one-sided stories. This 
is especially true for police departments where the popular view is to paint 
them as cruel, stupid, vicious monsters. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the driver who was killed with her companion clearly broke the 
law in not yielding to the police vehicle with its lights and siren. I am 
frequently aghast at the indifference of drivers to this simple rule, and I see 
people making left turns directly in front of oncoming ambulances or fire 
trucks. I also see drivers chattering away and not paying full attention to 
driving, or they have radios on at a very high volume. 
</P>
<P>
The Times on Dec. 28 carried a story about the widespread availability of 
assault rifles to the public. Little has been said about the nature of the 
individuals involved in the uproar to which police had been called, but I 
imagine any police officer wonders if he will be met by someone with such a 
weapon when going to a violent dispute. I think these days it would be critical 
to have help arrive quickly when a physical quarrel is in progress. It is too 
bad police don't have the ability to see into the future to tell whether or not 
every second counts. After something is over, the critics all come forward. Too 
bad they aren't the ones involved in facing these life-threatening situations.

SITUATION REGARDING TENURE AT UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article "Blacks, Women Charge UC Irvine With Prejudice" (Dec. 
18): 
</P>
<P>
As one of the relatively few minority graduate students at UC Irvine, it was 
disheartening for me to read about the experiences of the women and men who 
were denied tenure and other promotions at UCI. Apparently the University of 
California motto, "Let there be light," does not apply to UC Irvine's faculty 
promotion policies.

I had an experience I would like to share about a gentleman truck driver of a 
double rig. I was coming on Interstate 5 going north, in San Clemente at 
Avenida Palizada, trucks in the third and fourth lanes. This kind driver held 
back, turned on his lights to give me the go-ahead signal and granted me entry, 
courtesy of the road. 
</P>
<P>
I noted the big red "S" for Safeway and have written the president of this 
company. We hear and experience the rude truckers. Thank you kind driver. Wish 
there were more like you.

HAULING CONSCIENCE OUT OF THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Something has to be done to help the homeless." It's being talked and read 
about every day, yet whatever is done seems merely temporary. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: Some motels or hotels provide temporary shelter. Now on account 
of the recent cold spell, an armory will open its doors to house some of the 
needy. Food is being distributed. County social service agencies are trying to 
help solve the problem. Yet, as I see it all happening, it is temporary help. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen the sick, the helpless, the direly in need of care, I have a 
suggestion which will get rid of each city's problem. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase land in rural country to build a community for all these helpless 
people. Build barracks, a hospital and cultivate its land. Have its 
administration provide something to do for each able person there. Create a 
feeling that life is worthwhile and renew self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
It takes money. Funds from state and city and county. Then too, from churches. 
For instance; Have Dr. Schuller of Garden Grove Crystal Cathedral ask its 
Sunday congregation to donate $1 dollar to make this community possible. 
Millions of donated dollars from millions of churchgoers can make this plan 
come true.

PROCEEDING WITHOUT CAUTION WHEN IT RAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erroneous headlines and comments in reports of vehicle accidents follow every 
rainfall in Southern California -- and probably across the nation. The rains 
are blamed for causing the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but the direct causes of the accidents are the reckless drivers who fail 
to adjust their driving habits to the adverse conditions that are created by 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Observing some of these irresponsible drivers here for more than 20 years, I 
have seen them tailgate at the same distance when it rains, continue at the 
same high rates of speed, perform unsafe lane changes, harbor the same 
impatient attitudes, continue to drink and show little regard or respect for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
When headlines and comments blame the rains for the accidents, it lets the 
reckless drivers "off the hook," when in fact headlines should be directed 
towards these culprits and their insane way of operating a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One other negative result of improper blaming is that it negates some of the 
effort that is put forth by many people to try to cope with the unsafe drivers. 
This includes police agencies that are overwhelmed, those who promote safety 
through businesses, and public agencies such as the National Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
Having driven a car for more than 40 years -- and having been a safety 
consultant for more than 17 years in which driver safety has been an integral 
part of my occupational function -- it is quite apparent that attitudinal 
changes are a definite necessity for many of the drivers who daily thumb their 
noses at laws and other people through their killing habits. 
</P>
<P>
The next time it rains, perhaps you will advise those reporters and headline 
writers of their responsibilities in accurately stating the facts behind 
accidents instead of using the catch-all "rain blamed for accidents" phrasing. 
Driver irresponsibilities should be in the first paragraph for such stories.

TRASH FEE PROPOSAL DRAWS A PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All I am is a local homeowner who is fed up with taxes. The property tax and 
city tax on all utilities is enough. No new trash fee. Other cities around us 
are not taxed with both a trash fee on their water bill and a city tax on all 
their utilities, including water. 
</P>
<P>
The property tax, utility taxes and all other taxes, including this new trash 
pickup fee, all go into the city general fund. 
</P>
<P>
For years the general fund has paid the trash pickup costs, so why do we need 
this trash pickup fee? Perhaps it is to free this money that was formerly for 
trash pickup to now be used for some other purposes.

DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL FOR LAGUNA KNOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highest point in Laguna Beach is being planned to be bulldozed, permanently 
destroying the last remaining 360-degree vista where Lagunans can enjoy ocean 
and Saddleback Valley views. Of course, it is often said that you cannot stop 
"progress" and that a developer has the right to develop his private property. 
</P>
<P>
But this property is public property with the Laguna Beach Unified School 
District as its steward. The district is planning to sell its school site on 
Alta Laguna Boulevard and has devised a plan where, according to the 
environmental impact report, "every biological feature on the knoll will be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of environmental lessons should our children learn from the 
district's actions? Their plans calls for 270,000 cubic yards of grading, 
destroying the knoll; they certainly do not respect the land. The district is 
also a big promoter of the Laguna Laurel project with the building of 3,200 
houses in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Most Lagunans are concerned about protecting our quality of life and our open 
space, especially Laguna Canyon. Most Lagunans are concerned about excessive 
grading and the increasing traffic and congestion problems. I would like to see 
the school district remain independent but not at the cost of raping the 
environment and developing Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
We all must work to preserve Laguna Canyon, save the knoll, and stop the 
district from promoting excessive grading and increased development. Our 
children deserve better lessons.

ONE WORKER FOUND FOR ALL THOSE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend was kind enough to share with me your Orange County employment story 
in the Christmas edition of the Times ("Job Openings in Orange County Exceed 
Workers," Dec. 26). I am somewhat mystified by the allegation of employers that 
they can't find workers. 
</P>
<P>
I have been unemployed since August, except for a brief stint as a "gofer" for 
a school portrait studio . . . at less than living wages. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you will remember me as Suburban Editor of the old Daily News Tribune. 
Since I was let go there ("economic staff reductions"), I was news editor of 
the Anaheim Bulletin for 6 years, but was let go on an hour's notice there, 
with a number of weak reasons, including economics. I then worked in a PR 
agency for a year before it too was hit by an economic crunch. For about 5 
years I worked for the Boy Scouts of America in Los Angeles (PR, photos, 
camping services), until I was suddenly fired early in August. Since that time, 
the hungry-for-employees firms here in Orange County, and elsewhere, have 
either ignored my applications for work, or have responded that I am 
"over-qualified" or "not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Where are all these Orange County employers (the Employment Development 
Department has only jobs listed for minimum or near-minimum wages that won't 
pay enough to cover even the cost of my very low mortgage payments)? 
</P>
<P>
I have sought jobs outside of journalism, but was told that I wasn't even 
qualified to be a $1,500-per-month school janitor.

PLANNERS SEEK SOLUTION TO SUBURBAN GRIDLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY AMONG THOSE WANTING CONGRESS TO TARGET LOCAL NEEDS OVER 
INTERSTATE PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the postwar American Dream. When Congress approved the Interstate 
Highway System in 1944, it paved the way for about 44,000 miles of new roads 
that would link cities from coast to coast and whisk commuters from suburban 
homes to downtown jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Now the interstate system is virtually complete, a monument to America's love 
affair with the automobile. But in the nation's rapidly growing suburbs, 
drivers face more woes than ever. From Orange County to Long Island, millions 
of motorists are caught up in massive traffic jams, fighting their way through 
streets that were never designed to handle so many cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stop-and-Go Commute 
</P>
<P>
For a growing number of Americans, the drive from their home to a nearby 
shopping center has come to rival the ordeal of a stop-and-go commute to work. 
Unforeseen 40 years ago, suburban congestion has become the fastest-growing 
traffic problem in America today. 
</P>
<P>
But it is only recently that Washington has begun to take notice. Federal 
highway programs have been primarily designed to build freeways, leaving state 
and county governments to resolve congestion on local streets. This year, 
however, Congress will start drafting a new blueprint for the nation's 
$14-billion federal highway program, and experts predict that metropolitan 
gridlock will at last be a prime target. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we're facing problems in the suburbs that were not envisioned years 
ago," said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), the chairman of the House 
Public Works and Transportation Committee. "As we decide the future of the 
highway program, we have to be aware of the need for solutions. . . . The 
economic health of the nation depends on it." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot of people are expecting that there will be a great deal 
more money from the federal government," said Monte Ward, government affairs 
director for the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But if local 
governments had a freer hand in spending these funds, it could make a real 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, where traffic congestion has become a way of life, is a case in 
point. Local officials are committed to freeway improvements but they are also 
eager to use federal funds more creatively on other efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the county is moving forward with plans, using federal funds, for 
three toll roads that would give motorists an alternative to traffic-choked 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, county officials are considering opening commuter rail service on 
the existing Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail corridor. Under the plan, commuters 
could ride from Irvine to downtown Los Angeles or from San Juan Capistrano to 
downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, however, would require a more flexible use of federal money, 
diverting highway funds to improve stations and acquire rail cars, Ward said. 
Under the present federal program, he noted, mass transit funds "are geared 
toward traditional patterns in the East, where suburban areas surround the big 
city." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, where suburbs have grown without a definable city 
center, "we don't compete well for those funds," he said. "It's another reason 
why there should be more freedom to move funds around." 
</P>

Finally, a more flexible federal program could allow the county to spend more 
on streamlining the traffic flow on key arterial streets such as Beach and 
Katella boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, federal highway programs don't allocate much money to such 
projects, but if they did, you could make these kinds of decisions," Ward said. 
"You could decide that it might be more important to synchronize traffic 
signals on Beach Boulevard than to spend all of your money on freeways." 
</P>
<P>
Without these improvements, experts believe traffic congestion in Orange County 
and other suburban areas will worsen. Eventually, local, state and federal 
officials will have to work together on ways to link housing growth with 
transportation and plan future development throughout these regions, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of suburban streets to handle the growing number of cars has caused 
heavy traffic jams on the nation's interstates, as many motorists now use 
freeways to travel 2 to 3 miles as part of their daily commute. That, in turn, 
has made it difficult for millions of trucks across the nation to maintain 
on-time deliveries for their cargoes, causing delays and economic problems for 
a multitude of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, this local problem becomes a barrier to interstate commerce," said 
Robert Farris, director of the Federal Highway Administration. "All of these 
transportation issues are interrelated, and we've got to start looking at them 
simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings This Year 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, Anderson's panel will hold hearings on myriad transportation 
problems this year, including suburban congestion, crumbling bridges, crowded 
interstates, mass transit needs and the environmental consequences of building 
more highways. If all goes as planned, Congress will approve a new Surface 
Transportation Act in 1991, the first of the "post interstate" era. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is important because a broad coalition of transportation 
experts and state and local officials is urging Congress to shift its attention 
away from freeway projects. In particular, they want federal funds now 
earmarked for highway work to be distributed with fewer strings attached so 
cities and suburbs can have greater flexibility in devising ways to relieve 
their jammed streets. 
</P>
<P>
Few of them doubt the importance of maintaining and upgrading the interstate 
system, which represents a multibillion-dollar investment, but they argue that 
other needs are equally important. 
</P>
<P>
On the local level, this could mean more projects to widen suburban boulevards, 
synchronize traffic lights, launch light-rail systems and experiment with 
van-pooling programs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, planners say, it could speed up completion of the toll-road 
projects in Orange County and efforts to reduce congestion on Victory Boulevard 
in the San Fernando Valley. Programs to reduce the number of trucks on the Long 
Beach and San Diego freeways could also benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are past the point in this country where we can just keep building freeways 
to reduce congestion," said Jim Beall, a San Jose city councilman and member of 
the Transportation 2020 task force, a national study group created by 
transportation officials to find new solutions for traffic problems. "We 
shouldn't have to spend money on freeways just because that's the only way 
Washington says the money can be spent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flexibility Needed 
</P>
<P>
In drawing up the new plan, many experts say, it is crucial that Washington 
avoid trying to devise one cure for suburban congestion, because its forms and 
causes differ substantially from one community to the next across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no magic bill that Congress can pass into law that will solve this 
problem," said Francis B. Francois, executive director of the Assn. of State 
Highway and Transportation Officials. "If there are 50 different metropolitan 
areas with the problem, then 50 different answers are needed. What works in Los 
Angeles won't work in Boston, and that's why there needs to be more flexibility 
in the system." 
</P>
<P>
But getting Congress to agree to such sweeping changes may not be easy, given 
the conflicting needs of urban and rural communities, said one House 
transportation aide. States such as Idaho and Montana are heavily dependent on 
federal funds for their roads, and they might oppose a new division of funds 
that focuses more on metropolitan problems. 
</P>
<P>
It may be even more difficult to increase federal spending on road programs, as 
members of Transportation 2020 and some in Congress have urged. The blue-ribbon 
group has suggested that annual spending by all levels of government on highway 
projects, now about $63 billion, eventually be increased to $100 billion, to 
maintain bridges and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
That may be unlikely, however, given the federal government's reluctance to 
spend all the money now being raised for highways. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1956, the sole source of funds for the program has been the federal 
gasoline tax, which goes into a special account called the Highway Trust Fund. 
In recent years, Congress has withheld spending about 10% of the money flowing 
into the trust fund to help offset the nation's $155-billion budget deficit. 
Currently, while $14 billion is distributed annually for highways, there is an 
unused surplus of about $13.6 billion in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Several Votes 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and others would like to see that money freed up for transportation 
projects, including about $1 billion for work in California. But they have lost 
several House votes to exempt the highway funds from budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential barrier to increased transportation spending is a proposed 
increase in the federal gasoline tax, now being discussed by members of 
Congress as a deficit-fighting measure. Highway advocates fear that such an 
increase in the 9 cents per gallon federal tax would discourage many states 
from raising their own gasoline taxes and thus retard the growth of locally 
sponsored transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, transportation officials are watching these battles closely. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be monitoring Congress carefully, to see how they change the 
highway program," said Robert Best, director of Caltrans, the state's 
transportation agency. "What happens in Washington matters very much to us 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Few dispute the need for change. Federal, state and local officials agree that 
the current highway program is geared to a bygone era of sleepy bedroom suburbs 
and commuters heading for distant, downtown jobs. In the past 30 years, there 
has been an explosive growth in the size and economic importance of American 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
From 1960 to 1980, the number of jobs located in the suburbs grew from 14 
million to 33 million. More than 25 million commuters drive every day from a 
suburban home to a suburban job, or 38% of all trips. Not surprisingly, the 
suburb-to-suburb commute has become the nation's most prevalent route of daily 
transportation, according to a demographic study by the Eno Foundation for 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, state and local officials are demanding that the federal highway 
program keep pace with this shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the public is concerned about congestion, even though they haven't yet 
pegged it as a national issue," said Ray Barnhart, former head of the Federal 
Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we don't take intelligent steps now, we're going to be looking at a 50% 
increase in Los Angeles traffic over the next 30 years. If we do nothing to 
expand the capacity down there, you might as well shut the community down."

GOVERNOR PROPOSES STIFFER PENALTIES FOR DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Worried that tough laws in other states are encouraging drug dealers to move 
their operations to California, Gov. George Deukmejian called Saturday for even 
stronger penalties here to combat drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In a preview of his upcoming State of the State Address, Deukmejian proposed 
sharply increasing prison sentences for large-scale drug pushers and the death 
penalty for drug dealers who commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I want California to be first in the nation in many fields, but I don't want 
our state to be the No. 1 center of illegal drug trafficking," the governor 
said in his weekly radio broadcast. "We must act quickly to make our anti-drug 
laws the toughest in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Deukmejian gave only a brief outline of his proposal. Donna 
Lucas, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the plan would be fleshed out when 
legislation is drafted and introduced in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the governor called for imposing a minimum penalty of 25 years 
without possibility of parole on "large-scale importers of heroin and cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, selling a large amount of cocaine or heroin in California could 
result in a penalty as short as three years in prison, Deukmejian said. In 
Florida, such a crime would be punished by a minimum of 15 years in prison, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Deukmejian's proposal, a 25-year prison sentence would be imposed on 
convicted drug dealers who seek to sell more than 400 grams of cocaine in 
California, Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governor said he would seek to authorize the death penalty 
"for certain murders committed by large-scale drug pushers." A long-time 
advocate of capital punishment, Deukmejian did not elaborate on what 
circumstances would warrant the death penalty in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas said the governor's death penalty legislation would duplicate a federal 
law enacted last year. Adopting a similar state law, she said, would make it 
easier for prosecutors to win death sentences in California drug-related murder 
cases.

FAMILY, FRIENDS MOURN GIRL STRUCK IN CROSSWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As mourners entered Community Reformed Church in Buena Park on Saturday to 
remember 6-year-old Mary Dargan, who died after a car hit her in a crosswalk, a 
neighbor and family friend said the death could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a traffic light there," said Chet Polston, 67, about the Buena Park 
intersection marked by a yellow crosswalk and stop signs. "We've got to get 
that thing taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Mary, a first-grader at San Marino Elementary School, was walking home from 
school holding hands with her grandmother and younger sister Tuesday when a car 
hit all three in the crosswalk on Crescent Avenue at San Marino Drive. Mary 
died of her injuries Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Dargan, 72, remains in satisfactory condition with a broken pelvis and 
cuts at Los Alamitos Medical Center. Morgan Dargan, 5, who is in kindergarten, 
is in stable condition at Charter Community Hospital in Hawaiian Gardens with a 
fractured thigh bone. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad part about it is (Morgan) keeps asking for her sister," Polston said. 
"It's a shame, a total shame." 
</P>
<P>
The driver, 25-year-old Deborah Casey of La Palma, has been charged with 
misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. If convicted, she could receive up to a 
year in County Jail or a fine, a spokesman for the district attorney's office 
said. Casey's mother, Jeanette, has said her daughter was hysterical after the 
accident and on sedatives. 
</P>
<P>
But Polston said he doesn't blame Casey for the accident. "People have been 
trying to get a stoplight there for 20 years," he said. "If I was going to be a 
crosswalk guard, I'd be scared to work there." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained Tuesday that the intersection across the street from San 
Marino school has been the scene of several accidents. Studies in several 
Orange County cities have shown that pedestrians are more likely to be hit at a 
marked crosswalk than at an unmarked crossing because they feel a false sense 
of security. 
</P>
<P>
Polston said Rose Dargan walked her granddaughter home from school almost every 
day. They lived about half a block from the accident site. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 friends and family members attended the funeral. A portrait of 
Mary sat amid white carnations and pink roses on top of her small, white 
casket. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Duane Tellinghuisen asked the audience to look at the picture and keep 
Mary in their memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that what life consists of, memories?" he said. "Aren't those the things 
we really cherish? 
</P>
<P>
"We can ask, 'Why, God?' But there's no answer. Friends, don't wait around for 
the answer." 
</P>
<P>
After the burial at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress, Mary's friends and 
classmates placed flowers at the scene of the accident as a memorial.

SANTA ANA'S FIESTA MARKETPLACE REPRESENTS COLORFUL EXPERIMENT IN REVIVING 
DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the gleaming, new MainPlace mall opened in Santa Ana in 1987, replete with 
computer boutiques, trendy toy shops and richly stocked department stores, 
officials hailed it as the most important development in the city in years. 
</P>
<P>
In dollars, that may be true. 
</P>
<P>
But 2 miles away, where blood banks, beer bars and flophouses once flourished, 
a smaller, different kind of mall has quietly emerged that may do far more to 
preserve the soul of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
It is the strikingly colorful Fiesta Marketplace, an open-air collection of 
Latino-oriented stores, theaters and restaurants that city officials hope will 
pump new blood into the heart of Santa Ana's old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Stores Open Already 
</P>
<P>
The $12-million project, which encompasses four square blocks, should be 
completed sometime this spring, but about half the 25 stores and restaurants 
that will fill the marketplace are already operating. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a spiritual quality to a successful downtown," said City Councilman 
Daniel E. Griset, who was instrumental in getting the project off the ground. 
"It's hard to put a price tag on what a working downtown does for an entire 
city. It was apparent to me that if we had let the downtown fail, it would have 
been a cancer eating away at ever-widening circles" of the city. 
</P>
<P>
While MainPlace attracts the well-heeled shopper, Fiesta Marketplace offers 
less-expensive merchandise and targets immigrants who already shop downtown, as 
well as assimilated Latinos who would shop there if they were given an 
appealing environment. About half of Santa Ana's 250,000 residents are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eclectic Mix of Structures 
</P>
<P>
With that goal in mind, five businessmen who make up the Fiesta Marketplace 
partnership have carved out a project unique in Orange County both in 
appearance and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Pastel-colored, neo-Spanish-style buildings with neon trim stand alongside 
renovated turn-of-the-century landmark structures. A quaint carrousel sits in 
the middle of the now pedestrian-only Spurgeon Street at 4th Street, while a 
96-foot-long neon sign spans the marketplace entrance a block up Spurgeon at 
5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
A twin-screen movie theater dominates one block of the marketplace along 4th 
Street. Around the corner on Spurgeon, smells from a bakery and a pizzeria waft 
toward the historic Yost Theater, which is undergoing restoration and will once 
again host live comedy and music acts, as it did in its vaudeville heyday. 
</P>
<P>
The project still lacks the finishing touches, and several prominent 
storefronts remain vacant. But it is eye-catching even in its unfinished state. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to delineate a separate area that was downtown . . . a place these 
people (could) call their own, where they wouldn't feel alienated walking 
through the marble pillars of South Coast Plaza," said project developer Irving 
M. Chase. "We wanted it to be like Disneyland . . . where a psychological 
change takes place the minute they enter." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its color scheme and clientele, there is another, less apparent 
quality to Fiesta Marketplace that distinguishes it from other redevelopment 
projects, which sometimes force local merchants and property owners out to make 
room for out-of-town developers and chain stores. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some merchants were displaced by Fiesta Marketplace. But the 
developers, in this case, include Latino property owners and shopkeepers who 
have made a living along 4th Street for decades: 
</P>
<P>
* Raymond Rangel, born and raised in Santa Ana's tough Delhi neighborhood. 
Rangel opened his clothing store on 4th Street in 1955 with a $600 investment 
and a meager inventory of a few suits and shirts. Today, he owns his own 
building and his shop is filled with Western wear -- including $350 Stetson 
hats made of 100% beaver hair. 
</P>
<P>
* Jose Ceballos, an immigrant from Mexico who opened his first discoteca y 
libreria (record and book shop) on 4th Street 12 years ago. His seven DIMEX 
stores -- two of which are in the Fiesta Marketplace -- now carry an 
incongruous assortment of goods, including "boom boxes," jeans, irons, blenders 
and telephones, as well as what got him started, musical cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert D. Escalante, the owner of Custom Auto Service at 3rd and French 
streets. The business specializes in rebuilding and selling vintage Packard 
automobiles to customers around the world and has been in its present location 
for more than 20 years. Escalante, a Santa Ana High School graduate, began 
working in the shop at the age of 17 and took over the business 5 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* Allan Fainbarg, a developer who came to Santa Ana as an infant in 1920, the 
same year that his father, Nathan, a Russian immigrant, bought the Eureka Shoe 
Store on 4th Street. Young Allan opened his first business in Santa Ana at the 
age of 13 -- a gas station at 2nd and Bush streets -- and acquired several 
properties downtown over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth partner, Irv Chase, does not have Santa Ana roots, but he happens to 
be Fainbarg's son-in-law. While Fainbarg has provided most of the money, Chase 
has provided most of the energy and expertise, spending virtually all of his 
time for the past 4 years on an unorthodox, unusually complicated project that 
he says will either "make history" or make him and his partners "the 
laughingstock of the Orange County development community." 
</P>
<P>
City officials now proudly point to the local involvement in Fiesta Marketplace 
as evidence of their progressive redevelopment policy. And the project has won 
national awards for its design and innovative mix of public and private 
investment. But it almost happened differently. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1984, and Santa Ana City Manager Robert C. Bobb was leading an 
aggressive, highly publicized and heatedly debated redevelopment effort that he 
hoped would make Santa Ana the focal point of the county. His plans for the 
city included a 32-story skyscraper that would have been the tallest building 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, the city sent out about 200 requests for proposals to developers, 
asking them to submit plans for a "festival shopping" center to be built on 
what is now the Fiesta Marketplace site. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty popular idea nationwide" at the time, said Ed Henning, a 
private consultant who was then project manager for the city. Cities like 
Baltimore, Boston and Seattle were building centers to revitalize their 
waterfronts, and Santa Ana hoped to do the same to its downtown. The city's 
original concept did not include an ethnic element, Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante, Rangel and other downtown businessmen whose properties were to be 
gobbled up for the new development began meeting, sometimes in the old Packard 
shop, sometimes in Jess Galvan's notorious Chico Club or El Latino bars. They 
came up with a novel idea: They would form a partnership and do the project 
themselves, allowing any property owner in the project site to hold onto his 
building and participate. 
</P>
<P>
"I started there, on that property," Ceballos said of his first DIMEX store. 
"We feed ourselves from it. . . . We felt it wasn't fair for the city to get us 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The businessmen then tried to persuade the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get them to understand not what the city was doing was wrong, but 
that there were businessmen here who could do it," Escalante said. 
</P>
<P>
Their first ally was then-Vice Mayor Griset, who was up for reelection that 
fall and was hearing talk that the downtown merchants believed that the city 
wasn't giving them a fair shake. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a lot of time with the downtown businessmen," said Griset, who won 
reelection again last fall. "I learned that there were a number of people with 
established roots downtown, who had earned the right . . . to attack the blight 
on East 4th Street." 
</P>
<P>
At a July 6 meeting in Escalante's Packard shop, Griset, Bobb and the downtown 
businessmen reached an agreement: Griset would work to halt the process of 
recruiting a developer, while the merchants would come up with a plan to 
present to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the City Council agreed to give the merchants a chance. They now 
had political backing and at least a rough vision of what they wanted. But they 
lacked money; no banker in his right mind would finance the construction of a 
multimillion-dollar project in a risky part of town -- especially when the 
developers were a group of shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Allan Fainbarg. A successful developer and businessman -- he sold his 
chain of 25 Wild West Stores to General Mills in 1981 -- Fainbarg had lost 
other properties in Santa Ana to eminent domain, and now a building owned by a 
family trust stood in the path of another project. He also knew the other 4th 
Street businessmen and understood their unwillingness to be uprooted. He was 
in, and the Fiesta Marketplace partnership was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made my living in Santa Ana," said Fainbarg, 69, who now lives in Newport 
Beach. "I wanted to preserve the old buildings and give the local people a 
chance to preserve their businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Fainbarg's financial commitment to the project enabled the partners to obtain 
$6 million in bond financing from the Bank of America and about $680,000 in 
federal funds slated for urban development. All property owners in the project 
area were given the option of holding on to their buildings and buying into the 
partnership. Those who chose to leave sold their buildings to the city, which 
in turn sold them below market value to the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Ceballos, Rangel and Escalante stayed, as did barber Bob Benitez, 
who has been on 4th Street since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of blazing new trails there," said former project manager 
Henning, referring to the unorthodox ownership arrangement. "There were a lot 
of reasons not to pursue it -- it was very expensive, very difficult and very 
time-consuming. Financially, it may not have made the most sense, but 
politically, it made sense and still does." 
</P>
<P>
Chase, who was asked to come in on the project by his father-in-law, says the 
success or failure of Fiesta Marketplace will depend on its ability to attract 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be the most difficult task . . . getting more women down there," 
Chase said. The area has long been a thriving center of commerce, but the 
clientele for the most part has consisted of single male immigrants who found 
in the downtown a little bit of the Mexico they had left. "That customer is 
still there," Chase said, "but we have to expand on that. . . . If we can't 
achieve that . . . in my mind, that would be a failure." 
</P>
<P>
Chase hopes the movie theater, carrousel and two Mexican restaurants that have 
leased space will help draw families to the marketplace -- as will the dress 
shops and stores like Anna's Linens, the newest in a chain of 13 stores. The 
Fiesta Marketplace Anna's is the only one that is not in a strip center. 
</P>
<P>
"We're after the old Zody's customer," said Jonathan A. Weston, chief financial 
officer for the chain, referring to the now-closed string of department stores. 
"We think we've found our niche. . . . This (Santa Ana) fits our demographics." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking along a similar line was Hugo Bandi, a Los Angeles-based soccer 
promoter who was growing tired of the daily commute from his Fountain Valley 
home. So he opened a sporting goods shop in Fiesta Marketplace with a partner, 
Pedro Prieto, who already has two stores in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The store specializes in sports that have heavy Latino participation, such as 
soccer, boxing and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I was looking around here for 8 years, but I never found anything 
until Fiesta Marketplace came along," said Bandi, a naturalized citizen born in 
Argentina. He is new to retailing, but he already has an eye for promotions: a 
25-inch television set sits in the window, and Bandi plays videotapes of big 
soccer and boxing matches. 
</P>
<P>
On one recent rainy afternoon, about 20 men stood huddled in front of Casa 
Prieto, watching Sugar Ray Leonard battle Marvin Hagler in their historic 1987 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer to the area is baker Rene Moya, who opened the Moya family's 
third bakery in Southern California -- and first in Orange County -- about a 
month ago.

"We felt the place holds a lot of promise," said the Cuban-born Moya, chopping 
walnuts to spread over a fresh batch of brownies. He and his wife, Jacki, 
specialize in pastries and cakes, rather than the breads usually found in 
traditional Mexican bakeries. "There's the proximity to downtown, a lot of 
parking and a large Hispanic population. . . . And there are other things you 
get -- the carrousel, a live band (on weekends) and a security guard." 
</P>
<P>
Business has been slow for the new stores that have already opened. But the 
owners said they were confident that once Fiesta Marketplace fills up -- which 
the developers hope will happen in the next few months -- business will take 
off. 
</P>
<P>
The established businesses that chose to stay in the project have hardly missed 
a beat. Raymond Rangel said that the day before Christmas was his biggest sales 
day ever, totaling about $7,800. Ceballos' two DIMEX stores bustle with 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any doubt in my mind that it will be a success," Ceballos said. 
"Whoever doesn't want to believe it, that's their problem. I'm going to make 
money on it."

CHLORINE FUMES AT SWIM MEET INJURE 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two children were hospitalized and 10 other people were treated for inhalation 
of chlorine fumes after a pipe burst during a swim meet Saturday at El Toro 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
The unseen but smelly chlorine fumes sent the 450 swimmers and about 1,000 
spectators into the parking lot while police and county firefighters sealed off 
the area, rerouting traffic away from Serrano Road. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Urban, 8, of Mission Viejo and an unidentified child were treated at 
Saddleback Community Hospital and released. The children complained of chest 
pains, upset stomach and itchy eyes, said County Fire Department Battalion 
Chief Jerold Hunter, who directed the response team. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Blacketer, 37, of Anaheim, who had been beside the pool timing her 
16-year-old son Brian's race when the leak occurred, said she smelled chlorine 
and then coughed and "felt sick to my stomach. My eyes were burning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evacuation Went Smoothly 
</P>
<P>
Merritt Julson, 45, of El Toro, a swim meet coordinator, said the evacuation 
was done "very smoothly, with no panic." 
</P>
<P>
"These people are swim people and they understand chlorine; you don't screw 
around with chlorine," Julson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brill, 20, a pool maintenance employee, said he had noticed water flowing 
under the door of the chlorine room. When he opened the door, he said, he saw 
"a big leak" in a chlorine pipe. He was unable to contain the leak before 
firefighters arrived and shut off the flow. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe contains a highly concentrated mixture of chlorine and water that is 
automatically monitored and fed to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Another swim meet official, Stan Reaves, 41, of El Toro, said he was carrying 
his 7-year-old daughter, who had just competed in the meet, toward the corner 
of the pool where the chlorine system is stored when "we got nailed" by a heavy 
whiff of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody picked up on it real fast and moved on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Announcers for the meet used the public address system to order an evacuation, 
which already had begun. Meet secretaries dialed 911 and the County Fire 
Department dispatched a hazardous-waste unit, two fire engines and a paramedic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the injuries seemed serious," Hunter said. "In 15 or 20 minutes, it 
(chlorine) should get out of their systems." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro High School Principal Don Martin, who was in his office at the other 
end of the campus when the pipe burst, said: "We just shut down the tank. 
There's no danger now at all." 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers and spectators streamed back into the pool area and, in just over an 
hour, the invitational swim meet, sponsored by Saddleback Valley Aquatics, was 
reopened.

NATURE-SEEKING SCOUTS STUMBLE ACROSS COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the boys of Cub Scout Pack 333 set out on a nature hike in Newport Beach 
on Saturday, they had no idea the trail would lead to a good deed. 
</P>
<P>
The Scouts, led by Newport Beach lawyer Alan W. Courtney, were meandering 
through the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve when they discovered a small 
suitcase. It contained more than a pound and a half of cocaine with a street 
value estimated by police at $30,000, they later learned. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the Back Bay and we were looking at plants and the animals," said 
Courtney, Cub master for the Scouts, who attend Anderson Elementary School. "We 
were walking along and we saw this suitcase stuffed underneath some bushes. It 
was like carry-on luggage." 
</P>
<P>
The two boys who found the suitcase -- Courtney's son Ben, 9, and Casey 
Luchesi, 8 -- took it to Courtney, who cut the zipper open with a pocketknife. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a paper sack, and inside that was a pound and a half of cocaine in 
small packets. There also was a cigar box that had cocaine packets in it, and 
then there was a small testing kit in a pink plastic container." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the way it was packaged, Courtney immediately suspected it was 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it didn't look like Sweet 'N Low," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked it up and brought it immediately to the Newport Beach Police 
Department," he added. "They thanked us and gave all the kids badges. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids knew what it was. They have a real strong anti-drug program at 
Anderson. They were real glad to find it and turn it over to the police."

WINDS LIKELY TO SEND SHOWERS AND COLD AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

There were no reports of snow in Orange County Saturday but winter made its 
presence felt in other ways, drawing the homeless to special shelters, causing 
homeowners to scramble to cover gardens and fruit growers to protect crops. 
</P>
<P>
The snow level was expected to drop to 2,000 feet overnight as a weak weather 
disturbance moved through Southern California, bringing a second night of rain 
-- and possibly snow showers in some areas -- and freezing temperatures to 
wind-sheltered valleys. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for WeatherData Inc., the private weather service that provides 
forecasts for The Times, said the showers and cold should move out of the area 
today as the skies clear and winds increase. Gusts near the canyons could reach 
25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freezing Temperatures 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Saturday night in valleys sheltered from the winds were expected 
to drop into the high 20s or low 30s, meaning fruit crops in those areas faced 
frost dangers. Areas of calm winds record lower temperatures than those with 
stiffer breezes. 
</P>
<P>
The low temperature in San Juan Capistrano reached 25 degrees Saturday morning, 
while San Clemente recorded a low of 28, Santa Ana a low of 33 and El Toro a 
low of 32. 
</P>
<P>
Snowflakes were sighted in a number of Los Angeles County communities Saturday 
morning, including Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys. However, they disappeared as they 
touched the ground. No snow was recorded in downtown Los Angeles, which saw its 
last flurries in 1949. The low temperature early Saturday at the Los Angeles 
Civic Center was 35 degrees, the coldest morning so far this winter. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless flocked to special shelters in Santa Ana, Fullerton and Mission 
Viejo to escape the freezing temperatures and find a warm meal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Churches Shelter Homeless 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 homeless spent the night at the First Presbyterian Church in 
Santa Ana, while about 60 packed the First Presbyterian Church of Fullerton. 
Shelter for about 50 people was also provided at the Shepherd of the Hill 
United Methodist Church in Mission Viejo, said Susan Oakson of the Orange 
County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The churches offered their facilities as shelters because the National Guard 
armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton that are normally used were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful and thankful to these communities who have offered to 
help. They have just been wonderful in rising to the cause," Oakson said. "The 
county provided us with blankets and towels from the armories and we got cots 
from the Red Cross. We are really pleased with the cooperation and partnerships 
we have been able to forge." 
</P>
<P>
Homeless shelters were opened throughout the weekend at the Downey, Central, 
Elysian Park and Elysian Valley recreation centers. Shelter also was available 
at the National Guard armories in Van Nuys and West Los Angeles. There was no 
estimate of how many homeless sought temporary housing.

STUDY WARNS OF TOXIC CHEMICAL OFF THE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A highly toxic chemical used to keep barnacles off boats was found in 
"alarmingly high" levels in mussels along the coasts of Orange, Los Angeles, 
San Diego and Contra Costa counties before it was banned for use on most boats 
last year, according to a state draft report. 
</P>
<P>
Testing for tributyltin -- a chemical used in paints to keep algae as well as 
barnacles off boat hulls -- began in 1986 as part of a larger annual study by 
the state's Mussel Watch, a program that uses mussels to test water quality in 
bays and along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
A second round of samples taken by Mussel Watch in late 1986 and early 1987 -- 
the latest period for which data is available -- showed "dramatic" increases of 
the compound in mussel tissue, according to the report, due for release next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986-87, alarmingly high traces of TBT in transplanted mussels were found 
at Richmond Inner Harbor, Monterey Bay, Port Hueneme, Marina del Rey, Los 
Angeles, Newport Bay and San Diego sites," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in the level of TBT included 219% at the Richmond Inner Harbor in 
Contra Costa County, 121% at the Newport Bay Upper Rhine Channel, 112% at the 
Consolidated Slip in Los Angeles and 96% at the North Harbor Drive commercial 
basin in San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
One TBT expert termed the Mussel Watch figures "interesting" but said the lag 
time in the samples fails to show the effects of a 1988 state ban of the 
compound for sport and pleasure boats, the major users of TBT-laced paints. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we have regulations on the books in California that should 
ameliorate the problem, and it's going to take a number of years -- at least 5 
or 10 years -- to see if it works," said Edward D. Goldberg of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The state banned the use of TBT paints on boats with hulls measuring 81 feet or 
less; exempted are larger boats and those with aluminum hulls.

STOCK WATCH: FIRM RAISES $2.5 MILLION IN FIRST PUBLIC STOCK SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's newest public company is OptimumCare Corp. of Laguna Niguel, a 
provider of psychiatric care and drug and alcohol counseling that recently 
raised $2.5 million through its first sale of stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold 1.25 million units at $2 each. The units consist of two shares 
each of common stock and two stock purchase warrants, which allow owners to 
purchase more common stock on favorable terms in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The company began trading Dec. 6 on the over-the-counter market and the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "OPMCU." The units will 
trade until March, at which point the warrants and shares can be traded 
separately, the company says. Warrants are sometimes tossed into initial public 
offerings to sweeten the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Is Pleased 
</P>
<P>
Since Dec. 6 the units have sold for as much as $2.625 but were trading last 
week in a range of $2.125 to $2.25. The company said it is pleased with the 
fledgling stock's performance. 
</P>
<P>
OptimumCare was founded in 1986 after a handful of western states -- including 
California -- repealed laws requiring hospitals to get state approval before 
expanding or offering new services. 
</P>
<P>
President and Chief Executive Edward A. Johnson, 43, is also aiming at cities 
and towns in which there is little competition, according to the prospectus 
accompanying the stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was former executive vice president of operations at Irvine's 
Comprehensive Care Corp. -- operator of the Care Unit drug and alcohol abuse 
programs -- when he left the company 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of OptimumCare's strengths is that it's not capital-intensive; 
in other words, it doesn't take a lot of money to get a treatment program up 
and running. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee, OptimumCare will set up a psychiatric counseling program or drug and 
alcohol program at hospitals and nursing homes. The hospital provides the beds, 
nurses, food and billing; the company provides social workers, a psychologist 
and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to build or staff hospitals," Johnson said. "And in fact, most 
of our programs only take about five employees to run." 
</P>
<P>
But investing in OptimumCare is not without risks, the company said in its 
stock-offering prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
OptimumCare lost $1.1 million from its formation in 1986 through July, 1988. 
The company last year had to cancel its first treatment program at a 
Weaverville, Calif., hospital when it couldn't keep its beds filled with 
patients and began losing money. 
</P>
<P>
Three other programs were canceled before they even got started because the 
company couldn't come up with the capital to get them going. And OptimumCare's 
other eight contracts can be canceled if the company can't attract enough 
patients. One of the larger ones is at Western Medical Center-Anaheim. Orange 
County, Johnson acknowledged, "is one of our tougher markets because of the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, OptimumCare has a contract with an Ohio facility that has no 
competition within a 40-mile radius, Johnson said. That kind of situation is 
much closer to the company's original strategy for choosing markets. 
</P>
<P>
But in most markets, competition is stiff from bigger, older and 
better-established companies. And OptimumCare's treatment programs don't differ 
much from these companies' programs, according to its prospectus. So the 
company will have to do intensive advertising to keep its beds filled up. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the company is already advertising on cable television in 
California and will use some of the proceeds of the stock sale to begin 
advertising on broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.5 million OptimumCare raised when it closed its public offering will 
yield about $2 million after expenses. The money will be used for marketing and 
getting new treatment programs started, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The company is optimistic about future revenue: Johnson estimated that 
OptimumCare will take in $4.5 million next year and should turn a profit. By 
1990, revenue should hit $7 million, he said.
