FEW IN NORTH COUNTY JOIN MERGER FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With almost missionary fervor, San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor has regularly 
condemned the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric with Southern 
California Edison, and has summoned other cities to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
But up in San Marcos, they don't much care that O'Connor has declared the 
utility marriage the most important issue of her political career, or that San 
Diego already has spent $2 million fighting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the attitude that San Diego has always treated North County like 
orphans," said San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau, who suggests that the county's 
crown city has a thing or two to learn about managing its own affairs before 
handing down judgments to its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
For all O'Connor's warning that the immense utility has been a pro-growth force 
in the Southland's urban sprawl, Thibadeau scoffed, "San Diego is not far from 
becoming another L.A. itself." 
</P>
<P>
And one city away from San Marcos, Escondido Mayor Doris Thurston isn't exactly 
dabbing moist eyes at the prospect of losing SDG&amp;E, with its legendary high 
energy bills for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to face the fact that Southern California Edison is on the cutting 
edge and uses state-of-the-art equipment" that could slash rates, Thurston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a year and a half since the merger plan was introduced, and -- aside 
from these comments during interviews -- so far there has been virtual 
political silence by the nine cities in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Not one city council has taken a position on the issue, and if anything, most 
cities seem to view the boiling merger controversy as a nasty little ruckus off 
in some distant land. "We are remote from the issue," said Thurston. "It's more 
or less become a City of San Diego issue." 
</P>
<P>
Although that sentiment might not be universally shared in North County, there 
is clear confusion over the complex merger proposal and a reluctance to get 
involved just yet in the issue's noisy polemics. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical comment from a North County mayor, Bud Lewis of Carlsbad groused, 
"There is so much propaganda going out, it's hard to tell what's what. We 
haven't taken a stand one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Such remarks come from the very community leaders whose aid will be sought by 
merger foes to help sway public opinion against the utility deal. The county 
Board of Supervisors has tentatively decided to hold a countywide June advisory 
election on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission are reviewing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, said he 
counts on the northern city leaders to have a "significant impact on the public 
perception" against the merger. He said "the greatest contribution the cities 
could make is participating in the advisory vote." 
</P>
<P>
In February or March, "that's when we start going around asking for their 
support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, O'Connor has already done that, appealing for backing before the San 
Diego County division of the League of California Cities and coming away with a 
letter attacking the virtue of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
But that was early in the game, in December 1988, and since then there's been 
nothing to suggest that North County is genuinely galvanized on either side of 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody in North County is taking a wait-and-see position," said 
Oceanside City Councilwoman Lucy Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
It probably would take a bolder alliance than that for San Diego to prevail. 
Paul Downey, spokesman for O'Connor, said, "It would certainly be helpful to 
San Diego's case to have strong opposition to the merger from the other 
cities." But, so far, he said, "San Diego, the county and Chula Vista have 
really been the three big players" against the merger. 
</P>
<P>
With the cities in North County more geographically and politically distant, 
San Diego may find more sympathy among its southern neighbors, such as 
Coronado, with which it has a close rapport. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado Mayor Mary Herron, whose City Council has not yet taken a position on 
the merger, said, "We're sitting back, watching the big guns shoot at each 
other. . . . We see no real reason to get drawn into it as yet." 
</P>
<P>
However, Coronado's mere proximity to San Diego has resulted in the two cities' 
working together to solve mutual problems such as sewage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize it as a cordial relationship," said Herron, adding, 
though, that the key factor in deciding whether to back the merger is whether 
it would lower utility rates for Coronado residents. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council voted unanimously Nov. 30 to oppose melding 
SDG&amp;E with Rosemead-based Edison to create a 4.8-million-customer utility 
district, the nation's largest. The vote came one year after SDG&amp;E 
directors approved a $2.4-billion stock trade offer with Edison's parent 
company, SCEcorp. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor pronounced it the "most important merger in this country" and the most 
critical issue of her political career. Her council's vote authorized City 
Atty. John Witt to determine whether the city has legal power to block the 
merger by refusing to let SDG&amp;E transfer city franchise agreements to 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Those franchises give SDG&amp;E the right to send electricity, gas and steam 
using city streets, highways and rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
While a court ruling on that franchise question is sought, the broader 
controversy rages on. It focuses on whether the merger would mean loss local 
control over providing energy, result in higher or lower rates for consumers, 
how it would affect the county's environment and whether it would cause 
SDG&amp;E jobs to be eliminated in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents glumly regard the merger as promising only to foul San Diego County 
with everything that's evil about Los Angeles, with its pell-mell development 
and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But most North County city governments, for a variety of reasons, aren't quite 
willing yet to embrace that characterization of the merger, and the issue 
surely hasn't aroused the public. "Usually the people are very good about 
talking with me when something is on their mind," said Vista Mayor Gloria 
McClellan. "There just hasn't been much interest expressed." Her comment was 
echoed throughout North County. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the merger hasn't stirred much emotion is that San Diego is often 
seen as having a separate political reality from North County, where smaller 
cities face the crush of their own local problems. 
</P>
<P>
Vista, population 61,000, is chiefly worried about school crowding. Oceanside, 
with 107,000 people, is grappling with street gangs, growth and downtown 
redevelopment. Poway, 41,000, is struggling against outside-generated traffic 
congestion to keep its rural image. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach Mayor Marion Dodson said of the utility merger: "There seems to be 
a lot of apathy. It's not a city issue. We have other, more local issues." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, O'Connor has a fundamentally different opinion on the merger's 
countywide significance. Downey, the mayor's spokesman, said "the people in 
North County will be affected as adversely as the people in San Diego. They 
have a large stake in this. There's the likelihood of increased rates, 
increased pollution and loss of local control." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another perspective comes from Larry O'Donnell Jr., chief spokesman for San 
Diegans for the Merger. 
</P>
<P>
"North County feels it's growing and has its own set of problems," he said. 
"The city of San Diego is kind of like a big brother that sits there and tries 
to speak on behalf of the entire county." 
</P>
<P>
However, enemies of the merger who want to keep local control by holding fast 
to SDG&amp;E labor under a rather general dislike for the utility company, 
which alienated many customers by dramatically raising rates during the 1970s. 
Although energy bills are lower now, SDG&amp;E is still known as having some of 
the highest rates in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad's Lewis said "SDG&amp;E has had a bad record. During the crunch of the 
70s, we were paying more for energy than any other utility around. They've got 
a poor management record." 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Mayor Pam Slater complained that "SDG&amp;E has suffered from some 
mismanagement. I feel we're paying way in excess of what we should be paying." 
Yet she might not be happier with a merger, arguing that any non publicly-owned 
utility "is a monopoly and an opportunity for the public to be ripped off. And 
we have been ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's rates have fostered among some North County politicians a 
willingness to at least hear what Edison would offer through a merger and not 
dismiss the utility simply because it is identified with the Los Angeles area. 
As Escondido's Mayor Thurston put it: "I'm not as sensitive to the big city as 
some people are." 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions to that view, such as Del Mar Mayor Brooke Eisenberg, 
whose council hasn't voted whether to actually oppose the merger but has 
"voiced some strong concern" over fear that "we would become an appendage in 
the Southern California Edison conglomerate." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, North County government leaders are inundated with 
facts from organizations on both sides of the merger question, and few local 
politicians know what to believe. Slater said, "We've (council members) 
individually been given a barrage of paper to read." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, that has created much ambiguity about the merger and a desire 
among North County's cities to do little or nothing politically until an 
objective party completes findings on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the jury's still out on the facts," said Poway Deputy Mayor Jan 
Goldsmith. "We all expressed a desire to receive facts from an independent 
source. . . . A lot of these issues are beyond the smaller cities." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some cities have placed a high premium on research undertaken by the 
Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The 
cities' delay in political involvement until more is known suits O'Donnell 
fine. "If San Diego is so upset," he said, "why aren't the North County cities 
so upset? Because they're acting correctly."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PROLIFIC WRITER POOH-POOHS PRETENSIONS OF THE LITERATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the Rodney Dangerfield complex. 
</P>
<P>
Genre paperbacks -- Westerns, action-adventures, romances, etc. -- outsell the 
more literary stuff by a mile. But they don't get the respect given to their 
hardback cousins; no reviews in the Sunday newspaper, no book tours, no 
admiring interviews on "SunUp San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Chet Cunningham, 61, a former newspaperman who lives in San Carlos, thinks 
that's wrongheaded and 
</P>
<P>
snobbish. He's just had his 200th paperback published, "Canyon O'Grady: The 
Lincoln Assignment" (Signet. $3.50). 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a grouchy letter to Times book editor Jack Miles. "Don't you feel a 
bit silly, unneeded, elitist?" he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
I went out to Beaver Lake Drive to see the man who has written the continuing 
exploits of Marcus Quinn, Mack Bolan ("The Penetrator"), Major Harding, Matthew 
J. Hawke (an avenging drug agent based in San Diego), Jim Steel and more. 
Sometimes Cunningham uses his own name; sometimes a nom de word-processor. 
</P>
<P>
The most he ever made for a book was $10,000; the least, $300. The most copies 
he ever sold was 340,000 for a Mack Bolan (200,000 were in French). 
</P>
<P>
He takes pride in never missing a deadline or using an anachronism (Did you 
know that "bouncer" wasn't used until 1865 and "alibi" until 1909?). He thinks 
writer's block is a bunch of horse-droppings. 
</P>
<P>
"Writer's block was invented by people trying to sell memberships in writers' 
clubs," he says. "Did you ever hear of plumber's block?" 
</P>
<P>
All his protagonists are 28 years old, 6-foot-4, and 220 pounds, with lean, 
hard muscles. His favorite hero is Buckskin Lee Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a tough life," he says. "There's a wanted poster out on him put out 
by a crooked sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
He's peeved that newspapers don't run their book sections more like their 
sports pages, with coverage not just for major sports and big-time teams but a 
little space for lacrosse and boccie ball as well. He's not discouraged, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm writing books that people actually read." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Go Directly to Bird Rock 
</P>
<P>
Here's some more. 
</P>
<P>
* Sales are going well for La Jollaopoly, the board game invented by a San 
Diegan and marketed by Elusive Dream Marketing Services of El Cajon. It's a 
Monopoly knockoff featuring the names of prominent local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Stand by for San Diegoopoly and Seattleopoly (both by the end of January), 
Portlandopoly and Albuquerqueopoly (later in the spring) and Los Angelesopoly 
(bilingual). And possibly Orange Countyopoly, Kansas Cityopoly and 
Riverside-San Bernardinoopoly. 
</P>
<P>
All are in the works. Researchers are finding the essence of each region and 
salesmen are pitching businesses on spending $1,400 for a square on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for Lakesideopoly. It's hard to get those biker bars to plunk down 
that kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
* Former Del Mar Mayor Ronnie Delaney plans to challenge Assemblywoman Sunny 
Mojonnier in June's Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, 44, was on the council from 1984 to 1988 before being swept out by the 
continuing "green" revolution. 
</P>
<P>
* Every so often Camp Pendleton has artillery practice that rattles windows all 
over North County. The Marine Corps generally explains to annoyed civilians 
that a little racket is a small price to pay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But even the Corps has limits when it comes to noise. 
</P>
<P>
Boom boxes in private cars have just been banned on base. Military police are 
furiously writing tickets to stomp out the ear-splitting scourge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bronx Cheer in Mission Valley 
</P>
<P>
As proof of San Diego's right-thinking conservativism, the Wall Street Journal 
mentioned in an editorial that patrons at B. Dalton bookstore in Mission Valley 
applauded when Robert Bork arrived for a book-signing party. 
</P>
<P>
That's true. 
</P>
<P>
It's also true that Bork was an hour late, and someone who was there remembers 
the applause as mocking, like when the Padres finally get the third out after 
the Giants have scored 10 runs.

CHULA VISTA JAIL CALM AFTER RIOT FORCES LOCK-DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANNETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calm was restored Sunday at the San Diego County Jail in Chula Vista after 27 
inmates were injured in a Saturday night riot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No law enforcement officers were injured in the 20-minute fracas, which began 
about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cellblock 3-A was locked down after a major disturbance between black and 
Latino inmates broke out in a common area and the inmates refused to return to 
their cells, said San Diego County Sheriff's Capt. Charles Wood, the jail 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The lock-down, in which inmates are confined to their cells, was lifted Sunday 
after an undisclosed number of inmates were transferred to other county jails. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, 113 inmates were being housed in a cellblock 
designed to accommodate 24 people, Wood said. The jail, designed to confine 192 
inmates, held 782 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The cellblock was built with 24 rooms to hold 24 people, said Sgt. Cesar 
Diosdado, jail watch commander. Of the 113 inmates, 72 were in cells, while the 
others were assigned to bunks in the day area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted Deputy Jim Cooke as saying that prisoners, "tore 
mirrors off the wall. Light fixtures were torn down. Some of the bunks were 
disassembled and the parts were used as weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The cellblock is not expected to re-open until next week because of the 
extensive damage, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to jail guards, 30 sheriff's deputies responded to the incident, as 
well as about 15 officers from the Chula Vista Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the injured inmates were transported to hospitals throughout San 
Diego for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, three other disturbances resulted in inmate injuries at the jail. 
Cooke said the Chula Vista facility is the most crowded county jail. 
</P>
<P>
A national survey released last year reported that San Diego's jails are the 
the nation's most overcrowded detention facilities. The study, which examined 
27 jail systems with 1,000 or more inmates, found that county jails operated at 
212% of capacity during 1988. An average daily prisoner population of 3,702 was 
squeezed into jails with an official capacity of 1,743, the survey reported. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, San Diego voters narrowly approved a ballot measure -- Proposition A 
-- that authorized a half-cent sales tax increase for new jails and courts. 
Over its 10-year life, Proposition A was projected to raise $1.6 billion to 
relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
However, in March, 1989, the measure was ruled unconstitutional by Riverside 
County Superior Court Judge Gordon Burkhart. Burkhart declared the sales tax 
illegal on the grounds that it fell short of the two-thirds margin mandated by 
Proposition 13, the state property tax-cutting initiative approved by voters in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
County administrators have said their only realistic hope of alleviating jail 
overcrowding lies in overturning the court ruling that struck down Proposition 
A. 
</P>
<P>
The county's six jails have been the target of several suits filed by the 
American Civil Liberties Union. A court settlement reached before the demise of 
Proposition A called for inmate population at the South Bay jail to be reduced 
to 373 by July 1.

WITHOUT BATTLE INTELLIGENCE, THIS WAR CAN'T BE WON; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: AERIAL SPRAYING OF THE PEST PRESUMES KNOWLEDGE OF ITS BEHAVIOR. PROBLEM 
IS, THE STATE'S ERADICATORS HAVEN'T A CLUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BUNN, David Bunn is research director of Pesticide Watch, a statewide 
citizen-based organization working to reduce the use of dangerous pesticides in 
agricultural and urban environments. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In declaring a Medfly "state of emergency" in August, Gov. George Deukmejian 
gave the State Department of Food and Agriculture and county agriculture 
commissioners the power to spray malathion at will. Yet the goal of eradicating 
the pest is doomed, no matter how much of the pesticide is rained on Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be eradicators presume to know the exact locations of Medfly 
colonies. But they overlook an important behavioral trait of the pest: The fly 
is territorial. It repeatedly returns to one tree, bypassing the tree with the 
trap that is only 10 yards away. Thus, it is likely that there are pockets of 
Medflies throughout the two counties that trapping will completely miss. Worse, 
when a Medfly is caught, the eradicators don't really know what that indicates. 
Are there five or 5,000 others on the loose? 
</P>
<P>
Eradication also presumes that the pest will stay away for many years. Wrong 
again. Medflies were found in Los Angeles County in eight of the last 10 years, 
and scientists agree the fly will continue to populate the area because of the 
enormous volume of travelers moving between California and other countries with 
Medfly populations. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department of Food and Agriculture, nonetheless, claims its aerial 
spraying in Santa Clara County in the early '80s wiped out the Medfly. Top 
entomologists have an alternative explanation for the pest's disappearance: two 
consecutive cold winters. The adult Medfly cannot tolerate temperatures below 
45 degrees or above 105 degrees for more than a few hours. When immature, they 
cannot survive temperatures below 40 degrees for a similar period of time. The 
climate in most of California's valleys and major farming regions is thus not 
hospitable to the pest. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, aerial spraying is unnecessary, because trees do not need to be 
drenched with the malathion bait spray to catch a Medfly. The bait is designed 
to be selectively applied. As such, a short burst of the pesticide from the 
ground is adequate in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
That still leaves the question of whether the Medfly has developed a resistance 
to malathion. The pesticide kills active adult flies but is largely ineffective 
during the winter. Beyond that, nobody knows. The effect of malathion on such 
beneficial insects as bees is less uncertain: It kills them. Similarly, 
predator insects, such as ladybugs, that are crucial to controlling pests that 
damage plants or crops are also destroyed by the spraying. By indiscriminately 
dousing with malathion, the state is preparing the ground for other pests that 
will require more pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Humans, of course, also are affected by malathion spraying. The chemical 
attacks the nervous and immune systems. It may cause cancer or birth defects. 
But like most pesticides in use today, research on its long-term health effects 
is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Following the aerial spraying of malathion on Northern California in 1981-82, 
numerous suits were filed against the state. More than $2 billion in damages 
was sought. Claims to recover the costs of restoring auto paint totaled $16 
million, of which $3.7 million was paid. The bill for similar damage to cars in 
Southern California will likely be much more. The price tag of the 
health-related suits could be astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical-intensive strategy of eradicating the Medfly is irrational, 
wasteful and damaging to our health and the environment. The state would be far 
wiser to develop a "control program" that would include the release of Medfly 
parasites and predators, the use sterile flies, occasional fruit stripping, 
posting of chemical traps or limited applications of malathion bait on trees.

LOCAL LAPSES, NATIONAL DILEMMA; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: HIGHER, BETTER-ENFORCED STANDARDS WILL HELP. BUT ULTIMATELY, ONLY 
UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE WILL END SUBSTANDARD CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN F. SHAPIRO and RICHARD L. KRAVITZ, Martin F. Shapiro and Richard L. 
Kravitz are physicians on the faculty of the Department of Medicine of UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California obstetrician is convicted of murdering eight newborn babies, the 
result of his repeatedly engaging in grossly incompetent practices. The Board 
of Medical Quality Assurance is accused of laxity for not having suspended his 
license when it first investigated several of the deaths. As horrible as this 
case and other recent reports of doctor lapses are, the idea that we can turn 
to the courts to ensure that everyone receives appropriate health care is a sad 
delusion. 
</P>
<P>
If we are serious about ensuring good care, four issues must be addressed: 
</P>
<P>
Gross incompetence. This problem is supposed to be identified by state 
regulatory agencies. Yet there are no standards to guide them, no mechanism for 
ensuring the quality of the judges themselves. In most states, boards of 
quality assurance confirm the credentials of physicians seeking a license. 
Periodically, they suspend doctors guilty of outrageous misconduct. But rarely 
do the boards take action in other cases. In some states, quality boards do 
even less, their work hampered by inadequate funding and the reluctance of 
physicians to blow the whistle on their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Variations in outcomes of care. Even if all the grossly incompetent physicians 
in the world were purged from the profession tomorrow, patients would still die 
unnecessarily. Physicians in a hospital where 25% of the heart-attack patients 
die are not grossly incompetent. But, all other things being equal, who 
wouldn't want to be cared for in a hospital with a 20% mortality rate? 
</P>
<P>
Research linking what physicians do to how their patients fare is just 
beginning. In time, it will serve as a basis for patient-care standards to 
which physicians can be held accountable. Until then, comparing outcome rates 
remains the only way consumers can assess the relative competence of 
health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Care Financing Administration currently releases statistics on the 
mortality rates in hospitals caring for the elderly. But the numbers don't tell 
us if hospitals with the higher death rates also provide poorer care, because 
these rates may also result from random variations or from taking care of more 
seriously ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessary care. National studies suggest that a large minority of surgical 
and other procedures are unnecessary. These procedures, for which physicians 
are paid handsomely, can have serious complications. For example, the risk of 
death after carotid-artery surgery may be as high as 5%. Is the surgeon who 
performs such an operation blameless in the event of the patient's death? 
</P>
<P>
Lack of access to care. Most babies who die unnecessarily in the United States 
do not do so because the obstetrician was incompetent. The infant-mortality 
rate is high largely because the poor receive inadequate prenatal care and 
nutrition. Currently, the United States is worst among 19 leading 
industrialized nations in infant mortality, and the rate is nearly twice as 
high among nonwhites as among whites. If an obstetrician must spend the rest of 
his life in jail for the deaths of eight infants, how should we view political 
leaders who have cut nutrition programs and prenatal care? 
</P>
<P>
The case, then, for organized medicine to develop explicit national 
patient-care standards is compelling. The American Medical Assn. is taking a 
hesitant step in this direction by agreeing to generate a set of "practice 
parameters." Once these standards are in place, medical quality boards should 
be given the resources to enforce them. 
</P>
<P>
As for states, they should devote more resources to efforts seeking to 
determine whether mortality differences among hospitals or practitioners are 
the result of poorer quality of care or sicker patients. Such studies may 
reveal that more money is needed to provide good care, particularly in public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way to develop standards for selected medical procedures. For 
example, the RAND Corp. has assembled expert panels to determine when it is 
necessary to perform such procedures as gastrointestinal endoscopy (passing a 
tube into the stomach), cardiac catheterization (inserting a tube into the 
heart) and gall bladder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
This is well and good. But there is also a need to improve compliance with such 
standards. It might help to remove the carrot -- paying physicians no more for 
doing a procedure than for spending comparable time and effort examining a 
patient. Medicare is moving in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
Access to quality medical care, however, cannot be adequately addressed until 
everyone has insurance and no provider has an incentive to prefer the insurance 
of one patient over that of another because of reimbursement or red tape. It is 
hard to imagine this happening in the absence of a system in which everyone's 
insurance comes from one source -- a government-sponsored program. Until then, 
poor women will be at special risk for receiving substandard care, and babies 
will die.

FRITTERING AWAY OUR COMMON GOALS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: CALIFORNIA'S LAWMAKERS PASS TOO MANY FRIVOLOUS OR PATHETICALLY 
NARROW BILLS. LACK OF STRATEGIC PLANNING IS THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH FISCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Southern California, a savings and loan institution collapsed and thousands 
of people lost their life savings. In Northern California, a freeway overpass 
collapsed and dozens of people lost their lives. A variety of factors 
contributed to these disasters, but the lack of strategic planning in the 
California Legislature may also have played a part. 
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, strategic planning involves three tasks: choosing goals, 
determining priorities and following a course of action that leads toward the 
goals. How well is the Legislature performing these tasks? 
</P>
<P>
Choosing goals is relatively easy, as they must reflect the electorate. No 
legislator who wants to be reelected would actively oppose education, health 
care, police and fire protection, a clean environment, or the opportunity to 
prosper; no politician would be likely to support a tax increase without 
abundant justification. We hold these values, in California as elsewhere, to be 
self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
But the second task of strategic planning, determining priorities, seems to 
represent a problem for the Legislature. In the state budget, as in most 
household budgets, there is never enough money for everything. Depending on 
personal philosophy and party affiliation -- not to mention campaign 
contributions -- legislators differ significantly in how they believe competing 
interests should be reconciled. It is a complex task, given the diversity of 
California, to balance the concerns of groups and individuals with the good of 
the state as a whole. But it is precisely this that we pay our state lawmakers 
to do, in a forum that encourages them to share their views. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature has a monumental amount of information at its disposal to 
assist in establishing priorities. More than 1,000 reports were sent to each 
house during the 1987-88 session. The legislative counsel prepares opinions and 
analyses of proposed bills, the legislative analyst advises on their fiscal 
impact, and each house has its own office of research. As bills pass through 
committees, testimony is given by experts from within and without state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than use this information to set priorities, the Legislature often seems 
to disregard both expert opinion and the dictates of common sense. Lawmakers 
introduce bills piecemeal, apparently in reaction to pressure from potential 
supporters or recent crises, and without regard to how each bill may affect the 
achievement of other goals. 
</P>
<P>
While problems were brewing with Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the Legislature, 
at the behest of the savings industry and its state overseers, exempted 
directors of federal savings and loan associations from liability for monetary 
damages to the S&amp;Ls or their stockholders. Clearly this law protects the 
few at the risk of the many. On the subject of freeways, they increased the 
fine for littering from $500 to $1,000, requiring an enormous expenditure for 
changing signs. Yet the warnings about the deterioration of the state's 
infrastructure, sounded in a 1984 report to the Assembly committee on policy 
research management, appear to have gone largely unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the laws for which counties must pay, to the point that Northern 
California's Butte County has threatened to file bankruptcy unless the state 
provides financial aid to carry out the mandated programs. It is questionable 
whether legislators would give these programs priority if the money came out of 
the state budget, yet laws that render counties insolvent won't lead the state 
to its goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature cannot succeed at the third task of strategic planning, 
following an appropriate course of action, when it has failed to establish 
priorities. But it should not be too much to ask that they avoid obvious dead 
ends. Many of each session's bills are of little value, and the $7,000 
estimated cost for introducing each one could be better used for other 
purposes. For example, the 1989 session produced a law requiring the director 
of food and agriculture to review a federal timetable, an action that might 
simply have been requested; another established legal standards for light 
eggnog; a third requires the governor to issue an annual proclamation of Dec. 7 
as Pearl Harbor Day. Last year, both the Senate and the Assembly considered a 
bill adopting the banana slug as the official state mollusk. 
</P>
<P>
California's future is being forged, in many cases irrevocably, by the 
decisions of today. To the extent that the Legislature is leading the state 
anywhere, it appears to be away from our commonly agreed goals rather than 
toward them.

BOTH DRIVERS HELD IN CRASH THAT KILLED 2 PASSENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two elderly people were killed when a car in which they were riding collided 
with a van at a Van Nuys intersection, Los Angeles police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers of both vehicles involved in the accident were arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Lester Salazar, 85, of Van Nuys and 66-year-old 
Rosaleen Henszley of Santa Monica. They were passengers in a Toyota Cressida 
driven by Henszley's husband, Robert, 65, said Officer Ron Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said the Toyota was turning left from Woodman Avenue onto Victory 
Boulevard about 10 p.m. Saturday when it was struck by a Ford van driven by 
Apolinar V. Villasenor, 32, of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said Villasenor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and 
remained jailed Sunday on a charge of felony manslaughter. Robert Henszley, who 
remained hospitalized Sunday, was also arrested on suspicion of drunk driving 
and is expected to be charged with felony manslaughter, the officer said.

MIDDLE EAST AND DOMINO THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funny thing about the domino theory. It never worked as advertised when what 
was feared was the loss of Third-World countries to communism. But now that 
communism itself is being routed in Eastern Europe, the domino theory appears 
to be working like gangbusters. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that the rush toward democracy under 
way in the East Bloc will now extend beyond the borders of Europe, overtaking, 
perhaps, the Middle East. In that region, otherwise inexorable momentums have 
an odd way of running aground. This is not to say that the region isn't due for 
greater democratization. 
</P>
<P>
But with thousands of battle-hardened Iraqi troops still in uniform and 
squaring off, this time against Syria in Lebanon; with Syrian and Palestinian 
and Christian forces themselves poised at each other's jugular for a new round 
of fighting; with Muslim fundamentalism endangering the moderate regimes of 
Egypt and Jordan, and with the mainstay of the Arab world still determined not 
to accept a secure Jewish state in the vicinity, a Middle Eastern version of 
what the Czechs are calling the "Velvet Revolution" is hardly in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
And as the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are discovering after two 
fruitless years of violence, the walls of Jericho are made of sterner stuff 
than their counterpart in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have not yet grasped what the Czechs realized instinctively -- 
that peaceful means and reasonable intentions can render the most dramatic 
results. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere in East Europe, the struggle for democracy was 
waged at the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank and Gaza, unfortunately, the opposite has occurred. At the 
grass-roots level, the Palestinians have demonstrated an unyielding addiction 
to violence while refusing to embrace the path of peaceful negotiation Israel 
has traditionally indicated it would respond to.

SPRINKLERS IN THE HOT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald Manning is justifiably disappointed because the 
City Council is dragging its feet on mandatory sprinklers for high-rise 
apartments and condominiums. After months of talk without action -- and in the 
aftermath of the recent $25-million blaze in a high-rise condominium in 
Westwood -- the chief is pressing for a strong residential sprinkler ordinance 
now. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to come up today before the council's Public Safety 
Committee. An ordinance, proposed by Councilman Richard Alatorre would require 
sprinklers in the hallways of all residential buildings taller than six 
stories. The new law would also require at least one sprinkler head in every 
apartment in buildings taller than 13 stories. The requirement reflects a 
stronger commitment to fire safety, but it is diluted by an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alatorre deserves credit for keeping the issue alive despite 
torrential protests from condominium associations and landlords, his proposal 
would allow an exemption for significant asbestos removal, a common problem in 
older buildings. Removing the carcinogenic substance can raise the cost of 
installing sprinklers from $4 per square foot to more than $20 per square foot. 
The removal process, opponents say, also displaces residents. The expense and 
inconvenience are legitimate concerns, but the protection is indispensable when 
a life-threatening fire breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
After the deadly First Interstate building fire in May, 1988, the council 
approved mandatory sprinklers for all tall commercial buildings, but rejected a 
similar requirement for residential high-rises. Sprinklers could have kept the 
Westwood fire from spreading and reduced damages by as much as 90% at the 
14-story Wilshire Terrace, according to fire officials, a reminder that the 
most advanced protections against fire are as important where people live as 
they are where people work.

The right wing is certainly out to get Sen. Cranston.

<P>
Sure (Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan President Charles), Keating contributed to 
Cranston's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Keating gave to both parties. He gave to Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. 
Wasn't there a state official to check on savings and loans? If so, where was 
he? 
</P>
<P>
What about M. Danny Wall, appointed by President Reagan to keep an eye on 
federal savings and loans? Obviously he didn't. And he didn't need campaign 
money. He was appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Senators need campaign money. It's the American way -- the only way senators 
and presidents ever get elected. 
</P>
<P>
Wall probably knew that President Reagan was against government checking up on 
business.

L.A. TURNING INTO BOOK COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An annual, admirable street fair in New York goes by the title "New York Is 
Book Country." True enough: At annual book sales of $283.2 million (for 1987, 
the most recent year for which final figures are available), New York has been 
the nation's largest book market for as long as anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles-Long Beach is closing fast and may in fact be in first place 
already. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 to 1987, book sales here rose from $176 million to $265.6 million, an 
increase of $90 million. During the same period, New York sales rose by only $5 
million. Per capita sales in New York declined during that triennium from 
$87.54 to $82.93; per capita sales here rose from $61.61 to $85.76. Even a 
modest continuation of those trends during 1988 and 1989 would make Los 
Angeles-Long Beach the largest book market in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in gross sales is steep from the two mega-markets to third-place 
Boston ($168.8 million); but what these recently released U.S. Dept. of 
Commerce statistics really show is how admirably polycentric and unpredictable 
the book market continues to be. Thus, though the highest per capita figures 
typically come from college towns (like Austin, Texas, in first place, with 
$195.86), San Jose -- without a major research university bookstore -- weighs 
in at an impressive $164.25 per capita. San Jose is flourishing book country, 
and so is Los Angeles.

<P>
Why has the national Latino education leadership been so quiet on the subject 
of school choice? 
</P>
<P>
To answer that question, place yourself in a typical classroom in almost any 
school where Latino children are the majority. Now imagine yourself answering a 
set of true/false questions: 
</P>
<P>
1) My class is small; 2) My classroom has enough desks for everybody; 3) My 
classmates all have their own textbooks; 4) My school environment is safe; 5) 
My instructors are regular, fully credentialed teachers; 6) My teachers think 
I'm smart and encourage me; 7) My classes are interesting and demanding; 8) My 
school has excellent instructional resources; 9) My school has a strong 
academic reputation. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered true to more than three of these questions you are the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
California's 1974 Seranno vs. Priest decision, which mandated equal spending 
limits per pupil, did not alter the pattern of inequitable distribution of 
educational resources, nor did the education-reform movement of the past decade 
result in significant improvements in the conditions of schooling and the 
achievement levels of Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos did not become politically empowered during the past decade, and 
therefore have not been able to make education policy and influence the 
delivery of educational services. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Latinos were not significant participants in the national 
education agenda. The debate over school choice offers us an opportunity to 
change this. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos has proclaimed that "choice empowers 
people by bringing them into the decision-making process. It encourages 
teachers and principals to become entrepreneurs and structure their curriculum 
and standards; students are encouraged to become learners with options that 
direct and capture their interest, and parents become involved as 
decision-makers." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, in whose state open enrollment made its debut, 
declares that "Families can make a choice about where to send their kids to 
school. School boards will have to respond to the market forces, whereas before 
they didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Bastian, of the New World Foundation, argues that "choice . . . is not 
a quick fix for school improvement. There is nothing in the choice concept that 
makes it automatically achieve such goals as quality, diversity and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Moore, author of a study on school choice ("The New Improved Sorting 
Machine"), states: "In many instances, public-school choice is becoming a new 
form of segregation, creating multitiered and unequal educational 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Who and what to believe? 
</P>
<P>
In its principal manifestation (magnet schools), school choice does not provide 
better educational opportunities for all students. Rather, it reinforces 
inequities and stratification. In Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor tells us, all 
the children are above average. One would assume that all the schools of that 
imaginary community are, too. But what meaning does choice have if the schools 
in one's community are bad or mediocre? If above-average schools are 
geographically inaccessible? Or if choice is restricted to above-average 
students? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the analogy linking commerce and school choice, however appealing, is 
flawed. Latino purchasing power, for example, has not resulted in high-quality 
goods and services at lower prices in Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
School choice would be a significant option if Latinos were both economically 
and politically empowered. Until we are empowered, however, we must not allow 
the marketing efforts of school-choice proponents to distract us from the real 
and substantive tools that we must have to improve the education of all our 
children: small teacher-student ratios; good facilities; safe learning 
environments; substantive curricula; good instructional resources, and 
teachers, counselors and administrators with appropriate preparation and high 
expectations for their students. These can and should be provided to all 
children in all of America's schools.

<P>
CHINA: THE LEADERSHIP THAT GAVE US THE TIAN AN MEN MASSACRE LOOKS TO EVENTS IN 
ROMANIA AND ASSESSES THE OUTCOME WITH DOWNRIGHT ALARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Timisoara and Tian An Men. The parallels were striking, enough so to make 
China's aging oligarchs visibly nervous: An intransigent Communist regime, 
facing a rising tide of democratic protest fueled by deepening economic 
contradictions, employs deadly force to halt the spread of "bourgeois 
liberalization," in the process slaughtering scores of unarmed civilians. 
</P>
<P>
For the authors of last June's Beijing massacre, it was, in Yogi Berra's 
immortal words, "deja vu all over again" -- until the people of Romania 
dramatically altered the script by overthrowing their Communist government and 
executing the dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. At the point, Chinese nervousness 
turned to outright alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Already forced on the defensive by their inability -- more than six months 
after the Tian An Men incident -- to regain public credibility at home and 
restore investor confidence abroad, Chinese authorities quickly erected a wall 
of defiance to shield them against the fallout from the Romanian revolution. 
Dismissing out of hand all hints of similarity between conditions in Bucharest 
and Beijing, they quietly beefed up security forces in their capital and placed 
them on standby alert. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, government "truth squads" were dispatched to college campuses 
in Beijing to calm down restive students and to propagate the party line on 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
That line is both complex and convoluted. Officially, Beijing's response to the 
demise of Ceausescu has been to publicly congratulate the new Romanian 
government of Ion Iliescu and to pledge continued bilateral friendship and 
cooperation. Privately, however, Chinese leaders are disseminating to party 
cadres two radically different versions of the Romanian upheaval -- one for 
domestic consumption (blaming Mikhail Gorbachev for undermining socialism and 
stirring up political unrest in Eastern Europe) and another designed to assuage 
the fears of foreigners (presenting a more balanced, neutral view of 
Ceausescu's downfall). 
</P>
<P>
Such contorted explanations are unlikely to prove effective. Reports from the 
Chinese capital indicate that anti-government wall posters have begun to 
reappear on dormitory buildings at Beijing and Quinghua universities. 
</P>
<P>
Like a proverbial bad penny, memories of Tian An Men keep turning up to haunt 
China's leaders. Public anger, generally kept under wraps since the bloody 
crackdown of June 3-4, has periodically percolated to the surface, attaching 
itself to convenient symbols of government repression. 
</P>
<P>
Government fears of renewed urban unrest have been further fueled by recent bad 
news on the economic front. Industrial output plummeted in September and 
October, resulting in negative growth for the first time in a decade. Some 
factories have reportedly cut wages and there have been persistent rumors that 
workers will have to forgo cash bonuses -- supplemental income considered vital 
to survival in an economy marked by fixed low wages and inflationary price 
hikes. Industrial sabotage and other incidents of passive resistance are said 
to be on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
What China's leaders fear most is the conjoining of student and worker unrest. 
It was just such a fusion that made possible last spring's pro-democracy 
movement, prompting authorities to invoke martial law in Beijing. A similar 
fusion presaged autumn's tidal wave of popular protest in Eastern Europe, 
culminating in the collapse of Communist regimes throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Few observers are predicting an imminent recurrence of large-scale political 
disturbances in China. Yet the mood in Beijing remains strained, with strong 
undercurrents of indignation. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing's attempt to sweep the carnage of June 3-4 under the rug was rendered 
ineffective by the presence of too many eyewitnesses, too many video cameras 
and fax machines, too many radios tuned to BBC and the Voice of America. It is 
striking that the citizens of Romania also relied heavily upon BBC, VOA and 
Radio Free Europe to keep abreast of local and international developments 
throughout their December upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Romanian revolution, China's leaders find themselves 
more isolated and embattled than before. But their rigid, circle-the-wagons 
attitude bodes poorly for China's future tranquility. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does it bode well for China's visibly strained relations with the United 
States. Since last June, the Bush Administration has taken a calculated risk, 
making a series of near-term concessions in hopes that the forces of moderation 
and restraint within China would thereby be strengthened. In the wake of the 
Timisoara and Bucharest massacres, Bush's gamble has been angrily assailed as a 
form of appeasement -- or "kowtowing" -- by a rising chorus of U.S. 
congressional and media critics, many of whom are now calling for a tougher 
line against Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background of heightened tension at home and increasing isolation 
abroad, China's leaders face an uncertain future. Unable to terminate martial 
law in Beijing for fear of unleashing new urban unrest, yet painfully aware of 
the fate that befell Bucharest's unyielding, hard-line Communists, Deng 
Xiaoping and his associates are riding a tiger. In the aftermath of the 
Romanian uprising, they are less likely to manage a soft dismount.

EAST EUROPE: ONE WHO SUFFERED THE AFTERMATH OF PRAGUE SPRING DESCRIBES THE 
ELATION OF SEEING TODAY'S GENERATION PULL OFF THE VELVET REVOLUTION.

I met Anna in Prague on the eve of 1968, when all things seemed possible. She 
was an angelic student working in a youth hostel. I was a passing tourist. She 
led me through the gray facade of the Communist state to a magic counterculture 
of students, artists, seekers of freedom. We were infatuated with each other 
and with the times. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia 
to put down the Prague Spring. Anna, who was in England studying, decided to 
return home. I never heard from her again. Years later, I found a scrap of 
paper with her Prague address and kept it out of sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
In December, when the streets of Prague filled with students, launching the 
revolution that would bring that '60s counterculture to power, I sent a 
telegram of congratulations to Anna's 1968 address. Ten days later I received 
this letter, dated Dec. 18: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Tom: 
</P>
<P>
"It is just fantastic that I've got a wire from you. You cannot imagine what 
pleasure it is to hear from the people who share the same feeling of hope and 
happiness with us. But, to be honest, congratulations don't belong to us -- I 
mean our generation. It belongs to the students and young people -- well, in 
fact, to our children. 
</P>
<P>
"We were silent more than anything else for 20 years and we were afraid, having 
had such bad experiences and a sort of common memory stretching back to 1968. 
That is no excuse, that is reality. Even now I am afraid in some moments. 
</P>
<P>
"If I speak about our silence I mean it symbolically, because we kept doing 
something -- celebrating various sad anniversaries and being repeatedly caught 
by police and some of us beaten; organizing funny political jogging events; 
writing and signing petitions and after that, being called to the police and 
even being threatened that they would take our children from us (this happened 
to me) -- in a word, we were left in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"All this was a great advantage for young people because they didn't worry much 
about our fear, they didn't share our memory. The result was they had courage. 
</P>
<P>
"They were terribly beaten on Nov. 17 and even now we do not know whether, or 
how many, dead students there are. But that was the last drop. Since the next 
morning all Prague was marching through the streets bringing flowers and 
candles to those places and crying when we saw blood on the pavement and on the 
walls of houses. 
</P>
<P>
"There were moments we were extremely frightened when the police appeared and 
we were shouting various slogans to encourage ourselves. I remember the moment 
we were crossing the bridge (and) seeing the police troops coming across 
neighboring bridges. People couldn't stand the fear and started running. We 
thickened and thickened while rhythmically running and shouting, 'Stop being 
afraid' -- and we were very afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we are full of hope and we know it is our best chance. We have to win, 
otherwise I think I could not have survived it any more. There was too much 
disappointment after 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry you cannot see it -- so much enthusiasm, happiness, there is also 
very much fun and a lot of practical jokes. Prague is all papered and labeled 
with both serious and funny slogans. Students work on it days and nights. They 
do a lot of work and we all must succeed. Keep your fingers crossed for us, 
please, we will still need it. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not live at that address any longer, but I was lucky to get your wire. I 
got married and changed my name to Cerna. I gave birth to two daughters, Teresa 
and Katerina, I got divorced and now I live with my daughters and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my girls how enthusiastic you were when I met you here, and how kind 
you were to help me to get to England . . . You may not know that I didn't stay 
there long because of that Russian invasion. I left England immediately, never 
to come back, not even as a tourist. That was the time I realized that I wasn't 
ever able to leave my country, however stupid and bad and cowardly, and . . . 
and . . . it was. But now we hope everything will change and we will not be 
ashamed to say we are Czech. 
</P>
<P>
"I will always be very happy to hear from you again, or to see you again. I'm 
afraid it is too far, but you would like our revolution, which is given 
attributes like 'kind,' 'calm,' and 'velvet.' In a way, I am sorry that you 
live so happily not to have any revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Love, Anna"

LAKER RESERVES TAKE HEAT OFF STARTING FIVE, 132-93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So nice of the Miami Heat to drop by Sunday night and afford the Lakers the 
opportunity to rest their starters, as well as exhibit their deep bench, in the 
midst of a stretch of four games in five days. 
</P>
<P>
As close as it comes to a night off, and certainly less taxing than an average 
Pat Riley practice, the Lakers' 132-93 victory before 17,505 at the Forum was 
virtually decided in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, what the rest of the night showed -- other than the Heat's glaring 
deficiencies -- was the depth of the Laker reserves. 
</P>
<P>
That second-quarter surge that buried the Heat was made possible by three Laker 
reserves, Orlando Woolridge, Vlade Divac and Larry Drew. They helped the Lakers 
build a 26-point halftime lead that was merely a prelude to a 30-something 
bulge in the second half. Divac, playing 26 minutes, had his best game as a 
Laker, 21 points and 14 rebounds. He added three blocked shots and two steals. 
Woolridge had another strong game, scoring 14 points. Drew (eight points, seven 
assists) and Michael Cooper (11 points, five assists) were steadying 
influences, and Riley even found some minutes for recently signed Jay Vincent, 
who had played a total of four minutes in four previous games. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laker starters basically put in cameo appearances, especially in the 
second half. Their full services were needed in Saturday night's two-point loss 
to Golden State in Oakland and will probably be needed again Tuesday night when 
the Lakers play at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson played long enough to score 21 points. Center Mychal Thompson, 
still bothered by soreness in his left heel but able to play, put in only 15 
minutes. James Worthy scored all 10 of his points in his first half, and A.C. 
Green had 13 of his 19 points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Lakers' fifth in the last six games and improved their 
record to an NBA-best 23-7. The Heat ended a six-game trip without a victory, 
dropping its record to 7-27. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game, for lack of any other significant events, belonged to the Laker 
reserves. Johnson recently called this group of reserves the Lakers' deepest. 
That is debatable, but Riley could use a 10-man rotation if he so desired. And 
Sunday, there was no reason not to go with a 12-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's problem, it seems, is finding the minutes for all his reserves. 
Sixth-man extraordinaire Cooper showed his worth Saturday night against the 
Warriors by making four three-point shots. And Sunday, Woolridge, Divac and 
Drew were the early contributors to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers already had an 11-point lead when Riley sat down all of his starters 
except Worthy for the start of the second quarter. No loss there, however. The 
reserves responded by enabling the Lakers to take a 26-point lead into the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The high point came with 4:41 to play when Divac stole a pass and gave the ball 
to Drew to initiate the fast break. Drew then gave a no-look pass to Woolridge 
for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
It went on like that the rest of the night. The reserves played so well that it 
appeared the second five could have handled the Heat by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought tonight was a real good indication of our depth," Riley said. 
"We had 12 of 15 possessions in the second quarter, with our second unit, when 
we scored buckets. That showed me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Divac, whose minutes had been reduced to about 13 per game in the three 
previous games, had unquestionably his strongest showing. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good playing more," Divac said. "It is very difficult (not knowing 
how many minutes he will play). The blue team (reserves) play very, very well 
tonight. Tonight, Miami play no good." 
</P>
<P>
Truer words have seldom been spoken. But the Lakers chose to emphasize the 
positives about their efforts rather than run down the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for the bench to come in and play well," Drew said. 
"When we get into the game, we've got to pick things up. As a unit, we did that 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Laker starters, naturally, were appreciative that the reserves not only 
maintained the lead but increased it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot more versatile in what we can do with our bench," Johnson said. 
"With Vlade and Cooper and Larry and O, those guys can not only come off the 
bench (as a group), but one or two of them can play as starters, too. That's 
important to us." 
</P>
<P>
It is important because Riley will seldom play the reserves as a unit. Sunday 
night's blowout was an exception. 
</P>
<P>
"Our second group has to develop the pride as a unit," Riley said. "I think 
they've done that. We've got some talent there, and they can benefit this team, 
give us a nice lift like tonight." 
</P>
<P>
But Riley stopped short of saying the bench might develop to the point where he 
can consistently play 10 men. 
</P>
<P>
"You start going real deep like that, and you go into a platoon system," Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want that. But a lot of times we have four blues (reserves) out there 
with either James or Earvin, and they have to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although Byron Scott says that his left hamstring no longer hurts, the Laker 
guard acknowledged that his left leg has lost considerable strength. "I've been 
lifting weights (for the hamstring) all year, but I'm not even half as strong 
as I was two years ago or even a year and a half ago," Scott said. "It doesn't 
hurt. It's just weaker. I used to lift 60 or 70 pounds (on leg curls). Now it's 
25 pounds." Going into Sunday night's game, Scott had made only 37.6% of his 
field-goal attempts in road games, contrasting with 51.6% at home. 
</P>
<P>
Center Mychal Thompson, who played only 15 minutes in Saturday night's loss at 
Golden State, denied a published report that he took himself out of the game 
because of soreness in his left heel. "It wasn't that at all," Thompson said. 
"I didn't play because Golden State had a small lineup, and Riles (Coach Pat 
Riley) wanted to go small, too. The heel didn't bother me anymore than usual. 
It always bothers me, but not to where I couldn't play."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams' 19-13 victory over the Giants should be remembered as a tight, tense 
playoff game that was decided by the Los Angeles quarterback, not an official 
who made a questionable call in overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett clearly won his duel with Phil Simms and, under difficult 
circumstances, emerged as a genuine NFL star. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Everett showed a good arm, toughness, patience and leadership ability on a day 
when the Rams played their third consecutive game in the East and faced a 
vintage Lawrence Taylor. . . . The Rams' immediate goal is to win the Super 
Bowl tournament. Their next should be to re-sign the 27-year-old Everett, who 
will be eligible to file for free agency after the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't exactly as though all the calls went against the Giants. They got the 
benefit of the doubt when Simms seemed to fumble rather than throw an 
incompletion and another time when he wasn't cited for intentionally grounding 
the ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What should be second-guessed all winter is Giant Coach Bill Parcells' strategy 
late in the first half when he refused to sit on a 6-0 lead in his own 
territory and the Rams intercepted a pass to set up a touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
CBS billed a game matching teams from Anaheim and East Rutherford, N.J., as 
Hollywood vs. Broadway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A Ram unsuccessfully tried to scoop up a fumble and run with it rather than 
pounce on it, but what else is new in football?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams should be declared undisputed champions of the NFC East after going 
5-0 against that division the last nine weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Vaccaro, the oddsmaker at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, has established 
San Francisco as a seven-point favorite over the Rams and Denver as a 
four-point favorite over Cleveland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first playoff game ever between the Rams and 49ers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Forget about what John Elway has or hasn't done the rest of any particular 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He still tends to get the job done at crunch time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most surprising statistic of the day was that Pittsburgh punted only twice 
against Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jon Kolb, who was a great offensive lineman for the Steelers, is doing a great 
job coaching their offensive line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honestly, did the name Merril Hoge mean anything to you before Sunday? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half hours between kickoffs of playoff games no longer is enough, 
as we discovered Saturday. San Francisco and Minnesota were well under way on 
CBS by the time Cleveland and Buffalo finished on NBC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Teams without an outstanding quarterback, such as Minnesota, rarely make it to 
the conference championship game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana couldn't have played any better in the first half Saturday at 
Candlestick, but, as Terry Bradshaw asked, what was he doing in the game when 
the 49ers were leading, 34-6, in the fourth quarter? . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco placekicker Mike Cofer picked a great time to have an off day. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The prevent defense of Coach Bud Carson nearly prevented Cleveland from 
reaching the AFC championship game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Once you've seen Bernie Kosar run the option, you've seen everything. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Making coach-of-the-year selections before the most important part of the 
season, the playoffs, is ludicrous. So was AP's choice of Green Bay's Lindy 
Infante, who didn't even make the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Noll, four-time winner of the Super Bowl, never has been selected coach 
of the year by AP. Vince Lombardi won the honor only once. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I get the impression John Madden doesn't like the running-up-and-leaping 
penalty. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota doesn't have a clue about how to use Herschel Walker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is Jerry Glanville still denying those reports that the Houston Oilers aren't 
happy with his work? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Newsday speculates that USC linebacker Junior Seau could be taken as the second 
player in the entire NFL draft by the New York Jets if he leaves school a year 
early. . . . I hope Eric Davis finally feels appreciated in Cincinnati. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs, who beat them 
Saturday night, isn't much right now. Both score a lot of goals and give up a 
lot of goals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was fortunate that most of us were watching the Broncos and Steelers 
instead of the Bruin-Louisville basketball game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, for a respite from football, try Georgetown-Pitt, Michigan-Indiana and 
Nevada Las Vegas-New Mexico State in college hoops tonight on ESPN. . . 
</P>
<P>
Did anybody really care what CBS' pregame guest, Richard Nixon, thought about 
the Rams and Giants?

ROBBIE, DOLPHIN FRANCHISE BUILDER, DIES AT 73

Miami Dolphin owner Joe Robbie, who two years ago moved the NFL team to his own 
privately financed stadium, died Sunday at age 73, Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie, who had reportedly been ill in recent months, died at an undisclosed 
Miami-area hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I was aware he was seriously ill, but I only found out about this a half hour 
ago, and it's still a shock," Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information on the cause or exact time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and 11 children, three of which work 
for the Dolphins. Late last year, he announced the establishment of a living 
trust for the franchise that he said ensured family ownership for at least the 
next generation. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie was a successful trial lawyer when he got involved in the sport in 
August 1965 at age 49 with a franchise in the American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Robbie hired Shula as coach. In his first season, Shula improved the 
Dolphin record from 3-10-1 in 1969 to 10-4. Two years later, the team compiled 
a 17-0 record -- still the best in league history -- to give Miami its first 
NFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins repeated as NFL champion in 1973 and have won five AFC titles and 
have pro football's best record since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Dolphins moved their home games from the half-century-old Orange 
Bowl to $115 million Joe Robbie Stadium. Super Bowl XXIII was played there last 
Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie put up all his possessions -- including the Dolphins franchise -- as 
collateral to assure completion of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie was born July 7, 1916, in Sisseton, S.D. He attended Northern State 
Teachers College in Aberdeen and the University of South Dakota Law School. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie, a Democrat, served in the South Dakota Legislature. He ran 
unsuccessfully for governor in South Dakota and for a U.S. House seat in 
Minnesota.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
INVITED GUEST, 24-1 SHOT, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On a day when dartboards and Tarot cards were the handicapping tools of choice, 
it should not have surprised that R.D. Hubbard's Invited Guest, a 24-1 shot, 
won Sunday's featured San Gorgonio Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should it have been a shock that White Mischief, at 35-1, finished second 
in the 1 1/8-mile turf event, especially after her trainer, Richard Cross, 
noted before the race that his mare had a "snowball's chance in hell" of 
upsetting the likes of Colorado Dancer, Nikishka and Stylish Star. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, not all snowballs melt," said Cross, grinning after watching White 
Mischief come within a half-length of an even bigger upset. 
</P>
<P>
There must have been something in the air. For eight baffling races, favorites 
wore their dubious honor like a millstone. Invited Guest simply followed the 
lead of Hawaya Sunny in the second race (paying $83.60), His Legacy in the 
fifth ($20.60) and Lady B. Strong in the seventh ($46.60). 
</P>
<P>
The only choice to win all day was Pricey Mac in the finale, and he had to 
withstand a 10-minute stewards' inquiry before shell-shocked bettors could 
collect. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was overlooked by fans, Invited Guest always has been a favorite 
around the Richard Mandella stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish-bred daughter of Be My Guest arrived in California late in 1987, on 
the heels of a promising European career, and promptly won a division of the 
Dahlia Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
But that was her high point. In more than two frustrating seasons since, 
Invited Guest had won a few minor stakes around the country and had finished 
close to some good horses. But she never cashed in on that early promise until 
she won the San Gorgonio at age 6. 
</P>
<P>
Mandella took part of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me this long to figure out how she should be ridden," said Mandella, 
who lost a heartbreaker on Saturday when Survive barely fell short in the Las 
Flores Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the pace, said Mandella, Invited Guest needs to be taken back 
and kept behind horses for as long as possible. Reserved in this manner, she 
will consistently produce a whirlwind finish. 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard for me to tell a jockey," Mandella said. "Usually I want to give 
them the latitude to ride the race as it comes up. But with this mare, you've 
got to break her neck right out of the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Russell Baze, who won the Golden Poppy Handicap on Invited Guest last March at 
Golden Gate, confirmed Mandella's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"Bury her -- that's just what he told me," said Baze. "She's not easy to rate, 
but when you ask her, she'll give that one good punch." 
</P>
<P>
As the field ran past the stands the first time, Saros Brig was on a daylight 
lead and going easily. Stylish Star, Silver Lane and Nikishka were keeping her 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The field did a little juggling down the backstretch, as Eddie Delahoussaye 
launched a mini-move with Nikishka on the outside, and Robbie Davis angled 
Darby's Daughter to the inside, behind Stylish Star. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like Chris (McCarron on Stylish Star) had a lot of horse," said 
Davis, who had ridden Invited Guest in a Dec. 21 allowance win at Hollywood 
Park. "I figured I'd follow him and be able to get through later." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't meant to be. Stylish Star could not sustain her run, and Darby's 
Daughter was forced to take up at a crucial point. 
</P>
<P>
"You thought you were in the garden spot and it ended up being full of weeds," 
said Corey Black, who rode Saros Brig. 
</P>
<P>
With a furlong to run, Black was still in control of the race. Then they all 
came flying. As Darby's Daughter tried to get through along the inside, a 
three-horse battle was materializing out in the middle of the course. 
</P>
<P>
Charging between horses, the French mare Oeilladine looked like a winner, but 
only for a moment. Closing fast on the outside, Invited Guest took command 
inside the final 70 yards, and then had to hold off the headlong finish of 
White Mischief and Fernando Toro. 
</P>
<P>
White Mischief, who won the Hillsborough Handicap at Bay Meadows in November at 
odds of 18-1, was pinched back abruptly at the start of the San Gorgonio. Toro, 
however, discounted its effect. 
</P>
<P>
"They did me a favor," he said. "I've got to get her back behind horses right 
away anyway, and sometimes it takes a sixteenth of a mile. Today, because of 
the break, it only took a couple of jumps." 
</P>
<P>
Oeilladine was beaten by a head for second money. Stevens said she was a bit 
flat compared to her dazzling American debut 12 days earlier, when she won 
going a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was the added distance or coming right back," Stevens said 
of his mare. "The other day, though, she kept close on her own and then fired 
when I asked her. Today I kind of had to nudge her along early." 
</P>
<P>
Mandella noted after the race that Invited Guest is scheduled to be bred to top 
stallion Blushing Groom this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to get her back to Kentucky early," Mandella said. "But ever since 
the decision was made to breed her, she (has) been coming on strong. I'll talk 
it over with the owner and see how much longer she can run." 
</P>
<P>
The Invited Guest-White Mischief exacta returned $2,287. Combined with 
sixth-race winner Flying Reb ($31.20) and Lady B. Strong in the seventh, 
Invited Guest triggered an $18,952.80 triple that ranks second among Santa 
Anita's all-time payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pricey Mac, who was claimed for $32,000, gave trainer Brian Mayberry his sixth 
victory of the meeting, extending his lead to two over four pursuers . . . 
Eddie Delahoussaye and Alex Solis each won a race to remain in a tie atop the 
jockey standings going into the third week . . . Derby fever gets turned up a 
notch on Wednesday when Hollywood Futurity runner-up Farma Way meets Land Rush, 
English stakes winner Balla Cove and Laurel Futurity winner Robyn Dancer in the 
Los Feliz Stakes.

THE CASE OF THE MISSING POINT; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS BASKETBALL: BOOKKEEPING COSTS WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL A POINT IN AN 
OVERTIME LOSS TO BREA-OLINDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's tough enough to lose a close basketball game on the road against a 
nationally ranked team, but imagine losing in overtime, knowing that your team 
would have won if a point had not mysteriously vanished during regulation play? 
</P>
<P>
Washington High girls' Coach Phil Chase is left with just that after losing to 
undefeated Brea-Olinda, 59-56, in overtime Saturday night in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
With Brea-Olinda, the sixth-ranked team in the nation, according to USA Today, 
trailing the No. 13 Generals by 10 points at the end of the third quarter, 
Chase noticed Washington was missing a point. He protested that the score 
should be 45-34, instead of the official scorer's 44-34. 
</P>
<P>
Chase claimed there was a free throw that was not counted, but officials 
disagreed after checking with running scores of the official scorer from 
Brea-Olinda and the visiting scorer from Washington, who both had 44-34. 
</P>
<P>
The point proved critical to Washington, the top-rated team in the City, when 
Brea-Olinda rallied to send the game into overtime on Aimee McDaniel's 
three-point basket with 10 seconds remaining in regulation. The Wildcats, the 
top team in the Southern Section, took control in overtime when Washington's 
top players, center Charisse Sampson and guard Detra Lockhart, fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing film of the game Sunday morning, Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh 
agreed that Washington lost a point, but he said that it was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked the tape of the game and they should have had 45 at the end of the 
third quarter instead of 44," Trakh said. "It is unfortunate that a thing like 
this happened, but it was an honest mistake. This really takes away from the 
efforts by both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't notice the mistake at the time, but the referee checked with both 
scorekeepers and they had the same total." 
</P>
<P>
Chase, whose Generals also lost to Brea-Olinda in the championship game of a 
tournament in Santa Barbara early this season, said: "The person sitting there 
was just copying what the Brea scorekeeper was putting down. I keep score for 
us on the bench and I noticed the error." 
</P>
<P>
Chase does not plan to protest as Washington (14-3) heads into City Southern 
Pacific Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're 10 points ahead, you shouldn't lose anyway," Chase said. "It was a 
fun and exciting game between two good teams and it shows that we can play with 
them. Hopefully, losing this game makes the kids more dedicated to reach their 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
When told of Chase's response, Trakh replied: "I would only hope that I would 
respond like (Chase) did, but in a case like this, I don't think that I would."

HOTEL, HOUSING PLAN FOR POOR LOST TO FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
BLAZE: TRANSIENTS ARE BLAMED FOR A $500,000 FIRE THAT GUTS A VACANT SKID ROW 
BUILDING. PLANS TO REMODEL THE STRUCTURE TO HOUSE THE POOR ARE PUT OFF 
INDEFINITELY.

<P>
A vacant Skid Row hotel that was to be renovated for low-income housing burned 
Sunday, causing $500,000 damage and jeopardizing the project's future. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at the Leonide Hotel on 5th Street broke out while Los Angeles 
firefighters were battling a small blaze on the 17th floor of one of the Arco 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the Skid Row fire was under investigation, but authorities said 
the hotel had been used by transients and drug users who may have built a 
bonfire to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive damage to the three-story brick hotel will indefinitely delay plans 
to remodel it as a low-rent residential hotel, its owners said. The hotel's 
roof buckled and its back half was gutted as a result of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Two nonprofit agencies that serve the homeless, the Los Angeles Community 
Design Center and the Chrysalis Center, bought the vacant hotel in August for 
about $1 million after securing a loan from the city Community Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's occupants, including owners of an adult bookstore and movie theater 
on the ground level, had moved out when the 80-year-old unreinforced structure 
was condemned after sustaining damage in the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Sewill, executive director of the Community Design Center, said the 
agencies had hoped to begin a $2.5-million remodeling project this spring. 
Plans called for 66 single-occupancy units, a communal kitchen and living room, 
and space for a small retail store and the Chrysalis Center, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're terribly disappointed," Sewill said. "But there will be a 
low-income residential hotel there somehow, even if it's not made of the same 
bricks." 
</P>
<P>
But Sewill said the fate of the project ultimately depends on the results of a 
Building and Safety Department inspection this week to determine whether the 
hotel must be razed. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters learned of the blaze before dawn Sunday, when someone from a 
nearby Skid Row hotel called, Assistant Chief Pete Lucarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The Leonide Hotel's alarm did not ring, probably because the hotel's power was 
off, he said, adding that vacant structures are not required to have working 
alarms. 
</P>
<P>
It took almost three hours to douse the flames, and several firefighters 
suffered minor injuries, Lucarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the nearby Baltimore Hotel, whose back wall is just 15 feet away 
across an alley from the Leonide, said Sunday the fire was so hot it blistered 
the paint on their window jambs. 
</P>
<P>
"I wet down my drapes and poured water over my windows to cool things down," 
said Baltimore Hotel resident Steven Bute, 44. "I'm surprised no one got killed 
in the fire. Everybody down here knows that place was used as a rock house. To 
get in, you had to crawl in feet first." 
</P>
<P>
Sewill said the hotel's owners fought "a constant battle" to keep the building 
boarded up so transients could not enter. 
</P>
<P>
The small blaze at one of the Arco Towers near 5th and Flower streets was 
caused by an electrical short that ignited plastic used to seal the floor while 
asbestos was being removed from the ceiling, Lucarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
That fire caused $16,000 damage.

HE CLEARS THE AIR AT U.S. FOREST RESTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a stench out in them thar woods, and anyone who has ever paused at a 
campground, picnic area or rest stop in this country's national forests knows 
precisely where it's coming from. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the public restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, they look innocent enough, painted in soothing earth tones to blend with 
the surrounding greenery. But these privies emit an odor not even the pungent 
scent of pine can disguise. One trip inside can quickly foul a visitor's 
wilderness experience. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service is well aware of the problem. Indeed, smelly toilets 
for decades have been the No. 1 complaint received by rangers from California 
to New Hampshire, top Forest Service officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time, the federal government has a solution: After years of 
painstaking research, an engineer at a Forest Service laboratory in San Dimas 
has figured out why the toilets stink. And he has designed an odor-free model. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators in Washington are overjoyed. They have formally declared 1990 
"The Year of the Sweet-Smelling Toilet" and vowed to retrofit all 12,000 johns 
now in use on Forest Service lands. Another 300 new potties built annually, 
meanwhile, will incorporate the breakthrough findings. 
</P>
<P>
Within three years, officials boldly pledge, Americans won't find a single 
smelly latrine in any of their 134 national forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The public today expects a higher level of service and more amenities, and 
part of that is a good-smelling toilet," said Richard Woodrow, the Forest 
Service's acting director of recreation. "Well, we're going to give it to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving that goal will not be cheap. Costs are estimated at up to $1,500 
apiece for the retrofits. But the toughest hurdle in the fragrant-toilet 
movement -- solving the puzzle of why the things stink -- has been cleared. And 
for that, credit must go to a man named Briar Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, 52, is a career Forest Service employee who has spent the last 17 years 
conducting research at the agency's San Dimas Technology and Development 
Center. He has tinkered with picnic tables, barbecue grills and drinking 
fountains, and has hunted for ways to bear-proof garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
But toilets, Cook said matter-of-factly in a recent interview, have been his 
life's work. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society is funny about toilets -- no one wants to talk about them," he 
said, admitting that his calling subjects him to frequent teasing by friends. 
"But the odor problem affects a lot of people. As an engineer, I view it as a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, unraveling this mystery has stumped many before him. Woodrow said 
gripes about smelly toilets have been common since the first outhouse was 
installed in a national forest in the early 1900s, and today's visitors are 
even less tolerant -- and more vocal -- than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
But the Forest Service has been unable to conquer the problem, despite 
experiments with chemicals, waste-eating organisms, flushable models and a 
variety of ventilation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, most officials have reached a common conclusion: "We figured that 
toilets stink, period. Take it or leave it," said Woodrow, who said his own 
wife has growled about the malodorous facilities during family vacations in the 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, however, is one of those never-say-die kind of fellows, and so he kept at 
the toilet problem -- even when supervisors advised otherwise. The engineer -- 
whose silver hair and wire-rimmed glasses are reminiscent of a high school 
biology teacher -- even built an experimental toilet in his laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cook made a startling discovery: While examining a toilet in a 
Florida national forest, he found that cobwebs had clogged the compartment's 
vent stack, preventing air -- and thus odors -- from escaping. A survey of 
toilet stacks in other forests revealed they, too, suffered from the spider web 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
While the find sounds elementary, like something a custodian should have 
figured out years ago, Cook noted: "Nobody likes these little cabanas, so why 
would they go crawling around inside them? It's in and out, as fast as 
possible. Nobody ever bothered to look in that stack." 
</P>
<P>
Other finds soon followed. Key among these was Cook's discovery that the 
toilets' basic design prevents effective ventilation. Through tests in an 
experimental wind tunnel, Cook determined that a wider vent stack stretching 
much higher above the roof line vastly improves the expulsion of odors. Also, 
he found, solar-powered fans help further to pull the fetid air from the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to the San Bernardino National Forest, Cook stood before 
a sorry looking privy at the Thurman Flats picnic area and talked about the 
state-of-the-art toilet of tomorrow. With obvious pride, he pointed to a 
vandal-proof toilet paper dispenser he designed in 1974, and revealed 
structural defects that still make this particular outhouse a stinker. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, Forest Service janitor Philip La Voie, happened by. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a very important job," Cook told the man, "and soon you won't have to 
put up with any more odors when you clean the toilets." 
</P>
<P>
La Voie wanted to hear more, so Cook launched into a detailed description of 
the recent technological advancements. He soon had his colleague shaking his 
head in awe. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds great," said La Voie. "I like my job, but I sure don't look forward to 
cleaning these things." 
</P>
<P>
Cook hopes ultimately to share his design with the National Park Service, the 
Army Corps of Engineers and other public lands managers, all of whom are 
plagued with smelly toilets.

WEAK RESOLVE ON QUAKE STUDIES LEAVES STATE IN THE LURCH

<P>
Japan has set the standard for earthquake preparations with a comprehensive 
program that even includes an effort to predict a specific temblor in time to 
evacuate several crowded cities before a catastrophic quake hits. 
</P>
<P>
Even in California, which will unquestionably be hit by a monster quake 
sometime within the next few decades, there is nothing else quite like it. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
One obvious reason is that Japan has many more earthquakes than California and 
thus is more frequently reminded of the threat, but the problem goes much 
deeper than that. What is lacking in California, according to scores of 
seismologists interviewed over many years, is a clear resolve on the part of 
the public, plus an acceptable level of commitment from government agencies 
that fund the research. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that California will be struck by many earthquakes in the 
years ahead, researchers have to fight for every nickel that goes into the 
earth sciences, perhaps because they seem less glamorous than some other fields 
of science. 
</P>
<P>
One does not have to look far for an example. It took scientists at the 
California Institute of Technology years to muster the economic backing to 
create a modest network of seismographic stations that will study earthquakes 
in Southern California, although the program costs only one three-hundredth as 
much as the giant atom smasher that the federal government plans to build in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
When a magnitude 7.1 quake devastated parts of the San Francisco Bay Area last 
October, a golden opportunity to learn more about the dynamics of temblors on 
the mighty San Andreas Fault slipped through the fingers of scientists, who 
felt frustrated by the lack of support for their research. That quake, which 
destroyed homes and collapsed a freeway more than 50 miles away from the 
epicenter, came as no surprise to scientists who have studied the San Andreas. 
In fact, it hit on the segment of the great fault that had been singled out as 
the most likely area in all of Northern California for a major quake on the San 
Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there were relatively few instruments operating in the Santa Cruz Mountains 
around the fault when the quake struck. Had the area been as heavily 
instrumented as Japan's Tokai area -- where Japanese scientists hope to predict 
a coming quake -- enough data would have been collected to rewrite the 
textbooks on seismology and the San Andreas, and it may have provided some 
warning. Instead, scientists had to admit with some embarrassment that they 
were unable to detect any sign that the approaching quake was imminent, despite 
the fact that they had every reason to believe it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that very troubling," one key scientist said as he reviewed the scant 
data collected from the October quake. 
</P>
<P>
To that must be added the fact that relatively little is known about past 
quakes in California, partly because recorded history here is so brief compared 
to Japan's. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one place in California where earthquakes occur with such 
consistency that scientists can say with confidence that one is due there now. 
That is near the Central California community of Parkfield, northeast of Paso 
Robles, where the San Andreas breaks about every 22 years. The record of 
periodicity there is so clear that Parkfield today is one of the most heavily 
instrumented areas in the world, and scientists hope to learn much about 
precisely what happens before, during and after an earthquake on the San 
Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
However, scientists have searched far and wide for another Parkfield, because 
what happens in one spot may be quite different from what happens someplace 
else. As of today, however, no one knows for sure where the next earthquake is 
most likely to strike, with the single exception of Parkfield. 
</P>
<P>
And Parkfield is so isolated that even if scientists were able to predict the 
exact moment a quake is most likely to strike, there would be no more than a 
handful of people to evacuate. Meanwhile, a great quake could hit in downtown 
Los Angeles with no warning whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
So despite the fact that scientists agree that a catastrophic quake lurks in 
California's future, there is very little effort to predict it because no one 
knows where it will hit. 
</P>
<P>
The experts could get lucky, of course, and the quake could tip its hand in 
advance through such things as very convincing foreshocks or swarms of smaller 
quakes, but the understanding of earthquakes in California is so incomplete 
that it will take a bold soul indeed to say with conviction that a specific 
quake is about to strike. 
</P>
<P>
So as it stands now, California will muddle on with very limited funding, 
hoping that bright men and women who struggle against profound odds to 
understand forces that could level great cities will somehow unravel the 
mysteries in time to save a few thousand lives. Maybe they will. But maybe they 
won't.

19-YEAR DEBATE OVER 'STONE AGE' TASADAY THRIVES IN RAIN FOREST; 
</P>
<P>
ANTHROPOLOGY: SCIENTISTS REMAIN DIVIDED OVER THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE 
CAVE-DWELLING TRIBE. NOW UPHEAVAL IN THE PHILIPPINES THREATENS TO OBSCURE THE 
TRUTH EVEN FURTHER.

They call it the rain-forest Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most confusing and contentious debates in modern anthropology 
concerns a group of 70 people living in a mountainous rain forest on Mindanao, 
the second-largest island in the Philippines. The people are known as the 
Tasaday, and their story is a volatile blend of science, politics and the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1971, the Tasaday were heralded as the most primitive people on Earth, 
living a virtually Stone Age life. National Geographic ran a cover story on the 
26 Tasaday individuals observed crouching in two caves, wearing orchid-leaf 
coverings, using stone and bamboo tools, and eating wild roots, bananas, 
berries, grubs, and crabs and frogs scooped by hand from nearby streams. They 
had no pottery, no woven cloth, no metal, no art, no weapons, no domestic 
plants or animals -- in sum, no apparent knowledge of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the Tasaday's pristine reputation was abruptly blasted out of the 
water. A Swiss journalist, soon to be followed by two German reporters, trekked 
to the tribe's mountain caves. After interviewing several Tasaday and observing 
their colored T-shirts, wooden beds and metal knives, the journalists 
pronounced them a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
They reported that several Tasaday confessed to being members of two nearby 
farming tribes and had been coerced to act like Stone Age survivors by Manuel 
Elizalde Jr., who in the early 1970s served Philippine President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos as head of a government agency charged with protecting the rights of 
minority groups. The scheme, according to the European reports and later 
television documentaries in the United States and England, was hatched to make 
Marcos look like a friend of Philippine tribes while he arranged to exploit 
valuable mahogany stands on their preserves. 
</P>
<P>
Several anthropologists then joined the fray, charging that the Tasaday are 
bogus and the scientists who studied them in 1972 were duped by Elizalde. 
</P>
<P>
The original investigators of the Tasaday unanimously responded that the cave 
dwellers are a distinct tribe, although not relics of the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing for certain at this point is that the scientific data on the 
Tasaday are preliminary and even new investigations may not lead to a consensus 
about their origins. 
</P>
<P>
For example, anthropologist and long-time Tasaday skeptic Zeus Salazar of the 
University of the Philippines interviewed several Tasaday informants and in 
1988 presented several genealogies, or family histories, showing that 16 of the 
Tasaday studied in 1972 were actually members of the nearby T'boli and Blit 
Manubo tribes. 
</P>
<P>
But another genealogical study, described at a November, 1989, meeting of the 
American Anthropological Assn., indicates the Tasaday are for real and have 
inhabited their portion of the Mindanao mountains for at least seven 
generations, or approximately 200 years. Ethnographer Amelia Rogel-Rara of the 
Tasaday Community Care Foundation in Manila and her co-workers interviewed all 
70 Tasaday now living in the rain forest, as well as about 40 of their friends 
and relatives living elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar remains skeptical and says Rogel-Rara's work must be examined closely 
before winning scientific acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar also charges that the Tasaday language contains agricultural terms for 
planting and harvesting, activities they supposedly did not practice. 
Journalists who talked with Tasaday informants say they spoke the languages of 
nearby T'boli and Manubo farmers. 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest evidence of the authenticity of the Tasaday lies in their 
speech, responds linguist Carol Molony of Stanford University, who visited the 
tribe for 14 days in 1972. Molony tape-recorded Tasaday conversations and 
developed an 800-word vocabulary list from their language. Tasaday is a dialect 
of other Manubo languages in the Philippines, she maintains. Many Tasaday words 
share common origins with words used by nearby farming tribes, but there are 
important differences, in Molony's view. For instance, the Tasaday's nearest 
neighbors use words of Sanskrit, Chinese, Spanish and English ancestry; no 
similar linguistic influences appear in the Tasaday tongue. 
</P>
<P>
T'boli and Manubo actors could not banish these telltale terms from their 
speech, Molony argues. 
</P>
<P>
Linguist Lawrence A. Reid of the University of Hawaii at Manoa examined 
Molony's work and that of other language specialists who visited the Tasaday, 
and he agrees that they speak a Manubo dialect. The Tasaday probably belonged 
to a larger Manubo community around 150 years ago, Reid says, and, for some 
reason, retreated into the forest where their dialect has since developed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet linguists Cesar and Araceli Hidalgo of the University of Malaya in Kuala 
Lumpur hiked up to the Tasaday caves last August and concluded the tribe speaks 
a language distinct from the Manubo dialects of nearby farmers. They agree with 
Molony and Reid, however, that the Tasaday are not a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Another critical question, notes anthropologist Thomas N. Headland of the 
Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, involves what the Tasaday ate prior 
to their introduction to scientists in 1972. Based on his own fieldwork with a 
hunter-gatherer group on the Philippine island of Luzon, Headland says a rain 
forest does not contain enough wild starch foods, such as yams, to sustain 
human life. The Tasaday, like the Luzon tribe, must have traded forest products 
for starches cultivated by farmers within a three-hour walk of their caves, he 
contends. Headland doubts the Tasaday were isolated in the forest for more than 
a century, as some of the linguistic data suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnobotanist Douglas E. Yen of Australia National University in Canberra 
disagrees. Yen spent 38 days with the Tasaday in 1972 studying their diet. The 
forest provided enough food of sufficient variety to subsist on, he says. Some 
Tasaday went on hunting and gathering trips for a week or more, Yen notes. They 
returned with small bundles of meat, and probably ate larger quantities at 
animal kill sites, a common practice among other hunter-gatherers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1972 the Tasaday were receiving government rice supplements, Yen says, and 
with worldwide publicity came the rapid introduction of agricultural practices 
and other outside influences. "We may have seen the last of the original 
Tasaday in 1972," he asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Yen suspects the Tasaday were farmers sometime within the past few centuries 
and fled to the mountains to escape one of the Philippines' many political 
upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
Tasaday doubters, such as Gerald Berreman of UC Berkeley, maintain there is 
plenty of evidence suggesting the tribe is phony and probably an invention of 
Elizalde. "This is a rain-forest Watergate," Berreman says. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific investigations in the early 1970s were tightly controlled by 
Elizalde and lasted only about three hours per day, after which visitors were 
flown out by helicopter, he points out. Impostors could easily have snuck back 
to their home villages at night and returned early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Berreman also charges that Tasaday stone tools were crude, virtually unusable 
and obvious fakes. Furthermore, there is no evidence of nearby forest-dwelling 
tribes that allegedly intermarried with the Tasaday and would have been 
critical to the reproductive success of such a small group. Perhaps most 
telling, Berreman adds, is the lack of any reports of debris in the Tasaday 
caves, a sure sign of human occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Yen and John Nance, a Portland, Ore., journalist who has visited the Tasaday 
many times and staunchly defends their authenticity, say there were refuse 
piles in the Tasaday caves down a hillside from the caves in 1972, but an 
archeological study of the remains was not conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Such a study may not be performed in the near future, either. The Philippines' 
political situation is unstable, and scientists in search of the Tasaday face 
potentially life-threatening encounters. Marxist guerrillas, disaffected 
soldiers from the Marcos regime and armed tribal groups all operate out of the 
Mindanao rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Political pressures also fuel the hoax charges, according to Tasaday 
supporters. If the Philippine government proclaims the Tasaday to be impostors, 
their 46,300-acre forest preserve -- established by Marcos in 1973 -- would be 
taken away. It then would become fair game for logging companies, miners of 
silver and other valuable metals and developers desperate for land amid a 
burgeoning population crunch on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
For now, both the Tasaday preserve and the rancorous scientific debate over 
their origins remain intact. A panel convened by the American Anthropological 
Assn. will soon review evidence on the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a competent archeologist a matter of hours to examine the 
Tasaday caves and determine whether they had been inhabited for days or for 
generations," says William Longacre of the University of Arizona in Tucson. But 
given the combative scientific and political context, "I wouldn't touch that 
study with a 10-foot pole," Longacre adds.

HUMAN MEDICINE NOW BENEFITS ANIMALS; 
</P>
<P>
VETERINARIANS: TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED FOR HUMANS ARE NOW COMMONLY USED TO HEAL 
AILING ANIMALS. APPLICATIONS INCLUDE KIDNEY DIALYSIS AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Last spring, Abracadabra, a 3-day-old foal with kidney failure, was rushed to 
the equine neonatal intensive care unit at UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching 
Hospital. His condition worsened in the next few hours, as the antibiotics that 
veterinarian Sally Vivrette gave him had no effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you a gambler?" she asked the foal's owner, Michael Hastings. The only 
solution remaining to Abracadabra, she explained, was risky: hooking him up to 
a dialysis machine once used to treat humans with chronic kidney disease. It 
had never been tried on a foal. 
</P>
<P>
Dialysis, developed by doing research on dogs and goats for application in 
humans, has over the last several years come full circle to benefit animals. 
Vivrette sought out UC Davis veterinarian Larry Cowgill, a pioneer in using the 
procedure on cats and dogs suffering from acute kidney failure. She proposed 
that he add horses to the list. 
</P>
<P>
Cowgill agreed, as did Hastings. Abracadabra was anesthetized and a surgical 
team installed a shunt to divert the blood entering the foal's kidneys into the 
dialysis machine, which removes waste products the kidneys ordinarily transform 
into urine. Over the next five days, Abracadabra was hooked up to the machine 
for three six-hour sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The process worked. The dialysis gave the foal's kidneys a chance to rest, fend 
off the infection with the help of the antibiotics and repair themselves. A few 
days later, the surgeons removed the shunt. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Hastings said, Abracadabra, is "doing stupendously. He's fully recovered 
and growing like a weed." He has only one holdover from the days he spent at 
the neonatal unit: He likes to lie down and cradle his head in Hastings' lap, 
as he did with the veterinarians while he was sick. 
</P>
<P>
"He was spoiled rotten when he was here," Cowgill said. 
</P>
<P>
Many animals now benefit from procedures commonly used on humans. Dogs have 
hips and knees replaced. Horses have arthroscopy to remove bone chips around 
tendons. Cats have kidney transplants. Dogs receive heart pacemakers. 
Chemotherapy is done on animals, as are human emergency room techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of physicians dealing with premature and sick human babies have 
been transferred to neonatal intensive care units in veterinary schools and 
zoos. The tiny panda cub that recently died at the National Zoo was cared for 
in an intensive care unit, and physicians from Children's Hospital in 
Washington, D.C., were consulted. Non-invasive procedures -- ultrasound, CAT 
scans, echo-cardiography and nuclear magnetic resonance -- developed and 
refined in humans are now used by veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of research on animals directly benefits animals," says Anne Koterba, 
assistant professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of 
Florida in Gainesville, and director of the school's equine neonatal intensive 
care unit. 
</P>
<P>
One startling example is a discovery UC Davis veterinarian Paul Pion made while 
doing research on tissue plasminogen activator -- TPA -- used to dissolve blood 
clots that cause heart attacks in humans. One cat on which he tested TPA to 
dissolve its blood clots had a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
"His heart was a big, flabby muscle," Pion said. "It was a very common disease, 
and cats who got it would routinely die." At that time, veterinarians thought 
that cats suffered from the disease because they were not fed correctly by 
their owners. But the owner of this cat knew he had a nutritional deficiency, 
because the cat's veterinarian had found lesions in its eyes, which indicated a 
lack of taurine, an essential amino acid for cats. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to investigate the relationship between the two," Pion said. He 
found that the taurine deficiency caused the disease. Pet food manufacturers, 
who thought they had enough taurine in their products, have added more since 
August, 1987. Since then, Pion said, the disease has decreased dramatically. 
"In one fell swoop I prevented disease in more animals than I could in a 
lifetime of treating animals individually," Pion said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most interesting applications of human medicine to veterinary 
medicine are the dozen equine neonatal units that have sprung up around the 
country since the first one was founded at the University of Florida in 1982. 
"We didn't know much about foals," said Koterba, who now handles 45 to 55 foals 
a year. "We treated them like adult (horses), and it didn't work well." 
</P>
<P>
Like human babies, baby horses differ physiologically from adults, and require 
different treatment -- so much so that when UC Davis veterinarian John Madigan 
wanted to set up an equine neonatal intensive care unit, he talked to Boyd 
Goetzman. The professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of neonatology 
at UC Davis Medical Center had written a how-to manual for neonatal intensive 
care units for human babies; he helped Madigan write a similar manual for 
foals. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that economics drives the transfer of medical technology from 
humans to animals, Koterba said. "In the late 1970s, prices of thoroughbred 
horses went skyrocketing. Sick foals were hitting the ground with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars invested in them. To just let them die was not a very good 
idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic value attached to zoo animals, farm animals, endangered species 
and research animals has justified money spent to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
But economics is not always the motivation behind a human wanting to keep an 
animal alive. Last year, Karen Ustin, a nightclub owner from Danville, Calif., 
spent $1,500 for a kidney transplant for her cat, Cyrano, an ordinary gray and 
white short-haired cat that had lived with her for 12 years. The 
immunosuppressant drugs that prevent rejection of transplanted organs were 
developed by doing research on dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Because the drugs are relatively inexpensive, and now in good supply because of 
their use on humans, a kidney transplant was done for Cyrano. His post-surgical 
treatment was determined by the experience accumulated on humans, said UC Davis 
veterinarian Clare Gregory, who performed the transplant. "How I follow the 
progress of cats is based on work done on people in the last 20 years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cyrano died last month of intestinal cancer, a year after receiving his new 
kidney. The cat's last year of life was like his other 12, Ustin said, except 
that he had to take pills twice a day. "That extra year, he had good quality of 
life," said Ustin, who has no regrets about doing the transplant. "I couldn't 
just watch him suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Abracadabra, although he will likely be trained in dressage, exhibition riding, 
will not produce any income for Hastings, who earns his living in real estate. 
But future income was never the reason he spent $3,000 on the dialysis 
treatment, he said. "I have a very strong feeling that if you bring an animal 
into the world, that it is your responsibility."

A murder suspect was killed in a shoot-out with police in a Wilmington 
neighborhood after he shouted, "If you want me, come and get me," authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No officers were injured in the shooting, which occurred as officers chased the 
suspect through back yards and into the 1500 block of East Cruces Street about 
7 p.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Kathleen Murcott. 
</P>
<P>
The murder suspect, a 23-year-old man, was not identified pending notification 
of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was wanted in the Aug. 13 shooting death of Lanny Tapp during an 
argument that took place a few blocks from Saturday's gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they learned of the suspect's whereabouts Saturday from a resident 
in the Wilmington neighborhood. Five officers went to Cruces Street, where 
another resident pointed out the suspect and said he was carrying a gun, 
Murcott said. 
</P>
<P>
A chase ensued, with the suspect ending up in front of a Cruces Street 
residence, where Officers Michael Marco, 42, and Matthew Spillane, 24, were 
waiting, Murcott said. 
</P>
<P>
When the suspect saw the officers, he pointed a gun and said, "If you want me, 
come and get me," and began firing shots at them, Murcott said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers fired a total of 12 rounds at the suspect, who then collapsed 
in the street, she said. He died about 30 minutes later at St. Mary Medical 
Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol at the shooting scene.

ANTI-ABORTION PROTESTERS DECRY HOLDS APPLIED BY OFFICERS DURING ARRESTS. THEIR 
STAND HAS TURNED LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE ALLIANCES TOPSY-TURVY. 
</P>

<P>
A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los 
Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they 
are arresting. 
</P>
<P>
They press fingers under their noses. They dig their knuckles into protesters' 
necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists. At one point, two 
officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched 
in agony. In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along. His 
arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps. 
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement name for these techniques is "pain-compliance." Police 
departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative 
protesters cooperate. But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders 
launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago. This time, 
however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes 
from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see 
themselves as law-and-order conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy. 
Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as 
conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion 
Republicans are voicing the sort of "police state" rhetoric once associated 
with anti-war radicals. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting 
nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican 
senator, decried pain-compliance as "something we expect to hear about in 
Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with 
little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain 
federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion 
cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- 
has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance 
to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it. 
</P>
<P>
Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are 
howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than 
$50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's utter stupidity," Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said. 
"Utter, complete stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term 
pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used "in civil rights 
demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all 
through the '60s, all through the '70s," Gates said. He smiled. "You didn't 
hear any Republicans complain then, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy 
about "chokeholds" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening 
situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that "come-along" 
techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest 
nonviolent demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed 
with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, 
dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or 
grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's 
hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: 
"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of 
synapses whether "reasonable force" included opening fire with her handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in 
confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt. Fred Nichols, the academy's 
expert on the use of force. The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- 
"Would you do this?" Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk 
but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most simple "come-along" compliance techniques are twist- and 
wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft 
tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said. Another trick of the trade: 
the "mastoid lift," in which officers press the nerves along each side of the 
neck. Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the 
Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly. 
</P>
<P>
But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience 
technique and "go limp" when asked to move, others link arms. They become 
"human worm-balls" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance 
techniques ineffective, officers say. Trying to carry away protesters in these 
cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say. 
</P>
<P>
So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange 
County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts 
tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a "police control device" -- consisting of 
two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon. 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a 
cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a "trap-and-wrap" maneuver. 
The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or 
compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa. Protesters are given 
every chance to move on their own. Police actually plead with Operation Rescue 
demonstrators in some cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then "they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain. It's a pain 
control technique," he said. "It's going to hurt. That's what pain-compliance 
means." 
</P>
<P>
But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more 
conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but 
lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting 
nerve damage. As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los 
Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground," Nichols 
said. "With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark. It's kind 
of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking. 
You say, something's wrong here." 
</P>
<P>
In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt. Patrick E. McKinley of 
LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary 
Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against 
everything from apartheid to animal rights. Operation Rescue protesters stand 
out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take 
action against abortion," he said in a sworn statement last August, given as 
part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle 
relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue 
spokeswoman called "100% incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley. "I'm no doctor. But 
pain has a purpose. It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing. If you 
don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue 
protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic 
</P>
<P>
convention in Atlanta. As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil 
disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality 
increased: 
</P>
<P>
* In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: 
"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em." 
</P>
<P>
* In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers. 
</P>
<P>
* In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- 
purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled 
protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic 
handcuffs, or with "crotch carries" in which a night stick is stuck between the 
protester's legs. A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting 
pain: "The demonic element entered in here." 
</P>
<P>
A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: "By the time they got my arms 
all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . . 'Jesus! 
Jesus!' " 
</P>
<P>
In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and 
Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds 
after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a 
form of "curbside justice." 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed 
by kindred spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were 
calling the police pigs, being belligerent," said Dan Bruno, an accountant for 
the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles 
demonstration. "Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life. I've never been 
roughed up like that before. Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was 
like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police. Rather, 
leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt 
they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file 
complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the 
Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A group called 
Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed "real 
atrocities" by the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint. For example, feminist 
lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she 
believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings 
and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't have much sympathy for them," she said of the anti-abortion 
"rescuers," as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice "clinic 
defenders" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton. 
"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous. 
What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to 
what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well 
have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police 
twist protesters' arms and chanted: "L.A. blue, we're with you." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found 
support. "I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the 
Christians to the lions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many 
think in the debate over police uses of force. 
</P>
<P>
Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for 
letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' 
fight to restrain what he calls "the torture police." He also has charged that 
his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: "We like to value tolerance. But 
you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you 
care about. This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not 
as tolerant as we pretend to be." 
</P>
<P>
At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in 
September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class 
of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a 
crime," he said. "All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're 
taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest. I don't want them 
concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. 
Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing 
legislation to restrain them. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column 
by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil 
rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: "It is hard to believe that 
Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the 
treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their 
treatment of members of Operation Rescue." 
</P>
<P>
An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and 
tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community 
Planning and Development grants may be paid "to any municipality that fails to 
adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law 
enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any 
individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into 
doing what the federal government wants it to do," said Gates. "Now we've got 
Republicans doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates 
pointed out. But if this "horrendous" new measure has its intended effect, 
eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, 
his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe 
take over any facility they choose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares 
Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative 
lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any 
nonviolent demonstrator is often "barbaric," and she supports restraints on the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel was "amused" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police 
brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. 
policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other 
groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she believes the new measure will help assure "that the cost of 
demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate. I just hope conservatives remember 
that it includes everyone."

WORKERS CALL TENTS, CAVES HOME IN HIGH-RENT ASPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ASPEN, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the evening, as the vacationing skiers descend from the slopes and head back 
to their luxury hotels and chalets, as the shoppers leave the expensive 
boutiques, construction worker Tim Travelsted finishes his day among the 
million-dollar condos here and heads "down valley" to Glenwood Springs, a 
40-mile drive to the cave that he calls home. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Travelsted's cave, down by the Colorado River, Skip Merlo, 30, 
will be hunkering down for the evening in a makeshift plastic lean-to. Two 
sleeping bags protect him from the bitter cold. He spends his days working in 
Aspen, too. This is the only home he can find. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Aspen, while the well-to-do make small talk over cappuccino and 
cognac, the bartenders, cooks, dishwashers, waiters and housekeepers who serve 
them are hustling to earn $7, $8, sometimes $12 an hour. After they finish 
work, a number of them will spend the night in their cars. Others will bed down 
in a railroad boxcar, a vacant building or an abandoned mine shaft. Some will 
curl up in doorways. They have nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Charles Dickens' 'Tale of Two Cities,' " said Jim Adamski, housing 
director for Aspen and surrounding Pitkin County. "It isn't the best of times 
for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Aspen, tucked high up in the Elk Range of the Rockies, is a place where the 
rich and famous come to live and play, where there are jobs galore and where 
"on any given night, you can go out and find people living in cars, tents and 
boxes," said Dan Arrow, an Aspen businessman and member of a nonprofit 
organization working to find and build housing for people such as Travelsted 
and Merlo. 
</P>
<P>
In urban areas across America, homelessness has long been a fact of life, but 
it is a relatively new and unsettling phenomenon in this affluent rural 
setting. Unlike those in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, Seattle and Chicago, 
few of the homeless here are transient, alcoholic, addicted to drugs or 
mentally ill. They are workers earning what in most places would be considered 
decent wages. 
</P>
<P>
There are few homes to be found here. Aspen has a near-zero vacancy rate, and 
few working people can afford what space there is. Two bedrooms rent for $2,000 
a month, one bedroom for $1,000. Even the town's "affordable" public housing is 
not affordable for some at $750 a month for a two-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, workers looking for a place to live drive down Roaring Fork 
Valley to towns such as Basalt, Carbondale, El Jebel, Glenwood Springs, Rifle, 
Silt and even as far as Grand Junction, 60 miles away. But the housing shortage 
in Aspen, which offers most of the jobs in the area, has had a ripple effect, 
driving up prices in those towns as well and leaving few vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Lived in Car 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Walker, 30, spent four months living in her car with her children, ages 
6 and 8, when she moved to Glenwood Springs from Grand Junction in search of 
work. Like many others who have moved to the area, she found a job the first 
day, but found she couldn't afford to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kerchner, 20, who works in Aspen and Glenwood Springs, spent two years 
moving from place to place in Glenwood Springs before she landed an apartment 
she could afford. First she moved in with a couple in a one-bedroom apartment. 
The number of occupants expanded to four, then to six as others arrived looking 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she shared a two-bedroom apartment with another couple, but those 
numbers quickly grew to four, then six and finally to eight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to find work," Kerchner said, "but it's hard as hell to find 
somewhere to live." 
</P>
<P>
For years, housing has been a problem in this town of 6,000 people. Michael 
Schultz, Aspen's director of social services, recalls how he almost passed up 
his current position 10 years ago because he had trouble finding a place to 
stay. Gary Peters, a city councilman and a resident for 17 years, lived for 
years in an unheated cabin without running water, partly because it fit the 
Aspen mystique, but largely because it was so difficult to find housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd see the day when there would be homelessness in Aspen," 
Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness comes as a rude awakening to image-conscious Aspen. The community 
has long prided itself on being all things to all people, a place where the 
rich and the not-so-rich, joined by a common independent spirit, reveled 
together in the beauties of nature. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to think we're slick and special in Aspen," said Michael Gassman, 
another city councilman, "but we're not immune to the other things that are 
happening in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Aspen's problem, however, may be unique. Although unemployment is a major cause 
of homelessness in other cities, there is work for everybody here. Yet to make 
$6 an hour in Aspen is to be considered most definitely poor. Nearly half of 
those who work in town must live elsewhere, and 20% of all employed Aspen 
residents live in city-supervised housing. 
</P>
<P>
Even professionals such as dentists and architects may find themselves cast 
adrift as their rental housing is sold out from under them or their leases 
expire just in time for the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the neighborhoods of the rich provide jobs for workers who live 
elsewhere; in Aspen, "elsewhere" often is another town miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers must commute 90 minutes daily on a dangerous stretch of two-lane 
highway dubbed "Killer 82" to attend to the whims of Aspen's visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness came to Aspen through a combination of greed, glut and 
well-meaning efforts to keep development under control. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the city adopted several slow-growth ordinances aimed at holding 
down density and preserving the community's small-town flavor. The move 
backfired. Property prices rose quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Then Aspen became a darling of the wealthy ski set. 
</P>
<P>
The town's tax rolls read like a prologue to "Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous." Property owners include tennis star Martina Navratilova, actor Jack 
Nicholson (who has an in-town Victorian and a lavish retreat beside Castle 
Creek), business tycoon Donald Trump and television's Barbara Walters. Actress 
Jill St. John has lived here 18 years. George Hamilton supplements his acting 
income by refurbishing and selling Victorian houses. Other famous Aspenites 
include comedienne Goldie Hawn, actor Kurt Russell and rock star Don Henley (at 
whose 1986 New Year's Eve party then-Sen. Gary Hart made the costly 
acquaintance of Donna Rice), slugger Reggie Jackson, Beach Boy Brian Wilson and 
Texas financier Sid Bass (whose dance floor hides an indoor swimming pool). Don 
Johnson and Melanie Griffith play here with baby daughter Dakota, and magazine 
publisher William Ziff had a "lake custom" home built at 9,500 feet above sea 
level. 
</P>
<P>
To make way for this new elite, apartment houses and duplexes that were 
year-round residences came down and were replaced by expensive vacation homes 
and condominiums for out-of-towners and real estate speculators. 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices shot through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Aspen Mayor Bill Stirling needs only to look out the window of his real estate 
office to see the crux of the problem: In a 2-block area just a stone's throw 
away, six new condominium units, priced at $2.5 million each, have replaced an 
apartment complex that once housed 40 moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is, we've got six second homes (instead)," Stirling said with a 
sigh. "The people who once lived here have now moved down valley, and they're 
on Highway 82 commuting to work every day." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the other towns along the highway are booming as old time 
Aspenites are pushed out and workers drawn to one of the few places in Colorado 
where there are jobs trickle in. In Basalt, housing starts in 1988 were up 53% 
over the 1987 rate, while in Carbondale, the rate of new construction rose 
200%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Towns Pressured 
</P>
<P>
And growth brings attendant problems. City officials in towns such as Glenwood 
Springs and Rifle say that all the new people have increased demand for roads, 
schools, law enforcement, child care and other services. Employees, however, 
are hard to find and even harder to keep because the pay is always better in 
Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have accused the Aspen city fathers of sticking their heads in the sand 
and allowing the housing situation to deteriorate to the point of widespread 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Stirling agrees with that assessment. "We just weren't paying 
attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, the critics charge, since it has become difficult for local 
businesses to keep their employees, has the city taken hold of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become an economic problem, not a humanitarian problem," Arrow said. "If 
the rest of the nation knew about this it would be an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
Many professionals are beginning to abandon Aspen because of the housing 
shortage. Annette Carlozzi resigned as director of the city's art museum this 
year, largely because of the housing crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a wonderful offer to be executive director of the Contemporary Art 
Center in New Orleans . . . the same week we lost our housing," she said. "I 
have always gotten lots of offers. I usually wasn't interested." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Haddad, a business teacher at Aspen High School, recently found a 
one-bedroom apartment, but when the owner returns in June she will have to move 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"The day I move down valley is the day I leave Aspen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aspen bus company has postponed extending service to the airport because it 
is short 14 drivers. Even the White River Forest Service has jobs that go 
begging because the housing shortage makes positions here unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
The city has imposed a moratorium on demolition, and a new ordinance requires 
that any new business must provide housing for at least 60% of its employees or 
pay the city $30,000 per worker for housing construction. Aspen is completing 
work on 46 units of year-round housing and 100 units for seasonal workers. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes eventually to see a vacancy rate of at least 10%, and to see 70% 
of those who work in town also housed in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of the problem, city officials said, is that many workers simply 
are not paid enough to live in a town where the middle income is $80,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in this wonderful resort community who have made all this money 
should share the wealth and start paying better wages," Adamski of the Housing 
Authority said. "What we're doing (with public housing) is subsidizing low 
wages." 
</P>
<P>
Public housing plans have met with resistance. While the voters have approved 
tax increases for such projects, nobody wants such facilities, no matter how 
nice, to go up next door to his million-dollar home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the NIMBY syndrome," Stirling said. " 'Not In My Back Yard.' Aspen used 
to be a place where the rich rubbed elbows with the poor constantly. Now, it's 
like prerevolutionary France. It's more of a gatehouse community." 
</P>
<P>
Many workers here agree. "You get the message that they don't mind if you work 
there, but if you don't have money they don't want you to live there," said 
Hope Reed, 34, who works in Aspen and lives in Glenwood Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the city's public housing, some workers say, is not really designed for 
them. Working people who stand in line six deep for every available unit find 
themselves competing with dentists, lawyers and other professionals because the 
guidelines for occupancy allow income levels up to $49,500. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Glenwood Springs, Rifle and Silt who work in Aspen also eye with 
caution efforts to widen Highway 82 to four lanes. While they agree that it 
would make commuting easier and less dangerous, some speculate that Aspen's 
desire to have the project completed is part of an effort to keep them living 
"down valley." 
</P>
<P>
But many townspeople have come to believe that ending a housing crunch that 
puts workers on the street is essential. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a long time to come around," said Gassman, the councilman. ". . . 
But you say, 'What are you preserving if you lose the community?' " 
</P>
<P>
Spence Videon, president of the Aspen Chamber Resort Assn., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a community where there are no children because homes are owned by 
outsiders is not the kind of community I think people want to live in," Videon 
said. "Maybe that's OK with the glitter-and-glitz crowd, but I sense that most 
of the people in Aspen don't want to have that cold, exclusive environment that 
doesn't have laughing children."

GORBACHEV ENTERING MOST PERILOUS TIME OF HIS RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is entering the most dangerous period of his 
five years of leadership of the Soviet Union -- a time in which the future of 
his political and economic reforms and his own fate could be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few weeks, Gorbachev must deal decisively with the country's severe 
economic problems, the potentially explosive nationalism in most of its 
constituent republics and the sharp political divisions, even within the top 
ranks of the ruling Communist Party, on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's advisers speak frankly of a serious "multi-dimensional crisis" in 
the country and say they anticipate "a very rough struggle" in coming months, 
particularly in the regional and local elections scheduled for February and 
March and the preparations for a party congress later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet journalists are now writing speculatively but openly of scenarios 
that could lead to a conservative coup d'etat removing Gorbachev, the breakup 
of the Soviet Union through ethnic clashes or a civil war that might break out 
between those trying to preserve socialism and those trying to replace it with 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent opinion polls show not just increasing disenchantment with 
perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, but even willingness by more 
than half those surveyed to return to more conservative rule if it meant more 
food in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real threat to Mikhail Gorbachev, a real danger for perestroika," a 
senior Communist Party official commented. "We need to go ahead faster, we need 
to do more, but we must take the people with us -- and they are not ready." The 
official continued: 
</P>
<P>
"In the mass consciousness, there is a feeling that it was a great mistake to 
emphasize political reforms rather than economic restructuring at the outset. 
People do not accept that truly revolutionary structural changes were needed 
first for economic gains later. We dare not widen this gap between the people 
and the party too much." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the party's policy-making Central Committee, also speaking 
privately, said: "Everything is at stake. We must navigate boldly to get out of 
this crisis, but also very carefully, for we have almost no margin for error." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis facing Gorbachev is really a series of interconnected political and 
economic crises, each having an impact on the others and none capable of 
resolution without progress on the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If our economic problems were not so acute, I doubt that we would be facing 
the nationalist unrest that we have today," said a top Soviet editor, himself a 
member of the party hierarchy. "But people are hungry, and hunger makes people 
angry. If we had real political resolve, then we could have moved forward on 
those issues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The knot of problems has grown tighter and tighter. There is a great 
temptation just to slice through it, but Mikhail Gorbachev's patient untying of 
it is probably better." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, to be sure, has dealt with successive crises over the last five 
years, reducing the immediate danger to his leadership and to the reform 
program, removing many of his opponents and always broadening and extending 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
What worries many now is the complex nature of the crisis -- and the much 
reduced time that Gorbachev has to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
The country's top economists warned six months ago that the Soviet leader had a 
year to a year and a half, at most, to demonstrate to the country that the 
reforms are resolving problems, not creating more, and that they are improving 
living standards, not diminishing them. These economists include Vice Premier 
Leonid I. Abalkin and Prof. Nikolai Y. Petrakov, the new economic adviser on 
Gorbachev's personal staff. 
</P>
<P>
The government's new economic program, designed by Abalkin, is expected to 
begin to show results in better supplies of consumer goods and food -- but only 
in the second half of the year -- and thus to intensify political pressure on 
Gorbachev to deal effectively with other problems to buy this additional time. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a period of even greater uncertainty than we have known in the 
past two or three years," a prominent political commentator remarked, "and this 
has the effect of heightening social tensions, which are already acute, and 
increasing the mood of crisis. More than anything else, we have a crisis of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent crisis was precipitated by the Lithuanian Communist Party's 
declaration of its independence from the Soviet Communist Party last month in 
an unprecedented split that ultimately threatens the unity of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is scheduled to visit Lithuania this week in a search for a 
compromise that will preserve party and state unity while assuring the 
Lithuanians real political and economic autonomy in a restructured, federal 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined there will be a compromise, that this problem will be 
resolved through political and democratic means," said a party official who 
expects to travel to Lithuania himself as member of Gorbachev's peace mission. 
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot, at this point, see the shape of that compromise. We know it 
must satisfy not just the Lithuanians and ourselves (liberal supporters of 
Gorbachev) but also the conservatives. Otherwise, there will be a fight, and 
Gorbachev might be among the victims." 
</P>
<P>
These negotiations are being followed closely by the neighboring Estonians and 
Latvians along with the equally restive Ukrainians, Moldavians, Armenians, 
Georgians and Azerbaijanis. Recent unrest in Azerbaijan along the 
Soviet-Iranian border has underscored the need to deal with these ethnic 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian talks are also being watched, however, by increasingly 
nationalistic ethnic Russians who fear the country's dismemberment. They also 
resent the bitter criticism aimed as much at them as the Soviet system by other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
For party conservatives, the Lithuanians' declaration of independence has 
proved to be almost a perfect issue with which to charge Gorbachev with going 
too far, too fast and undermining not just socialism but the stability and 
unity of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"This was such a heavy blow to Mikhail Gorbachev," a Central Committee official 
commented, criticizing the Lithuanians. "People should assess not only what 
they could gain but what they could lose from such actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, within the Central Committee and elsewhere, conservatives say, 'See, this 
is what perestroika, democratization and glasnost (openness) have brought -- 
anarchy, the destruction of socialism, the dismemberment of the party and 
state.' That is why a compromise is so important and so urgent." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev hopes that he and other members of the party's ruling Politburo will 
be able to fashion a compromise over the next two or three weeks or so with 
Lithuanian party leaders. His recommendation will be debated by the Central 
Committee at a special meeting, which was broken off last month after two days 
of often angry debate. 
</P>
<P>
If his proposals on Lithuania prove unacceptable, as his supporters are 
warning, then the whole reform program will be in jeopardy from the 
conservative backlash. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee is also scheduled to meet at the end of January to debate 
a new party program, a fundamental political statement that will both sum up 
the reforms so far and set the course for the next five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Already the focus of much political infighting, the program could divide the 
party even more sharply between the party's liberal and conservative wings as 
Gorbachev seeks to accelerate and broaden his reforms at the party congress 
scheduled for October.

HIGH-TECH ON THE HIGHWAY; 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAYS: VIDEO CAMERAS ARE BEING TESTED THAT WOULD CATCH CAR-POOL-LANE 
VIOLATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It could be the traffic cop of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, from the Washington Beltway to the streets of Pasadena, 
transportation officials are turning to the camera to crack down on motorists 
guilty of everything from speeding to running stop lights. 
</P>
<P>
Now the concept could be coming to California in an even bigger way. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the California Department of Transportation and the California 
Highway Patrol are looking at using video cameras to nab motorists who violate 
car-pool-lane rules on freeways up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
The new video technology, which features super-slow-motion replay machines and 
cameras as tiny as a lipstick tube, has already had a dry run on the Artesia 
and Simi Valley freeways in Los Angeles County and was tested again Thursday in 
Orange County along the Costa Mesa Freeway's car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
For the CHP, the idea has particular allure. If the video technique proves 
feasible, it could help shrink violation rates in car-pool lanes and relieve 
officers of the dangerous task of pulling scofflaws across three or four lanes 
of freeway traffic to issue a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in testing any kind of technique that could help out," said 
Lt. Shawn Watts of the CHP's transportation planning unit in Sacramento. "This 
looks pretty good because it would possibly save a lot of officer time, reduce 
their exposure to traffic out there and hopefully catch more violators." 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials agree the idea shows promise, but obstacles remain. 
Technological hurdles must be overcome, and logistical changes might be 
necessary before tickets could be delivered to motorists via the mail. 
</P>
<P>
And as they have in other parts of the country, some residents and civil 
liberties groups likely will conjure Orwellian images of "Big Brother," saying 
the cameras infringe on the privacy of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking for myself, the 'Big Brother' aspect of it is a little disturbing," 
said Bill Ward, a leader of Drivers for Highway Safety, a small Orange 
County-based group opposed to car-pool lanes. "I just don't see this going very 
far." 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials, however, insist the benefits of video traffic 
enforcement techniques far outweigh the risks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those kinds of arguments, the 'Big Brother' thing, can be overcome and 
has to be overcome," said Steve Albert, a Texas-based expert on the use of 
video cameras for monitoring traffic. "Like every other technological 
advancement, it will come in time." 
</P>
<P>
Most authorities in California estimate it could be as long as five years 
before the video cameras could become a fixture along car-pool lanes in the 
state. A host of difficulties must first be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Initial tests, which are being conducted as part of a larger study of car-pool 
enforcement, have been hampered by the tedious task of positioning cameras just 
right so they can peer down into a car to spot the less-obvious passenger -- a 
baby on board or someone lying down on the back seat. Tinted windows, sun 
glare, morning mist on the windshield and other environmental factors also can 
obscure the camera's view. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming those sorts of troubles can be ironed out, state authorities would 
still have to deal with the problem of angry motorists, who might reject the 
idea of receiving a ticket through the mail. Laws would probably have to be 
adjusted so the burden of a ticket falls on the owner of a vehicle instead of 
the driver, a regulation that might irk any parent whose teen-ager got caught 
by the camera driving solo down the car-pool lane in the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Even the issue of who monitors the cameras and videotape could prove vexing. 
Though some cities have hired outside firms to pluck violators from the 
pictures and search the records for vehicle owners, California authorities 
envision a system that would probably employ sworn peace officers to determine 
who has broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is decided, the concept promises to engender a fair amount of debate. 
Surveys conducted as part of the car-pool violation study found motorists 
"equally divided" over camera-patrolled car-pool lanes, according to John 
Billheimer, vice president of Systan Inc., a Los Altos-based transportation 
planning firm doing the study for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
The concept has been in use for years in other parts of the world. West Germany 
has had an active "photo-radar" program for about two decades, and the 
technique is used to nab speeders elsewhere in Europe, Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Photo-radar, which combines still photographs with radar to determine a 
motorist's speed, has only recently made an appearance in the United States. 
Although some residents quickly dubbed it "robocop," the technique has been 
used successfully in Paradise Valley, Ariz., since 1987. Pasadena began issuing 
citations with the same Swiss-made device in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 14,000 speeding tickets have been issued in Pasadena for 
motorists caught by the photo-radar, said Sgt. Gene Gray of the Pasadena 
police. Nearly 300 people fought their tickets, but the city prevailed in 90% 
of those cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is being considered for the Washington area. Officials with the 
Virginia State Police are investigating the use of photo-radar or video cameras 
to ticket speeders along the 60 miles of freeway circling the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In California, authorities are focusing for now on using such high-tech ploys 
simply to uphold the law of the car-pool lane. While state officials are quick 
to emphasize that the concept is still in the testing stages, they have a hard 
time hiding their optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the safety issues, I think it could be a great tool," said Scott 
McGowen, an assistant transportation engineer with Caltrans in Sacramento. 
"We'll have to look into the costs some more, and maintenance of such a system. 
But this could help with many problems we have now.

1990 LESSONS BEING TAUGHT AT AN 1860 SCHOOLHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
COLUMBIA, Calif. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Schoolchildren from around the state take field trips to this historic gold 
rush town and relive what school was like in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are conducted for the visitors as they were when the Columbia school 
opened that year. The two-story, red-brick schoolhouse stands on a hill 
overlooking this hamlet in Tuolumne County. 
</P>
<P>
Students learn old-fashioned penmanship. They read from McGuffey's Eclectic 
Readers. They work math problems from 130-year-old arithmetic books. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the desks are original 1860 lift-tops with inkwells. Others are 
replicas. Rooms are lighted with kerosene lanterns. A potbellied stove provides 
heat. There's a dipper and water bucket for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
An American Flag with 33 stars hangs in front of the classroom. There were only 
33 states in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the school are two outhouses. No indoor plumbing here. A crooked oak 
stick lies on the teacher's desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers were strict in those days," said Ralph Hilbert, 68, a retired 
Whittier elementary school teacher who was portraying a vintage-1860 
instructor. Dressed in a derby, long black coat, stiff white shirt, bow tie and 
black trousers, he waved the stick in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"If a projectile of any kind was thrown, it was five whacks on the backside 
with a stick like this," he said. "Fingernails, necks and ears were inspected 
for cleanliness every morning before class. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was to be placed in inkwells except pen points. Each child had duties, 
fetching a pail of water, cleaning the erasers and blackboards, sweeping the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
All of Columbia is a state park. Founded in 1850, it is the Williamsburg of the 
West Coast. The 19th-Century homes, shops and public buildings here were set 
aside as a California State Historical Monument in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
For 77 years kindergarten-to-eighth-grade classes were held in the old 
schoolhouse on the hill. After the gold rush, Columbia thrived for a while. But 
gradually, the town lost residents, and in 1937, during the Great Depression, 
the school closed. 
</P>
<P>
For several years after the town became a historical monument, the school 
remained abandoned. It deteriorated. It was falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, a fund-raising campaign to save Columbia School was 
conducted in elementary schools all over the state. Thousands of students 
contributed pennies, nickels and dimes to rescue, restore and preserve Columbia 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia School reopened as a museum on its 100th birthday, brought back to 
what it was like when it first opened in 1860, thanks to the more than $60,000 
donated by boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the old red-brick schoolhouse has belonged to all elementary school 
children in California. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago Sherrin Grout, 42, longtime ranger at the Columbia historical 
park, and Hilbert, along with several teacher volunteers, brought the school 
back to life by conducting 1860 classroom sessions and making it more than just 
a museum. 
</P>
<P>
"To participate in this unique experience, schools make reservations in advance 
for field trips to Columbia and the old schoolhouse," Grout explained. 
"Students come here, sit in the old desks and learn from Ralph Hilbert and the 
other volunteer teachers what school was like in California 130 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Hilbert noted that when the school first opened in 1860, students sat on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The school furniture hadn't come around the Horn yet from the East," he 
related. "Boys and girls sat on separate sides of the room then. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls entered and left class before boys. Students were not permitted to write 
using the left hand. Their clothes had to cover their legs and arms 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
If a student misbehaved, Hilbert continued, the culprit would get whacked with 
the oak stick or sit on a dunce stool the rest of the day wearing a long, 
pointed dunce hat. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids tell us they're glad they're going to school now, not then," Grout 
said.

BAY OF PIGS PRESS STRATEGY RULED OUT FOR REAGAN; 
</P>

MEDIA: RELATIONS WITH JOURNALISTS HAVE BECOME MORE ADVERSARIAL SINCE THE 
KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. PRESS SECRETARIES HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR TACK.

When the Iran-Contra affair began darkening the Reagan Administration's 
horizon, Ronald Reagan's advisers hoped to calm the political storm by stealing 
a page from one of the most famous presidential mea culpas in recent history: 
John F. Kennedy's apology for the Bay of Pigs debacle. 
</P>
<P>
As recounted by Reagan press secretary Larry Speakes last weekend at a UC San 
Diego symposium that featured 10 former White House spokesmen, Reagan's aides 
hoped to duplicate the manner in which Kennedy effectively defused the 1961 
controversy by firmly and immediately shouldering the blame for the botched 
Cuban invasion. 
</P>
<P>
A quick check of the historical record, however, persuaded the Reagan team that 
what had been a brilliant strategy in 1961 would be a dismal failure a quarter 
century later -- a difference owing less to distinctions between the two 
episodes than to the evolution of a markedly more adversarial relationship 
between the press and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
With Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger filling in details, Speakes 
recalled how Kennedy had accepted responsibility for the Bay of Pigs but 
refused to answer questions about the specifics of the incident on the grounds 
that it was "not in the national interest." Indicative of press-presidential 
relations of the period, reporters placidly accepted that explanation -- and 
Kennedy's popularity subsequently soared. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, however, Vietnam and Watergate introduced "a 
flowering of contempt" to the press-presidential relationship, said Ron Nessen, 
press secretary for former President Gerald R. Ford. Well aware of reporters' 
lessened deference toward the President, Speakes said he quickly realized that 
Kennedy's public-relations approach to the Bay of Pigs "just wouldn't fly" for 
Reagan and the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
"We attempted to convince the President to say, 'I take full responsibility,' " 
Speakes said. "But we knew that in this day and age . . . we would have never 
been able to say, 'It's not in the national interest to talk anymore about it.' 
We couldn't have gotten away with what Kennedy was able to do 30 years before." 
</P>
<P>
Speakes' explanation of Reagan's handling of the Iran-Contra affair was one of 
dozens of insightful, often humorous recitations of how presidents faced 
crises, large and small, as recalled by the 10 men who served as their primary 
White House spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's three-hour wrap-up of the unprecedented gathering of press 
secretaries from six past administrations, stretching from Kennedy through 
Reagan, the former spokesmen discussed their successes and failures at image 
management with about a dozen professors, journalists and former White House 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the lessons of 1961 must be reevaluated in light of the 
dramatic changes in how the press now covers the President, Salinger argued 
that Kennedy's unflinching willingness to accept blame for a major failure 
remains a valid prototype for responses to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"If in the first two or three days of the Watergate story, Richard Nixon had 
gone on television and said, 'I made a stupid mistake' . . . and he fired a 
couple of people, Watergate would have never happened," Salinger said. "It 
would have been a thing that would have gone away if he had accepted the 
responsibility for it." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler, however, dismissed that theory as overly 
simplistic. Nixon's response to the burgeoning controversy that grew out of the 
break-in at the Democratic national headquarters and ultimately cost him his 
office, Ziegler said, was influenced by the lingering impact of earlier or 
continuing woes such as the Pentagon Papers case and Vietnam -- in particular, 
by the considerable enmity that had developed between Nixon and the press 
because of those matters. 
</P>
<P>
Insider anecdotes from the former press secretaries yielded glimpses into 
presidential personalities certain to fascinate armchair psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Johnson, for example, insisted on personally approving any statement 
issued on behalf of the White House and was infuriated by premature leaks of 
Administration actions, sometimes changing planned appointments because of 
them, said Bill Moyers, one of his three White House spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Johnson, angered by a news story in which a U.S. senator had been mildly 
critical of him and searching for a proper reprisal, seized on Moyers' 
suggestion that his press secretary publicly label the senator "obstreperous." 
When the presidential rejoinder did not play well in the media, a furious 
Johnson demanded of Moyers: "Who called him obstreperous?" 
</P>
<P>
"You did!" a startled Moyers replied. To which Johnson shouted: "I can't even 
spell the goddamn word!" 
</P>
<P>
One of the more intriguing challenges that faced each of them, the press 
secretaries said, involved knowing when to take the President at his word and 
when to ignore a presidential command, often issued in the heat of the moment. 
Or, to frame the dilemma another way: What should a press secretary do when the 
President has a dumb idea? 
</P>
<P>
"We've all faced situations when you need to interpret the President," admitted 
Jody Powell, press secretary to former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among the former spokesmen is that the best approach is to delay 
public action on such occasions, stalling in the hope that the President's 
anger will pass or his better judgment will return. For example, when Johnson 
instructed Moyers to fire a top aide and inform a prominent newspaper columnist 
of the dismissal, Moyers did neither. Later, when Johnson asked him what he had 
done, Moyers simply said neither man had been home when he tried to call -- and 
never heard about the matter again.

ROMANIA COUNCIL COMPLETES NEW ELECTION LAW; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: THE DRAFT OUTLINES AN AMERICAN-STYLE SYSTEM. CONCERN RISES THAT THE 
RULING FRONT IS ACTING IN SECRET.

<TEXT>
<P>
The draft of a new election law, ensuring free elections and a multi-party 
system, has been completed by the ruling council of Romania's National 
Salvation Front and will be presented this week to the provisional government. 
</P>
<P>
The draft law, largely the work of Dumitru Mazilu, the vice president of the 
11-membership leadership council of the front, also spells out a government 
structure that will have some features of the American system, with independent 
legislative, executive and judicial branches. 
</P>
<P>
The draft law calls for a new senate, a 235-seat assembly and an office of 
president, limited to a single, five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Sunday, Mazilu said the law will allow all citizens 18 years 
and older to register to vote in primary and runoff elections, with 
discrimination against religious or ethnic minorities expressly prohibited. He 
said the law will provide for a system of vote counting and observation by 
opposing political parties to prevent vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The front has said the elections will be held in April. However, over the 
weekend, the leadership said it is willing to discuss postponing the vote 
because some opposition groups have said they need more time to organize. 
</P>
<P>
Mazilu's comments came as three small demonstrations were held in Bucharest to 
protest what some Romanians say is high-handed behavior by the National 
Salvation Front, which was created Dec. 22, the day that Romanian dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu fled the capital. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were 
executed by a military firing squad Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 students, gathering at the university Sunday, charged that the 
National Salvation Front, composed mostly of dissident Communists who came to 
oppose the Ceausescu regime, have "hijacked" the Romanian revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The National Peasants Party, in a street rally outside its Bucharest 
headquarters, charged that the front is "acting as a political party without 
having been elected." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations occurred against a backdrop of concern that the front is 
failing to employ democratic processes and is acting in secret. 
</P>
<P>
Even Mazilu, in some matters, agreed with the protesters' criticisms. He 
pointed out that on Saturday night, two Communists were given time on 
television, in effect explaining and defending the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"But they did not allow the Peasants Party or the Democratic Party to go on 
television," Mazilu said. "Why? The television people said that these two 
parties were not registered. I said to them, 'Are the Communists registered? 
No, they are not.' Well, they said, they have been the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not good enough," Mazilu said. "Everyone must be allowed access to 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very strange times we are in now," Mazilu went on. "The old 
mechanisms are still functioning. People continue to think in a very old 
fashion. So, the people who run the television, they call me and ask if it is 
all right if they let other people speak." 
</P>
<P>
Mazilu, 55, along with former diplomat Silviu Brucan, is perhaps the most 
widely known Romanian dissident. A former member of the Romanian foreign 
service, Mazilu produced a scathing attack on the Romanian human-rights 
situation in May, 1986. His passport was immediately revoked, he lost his job 
and he and his family were subject to harassment that lasted to the day that 
Ceausescu was toppled. 
</P>
<P>
From 1987 until Dec. 22, he was under house arrest in his modest apartment in 
Bucharest, unable even to walk to the corner market. His wife was followed by 
squads of police when she went shopping. Teams of police watched his house 
around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no money, no food," he said. "Even my sister, when she tried to visit 
me, was arrested and beaten." Under mysterious circumstances, his 54-year-old 
brother dropped dead on the street. His mother, also in apparent good health, 
died suddenly in the same year, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 19th, as the end was nearing for Ceausescu, Securitate secret-police 
officers broke through the Mazilu front door in the middle of night. He was 
beaten in the face in the presence of his wife and 13-year-old son. He was 
taken away and later hammered in the chest with the stock of a rifle. His wife 
and children were taken away in their pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was the end for us," Mazilu said Sunday. "My greatest fear was 
that they would kill my wife and my son before my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
They were freed Dec. 22, when Ceausescu fled. Since then, except for Saturday 
night, Mazilu has slept on a cot in his office in the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Mazilu is now pressing all members in the front, and in the provisional 
government, to renounce their membership in the Communist Party -- or any other 
party -- or, failing that, to leave their new positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to be against Ceausescu," Mazilu said. "We are changing a 
totalitarian system. It was the system that produced Ceausescu, and if we do 
not change the system, sooner or later it will produce another dictator." 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of Ceausescu, Mazilu said, Communists are coming to 
the National Salvation Front council to ask for ranking ministerial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Where were these people before?" Mazilu said. "We who opposed the system 
before were so few, maybe 20 or 25 people. Now we have people coming forward 
saying they were opposed. But these were people who supported Ceausescu day and 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, they have changed their clothes and say they have changed their minds. I 
cannot believe the cynicism. People have died for this revolution. Not just a 
few people. Thousands died for it. We have a duty, before the nation and before 
the world, to protect the revolution they died for." 
</P>
<P>
The problem that Mazilu addressed seems spread throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Brasov, a city of 350,000 and one of the most important industrial cities in 
the country, the local committee of the National Salvation Front has only two 
members of the dreaded Securitate in custody. The top-ranking Securitate 
members, according to Gen. Ion Flora, who heads the local committee, are "at 
their homes" but not under guard. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of a local newspaper, Gazeta de Transylvania, charged that the 
front's local committee is "like a black box: things go in and things come out, 
but no one knows what goes on inside." 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming concern with security has added to the impression that 
decisions are being made in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that the totalitarian system under Ceausescu has deprived 
Romanians of any knowledge of how an open government ought to be run. They 
simply have no experience with the process. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other nations undergoing far-reaching changes, Romania had allowed no 
dissident organizations, such as Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia or Solidarity in 
Poland.

MOSCOW ALLOWS S. KOREAN JETLINER TO DETOUR THROUGH SOVIET AIRSPACE

The Soviet Union on Sunday allowed a South Korean jetliner to fly over its 
territory after a volcanic eruption in Alaska prevented the plane from taking 
the North Pole route to Paris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a regular Korean Air flight was allowed to pass through 
Soviet airspace en route to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The KAL Boeing 747 carrying 290 passengers and crew arrived in the French 
capital shortly before noon after a 13-hour flight. At the request of Korean 
Air, Moscow allowed the plane's flight over its territory after an eruption of 
Alaska's Redoubt volcano prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to 
prohibit air traffic near the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
KAL officials said the Soviet permission for the flight was temporary but said 
they will be allowed to use the Soviet route regularly after the conclusion of 
an aviation agreement with Moscow early this year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a KAL Boeing 747 from New York to Seoul by way of Anchorage was downed 
by Soviet military jets after straying into Soviet territory near the island of 
Sakhalin. All 269 people on board were killed.

A historian evoked poignant memories of Abraham Lincoln and his family for an 
enraptured audience at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
David Herbert Donald of Harvard University sketched everyday life in the White 
House during the Civil War years for the 16th President, his spendthrift wife, 
Mary Todd Lincoln, and their sons. The lecture was the first in a series that 
President Bush and his wife, Barbara, are hosting on the presidency to, in 
Bush's words, make "the men who held this office . . . come alive." "We always 
think today our lives are so complicated," Mrs. Bush observed after the 
lecture. "Then you look at what Lincoln stepped into . . . things look pretty 
good for us."

Alleging "gluttonous thievery from the new robber barons," Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) demanded an investigation into the oil industry for possible 
collusion in raising home heating oil prices.

Driven by unseasonably cold temperatures, the prices rose to record highs in 
December. D'Amato noted the price per gallon for consumers last week was $1.40, 
an increase of 43 cents from November. The House Energy and Commerce Committee 
was scheduled to hold a hearing on the increase Tuesday.

The trial of a graduate student charged with crippling a national computer 
network, scheduled to open this week, was expected to call attention to 
security laws that protect electronic communications systems. Jury selection 
was to begin today in the case of Robert T. Morris Jr., 24, of Arnold, Md., the 
first person to be tried criminally under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and 
Abuse Act. Morris, suspended from graduate studies at Cornell University at 
Syracuse, N. Y., is accused of designing and disseminating in November, 1988, a 
rogue program or "worm" that immobilized some 6,000 computers linked to a 
research network, including some used by NASA and the Air Force.

<P>
A Pacific storm system dampened Northern California and dropped up to half a 
foot of snow on the Sierra Nevada, and forecasters predicted that another front 
would bring more welcome precipitation today. 
</P>
<P>
While the latest storm brought only light rain followed by decreasing showers 
to most of the region, it drenched the North Coast with several inches, 
according to the National Weather Service. The storm also doused parts of the 
Sierra Nevada with several inches of snow. Rain was predicted for the North 
Coast, the Sacramento Valley and the Bay Area today. The prognosis wasn't that 
good for the Southland, however. Forecasters said the next chance of rain here 
will not occur until Thursday.

A cable car jolted to a stop to avoid a car while descending a hill, but there 
were no serious injuries, authorities said. Several passengers complained of 
minor pain after being knocked against poles and other inside parts of the 
cable car on Mason Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three women passengers went to San Francisco General Hospital, where they were 
in stable condition while being observed for possible injuries, a nursing 
supervisor said. The incident occurred when a car made a left-hand turn in 
front of the cable car at Union Street, said Police Officer Emmett Hickson. 
Because the trolley was headed downhill, the gripman already had the brake on 
and was forced to apply the emergency brake to stop, Hickson said.

PREGNANCY DIABETES

<P>
Question: If a woman is found to have diabetes when she becomes pregnant for 
the first time, does that mean she'll probably have the same problem each time 
she becomes pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is estimated that about one-third of women who develop diabetes 
during one pregnancy will not have a recurrence during a subsequent pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons suggested to explain this are changes in diet, exercise 
habits, the degree of stress they may be subjected to and other life-style 
factors that may affect diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Women who develop diabetes during one pregnancy as well as during a subsequent 
pregnancy are more likely to be heavier than women who don't.

'THE GRANNY' A COMIC PARABLE IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granny is 100 years old -- and still eating after all those years. Interminable 
and insatiable, she's a perpetual consumption machine. She'll lick your plate 
clean, as well as her own. Within 20 minutes after she retires at night, she's 
ready for breakfast. And she never gets fat. Her metabolism is a biological 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Give her this day her daily bread -- and her daily pasta, popcorn, chocolates, 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
This old lady is the centerpiece of "The Granny" ("La Nonna"), a remarkably 
potent comic parable at the Old Globe. 
</P>
<P>
First produced in Buenos Aires in 1977, Roberto M. Cossa's play was, at the 
time, a muted howl against the Argentine military dictators. The other 
characters' efforts to satisfy Granny invariably fail. While doing her bidding, 
they gradually lose their moral compass, but she demands still more. Finally, 
one by one, they "disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Granny is not necessarily synonymous with the Argentine regime of the 
time, for she has outlived it. Her story has a number of other possible 
interpretations in San Diego in 1990, and it's part of the fun of this play to 
apply its symbolism to our own culture. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see now: Granny as the baby boomer generation, 30 years hence. Granny as 
a Wall Street buccaneer. Granny as the politicians who ignore the federal 
deficit. Granny as anyone who is better at consuming than at creating or 
conserving. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to play this game to enjoy "The Granny," however. Even -- or 
especially -- on the most literal level, this is a wickedly funny show. Much of 
the comedy is due to the inspired casting of John Fleck as the Granny. 
</P>
<P>
The more adventurous Los Angeles theater audiences know Fleck as a outre 
performance artist with an interest in androgyny, a wide vocal range and a 
predilection for doing strange things with goldfish. Well, in "The Granny," 
Fleck is in deep drag. He gets to hum snatches of opera in his falsetto, then 
drop into his basso register in the play's final scene. 
</P>
<P>
But Fleck isn't just repeating his own act. Twisting his gaze in order to 
appraise his chances at grabbing another bite off someone's plate, flicking his 
tongue in satisfaction over each morsel, then demanding more with steely 
resolve despite whatever chaos is happening around him, his Granny has the 
integrity of a precisely sketched cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Garrett-Groag's arena staging, in the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage, doesn't do full justice to Fleck's performance. During a long sequence 
near the end of the first act, the spectators in the north and east sections of 
the house were roaring with laughter at Fleck's antics, while those of us in 
the south and west sections saw nothing but his back. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fleck is hardly the whole show. La Nonna's grandsons, the 
hard-working Carmelo (Patrick Husted) and the indolent Chicho (Marcelo Tubert) 
are hilarious as they try to cope with the old woman and the poverty that her 
gluttony engenders. 
</P>
<P>
As La Nonna's anxious daughter, Myriam Tubert frets well, to no avail. Rose 
Portillo's Maria, Carmelo's wife, worries with a harder edge; as the only 
character who isn't related by blood to La Nonna, she has a degree of 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
Laura P. Vega plays Carmelo's and Maria's daughter, Marta, whose dress for her 
job in a "pharmacy" become progressively sluttier as the play continues (Robert 
Wojewodski did the costumes). As a hapless neighbor who is roped into matrimony 
with La Nonna, Julio Medina is a pitiful emblem of foolish vanity. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett-Groag's ensemble exhibits crackerjack timing. The accents are all over 
the map, but it doesn't matter as much in this stylized situation as it would 
in a more realistic play. Raul Moncada's translation uses plenty of 
contemporary American vernacular, the better to draw the parallels between 
there and here. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brill designed a house in disrepair, which looks as if it may slide off 
its foundation at any moment. Around the edges of the stage are fragments of 
advertisements, touting the good life that has so conspicuously eluded this 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 In Balboa Park, San Diego, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Ends Feb. 18. Tickets:

Florida Museum Hires Corcoran Director: Corcoran Gallery of Art Director 
Christina Orr-Cahall, who resigned last month after six months of controversy 
over her decision to cancel an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, has 
been named director of the Norton Gallery in Palm Beach, Fla. After Orr-Cahall 
leaves the Corcoran in Washington on Feb. 1, she will spend 2 1/2 months as a 
Woodrow Wilson Center guest scholar studying "The Impact of the Print Media on 
the Mapplethorpe Controversy." 
</P>
<P>
The Norton is a small private museum with a permanent collection focusing on 
19th- and 20th-Century Impressionists. Orr-Cahall worked there as a curatorial 
consultant for two years in the late '70s. Her cancellation of the Mapplethorpe 
show last June, which she said was intended to keep the museum out of a 
political battle over National Endowment for the Arts funding of potentially 
offensive art, was greeted with widespread criticism and calls for her 
resignation from the arts community. Orr-Cahall resigned as director of the 
Corcoran the day trustees were scheduled to vote on her future at the museum.

DANCE REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A FRED STRICKLER SAMPLER AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As dancer, choreographer, teacher over 30 years, Fred Strickler has become 
important to Southern California dance: a meticulous, versatile artist best 
known as co-founder of the Jazz Tap Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
However, a sampling of his work that Santa Monica College presented Friday on 
its Studio Stage suggested that Strickler is also a hostage to virtuosity, 
someone concealed behind intimidating technical display. 
</P>
<P>
In "Spinning Yarn" (1986), Strickler circled the stage in a chain of perfectly 
centered turns, while speaking of his earliest memories of dancing. His control 
here proved nearly as remarkable as his estrangement from the text: He talked 
of still feeling exhilaration, but where was that feeling in his face, his 
body, his voice? 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Strickler's role in "Between Friends" (1987-'88) on Friday, Paul 
Maillard had all the warmth and engagement that Strickler lacked at the duet's 
premiere. No, Maillard never looked as elegant as Strickler but his interplay 
with the accomplished Victoria Koenig (who had also been Strickler's partner) 
now came fully alive and the piece seemed more than just a fluent exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Jeff Friedman pierced the remoteness of Strickler style in "Center 
Divider" (1990), though, Lord knows, he was dressed like Strickler and assigned 
Strickler's trademark port de bras. Friedman's urgency -- his need to push 
through technique toward catharsis -- gave the solo's inventive, contorted 
lunges and undulations great emotional force. Composer Butch Rovan added his 
own intensity through the assaultive electro-clarinet accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the prowess that Strickler brought to an excerpt from "Fault" 
(1987) couldn't make the twitchy, flailing vocabulary genuinely expressive -- 
nor the partnership with Stephanie Gilliland memorable. This was bravura modern 
dance, all right, but even the wit of its juxtapositions seemed ultimately 
insular. 
</P>
<P>
Two familiar tap solos found Strickler in spectacular fettle, though 
"Excursions" (1984) still vandalized its Barber accompaniment by its doggedly 
literal step-note relationships. (What a relief when Althea Waites was allowed 
to simply play, without the tap-clatter). 
</P>
<P>
A section of "Tone Poem" (1981) led to the new "Five and Ten," in which 
Strickler for once appeared to dance for sheer pleasure. The vocal exchanges 
with composer Ray McNamara also revealed a spontaneity new in Strickler's 
performances, and the steps, too, looked relatively loose -- though scarcely 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond beguiling steel drum music and throwaway flair, "Five and Ten" 
represented a breakthrough: proof that Fred Strickler actually likes to dance. 
That's not the same thing as his showing off his credentials as a dancer, or 
wearing painted smiles on stage. It makes a big difference.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'HERE IS YOUR LIFE' LAUNCHES UCLA JAN TROELL RETROSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweden's Jan Troell is known for two splendid, straightforward epics: "The 
Emigrants" (1971), and its sequel, "The New Land" (1972), which compose the 
sprawling saga of a group of Swedes coming to America, and "Flight of the 
Eagle" (1982), about a gallant but foolhardy attempt to reach the North Pole by 
balloon in 1897. 
</P>
<P>
As fine as these films are, they do not prepare you for the sheer 
distinctiveness and dazzling impact of the heretofore unknown pictures that 
launch the UCLA Film Archives' "Jan Troell Retrospective." 
</P>
<P>
"Here Is Your Life" (1965), which screens Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz 
Theater, is one of the great coming-of-age films, based on Nobel Prize-winning 
Eyvind Johnson's semi-autobiographical novel and telling of the flowering of an 
impoverished but brilliant and persistent youth, born at the turn of the 
century. The way in which Troell expresses the imagination of Eddie Axberg's 
Olof, as he matures from 14 to 18, is never less than magical; "Here Is Your 
Life" is a less-harsh "Pelle the Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
The film is preceded by the half-hour "Stay in the Marshland" (1964), another 
adaptation from Johnson, which is, in its way, as sly and witty as Roman 
Polanski's famous short, "Two Men and a Wardrobe." Max Von Sydow stars. 
</P>
<P>
Screening Sunday at 6 p.m. is the documentary-like "Eenie Meenie Minie Moe" 
(1967), in which the intense Per Oscarsson gives a thoroughly harrowing 
performance as a contemporary schoolteacher losing control of himself and his 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Never has the plight of the teacher in the era of permissiveness been 
dramatized with such disturbing insight. That this teacher is miscast in his 
profession -- he privately acknowledges that he "sides with his pupils againt 
himself" -- throws in relief the love-hate that characterizes so many 
relationships between children and adults, yet Troell, himself a former 
teacher, leaves us with the sense that human nature at any age is finally an 
enigma. The second feature is "The Emigrants." 
</P>
<P>
Also commencing this week at the UCLA Film Archives is "New Hungarian Cinema," 
which begins Saturday at 7:30 p.m. with Sandor Simo's "Farewell to You" (1987) 
and Peter Bacso's "Banana Skin Waltz" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
The "Farewell" is a handsome, acutely perceptive, deeply sensual psychological 
drama centering on the residents of a fine old Budapest apartment house as they 
struggle to survive the ever-darkening war years. As a study of human nature 
under pressure, the film offers a cross-section of behavior, ranging from the 
heroic to the cowardly to the cruelly ironic. The film is marked by steamy 
sexual encounters, borne of desperation, and also by an unflinching depiction 
of a poisonous, ever-expanding anti-Semitism and a hysteria-charged Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
A Yasujiro Ozu series starts Friday at the Little Tokyo Cinema 2 with a perfect 
double feature, "Early Spring" (1956) and "The Record of a Tenement Gentleman" 
(1947). 
</P>
<P>
The first is one of Ozu's many compassionate studies of the lives of office 
workers, in this instance focusing on a decent, nice-looking young man (Ryo 
Ikebe) whose brief fling with the secretarial pool flirt (Keiko Kishi) 
endangers his marriage, already haunted by the loss of an only child. 
</P>
<P>
As Ikebe and his wife (Chikage Iwashima) struggle with their feelings, Ozu 
offers an unusually bleak view of the company man's existence. The very adult 
"Early Spring" is not downbeat, nor is "The Record of a Tenement Gentleman" 
even though it is set in the harsh aftermath of World War II. It is in fact an 
amusing yet poignant encounter between a blunt, even tactless middle-aged widow 
(Choko Iida) and a little lost boy as stolid and stubborn as she is.

ERRATIC BUT GOOD-SPIRITED 'REJOICE IN L.A.' BENEFITS EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sound of gospel music may make some cynics hide their wallets in their 
boots but, when it's good, it's hard to top. 
</P>
<P>
That lesson was evident during Saturday's erratic but good-spirited "Rejoice in 
Los Angeles" concert at the Forum benefiting the Inner City Foundation for 
Excellence in Education. It was a case of the sacred easily outshining and 
out-stomping the secular. 
</P>
<P>
After emcee Sinbad jokingly reassured the audience that there was no reason to 
leave early because there wouldn't be a collection plate passed around, the 
affair got off to a walloping start with more than half an hour of pure gospel. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone did indeed leave at that point, they would have already seen the 
evening's highlights: Even a heavy hitter like Stevie Wonder, the benefit's 
headliner, was no match for the premature climax reached by the show-opening 
appearances of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ Choir, the Faithful 
Central Baptist Voices of Faith Choir and gospel singer Daryl Coley. 
</P>
<P>
Later on, everyone's favorite poster boys for the preservation of a cappella, 
Take 6, proved crowd favorites with a brief set of their original spirituals. 
</P>
<P>
On the secular side, Motown's precocious Boys offered nice back flips and sorry 
singing during their untuneful two-song appearance; the Cruzados, providing the 
only rock 'n' roll of the evening, turned in a barely passable four-song set; 
advertised female vocal trio Expose failed to show up at all, and Wonder, as 
much a welcome benefit perennial as Jackson Browne in recent years, seemed to 
have no plan of action for his sporadically pleasing, low-energy, show-closing 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Wonder settled for sequencer-driven versions of a few hits, backed 
only by a rhythm section; then he played piano on a couple of nice, jazzy 
ballads; then he curiously started giving the microphone (and even his piano) 
away to other, unknown singers. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was time for the climactic appearance of the All-Star Celebrity 
Choir, which first tentatively backed Wonder on "Ebony and Ivory" and then 
collectively mauled Bob Dylan's defenseless "Forever Young," the theme song of 
the benefit. Against a quasi-funky backing, various stars half-sang 
half-verses, "We Are the World"-style, and Edward James Olmos even unveiled a 
new verse about staying in school.

KAOMA PLANTS ITS FEET AND LAMBADA FIRMLY AT THE PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What's happening with the lambada? Can it be -- oh no! -- that the sexy new 
Brazilian dance, the hottest music movement to arrive in years, has already 
experienced its 15 minutes of fame? 
</P>
<P>
Rest your fears. Although it's been pretty much an underground phenomenon since 
it first arrived in the Southland recently, the thigh-intertwined, 
pelvis-to-pelvis dance, with its infectiously rhythmic music, has been popping 
up all over the place -- from dance classes and discos to TV news bites and a 
New Year's Eve appearance on CBS. But it still hasn't attained the mass market 
intensity that has made it such a startling success in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All that may now be changing. Friday night the lambada entered a new phase with 
the appearance in town of Kaoma, the multinational group that started the whole 
thing. Its performance at the Palace had all the trappings of an "event," with 
an overflow audience and the usual gaggle of celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
As the P.A. system roared out a colorful collection of rhythmic world beat 
music, the crowd's energy level sizzled with intensity. On the packed floor, 
little pockets of movement kept erupting into anticipatory variations on the 
sensuous lambada. Setting the pace, Felix Chavez, one of the pioneer 
instructors in the new dance, drew most of the notice. "This is a terrific 
dance," he said. "It's a great way for people to get acquainted -- fast!" 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the curtain, however, attention shifted to the stage, as 
the five musicians, three singers and eight dancers of Kaoma came on with an 
explosion of aural and visual energy. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the sunny, virtually impossible-to-resist rhythms, it wasn't hard 
to understand why Kaoma's music has been so astoundingly successful. Their 
initial single recording, "Lambada," sold 4 million copies in Europe and the 
United Kingdom in six months -- the largest-selling single in the history of 
CBS Records' European operation. The group's new Epic album, "World Beat," has 
also taken off with a rush, selling more than half a million copies in the 
first two weeks of its European release. 
</P>
<P>
Kaoma made it clear, from the first pulsating notes of "Dancando Lambada," that 
they are a first-class musical ensemble, as well. 
</P>
<P>
The music flowed easily from one song to the next. While pieces like 
"Lambareggae" and "Lamba Caribe" may initially have been conceived to broaden 
both the rhythms and the reach of the lambada, they were appealingly melodic 
enough to fully stand on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Kaoma's eight young dancers were the visual highlight of the performance, 
spinning and twirling across the stage with impossible reserves of enthusiasm 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Kaoma launched into its second encore rendition of "Lambada," most 
of the audience was moving in some kind of improvised version of the dance. 
"C'est magnifique!" shouted a young French woman, slinking through the 
multinational, multiethnic crowd.

BRONCOS EDGE STEELERS, 24-23

DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Denver Broncos, thirsting for a chance to avenge a pair of Super Bowl 
blowouts, managed to advance a step in their quest on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But they barely survived it against a team that knows all about getting blown 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-23, to move on to the AFC final at 
Mile High Stadium on Sunday against Cleveland, the team they beat in two 
thrillers that led to trips to the NFL's ultimate game. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a 71-yard drive engineered by John Elway that led to Melvin 
Bratton's one-yard touchdown run for the winning score with 2:27 left. That was 
Denver's only lead against a team whose last-in-the-league offense dominated 
most of the contest, a team that had lost its first two games this season by a 
combined score of 92-10. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed we had a lot of guts," Bratton said of the Broncos, who lost the 
1986 and 1987 Super Bowls by something approximating that -- 81-30. Then he 
added, with only a slight misstatement: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I got it. In the past, every time I score the winning touchdown, we 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Denver had lost three of its past four games after clinching the AFC 
West with five weeks to go, although the Broncos still had the AFC's best 
record at 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, by contrast, had to win five of its last six games to make the 
playoffs at 9-7, then beat Houston in overtime in the wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Pittsburgh that controlled most of the game as the unheralded Merril 
Hoge became the first back to run for 100 yards against the Broncos this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He finished with 120 yards in 16 carries and an 11-yard touchdown run. He ran 
for 75 yards in the first quarter alone as the Steelers jumped to leads of 10-0 
and 17-7. But the Broncos tied it in a span of 2:28 on a 43-yard field goal by 
David Treadwell and a 37-yard pass from Elway to Vance Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Anderson's field goals of 35 and 32 yards put the Steelers ahead, 23-17, 
before Elway began the drive that won the game midway through the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Steelers, who averaged a league-low 251 yards, gained 404 against 
the Broncos, who allowed the league's fewest points and limited Pittsburgh to 
170 yards and seven first downs in a 34-7 victory Nov. 5. And quarterback Bubby 
Brister matched Elway pass for pass -- he was 19 of 29 for 229 yards, including 
a nine-yard touchdown to Louis Lipps. Elway was 12 of 20 for 226 and scrambled 
for 44 more. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say they're better than we are," Brister said. "They won, but it's a 
shame we have to lose a game like this one." 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to run, but we never knew we could run this well," Hoge said. 
"We could have won the game, we should have won the game. But the breaks went 
against us at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Elway began the winning drive with an 18-yard pass to Mark Jackson, then hit 
Johnson for 36 yards on a flea-flicker. Bobby Humphrey, who finished with 85 
yards in 18 carries, ran for nine, five and seven yards to the two before 
Bratton ran in from the one on third down. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we were down all day, but we had confidence we could come back," 
Humphrey said. "When you have guys with experience like we do, you always know 
you're in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Added one of those guys with experience, All-Pro linebacker Karl Mecklenburg: 
</P>
<P>
"We've been there before. We want to go again. We expected a tough game and we 
got one." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh took the opening kickoff and used 7:47 with Tim Worley and Hoge 
carrying the football 65 yards in 13 plays to set up Anderson's 32-yard field 
goal. There was only one pass on the drive, an 11-yard toss from Brister to 
Lipps. 
</P>
<P>
Hoge, Worley and Brister went at it again as the Steelers took just five plays 
and 2:27 to take a 10-0 lead 1:38 into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
First, Hoge burst 45 yards to the Denver 48, then Brister passed to Worley for 
33 yards over the middle to the 15. On a third-and-two from the seven, Brister 
handed to Hoge from the shotgun formation and he ran around left end for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton went in from the one to cut it to 10-7 with 6:22 left in the second 
quarter at the end of a 75-yard, 12-play drive that was aided by two key 
penalties -- an offside against Greg Lloyd and a holding call against Bryan 
Hinkle. Treadwell's extra point barely made it over the crossbar after Aaron 
Jones got a hand on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers came right back to score on Brister's nine-yard pass to Lipps with 
26 seconds left in the second quarter at the end of a 77-yard, 12-play drive 
that featured a 19-yard run by Worley and third-down completions from Brister 
to Hoge and Lipps. The touchdown came on a third-down play on which Lipps 
simply turned around at the goal line and caught the football after it was 
drilled in by Brister. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 17-7, but Elway hit Jackson for 26 yards and Ricky Nattiel for 15 
to put the Broncos in position for Treadwell's 43-yard field goal that cut the 
deficit to 17-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers held the Broncos on their first possession of the third quarter, 
then Brister completed a 23-yard pass to Weegie Thompson on the first offensive 
play. But on the second, Rich Kragen stripped Worley, Tyrone Braxton recovered 
at the Steeler 37 and one play later, Elway hit a wide-open Johnson at the goal 
line to tie the score just two minutes into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Steelers came back with a 62-yard drive that led to Anderson's 35-yard 
field goal that gave the Steelers a 20-17 lead midway through the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson made it 23-17 seven seconds into the fourth quarter with a 32-yard 
field goal set up by Thomas Everett's interception of Elway's pass. 
</P>
<P>
But Elway started the winning drive with 7:06 remaining and the Broncos 
survived.

ANALYSIS: PASS BY GIANTS LATE IN FIRST HALF PLAYS INTO RAM HANDS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flipper runs, Flipper leaps and Flipper scores. Now here's the catch: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's grand prize was an all-expenses-paid plane ride to San Francisco for 
60 minutes of fun and frolic against the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers, 
who are so worried about the Repeater Jinx that they took the Minnesota 
Vikings' league-leading defense this weekend, slapped it around for 41 points 
and left the field chewing on toothpicks. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at San Francisco," says John Robinson, Ram coach and travel guide. 
"They're the team of the decade -- and this might be the best team they've ever 
had, probably playing at their highest level of the season. They're one of the 
best teams of all-time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been on the road a month, we're exhausted. They're rested, they looked 
great on Saturday. They're almost unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson pauses to let it all sink in, setting up the inevitable punchline. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 'em right where we want 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson laughs at his own joke, but he is permitted. It beats crying. With a 
jet-lagged offense that barely outpointed the New York Giants in overtime and a 
tattered defense that lost two more defensive backs Sunday, the Rams, for their 
efforts, get to limp up the coast next week and face Joe Montana, Jerry Rice 
and Roger Craig for the third time since October. 
</P>
<P>
There ought to be a law, but the Rams, basking in the Meadowlands afterglow, 
are too giddy to lodge a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we've been looking for," wide receiver Henry Ellard says. "This 
is been in the back of our minds ever since we lost to them on Monday night. We 
let them off the hook that game and we've been wanting another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent three weeks on the East Coast. We've been fighting, and finally, we 
got there." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect so excites cornerback LeRoy Irvin that the Ram rapmaster was 
reduced to semi-coherent babble as he tried explain his feelings without 
mangling too many metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
"For once in my life, I'm starting to believe the critics," Irvin says. "Not 
much, but a little bit. A lot of them had confidence in us and now we're there, 
but we're nowhere near out of the forest. I can't even seen the light at the 
end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like the little kid with the finger in the dike. Today, we put our 
little finger in the hole and waited and waited. Then, just as the dam is going 
to burst, here comes the cavalry to save the day." 
</P>
<P>
But, then, isn't that how it is the with the Rams? Nobody knows how to explain 
it, to articulate it. 
</P>
<P>
It just happens. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants dominate the first half with a game plan that is the essence of 
inspired simplicity -- Ottis Anderson up the middle -- and seem set on running 
out the clock with a 6-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, Coach Bill Parcells has quarterback Phil Simms throw downfield, 
into coverage. A ball is tipped, safety Michael Stewart intercepts and, with 17 
seconds left, Jim Everett passes to Flipper Anderson in the end zone for a 7-6 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
One half later, the score is tied at 13-13 and the Rams, having frittered away 
two of their three timeouts, are trying to drive into field-goal range with 47 
seconds remaining. This they do by calling a draw play, passing over the middle 
to the tight end, handing off to Buford McGee and sending Everett on a scramble 
that exhausts the clock when Everett decides to slide, rather than run for the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Pee-wee footballers, do not try this at home. Johnny Unitas never worked the 
final minute this way. 
</P>
<P>
But are the Rams made to pay for their transgressions? 
</P>
<P>
First, they win the coin toss for the overtime kickoff when tackle Jackie 
Slater -- a heads man, always -- makes the call. 
</P>
<P>
Next, they get a 27-yard penalty when Giant cornerback Sheldon White tries to 
ride Anderson on a crossing pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they go to Anderson again at the right goal-line pylon -- an idea that 
resulted in an interception by Mark Collins early in the third quarter -- and 
this time Anderson beats Collins for the ball and the game-ending touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we know why Anderson keeps running, beyond the end line, up the tunnel, 
through the darkness and into the Rams' inner sanctum. When you're living the 
charmed life of the Rams, it pays to get out of town as soon as you can. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody," Irvin says, "always comes to save the Rams at the last possible 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
And, now, they get San Francisco. The Rams beat the 49ers at Candlestick on a 
Tom Rathman fumble, lost to them at Anaheim on a Ron Brown fumble and can only 
wonder what's going to happen once the ball stops bouncing. 
</P>
<P>
"We split with them," running back Greg Bell says. "We know we can play with 
them and we know how to play up there. We're going to have to play the game of 
our lives." 
</P>
<P>
It may take that, and then some, but the way Ellard sees it, the Rams represent 
the NFL's best, and last, hope of derailing the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they fear us, but they know we're the best team they can face 
that can beat them," Ellard says. "I think we proved that with that Monday 
night game, when we had them until John Taylor made a couple of big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same type of weapons on offense. They have Taylor, Rice and 
Montana. We have Anderson, Ellard and Everett. Greg Bell, Roger Craig. We match 
up with them." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the Rams should benefit from the opportunity of playing again in 
their own time zone. After successive cross-country hauls to New England, 
Philadelphia and New Jersey, San Francisco will feel like home. 
</P>
<P>
"By now, we're used to hopping back on the plane and celebrating," Everett 
says. "We knew going in that this was going to be our road in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The final destination remains New Orleans, but that connection in San Francisco 
can be a killer.

MARTIN MYTH GROWS, EVEN AFTER HIS DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grip Billy Martin held on some people did not loosen with his death. To the 
contrary, it probably will intensify as the mythology grows. 
</P>
<P>
What he means to those people was so clear in the letters and phone calls to 
Newsday rejecting any examination of his blemishes. Those were the people who 
stood and cheered him each time he appeared about to be fired as Yankee manager 
and each time he was brought back. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter what the newspapers said about the nature of the man, those 
fans believed what they wanted to believe. 
</P>
<P>
"I got very angry, regardless if (the writer's) statements were true or false," 
Robert Douglas of Franklin Square, N.Y., wrote. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon in our society that only good people die. When mean-spirited 
old Ty Cobb died did he suddenly become a warm, cuddly fellow who charmed his 
way through life? 
</P>
<P>
By that standard all the critical reporting and commentary on a public figure's 
life and career should be dismissed at the time of death and what remains 
should be sanitized. It is especially so, as was pointed out, when that person 
dies on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a hero. He was a gentle, kind and sincere man," wrote Carol Connors of 
Kirkwood, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
To point out otherwise was, as Bob Sheppard, the stentorian voice of Yankee 
Stadiun, wrote: "How unkind . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Obviously it was not "kind." The obligation of the newspaper in reporting or 
observing is not to be "kind." Neither was it unkind. Martin was not an 
individual whose passing could go unnoticed. He was a public figure of great 
dimension. What he accomplished and how he lived was a public matter just as 
that of a politician who might have been caught with a hand in the till. 
</P>
<P>
The fan somehow makes a separation between life and the toy department. "Of a 
hero, the people want to hear nothing but good," said Dr. Thomas Tutko, 
professor of psychology at San Jose State. "That phenomenon is multiplied in 
sports. Sports is even more hallowed than politics. Things that are regarded as 
bad in our society and really rotten in politics are regarded as clever in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
"When Richard Nixon was caught trying to steal the election, he was condemned; 
if Billy Martin had stolen the World Series the same way, he would have been 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin is seen as an institution, not as a man. His attacking (George) 
Steinbrenner seemed to be something we may not have had the guts to do with our 
own bosses. Authority has been screwing us and here was a guy fighting back." 
</P>
<P>
Surely that was so. Steinbrenner was such a dark figure of power that anybody 
who fought him appeared to be on the side of the angels. But don't forget the 
original line: "One's a born liar, the other's convicted" was said by a player 
about Martin and Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a very few people ever got to know Martin," Tutko said. "He'd cash in his 
mother to win a Series: In the United States today that's a highly-regarded 
characteristic. Winning here and now is the single most important thing, not 
where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
"What he had crystallized modern sports. It comes at the expense of other 
values -- being humanistic, being empathic, having the vulnerable side of 
yourself exposed." 
</P>
<P>
What that creates, Tutko said, is "winning-junkies." If their team is No. 1, 
then they can say "We're No. 1" and mean "I'm No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who does not agree, then is seen as prejudiced against. To be critical 
of Billy Martin's behavior or George Steinbrenner's behavior is really not to 
hate the Yankees; not being critical of them would be derelict -- or stupid. 
</P>
<P>
To then withhold that critical comment in retrospect, in obituary, would be 
irresponsible and misleading. Even dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"That people today have lionized Martin is a reflection of our society, which, 
as someone truly stated, is decadent indeed," John Scope of Hicksville, N.Y., 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Halliday of Manhattan phoned to say critical commentary was in order. 
"Some people think canonization comes automatically with death," he said. "Some 
people feel because a person dies on Christmas he was called specially. They 
didn't know him; they knew only that he won for them. He represented win at any 
cost. I knew him, and some of the things Billy did were criminal." 
</P>
<P>
The dangerous aspect of the Martin myth is that accepting his conduct on and 
off the field warps the boundaries of what's acceptable in a society that 
already accepts too much. He was a role model against civility. 
</P>
<P>
"As a role model to the youth of this country he was an embarrassment," wrote 
George Lasher, director of hockey at SUNY-Stony Brook. "... He was a superb 
manager and a man unable to control himself ... Billy Martin was an 
anachronism, a throwback to other times when hard drinking and hard living were 
part of the mystique. Thankfully these times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
To those who viewed him with eyes and ears covered, there is no intrusion of 
reality -- even to the later days when he was not a good manager anymore. 
"There's such madness in sports," Tutko said.

Muster is coming back after being seriously injured when hit by a drunk driver 
in an auto accident last April in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Muster twice broke Arias' serve in the final set en route to 
his first tournament victory since the career-threatening knee injury. He 
earned $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I wanted to give up, but I kept working," Muster said of 
his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, a former top 10 player whose ranking has dropped to 88th, made an 
increasing number of errors as the match progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Arias, whose last Grand Prix victory was in 1983, took a 3-0 lead in the third 
set and later was serving for a 4-1 lead. But Muster broke serve, then broke 
again in the 11th game before wrapping up the win. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain twice rallied from a set down to beat Richey 
Reneberg, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, in a $150,000 tournament at 
Wellington, N.Z. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in the 3 1/2-hour match was the 100th of Sanchez's career and his 
second in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday he teamed with his sister, Arantxa, to beat John McEnroe and Pam 
Shriver in the final of the Hopman Cup team event at Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet teen-ager Natalia Zvereva won her first tournament title by defeating 
Australia's Rachel McQuillan, 6-4, 6-0, in the final of the $150,000 Australian 
Hardcourt championships at Brisbane. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good feeling," said the 18-year-old Zvereva, six times a runner-up 
on the women's tour.

NCAA CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
SCHULTZ SEES NEED FOR MANY CHANGES

Calling for a "new model" on which to base college athletics, NCAA Executive 
Director Dick Schultz advocated a variety of sweeping changes, including 
granting tenure to coaches, Sunday night in an address to delegates at the 
opening of the NCAA convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I still maintain that the majority of things happening in college athletics 
are positive," Schultz told the convention, "but, regardless, we are what we 
are perceived to be. And, today, the general public, and even our faculties and 
deans, feel that colleges and universities are not doing a good job of 
controlling intercollegiate athletics. In other words, the model is not 
working. If this is the case, it's time to develop a new model." 
</P>
<P>
The convention, scheduled to run through Wednesday, offers a relatively tame 
set of proposals for the delegates' consideration. But Schultz's speech could 
spark a shift toward more radical proposals in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how exciting this convention is going to be," Al Witte, the 
University of Arkansas law professor who currently serves as NCAA president, 
said after Schultz's speech, "but '91 ought to be a blockbuster." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic part of Schultz's "model" was a call to "reduce 
pressure" on coaches by providing them with a tenure system comparable to that 
afforded faculty members. Schultz suggested that initial coaching contracts 
should be for five years with no termination except for violations of NCAA 
rules or ethical or moral reasons. After the five-year period, Schultz said, 
coaches should be granted tenure, given a one-year contract extension or be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Witte said he was "a little surprised" to hear Schultz advocate tenure for 
coaches, but said he supported the notion. "As a tenured member of a faculty, I 
know what the advantages are of job security," Witte said. "Maybe we could get 
more sense into the process if we did get them (coaches) security." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz also advocated sharply reducing off-campus recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"This solves a number of problems concurrently, such as many of the integrity 
issues as well as many cost-reduction concerns," he said. "It's absolutely 
ridiculous that we allow six, in-person off-campus visits (the present maximum 
for coaches visiting prospects). We hire presidents, commissioners, faculty and 
coaches with far fewer interviews. We need further restrictions on the number 
of coaching staff members allowed to travel, as well as shorter recruiting 
periods. . . . Let's put some dignity back in the way we conduct our business." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz went on to say that pressure must also be reduced on athletes by 
limiting demands on their time. He told the delegates he supports measures, 
some of which will be considered at this convention, to shorten seasons and 
practice time. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz addressed what he termed "other concerns regarding athletes" by 
advocating increased financial aid, an "emergency loan system for needy 
athletes" and an endowment fund that would provide small cash bonuses for 
athletes graduating within five years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Schultz suggested that college football and basketball 
underclassmen should be allowed to place their names in the professional drafts 
and evaluate subsequent financial offers without losing eligibility. "This also 
would reduce the efforts of the unscrupulous sports agent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Schultz said, an athlete recruited by a head coach who leaves the 
school before the athlete enrolls should be allowed to transfer without the 
usual penalty of sitting out a year. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz drew applause when he then added: "Let's also eliminate athletic dorms 
and the constant isolation of the athlete from the rest of the student body." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz dealt generally with the issue of how to spend the $1 billion that will 
be generated by the NCAA's new basketball contract with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"We should view these new dollars as a real opportunity to create major 
reform," he said. "Let's go back to playing for the trophy, eliminating the 
incentives to break rules because of dollars, and reduce pressure on both 
coaches and athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, who replaced Walter Byers as NCAA executive director 2 1/2 years ago, 
said later at a news conference that his speech included ideas he has 
formulated throughout his career as a coach and athletic administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I've been thinking about these things a long time," he said. "But 
two things made me think this was the right time (to speak out). First, the new 
(television) contract we received gives us an opportunity to make some changes, 
because that kind of event doesn't come along every day of the week. Second, 
you are what you are perceived to be. And if you read the polls and listen to 
the people around you, you know what the perception of us (college athletics) 
is. That tells you that change is needed -- not just window-dressing -- and 
that's what I hope to stimulate." 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Schultz said he does not advocate eliminating freshman 
eligibility altogether, but he asked the delegates to study the issue this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
As for Proposition 42, the controversial rule set to be implemented this year 
that denies scholarships to freshmen who fail to meet either the 
standardized-test or grade standards of Proposition 48 entrance requirements, 
Schultz told the delegates that he supports proposals in front of the 
convention that would modify or delay implementing the rule. He cited 
continuing studies by the testing services on the use of standardized tests in 
determining freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, taking part in a debate on freshman eligibility 
during last night's opening session, stated that all first-year athletes should 
be ineligible for competition but be allowed to participate in practice and 
conditioning sessions in a limited way. Under Young's plan, those athletes, 
provided they had met Proposition 48 entrance requirements, would then have 
four years of eligibility for competition. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he believes that athletes need the year off from competition to make 
the transition from high school to college work. 
</P>
<P>
He said his proposal is not just a "mandatory red-shirt year" because athletes 
who would be ineligible as freshmen under his proposal would not be allowed to 
travel with their teams or suit up for games. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he hopes that a proposal to make freshmen ineligible altogether will 
be considered at next year's convention in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Young's view was countered by Wake Forest President Thomas Hearn, who said: 
"Given the ills that prevail, freshman ineligibility is no panacea. Were 
freshmen to become ineligible, our athletic houses would not be in order, and 
some problems would certainly be made worse."

U.S. GOALKEEPER VANOLE IS A NO-SHOW AT SOCCER TRAINING CAMP IN LA JOLLA

Former UCLA goalkeeper David Vanole, who started three of the United States' 
eight qualifying games last year for soccer's 1990 World Cup, has been a 
no-show since the national team opened its training camp Friday in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know of David's decision is that I got a note here saying he's not 
pleased with the general situation and that he's not going to show up," Coach 
Bob Gansler said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would behoove him to make a call if he wants to give me or the 
administrators further explanation. He hasn't done that." 
</P>
<P>
Vanole, who lives in Manhattan Beach, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Another player, who did not want to be identified, said Vanole was unhappy with 
the standard player contract offered by the U.S. Soccer Federation because it 
does not provide insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Although Vanole is the only player who chose to hold out because of the 
insurance dispute, several other players have not signed contracts and have 
requested a meeting here during the two-week training camp with USSF President 
Werner Fricker. 
</P>
<P>
Vanole was the No. 1 goalkeeper until he lost the job after the fourth 
qualifying game to the University of Virginia's Tony Meola, who did not allow a 
goal in the remaining four games as the United States earned a berth in this 
summer's World Cup in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Four others are not among the 25 players here but have excused absences. 
Midfielder Hugo Perez and forward Peter Vermes are playing with teams in 
Europe, while Meola and midfielder John Harkes are trying out this week with an 
English team, Sheffield, on Wednesday. RANDY HARVEY

ARCHER ISN'T SATISFIED AFTER VICTORY;

<P>
SENIOR GOLF: HE WINS BY SEVEN STROKES, BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO BEAT THE PLAYERS 
ON THE REGULAR PGA TOUR.

George Archer's attempt to beat the kids fell far short Sunday, but he was 
never in danger of losing his firm grip on the senior division of the MONY 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
After a fast start Sunday on the long La Costa course, he ran into a bit of 
sour luck, settled for a two-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of five-under-par 
283. That was seven shots better than any other 50-and-older golfer. Bruce 
Crampton and Bobby Nichols tied for second at 290. Once again, the seniors 
started when the frost was still on the greens. Nichols was the only senior 
among the 20 who broke par in the last round. 
</P>
<P>
Archer tied the tournament record for widest victory margin, earned $37,500, 
became the youngest ever to win it and has won two of the six senior events 
since he became eligible Oct. 1. But he wasn't very happy. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he had promised, Archer, who began the final round with a commanding 
seven-shot lead, set his goal to beat most of the players on the regular PGA 
Tour. There were only five ahead of him going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
After he sank a 12-foot birdie on the second hole in the final round, Archer 
was eight under. He seemed to be playing as well as he did Saturday when he 
shot a 67. 
</P>
<P>
But by the margin of less than a foot, his hopes were doused on the fourth 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth is a 386-yard par- four, dogleg right with water on the right. 
Archer's drive was in perfect position for a shot at the flag, situated on the 
right side of the green. He hit a seven-iron right at the pin. He hit it a bit 
too thin. Instead of landing on top and rolling close to the hole, it hit in 
the bank. Slowly, the ball started rolling down the terrace, picked up speed on 
the cart patch and rolled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the shot, I said, 'OK, it's in the fringe and an easy par.' I was 
shocked when I learned it rolled into the water. That was the end, though I 
kept playing bold. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to win the senior event. But it's nothing compared to beating a 
majority of those juniors 20 years and more younger. Now that was my goal, and 
it blew up on the one shot. I really wanted to finish in the top five of the 
whole tournament. I may never get that chance again." 
</P>
<P>
Although his disappointment showed when he got the double bogey, he kept trying 
hard. He missed a tricky five-footer for a birdie on six, then sank a 45-footer 
on the eighth for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth is a 538-yard par five, with a ravine crossing the fairway 25 yards 
from the middle of the green. Most players lay up with their second shot. But 
Archer hit a long drive. His second shot hit in front of the ravine, bounced on 
the footbridge and into the rough on the left. It was a short pitch to the 
hole. But Archer left it a little short into the trap and his last hope 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"I know anything can happen in this crazy game," Archer said, "but I never 
thought about losing the tournament. It was the chance to beat the kids that 
fired me up for the last round. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not knocking the senior tour. It's great fun. But I don't think I have 
anything to prove. I won a Masters, I lasted 25 years on the tour despite 
physical problems. If Lee (Trevino) and Jack (Nicklaus) win all the tournaments 
this year, maybe I'll finish second. 
</P>
<P>
"But I sure did want to finish ahead of those kids." 
</P>
<P>
The only other time there was a seven-stroke margin was the first time the 
senior tour winners were invited to the tournament coinciding with the regular 
tour champions. Orville Moody won the 1984 event, finishing seven shots ahead 
of the late Dan Sikes. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, who had a blood pressure problems two weeks ago while hunting in Texas, 
had a 73 on the final round for a 301. He says he feels good in the morning but 
tires easily. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Miller Barber was far back at 296. Chi Chi Rodriguez and Al 
Geiberger tied for fourth at 292, four shots over par.

<P>
AMID BRUTALITY ALLEGATIONS, POLICE IN SAN DIEGO ARE USING AN ANCIENT ASIAN TOOL 
AS WEAPON IN SUBDUING SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the modern world of high-tech law-enforcement gadgetry, many police 
departments in Southern California are turning to an age-old East Asian farm 
tool to arm their officers in everyday encounters with uncooperative suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The nunchaku, a tool used generations ago by farm peasants to harvest rice by 
twisting it around stalks, has become the cutting-edge weapon for many police 
officers, including those wearing the uniform of the San Diego Police 
Department, the largest force in the nation to have added the weapon to its 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the nunchaku is gaining support with the San Diego street cop, 
especially among female officers facing much larger suspects, it also is 
prompting a new round of police-brutality complaints from the public, mostly 
resulting from extensive police use of the nunchaku in mass arrests of 
antiabortion demonstrators. Many law-enforcement observers believe the 
successes or failures of the nunchaku in San Diego could decide the future of 
this deceptively simple police weapon made of two 12-inch lengths of hard 
plastic connected by 4 inches of nylon cord. 
</P>
<P>
An officer carrying the nunchaku need merely wrap the cord around a suspect's 
wrist and, without much effort because of the leverage employed, can inflict 
enough pain to hold the suspect immobile until help arrives. The technique is 
similar to a number of other police techniques -- standard wrist holds, 
applying pressure to sensitive points -- in its use of pain, though perhaps not 
in the magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Maria Silveira believes the nunchaku helped her stop a "very 
intoxicated and hostile" woman from attempting to leap off the 250-foot-high 
San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a control hold on her right wrist and she got in the patrol car," the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
But those who have felt the nunchaku describe the extraordinary pain it can 
inflict. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Scofield, a nurse and antiabortion protester from Poway, said she 
suffered sprained wrists and hands and nerve damage to her thumbs and fingers. 
She was arrested with nunchakus at a demonstration in April and today, "I still 
can't hardly lift up a coffee cup," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous, excessive, brutal force," said the 41-year-old mother, who 
has filed a $250,000 claim against the City of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extreme pain. It's street torture. It's like if you intensified a bad 
tooth pain and an earache together." 
</P>
<P>
While the nunchaku has received its greatest attention in connection with 
antiabortion protests, the primary purpose of the device is to control and 
arrest suspects in ordinary street crime. Police say the weapon is particularly 
useful against people who are under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Most situations call for officers to use the weapon as a restraining device by 
wrapping the nylon cord around a limb. But it is also permitted for San Diego 
officers to swing the device in the air as an offensive martial-arts weapon. 
When it is, the nunchaku can extend from 14 inches to 28 inches in a flash, 
strike around corners and send disabling blows to a thigh or knee. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, a region with growing drug and gang problems, the 
nunchaku is gaining a strong foothold in several police departments. Officers 
in Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach are wearing the devices on their gun belts, and 
police officials in Oceanside, Tustin and Hawthorne are studying the tool. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department used the weapons experimentally in June to 
break up an antiabortion demonstration of 250 protesters, and now Sgt. Fred 
Nichols, the department's supervisor for physical training and self-defense, is 
preparing a proposal to his commanders for more exhaustive field tests with the 
hope that the department will eventually make them standard-issue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great, just great," said Nichols. "They're the best thing that ever 
happened. . . . We have heard nothing but accolades for this tool." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bob Burgreen, chief of police in San Diego: "All of our uniformed 
officers will be outfitted by June or July with these. And I think other police 
departments will follow shortly." 
</P>
<P>
As their popularity spreads, so grows the financial fortunes for Kevin Orcutt, 
a small-town police sergeant in Colorado and part-time bank security guard 
whose brother and father spend their days assembling nunchakus at home. 
Thirty-three years old and a police officer for 11 years, Orcutt sells the 
device for as much as $49.95, a price that includes a leather case. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hit upon the idea for his product -- which he calls the Orcutt 
Police Nunchaku -- in the late 1970s. Several officers in the Colorado Springs 
area sought the advice of Orcutt -- a black belt in Jukado karate -- on how to 
defend themselves against young gang members armed with nunchakus in imitation 
of Bruce Lee and his martial-arts movies. (Police say it is now a misdemeanor 
to possess nunchakus in Colorado and a felony to do so in California.) 
</P>
<P>
To fight back, Orcutt patented his own slimmed-down version of the nunchaku and 
produced a 12-ounce weapon that an officer can strap to the waist. Unlike the 
traditional police baton that can be bulky and clumsy and hard to handle, the 
nunchaku is a compact weapon that the officer would be less likely to leave 
behind in the car. 
</P>
<P>
Orcutt said his research has shown that the nunchaku was first fashioned as a 
farm tool in mainland China, and later turned up in Japan and, eventually, 
Okinawa. It is on that Japanese island, Orcutt said, that farm peasants 300 and 
400 years ago began deploying them as defensive weapons against their enemies. 
Bruce Lee popularized them in America. 
</P>
<P>
Orcutt said the weapon's prime advantage in "control holds" can save officers 
from back sprains and other serious injuries suffered while fighting 
uncooperative suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he sold his product to his own Thornton, Colo., police department. 
Several other small police forces in Colorado also bought the nunchaku and 
today, he said, about 45 police agencies in the country are using his 
nunchakus. He believes their success in Southern California ultimately will 
determine how far the device spreads across the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California agencies, even the whole state, is pretty well known for 
being progressive in the law enforcement field," Orcutt said. "And that's why I 
got onto a plane and went to California." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Don Fasching was coordinating the instruction of defensive tactics at the 
San Diego police academy last year when he learned of Orcutt's nunchaku and 
asked for a presentation. He then set up a demonstration for the chief and the 
top command staff. Chief Burgreen liked it, and the San Diego department began 
a four-month field testing program. 
</P>
<P>
The testing came to a halt even before it was completed. "It was so successful, 
three months was enough," Fasching said. 
</P>
<P>
Written evaluations from 40 officers were enough to sell the San Diego police 
hierarchy on the nunchaku. 
</P>
<P>
"As we began to place the suspect under arrest, he began to fight," wrote 
Officer Anne-Marie Hiskes, detailing how she gained control over a man refusing 
to leave a liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
"I used the chopstick technique to grab the wrist. I then gained control and 
tightened until he decided to comply with our commands." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Derek D. Diaz described applying nunchakus on a man during a domestic 
disturbance. "The subject was 6-foot-3, 200 pounds and went down easily," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Many law-enforcement agencies have not been as quick to embrace the nunchaku. 
Some police officials believe the tools remain largely untested, that they have 
the potential for inflicting greater injuries than the traditional police 
baton, and that legal liabilities may increase. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some police officials are satisfied with already-proven police 
pain-compliance techniques, such as come-along wrist holds and standard 
pressure points, for making difficult arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"None of it's been acceptable to us and none of it's even been considered," 
Sgt. Bob Takeshta, of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, said of the 
nunchaku. 
</P>
<P>
La Mesa Police Chief Bob Soto, who has supervised mass arrests at several 
antiabortion demonstrations, also refuses to equip his officers with the 
nunchaku. "We don't choose to use nunchakus any more than we would use an 
electronic stun gun," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation in Washington, said his 
law-enforcement think tank is waiting for more research on the nunchaku before 
issuing a recommendation on the new weapon. His main concerns are whether 
they're used improperly or too often, and whether other new weapons are more 
suitable for police work. 
</P>
<P>
"The New York Police Department has non-lethal devices including a high-spray 
water gun used to stun people," he said. "It's a quick shoot of this water and 
it can chill the person long enough to bring him down. It's almost like a fire 
extinguisher they carry in some of their car units. 
</P>
<P>
"They also have a shepherd's hook they use to hook around a person's foot to 
bring him down, and they have other restraining devices very similar to a 
straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
"All of these, if they're misused, can cause significant damage. And the 
nunchaku would not be significantly different." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Parsons, who runs an Appleton, Wis., consulting group for police 
training, favors a new expandable baton over the nunchaku. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things that work and we want to find what works the best," 
he said. "And nunchakus, if you're talking about thrashing rice, then that's 
when they work the best." 
</P>
<P>
Orcutt dismisses such criticism of his product, and says that other police 
weapons, such as the baton, the flashlight and the firearm, can be much more 
deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to hit someone with my OPN (Orcutt Police Nunchaku), you're 
going to hurt them," he said. "But not as badly as something else." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police officials have stood behind the nunchaku even in the face of a 
series of citizens complaints filed with the local police-community advisory 
board. The panel studied the weapon too, and it gave the police command staff a 
vote of confidence in defending the nunchaku. 
</P>
<P>
The group came to that conclusion even after an angry crowd of antiabortion 
demonstrators, many of them wearing arm slings and wrist bandages, jammed into 
a board meeting earlier this year and demanded that police stop using the 
nunchaku against peaceful demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Skorepa, chairwoman of the advisory panel, said she sympathized with the 
protesters, noting that she engaged in the Vietnam War demonstrations of the 
1960s and '70s. But she also worries about potential back sprains and other 
injuries to police officers forced to drag, lift and carry protesters who go 
limp in front of abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why adequate training has to be conducted along with constant 
monitoring," she said. "Just like the same thing has to occur with firearms. I 
mean, police are also issued guns and their orders are to shoot to kill. When 
they pull their guns, they can kill people."

SLANG: IT'S NO SECRET THAT BEING COOL IS IMPORTANT TO KIDS. TODAY'S "IN" WORD 
IS SIMPLY PART OF THEIR OWN UNIQUE ARGOT.

The children are acting up again. You hear them on the street corner, in the 
schoolyard, at the mall: "Hey, Yo! Yo, man, what's happenin'?" 
</P>
<P>
What is happening, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
What's with this "Yo" business, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
It depends on whom you ask. There is no shortage of pontificators on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
But a caution: Beware the opinions of assorted social policy experts, political 
types and ivory-tower intellectuals. Most of these good folk haven't a clue as 
to what's "Yo." Examples: 
</P>
<P>
* "A salutation among troubled inner-city youth reflecting membership in a 
pathologically deviant subculture." 
</P>
<P>
* "A solicitation used by drug dealers meaning, 'Open for business.' " 
</P>
<P>
* "A derogatory reference to black adolescents employed by suburban white 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
* "Anyone who carries a gun." 
</P>
<P>
* "Old south Philadelphia slang for 'Hello,' probably derived from the 
interrogatory, 'Yoo hoo!' Popularized by Sylvester Stallone in the first 
'Rocky' movie." 
</P>
<P>
* "A gangster or would-be gangster." 
</P>
<P>
These stereotypical adult responses remind me of those 1950s teen-ager movies 
in which some lavishly pubescent, elaborately hair-sprayed young ingenue 
manages to unglue her ear from the rock 'n' roll blaring from a transistor 
radio just long enough to announce, "Gee, this is really cool!" To which her 
mom replies, "Why don't you put on a sweater, dear?" 
</P>
<P>
Today the kids shout, "Yo!" and these same dense adults are thinking, "Oh my 
God, he's got a gun!" Or: "Thank goodness our little Throckmorton attends 
private school!" 
</P>
<P>
You want to know what's really happening? 
</P>
<P>
What's happening is the kids are yelling "Yo!" and doing a lot of ritualized 
palm-slapping and checking out the designer labels on each other's sneakers. 
And what they're thinking is: "Gee, this is really cool!" 
</P>
<P>
Being cool is very important to kids, dig? 
</P>
<P>
I checked this out with some, like, very heavy experts, and they've finally 
pulled my coat to what's "Yo." To wit: 
</P>
<P>
"Expressions like 'Yo!' belong to the specific language of the younger 
generation," says Richard Rowe, a program specialist in the Baltimore Mayor's 
Office of Youth and Children. "It's part of their adolescent rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever its derivation -- drug slang, the movies, 'rap' music -- the kids 
have made it their own," he says. "They pick it up from the streets or from 
watching music videos on TV. It's simply a language young people have developed 
to deal with each other, to make themselves a community." 
</P>
<P>
"All adolescent boys are 'Yo's'," agrees Bobbe Frasier, director of the Black 
Mental Health Center in West Baltimore. "It's what we used to call 'cool,' and 
what our parents called 'hip.' Today it's 'Yo.' Like 'rap' music, it talks 
about the children's aches and pains and what they see. It's also their 
commentary on the adult world." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference between today's young people and earlier generations of 
youthful rebels, says Frasier, is the context in which their coming of age 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the children of the post-civil rights, post-black nationalist eras, 
but many of them are growing up in decaying environments and poverty that 
affects their psychological development," Frasier says. 
</P>
<P>
"They experience a lot of stress because many of them live in highly stressful 
situations.So we find that many of them are reflecting a lower self-esteem, a 
lower sense of control over their lives, and (they) believe their destinies are 
in the hands of someone other than themselves," Frasier says. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe and Frasier see the obsession with symbols of material success among 
"yo-boys" and "yo-girls" -- designer clothes, gold jewelry -- as reflecting not 
only a normal adolescent desire to emulate adult status symbols, but also as 
indications of a deep insecurity, a need to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not only black kids who feel that way. A lot of white teen-agers are 
saying "Yo," too. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids today are subject to mass-market appeals," Frasier says. "They may be 
poor, but they still want things. Some get jobs so they can buy the things they 
want. And some get involved in criminal activity for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to think of adolescents as indolent, but in reality these kids are 
long on rugged individualism," Frasier adds. "They want to 'live large,' -- 
meaning the opulent life, the color TV, the nice car -- even if it's also a 
short life. Because all teen-agers, deep down, believe they are immortal." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe and Frasier blame the media for the negative stereotypes of "Yo-boys," 
especially those involving black male teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"If these kids were being told on a daily basis that they were winners, that 
they were loved, maybe they wouldn't have taken gang culture as their model," 
Rowe says. "Young men join gangs because they are not getting the sort of 
attention -- what psychologists call 'lap time' -- that they need. So they 
identify with that element in society that says 'you are important.' 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what this is about is that perhaps we as adults have not been there 
for our children like we should have," Frasier says. "We want to blame them for 
not having the values we want them to have. But the truth is, they are a 
reflection of what we ourselves are." 
</P>
<P>
So next time you hear a kid say, "Yo!" don't panic. He probably doesn't have a 
gun. Could be he's already in private school. The best thing might be just to 
tell him to put on a sweater. Because he's, like, "cool."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: INNER MAN STAYS IN THE CLOSET IN 'ROCK HUDSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Controversial celebrities don't merely die anymore. They go out, cameras 
blazing. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace's death showed that: First paparazzi-style media coverage that 
probably would have shocked even the prince of flamboyance himself, followed by 
the inevitable conflicting television biographies. In Liberace's case there 
were dueling "Chopsticks," a so-so movie on CBS trailing an awful one on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Are we through? Of course not, for now comes ABC's piece of the Rock. A sliver, 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42 is "Rock Hudson," two hours of 
Rockabilia that amount to little more than an extended footnote about the 
handsome Hollywood leading man whose private homosexuality became public 
knowledge near the end of his losing battle with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In limbo at NBC, meanwhile, is another Hudson script by the respected TV writer 
Carmen Culver based on Sara Davidson's authorized biography, "Rock Hudson: His 
Story." It appears that the fate of NBC's Hudson project will be determined by 
public response to the ABC movie. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson's former lover, Marc Christian, and former wife, Phyllis Gates, come off 
well in "Rock Hudson," which is not shocking given that both were major sources 
for the movie. The depiction of Hudson's longtime secretary, Mark Miller, is 
decidedly unflattering, however, showing him conspiring with the actor to keep 
Hudson's AIDS secret from Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Christian won a $5.5-million judgment against Hudson's estate and Miller for 
the "extreme emotional stress" he said he suffered after learning that Hudson 
had hidden his AIDS from him. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, meanwhile, has accused tonight's ABC movie of "promulgating and 
disseminating malicious and highly damaging lies." 
</P>
<P>
That remains to be seen. What can be seen immediately is that this movie, even 
if truthful, is a stale, flat, untextured monotone of a story that offers few 
insights into Hudson (who is played by Thomas Ian Griffith) and has the look of 
a rush job. Written by Dennis Turner and directed by John Nicolella, this is a 
movie for drive-by gawkers who get their history from 8x10 glossies, one that 
only superficially covers Hudson's life from age 21 to his death in 1985 at age 
58. 
</P>
<P>
We glide: Hudson meets agent Henry Willson (Andrew Robinson, who was ABC's 
Liberace). He gets into movies. He takes a male lover. He gets famous. He meets 
Gates (Daphne Ashbrook). He sleeps with Gates. He marries Gates when a magazine 
threatens to expose his homosexuality. She walks out when she learns he's gay. 
He's tormented. Willson hounds him about publicly hanging out with other gays. 
He buys a mansion, fires Willson and vows to "live the way I want to behind the 
gates of this big house." He meets Christian (William R. Moses). Christian 
moves in. Rock gets gray hair and a paunch. Rock learns he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
As far as "Rock Hudson" goes, the inner man remains hidden behind the gates. 
The definitive movie is yet to be made. This one is not shrill or titillating 
or homophobic, only unrevealing and uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
Given the difficult task of playing a star who has been chiseled into the 
American consciousness, Griffith is never very convincing as Hudson. He's tall 
and nice looking, but there it ends. Although his face does ultimately take on 
the look of a dying man, he still appears about 20 years younger than he is 
supposed to be as Hudson in his late 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is generally sympathetic to Hudson, but the betrayed Gates and 
Christian are its wounded parties as well. You want to feel sorry for Hudson, 
as much for his apparently painful life as for his painful death. But that 
sorrow is mitigated by the knowledge that -- if Christian and this movie are 
correct -- he deceived Christian about having AIDS while continuing to have sex 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
On that, the movie is emphatic. "I don't want anyone to know -- no one!" Hudson 
tells his secretary, Miller, after learning he has AIDS. Later, Miller tells 
Christian that Hudson has anorexia. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of man would use such a potentially lethal deception to victimize 
someone for whom he supposedly cared? Sorry, wrong movie. "Rock Hudson" hasn't 
a clue. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the movie is accurate in depicting Christian as a 
wide-eyed innocent, then he was either incredibly naive or incredibly thick. 
Given Hudson's physical deterioration amid an explosion of publicity about 
AIDS, ABC's account of a blindly trusting Christian seems far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the NBC movie -- if there is one -- may straighten that out. Rock 
Hudson, multiple choice.

COSTA-GAVRAS: WILLING PRISONER OF GREEK TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: HIS LATEST FILM, 'MUSIC BOX,' IS GREEK TO THE CORE. ITS HEROINE, LIKE 
ANTIGONE, HAS TO PAY FOR SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though he's lived in Paris since the age of 19, Greek-born director Constantin 
Costa-Gavras can't escape the tragic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the problem with Greeks," he says in heavily accented English. "There's 
this extraordinary weight behind us -- borne of the light, the landscape, the 
food, Mediterranean passions. It's a weight but also wings. It can go either 
way. My wings are made out of metal. They're very, very heavy." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have followed Costa-Gavras' 25-year career would tend to agree. "Z," 
Oscar winner for best foreign language film in 1969, dealt with an 
assassination in his homeland. "Special Section" focused on the infamy of the 
French Vichy regime during World War II. "Missing," the director's first 
English-language film, was based on a true story about a young American 
free-lance journalist who vanished during the 1973 overthrow of the Chilean 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Broad in scope and patently political, Costa-Gavras' work is light-years away 
from the farces and small, ironic films favored by so many of his French 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Box," which opened in Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto on Christmas 
Day and is scheduled for nationwide release Jan. 19, is also Greek to the core: 
the story of a lawyer (Jessica Lange) who, in the course of defending her 
Hungarian-born father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) against charges of Nazi war crimes, 
is confronted with a painful moral dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Antigone, she's an innocent who has to pay for something she didn't do," 
says Costa-Gavras, sipping black coffee in his Four Seasons Hotel suite. "She 
follows her father's destiny at the expense of her own. It's also a love story 
-- a look at a father-daughter relationship. Despite her passion to believe 
he's not guilty, the trial changes everything. The first man, the best man, in 
her life, she suspects, has betrayed her." 
</P>
<P>
Comparisons have been drawn between "Music Box" and "Betrayed," Costa-Gavras' 
1988 film about an FBI agent (Debra Winger) who falls in love with a seemingly 
ordinary man (Tom Berenger) who turns out to be a dangerous after-hours kingpin 
of a white-supremacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The human potential for violence is one of my recurring themes," he says. 
"That and the absolute necessity for justice and dignity in our lives. Human 
beings are a mystery . . . very, very, complicated. Natural mechanisms of life 
become perverted and become elements for oppression. You look at good people 
and discover a monster inside. That makes for good film making." 
</P>
<P>
Costa-Gavras and Joe Eszterhas, who also wrote "Betrayed," spent months going 
through transcripts of extradition trials, and found much of their inspiration 
for "Music Box" in the case of John Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland auto worker 
whom the Israelis accused of being a murderous guard at a Nazi war camp in 
Poland. Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel, convicted and is now under sentence 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd thought that all the old war criminals ended up in South America or, to a 
lesser degree, South Africa," says Costa-Gavras. "But the U.S. government let 
them in for industrial and scientific reasons. Wernher von Braun was one. Many 
were also part of a spy apparatus used to combat communism. 
</P>
<P>
"While the theatrical Nuremberg Trials were being conducted to show the world 
that the Allies were punishing Nazis, (Klaus) Barbie and hundreds of others 
were cooperating with the U.S. Secret Service. That was official policy. The 
interest of the nation-state took precedence. I find that kind of 'legal' crime 
much more insidious than the Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
Costa-Gavras considered casting Debra Winger in the lead of "Music Box," too. 
"But for ethnical reasons," he says with a laugh, "I decided it wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Though he had been following her career since "King Kong" days, Lange wasn't an 
obvious alternative. "This role was the furthest one from herself Jessica has 
ever played. 'Frances,' at least, was a glamorous person dealing in a fancy 
world. Here, she's a common everyday American woman -- not the pretty lady she 
is. She says she tried to be someone no one would look at a second time. 
They're also different on a psychological level. Jessica is private, emotional, 
very secret. On the set, she's alone a lot, protecting herself and her 
character. The character, on the other hand, is superrational." 
</P>
<P>
For the key role of Lange's father, Costa-Gavras wagered on Mueller-Stahl -- a 
firmly established European actor ("Lola" and the Academy Award-nominated 
"Colonel Redl") with no American profile to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of great American actors who could play someone in his late 
60s," says the director. "Jack Lemmon, Kirk Douglas, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner . 
. . I could go on. But they all have an 'image.' I didn't want the audience to 
say, 'Oh, Lemmon, he's a good guy all the way.' I was looking for someone 
abstract, a person whom the audience could discover through his gestures just 
who he is." 
</P>
<P>
Though the politically liberal director has had his differences with this 
country, the "Hollywood sensibility" infuses his films. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great admiration for American movies," he says. "All my generation in 
Europe was nourished by the good ones. We saw a lot of them after World War II. 
Most of them were made by immigrants, outsiders who wanted to be insiders -- 
people looking for home, the lost paradise, 'Rosebud.' That longing for a 
better world, I hope, finds its way into my films." 
</P>
<P>
Costa-Gavras also finds the "passions" in this country more conducive to his 
brand of film making. "Despite the extraordinary events of the past year, 
Europeans are probably a lot more cynical," he says. "When it comes down to it, 
they've seen too much. Their traditions are just too strong. 
</P>
<P>
"Armin (Mueller-Stahl) is so proud of his fellow Germans -- but when those 
thousands of Germans get together to demonstrate, they still stay off the 
grass. That's wonderful and scary at the same time. Eszterhas' script is, for 
me, the ideal American romantic point of view: people fighting for justice, 
even nastily, but for good reasons." 
</P>
<P>
And Costa-Gavras' mission in the $14-million film? Not finger-pointing or 
accusation, he insists, but keeping the issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a movie about memory," he says. "I don't have the right to 'forgive' 
since I didn't suffer personally or lose my mother or brother in the war. But I 
can insist that we remember. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, that's what this film is," he adds softly. "Just a small drop of 
memory."

Winds and currents are sweeping the remains of the oil slick that threatened 
Morocco's Atlantic coast out to sea, a government statement said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It said the slick that once stretched 185 miles has now broken into two smaller 
sections, with the closest being 30 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the 70,000-ton oil slick from the disabled Iranian supertanker 
Kharg 5 had drifted to within 10 miles of shore.

Sixth-grader Joey Stice, blond and freckle-faced, scrunches up his nose and 
frowns, wondering what to do with the colored construction paper in front of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
His teacher, Kate Halpin, has issued simple enough instructions: "Couvrez vos 
oreilles avec du papier bleu." 
</P>
<P>
Kartheek Nagappala, sitting across from Joey, immediately puts a sheet of blue 
paper over his ears, as do some of the other children who have caught on. Joey 
finally gets it and covers his ears, too. 
</P>
<P>
The pupils, some as young as 8, are in Halpin's after-school French class at 
Irvine's Brywood Elementary School. For an entire hour, they listen intently as 
red-headed Halpin runs about the classroom animatedly, asking her young charges 
to point to the clock, to hold up a yellow paper, to count to 20, to draw a red 
ball or to name the days of the week -- all in French. 
</P>
<P>
"Magnifique!" she says in approval. "C'est bon! C'est bon!" 
</P>
<P>
While other children might have gone straight from school to soccer practice, 
piano lessons or Boy Scout meetings, 289 young children in the Irvine Unified 
School District spent two afternoons a week last semester in classes such as 
Halpin's, learning another language. They are part of a growing trend in 
schools throughout the country to teach children as young as kindergarten age a 
foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
From Culver City to Detroit, parents and educators are recognizing that if 
America is to stay competitive in the world market, the ability to speak only 
English is no longer good enough. 
</P>
<P>
The language classes are not required fare in Irvine. In fact, the idea to 
offer the courses is entirely parent-driven and parent-funded. The district, 
however, has allowed the organizing group to offer the classes at 17 school 
campuses, most of the time using instructors who teach the language courses at 
area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, says Cindy Peronto, one of the parent-organizers, is that eventually 
the district will provide funding and help disprove a saying well-known in 
foreign language instruction circles: A trilingual person is someone who speaks 
three languages. A bilingual person speaks two languages. A monolingual person 
is an American. 
</P>
<P>
"We Americans are so behind the times," Peronto said. "It's foolish to think we 
can keep being a monolingual society if we want to compete in this world." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the second session of Irvine's pilot program gets under way. 
Peronto says enthusiasm for the courses has been so high that this time around 
Russian and Japanese are being added to a list of offerings that already 
includes Spanish, French, German, Latin and Chinese. The program also will 
offer a class in sign language. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't wait until high school before we begin to teach children foreign 
languages," she said. "It's amazing how fast these little ones learn and how 
eager they are to try to speak another language." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the children, some who have never had foreign language instruction, 
the lessons are mind-boggling. But in Halpin's class, pupils as young as third 
grade said they would rather spend their time learning to pronounce the nasal 
sounds of the French language than be somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to speak another language, especially Spanish, because 
there are so many Spanish-speaking people here," said Megan Crowley, a 
sixth-grader in Halpin's class. "French is another language I want to learn, 
and it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
The only time Halpin speaks to her pupils in English is at the beginning of the 
class, when she tells them to stand up and stretch to get rid of the day's 
weariness before they launch into the intense hour of foreign language 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, have we got our yah-yahs out now?" she asks them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the children in this class are sixth-graders, but the program allows 
for participants of any age. Some of Halpin's pupils have studied foreign 
languages before, especially those who have recently moved to the area from 
school districts outside of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so disappointed when we moved here from Chicago that the public 
schools don't offer foreign language in the elementary grades," said Vicki 
Chen, whose 8-year-old daughter, Ellen, is in Halpin's class. "In Chicago 
schools, it was compulsory. 
</P>
<P>
"After the age of 15, they say your tongue starts to be a little less 
flexible," she said. "I think the world is getting so small because of 
transportation advances and the media, that I want my children to take 
advantage of the cultural opportunities available to them." 
</P>
<P>
Her other daughter, Nicole, 11, has taken three years of German. "When we went 
to Europe, she translated for us," Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, the push for foreign language instruction is also receiving 
more attention. Last year, State Supt. of Schools Bill Honig published the 
Foreign Language Framework for kindergarten through 12th grade, which guides 
school districts toward more and earlier instruction. The aim is to make 
foreign language classes a state requirement at the elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
As California becomes more economically competitive with Pacific Rim and 
European nations, Honig said, "proficiency in another language is no longer a 
luxury, but a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign language is not being provided as part of the curriculum in the lower 
grades at any other Orange County school, so Irvine would be the first if 
parents can persuade board members that it is worth the time and effort. 
</P>
<P>
A group of parents in the Tustin Unified School District has been sponsoring a 
similar but much smaller after-school program for more than 20 years, but the 
district has not made the courses part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
At Brywood, Principal Stu Cunningham said Irvine's changing student population 
has magnified the need for multilingual instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Irvine is very much a salad bowl in terms of students from around the world," 
he said. "There are 57 different languages spoken in our district. There is a 
real need to make students aware of other languages spoken in our own community 
as well as to give them an entree to their careers later on." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham would like to see the program move into the school's curriculum. 
"You can always make time in the school day to add another program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For parents who worry that foreign language classes will get in the way of 
other subjects, there is a multitude of examples of districts throughout the 
state that have made a solid commitment to teaching children a foreign language 
while still maintaining academic achievement in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City school district has one of the oldest foreign language 
immersion programs in the country. Kindergarten pupils and first-graders in 
participating schools are taught entirely in Spanish and continue to receive a 
few hours of Spanish a day throughout the rest of their elementary school 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Madeline Ehrlich, founder of Advocates for Foreign Language Learning, the 
parent support group in Culver City, said her district's program has helped 
turn out children fluent in both English and Spanish and who do well 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
She said the program was controversial when it was started in 1971 because 
parents feared that children would fall behind in other subjects. But that fear 
has been largely overcome in her district, and she says it can happen in other 
schools, too. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of research that shows that if you're educated in English, you 
will be educated in Spanish, or another language," she said. "You only learn to 
read once. If you're a good reader in English, you will be a good reader in 
another language. If you're intelligent in Italian, you're intelligent in 
English." 
</P>
<P>
She said 47 school systems throughout the country offer immersion, or partial 
immersion programs for foreign language instruction. She called programs such 
as Irvine's, that offer only after-school and parent-funded programs, 
"half-baked." 
</P>
<P>
"You do not learn a foreign language by studying it 20 minutes a day," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peronto agrees with Erhlich that for the language classes to succeed, the 
district must show a commitment. But she says it has to begin with parent 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see it taught during school too," she said. "But my hope is that by 
having it after school first, the desire in the community will become so 
strong, and then parents will cry out and say, 'let's put some money into it.' 
"

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As authorities prepared Sunday to lodge murder charges against him, a former 
Garden Grove man who allegedly shot his ex-girlfriend to death and then set 
himself on fire over the weekend was given a "50-50" chance at survival. 
</P>
<P>
With third-degree burns over much of his body, 29-year-old Brian Keith 
Framstead was in "very critical condition" Sunday night in the burn unit of the 
San Bernardino County Medical Center after dousing himself with gasoline in his 
car near Victorville while police chased him, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police at the hospital kept a close watch on the only suspect in the grisly 
Friday night shooting in Huntington Beach of 19-year-old Tammie Marie Davis. 
Framstead's mother, meanwhile, waited with relatives in hopes of seeing her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors "told me I could see him because he could go either way," the mother 
said. Looking drawn and tired and sobbing occasionally, she eventually saw 
Framstead for a few minutes but refused comment on the bizarre series of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Warren Nobles of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said: "The 
doctors told us he had a 50-50 chance." 
</P>
<P>
Framstead's precarious physical condition took center stage Sunday as 
authorities in Orange and San Bernardino counties continued to try to piece 
together the weekend's sudden violence over a romance gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police believe that Framstead, upset with the breakup of his 
relationship with Davis nine months ago, had persistently harassed her and, 
late Friday, shot her to death on the 15200 block of Rushmoor Lane shortly 
after she had left a nearby Bob's Big Boy restaurant. She was a waitress there. 
</P>
<P>
Screaming, "Help me, help me!" Davis banged on a stranger's door just seconds 
before she was shot at close range. A shotgun thought to be the murder weapon 
later was found nearby in a flower bed. 
</P>
<P>
Framstead was reportedly under a court order to stay away from Davis and was to 
have begun a six-month jail term Sunday night in Theo Lacy Branch Jail for 
threatening her with a gun. Davis' brother said Framstead would not leave her 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
The two had lived together in a Garden Grove mobile home until last year, but 
the relationship was a stormy one with frequent fighting and yelling, neighbors 
and relatives said. The two had a 21-month-old daughter who police said is now 
staying with Davis' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Framstead's scheduled stint in jail "might have been what initiated" the 
shooting, Huntington Beach Police Lt. Ed McErlain said at a press conference 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Framstead set himself on fire Saturday night, police had identified 
him as the only suspect in Davis' slaying. But McErlain refused to say what 
physical evidence or testimony linked him to the crime, beyond the history of 
reported harassment. There are no known witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said murder charges are likely to be filed today after police consult 
with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
But homicide investigators have been unable to interview the suspect. 
Investigators traveled Saturday night to the San Bernardino hospital in hopes 
of talking with Framstead, but "he was not capable of speaking," McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
An occasional construction worker who was last known to be living in Inglewood, 
Framstead was first spotted after the killing on Wild Wash Road between Barstow 
and Victorville on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two rangers with the federal Bureau of Land Management wondered what 
Framstead's car was doing parked in the remote area and stopped to talk to him, 
according to Sgt. Jerry Wheeler of the California Highway Patrol's Victorville 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"Framstead told them everything was OK, nothing to worry about," Wheeler 
recounted. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a failure in the computer system, it was not until a few hours later 
that the agents found out that Framstead was wanted on suspicion of a fatal 
shooting in Huntington Beach. They then spotted him going south on Interstate 
15 and contacted the Highway Patrol, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers followed Framstead for a few minutes on the freeway near Victorville, 
as the suspect slowed down but refused to stop, eventually exiting at the 
Stoddard Wells off-ramp. He led officers around a Denny's parking lot and 
allegedly tried to ram one CHP car just before his own car burst into flames.

COUNTY DECISION DUE WEDNESDAY ON FIRE SPRINKLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of intense lobbying by home builders and fire officials, county 
supervisors are expected to consider Wednesday the controversial issue of 
whether automatic fire sprinkler systems should be required in all new homes in 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials say sprinklers are essential because they save lives by putting 
out fires before they spread. 
</P>
<P>
But home builders have been lobbying for a no vote. They say that sprinkler 
systems will make housing even more unaffordable and are unnecessary because 
new homes are already fire safe. 
</P>
<P>
It is an emotional issue because so many people die in fires -- 10 people 
killed in the county last year and more than 6,000 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Besides requiring sprinklers in all new single-family homes in the county, the 
proposed changes to the county's uniform building code also call for sprinklers 
to be installed in existing homes if enlarged by 50% or more, when that brings 
the total size to more than 3,600 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would also require fire sprinklers in all new multifamily 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Most builders agree that the impact of the proposed codes would be felt most in 
the South County, which has the largest expanses of unincorporated and 
undeveloped land. According to state Department of Finance estimates, Orange 
County is 60% built out, with much of the projected building activity through 
2020 expected in the southern and eastern parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We are lobbying in the interest of reason and the interest of safety," said 
Michael Lennon, director of community affairs for the Building Industry Assn. 
He said sprinklers would increase the cost of new homes in a housing market 
that is already very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors staff members told The Times that lobbying by developers, 
home builders, the Building Industry Assn. and fire officials has been intense 
since the proposed code changes were first made public last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a very serious issue, and I am not taking it lightly," 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has spent considerable time listening to the arguments from the 
Building Industry Assn. and developers, as well as from Larry J. Holms, county 
fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, the outgoing chairman of the board, said late last week that he was not 
sure how he or other supervisors would vote when the issue comes before the 
board Wednesday. But he said a compromise might be reached by requiring home 
builders at least to offer sprinkler systems to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Don R. Roth, who will take over as chairman this week, said: 
"There is no outcry from the public demanding fire sprinklers in all new 
single-family houses. The public is very, very complacent about this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Holms and county Fire Marshal William L. Wright said fire protection 
officials have failed to educate the public on the need of sprinklers in all 
buildings. That, they said, is the main reason for the complacency and lack of 
public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
The Building Industry Assn. said the cost to equip a new home with sprinklers 
reaches into the thousands of dollars, which might be enough to force even more 
people out of an already-unreachable housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon, the builder group's public affairs chief, said more than 85% of county 
residents can already no longer afford a new home at today's prices. 
</P>
<P>
Lennon said his organization -- which represents home builders, subcontractors 
and suppliers -- strongly supports the current California-wide building codes 
created by experts, including fire officials, which he said addresses all 
safety issues -- including fire. 
</P>
<P>
Those codes require smoke detectors, which, according to county statistics, 
have cut residential fire deaths in half. 
</P>
<P>
But Holms, who has been a firefighter for 30 years, said installation of 
automatic fire sprinkler systems in new homes is a safety issue that involves 
the very young, the very old and those who are incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
"My strong personal feelings about this issue have developed over many years -- 
and (during) the many times I have stood overlooking debris with families who 
have lost loved ones or all their personal belongings in a fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer I am in the business, the more personally committed I become. It is 
so needless. Why should a child die because it is in a crib or an older person 
because they can't walk or run?" 
</P>
<P>
Smoke detectors let you know there is a fire, he said, and sprinklers put the 
fire out. 
</P>
<P>
Holms said he understands the concerns of developers and builders, who are 
under pressure from all sides to add this and add that. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "my sympathy only goes so far." 
</P>
<P>
If the sprinkler systems were approved, Holms said, they would be included in 
about 60,000 homes from now until the county is fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
"That could make the lives of at least 180,000 people safer," he said. "We are 
talking about the kids of our kids." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the requirement could be cost effective, fire officials said. With 
sprinklers in enough homes, the need for fire protection could decrease. Each 
fire engine costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the price tag for each 
additional firefighter, benefits included, can reach $180,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a one-time cost to put sprinklers in a new home, but fire losses occur 
year after year," Fire Marshal Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
He said adding sprinklers in new homes would help "put a cap on fire protection 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Wright estimated that it costs about $2,000 to include a sprinkler system in a 
new home, which he said is a small sum when the average county house costs 
$238,000. 
</P>
<P>
It would cost about $3,000 to retrofit an older house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that additional cost would eventually be returned to the homeowner 
through lower insurance costs. More than 20 insurance companies offer premium 
reductions of 5% to 25% for homes equipped with automatic sprinkler systems, 
Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue over whether builders should be required to put sprinklers in new 
homes has been argued before. Supervisors put off deciding whether to require 
them in all new single-family homes in the unincorporated areas in 1987 because 
they said state and federal regulations were expected soon. These never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler systems are already required in all new family homes in San Clemente, 
Anaheim, Dana Point, Placentia, Cypress, Stanton and Seal Beach. Los Alamitos, 
according to fire officials, requires the systems in new homes because of 
water-pressure problems. 
</P>
<P>
A study of the last 82 years in Australia and New Zealand, cited by the League 
of California Cities, shows that 99.8% of the time, sprinklers controlled or 
extinguished structure fires. 
</P>
<P>
The league's report also pointed to Disney World-Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. 
Developed in the mid-1970s, the project provided the latest in fire protection, 
including sprinklers in every building of more than 1,000 square feet, smoke 
detectors, regular inspections of equipment and employee training programs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the league's report, the theme park, which has a daily population 
of 200,000 people, has had no fire injuries or fatalities, and its annual fire 
loss is less than $5,000.

DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH ALSO DIES OF INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drunk driver died early Sunday a day after he allegedly ran a red 
light and rammed his car broadside into another car, killing one person and 
injuring three others, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Fragoso, 25, of Paramount died of his injuries about 1:15 a.m. at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
He was admitted in critical condition Saturday with multiple fractures and head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1:45 a.m. Saturday at the intersection of Beach 
Boulevard and Imperial Highway when Fragoso's car struck a vehicle driven by 
Marvin Olsen, 50, of Orange, who was hurt in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Dead at the scene was Joseph Carillo, 34, of Long Beach, a passenger in 
Fragoso's car along with Mario M. Garcia, 36, who remains in critical condition 
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen and his passenger, Sherry Herring, 33, of Anaheim, were in stable 
condition Sunday at La Habra Community Hospital. Fragoso was arrested on 
suspicion of felony drunk driving.

PAY RAISE ISSUE ON CITY COUNCIL DOCKET

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members tonight will discuss whether to ask voters for their first 
pay raise in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, members receive $125 a month, contrasted with $300 paid to council 
members in Los Alamitos and some other Orange County cities, said Councilman 
Frank Laszlo. 
</P>
<P>
"Our salaries are the second lowest in the county," he said. "I think it's 
about time we had a raise." 
</P>
<P>
Under the city charter, the salaries may be increased only by a charter 
amendment approved by city voters. Laszlo, a councilman for nine years, has 
asked the council to put the proposal on the June primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed doing this in the past, but some of the council members 
expressed concern that some citizens might not approve the raise," Laszlo said. 
"The feedback I'm getting now is that most people think it's about time we 
tried it." MICHELLE NICOLOSI

Commercial development and resulting revenue will determine the future of 
Orange County's northernmost seaside city, Mayor Victor S. Grgas says. 
</P>
<P>
"The next year can be a very rosy one if the revenue streams we're relying on 
come to fruition. If not, it's going to be a very tight economic situation 
(and) we may have to defer projects that need to be done," Grgas said. 
</P>
<P>
Grgas said the prime unknown is the Mola Development Co. residential project 
planned for the Hellman Ranch Property in northwest Seal Beach. If approved, 
the project would bring the city about $800,000 annually over the next 20 years 
in redevelopment funds as well as the $1 million the company has agreed to pay 
the city if the California Coastal Commission approves the project. 
</P>
<P>
Although these amounts wouldn't make much of a difference in most cities, the 
prospective revenue from the Mola project will determine whether Seal Beach 
residents will fast or feast in the coming years, Grgas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seal Beach is a true bedroom community," he said. "It doesn't have a lot of 
its tax base coming from retail or industry. A lot of things have to be done 
soon, and it's going to be expensive. That money has either got to come out of 
our pockets or from something like Mola." 
</P>
<P>
Grgas said two of the most expensive items on his agenda are a sand 
replenishment project for the beach and an overdue restoration and extension of 
the concrete barrier wall under the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, without Mola we don't have the money for these projects," Grgas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach operates on a yearly budget of $14 million with a $1-million reserve 
and is ineligible for most state and federal grants because of the affluence of 
its residents, Grgas said. 
</P>
<P>
Other upcoming projects include public hearings on a proposed Bixby Co. 
development on property across the street from Rossmoor Shopping Center. The 
project's plans include retail, office and residential uses. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

PLAN SHELVED TO ADD LANE TO LAMBERT ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to add third lanes on both sides of Lambert Road between Palm Street and 
the eastern city limits were temporarily shelved to give property owners time 
to find alternatives for curbside parking they would lose. 
</P>
<P>
The city Traffic Commission recommended the new lanes along with prohibitions 
for stopping or parking. But the City Council, after hearing from several 
property owners and business operators, voted to move forward only with plans 
to widen the pavement in spots and install curbs and gutters. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lee Risner told the council that the additional lanes will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, traffic is going to require that this be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Zaratzian, owner of property in the 2100 block of Lambert, objected to 
the prohibition on parking. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to destroy a number of businesses that have been in La Habra for 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Overby of Overby Transportation suggested the widening might only create 
a bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see where we're going to get a significant improvement in traffic 
flow," he said. "Unless the road is made three lanes all the way through town, 
I just don't see the benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Spear, operator of In-N-Out Burger on Lambert, said: "We enjoy parking 
for five or six cars along the street. If those spaces are eliminated, our 
problem will be exacerbated. The walk-up customers (who use the street parking) 
will get in line at the drive-through, sometimes extending into the street." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Douglas Bystry voted in favor of the motion, but expressed 
reservations it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be beneficial unless it affects the entire street," he 
said. "What we're going to have is sort of a hodgepodge of widening and then 
going back to two lanes and that can be worse, really." 
</P>
<P>
Risner invited property owners to meet with city officials to develop 
alternatives. He also offered to assemble experts on planning and traffic to 
work with property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The council will reconsider the matter in six months. DAVID F. BURKE

'FOLLOW THROUGH' IN 1990, MAYOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Familiar topics of the past decade -- open space, affordable housing, child 
care, growth and transportation -- will again be prominent in the business of 
this 18-year-old city in 1990, according to Mayor Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
But another familiar phrase, "follow through," will be a high priority, Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to have lofty goals, but it's another thing to follow through 
on projects to achieve those goals," said Agran, a six-year mayor who will face 
reelection in June. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's City Council made headlines in the 1980s by adopting landmark 
ordinances in the fields of environmental protection, recycling and open space. 
This year will serve as a checkpoint on the success of those ordinances, Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By spring, the mayor says, the city will be able to measure a significant 
reduction of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances in the 
atmosphere, as demanded in Irvine's environmental protection ordinance adopted 
last summer. Businesses that do not meet the standards will "answer to the 
city. But I think we should be able to document substantial progress," Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's curbside recycling program, which has become a model for other South 
County cities, will also be stepped up, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 70% of our households are currently involved, and we plan to bring 
in additional households and the commercial sector of the city in 1990," Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two major development projects, parts of the villages of Westpark and 
Northwood, will come to the City Council in the spring and summer, 
respectively. Together they will add nearly 7,000 dwelling units to the city 
and will be closely scrutinized, Agran said. "Our principal concerns with these 
projects are possible adverse traffic impacts," he said. "We'll look to see 
what are the mitigating provisions." 
</P>
<P>
Linked to all development in Irvine is dedication of open space, according to a 
city ordinance adopted in 1989. A total of 17,000 acres of open space is the 
goal of that ordinance and each development considered by the council will 
include provisions toward that goal, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
When the housing element of the city's general plan comes to the council in 
March or April, Agran hopes to restate his commitment to affordable housing so 
city employees, schoolteachers, retail clerks and "all the people who make a 
city work can afford to live here," Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
That also goes for affordability in child care, another council commitment. The 
council has adopted a goal of making affordable child care available to every 
family who lives and works in Irvine who desires it by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A $57-million park bond issue will go before Irvine voters March 6 with the 
blessing of Agran and the City Council. It asks each household for up to $120 a 
year and needs a two-thirds' majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Agran also listed the opening of the Irvine Theatre in late fall, the first 
meeting of the city's new cultural affairs commission in January and the 
opening of the Amtrak station in the city's new transportation center in the 
Irvine Spectrum area as landmark events for 1990. LEN HALL

CAMPAIGN PROMISES TO BE QUICK AND DIRTY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: WITH LESS THAN A MONTH LEFT IN BATTLE OVER WILLIAM CAMPBELL'S VACATED 
STATE SENATE SEAT, CANDIDATES DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE TIME TO FORM ISSUES. THAT 
LEAVES MUDSLINGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the prospect of a charged debate over ethics and abortion in a short 
five-week campaign, the special election to replace former state Sen. William 
Campbell truly promises to be quick and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they were going to sling so much mud so fast," said Sal Russo, 
a political consultant for Assemblyman Frank Hill, the candidate who so far has 
drawn most of the dirt. "It started right away." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian decided just before the holidays to set the special 
primary for Feb. 6, in part so that Republican assembly members could run 
without risking their seats in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
Hill (R-Whittier) and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) are among 
eight candidates running for the predominantly Republican district that 
straddles the Los Angeles and Orange County border. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates waited until the New Year and then launched a mad five-week dash 
last Tuesday. So far, almost every day has involved accusations and 
name-calling. Candidates have criticized both Hill and Ferguson for accepting 
what their opponents say are excessive honorariums, and last week Hill was 
attacked by three candidates for mailing a letter that they said implied he was 
endorsed by Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, first elected to the 31st Senate District from Hacienda Heights in 
1976, resigned last month to become president of the California Manufacturers 
Assn. He has told the candidates that his contract prevents him from endorsing 
a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the major factors expected to influence the race are: 
</P>
<P>
* Pro-choice forces that are hoping to turn the campaign into a repeat of 
California's last two special elections, in which their candidates upset 
anti-abortion opponents. This race has some of the same dynamics, with a 
pro-choice Republican encouraging Democratic crossovers and two anti-abortion 
Republicans who could split their constituency. 
</P>
<P>
* An ongoing FBI investigation of Hill involving an influence-peddling scandal 
at the Capitol. Hill, meanwhile, has been the prime target of the other 
candidates because he appears to be the best financed and he has the backing of 
Republican leaders in the Assembly and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
* The heavy negative campaigning that is likely to limit the discussion of 
issues and discourage voters in an election that was already expected to have a 
low turnout of about 20%. The shortness of the race and the presence of some 
little-known candidates have contributed to the attacks, since it is easier to 
sully an opponent than it is to sell an unknown candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The district stretches from Whittier and West Covina in Los Angeles County to 
Laguna Beach in southern Orange County. Its registration is solidly Republican, 
about 60% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight candidates who filed on Dec. 26, only Hill and Ferguson have 
served in the Legislature. But Ron Isles, a city councilman from Brea, has been 
included among the leaders because of his claim that he will spend up to 
$500,000 of his own money on the campaign, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, a consultant who sold his electronics manufacturing company in 1981, is 
also a pro-choice Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates are Republican Gary C. Miller, a city councilman from 
Diamond Bar; Democrat Bradley J. McFadden, a councilman from West Covina; 
Janice L. Graham, secretary of the Orange County Democratic Party; Thomas M. 
Whaling, a Democratic attorney from El Toro, and Robert W. Lewis of Rowland 
Heights, who filed for the race with the American Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote on Feb. 6, a runoff between 
the top Republican and Democratic vote-getters will be held April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he is counting on a strong showing in Orange County to win the 
race, since 60% of the Republican voters in the district are on his side of the 
county line. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he expects to have less money -- about $350,000 -- than either 
Hill or Isles. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of running a negative campaign, Ferguson said, he will stress his 
background as a family man who has worked in business, served in the military 
and has won three terms in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Hill said he hopes to campaign on his accomplishments during eight 
years in the Assembly and on his "reputation for getting things done in 
Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
And he said his geographic base is stronger than Ferguson's because half of the 
population in the Senate district is within the boundaries of his Assembly 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' campaign is counting on the race becoming topsy-turvy with a groundswell 
of voters turning out either because of the ethics issue or abortion, two of 
the hottest political subjects of the 1990 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Isles has repeatedly attacked Hill and Ferguson, charging that they have been 
unethical in office. Most often he has criticized Hill for being a subject of 
the FBI's Capitol sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been accused in court testimony during the corruption trial of state 
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) of accepting a $5,000 honorarium in return 
for his support of legislation for a shrimp company. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done anything wrong," Hill said Friday. "I know as much about the 
investigation as anybody who reads the papers." 
</P>
<P>
Hill also said he does not know how the investigation will affect his race. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Miller blasted Hill for the FBI investigation saying: "Frank Hill 
has no ethics. He is trying to deceive the voters . . . that is arrogance 
personified." 
</P>
<P>
Hill charged in response that Miller has not voted in several past elections. 
</P>
<P>
Isles was endorsed Friday by Pro-Choice Orange County, a bipartisan 
organization that was formed in response to the Supreme Court's Webster 
decision in July, which gave states more authority to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The California Abortion Rights Action League in Santa Monica has also endorsed 
Isles. The league campaigned for Tricia Hunter and Lucy Killea in their upset 
special election victories last October and December, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups plan to provide volunteers and phone banks for Isles' candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Schwartz, a Democrat and president of Pro-Choice Orange County, said she 
expects Democrats to vote for Isles because of his pro-choice position on 
abortion and the likelihood of a Republican winner, the same incentives that 
were followed in Hunter's race. 
</P>
<P>
"This race will be the beginning," Schwartz said. "This is the beginning of 
turning around the Orange County legislators." 
</P>
<P>
The spoiler for Isles' scenario, however, may be Graham. She is the Democrat 
who ran against Campbell in 1988 and she has the potential to prevent the 
Democratic vote from breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Ferguson said recently, "The happiest day of my life was when Mrs. 
Graham entered the race." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates believe that nobody will get more than 50% of the vote 
and that, as a result, there will be a runoff between the leading Republican 
and Democrat. That's where Graham expects to win.

COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT SEEKS 'USER FEES'; 
</P>
<P>
CRISIS RESPONSE: SERVICE CHARGES WOULD RAISE $4.2 MILLION YEARLY TO HELP KEEP 
PACE WITH EMERGENCIES, A REPORT SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
To keep pace with Orange County's booming population, the County Fire 
Department hopes to start charging for services ranging from reviving residents 
from death's door to responding to false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "user fees" would raise an additional $4.2 million a year, 
according to a just-finished department report. The fees are expected to help 
county firefighters grapple with the increasing number of residents they serve, 
which has soared from 390,000 to 800,000 over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
The County Fire Department is responsible for fighting fires in unincorporated 
areas as well as in 13 cities within the county that pay for the service. The 
proposed fees would ensure that the county can continue to respond quickly to 
emergencies in those areas, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary if we want to continue our current response time of 
five minutes or less on 85% of our calls," Assistant Fire Chief Robert H. 
Hennessey said. "It's extremely critical. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Those who would be subject to a variety of new user fees include residents and 
businesses in Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Mission 
Viejo, Placentia, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, Stanton, Tustin, Villa Park 
and Yorba Linda, along with those in the county's unincorporated areas. The 
fees are expected to be approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors. The 
proposed charges must then be approved by each city council before they may be 
imposed. Under current plans, the fees would take effect in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and businesses would be given the option of paying a yearly user 
fee, similar to an insurance premium, that would cover the cost of any 
paramedic care provided to them. Those declining to pay the yearly user fee 
would be charged for each instance of emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current proposal, for example, each household would pay a yearly 
subscription rate of $30 to $45. Residents who decline the yearly fee would be 
charged $150 to $250 -- depending on the extent of the care -- each time the 
county dispatched paramedics to their address. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the fee would probably be applied on a sliding scale to 
lower-income residents, although details have yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Households or businesses with faulty equipment causing more than two false 
alarms in a month or three false alarms in six months would also be charged a 
service fee. Businesses that require repeated inspections because of failure to 
comply with fire codes would be charged for repeat visits. 
</P>
<P>
The fee proposals are part of a major restructuring of the department, the 
first reorganization since the county took over responsibility for fire safety 
from the state in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"With no guaranteed funding level from one year to the next, it has become 
increasingly difficult for department management to maintain vital programs. . 
. ," a department report on the reorganization said. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly draining on resources is burgeoning South County, where 
inspections for new homes have grown by 25% in the last five years, the report 
said, adding that no end is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The South County is expected to continue to grow at a rate of 15% to 20% for 
the next five years and population for the region is expected to climb to 
395,000 by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the task of firefighting in South County are the dense pockets of 
housing, their proximity to forests and other wild, unpopulated areas and the 
lack of major, direct highways to housing developments, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The department proposes creating a new seventh battalion for South County and 
hiring three new battalion chiefs for the region. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that numerous other localities, including some in Southern 
California, now rely on user fees to defray the costs of firefighting. Anaheim, 
Buena Park, Garden Grove, Fullerton, Huntington Beach and Orange charge a 
variety of user fees for emergency services, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rejected user fees for paramedic 
care after cities there objected to the proposal last year, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
In numerous cities, the report said, there have been "no legal difficulties or 
public resistance" to user fees.

A Mormon missionary from Laguna Niguel is missing and presumed dead after the 
boat in which he was riding on Lake Atitlan last week capsized, church 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Adam Leach, 19, traveled from Orange County to Guatemala last 
last week to aid in the search for the young missionary, but without success, 
according to Don Sedgwick, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints' local district. 
</P>
<P>
"They are obviously concerned as any family would be," Sedgwick said. "They're 
hopeful that he may still be alive, but that hope diminishes each day." 
</P>
<P>
Also presumed dead in the boating accident is Brian Bartholomew, 20, of 
Modesto, said Don LeFevre.

UC Irvine took its shot-in-the-dark act on the road Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And the cold-shooting Anteaters fared no better than they have at home, losing 
to Fresno State, 67-57, before 9,796 at Selland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters entered the game shooting 43% from the field, and hadn't been 
above 40% in the past three games. And when it seemed as if the Anteaters 
couldn't shoot much worse, they do. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (2-10 overall, 0-3 in Big West Conference) made 16 of 51 field goals for 
a season-low 31.4%. The Anteaters were a woeful six of 22 (27.3%) in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Fresno (6-6, 1-2) shot 51.2% from the field, including 55.6% from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
And on a night when Irvine seemed to play well enough otherwise, the Anteaters 
suffered their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win the way we're shooting," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. "Their 
defense made it tough for us to get into our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing all manner of shots -- layups, short jumpers and three-pointers 
to name a few -- Irvine actually had a good chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters didn't let Fresno run away, trailing 31-26 at halftime. Irvine 
took the lead 4:05 into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in big trouble tonight, there's no question about that," Fresno Coach 
Ron Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters couldn't break away either, as Fresno's chest-to-chest defense 
kept the Bulldogs close. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest lead Irvine could muster was 39-35 after Ricky Butler's basket with 
13:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bulldogs' Tod Bernard made a jumper from inside the three-point line 
with 7:53 left, Fresno had tied the score, 47-47. 
</P>
<P>
About then, Irvine hit the skids. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we all got tired at the same time," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Irvine seemed to be moving in slow motion in the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-4 run by the Bulldogs, in which Bernard had seven of his 20 points, put 
the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest basket was a hurried-looking, 22-foot three-pointer that pushed 
Fresno's lead to 55-50. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riddlesprigger added 18 points, making 12 of 16 free throws, and Wilbert 
Hooker had 12 for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman led Irvine with 20 points, but he made only five of 18 shots. 
Butler, who made five of eight shots and was the only Irvine player to shoot 
better than 50%, scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing well right now," Mulligan said. "It's just a tough year." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was chance for a victory with seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"They were giving us the game," Herdman said. "It was our game. We should have 
won." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Irvine plays at the University of the Pacific Tuesday. "We're 19-0 against 
Pacific since I've been at UCI," Coach Bill Mulligan said. "Happy new year."

TAIWAN HOPES TO TRANSLATE WEALTH INTO WORLD CLOUT

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Money does talk. Or so Taiwan hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Like a rich kid new in school, Taiwan is using its new-found wealth to win 
friends -- and widen an international role that was sharply curbed after the 
world moved to recognize the mainland Communists as China's legitimate 
government instead. 
</P>
<P>
The little island has amassed a big bank account -- $73 billion in foreign 
reserves -- mainly from a spectacular export performance that has boosted it to 
the world's 13th-largest trading nation. So now it is trying to rejoin the 
world's premier trade organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
It has opened a $1.2-billion economic development fund for "friendly nations." 
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has stashed $4 billion into a new loan market for banks, 
hoping to position Taipei as Asia's premier financial center next to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
And officials from the Republic of China on Taiwan have dropped broad hints 
that it would be willing to help lift the crushing Third World debt burden if 
they could get more than a pat on the head for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of our economic power, our trading power and our financial power, the 
ROC is justified and entitled to be involved in international economic 
organizations and international affairs," said Samuel Shieh, governor of the 
Central Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials deride Taiwan's strategy as "dollar diplomacy" and have 
strenuously protested its use. But the small developing countries that have 
restored relations with Taiwan have nothing against money. They want it. Taiwan 
has it. China doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's generous aid at an appropriate moment goes far beyond our economic 
ties with Beijing," a Taiwan newspaper quoted an official from Belize as 
saying. The Caribbean nation was one of four -- the Bahamas, Liberia and 
Grenada were the others -- that restored diplomatic ties with Taiwan this year. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. officials, in Congress and the Administration, are also sympathetic 
to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, their economic power is increasing their standing in the world," said 
one U.S. official, who asked for anonymity. "They have earned respect. I think 
international organizations are looking for ways to have Taiwan participate 
without antagonizing China." 
</P>
<P>
But China is antagonized. The country opposes Taiwan's entry into GATT and 
quickly suspended relations with Liberia, Grenada and Belize after they 
recognized Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has used its dollar policy to lure some countries into establishing 
diplomatic relations in an attempt to bring about dual recognition, to create 
two Chinas," said Ye Dabo, press officer with the Chinese consulate in Los 
Angeles. "This is not in the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan 
Straits, because people on both sides want to have reunification of their 
country. China can only express great regret." 
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars are also concerned about the impact of Taiwan's new 
aggressiveness on U.S. business interests. 
</P>
<P>
"The more aggressive Taiwan gets, the more aggressive Beijing gets, the more 
Taiwan's economic partners will be put into that trap . . . (of) choosing 
between the PRC and Taiwan," said Anthony J. Kane, director of the Asia 
Society's China Council. "Businessmen don't like to have to worry about these 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, they haven't had to. In 1979, the United States switched 
recognition to mainland China, following a global trend that began when the 
United Nations recognized the mainland with a seat in 1971. Taiwan lost its 
GATT seat and membership in other international bodies and focused instead on 
building non-official trade ties. 
</P>
<P>
But two things have changed to help turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
First, Taiwan's riches have given it new bargaining leverage. During the past 
40 years, Taiwan has transformed itself from an agrarian society to a 
manufacturing giant whose people's average individual income has grown to 
$7,500 from $300 in 1950. Thanks to its export success, it has amassed foreign 
reserves second only to Japan at $73 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan's own reserve needs amount to only $20 billion, Shieh said, the 
remaining billions amount to a lot of money for a lot of projects that could 
win a lot of friends. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, has adopted a new flexibility that 
makes closer ties with more countries easier. In the past, Taiwan's ruling 
Kuomintang party had insisted that it would not deal with any country that 
recognized the mainland regime instead of the Nationalists on Taiwan as China's 
legal government. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, Lee signaled a change when he agreed to visit Singapore, a 
country with which it has no diplomatic relations, and stomached being called 
the "president of Taiwan" in the newspapers. Since then, Taiwan has been more 
willing to participate in international affairs under different names -- it 
used "Chinese-Taipei" in the 1988 Olympics -- and to deal with countries 
regardless of their relationship with China, said Bertrand Tsai, who heads 
National Taiwan University's political-science department. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to win more friends in the world, we had to take a more pragmatic 
diplomatic position," said Y. C. Chen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Taiwan has handed out millions of dollars in low- or no-interest 
loans, as well as pledges of technical assistance. For Grenada, $10 million. 
For Liberia, $200 million over several years. For Costa Rica and Panama, about 
$9 million apiece to help them set up export-processing zones. 
</P>
<P>
As of November, 22 countries had applied for loans from Taiwan's new 
$1.2-billion fund, called the Overseas Economic Cooperation and Development 
Fund. Five had been accepted, and 14 rejected on the grounds that no diplomatic 
ties existed or because the applications were incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Officials object to Beijing's blast that they are "buying" friends. "This kind 
of relationship is based on mutual benefit," Chen said. "It's very common in 
the world. The U.S., Japan, always grant assistance to friendly countries." 
</P>
<P>
But promoting relations with tiny countries is hardly Taiwan's ultimate goal. 
While the diplomatic breakthroughs with the four nations this year provided a 
morale boost, their populations combined are smaller than that of Los Angeles. 
A far juicier prize, in Taiwan's view, is membership in the world's premier 
economic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Taiwan is setting its sights on GATT. As a major trading nation, 
Taiwan officials said, it is only fair that they sit at the table where rules 
governing 80% of world trade are made. Commercial disputes are also mediated 
through GATT, which Taiwan would prefer to the bilateral process it now must 
follow. And Taiwan would like to take advantage of GATT members' lower tariffs, 
not to mention the official status as a world player that GATT membership would 
confer on it. 
</P>
<P>
To placate the mainland, U.S. officials suggest Taiwan could join as a "customs 
territory." Other sticky points are what to call Taiwan and whether to accept 
it before mainland China, whose GATT application is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the world traders, officials say that support of Taiwan's GATT application 
could persuade the republic to help out on Third World debt problems. With such 
incentives, Taiwan would consider setting up a special lending window through 
the International Monetary Fund or World Bank for debt relief or economic 
recovery programs, Shieh said. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly speaking, we have to consider to some extent the political and 
economic gain for our participation," Shieh said. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai added: "People want to use the resources to improve the environment, 
transportation problems, improve social welfare. We cannot use the money for 
nothing."

FOOTNOTES: WE WILL NAME NO WINE... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alcoholic beverage business, beset by declining sales, has found comfort in 
the notion that while Americans may be drinking less, they are trading up and 
"drinking better." And nowhere has this boast gained greater currency than in 
California's wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
After all, while sales of generic wines -- blends derived from grapes of 
undisclosed parentage and often sold in jugs and bulk dispensers -- are 
declining, more costly varietal wines are being consumed. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, asks Paul Gillette, publisher of the oft-contrarian Wine Investor 
newsletter in Los Angeles, isn't this something of a name game? Gillette 
observed that, among other industry changes, Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi 
Winery decided, for marketing reasons, to print the leading grape varieties 
used to produce what had been called Robert Mondavi Red and Robert Mondavi 
White, now known, at higher price, as California Cabernet and California 
Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
"Voila," observed Gillette, "suddenly one-plus million cases of generics have 
become varietals." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't, mind you, begrudge the success of the producers," he continued. "All 
we're saying is that we hope you don't . . . conclude that the biz in classic 
mid-range and high-end varietals is booming." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette's own conclusion, detailed in a new report on the U.S. premium wine 
market available from Wine Investor: "If there's a stampede, it is to varietal 
names." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Playing Games With Training 
</P>
<P>
Some people really win at corporate game playing. 
</P>
<P>
Newtowne Productions in Redmond, Wash., designs customized board games that 
companies use for training or promotion, including Ad-Wise for the Broadway, 
Smart Moves for Smart &amp; Final and Pic 'n Play for Pic 'n Save. 
</P>
<P>
Newtowne, run by Tim and Kim Villeneuve, both designs the games and offers 
training consultation and analysis. Kim, who previously was a vice president 
for training at Carter Hawley Hale and ran an employee training program for 
Northrop, provides the instructional theories and techniques, while Tim, a 
graphic artist, puts together the games. 
</P>
<P>
"Most traditional training programs for companies are boring," Kim says. 
"They're basically ineffective and insult the intelligence of employees." 
</P>
<P>
Newtowne's games seem to capture some fans. Tim notes that after Smart &amp; 
Final's initial order of 20 games, so many executives wanted their own copies 
that the company ordered another 150 sets. 
</P>
<P>
So how much does all this corporate fun cost? Prices vary, but an average for 
all services and 20 game sets is about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
No Monoply money, please.

4TH QUARTER MOSTLY WEAK FOR JUNK BONDS

Corporate high-yield junk bonds posted a loss of 2.53% in the fourth quarter of 
1989, their weakest performance in five years, according to a report from 
Salomon Bros. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon said the market's softness, which began in late summer, culminated with 
a selloff in October, as investors were rocked by a series of negative news 
events capped by the failed UAL Corp. buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage noted that the market's weakness continued for the remainder of 
the year, with selective "bottom fishing" providing some support. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, junk bonds, which are high-risk securities below investment 
grade, posted only a 1.84% return, according to Salomon's index, compared to 
14.44% for investment grade bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds became popular in the mid-1980s when they were used to finance a 
series of spectacular, high-profile corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
But the $200-billion market fell apart in 1989, particularly in the banking and 
retail sectors, according to figures provided by Salomon. 
</P>
<P>
In the troubled thrift sector, junk bonds posted a loss of 9.77% for the fourth 
quarter of 1989 and a loss of 21.49% for the year. In the financial sector, 
junk bonds posted a loss of 5.7% for the fourth quarter and a loss of 18.66% 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
In the retail sector, where the empire built by Canadian Robert Campeau began 
to crumble, junk bonds posted a loss of 12.91% in the fourth quarter and a loss 
of 13.86% for the year, Salomon said. 
</P>
<P>
But the report said there were some bright spots in the picture for the 
selective investor. 
</P>
<P>
In the utility sector, junk bonds posted a return of 4.02% for the quarter and 
18.83% for the year. Automotive products was another strong sector, with junk 
bonds posting a return of 4.04% for the quarter and 14.65% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon said investment-grade bonds, which are considered less risky but less 
potentially lucrative than junk bonds, posted a 3.11% return in the 1989 fourth 
quarter. It said the bank sector of that market, hindered by the deteriorating 
real estate market, turned in the lowest sector return of 1.31%.

Approval of Long Beach Project Voided: A chemical company persuaded Judge David

Yaffe ruled that the Environmental Impact Report completed for the project did

A spokesman for the troubled Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. said the company is 
willing to hear from Jeff Reynolds, a Los Angeles businessman who announced 
over the weekend that he wanted to take control of the Australian company. 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp. executive Peter Lucas said Sunday that the company "looked forward 
to the next communication" from Reynolds but added that so far the proposal was 
lacking in detail. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Reynolds, 28, announced in Los Angeles that he was prepared to 
invest $250 million in Bond Corp. and in return take control of the company, 
whose brewing interests are now in the hands of receivers. The breweries 
include G. Heileman Brewing Co. of La Crosse, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that he could refinance the company's $6-billion debt 
and would talk again with multimillionaire businessman Alan Bond once the 
Victorian Supreme Court hearing into the receivership is over. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Sunday in Houston, Reynolds said he planned to travel 
to Perth in the coming weeks to discuss details of the bid with Bond. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scheduled to go back over to Perth shortly to work out definitive 
agreements," Reynolds said. "This is something we've been working on since 
September." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, chairman of Los Angeles-based Weatherby Investments, said California 
Pacific International Holdings Co. Pte Ltd., the Singapore-based parent firm of 
Weatherby, had been interested in buying Bond for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been looking for a lot of opportunities," Reynolds said. "We had a 
manager in Singapore who had some relationship with Bond and we opted to pursue 
that." 
</P>
<P>
A report in Saturday's London Times said Reynolds got the idea for a Bond Corp. 
takeover from California Pacific's managing director, Chew Chin Han, a friend 
of Australian businessman Kerry Packer. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said in the interview that he believes Bond's brewery interests remain 
healthy. He said Weatherby's main interests include oil, gas and financing.

Appeals Court Clears Payments: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has 
cleared the way for creditors of former Ohio financier Marvin Warner to begin 
receiving payments from a $16-million settlement approved last month by a 
federal bankruptcy judge. The court denied an attempt by the Internal Revenue 
Service to block the immediate distribution of $10 million. The remaining $6 
million will be distributed over the next three years.

REVVING UP THE '60S AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
CARS: SOME OF THOSE FANTASY WHEELS OF YESTERYEAR NOW PULL 10 TIMES THEIR 
ORIGINAL PRICE. A COTTAGE INDUSTRY IN RESTORATION SERVICES AND REPRODUCTION 
PARTS IS FLOURISHING. 
</P>

<P>
For Joe Schuler, it was love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
The low-slung Corvette, with its swoopy fenders and race car-like side-mounted 
exhaust pipes, was exactly what the Fullerton trucking company owner had been 
looking for. Nestled under the silver roadster's shark-like hood was a 
427-cubic-inch V-8, packing 400 horsepower -- or so the factory claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty thousand dollars later, the 1969 Corvette Stingray was his. That's a 
fairly healthy chunk of change to plunk down for a 21-year-old used car that 
listed at about $6,624 new, but for Schuler it was a reasonable price for a 
high-school fantasy come true. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the car I wanted then and this is the car I want now," said Schuler, 
sniffing at suggestions that his automotive needs could have been just as well 
served by, say, the 1990 high-tech, high-performance, high-quality, highly 
praised Lexus LS400. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler is not alone. Since the mid-1980s, thousands of people have been 
snapping up clean and not-so-clean examples of the rip-roaring, 
horsepower-packed GM, Ford and Chrysler cars of the 1960s and early '70s -- 
icons of a period when cars like Chevy's 409 and Plymouth's Hemi 'Cuda ruled 
America's roads and drag strips, and Detroit was the Mecca of the automotive 
world. 
</P>
<P>
But the trend -- and the prices -- have been accelerating. From Kevin's 2, a 
burger stand in the San Fernando Valley where hot rodders hang out Friday 
nights, to swap meets at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds, where 
special-interest cars and parts are sold, muscle cars are hot. Or, as Steve 
Anderson, an editor at Hot Rod magazine, puts it: "It's 1970 again." 
</P>
<P>
The muscle car craze has also spawned a nationwide cottage industry in car 
sales, restoration services and reproduction parts enabling the owner to 
recreate -- or fabricate -- the most popular muscle cars -- literally down to 
the last nut and bolt. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last year or so the market has absolutely gone crazy for performance 
cars of the '60s," said Dave Buck of Motoring World in West Hills, a store 
specializing in auto books. "Anything muscle car right now is really taking 
off." Even general newsstands feature magazines such as Guide to Muscle Cars, 
Chrysler Power and Musclecar Classics. 
</P>
<P>
And enthusiasts have their own organization, the National Muscle Car Assn., 
based in Memphis, Tenn. Formed two years ago, the organization, which sponsors 
car shows, swap meets and drag races that it dubs "High Performance Showdowns," 
has 1,371 members, 63 of them in California. "When I started doing this, 
everyone thought I was off my rocker. I've since proved everybody wrong," said 
Chuck Green, director of the National Muscle Car Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Why do people spend $25,000 and up for gas-guzzling cars when they could get, 
say, a new Ford Mustang that, properly equipped, can out-handle, out-accelerate 
and get better fuel mileage than many of the '60s cars -- and pass EPA emission 
standards to boot? 
</P>
<P>
"A car is an extension of one's personality and if you see a muscle car being 
driven down the road, the driver's trying to express something about himself," 
said Green. "A muscle car is not a necessity of life. Ninety percent of the 
time, if a guy's in a financial bind, the car's the first thing he'll 
liquidate." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson sums it up in a word: nostalgia. "One of the things that represents 
Americana are cars, and muscle cars in particular. These guys are trying to 
live the past." 
</P>
<P>
But more and more, the driving force of muscle-car mania is cash. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Pontiac GTO, considered by most auto enthusiasts to be the original 
muscle car. In 1964, Pontiac product planners fired the first salvo in what 
would become Detroit's muscle car war with a bold yet simple formula: dropping 
a big-car engine (in this case, 389 cubic inches) into a mid-size, lighter body 
(the Tempest/LeMans), gracing it with a couple of fake hood louvers, a racy 
name and a raucous exhaust system. 
</P>
<P>
The GTO was an immediate hit on the boulevards, drag strips and showroom floor. 
Jan and Dean, a popular rock 'n' roll duo of the era, sang its praises in their 
hit, "Little GTO." 
</P>
<P>
But there's nothing little about the prices of GTOs, which, like other muscle 
cars, have grown dear with time. In 1964, the sticker price of a GTO was about 
$3,000. Last January, a convertible sold at a Scottsdale, Ariz., auction for 
$23,000. Later this month another 1964 GTO convertible -- this one said to be 
in showroom condition with only 18,000 miles on the odometer -- will be on the 
block at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, an event well-known among 
auto collectors. Officials expect the red ragtop to fetch $40,000 to $50,000. 
Green, of the National Muscle Car Assn., says the prices of the most desirable 
high-performance cars of the '60s are "increasing at the rate of 5% a month." 
</P>
<P>
Factor in rarity and top-of-the-line engine options, and the rules go out the 
window. For instance, if you can find a 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda convertible 
for sale, prepare to fork over in the neighborhood of $200,000, said Green, 
explaining that only seven ragtops were ordered with the 425-horsepower engine. 
The car, typically equipped, listed at $4,959 new. 
</P>
<P>
Muscle cars have always been popular with a certain segment of the car-loving 
public but prices during the past three years shot through the roof -- thanks 
to the strength of collector cars in general, said Craig Jackson, of 
Phoenix-based Barrett-Jackson Auction Co. 
</P>
<P>
Collector-car values -- most notably Ferraris -- took off as a direct result of 
the October, 1987, stock market crash, note some observers. Jackson, however, 
looks for muscle cars this year "to level out and take their usual growth" -- 
about 25%. "It's better for the industry because it's not so volatile. People 
were a little paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
That would be a welcome trend, agrees Mike Patlin, of Hill &amp; Vaughn, an 
internationally known restoration company in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more we're seeing people getting into it not as enthusiasts but for 
the investment," said Patlin. "People buy these things and stick them in 
warehouses, and their only sense of enjoyment is to see them make money -- not 
to get them outside and drive them." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the ultimate irony is that eventually the car may become so valuable 
that the owner cannot afford to drive it -- or is afraid to. And no one is hurt 
more by muscle car inflation than those who grew up in the days of 
29-cent-a-gallon gasoline and simply like the car for what it is, said Hot 
Rod's Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
For baby boomers who want to start a muscle car collection, used-car sticker 
shock awaits. "If you're a first-time buyer and you want to get into this, you 
have to pay a lot more now," said Merle DuPrey, a San Fernando Valley car 
enthusiast and collector whose stable of muscle cars includes Chevrolet 
Camaros, Corvettes, and a Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda coupe. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards, however, can be substantial. Green, of the National Muscle Car 
Assn., said: "There are people buying and selling cars who are now close to 
six-figure incomes. And they're doing it as a sideline." 
</P>
<P>
Muscle cars are more than a sideline to Jeff Leonard. He operates Classic 
Camaro, a Huntington Beach company that offers new and reproduction parts for 
Camaros and Firebirds. Classic Camaro opened shop in 1976 after Leonard and a 
friend decided that Camaros would soon join the 1964-1969 Mustangs as modern 
classic autos. 
</P>
<P>
The hunch paid off. Last year Leonard's company sold about $8 million in parts 
and accessories and is aiming for $10 million this year, he said. Classic 
Camaro has a 250,000-person mailing list of potential customers who range from 
16 to 64 years old. 
</P>
<P>
And the appreciation of muscle cars hasn't been lost on car enthusiasts -- or 
investors -- overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Classic Camaro and Year One, a major supplier of muscle car 
parts based in Georgia, have shipped goods to Japan, Canada, Finland, South 
America and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
So, who knows? Perhaps 1990's world-class American-built car just might be your 
father's Oldsmobile -- if it's a cherry 1970 4-4-2 that was raced only on 
Sundays.

CROOKS PREY ON THE UNWITTING WITH CLONED CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF YIP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a dark side of muscle car collecting. 
</P>
<P>
"As the stakes went up, the crooks came out," explained Corvette aficionado 
Brian Lee, of Mt. Pleasant, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem: unscrupulous sellers and restorers who clone muscle cars 
from standard models and pass them off as original. For example, said Craig 
Jackson of Barrett-Jackson Auction Co., it's all too easy to be stung when 
dealing with 1963-67 Chevrolet Corvettes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the most powerful versions of the 1967 Sting Rays sold for as much 
as $100,000. But experts say there are now more of these Corvettes -- known as 
"tri-powers" because of their three-carburetor induction systems -- on the road 
than were produced by the factory, thanks to the availability of restoration 
parts and the potential for big bucks. In fact, sharp scroungers are turning 
salvage-yard iron into gold, asking as much as $4,000 for correctly dated and 
numbered carburetor setups alone. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a dozen years ago, $4,000 would buy a first-rate, 
original-condition 1967 Corvette convertible, powered by a 427-cubic-inch, 
435-horsepower engine. And that was for a car with "documentation" -- the bill 
of sale, manufacturer's window sticker, factory order sheet, dealership invoice 
and title and service records coveted by hard-core auto collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to verify one of those cars," says Tom Sloe of the 
Corvettes. "They make every piece of documentation now. All they're doing is 
changing the number on the engine to correspond to the (vehicle identification 
number) on the car. 
</P>
<P>
"As collectors we need to band together and turn over to the authorities 
anybody who is committing fraud," said Sloe, a Cleveland-area auto repair shop 
owner who has 25 muscle cars. "That's the biggest thing that will hurt these 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to protect yourself is to become an expert -- read, join car clubs 
and attend car shows, swap meets and nostalgia races -- or hire an expert. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to wish a car is what it is claimed. It's also a very good way 
to lose a lot of money," said Robert DeMars, whose Oakland company appraises 
collectible autos and charges a minimum of $470 to appraise a muscle car. JEFF

QUALIFYING THE SUPERLATIVES; 
</P>
<P>
GRUBB &amp; ELLIS OFFICER KEEPS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every year about this time a deluge of economic statistics pours from 
government, the banks and the universities. In Orange County those statistics 
are often framed in superlatives: The most expensive houses, the most new jobs, 
the lowest unemployment. For a place that, until recently, was just another 
suburb of Los Angeles, Orange County has become an economic power in its own 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, land in Orange County is so scarce and expensive that a single 
acre in a residential neighborhood in Irvine is said to cost as much as $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeways lay claim to a new superlative: some of the most clogged highway 
interchanges in the nation. Houses are so expensive -- a new one costs about 
$380,000 on the average -- that the middle class is abandoning the county and 
moving inland to Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, everything about Orange County's economic life -- its problems and 
its pluses -- seems outsized for what is, after all, just a sprawling 
collection of suburbs. It's sometimes difficult to get it in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. employs people like Dennis W. 
Macheski. 
</P>
<P>
 As a vice president and director of research for Grubb's southwest region, one 
of Macheski's jobs, in a sense, is to keep things in perspective for the 
commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Macheski, 40, comes by his facility with figures naturally. He has an 
undergraduate degree in urban studies and a master's degree in urban planning 
-- both from USC -- and an MBA from UCLA. Before joining Grubb &amp; Ellis two 
years ago, he worked for the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Michael Flagg talked to Macheski about how Orange County's 
economy compares with the rest of the Southwest and the nation, and what that 
means in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's take the big picture first. How does the economy of the Southwest -- 
which you define as Southern California and Arizona -- stack up to the rest of 
the nation? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's astounding. The growth rate has been about three times the national 
average for population and about twice the national average for employment 
recently. The reason it's astounding is because you usually only see that type 
of growth when you have a small base, places of 4 million or 5 million people. 
But we're talking about a base of 17 million people that's growing at rates of 
2.5% a year. Nowhere else in the industrialized world do you have that large an 
area growing so rapidly. The national average is less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do those increases translate into in real numbers? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's 3 million new people in the last decade alone just in Southern 
California. In the rest of the industrialized world, large metropolitan areas 
grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. But around the 1970s a plateau started. 
You now see growth rates of half a percent to 1% a year. Southern California, 
on the other hand, began to plateau too. But then it picked up again. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where are all these new people coming from? 
</P>
<P>
A: What appears to be happening is a combination of high levels of immigration 
with high levels of natural increase -- births -- in the population. If you 
look at who's moving here, we get a large amount of highly educated, well-paid 
professionals and managers moving from within the U.S. And then we get a lot of 
immigrants, mainly Mexican. We're becoming more bipolar, with the upper end of 
the scale and the lower end increasing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That doesn't sound good. Aren't you describing the gradual disappearance of 
the middle class? 
</P>
<P>
A. From a perspective of economic growth, it's healthy. You can't expect the 
children of immigrants to keep low-skilled jobs forever, and one of our biggest 
challenges is going to be incorporating them into the economic mainstream. But 
if you take a look at industry sectors that have grown nationwide, they tend to 
be the higher-skill jobs and management at one end and factory jobs in light 
industries at the other end. And that's what's happening here. But there's also 
something happening here that's very different from the rest of the United 
States because elsewhere there's a big shortage of lower-skilled employees 
which is getting worse. We don't have such a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the outlook for Southern California for the next five years? 
</P>
<P>
A. think it's unrealistic to expect Southern California to grow as dramatically 
as it has in the last five years. It can't continue. We'll be running out of 
land and running into congestion. Typically, a large metro area must eventually 
slow down and approach the national average. I'd expect a growth rate 
two-thirds that of the last five years both in population and employment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. As the baby boom passes, there just aren't going to be that many people in 
the labor force. There's also the drop in unemployment from 8% a few years ago 
to 5%. That doesn't sound like much, but based on the size of the nation's work 
force it's a huge increase in the number of new employees. Since we're now 
approaching a point where unemployment is near its natural floor of 4% or 5%, 
there won't be any new employees available from the pool of unemployed people. 
Then there's been a large increase in women in the labor force in the last two 
decades, but that's also approaching a ceiling. When those sources of employees 
top out, all we'll have is the natural increase in population, which will mean 
less dramatic growth in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One could assume that would mean less demand for factory and office space? 
</P>
<P>
A. would expect a slowdown in the absorption of office space and industrial 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do things generally look in the so-called Inland Empire, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties? 
</P>
<P>
A. If there's a problem in terms of employment growth in Southern California, 
it's in the Inland Empire. It's been good, but population growth has been 
fantastic. So if there's a problem, it's an imbalance between growth in jobs 
and growth in housing there, which means all those new residents have to 
commute back to Los Angeles and Orange County to get to their jobs. Still, job 
growth out there has been very strong. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see Riverside and San Bernardino counties developing an employment 
base large enough to eventually correct that imbalance? The freeways could use 
the help. 
</P>
<P>
A. It will, with a lag. If you look at subregions of urban areas, like the San 
Fernando Valley or Orange County, there appears to be a 20-year time lag 
between population growth and employment growth. In the Valley and in Orange 
County, the population boom began in the 1950s, and the employment boom didn't 
happen until 20 years later. In the Inland Empire the housing boom began in the 
mid-1970s as people began fleeing high housing costs in Orange County and Los 
Angeles, so it'll probably be at least the 1990s before it catches up. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is Southern California so different from the rest of the nation? 
</P>
<P>
A. Our proximity to Asia, to Mexico; our climate; the tremendous investment in 
the 1950s and 1960s -- which we're now reaping -- in ports and airports and the 
freeway system. The fact we're so new as a region means our employment doesn't 
depend on heavy industry as much as the Midwest and East, and as it turns out 
heavy industry is not growing. What's growing is light manufacturing, business 
services, and those tend to be the types of industries we have. You still have 
a lot of room for growth, with lots of vacant land in places like Ventura 
County, the southern part of Orange County and the Inland Empire. I've 
calculated at current densities you could fit about 23 million people into 
Southern California, and right now we've got about 17 million, so we've got a 
ways to go. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've heard people in the real estate industry -- who tend to be optimists -- 
contend that the county is virtually recession-proof because its employers are 
so diverse; that what's happening in Massachusetts, for instance, couldn't 
happen here. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's kind of like watches. It's "resistant," not "recession-proof." In the 
sense that we are diversified, that there are a large number of small firms, 
most of which tend to be in the more prosperous businesses, we are going to 
feel the impact of a recession less. But the county's had recessions before, 
and it can in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the purely local problems of Orange County that are unrelated to 
broad economic cycles, things like the jammed freeways, the deteriorating 
quality of life and the high housing costs. Do you think it likely they'll have 
a big impact on the county's economic health? 
</P>
<P>
A. You haven't mentioned one of our biggest problems, the education of the 
immigrants who've come here. The key thing, though, is that what we see as 
"deterioration" still looks pretty good to many other parts of the nation. My 
perspective is we'll continue to draw jobs and people from the rest of the 
country. Besides, many places much more congested than Orange County have grown 
rapidly in the past. There's New York and most of the big cities of the East 
Coast. Out here there's San Jose, which is incredibly congested. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So the outlook for real estate should still be pretty good in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. There have been very, very high levels of construction in the last five 
years. It appears as though that's slowing down right now in construction of 
office and industrial space. It's not slowing in the rest of Southern 
California, however. Specifically, Orange County has 26% of Southern 
California's office space. Last year it captured 29% of all new office space, 
so it had a share of construction that was slightly disproportionately high. If 
you take a look at what's under construction now, though, only 15% of Southern 
California's office space is under construction in Orange County. It appears as 
though construction of office space has actually picked up in places like 
downtown Los Angeles and central Los Angeles, while it's down here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is it slower in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. For the last four or five years Orange County's had the highest level of 
office vacancies in Southern California. That's not because demand was weak but 
because construction was so extraordinarily high. I think the downturn in 
construction now is a natural adjustment to a high vacancy rate. Developers and 
lenders are being more conservative. The vacancy rates in West Los Angeles are 
11%, in Orange County they're 21%. I think people are deciding to build more up 
there than in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about factories? 
</P>
<P>
A. Orange County has 17% of Southern California's industrial space; last year 
13% of the new space was in Orange County, so it's a decreasing share. What's 
currently under construction is about 11% because the price of land has gone up 
so dramatically that businesses which use a lot of land, like warehouses, are 
moving to the Inland Empire. The type of industrial space going up here is much 
higher-end; much of it's research and development space. All this bodes well 
for Orange County in the future: If there's a downturn, people won't get caught 
with a lot of empty space they can't rent. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your figures show both the Inland Empire and San Diego growing faster than 
Orange County these days. How much faster? 
</P>
<P>
A. In 1980 the populations of Orange County and San Diego were both growing by 
about 40,000 people a year. If you look at the last nine years, Orange County 
has consistently added about 40,000, but San Diego added 50,000 the next year, 
60,000 the next and now they're adding 90,000 people a year. They're on an 
upward swing, while Orange County has plateaued with strong steady growth. In 
the Inland Empire, population grew last year by 6.7%, which is astronomical on 
a base of nearly 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What does this mean? 
</P>
<P>
A. What you're seeing is that Orange County has turned out to be the most 
mature of the three areas, while the other two are growing far more rapidly. To 
some extent Orange County serves as the business center for this triangle of 
growth, both the Inland Empire and northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is San Diego booming? 
</P>
<P>
A. For some of the same reasons as the Inland Empire: In northern San Diego 
county, land is available and housing is less expensive. It also goes back to 
the fact San Diego's near the coast, has relatively little smog -- it's kind of 
like the Orange County of the '60s. In terms of its economy, it's exceptionally 
well diversified, although unlike Orange County it tends to be strong not in 
high-tech but higher-tech types of industries such as making medical 
instruments, the more sophisticated kinds of printing and manufacturing of 
clothing. If growth rates were to drop by half in San Diego tomorrow, it'd 
still be growing as fast as Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are our faster-growing neighbors a long-term trend? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, and they'll outpace L.A. in terms of percentages of growth too. It's a 
function of vacant, available land. There's much more of it out there than 
there is here, and that means more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In light of that, what do you see happening in Orange County real estate 
over the next 10 years or so? 
</P>
<P>
A. Growth will shift to the south, to the Irvine Spectrum area and beyond; 
there'll be a shift toward higher-end office space, the kind that has covered 
parking that you pay for, with mid- and high-rise buildings; the bulldozing of 
low-slung, low-density buildings and their replacement with high-rises; 
residential building will be denser too, with demolition of existing duplexes 
and construction of apartment buildings with more units; Brea will be 
extraordinarily attractive to firms like insurance companies looking for a big, 
medium-skilled labor force; and housing will still be in big demand as our 
40,000 people a year continue to come in over the next five years, although 
that'll probably slow down as we begin to run out of land. 
</P>
<P>
Q. San Diego, I assume, will grow much larger than Orange County eventually? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's destined to be larger. It, too, has much more vacant land than 
Orange County. And it has a harbor and an international airport. The two 
counties were roughly the same size in 1980, about 1.93 million for Orange and 
1.86 million for San Diego. Now San Diego is 2.4 million and Orange County is 
2.3 million, and that gap will grow.

TREKKIE PLATES TAKE THE CAKE AT 'CREATION' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting amid his inventory of "Star Trek" fan magazines, "Star Trek" T-shirts 
and, new this year, "Star Trek: The Next Generation" sewing patterns, Stan 
Stice made a startling revelation: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly like 'Star Trek,' " the memorabilia dealer said, stifling 
a yawn. "To some people, 'Star Trek' is a life; to me, it's just a business." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but what a business it is. At the Inn at the Park over the weekend, several 
hundred television fans paid $16 each to attend "Creation in Anaheim," where 
they also had the opportunity to purchase such items as "Beauty and the Beast" 
door hangers, "Lost in Space" videotapes and "Growing Pains" trading cards from 
dealers like Stice. 
</P>
<P>
They were further entertained by appearances of two television icons: Dawn 
Wells, who played the perky Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island," and Mark Lenard, 
who, among other roles as upscale TV aliens, portrayed Spock's icy father, 
Sarek, on "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
Both actors shared behind-the-scenes high jinks with members of the adoring 
crowd, who shouted out trivia about the shows that even Wells and Lenard had 
forgotten. They deftly handled controversial questions: On the question of 
whether it would be artistically wrong to colorize the early black and white 
"Gilligan's Island" episodes, Wells confided to her fans, "I don't know how I 
feel about that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he agreed with the unenthusiastic critical response to "Star Trek V: 
The Final Frontier," Lenard, who appears in the film, said: "It's not quite 
right to knock the thing that feeds you." 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing story from "Creation" came not from the fantasy worlds of 
Hollywood but rather from the unlikely industry of porcelain and bisque: "Star 
Trek" collector plates, issued two years ago for a mere $39.99, now were 
fetching minimums of $75; some up to $200. In contrast, collector plates 
featuring the buxom horror movie personality Elvira could only command $65. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the plates cannot be used to serve food, dealer Leonard Ericson 
explained, as they are made with toxic paints. Instead, they are intended to be 
displayed on the wall. Linda Tanenbaum, a court clerk wearing a "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation" T-shirt, said she has four such plates decorating her 
Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have this stuff as a reminder of what 'Star Trek' represents," 
she said, namely "that we can have world peace." 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum said she contributes to world peace by repeating the singsong chants 
of the Buddhist sect known as NSA. While the Pax Startrekiana still may be out 
of reach, Tanenbaum said her religious devotion has been supernaturally 
rewarded on a smaller scale: At an October "Star Trek" convention in San Jose, 
she proudly recalled, she was chosen to help escort Leonard Nimoy, who plays 
Spock, to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum was among dozens of fans who said they had purchased collector plates 
to adorn their homes. One even said that the opportunity to buy the porcelain 
trinkets helps avid Trekkies maintain their moral compass. Asserted Gary Blog: 
"Say what you will, they're a whole lot better than doing drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Blog, 26, had paid his own way from Edison, N.J., to volunteer as a doorman for 
the convention, which is a profit-making enterprise of Long Island-based 
Creation Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is headed by Adam Malin, 33, who journeyed from his Mineola, N.Y., 
headquarters to oversee the Anaheim affair. Malin said Creation operates more 
than 100 events nationwide each year, focusing on the interests of science 
fiction and fantasy fans. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the company, which he and a partner founded as teen-agers, pays 
tribute to the artists behind such works as "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and 
"Gremlins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Creation' refers to the creativity of various creators who have brought 
their creative properties and their creative processes to the world," Malin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He described Creation as a "multimillion-dollar business in the 
multibillion-dollar entertainment industry," but wouldn't elaborate on its 
financial standing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the remarkable appreciation of "Star Trek" collector 
plates, though, Malin displayed considerable investment savvy: "You think 
that's something? Listen to this: a pair of Spock ears from 'Star Trek V' go 
for $1,000 -- And we at Creation," he said with a smile, "have got one." 
</P>
<P>
As often is the case in the entertainment industry, while those on the business 
side reap fortunes from their investments, those with creative talents find 
themselves with little to show for their work. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the skyrocketing prices of collector plates, Lenard, whose image 
appears in them, was taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"Really? Two hundred dollars? Why so much?" he wondered, almost losing the cool 
Vulcan demeanor he says has become part of his personality. "I thought they 
were supposed to go for $35." 
</P>
<P>
Lenard revealed that he and other "Star Trek" cast members had received "a 
nominal fee" for posing for the airbrushed mock-tableware portraits and were, 
additionally, to receive copies of the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
These copies, he said, had never been delivered. Gazing straight ahead with 
unearthly equanimity, he logically concluded: "Who would've thought they'd be 
worth so much? No wonder they never sent them to me."

A 17-year-old suspected of robbing a convenience store today was arrested after 
driving a stolen vehicle off a freeway embankment during a high-speed police 
chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, whose name was withheld because of his age, was treated for minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Brian David Hall, 19, is in critical but stable condition at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital, Officer Richard McMillen said. Both are from Corona, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a robbery call from the Circle K market on Stanton Avenue 
near Manchester Boulevard in Buena Park about 4:15 a.m. today, McMillen said. 
The manager of the store said about $60 was taken. Witnesses said the robbers 
drove off in a white Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Police saw a vehicle matching that description entering the Riverside Freeway 
westbound from Beach Boulevard shortly after the incident. The driver refused 
to stop for police, and a chase reaching speeds of 90 m.p.h. ensued, McMillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit lasted less than five minutes and ended with the Ford driving off 
an embankment near the 1700 block of Ardmore Avenue in Bellflower, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was in Juvenile Hall after being booked for suspicion of robbery and 
possession of a stolen vehicle, and Hall is to be booked for the same crimes 
when he is released by the hospital, police said.

A suspected gang member is being sought in a fatal shooting at a Lancaster 
birthday party, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Sanford, 18, died at 9:30 a.m. Sunday at Antelope Valley Medical 
Center, about 10 hours after the Saturday night shooting at a home in the 44700 
block of Benald Street, Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
A guest at the party, Sheldon Culver, 24, was hospitalized and in stable 
condition with a gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, believed to be 16 to 18 years old, has not been identified, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Hom said the incident began when three suspected gang members attempted to 
crash a birthday party at the Benald Street home. There was a dispute as the 
three were being ejected and one of them drew a gun and shot Culver in the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
The three were then chased from the house, Hom said. In front of the home, the 
gunman turned and fired a shot at his pursuers and instead shot Sanford, who 
had not been involved in the incident, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just happened to be leaving the party at that time," Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Hom said the three teen-agers who crashed the party escaped.

PAY BUCHWALD, STUDIO TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HUMORIST WINS FIGHT OVER MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures Corp. was ordered today to pay humorist Art Buchwald for the 
script idea that Buchwald said formed the basis for the hit movie "Coming to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
In a 34-page, tentative decision handed down in Buchwald's $5-million breach of 
contract lawsuit against Paramount, Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider 
decided that Eddie Murphy may have been given screen credit in 1988 for writing 
the story that became the movie, but it was based on an eight-page treatment 
written by Buchwald in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which most likely will become final within 10 days, opens the way 
for a second phase in the trial, during which Buchwald and co-plaintiff Alain 
Bernheim, a veteran Hollywood producer who worked with Buchwald on producing 
the treatment, will be able to demand a complete accounting of the more than 
$300 million that the movie has earned thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider did not specify a dollar amount for damages, so it was not 
immediately clear how much money Buchwald and Bernheim stand to collect for 
their role in the film. But Pierce O' Donnell, Buchwald's attorney, said the 
figure could be between $5 million and $10 million. Paramount officials, 
however, put their liability only at $250,000 -- the figure contained in their 
contract with Buchwald. 
</P>
<P>
"The court concludes that 'Coming to America' is a movie that was 'based upon' 
Buchwald's treatment, 'King for a Day,' " Schneider wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the final movie, however, "is no less the product of Eddie 
Murphy's creativity because of the court's decision" and reserved sole blame 
for Paramount in breaching its contract with Buchwald and Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, the court wishes again to emphasize that its decision is in no way 
intended to disparage the creative talent of Eddie Murphy," he wrote. "It was 
Paramount and not Murphy who prepared the agreement in question." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount attorney Bob Draper said the studio will appeal immediately and 
added: "Basically they (Buchwald and Bernheim) spent $1 million in attorneys 
fees to make $250,000." He called the decision a "financial victory" for the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount optioned Buchwald's story "It's a Crude, Crude World" seven years ago 
as a possible vehicle for Murphy. The treatment was later renamed "King for a 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
The comedy about an African king who comes to Washington in the hope of getting 
nuclear arms and winds up taking a bride home with him bears little resemblance 
to the "black fairy tale" that Murphy said he was responsible for bringing to 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
In the Murphy story, an African prince comes to New York in search of a bride. 
Like the Buchwald character, Murphy's Prince Akeem winds up in the ghetto, 
where he has a series of comic misadventures before he finds his queen and 
returns to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the contract called for Paramount to pay Buchwald and Bernheim if 
a movie was based upon the columnist's original story. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 contract between the studio, Buchwald and Bernheim calls for them to 
receive 19% of the net earnings of any movie that resulted from Buchwald's 
story treatment. Paramount officials maintain, though, that the movie has not 
yet earned any net profits.

TERRY-THOMAS, KNOWN FOR COMIC ROLES AS CADS, DIES

<P>
Terry-Thomas, the gap-toothed comedian who played the cad in dozens of British 
and American films including "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines," 
died today at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
Terry-Thomas, disabled and impoverished by Parkinson's disease, died of 
complications from the illness at a nursing home in Godalming, Surrey, 
according to an announcement from the Parkinson's Disease Society. 
</P>
<P>
The star of films that included "I'm All Right, Jack" and "It's a Mad Mad Mad 
Mad World" had been too ill to attend a gala benefit in his honor in London 
last April, which raised $51,000 for his care. 
</P>
<P>
Terry-Thomas battled the degenerative muscle disease since 1971 and had been 
unable to work for several years. His last film roles included "The Last Remake 
of Beau Geste" in 1977 and "The Hound of the Baskervilles" in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
A cigarette holder, a well-brushed mustache and the gap between his upper front 
teeth were Terry-Thomas' signatures. He often portrayed the upper-class cad 
murmuring "jolly good show," such as his role as Sir Percy in "Those 
Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines." 
</P>
<P>
"It's much more fun being the stinker," he once said. "I've made all my money 
-- or most of it anyway -- sending up pompous Englishmen. I was exposed to an 
awful lot of them as a young man and when I come back to Britain, I still see 
plenty of them walking about."

Eritrean rebels attacked and crippled a Polish freighter off the Ethiopian 
coast and captured 29 crew members and a passenger, the Polish government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard that the crew is safe and in the care of the Eritrean Liberation 
Front," government spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said at a Warsaw news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Staniszewski said the Eritreans admitted their guerrillas attacked the vessel 
Jan. 3 and that the 29 crew members and a woman passenger, identified by Polish 
newspapers as the wife of a crewman, were captured. 
</P>
<P>
Staniszewski said the 11,627-ton vessel, Boleslaw Krzywousty, was found ablaze, 
unmanned and apparently aground Jan. 4 off the Ethiopian coast by the Polish 
ship Asnyk, which was alerted by distress signals.

The judge in the assault case of reputed Mafia boss John Gotti ruled today that 
jurors in the case be sequestered, saying "your well-being and comfort are my 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
In a highly unusual ruling for a state case, Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin 
granted the prosecution's request at the start of jury selection in Gotti's 
assault trial. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors requested the panel be sequestered to protect against possible jury 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors will be sequestered when they are are sworn in for the trial, which 
could be as early as Tuesday. Jury selection was expected to take at least two 
weeks and trial itself three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gotti could receive a life sentence as a repeat offender if convicted of 
assault and conspiracy in an attack on a union leader.

Former East German leader Erich Honecker is in an East Berlin hospital and will 
undergo surgery for a cancerous kidney tumor, the West German news agency DPA 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, is under official investigation on charges of profiteering and 
abuses of power, but East German doctors said last week that he was suffering 
from a malignant kidney tumor and was too ill to be jailed. 
</P>
<P>
DPA, quoting hospital sources, said the former hard-line Communist leader was 
admitted at East Berlin's Charite hospital last weekend. The agency said 
Honecker was seen in the corridors of the hospital, wearing a jogging outfit 
and looking "well considering the circumstances."

Visa International announced today that Czechoslovakia's oldest retail bank 
will begin offering Visa cards to citizens there next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Visa cards to be offered by Zivnostenska Banka will represent the first 
international payment card issued in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The bank intends to initially offer a regular Visa card and a Visa Business 
Card for frequent travelers to customers with income in foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
The cards will access the customer's own funds, according to Visa 
International. 
</P>
<P>
"This not only marks a significant breakthrough to a new Eastern European 
market, it is a graphic illustration of the payment card as an international 
currency," Jean-Jacques Desbons, executive vice president of Visa 
International, said in a statement.

CONVICTED BROKER CHARGED IN TAX EVASION SCHEME

A former vice president of a top Wall Street brokerage and 11 others were 
charged today with using money from an earlier fraud to organize a $1.1-million 
tax evasion scheme in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Stahl, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1987 for mail fraud at 
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and the others were charged with setting up 
companies that conspired to evade $1.1 million in state fuel taxes, said Nancy 
Connell, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
They were charged with enterprise corruption under an organized crime statute 
that carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail and fines. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged scheme involved several companies set up to deliver fuel to the Big 
Apple and Big M truck stops in the Albany suburb of Glenmont, Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants allegedly bought home heating oil and had it sold as diesel fuel 
at the truck stops, Connell said. Through this process, they avoided paying 
diesel fuel taxes, which are much higher than home heating oil taxes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of hiding from authorities the amount of diesel fuel 
they brought into the truck stops, evading still more taxes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stahl was convicted of transferring more than $1 million in Shearson funds to 
various bank accounts he controlled in 1986 and 1987. He admitted in court, 
however, to a much larger scheme involving more than $18 million.

Fujitsu Ltd. said today it has developed a "super neural computer" with 
processing speeds several hundred times faster than that of models on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
A prototype built by Fujitsu Laboratories links 256 digital signal processors 
in parallel to achieve processing speeds of 500 million connection updates per 
second, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
This is several hundred times faster than models sold by U.S. companies and 
about 2,000 times quicker than neural network simulations run on engineering 
workstations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neural networks simulate the workings of the brain, which through its network 
of interconnected neurons and synapses is capable of processing tremendous 
quantities of data and performing many tasks simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for commercializing the Fujitsu system.

Campeau Corp. denied a published report today that it had changed its mind 
about selling Bloomingdale's, its flagship New York department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfounded," Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said of an article in 
Britain's Financial Times that reported the Canadian retailer had abandoned its 
attempts to sell the prestigious Bloomingdale's because of the inadequate level 
of offers received. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no change" in Bloomingdale's status, Sanger said. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau put Bloomingdale's up for sale more than three months ago to ease the 
parent company's cash crunch and expected it to fetch up to $1.5 billion. 
Campeau bought the department store chain two years ago.

Parts of Comecon are obsolete and need radical changes, but the Soviet Union 
opposes disbanding the East Bloc trade alliance as some nations have suggested, 
a Soviet spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov indicated what the Soviet 
response will be to appeals by Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland for a major 
overhaul of Comecon when it meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov blamed poor implementation of good past decisions for many of 
Comecon's woes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no dynamism. There is no sign of improvement in the trade structure. 
There is no technological progress," he said. "And so we believe there must be 
radical measures to restructure the mechanism of cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "As far as the direct answer to whether we need Comecon or not, 
yes, we need it," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus said Thursday there was no reason 
for Comecon to exist.

Cuba's Communist Party daily Granma published an article today ridiculing a 
professional boxing tournament held in the Soviet Union, saying it was more 
like a circus show than a boxing competition. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rare outburst of criticism for an event hosted by the Soviet Union, 
Cuba's principal political ally and main trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
The article by Nadia Diaz, Granma's correspondent in Moscow, described what it 
said was the first professional boxing tournament held between the Soviet 
Union, the United States, Mexico, Italy and France. It was shown on Soviet 
television Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"What my eyes witnessed this Saturday on Moscow television was something that I 
wouldn't like to put a name to so as not to hurt the feelings of our beloved 
brother nation," Diaz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But she went on: "In reality, what I saw was more of a circus show than a 
boxing bout."

Nuggets Coach Doug Moe says Golden State's Don Nelson should be named coach of 
the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team without delay. 
</P>
<P>
Moe also said during an interview on Sunday that he thinks it is a mistake to 
allow NBA players to compete in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He said Nelson, who went on record last week as saying he wanted the Olympic 
coaching job, is suited for the job and should get it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd give it to him right now and get it over with," said Moe, "because it's a 
headache. I'm sure there's a lot of pride and a great honor, but I wouldn't 
want to do it. They should just give it to someone who wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Moe earlier had thought he might want the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I've thought about it, the more I think Nellie should have the job 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing use of NBA players in the Olympics, Moe shrugged off the argument 
that European countries have been allowed to use professional players in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"What a joke," he said. "Our college system is more professional than their pro 
leagues. They're more professional than college? Why? Because they pay their 
players? A lot of the college players are getting paid anyway." 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel the pros shouldn't be in it," said Moe. "The system is pretty good 
now. Why mess it up?"

DON'T BURY RAMS; THEY SHOW UNIQUE TALENT FOR WINNING

<P>
To begin with, you don't want to minimize the skills of the Los Angeles Rams 
because they beat the New York Giants in overtime with the help of an 
interference call so thin it was almost a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
You want to remind yourself, instead, that the Rams this season have been a 
special group of opportunists. When the money has been on the line, they have 
made the plays. 
</P>
<P>
And you had better not assume they won't make them next Sunday in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you want to consider is the cerebral flameout of the Giants 
coach, Mr. Bill Parcells, who may have blown the game to the Rams with a 
decision too dumb to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells is sitting on a 6-0 lead with 35 seconds remaining in the first half. 
His team is dominating the match. It is deep in its own territory. Instead of 
squandering the time, the bench orders a pass that makes no sense at all. It is 
intercepted by the Rams who, characteristically this season, quickly strike 
with a scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
So they leave the grounds 7-6 in front at the half, and this affects the 
outcome as much as the interference call, which, inevitably, will lead to 
general review of that infraction when the collective brains of the rules 
committee are brought next into session. 
</P>
<P>
The interference rule in the NFL always has been, and remains, a stupendous 
joke. Arbitrarily, you can't award penalties of 35, 40, even 50 yards in a game 
whose field measures only 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It turns tactical endeavor into a farce. To march 50 yards, a team can require 
10 plays. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, through incidental contact on a pass, it can gain that much on one shot. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL must interpret the interference call as the late and lamented USFL did. 
The USFL recognized two forms of interference. One, called incidental contact, 
brought a 10-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The other, willful contact, such as tackling a receiver, meant a penalty at the 
spot of the foul. 
</P>
<P>
But when Sheldon White, cornerback for New York, brushes in an almost 
irrelevant way Flipper Anderson of the Rams while the teams are playing in 
overtime Sunday, and when this means 27 yards for the Rams, the connoisseur, 
not to mention the sport, has something serious to think about. 
</P>
<P>
This puts New York out of business, but not before the Rams jump on the 
opportunity and throw a touchdown pass immediately after the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, the Rams made money plays, especially in the first half when, on 
defense, they stopped the Giants at vital junctures to turn touchdowns into 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
By the fourth quarter, the Giants have the lead by 13-10 and they have the 
ball, third down and two. 
</P>
<P>
If they make the yardage, it is bon voyage Rams, but the Rams hold, force a 
punt and come back to tie the game, leading to the accident befalling the 
Giants in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been performing in this unique way, explaining their enviable 
position today, and, working up a major foam over San Francisco next Sunday, 
you may be setting yourself up for a jolt. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are unique in still another way. As teams go in the NFL today, they 
aren't very well paid. They don't have the genius to split the atom, but they 
can count. 
</P>
<P>
And, not counting enough at each payday, they grumble. 
</P>
<P>
But still they play with diligence, and you have to toss a bouquet to their 
field leader, John Robinson, for getting them to expend such energy on short 
rations. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson doesn't arrange the payroll. All he does is persuade his forces to try 
as hard as colleagues on other teams who earn more. 
</P>
<P>
As the late Walter O'Malley used to tell the laborers, "Money isn't everything. 
The only thing that counts is friendship." 
</P>
<P>
If you are searching for still another reason why the Rams dispatched the 
Giants Sunday, it would be the way their blocking linemen took care of Lawrence 
Taylor and the rest of the Giants rush in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Taylor opened the game as some kind of monster, setting siege to the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
By the third quarter, the Rams were routing him by way of Hackensack. By the 
fourth quarter, he was no force at all. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with many who review publicized talent such as Taylor is that they 
tend to overdramatize each success. He brings down a quarterback -- and all of 
a sudden he has invented the sack. 
</P>
<P>
Other guys, meantime, are sacking quarterbacks with no fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
Often, this is how superstars are created. Once word escapes someone is good, 
others feel a need to enter into the fawning spirit. 
</P>
<P>
And the buildup leads to more recognition than is fair to competitors, who are 
on the job too. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Rams, Taylor played a big first quarter and a fair second quarter. 
In the third and fourth quarters, he was in the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Let history record all four quarters, not just the first. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the game on television, you were slightly staggered by the geographic 
ignorance of CBS, which kept linking the Rams photographically to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams reside in Anaheim, which resembles Hollywood as Texarkana resembles 
Rome. The Ram players don't live in Hollywood and they don't function there. 
Forty miles removed, they rarely even get there. 
</P>
<P>
If CBS wanted to be stupid altogether, it should have consummated a double 
play.

The woman who portrayed the kindly Aunt Bee on television's "The Andy Griffith 
Show" left her house to the town hospital and its contents to a center for 
public television, an attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who reads the will can see that she remembered those who remembered 
her at the last moments," attorney Sam Williams said about how Frances Bavier 
divided her $700,000 estate. 
</P>
<P>
The huge brick-and-stone house, where Bavier died in her sleep at 86 on Dec. 6, 
was bequeathed to Moore Memorial Hospital in Pinehurst, where the actress was 
treated several times. 
</P>
<P>
The contents of the house were donated to the University of North Carolina 
Center for Public Television, he said.

JUSTICES RULE FOX LIABLE FOR FILM BLOCK-BOOKING

<P>
The Supreme Court declined to review a lower court ruling today that held 20th 
Century Fox Film Corp. liable for a Fox employee's illegal block-booking of 
movies such as "Cocoon" and "Prizzi's Honor." 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, rejected the film company's appeal in the 
antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was whether a corporation can be charged with criminal contempt when 
one of its employees is found in contempt for violating a court-approved 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, in seeking high court review, argued that judges must consider any 
evidence a corporation has showing it did all it could to make sure its 
employees operate within the law. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals found such evidence was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Fox and Leila Goldstein, manager of the film company's branch office for 
Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Minneapolis, were convicted of criminal contempt 
for violating a 1951 consent decree in which Fox and other motion picture 
companies agreed to stop block-booking films. In the Fox case, Goldstein 
required booking agents to take a less desired film in order to receive a 
license for a more desired film. 
</P>
<P>
For example, an independent agent was required to play "Black Widow" in order 
to keep dates to play "Mannequin," and the same arrangement was required for 
the film pairings of "Johnny Dangerously" and "Flamingo Kid" as well as 
"Cocoon" and "Prizzi's Honor." 
</P>
<P>
The government argued against review.

A con man who says he's borrowing jewelry for Joan Rivers has made off with 
thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from at least two Manhattan stores, 
the syndicated talk-show host said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terribly sad," Rivers said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
"The store owners are nice, honest people, and this shouldn't have happened to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The well-dressed man in his 30s said he was borrowing the jewelry for Rivers to 
wear during a televised interview with arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, according 
to Jennifer Geertz, a spokeswoman for Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
The con man left two phone numbers with the stores, one at CBS and another that 
reaches a recorded message at offices of "The Joan Rivers Show." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real pro," Irene Kojen of the Peipers &amp; Kojen store told New York 
magazine. "He was so smooth that when he asked for one ring, I lent him two, so 
Joan would have a choice."

LIZ SMITH: REAGANS' RATING SOARS, BUT FOR UNPOPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"IN EXACTLY one year since leaving the White House, the Reagans have done the 
impossible. They have become the most unpopular First Couple in history," 
writes Sally Ogle Davis in Los Angeles magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Davis makes the point in her article titled "The Teflon Wears Thin" that Ronald 
Reagan left Washington with a healthy 68% approval rating. She says this rating 
no longer exists and cites the controversial $2-million trip by the Reagans to 
Japan . . . the former President's praise of the Japanese who might make "clean 
movies" to improve on Hollywood . . . Nancy's withdrawal of support from the 
drug rehabilitating Phoenix House . . . the coming IRS tax probe into the 
former First Lady's use of designer clothes . . . proliferating books against 
the Reagans . . . and Nancy's own memoir. 
</P>
<P>
THE TRUE "capper" in this Los Angeles magazine piece, however, is the 
revelation that the Reagans' estranged daughter, Patti Davis, "is reportedly 
spending time closeted with tell-all biographer Kitty Kelley for the latter's 
book on Nancy Reagan!" 
</P>
<P>
Kitty's Christmas card, by the by, features Nancy Reagan consulting a woman 
looking into a crystal ball and speaks of a big unauthorized biography that 
will tell all the former First Lady's deepest, darkest secrets. Inside the card 
there is a cartoon of Nancy wearing a button that reads: "Just Say Dough!" 
</P>
<P>
FAYE DUNAWAY is a star on the rebound. Her recent "Cold Sassy Tree" for the 
Turner TV network showed Faye at her most subtle, and with terrific results. 
Now the actress is getting hot advance word-of-mouth for her portrayal of a 
former TV evangelist in the soon due "The Handmaiden's Tale," based on Margaret 
Atwood's futuristic thriller. 
</P>
<P>
Faye's career derailed after "Mommie Dearest" in 1980, although I've never 
understood why. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEGRO Ensemble Company is the nation's oldest, consistently producing 
theater organization. It opens its 23rd season on Jan. 13 with one of two plays 
from Charles Fuller's cycle of dramas. On the 11th, we get "Jonquil" and then 
in February comes "Burner's Frolic." Last season, Fuller did "Sally and 
Prince," dramatizing the turbulent, violence-ridden years after the Civil War 
and the emancipation of the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
These plays are independent of each other, separated by 10 years in time and 
with entirely different casts. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "A 
Soldier's Story" is now working on the screenplay for "Malcolm X," to star 
Denzel Washington.

PHIL COLLINS SHRUGS OFF STARDOM

<P>
British singer Phil Collins knows he doesn't fit a pop superstar profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to think of myself as a star," Collins said recently. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me nervous. When you start thinking in star terms, you start thinking 
you're better than everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, whose latest solo album ". . .But Seriously" hit the top of the charts 
three weeks after its release, said his success has little to do with his 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I look like someone who's going to set feminine hearts aflutter?" the 
balding 38-year-old asked. 
</P>
<P>
But the author of eight No. 1 tunes during the past decade and a member of the 
rock group Genesis bristles when critics call him a lightweight on social 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Many media critics said his recent No. 1 hit, "Another Day in Paradise," is 
unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
"How dare these critics say I don't know what I'm talking about. I know what I 
see for myself, what I read about and see on TV. I don't have to be homeless to 
be touched by what's happening to these people," he said.

IAN CHARLESON, 40; STAR OF FILM 'CHARIOTS OF FIRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Charleson, the Scottish actor who starred in the film "Chariots of Fire" as 
an Olympic sprinter who refused to compete on a Sunday for religious reasons, 
has died of complications from AIDS, a spokesman said Sunday in London. 
</P>
<P>
Charleson, 40, died Saturday at his London home of septicemia, an affliction 
caused by microorganisms in the blood, said Michael Whitehall, the actor's 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Death came "following a courageous struggle with the AIDS virus," Whitehall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who had recently won critical acclaim for his portrayal of "Hamlet" 
at London's National Theater, became an international star in the 1981 film 
"Chariots of Fire" -- that year's Academy Award-winner for best picture. 
Charleson played Scottish missionary and sprinter Eric Liddell. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate enough to see Ian's last performance, as Hamlet at the 
National Theater nine weeks ago," Whitehall said. "After nearly four hours on 
stage he was given a standing ovation by a huge and appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that he was exhausted, but his courage, not only in being on that 
stage but giving us the performance of his life, left our applause and cheers 
seeming very inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lost a much-loved, greatly respected and hugely talented young actor." 
</P>
<P>
In "Gandhi," the Oscar-winner for best picture in 1982, Charleson played 
Charlie Andrews, a priest who traveled to South Africa to join the passive 
resistance movement launched by Mohandas K. Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the film's more memorable scenes, Charleson as the priest and Ben 
Kingsley as the future Mahatma encounter a group of threatening young white 
toughs on a South African street. Andrews and Gandhi seem assured of a 
thrashing until one of the boys' mothers orders him to head off to his job. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fisher, an opposition Labor Party spokesman on the arts, said Charleson's 
widely acclaimed performance as Hamlet "indicated that an enormous career lay 
ahead of him. This is a terrible tragedy for the British theater." 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times said Charleson's Hamlet is "a civilized, mature, witty and 
eminently decent prince with whom one would willingly discuss architecture. . . 
. Mr. Charleson gives us the reasonable man surrounded by unreasonableness, the 
civilized human plunged into barbaric nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Charleson was born in Edinburgh on Aug. 11, 1949. The son of a printer, he won 
a scholarship to the Scottish capital's Royal High School and went on to study 
architecture at Edinburgh University. 
</P>
<P>
His interest in acting developed, Charleson once said, when he discovered he 
had the ability "to make people laugh and make them cry." 
</P>
<P>
He studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and began his stage 
career in London at the Young Vic Theater from 1972 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
His performances with the National Theater included roles in "Julius Caesar" 
and "Volpone" in 1977, and "Guys and Dolls" in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He received particular acclaim for his performances in two American plays at 
the National -- Sam Shepard's "Fool for Love" in 1985, and a 1988 production of 
Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," in which he played Brick. 
</P>
<P>
One of his recent television roles was the lead in "Troubles," a film version 
of J.G. Farrell's book about Ireland's fight for independence. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a private family funeral in Scotland later this week and a 
memorial service in London later in the year, Whitehall said.
