NEWSMAKERS: ELVIS AT 54: STILL EARNING INTEREST

 -- If the king of rock 'n' roll were alive today, he would have celebrated his 
54th birthday on Sunday. However, George Klein, one of Elvis Presley's school 
classmates and now a disc jockey, chose to remember the day by treating Elvis' 
fans to a birthday cake and a four-hour radio talk show from Elvis' mansion, 
Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A breakfast buffet at Heartbreak Hotel was also 
served, with bacon cooked the way the King liked it -- extra crispy. Klein did 
his best to put to rest rumors that Elvis did not die in August, 1977, and is 
still alive. "I know that Elvis Presley is really dead," Klein told one of his 
callers. "I was a pallbearer at Elvis' funeral. . . . These terrible rumors are 
the most cruel and tasteless things people have said about Presley." Meanwhile, 
attesting to the staying power of the Presley magic, Forbes magazine reported 
that the Presley estate made $15 million in 1988 from record sales, licensing 
fees and tourist visits to Graceland. The magazine said that the only 
entertainers who earned more than the Presley estate last year were Michael 
Jackson, Madonna, Prince and George Michael.

 -- According to former Rep. John W. Jenrette of South Carolina, the 
shoplifting charge is a "silly, silly mistake." But authorities in Fairfax 
County, Va., think otherwise. Jenrette, who served 13 months of a two-year 
prison sentence for an Abscam conviction in 1980, has been ordered to appear 
for trial on Feb. 1 on charges of shoplifting a pair of rubber shoes and 
altering price tags on a pair of pants and a shirt last month in Baileys 
Crossroads, Va. Each misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of up to a 
year in jail. Jenrette, 52, who lives in Myrtle Beach, S. C., said in a 
newspaper story Sunday that he had tried on the shoes and, with the other 
articles in hand, walked out of the store to check on an announcement that 
illegally parked cars were being towed away. He was apprehended by security 
guards as he stepped outside. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LuLa Ellis said Sunday her Philadelphia, Miss., theater will not show the 
film "Mississippi Burning," despite the fact that the fictionalized account of 
the deaths of three civil rights workers is drawn from events in the town 25 
years ago. "We're not going to show it. No way. It's not worth it," said Ellis, 
who owns the Ellis theater, the only movie house in the town of 6,800 people. 
"I just see no reason why we should play it. It's just a mess." She said church 
groups had threatened to boycott the theater if it showed the movie. The 
release of the film, set for Friday, has refocused national attention on the 
community. JAMES MARNELL

JOHN LAWE; HEAD OF TRANSIT WORKERS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Lawe, an Irish immigrant who rose from bus cleaner to become president of 
the International Transport Workers Union, died at his Bronx home Thursday 
after a long bout with cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken man with a lilting brogue, Lawe led transit workers in New York 
City on a disastrous 11-day strike in 1980 that shut down the bus and subway 
system and brought Mayor Edward I. Koch to the Brooklyn Bridge to announce to 
thousands of commuters walking to work that he would refuse to give in to union 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
It was a costly walkout that saw the government impose $1 million in fines 
against the union under a state law that restricts strikes in the public 
sector. The union was all but broken and won few, if any, concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The union eventually agreed to contract language that, in essence, gave up its 
right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ireland, Lawe came to the United States in 1949 and got a job as a bus 
cleaner at the now defunct Fifth Avenue Coach Co. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his leading the 1980 strike, Lawe was considered a conservative force 
in the once-militant union and was seen as part of the old guard of 
Irish-American labor leaders in a union whose membership by the 1970s was 
heavily black and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lawe became president of the union's international, only the fourth 
TWU leader since it was founded in 1934. He will be replaced by the union's 
executive vice president, George Leitz, union officials said.

JACK ROBERTS, 68; FOUNDED LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Roberts, one of the founders of the Carson/Roberts advertising agency and 
later an executive at Ogilvy &amp; Mather after the two firms merged, died 
Friday at his home from a long-term respiratory illness. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who was born in Portland, attended the University of Washington and 
the Art Center School in Seattle before serving five years as a pilot with the 
Army Air Corps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, Roberts formed the Carson/Roberts agency with ad man Ralph Carson, 
which grew into Los Angeles' largest advertising firm until it merged with 
Ogilvy &amp; Mather in 1971. Among his clients were Gallo wines, Gates Learjet, 
Mattel, Max Factor and Baskin-Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
During Roberts' tenure at Carson/Roberts, he was involved in a high-profile 
advertising campaign in Eastern newspapers to persuade the Brooklyn Dodgers to 
move to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was creative director at his own firm and worked as director of public 
service advertising at Ogilvy. Author and illustrator of books on advertising 
and tennis and magazine articles for AdAge, Adweek and Business Week, Roberts 
also served as president of the LA Art Directors Club, the International Design 
Education Foundation and the International Design Conference in Aspen. He won 
numerous advertising awards and was named to advisory boards at UCLA, USC and 
the Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is survived by his wife, Dian, sons Thane and Kevin and daughters 
Stephanie and Michele.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CUP COMMERCIALIZATION HEADED FOR THE ASHCAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dennis Conner won the big boat race, but New Zealander Michael Fay triumphed in 
the battle of one-upmanship when Conner's catamaran displayed the Marlboro logo 
as one of his corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Fay countered by hosting a sail on his boat with a huge surgeon-general's 
warning. Conner, after all, had done charity work for the American Cancer 
Society and poses as an apostle of the healthy life style. 
</P>
<P>
Nasty, nasty words were muttered toward the San Diego skipper -- words like 
hypocrite and money-grubber. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that the Marlboro logo was also emblazoned on the marking buoys, 
the press center, Sail America stationery and clothing and the pontoons of a 
large TV screen floating off Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced Friday between the San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail 
America Foundation to govern the 1991 America's Cup races off San Diego says 
that, unless Marlboro mounts and wins a legal challenge, there will be no ads 
for tobacco products on anything under the control of the America's Cup 
Organizing Committee, such as the buoys, press center, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Conner's controversial sail was not addressed directly. But the 
agreement says that advertising on sails will be allowed only with the consent 
of the ACOC and the challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Inescapable conclusion: The next America's Cup, sails and all, will be 
smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working With a Net 
</P>
<P>
Anne Boe, the Encinitas-based guru of upward mobility, will have her first book 
out soon: "Is Your Net-Working?" co-written with Dr. Bettie Youngs of Solana 
Beach. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons of New York, available in bookstores 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Boe, the former placement director at Grossmont College, preaches the gospel of 
success through "working smarter, not harder." Sample chapter of her book: 
"Quid Pro Quo (Or, How Useful Are You to Someone Else?)" 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be prepared," Boe says. "You've got to know what. But you've 
also got to know who, and what are the power bases, and what are the means of 
internal communication." 
</P>
<P>
Along with writing, Boe is also in demand as a keynote speaker. She's spoken 
recently to conventions of the Tupperware Jubilees, the multilevel Marketing 
International Assn., Meeting Planners International and the Council of 
Logistics Management. 
</P>
<P>
"Networking is the business tool of the 1990s if you want to keep the 
competitive edge," Boe says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital's Liquid Asset 
</P>
<P>
When talk-show hostess Oprah Winfrey went public last November about how she 
lost 67 pounds, the phone started to ring at Tri-City Medical Center in 
Oceanside. And ring and ring. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hundreds of calls," says hospital official Jennifer Velez. People 
wanted the same program as Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-City is the only North County hospital with the Optifast liquid diet 
program used by Oprah. It combines exercise, nutrition education and counseling 
to provide the willpower necessary for weight reduction. 
</P>
<P>
The Oprah-boost was so big that Tri-City, starting next week, will offer a 
scaled-down version called Optilite, a 16-week, $1,495 program for people who 
need to lose 20 to 40 pounds. Officials have also hunkered down for another 
siege of phone calls, because Oprah has just gone on the interview circuit -- 
"PM Magazine," "Entertainment Tonight," etc. -- with her tale of tonnage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep It Brief 
</P>
<P>
The term legal brief is a misnomer. As any judge will tell you, most of them 
are anything but brief and instead ramble on for pages and pages, sometimes 
through arguments unfathomable to anyone but the author. 
</P>
<P>
So the federal judges in San Diego voted last week to establish a 
"less-is-more" policy: No brief in a civil case can exceed 25 pages, without 
special consent of the judge. And the reason for requesting an extension had 
better be very persuasive. One jurist suggested: 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should just tell the attorneys: You can write as long as you want, 
but we stop reading after 25 pages."

BABY FOUND SAFE IN SEWER AFTER MOTHER STRUCK BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-month-old girl apparently spent two nights in a sewer pipe near the 
Mexican border after her mother was hit by a car while crossing Interstate 5 
with a group of about 20 illegal aliens, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The child, wrapped in a yellow blanket, was being carried by another member of 
the group, but apparently was abandoned after her mother, Onecima Lopez, 30, 
was struck Friday evening by a hit-and-run driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought they were going to deliver her daughter to a relative in Los 
Angeles, but they didn't," said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego 
Police Department. "We don't know why the child was abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez's companions apparently continued north, leaving her near the highway and 
placing the baby in the sewer pipe nearby, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Group Member Killed 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the group, Antonio Mendez, 54, was struck and killed by the 
same car that hit Lopez, Young said. The identity of the driver is not known 
and the vehicle, which was southbound on the freeway, was described only as 
red, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez suffered two broken legs, but managed to crawl to a highway over-crossing 
at Dairy Mart Road after she was struck and spent Friday night under the 
structure, according to Officer Randy Young of the California Highway Patrol. 
She was found Saturday morning by a passer-by. 
</P>
<P>
But her daughter, Sandra, was not found until Sunday morning, by another group 
of aliens making their way north. They took the child and some formula that had 
been placed nearby and flagged down a passing cabdriver, who delivered the baby 
to the police station on San Ysidro Boulevard, Robinson said. Police officers 
fed the child some formula and rushed her to Scripps Hospital in Chula Vista, 
where doctors found her dehydrated but in remarkably good condition. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was in fair condition in the hospital's intensive care unit Sunday and 
was expected to undergo surgery today, according to Judy Casto, nursing 
supervisor. Casto said Lopez had a joyous reunion Sunday with her daughter, who 
was later transferred to Children's Hospital, where she was to be observed for 
a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers had searched for the child Saturday after Lopez contacted her 
relatives in Los Angeles and learned that the baby had not arrived, but were 
unable to find her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the baby was located Sunday morning, police showed Lopez a snapshot of 
the child and she identified it as hers, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The case will be turned over to immigration authorities, who must decide 
whether to deport Lopez and her child, who are from the state of Michoacan in 
the interior of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasing Problem 
</P>
<P>
The incident also points up the increasingly serious problem of illegal aliens 
who are maimed or killed as they dash across border-area highways at night. The 
traffic accidents have become a top priority with the CHP, which reports 
several such deaths each month. A record 10 deaths of undocumented aliens 
occurred in October. 
</P>
<P>
While most border cities have similar problems, the situation in the San Diego 
area is particularly serious. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of pedestrians who cross the border near San Diego, and the 
major California freeway systems that run to the Mexican border, combine to 
cause an unusually high death and injury rate. Many of the cases are 
hit-and-run incidents in which the drivers are never located, police say. 
Sometimes the bodies are so badly mangled that the victims are never 
identified.

STATE OF THE EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your editorial "Children of Calamity" (Dec. 22) and Lawrence E. Bruce 
Jr.'s article on Third World debt (Op-Ed Page, Dec. 22): 
</P>
<P>
"We have met the enemy and he is us." While the UNICEF report makes for sad 
reading, it is not nearly as important as the worldwatch "State of the Earth" 
report. 
</P>
<P>
UNICEF would have us stop sending axes to the Third World and start sending 
chain saws and bulldozers to cut the rain forests down faster. We send oral 
rehydration kits for 2 year olds, then we have to send boatloads of grain for 
12 year olds, then the 18 year olds become either rebels or refugees. The 
leftists blow up the power lines while the rightists kill the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
This planet will support 1 billion living like Americans, 2 billion living like 
Western Europeans, 3 billion living like Eastern Europeans, 5 billion living 
like Chinese or 10 billion living like Ethiopians. If we insist on breeding 
like rabbits, we will wind up living like rabbits; a handful of vegetation per 
day, a dirt house and no clean water. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce says we must import more from the Third World, so should we turn Africa 
into a giant strip mine? He calls for "real aid" and "essential services." What 
is really needed all over the world is a bottle of the new French birth-control 
pills in every slum shanty and village hut. China is improving the quality of 
life of its citizens and what is its reward? We call its population control 
policies "draconian" and cut off funding. They have learned you can have 
quality of life or quantity of life, not both.

HARD TIMES FOR TRADE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intensifying trade war between the United States and the European 
Community, this time triggered by controversy over the use of growth hormones 
in beef production, raises doubts about the ability of the 95 members of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to negotiate a critically important new 
agreement. The situation greatly increases the pressure on President-elect 
George Bush's newly designated trade representative, Carla Hills, to come up 
with some quick answers. 
</P>
<P>
In this case American stubbornness created the problem. The European Community 
offered every opportunity to American meat producers to meet European health 
standards on beef. Only after an extra year of negotiations failed did the 
Europeans implement the rule. Beef produced with growth hormones was banned for 
human consumption effective Jan. 1. American officials insist that there is no 
health hazard and accuse the Europeans of creating an illegal non-tariff 
barrier to U.S. imports. The Europeans respond by pointing to consumer demands, 
fully supported by the European Parliament, for a no-risk approach. It seems 
clear that this is not a device to bar American meat and that Europeans, and 
any other consumers, have every right to demand hormone-free beef. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Yeutter, President Reagan's trade representative, has chosen the path 
of confrontation, retaliating with 100% tariffs worth about $100 million a year 
on seven European Community exports to the United States. Now the Europeans, 
understandably, are considering counter-retaliation that would almost certainly 
have a disproportionate effect on California farmers by including walnuts and 
dried fruit. 
</P>
<P>
A similar breakdown in negotiations marked the midterm ministerial review of 
the new GATT round last month in Montreal. Member nations agreed on 11 of 15 
major expansions of trade, including trade in services, of particular 
importance to the United States. But they failed to agree on four others. One 
of those, agriculture, divides the Europeans from the United States. Reagan has 
insisted that there be a timetable to end agriculture subsidies that distort 
trade. The Europeans have resisted. Only a major compromise is likely to break 
the impasse, but compromise is preferable to derailing the new GATT round. 
</P>
<P>
Events in Montreal forced the postponement of decision-making until April, with 
negotiators continuing to search for solutions at a lower level. That delay 
need not disrupt the GATT schedule. But it is a risky maneuver. In effect, 
Hills has just three months to accomplish what Yeutter was unable to do in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's commitment to phase out farm subsidies is a constructive proposal at a 
time when the United States and the European Community have been putting as 
much as $50 billion a year into farm supports. These subsidies dislocate supply 
and prices. The European and American export subsidies have made matters worse. 
But there is room for compromise, as illustrated by the proposals of the Cairns 
Group -- Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and Canada -- the major farm 
producers that do not use export subsidies. Their plan would phase out export 
subsidies, import restrictions and domestic price supports while maintaining 
domestic production controls. That appears much better than the costly and 
wasteful European and American programs. 
</P>
<P>
There is some reason for optimism. The importance of the economic relationship 
is appreciated on both sides of the Atlantic. Last year trade between the 
United States and the European Community reached $150 billion, and investments 
totaled $280 billion. As Secretary of State George P. Shultz recently 
commented, "This is a tremendous relationship of great importance to both the 
United States and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Tariff wars before the beef-hormone dispute were settled because the Europeans 
understand as well as the Americans the importance of their trading 
relationship. The prospect for agreement on the new GATT is enhanced by a 
growing understanding of how much is to be gained by agreement, and how much 
lost by failure.

HELMETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever there was a case for passage of a law requiring helmets on bike riders, 
I saw it recently. As I approached an intersection in West Los Angeles, I saw a 
man wearing a helmet fly through the air and bounce on his head. A car had just 
hit his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
He sat up stunned and in a few seconds began patting his helmet as if giving 
thanks that it had done its job to protect him. He was able to stand up and 
walk from the intersection to the curb. I am sure he feels that his helmet 
saved him from serious injury or death.

BRITISH VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an Englishman who has spent the past two weeks on vacation with relatives 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I am writing to comment on the subject of proportional representation, as 
raised by Matthew Shugart (letter, Jan. 1). He claims that Britain's electoral 
system "works," although the majority party almost never has a majority of 
votes. It does not work. 
</P>
<P>
We desperately need proportional representation and the coalitions that are 
likely to result from it. Only these can rescue us from the extremes of 
pendulum politics in which each government tends to undo the work of its 
predecessor. (This tendency is much more marked than in America, with its 
checks and balances). It has also intensified the divisions between the 
prosperous south and the economically disadvantaged north of England, Scotland 
and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
This apart, what kind of democracy can we really claim to be when, in the 1987 
election, 43% of the votes cast for Conservatives gained 60% of the seats in 
Parliament, but over 20% who voted for the center alliance gained 3% of the 
seats?

WHEN WE VALUE INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS, WE'LL BE RICHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STANLEY THOMPSON Jr., Stanley Thompson Jr. is a 10th-grade magnet student at 
Los Angeles High School.

The education system in the United States is failing. Most well-informed people 
know this. Some say that government is at fault for not providing more funds to 
education programs. This is true; the government does not place a high enough 
priority on education. Others blame teachers for the schools' failure. Teachers 
may be partly to blame, but their fault is the least. The responsibility for 
learning lies with the student. So the real problem is in student attitude, and 
in American attitude in general. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: Who is most likely to win a popularity contest -- a star athlete 
or a straight-A student? The answer is obvious -- the star athlete. But why? 
There are countries in the world where education is treasured. I'm not saying 
that the straight-A student would necessarily win the contest in those 
countries, but he would run a close second. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the United States and those other countries is that 
American students lack a love of learning. They generally feel that being sent 
to school is done to them, not for them. It is this lack of love for education 
that impedes the progress of education. No matter how gifted the teacher, a 
student will not learn if he or she does not want to. There is not one student 
who is enthusiastic about learning who will do poorly in school. The reason is 
that an eager student will work with, not against, a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
There is an attitude among students that teachers are supposed to make classes 
easy so that the student can pass them with a minimum of effort. If a test 
seems too hard, cheating is acceptable, they say, because they shouldn't be 
expected to learn all that "unimportant stuff," like dates in history, or the 
codes for chemical elements. 
</P>
<P>
Why are there very few students who treasure learning? Partly because American 
society projects the idea to young people that it is fine to be mediocre. Too 
many people are satisfied with being average; they feel that average is enough. 
There is no motivation to strive for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, there is a feeling that being in the pursuit of excellence is not 
normal, and those who engage in that pursuit are not normal. This attitude 
tells young people that they will not be socially accepted if they seek 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is slipping as a political and economic power because every 
year there are fewer graduates from high school who have the drive to achieve 
excellence. Most, it seems, are content to find a quiet niche in life and stay 
there in silence and apathy. Those are the citizens who won't vote or take an 
interest in social issues. They are the ones who don't care to make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for our national deficit of sharp, determined minds is that many 
never took it into their hearts as children that the pursuit of excellence is 
the most worthwhile venture. It is easier to settle for C's than strive for 
A's. To give up rather than persevere. To flicker out instead of shining 
brightly. 
</P>
<P>
How can the problem be solved? The answer is not simple. The only way to remedy 
our educational problems is to change the way people think about learning. That 
is a Herculean task indeed, for trying to reverse the negative course that we 
are on as a result of a collective lack of internal fire is like trying to 
reverse the spin of the Earth. The great inertia of the problem is overwhelming 
the forces trying to counteract it, and the problem keeps increasing. Each time 
a student chooses an easy class over a challenging one, or decides that a 
diploma is not worth the effort of staying in school, or settles for being 
ordinary in order to be accepted, the immensity of this problem grows greater. 
The need to confront it is urgent. Like an unrestrained object hurtling through 
space, the problem of mediocrity in education will be unstoppable, driving our 
nation down the path of self-destruction or other disastrous end. 
</P>
<P>
I have painted a picture of an educational depression, a depression from which 
we might not return. I see a light, however, a beacon: It is shining from all 
the teachers who are determined to keep the darkness from engulfing us, from 
all the students who thirst for knowledge and dare to aim high, from all the 
little children only just starting their education, and from all those who 
envision a society where the extraordinary person, by today's standards, is 
unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
It is to these precious few that I plead: Make strong your light and dispel the 
great darkness. Fuel your mental fire with love of learning and use this fire 
to provide intellectual illumination and warmth to your neighbors. Make it your 
goal to defeat this ignorance that threatens a life we love. Dare to make a 
difference. Can we afford not to?

MORALITY OF MARKETPLACE IS FIT SUBJECT FOR BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
INAUGURAL SHOULD SET THE TONE AGAINST GREED AND SLEAZE IN FINANCIAL ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY E. GARTEN, Jeffrey E. Garten is president of Eliot Group Inc., an 
investment banking firm in New York, and worked in the Nixon, Ford and Carter 
administrations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. pleaded guilty 
to six counts of mail, wire and securities fraud a few weeks ago, a sad chapter 
was added to the excesses of Wall Street in the late 1980s. As he takes office, 
George Bush should speak out against such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel saga, which follows convictions of Ivan Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, 
among others, is not over. There are civil charges to be settled with the 
Securities Exchange Commission; the fate of Michael Milken, Drexel's junk-bond 
king, is still undetermined. But it is not too early for a President to set the 
tone for ethics in the financial marketplace, and the upcoming inaugural 
address would be the right time and place. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other scandals around, of course -- bribery of political 
officials, drug-running in schools, malpractice in hospitals, fraud in the 
savings-and-loan system. But Drexel-type sins deserve special presidential 
attention because of their potential impact on all parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Wall Street is not just a few square blocks in Manhattan. It is not 
just young traders who are glued to their computer monitors by day and who race 
around in BMWs at night. Nor is it simply the battlefield for RJR Nabisco-type 
deals, in which big egos and big money clash. 
</P>
<P>
What is at stake is the integrity of the nation's capital markets, the 
mechanism that sets rates for mortgages and car loans and turns savings 
accounts into schools and roads. It's these same markets that deflate or jack 
up the dollar and hence help determine the competitive position of American 
industries in the world arena. And it is on these markets that pension plans 
and trust funds depend for their safety and growth. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, this financial system is no more than hundreds of thousands of men 
and women, buying and selling bonds and stocks, and making decisions about 
someone else's money. What could be more basic for the President than to say, 
simply, that he expects that the standards of these people should be as high as 
his well-known expectations for public servants. 
</P>
<P>
In upcoming congressional hearings, we will hear a lot about the 
conflict-of-interest dilemmas facing the big investment banks in an era of 
regulatory laissez faire and vicious international competition. It will become 
clear, too, that Drexel's sins are not at all typical of Wall Street behavior. 
But lawmakers will be bogged down in technically arcane issues, and it will 
take years for new legislation to emerge, if it ever does. In the meantime, the 
only way to at least arrest growing public cynicism is for someone who counts 
to address the American people on the basic questions of right and wrong in the 
financial arena. 
</P>
<P>
In our system that "someone" can only be the President. No senator or 
congressman has the national standing. The mandate of top regulators is too 
specialized. Business leaders are lying low. 
</P>
<P>
Morals should not be legislated, but top officials can have an impact by 
highlighting their importance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Bush should not wrestle with the nuances of insider trading, 
self-dealing, or any specific case such as Drexel; these are matters best left 
to the SEC and others. But he could express disapproval of greed, which 
inflicts damage on the public. He could instruct the Congress and the 
regulatory agencies to give priority to rooting out conflict of interest in the 
financial marketplace. He could ensure the investors on Main Street -- who have 
been leaving the stock market in large numbers -- that in his eyes the 
financial markets should not be rigged. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he wanted a kinder and gentler nation; presumably this means one 
whose major institutions are fairer as well. He said that he wanted to be known 
as the education President; surely this extends beyond improving the nation's 
science and math curricula to the enhancement of the population's most basic 
values. 
</P>
<P>
A presidential message should not upset the markets if it is put in the context 
of continued support for sensible financial deregulation and the recognition 
that the overwhelming number of men and women who constitute the market are 
"clean." On the contrary, it would be the clearest evidence of a man who 
understands what it is to lead. 
</P>
<P>
After all, modern-day Presidents have little leeway to do much but inspire. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt inspired Americans to persevere. John F. Kennedy 
instilled pride in public service. Ronald Reagan encouraged self-reliance and 
entrepreneurialism. 
</P>
<P>
But our current President seemed oblivious to ethics in the business world and 
thereby helped stimulate the worst type of excesses. This gives Bush a great 
opportunity. He can build on Reagan's economic revolution, and at the same time 
distinguish himself by saying "no" to sleaze in the capital markets.

REST PAYS OFF FOR WEARY SOCKERS IN 6-2 VICTORY OVER TIRED LAZERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers, who enjoy a day off as much as anyone else, beat a tired Los 
Angeles Lazers team, 6-2, Sunday night at the Sports Arena, then had trouble 
explaining why it had been so easy. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of simple statistics helped provide the answer. The Sockers, when 
playing for a second consecutive day this season, are 0-3. Under the same 
circumstances, the Lazers, who beat Baltimore Saturday night and then 
sleepwalked into town, are now 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Presented with these fool-proof numbers, the answers flowed much more easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's something to that," midfielder Branko Segota said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Coach Ron Newman: "That's a good statistic." 
</P>
<P>
At least it worked out in San Diego's favor Sunday, in front of 7,392. 
</P>
<P>
The statistic didn't work in their favor Friday night, when the Sockers, 
playing for a second consecutive night, went flat against Baltimore and lost, 
4-2? 
</P>
<P>
"We were tired that night," Segota said. 
</P>
<P>
And, so it was that the Lazers were bleary-eyed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers led, 3-2, going into the fourth quarter, but scored 3 unanswered 
goals as the Lazers drifted into deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers, meanwhile, managed only 3 shots in the final quarter. Afterward, 
even Lazer Coach Keith Tozker was having trouble keeping his thoughts straight. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't fatigued," he explained. "We were just mentally tired." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, meanwhile, were alert. Losing to the Lazers Thursday night in 
overtime and to Baltimore Friday had put them in a funk. 
</P>
<P>
A third consecutive loss would have put them into fifth place in the Major 
Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys knew they couldn't lose another one," Newman said. "There was a sense 
of urgency before this one." 
</P>
<P>
Things became a bit more urgent after the Sockers (9-9) fell behind, 1-0, 
midway through the first quarter. Goalkeeper Victor Nogueira let Hector 
Marinaro's easy roller sneak between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Lazer goalkeeper Jim Gorsek returned the favor, however. 
Gorsek tried to kick away a rolling ball at the left of the goal and whiffed, 
allowing it to roll to Zoran Karic, standing alone in front. With nothing but 
net to shoot at, Karic tied the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams traded goals in the second quarter, the Sockers' power play 
produced a 3-2 lead early in the third quarter on Karic's shot just under the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
The power play, which had clicked only twice in the previous 5 games, is now 
only 7 for 33 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Segota scored early in the fourth quarter, Brian Quinn passed to Ralph Black 
for a goal midway through the quarter, and Segota scored on a penalty kick late 
in the quarter to wrap up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We seemed to have a commitment from everybody for an entire game," midfielder 
Brian Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
And as a result, they're back to the .500 mark and snug in fourth place, one 
game behind Wichita. The Lazers are 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 10 minutes of this one was relatively easy," Segota admitted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
For the sixth time in seven years, the Sockers received indoor championship 
rings before Sunday night's game. Among the no-shows from last season's 
champions were Hugo Perez and Juli Veee. Jacques Ladouceur arrived late. Zoltan 
Toth, meanwhile, got his ring, then told Coach Ron Newman he wasn't feeling 
well enough to start the game against the Lazers. So Newman had to go with 
Victor Nogueira at the last minute. . . . Paul Dougherty, whose 
consecutive-games streak ended at a team-record 91 games when he didn't play 
Friday night against the Baltimore Blast, returned to action Sunday. Defender 
George Fernandez, who has played in 50 consecutive games, now has the Sockers' 
longest streak. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Crow earned his 100th career point as a Socker when he assisted on Zoran 
Karic's goal in the first quarter. . . . Defender Chris Chueden played for the 
first time in 8 games Sunday. Chueden, who had only 1 point in the Sockers' 
first 10 games, was benched by Newman after the Sockers started the season 3-7. 
Chueden then couldn't get back into the lineup when the Sockers embarked on a 
5-game winning streak. . . . The Sockers play at home only one more time this 
month, next Saturday night against the Wichita Wings. Four of the Sockers' next 
5 games are on the road, where they are 3-6 on the season. . . . After their 
6-2 victory over the Lazers, the Sockers have still scored the least amount of 
goals in the league (69) and given up the least (65).

JACK SMITH: A COMPUTER SNAFU -- BUT NO BYTING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living as I do in a thoroughly computerized world, I sometimes feel as if I'm 
flying through flak, always in danger of being zapped by some errant byte. 
</P>
<P>
Computers are wonderful, until humans make them err. When human error is 
compounded by a computer, the resulting snafu is almost impossible to untangle. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's mail, my wife and I received a bill that makes us feel not only 
wronged, but helpless. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bill from a Pasadena radiology laboratory showing that I owe $231 for 
X-rays of my chest (two views), cervical spine, shoulder (complete) and left 
shoulder. I had no such X-rays made. 
</P>
<P>
What is more exasperating, the bill notes that the radiologist has already 
filed a claim with Medicare. "Payment will come directly to you. Balance now 
due and payable." 
</P>
<P>
So we are in the position of trying to convince the radiologist lab that I 
received no such service, but, worse, we will have to return payment to 
Medicare, if any is indeed forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how hard it is to undo any transaction with Medicare once it has 
been done? 
</P>
<P>
Recently, my wife applied for credit with an Eastern mail-order house, only to 
receive a form rejection listing a number of bad credit citations. Since our 
credit is A No. 1, I called the credit agency in some anger, only to be 
roadblocked by an answering machine. I would have to write, if I had any 
complaint, and ask for a copy of my credit report. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote a letter in some heat, which was of course a mistake. Credit agencies 
are not moved by their subjects' anger. Through private means I finally found a 
working phone number and talked to an assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that my wife's record had been transgressed by a woman with a 
similar name and an atrocious credit record. She had actually been assigned my 
wife's social security number. 
</P>
<P>
That was straightened out in time, and my wife was notified by the mail-order 
house that she was now in good standing. It was more than embarrassing; it was 
frightening. (There was one advantage: for awhile, at least, my wife had credit 
with one less mail-order house.) 
</P>
<P>
Steven W. Wright writes that he recently sent a check for 62 cents to settle an 
alleged delinquency in his student loan account. The Student Loan Serving 
Center, in Minneapolis, advised him that the delinquency had been extant since 
May, 1987, but couldn't say whether his check had been short that amount or the 
center had erred. 
</P>

His alleged delinquency was reported to the U.S. Department of Education, which 
sent a warning (with the word WARNING in 1-inch type) that if he didn't settle 
up his account he would be declared in DEFAULT and "referred to the Federal 
Government for further collection activity." (Not "for collection," but "for 
further collection activity." Typical Department of Education gobbledygook.)

One is about a man who applied for gasoline coupons in the war so he could get 
to and from his essential war work. His application was denied and he was told 
to use public transportation. He replied that the first bus left too late for 
him to get to his job on time. Then he received a small number of coupons and a 
letter that said: "After due consideration, your application has been allowed 
and X units are attached to allow you to use your car to place of work only; 
the return to your residence to be made by public transport."

A man who had lost a leg in the war was allowed an extra soap ration, but he 
received the coupons for six months only. When he applied, in six months, for 
more coupons, he was told that he could have them if he signed a certificate 
that his leg was still off.

One wonders how we won the war.

MARYLOUISE OATES: ON HOLD TILL THE REAGANS HEAD WEST

Call this time Reagan-adjacent, with many of the usual giant January parties 
somehow pushed into February -- and the Los Angeles social schedule set by 
events a whole coast away. 
</P>
<P>
Among the interesting bits and pieces lined up is a jet-back from the inaugural 
festivities Jan. 21 by art collector Fred Weisman and his steady Billie Milam 
to inaugurate the Weisman Art Foundation's international workshop on art and 
architecture. There will be a splashy party at Weisman's Holmby Hills home to 
introduce the workshop participants to what one staffer describes as "members 
of Los Angeles' cultural elite." The workshop, the first in an on-going series 
of Weisman-sponsored gatherings on contemporary art-related topics, will 
include artists like John Baldessari and Anthony Caro, along with architects 
such as Frank Gehry, Cesar Pelli, Michael Rotondi and Michael Graves. 
</P>
<P>
Social observers must mark this party-cum-workshop weekend as the next step in 
the escalating competition among wealthy and interested collectors. Now the 
action has moved from private "boutique museums" to privately-sponsored 
"boutique workshops." 
</P>
<P>
Next . . . 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAY'S THE THING -- And, in his last year as the Ahmanson Theatre's 
artistic director, Bobby Fryer seems determined to show just how much theater 
is indeed his thing. A good example: The Wednesday night premiere of Stephen 
Sondheim's fairy-tale musical, "Into the Woods," starring Cleo Laine and 
Charlotte Rae, will be attended by more stars than your average awards show. 
Look for Carol Channing, Diahann Carroll, Roddy McDowall, Lucie Arnaz and 
Laurence Luckinbill, Carl Reiner, Brenda Vaccaro, Michael York and literally 
dozens of other names. . . . To bring a little magic into the lives of some 
not-so-star-crossed people, the Ahmanson is offering two tickets for the price 
of one for the Thursday matinee. The only catch -- bring a non-perishable food 
or household item with you to the box-office when you buy your ticket. All 
contributions go to the "Necessities of Life Program" of AIDS Project/L.A. It's 
great to see that efforts to help our neighbors don't end with the conclusion 
of the holiday season.

JUSTLY HONORED -- Attorney Pierce O'Donnell gets cited by the Los Angeles 
Friends of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Saturday with the Raoul 
Wallenberg "Save the Children" award. The dinner, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, 
features Art Buchwald as guest speaker, and a list of dinner co-chairs that 
includes Danny Arnold, Jane and Ron Olson, Barry Lawrence, Harvey Knell and 
Robert C. Davidson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER UPCOMING -- Save March 11 for the National Italian American Foundation 
"Salute to Italian Americans in Entertainment." Motion Picture Assn. President 
Jack Valenti will keynote. . . . Shirley MacLaine on Tuesday will be honored 
for her performance as "Madame Sousatzka" with a tea-and-reception and with the 
first career achievement award from the Los Angeles Film Teachers Assn. John 
Forsythe, the star of MacLaine's first film, "The Trouble With Harry," will be 
on hand at the Universal Cineplex Theatre for the party -- as will Olympia 
Dukakis, co-star of MacLaine's latest film, "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
MAKING A DIFFERENCE -- In her lifetime, Corita Kent brought a different view of 
the world and of peace. On March 8, those who embrace the message of peace that 
she artistically portrayed will be honored with the first Corita Kent Peace 
Awards at a dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Joan Palevsky, Mary Jane Hewitt 
and Dorothy Courtney are organizing the event, which will help to enlarge the 
fund established in Corita's name for peace programs at Immaculate Heart 
College Center. Honored with these first awards will be singer Miriam Makeba, 
professor of religion and peace studies Walter Capps, business leader and peace 
activist Fred Segal and Michelle Alexander, the 12-year-old inventor of the 
game "Give Peace a Chance." 
</P>
<P>
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY -- Frank Sinatra will be in the spotlight -- but this time as 
the honoree as Beverly Hills celebrates its 75th anniversary, Jan. 25 at the 
Beverly Hills Hotel. Jaclyn Rosenberg and Annabelle Heiferman are the evening's 
co-chairs. . . . Same night and just a few blocks away, the Concern Foundation 
for Cancer Research benefits from the first Robert J. Leib Memorial Celebrity 
Art &amp; Doodle Show at the Upstairs Gallery. More than 100 pieces of celeb 
art will be part of the silent auction. And, speaking of anniversaries, this is 
the 20th year that Concern has been raising money. Over the years, it has given 
out more than $11 million in grants for cancer research.

BIG WHEELS -- That, of course, would be mega-hotelier Barron Hilton and the 
still-aspiring movie-studio head Jerry Weintraub. But, wait -- they are only 
the hosts for the Wednesday party celebrating the "kick-off" of Wheels Across 
America. The Big Wheels promised at the Beverly Hilton are major sports figures 
-- and the reception will go to help raise money for the Miami Project to Cure 
Paralysis. The organization, which has raised more than $8 million, got under 
way when Marc Buoniconti, the son of former all-pro Dolphin linebacker Nick 
Buoniconti, was paralyzed by an injury in a college football game.

I have always voted Democratic . . . sometimes with enthusiasm and sometimes 
not. Had I known that Vice President George Bush would choose his team on the 
strength of their tennis prowess ("Tennis, Everyone?" by Paul Dean, Dec. 19), I 
might have made an exception in this last election. Who can fault men who like 
a game that is played on a court where service is a vital part of the game? The 
only problem is, it is also a game where love means nothing. Maybe I voted the 
right way after all! Time will tell.

A YIDDISH TERM EVOLVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "The American Jewish Experience" (Dec. 22), Elaine Woo referred to a common 
but mistaken explanation of the Yiddish term bobe mayse. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a bobe mayse is not merely an anecdote about the past but rather an old 
wives' tale, often of doubtful veracity. Moreover, while most Yiddish speakers 
believe that the expression derives from the Yiddish bobe (grandmother), it 
actually has a more literary antecedent: an early 16th-Century Yiddish romance 
called the "Bove-bukh" ("Bove-Book"), written in Italy. Its author, Elye 
Levita, borrowed from an earlier Italian source, which was in turn based on the 
escapades -- in English -- of one Bevis of Hampton. Via the Italian, Bevis 
became Bove. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Bove-bukh was no longer regular reading among Yiddish speakers, the 
term bove-mayse (Bove story) acquired its present folk etymology.

The Fox Network, which long has been talking about expanding its prime-time 
programming from two nights to three, has made it official and will add Monday 
to its lineup come fall. "Fox has come a long way in two years," Michael 
Fisher, chairman of the network's Board of Governors, told network affiliates 
here over the weekend. "We are undeniably a force to be reckoned with in the 
industry." The network now programs prime time on Saturday and Sunday nights. 
The new Monday lineup has a start date of Sept. 11 and will be chosen from 25 
pending projects. ALEENE MacMINN

The Walt Disney animators are going to work on an ambitious new daily 
syndicated program that will hit the air in the fall of 1990. "The Disney 
Afternoon" will be two hours of original animated programming that will 
introduce "Tale Spin," a $30-million animated series built around an outrageous 
band of daredevil pilots, and also include the current-running "Duck Tales" and 
"Gummi Bears," plus an upcoming series, "Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers." Richard 
Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, says the $400,000-per-episode cost 
will make "Tale Spin" the most expensive animated series ever on television, 
topping Disney's "Duck Tales," which carries a $25-million-a-season price tag 
and currently is said to be the costliest animated series on TV. The syndicated 
package will be distributed by Buena Vista Television and will likely cost $100 
million a season to produce. Frank says the success of Disney brand products 
worldwide will pay for the expensive, hand-illustrated animation the company 
prefers. "We had to find ways to pay for this first," he added. Two days before 
Disney's announcement, movie director/producer Steven Spielberg said he is 
getting into television animation with "Tiny Tunes," a syndicated series slated 
to debut in the fall 1990 through Warner Bros. Television. ALEENE MacMINN

After 26 years as a TV series star, actor-director-producer-writer Michael 
Landon says: "I don't think I want to be in a series again." Landon, 51, who 
starred as Little Joe Cartwright in "Bonanza" for 14 years (1959-73), as 
Charles Ingalls (Pa) in "Little House on the Prairie" for eight (1974-82) and 
as Earthbound angel Jonathan Smith for four years in NBC's recently-finished 
"Highway to Heaven," told The Times that he prefers to concentrate on producing 
TV projects rather than starring in them in the future. Meantime, he's enjoying 
"the first time off I've had in 30 years." ALEENE MacMINN

The Hard Rock Cafe in New Orleans is caught between a rock and a hard city 
commission that has turned down a request for a "walk of fame" on the sidewalks 
surrounding the French Quarter eatery. The restaurant wants to install a dozen 
brass plaques, emblazoned with stars, as tributes to musicians who have visited 
the Hard Rock. Similar plaques have been planted at Hard Rock Cafes in other 
cities. The Vieux Carre Commission, which guards the architectural integrity of 
the French Quarter, the oldest section of the Mississippi River port city, said 
that the quarter should not be home to memorials for the living and that 
sidewalks should not be used for advertising. The cafe will resubmit the 
proposal. ALEENE MacMINN

YOUNG SOPRANO LIVES UP TO HER REPUTATION IN 'MOZART PLUS' CONCERT

Every so often the word circulates that some new performer is a "must see." 
Recently, the Chinese soprano Sylvia Wen has been the subject of such rumors. 
She appeared Friday night at the Lyceum Theatre as one of the soloists in the 
International Orchestra of USIU's opening concert in its "Mozart Plus" series. 
</P>
<P>
Wen, who has recently finished two years of study at La Scala, proved to be a 
young singer of exceptional ability. For the Lyceum audience she sang five 
selections from Joseph Canteloube's accessible "Songs of the Auvergne" and 
"Song to the Moon," the frequently sung aria from Dvorak's rarely performed 
opera "Rusalka." While she projected a bright and unusually well-focused lyric 
soprano quality, it was the maturity of her interpretation that impressed this 
listener. 
</P>
<P>
The Canteloube pieces practically sell themselves, but Wen infused each song 
with a lively, engaging presence. She carried every phrase to a graceful 
conclusion, and her elegant, seamless vocal technique was a touch of luxury on 
a program that reeked of frugality. In the Dvorak aria, which she sang in the 
original Czech, Wen was positively radiant, projecting the aria's passionate 
longing with poignant vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Zoltan Rozsnyai, the International Orchestra's music director, chose to open 
the concert with Respighi's "The Birds." This was an unlikely choice, since the 
work's deft orchestration, which calls for exquisite solos and suave 
transitions, exposed every weakness in this unsophisticated orchestra. These 
birds didn't soar and coo -- they limped and warbled weakly. 
</P>
<P>
While the International Orchestra rehearses daily and claims professional 
caliber, it did not sound much better than the typical university orchestra 
that is lucky to rehearse one night a week. Nor did this group sound much 
better than it did a year ago. The orchestra was at its best in Zoltan Kodaly's 
brilliant "Dances of Galanta," exuding a kind of crude energy that seemed not 
entirely inappropriate to either the character of the piece or Rozsnyai's 
blustery, overblown direction. 
</P>
<P>
Had the soprano not stolen the show, its star would have been Giselle 
Lautenbach, soloist in Richard Strauss' Oboe Concerto. Lautenbach handled every 
musical challenge with aplomb, giving her sinuous solo a warm, mellifluous 
lyricism. This was a laudable feat, considering the uninspired level of the 
orchestral accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting a series or chamber orchestra concerts at the Lyceum, a convenient 
and intimate downtown venue, is a fine idea, even if the room's acoustics are a 
shade on the dry side. Why Rozsnyai chose to call this series "Mozart Plus" is 
a mystery, however, since, like this concert, half the programs on the series 
feature no Mozart at all. From the prospectus, it appears that Respighi will be 
played as frequently as Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a minor complaint. The main challenge is for the orchestra to play 
on a more competent, professional level. If they do that, Rozsnyai can call his 
series anything his inventive mind should decide.

Veteran Hollywood photographer Murray Garrett can name drop with the best of 
them: Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Joan Crawford, 
Betty Grable, Tyrone Power, Jane Russell, Lana Turner and Loretta Young. He 
photographed these and many other celebrities during a 27-year career 
(1946-73), and his portraits of familiar faces will go on display today 
(through Feb. 17) at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly 
Hills. His first assignment in 1942 (when he was 16) was to photograph Eleanor 
Roosevelt. "Things were different then and photographers weren't enemies," says 
Garrett. "I had the good fortune of becoming friendly with these people and 
they trusted me."

'MURPHY'S FAULT' HAS FAULTS

"Murphy's Fault" (citywide), the first film to open in 1989, is sure to rank 
among the year's worst. It's a contrived, pointless, numbskull comedy, the kind 
in which the spectacle of people constantly losing their tempers and destroying 
property passes for humor. Patrick Dollaghan stars as a hot-headed struggling 
writer attracted to an equally volatile policewoman (Anne Curry). 
</P>
<P>
After writer-director Robert J. Smawley has run out of ideas as to how to 
sustain their combustible relationship, he has Dollaghan take revenge on the 
local police chief for his indifference to the fact that Dollaghan's brand-new 
van has been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Dollaghan, Curry and Stack Pierce (as Dollaghan's best pal) are pros, but 
"Murphy's Fault" (rated PG-13, presumably for some four-letter words) is 
otherwise hopelessly amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
'MURPHY'S FAULT'

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA ARCHIVE PREMIERES JAPANESE FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA Film Archive will present "New Japanese Cinema," composed of four 
films, all of them in their local premieres. Opening the series on Thursday at 
7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater are Midori Kurisaki's 50-minute "Dark Hair" (1980) 
and Hiroaki Yoshida's "Twilight of the Cockroaches" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
In "Dark Hair," Kurisaki traces the significance of long, dark hair for the 
Japanese woman in a series of exquisitely staged scenes from classical drama. 
"Hair is life to a woman," mutters an old crone, whose recollections of stories 
of women with beautiful hair provide the frame for the film. Not surprisingly, 
most of these tales are tragic, dealing with traditional star-crossed lovers. 
In several vignettes, the woman is played by gifted Kabuki actor Senjaku 
Nakamura. Kurisaki will be present. 
</P>
<P>
"Twilight of the Cockroaches" combines live-action with animation using 
considerable wit and imagination. In a small cottage inhabited by an untidy 
man, cockroaches reign supreme, aware that they live in a veritable paradise 
while in "another country" -- i.e., an apartment in a building nearby -- they 
are constantly endangered by a woman bent on exterminating them. But what if 
this woman should become involved with the man across the way. . .? Yoshida has 
anthropomorphized his cockroaches into adorable Disney-like creatures; his film 
is saved from sentimentality largely by the amusing perspective on the 
"gigantic" adults. 
</P>
<P>
If both "Dark Hair" and "Twilight of the Cockroaches" seem, in different ways, 
a bit precious, Juzo Itami's "A Taxing Woman's Return" (1987), which screens 
Saturday at 7:30 p.m., and Yojiro Takita's "The Yen Family" (1988), which 
screens Sunday at 7:30 p.m., are both crackling, hilarious satires that 
represent the mainstream contemporary Japanese cinema at its most vigorous and 
critical. These are both major films of universal appeal and seem destined for 
regular theatrical runs. 
</P>
<P>
As the title indicates, "A Taxing Woman's Return" is a sequel to Itami's "A 
Taxing Woman," which starred his wife, Nobuko Miyamoto, as an implacable tax 
inspector, a no-nonsense woman with a severe Dutch bob and a sprinkling of 
freckles that she makes no attempt to hide with makeup. 
</P>
<P>
This sequel is actually more accessible than the original in that it is not 
spoofing the specific foibles of the inscrutable Japanese tax system, but 
rather is commenting with pitch-dark, fatalistic humor on widespread corruption 
at the highest levels of government, a topic as timely as current headlines. 
Once again, Itami displays unflagging energy and panache as Miyamoto and her 
colleagues go after the sleek head of a lucrative religious cult, played with 
suave aplomb by the veteran Rentaro Mikuni. 
</P>
<P>
As in his previous "Comic Magazine," a corrosive satire on the excesses of the 
media, Takita is a gratifyingly uncompromising satirist. In "The Yen Family," 
he zeroes in on a suburban household so money-grubbing that it runs a newspaper 
distributorship and a catering service, both exploiting the elderly, out of the 
kitchen (where the mother is also operating her erotic wake-up service while 
she prepares breakfast). As "The Yen Family" becomes progressively outrageous, 
however, it also develops considerable complexity, and its indictment of 
materialism -- Japanese-style -- is often ironic and paradoxical. Like "A 
Taxing Woman Returns," "The Yen Family" is a swift, satisfying treat.

"New Chinese Cinema" continues at the Nuart Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. only 
with Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Horse Thief" (1986), one of the most fiercely 
demanding and awesomely beautiful films you are ever likely to see. It takes us 
into Tibet in the '20s -- it might as well be antiquity -- and presents us with 
a young clansman, Norbu (Tseshang Rigzin, who brings to mind the Toshiro Mifune 
of "Rashomon"), so poor he steals horses from transients to support his wife 
and 5-year-old son, yet so pious he gives most of his profits to the temple. 
Tian follows Norbu's destiny with minimal dialogue and exposition, and with 
astounding images of natural beauty and of the elaborate, mysterious rituals of 
Tibetan Buddhism. As film historian Tony Rayns has observed, Tian invites us to 
meditate upon rather than to analyze what we're seeing, and Tian's images are 
indeed comparable to those of Tarkovsky, Paradjanov and Bresson.

RADIO CONTESTS-FOR-CASH: HOW FAR WILL THEY GO?

If you don't count the man who wanted to ride naked through downtown Denver in 
a wheelbarrow full of pudding or the youths who offered to blow up a rival 
radio station's transmission tower, the low point of KPBI-FM's "What Would You 
Do for $10,000?" contest probably was the time paramedics had to revive 
Contestant No. 3 from hypothermia suffered while towing a boatload of squealing 
piglets across a reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't look good to kill your listeners," Beth Harris, the station's 
promotions director, said. That is why KPBI turned down the man who offered to 
set his car afire and drive into a brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, just about anything else goes in the wacky, tacky and 
mercilessly competitive world of radio contests. 
</P>
<P>
Rock stations in at least six cities have given away plastic surgery. Listeners 
in Tennessee had a chance to win a funeral. One Texas station awarded an oil 
well. Weddings and divorces have become so commonplace as prizes that one 
station is considering offering a mail-order bride. 
</P>
<P>
"The stations are in this unwritten war across the country to come up with the 
wildest sort of contest and giveaway they can do," said Gary Reid, a 
telecommunications professor at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
"My copy of a Madonna album sounds just like your copy of a Madonna album," he 
said, "so competition, for the most part now, is between promotions departments 
instead of programming departments." 
</P>
<P>
Even more bizarre than the prizes offered are the indignities people are 
willing to endure to win them. A 25-year-old Utah man swallowed a snake when 
radio station KJQ-FM co-sponsored a contest called, "What's the Craziest Thing 
You Would Do for a Motorcycle and a Trip to California?" 
</P>
<P>
He didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
First place went to 21-year-old Jenise Merrill, who covered herself in creamed 
corn and rolled in cornflakes, after having distinguished herself in the 
semifinals by smearing liquid cow manure on herself. 
</P>
<P>
The contests have become "a combination of 'Friday the 13th' and 'The Gong 
Show,' " KJQ general manager Tom Greenleigh said. He added that he would have 
preferred to see the prize go to the hula-hooper wearing a nun's habit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken incredible heat on it," Greenleigh said of the contest, which he 
said stirred considerable controversy and bad publicity from false Humane 
Society reports that the snake had been swallowed alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushing Legal Limits 
</P>
<P>
Complaints go hand in hand with the zany competitions. Stations have run afoul 
of police, the National Organization for Women, the Federal Aviation 
Administration and even the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go out intending to offend anybody," said Doug Harris, director of 
creative services for Houston's KLOL, which once dangled a 40-foot-long bra 
from its billboard to promote a breast-augmentation giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out with the idea that you're going to interest people and cause some 
excitement, because the American public -- God bless 'em -- is jaded," he said. 
"They've seen everything but live sex and human sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
When KLOL offered $10,000 for the most outrageous display of its call letters, 
the winner planted a small plane bearing the logo into the side of a building 
he owned -- then called the FAA to report a plane crash. He was investigated 
but not charged, Harris said, and the station gave him the cash, even though it 
disapproved of the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve threatened to throw WYHY-FM's chief accounting officer in 
jail for defacing American currency after the Nashville station filled a 
swimming pool with 100,000 dollar bills, then let 10 honey-coated listeners 
roll in the dough and keep whatever cash stuck to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told to Launder Money 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, $92,000 didn't stick, and when the station tried to return the 
sweet leftovers, the Reserve demanded that the money be laundered -- or else, 
promotions director Scott Baker recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He said that about 20 staffers spent two days washing the $1 bills (in 
pillowcases), drying them ("gentle" cycle), ironing them (easy on the steam), 
and stacking them (face up) -- all while the money was under armed guard. 
</P>
<P>
WYHY also claims it was first to give away a breast augmentation. It enjoyed 
the storm of controversy enough to plot a new and even more questionable way to 
use its $250,000 contest budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking about giving away a mail-order bride -- or groom," operations 
manager Marc Chase said. "We'd let the winner go through the catalogue, pick 
one out; then we'd pay to bring them over and put them up in a hotel for a 
month while they get to know each other. . . . It is slavery, to a degree, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
For the last few years, the 2,000-member Assn. of Broadcast Promotion and 
Marketing Executives has included a "Most Outrageous Radio Contest" category in 
its Gold Medallion Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Station KGBX in Springfield, Mo., has won the award twice for its annual "Fish 
Fling," which tests how far listeners can hurl a frozen carp. 
</P>
<P>
"If the object is to get listeners and create excitement in the community, some 
people will say it doesn't matter how in the hell you do it," said Jay Curtis, 
member services director of the Los Angeles-based association. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles media consultant Harvey Mednick, a 28-year veteran of the radio 
industry, believes it does matter, and that things have gone too far already. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anything for Money? 
</P>
<P>
"There have been cases where people have filed their teeth to points -- 
literally disfigured themselves -- to curry favor with a radio station," 
Mednick said. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it totally tasteless," he said. "If a radio station challenges a 
listener to do something, then, realistically, they are responsible. Where does 
it go from here? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe where it stops is when, somewhere along the line, there is a genuine 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Station officials say they often take out special insurance to cover listener 
stunts, demand that competitors sign waivers, consult with lawyers and 
sometimes even doctors as precautionary measures. 
</P>
<P>
KOY-FM, Phoenix, awarded Fiesta Bowl tickets to a man who ate 30 jalapeno chili 
peppers in five minutes, and the morning show successfully dared a listener to 
walk into a convenience store, bark, ask for a can of dog food and then eat it. 
All for $95. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, John Geiger, 33, and Jeff Howard, 23, won Super Bowl tickets from 
KLOS-FM by grilling an NFL (leather) football on a hibachi, cutting it into 
bite-sized pieces and eating it at 7 in the morning before a crowd of hooting 
strangers in the Los Angeles station's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Football With Sauce 
</P>
<P>
"We got enough barbecue sauce on it so it didn't taste too bad," said Howard. 
"We had a good time doing it. We were going to eat the whole thing, but they 
stopped us about a third of the way through and said that's enough. They were 
afraid we might keel over." 
</P>
<P>
The winners admitted that the two girls who wrestled a pig in a wading pool 
filled with spaghetti -- complete with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese -- did 
have them worried. But, hey, so did the guy in a tuxedo and boxer shorts who 
belly-flopped 8 feet into a vat of orange gelatin topped with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no way to measure how much the contests improve ratings, 
stations report that, typically, 10% to 20% of their listeners enter them, and 
some consider them a vocation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are professional contest enterers who are required, because of illness, 
age or family responsibilities, to stay at home during the day," said Doug 
Harris. "It's not uncommon for a 65-year-old grandma to win a rock 'n' roll 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have speed-dialing on their phones and they keep three or four 
radios going in the home at the same time. They actually build their day around 
radio contests," he said, adding that this is why many stations limit the 
number of prizes a single listener can win within a 30-day period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Flawed Second Try 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Thompson was something of a pro. When KPBI asked what listeners would do 
for $10,000, the 40-year-old Denver security guard considered himself a 
shoo-in. After all, hadn't he already won $20,000 from another station for 
dropping a car through his mobile home? 
</P>
<P>
This time, Thompson decided to fill his house to the rafters with popcorn. 
Using industrial poppers, he spent the better part of a sleepless week last 
summer cooking up a 6,000-pound batch. 
</P>
<P>
When the deadline arrived Thompson's door had to be pried off, but alas, he had 
forgotten one little detail: Popcorn settles. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
It took four tries for KPBI to get a winner out of more than 1,000 contenders. 
The station rejected the man who said he'd cut off his own leg for the cash, 
and it noticed that an awful lot of proposed entries involved Jell-O and 
nudity. The grand finale proved to be a splash. Well, maybe more of a splat: 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shpakow dropped 105.9 watermelons 105.9 feet, from an old Montgomery Ward 
building through the open sunroof of his Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Run on Name Changes 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rival Denver station Q103-FM had challenged its listeners to legally 
change their names to "The New Q103-FM." When 49 of them took up the challenge, 
one irate judge barred Q cases from his courtroom because they were clogging 
the docket. Only the Q who produced the most documents bearing the new moniker 
collected the $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio steroids," is what Doug Harris calls the outlandish contests. "If you 
don't have a strong programming department and strong on-air personalities to 
fall back on, it's like shouting in the desert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He worries about the precedents that are being set. 
</P>
<P>
"With the new generation of pre-teens and teens growing up with home computers, 
24-hour TV and 186 channels to choose from," he said, "this is going to be a 
tough generation to dazzle."

Libya's ambassador to the United Nations on Sunday offered an apparently new 
proposal for solving the dispute over a suspected chemical weapons plant, 
saying his government is willing to allow continuous international inspection 
of the facility as long as Libya is not the only country that has to submit to 
such monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a decision from the U.N. to inspect such plants, not only in Libya 
but in other countries . . . we are ready to go ahead," Ambassador Ali Treiki 
said. "We are ready to talk with the United States . . . and we do hope that 
with the new Administration, the door will open to new cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the suggestion, made on ABC's "This Week With David 
Brinkley," could reflect a Libyan desire to solve the dispute diplomatically, 
but he said that Libya has still offered no suggestions that would satisfy U.S. 
concerns about the plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talking Through Hat? 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't shown that they're serious yet. (Treiki) may have been just 
talking through his hat," said the official, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Other U.S. and European diplomats have said there are other signs that Libyan 
leader Moammar Kadafi hopes to solve the problem through negotiations -- 
especially after U.S. Navy jets shot down two Libyan warplanes last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration has charged that the plant, 40 miles southwest of the 
Libyan capital of Tripoli, would be the Third World's largest chemical weapons 
factory if it were completed. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has insisted that the plant is designed to manufacture pharmaceuticals, 
but it has refused to allow diplomats and reporters to inspect the interior of 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Treiki's offer marked the first time that Libya has suggested publicly that it 
could accept continuous inspection of the plant's operation. Previously, the 
Tripoli government had offered only a one-time international inspection, an 
idea the United States rejected as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Libya's foreign secretary, Jaddallah Talhi, made no mention of the 
idea in a separate television interview, and he refused to rule out the 
possibility that Libya might use the plant to produce chemical weapons in the 
future -- just as the Reagan Administration has charged. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not the intention, we have no plan for the time being," Talhi said on 
CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
But, when asked about the future, Talhi replied, "You will never know." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that hints from Administration officials that the United States 
might mount a military strike against the plant if it goes into operation have 
rattled Libya's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits Leaders Are Worried 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, our experience is a very bitter one, and we are really 
worried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said they intend to seek a diplomatic solution to 
the dispute before resorting to military action, beginning with a drive to 
persuade other countries to block Libya's access to the equipment, chemicals 
and technical help it needs to operate the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the majority and minority parties in the Senate, Sens. George 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and Bob Dole (R-Kan.), urged the Administration to continue on 
that cautious path. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in Best Interests 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any preemptive strike at this time would be in the best interest 
of this Administration or the Bush Administration," Dole said on NBC's "Meet 
the Press." 
</P>
<P>
"Kadafi has indicated that he wants to talk," the GOP leader said. "Let's try 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
But both Dole and Mitchell added that President-elect Bush should keep open the 
possibility of a military strike against the plant.

A pregnant pathologist was found beaten to death and possibly raped in her 
laboratory office at historic Bellevue Hospital in New York, and officials 
declared the investigation the city's No. 1 police priority. Police 
Commissioner Benjamin Ward assigned a team of 50 detectives to the case, and 
Mayor Edward I. Koch announced a $30,000 reward for the murderer. "We don't 
want doctors looking over their shoulders in fear," Koch said at a hospital 
news conference. Security guards, alerted by the woman's husband, Eric Johnson, 
found the body of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 34, beaten to death in a secluded office 
where she was preparing a slide presentation for a lecture today, police said.

Israel's powerful Histadrut labor federation threatened to call strikes if the 
government denies workers realistic cost-of-living pay increases to compensate 
for a 12% devaluation of the shekel and subsidy cuts. A federation spokesman 
said that unless the government reimposes price controls and gives assurances 
that it will not slash education and health budgets, the labor group will 
withhold support for a plan by Finance Minister Shimon Peres that ends 
automatic cost-of-living increases. Peres has said he will press union 
officials to support lower real wages.

Three members of a U.S.-based dissident Chinese group left Shanghai after 
police accused them of breaking the law, the official New China News Agency 
said. It said the three -- Huang Wencheng, a Chinese-American; Huang Han, a 
Chinese-Canadian, and Tang Guangzhong, a Chinese student studying in the United 
States -- are heading for other countries but did not specify if they have left 
China yet. The news agency said the three acknowledged belonging to the New 
York-based Chinese Alliance for Democracy, a group -- set up by a former 
Chinese citizen in 1983 -- that advocates a democratic revolution in China. 
Chinese officials have declared it an illegal, reactionary organization.

A Brazilian cattle rancher suspected by authorities of ordering the killing of 
a prominent Amazon ecologist surrendered to police because "he was tired of 
living on the run," authorities said. Darly Alves da Silva, who police believe 
masterminded the Dec. 22 shooting death of ecologist Francisco Mendes, gave up 
in the jungle town of Xapuri near the Bolivian border. Mendes, 44, led a local 
rubber tappers union in Xapuri whose members often tried to block ranchers' 
efforts to clear rain forest. Da Silva is the father of Darcy Pereira da Silva, 
21, who has confessed to the killing. Two of his brothers are in custody in the 
case.

Armenia's controversial nuclear power plant, which survived last month's 
earthquake, will be closed by spring, Soviet television said, quoting the 
republic's Communist Party chief. Suren G. Arutyunyan announced the closure in 
a speech to a Communist Party meeting in Yerevan, the Armenian capital. Soviet 
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said after the earthquake that the plant at 
Medzamor, about 15 miles from Yerevan, would be shut within two years due to 
growing public fears. The tremor did not damage the nuclear plant, but it 
revived a longstanding controversy about the station. Arutyunyan said the 
station's first reactor will be shut down Feb. 25 and the second on March 18.

The Soviet Union will upgrade the status of the Israeli consular mission in 
Moscow and view it as an "address for political activities," Israeli Foreign 
Minister Moshe Arens said. He added in an interview with Israel Radio that he 
was informed of the decision by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
during a meeting in Paris, where both are attending a conference on chemical 
weapons. He said the Israeli consular mission will be allowed to move from the 
Dutch Embassy in Moscow to the Israeli Embassy, which has been unused since the 
Kremlin broke diplomatic relations in 1967.

Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson changed his travel plans after a bomb 
threat against his country's national airline, Swedish Radio said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) security chief Urban Paulin said Sweden's 
secret police had received a note threatening an attack on an unspecified plane 
leaving Paris, where Andersson is attending an international conference on 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Andersson hosted a meeting last month between Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. Jews and later helped to draft a document in 
which Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist.

GUARD CALLED, CLEANUP BEGINS AFTER TORNADOES STRIKE 3 STATES

National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as cleanup began 
Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that injured more than 50 people and 
damaged or destroyed scores of homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he planned to declare 
the town a state disaster area today. He also sent about 100 National Guardsmen 
to prevent looting and help clean up the town, where more than a third of the 
homes and commercial buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm. 
</P>
<P>
In southwestern Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured 
three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30 farm 
buildings in the St. Thomas area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damage in Central Indiana 
</P>
<P>
Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged several houses 
and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area, causing an estimated $500,000 
damage, Sheriff's Deputy Jim Baylis said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in outlying areas of 
Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12 million in damage to 
businesses and homes, Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard troops to 
help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David Adkinson, operations 
manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
In Allendale, the tornado cut through a 10-block area that makes up about half 
the town of 600. 
</P>
<P>
"The east half of the town's gone," said Marvin Jones, an ambulance driver. 
"Most of the streets are blocked by wires and trees and debris . . . . 
Belongings are scattered everywhere."

<P>
A blizzard that made travel "virtually impossible" in North Dakota and 
Minnesota blew into Michigan Sunday, and temperatures plummeted to produce a 
wind-chill factor of 65 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
A record 24 inches of snow fell at Fargo, N. D., and Crookston, Minn., reported 
22 inches. 
</P>
<P>
A winter storm warning remained posted for parts of Upper Michigan through 
Sunday evening, where a foot of snow fell at Wakefield, Nestoria and Ontonogon. 
At Calumet, blizzard conditions were reported, and visibility was reduced to 
150 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The wind-whipped snow blinded motorists and cut visibility to nearly zero over 
eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is virtually impossible to travel over the blizzard areas," meteorologist 
Brian Smith warned Sunday.

The chief rabbi of Tiberias has revoked the kosher food license of a hotel for 
allowing a naked couple to have sex in a helicopter hovering above its pool 
during a New Year's party, the Jerusalem Post said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the 20-minute live aerial sex act, the main attraction of 
the sold-out party at the Tiberias Club Hotel, was watched by guests from their 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Rabbi David Peretz said the hotel had sinned and did not deserve a 
license to serve kosher food. 
</P>
<P>
"The directors of the hotel are completely nuts," Tiberias Mayor Yigal Bibi was 
quoted by the newspaper as saying.

<P>
In the biggest retrenchment in U.S. Catholic history, a total of 30 city 
churches will close and 25 others have been given one year to improve their 
status. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen churches holding Masses on Saturday learned early that they would 
close, and the total of 30 churches emerged as announcements were made at 
Masses on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Edmund Szoka's decision to close the churches slightly softened a task 
force recommendation in September that 43 churches be closed and a handful of 
others merged into parishes with more members and greater resources. 
</P>
<P>
The decision concludes more than five years of study begun to shore up parishes 
in neighborhoods that lost large numbers of Catholics to the suburbs over the 
last 20 years and to deal with the shortage of priests and cost of maintaining 
under-used buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The closings, most of which are scheduled to take place by July, and mergers 
leave 82 parishes in the city, including the 25 whose survivability is in 
question, Szoka said.

BITTER IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT IN PARTY SEEN CLOSING; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVES QUIET ON BUSH'S SELECTION OF KISSINGER ALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, when then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger appeared at 
the Republican National Convention, many of Ronald Reagan's delegates stood up 
and booed at the man they considered an unwelcome symbol of foreign policy 
moderation. And eight years ago, when Reagan first entered the White House, 
Kissinger and many of his former aides were pointedly passed over when foreign 
policy appointments were made. 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed. Two of the most important foreign policy jobs in the 
new Bush Administration have gone to former "Kissinger men," with more 
reportedly to come. There has been hardly a peep of protest from the GOP's 
right wing. And Kissinger himself, who sometimes criticized Reagan's leadership 
in a tone approaching contempt, has nothing but compliments for the abilities 
of George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very enthusiastic about the new Administration," the former secretary of 
state said in a recent telephone interview. "Very, very enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked for Kissinger 
</P>
<P>
Bush's choice for national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and deputy 
secretary of state, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, are not only former Kissinger 
aides; for the last five years they also have both been officers of Kissinger 
Associates, Kissinger's private consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Several other Kissinger acolytes are also in line for top jobs under Secretary 
of State-designate James A. Baker III, according to Reagan Administration 
officials and Bush transition aides: William G. Hyland, now editor of Foreign 
Affairs magazine, John D. Negroponte, a National Security Council aide, and 
Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, a mere mention of their names would have prompted dire warnings 
from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other conservative stalwarts that Reagan's 
foreign policy legacy was in danger of being sabotaged. But a call last week to 
Helms' office produced only a private word of disparagement from an aide about 
"the Kissinger-Rockefeller types," a reference to Kissinger's original 
political patron, the late Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the return of the Kissinger men -- and the broad applause their 
reappointments have drawn -- suggest that the bitter ideological differences 
which often divided not only the Republican Party but also the Reagan Cabinet 
as well are largely over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrows Dukakis Line 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing, ironically, is a turn to competence rather than ideology," 
said another former Kissinger aide, Helmut Sonnenfeldt (borrowing a line from 
Bush's opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, in the presidential 
campaign). 
</P>
<P>
"The appointments, for the most part, have gone to the center of the spectrum," 
he said. "What it says is that Bush is going to be that kind of President, and 
Baker is going to be that kind of secretary of state. . . . You'll be getting 
professional people, pragmatic people." 
</P>
<P>
"A triumph of competence over ideology," echoed Kenneth L. Adelman, Reagan's 
former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. "It's a more 
standard Republican lot than the Reagan Administration started with, more the 
country club Republican set . . . a vanilla crowd." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find in this group what the drive will be, what the message will 
be," Adelman added. "The Reagan Administration had SDI (the Strategic Defense 
Initiative), the Reagan Doctrine (of aid to anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua 
and elsewhere), the mission of revitalizing American strength. What are these 
guys going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
But even Adelman agrees that the time is ripe for a more centrist approach. 
"This is a very different time from 1980," he said. "Then the strategic 
momentum was with the Soviet Union, and the United States had to find a way to 
turn that around. Now everything's coming up roses, and what we have to do is 
stay on a steady path." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Views 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Bush has not deserted the conservative tenets of Reagan's foreign 
policy. The President-elect still supports SDI, aid for the Contras and the use 
of U.S. military power in the Persian Gulf and other trouble spots. And on one 
central issue, the U.S. attitude toward the Soviet Union, Bush has been 
markedly more skeptical than Reagan, who embraced the idea of a new 
understanding with Moscow as a major part of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The center of gravity has shifted a bit, but not that much," argued a Bush 
aide. "Ronald Reagan's appointments went way up into the 90 percents on a 
conservative scale. George Bush's appointments have maybe scaled back from 90 
to 85. They're still conservatives." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's style has been noticeably different from Reagan's already, even 
before his inauguration. His rhetoric has been less fiery; "He has a less 
emotional approach to the issues," noted Sonnenfeldt. And his attitude toward 
Congress has been more conciliatory, both Democrats and Republicans say. 
</P>
<P>
And the most ideological conservatives, the ones who struggled to keep the 
Reagan Administration's anti-Soviet foreign policy "pure," are noticeably 
absent from the lists of rumored appointees. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is that the Reaganites just aren't available any more. They've done 
their bit in government, and now they're out doing other things," the Bush aide 
said. "Part of it is ideological, sure. . . . But there's stylistic stuff as 
well as ideology. George Bush likes people who solve problems. He doesn't like 
people who are ideologically or personally aggressive, and the two traits often 
seem to go together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Internal Debates 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration still faces some internal foreign policy debates. On 
Nicaragua, for example, the President-elect has spoken strongly in favor of 
renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras in an attempt to push the leftist 
regime toward internal democracy. But some members of Congress have said that 
Baker seems skeptical about how effective the battered Contras can be; and 
associates say Eagleburger, like Kissinger, has long believed that the center 
of U.S. concern in Central America should be the threat of growing Soviet 
influence in the region rather than the quest for parliamentary democracy. 
</P>
<P>
As for Kissinger, Bush aides say he may be asked to head special commissions on 
foreign policy problems, as he did for Reagan on Central America in 1983-1984. 
Asked about a possible role for him as a special negotiator in the Middle East 
or elsewhere, though, they sound uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"People would spend most of their time worrying about whether Henry was walking 
away with the store," said one. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Kissinger himself says he is quite delighted to see his friends 
walk away with the Administration's best jobs, and quite happy to remain in 
private life with the best contacts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably shouldn't say this," he mused. "But there probably isn't a job 
there that I really want."

COLLEGE STUDENTS FEEL MORE STRESS, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
College students are feeling increasing stress and anxiety about getting into 
prestigious graduate schools and landing big-money jobs, according to a 
national survey of freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the stress, the survey suggested, may be the increasing 
difficulty of financing a college education. As federal financial aid continues 
to drop, more of the burden of paying for college is falling on the students 
and their families, according to the annual study sponsored by the American 
Council on Education and UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The study, released today, found that 10.5% of freshmen last fall reported 
feeling depressed frequently and that 21.5% feel overwhelmed by all they have 
to do. Both percentages were the highest ever recorded in the 23 years that the 
survey has been conducted and several points higher than just the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"Extreme competition breeds stress," explained the survey's director, Alexander 
W. Astin, a professor of higher education at UCLA's Graduate School of 
Education. Some students believe that they have to be superstars in school and 
in their careers if they are even going to match their parents' standard of 
living, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that a record percentage of freshmen -- 72.6% -- indicated 
that making more money was a "very important" factor in their decision to 
attend college; that has grown steadily since the 49.9% recorded in 1971. 
Meanwhile, 60.1% said they are enrolled in college "to gain a general 
education." That is a low point in a decline from 70.9% in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth C. Green, the survey's associate director, said such trends are linked 
to students' uncertainties about the future, bred during the inflation and the 
recessions that occurred in their childhoods. "It's not just greed," he 
explained. "It's an understanding that in order to get the middle-class basket 
of goodies, like a house, you may now have to be well off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Careful Planners 
</P>
<P>
The current college generation can be characterized as "children of the 
upheaval," Green said, adding: "I think they are not unlike their grandparents 
who lived through the Great Depression." The experience has caused young people 
to become early and careful planners of their lives, in sharp contrast to many 
students of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
A record high percentage of freshmen in 1988 said they wanted to get doctoral 
degrees -- 11.7%, up from 10.4% in 1987, 7.9% in 1980 and 9.7% in 1970, 
according to the survey. Interest in law degrees also was at its highest, 5.0%, 
compared to 4.2% in 1987 and 3.5% in 1970. And 5.7% of freshmen said they want 
medical, dental or veterinary careers, up from 5.3% the year before, although 
still below the peak of 7.5% in 1974 when those careers were seen as less 
problem-laden. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise in degree aspirations may suggest that a growing proportion of 
students feel that the bachelor's degree will not be an adequate credential in 
the job market of the next decade and the next century," said the study, which 
is based on responses of 222,296 students at 402 of the nation's two- and 
four-year colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Careers 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of freshmen interested in business careers dipped slightly, to 
23.6% from 24.6% the previous year, probably as a result of the negative 
publicity about last year's stock market crash and the scandals on Wall Street. 
However, the 1988 level was still far above the 19.7% recorded in 1980 and the 
10.5% in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about steady and very good income are being reinforced by the high 
costs of college and a drop in government aid, the study suggested. During the 
Reagan Administration, eligibility for aid was tightened and scholarship 
funding declined after inflation adjustments, Astin said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1988, the percentage of freshmen who reported receiving Pell 
Grants, the federal government's primary scholarship program for low- and 
middle-income students, dropped from 31.5% in 1980 to 15.6%, according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, participation in federally supported work-study programs dropped 
steadily from 14.5% in 1980 to 6.6% in 1988. Even the percentage of freshmen 
receiving federally guaranteed loans -- which had grown steadily between 1980 
and 1986, from 20.9% to 25.4% -- has declined sharply in the last two years. In 
the fall of 1988, 20.1% of students were recipients of such loans, down from 
22.2% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payment Burden 
</P>
<P>
"The burden of paying for college has shifted increasingly to students, their 
families and the nation's colleges and universities," Astin said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the fears about careers and money, the survey found some evidence 
that the celebrated materialism of 1980s college students may be peaking. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in nursing rose a bit, from 4.0% to 4.4% of freshmen, but was still 
well below the 8.4% high in 1983. Teaching, never regarded as a path to riches, 
is the goal of 8.8%, steadily up from the low of 4.7% in 1983 yet very much 
less than the 23.5% of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed continued growth in the proportion of students who identify 
their political views as conservative or far right: 21.8%, up from 19.6% in 
1987 and the low of 14.5% in 1973. Almost unchanged from the previous year was 
the 24.3% who said they were liberal or far left, up from 21.8% in 1980 but 
well below the peak of 38.1% recorded in 1971. Declining somewhat in recent 
years are the middle-of-the-road students, who were 53.9% of freshmen last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those self-descriptions, a strong majority of freshmen support 
traditional liberal stands on specific issues such as abortion and the role of 
government in curbing pollution. The big exceptions involve crime and drugs. 
Opposition to the death penalty is at an all-time low, 23.0%, down from 32.6% 
in 1978.

The gnarled but picturesque Torrey Pine tree, the rarest species of pine in the 
United States and a revered part of the coastal landscape just north of La 
Jolla, have been jealously guarded from human harm here like a jewel in a 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Torrey Pines that cling to a 4-mile stretch of sandstone bluffs 
face a new threat. Weakened by two years of drought and several days of hellish 
heat in late summer, they have been hit by a bark beetle infestation which, if 
unchecked, could seriously deplete the Torrey Pines State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The pest, called the "confused five-spined beetle" because of the aimless path 
it bores under the bark of a tree, has already killed a dozen Torrey Pines at 
the 1,750-acre park and threatens to lay low more than 100 others. State 
officials worry that the problem could spread even further into the park's 
Torrey Pines population, estimated at 7,000 trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Concern 
</P>
<P>
"We're deeply concerned and a bit alarmed at the extent of the infestation," 
said Bob Wohl, supervising ranger at the reserve. "It's located in the heart of 
the park, the areas with the highest visibility and the most prominence." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the pines along the San Diego County coast, the trees exist in only 
one other place in the world -- on Santa Rosa Island, one of the chain of 
Channel Islands southwest of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials are hopeful that rain will continue through the winter, 
bolstering the health of the pines and increasing the production of sap that 
typically wards off the pests. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the rain we've had since Thanksgiving Day and the tremendous drop in 
temperature will knock the beetles off," Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Counterattack 
</P>
<P>
If the pests are still prevalent by spring, however, authorities probably will 
begin a counterattack, even though park policy encourages a laissez faire 
management approach to help maintain the reserve's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tippets, a state park ecologist, said officials would probably begin by 
thinning out unhealthy trees. Bark on infested pines probably would be stripped 
to create an inhospitable environment for the beetles. If necessary, some of 
the affected pines might be cut up and hauled out of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that some weakened and fallen trees have served as 
incubators for the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Insecticides would be considered only as a last resort. Tippets said chemicals 
typically prove only partly successful and could potentially kill insects that 
may prey on pests like the beetle. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle, Ips paraconfusus, hardly looks like a feared invader. Less than a 
quarter-inch long, the insect has a dark brown body with tiny rounded antenna. 
The slow-moving, winged insect is capable of wandering among several trees 
during its lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects of Insects 
</P>
<P>
It devours the cambium layer, the thin coat between the bark and inner hardwood 
that serves as the circulatory system for the tree, processing photosynthetic 
products as well as nutrients tapped from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A male finds a susceptible tree -- typically one weakened by drought or aging 
-- and sends out a sex attractant that lures female beetles. Together, they 
hollow out a larval chamber in the tree where the female lays eggs. The hatched 
larva do most of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of needles that characterize the Torrey Pine begin to drop. If the 
larva circumnavigate the trunk, severing the cambium layer connecting roots and 
branches, the pine eventually will die. 
</P>
<P>
On a tour of the grove, Wohl pointed to a graying tree. Reaching up, he grabbed 
a small branch and with an easy twist pulled off a ring of bark, ready proof 
that the tree had been infested. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say what we're talking about here is a doomed tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Noted 
</P>
<P>
Wohl said rangers first noticed problems in April, when the needles on several 
trees began to brown and drop off. The problems persisted through the summer 
and Wohl said several days of 100-degree temperatures produced a "blast furnace 
effect on the trees." 
</P>
<P>
By Labor Day, experts had isolated the beetles as the problem. In mid-December, 
a state forest pathologist conducted tests. He agreed that the drought had 
weakened the trees enough to allow the beetle infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the battle between a human immunological system and foreign bodies, 
Torrey Pines fight a continuous war with the beetle and other pests. A healthy 
flow of sap serves to repel the invading hordes, pushing their eggs out or 
encasing an attacker in a coat of resin. 
</P>
<P>
"The bark beetles are always here, but the trees can normally repel them," Wohl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has spread to several of the most prominent spots in the park that 
feature some of the oldest and most beautiful pines, which can live about 300 
years. Beetles also have spread to several trees surrounding the park 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given a New Name 
</P>
<P>
Once known as the Soledad Pine, the trees were renamed in 1850 by Dr. C.C. 
Parry, a botanist for the U.S. Mexican Boundary Survey. Parry chose the 
botanical name, Pinus torreyana or Torrey Pine, in honor of his former botany 
professor, Dr. John Torrey. 
</P>
<P>
In 1883, Parry returned to the site and began urging that the land be acquired 
to preserve the species from what he feared would be certain extinction at the 
hands of man. The City of San Diego designated 369 acres as a public park in 
1899. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Browning Scripps acquired adjacent groves in the years that followed, and 
those lands were added to the park in 1924, when it was enlarged to nearly 
1,000 acres. In 1979, a 154-acre extension area was formed on the sloping 
hillside to the north of Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous infestations. Most recently, bark beetles killed 18 
trees in 1984 and 1985. Eventually, rains helped bolster the surviving trees, 
and they repelled the beetles. 
</P>
<P>
Some authorities suggest that the Torrey Pines State Reserve's trees have been 
weakened not only by the recent drought, but by increased competition for water 
among the proliferating pines.

<P>
If San Diego officials ask the Legislature to block the proposed merger of 
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, they will butt 
heads with two of the Capitol's most extensive corporate lobbying operations. 
</P>
<P>
Edison and SDG&amp;E have spent a combined $650,918 in the past year to elect 
and influence members of the Legislature, Gov. Goerge Deukmejian, and his 
appointees to the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies contribute regularly to political campaigns. They wine and 
dine state lawmakers in Sacramento, across the country, and even around the 
world. And they give personal gifts, from sports tickets to ski trips, to 
legislators of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators say these payments have no impact on their deliberations. But no 
one denies that the utility lobbyists enjoy personal relationships with 
lawmakers and easy access to their staffs -- an edge that might be decisive be 
when it comes to influencing a closely fought legislative battle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Well-Financed' 
</P>
<P>
"These folks are very well-financed, very astute," said Ben Clay, lobbyist for 
the San Diego County Water Authority. "They've got legions of people available 
to work on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The Water Authority, an appointed body that acts as a wholesaler for the water 
San Diego imports from Northern California and the Colorado River, has proposed 
legislation enabling it to acquire SDG&amp;E, which would block the planned 
merger of the two investor-owned utilities. If successful, the acquisition 
would be the the largest public takeover of a utility in the nation's history, 
according to the American Public Power Assn. 
</P>
<P>
To help Clay lobby for the bill, the authority, which has spent $43,206 on 
lobbying since January, 1988, has hired veteran Sacramento advocate Phillip 
Schott, whose other clients include the Motion Picture and Television Producers 
and the California Assn. of Port Authorities. Still, the pair will face a 
formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison, which is expected to fight the Water Authority 
proposal, employs five in-house lobbyists. The company also hires a private 
lobbying firm -- Nossaman, Guthner, Knox &amp; Elliot -- for assistance. 
SDG&amp;E has four in-house lobbyists, two for the Legislature and two for the 
Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1988, Edison reported spending just short of 
$200,000 on lobbying. About half of that went in salary and expenses for the 
company's in-house lobbyists. The rest was paid to lobbying firms and went for 
gifts, meals and beverages for lawmakers. Edison also contributed $123,327 to 
lawmakers' campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E spent $254,823 on lobbying during the same period. The utility spent 
$73,889 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Cocktail Lounge to Golf Course 
</P>
<P>
The state's Political Reform Act prevents registered lobbyists from lavishing 
gifts upon lawmakers -- no more than $10 a month per lawmaker is permitted. But 
the utility lobbyists nonetheless have regular contact with legislators in 
social settings -- from the cocktail lounge to the golf course -- and the 
companies themselves are not subject to the $10 monthly limit. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples of the companies' contacts with legislators and their staffs: 
</P>
<P>
* On June 20, Edison bought dinner at Biba's, a fashionable Sacramento 
restaurant, for more than half of the 40-member state Senate. Seven of the 
senators brought their wives along for the dinner, which cost $161 a person. 
Each guest also received a $21 flashlight as a gift from Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine-member Senate committee that oversees the utility industry, only 
two members did not attend the dinner. The guest list also included 
three-fifths of the important Rules Committee, which decides procedural 
questions that can mean the life or death of legislation, and seven of the nine 
members of the Appropriations Committee. Eight of the 11 members of the 
Judiciary Committee were also present. 
</P>
<P>
* In the first three months of 1988, Edison gave Sacramento Kings basketball 
tickets to 16 legislators and several of their aides. Among those accepting 
tickets were Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the 
Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, and Assemblyman Patrick Nolan 
(R-Glendale), who was then the Republican leader in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
* One Edison lobbyist, Tommy Ross, frequently buys meals and drinks for 
legislative staff members at Brannon's, a bar and restaurant near the Capitol. 
For one recent meal, Ross hosted a consultant for the Assembly Utilities and 
Commerce Committee, a deputy in the office of the Legislative Counsel, two 
assistants to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), an aide to 
now-deceased Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-Inglewood), a staffer from the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, and the legislative coordinator for the state Office of 
Administrative Law. 
</P>
<P>
* Another Edison lobbyist, Robert Foster, plays golf regularly with legislators 
and their aides at a Sacramento County country club -- at least 26 times in the 
last 20 months. Since March, 1987, Foster has played golf 11 times with 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista), Peace's top aide, David Takashima, or 
both. Once, Foster even picked up the tab for Takashima's father. 
</P>
<P>
* SDG&amp;E lobbyists and company officials seem to prowl the bars of downtown 
Sacramento, looking for legislators and aides with whom they can share drinks 
and conversation. From July 1 through Sept. 26, they reported picking up tabs 
for 30 legislators and 27 aides on 33 separate occasions. The Legislature was 
in session for about 20 days during that period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay Travel Expenses 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, officials from both utilities are often on the scene when 
legislators and their spouses travel around the country or the world. They have 
bought meals or drinks for California legislators in Washington, D.C.; 
Nashville, Tenn.; Indianapolis, Ind., and Auckland, New Zealand, among other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
* SDG&amp;E bought tickets to the National Football League Super Bowl in San 
Diego for Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and her husband; Sen. Wadie P. 
Deddeh (D-Chula Vista) and his wife; and then-Sen. Jim Ellis (D-San Diego) and 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
* The two utilities helped share the cost of an outing known as the 
"Legislative Winter Carnival," in January, 1988. The two-day event features 
downhill ski races between lawmakers and their staffers from California and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Among the overnight attendees at the Strawberry Lodge in Kyburz, near the 
Sierra Ski Ranch, were Assemblyman Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) and his four 
children, and Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) and two of her 
children. Seven other Assembly members also attended. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers downplay the effect of such gratuities. In July, 1987, SDG&amp;E 
treated then-Assemblyman Larry Stirling, his staff and their families to a 
Padres baseball game, a package worth $634.13 including tickets, food and 
drinks. But Stirling, a San Diego Republican who is now a senator, is leading 
the campaign to scuttle the merger, much to SDG&amp;E's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Mojonnier said her receipt of contributions and gifts from the 
utilities will not affect her judgment. She said she hasn't decided whether to 
support or oppose the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"My door is open to anyone who wants to talk about the issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Energy and 
Public Utilities Committee, said he often socializes with Edison Chairman 
Howard Allen, and has accompanied Allen on events ranging from lunch to a tour 
of North Sea oil operations. But Rosenthal said that won't stop him from 
opposing the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger if he thinks it will hurt customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're doing things that are good for the ratepayers and good for air 
quality, then I'm supportive," he said. "But I'm not going to support something 
which only benefits the stockholders or is a sweetheart deal with certain 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Guarantee of Success 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists, likewise, say their constant contact with lawmakers does not 
guarantee success, only opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a message to tell," Cassie of SDG&amp;E said. "I don't think we've 
done anything any different from anybody else. All we get from what we do is an 
opportunity to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
Foster of Edison said his frequent contacts are necessary so that legislators 
are familiar with him when he needs to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They know who I am," he said. "That's my job. To make sure they know who I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Peace, whom Foster helped teach to play golf, noted that it is 
difficult to measure the "insidious" effect of legislators socializing with 
people who are paid to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California Edison in my opinion is as powerful as any special 
interest in the state," Peace said. "There's nobody more powerful." 
</P>
<P>
But Peace said he can oppose Foster and be opposed by him without hurting their 
personal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said that the utilities are among the more influential lobbies 
in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in there on a constant basis," he said. "They're informed, they keep 
their legislators informed, and they relate to their constituencies. The 
utilities always have a lot of clout."

FREEWAY PHONE SYSTEM IS FINALLY STARTING TO CLICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 3 1/2 years of frustrating delays, stalled starts and legal 
threats, an emergency telephone system designed to aid stranded or endangered 
motorists is nearing completion on freeways throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of the roadside telephones by Anaheim-based Cellular 
Communications Corp. began last summer, and 750 of the call boxes in the 
1,032-phone system are already operational. The remaining phones, most of them 
to be installed on California 78 in North County and Interstate 8 in East 
County, are expected to be in place by next month, according to officials of 
the San Diego Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies (SAFE). 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I doubted we'd ever see this day," said county 
Supervisor Leon Williams, SAFE's chairman. "It's been a long road and there 
have been problems along the way. But that's behind us now, and I think we're 
about to see our freeways become safer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Are Out of Gas 
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by the California Highway Patrol show that about 1,100 calls a 
week -- a number expected to grow when the system is completed -- are being 
logged on the boxes, with most of the calls coming from drivers of disabled 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 reason for a call: The vehicle is out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
The impending completion of the $5.3-million system comes after a series of 
legal and procedural problems that plagued the project since its inception in 
early 1985, when it arose out of the outrage over one woman being killed and 
another raped at gunpoint after their cars broke down on freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, SAFE awarded a contract to Comarco Inc. -- a subcontractor to Cellular 
-- calling for the installation of the call boxes at half-mile (1-mile in some 
rural areas) intervals along the county's 300-mile freeway system to make it 
easier for motorists to telephone for help in the event of automobile problems 
or other emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
That contract was challenged in court, however, by Cubic Corp., a San 
Diego-based firm that had bid about $500,000 less than Comarco. Ruling that 
SAFE's action violated competitive-bidding procedures, a Superior Court judge 
nullified the contract with Comarco and ordered the agency to award the project 
to the "lowest responsible bidder." 
</P>
<P>
In appealing that decision, SAFE officials argued that the state legislation 
creating the agency specifically exempted it from competitive-bidding 
guidelines, adding that Comarco was selected because it was viewed as having 
more experience with the phone system envisioned for the San Diego project. 
Last February, the 4th District Court of Appeal sided with SAFE. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, SAFE planned to reapprove the Comarco contract, but those 
plans were dashed at the eleventh hour when the company revealed that it was 
involved in a since-resolved patent dispute. With its members visibly 
exasperated -- Williams so much so that he suggested scuttling the troubled 
project -- SAFE then voted to solicit new bids, a process that culminated in a 
new contract being awarded to Cellular last 
</P>
<P>
June. 
</P>
<P>
Cellular's revised $5,271,820 bid, which covers both the cost of installing the 
call boxes and maintaining them over the next 10 years, was $122,000 less than 
that of Comarco, the next-lowest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The yellow call boxes, installed along the outside lanes of all local freeways, 
contain a solar-powered cellular-phone unit with a receiver to put the caller 
in direct contact with the Highway Patrol. People using the phones need not 
dial; they simply push a button that shows CHP dispatchers where the caller is 
and lets them talk to the dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
The phones, to be funded through a special $1 fee on annual vehicle 
registrations for San Diego County cars, initially will be spaced about half a 
mile apart on most freeways in urbanized areas, with the distance expanding to 
about 1 mile along more remote sections of I-8 east of Alpine, according to 
Ralph Thielicke, SAFE's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Granville Bowman, San Diego County's director of public works and administrator 
of the SAFE program, said that when more funds are available, the distance 
between the boxes could be shortened to about a quarter-mile in most areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The call boxes definitely will increase the safety level on our highways," 
Supervisor Williams said. "Before, when you stalled along the highway, you had 
to either wait in your car for help, sometimes for a very long time, or walk to 
get help yourself. And it was that situation that often led to trouble or 
tragedy. The phones will reduce those hazards, both in terms of getting quicker 
help for individuals and making sure that disabled cars don't stay on or 
alongside the road so long that they become an additional hazard." 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials said that, to date, the vast majority of calls -- 815 of 1,069 
during one week last month -- have come from drivers whose cars were out of gas 
or were disabled by mechanical problems. In those cases, the CHP will either 
contact an emergency road service crew or the driver's family for help, or send 
a patrol car to assist. Reports of accidents or traffic hazards are other 
common reasons the phones are used. 
</P>
<P>
While no major emergency calls have been received, said Katie Deuel, a CHP 
communications supervisor, there have been a number of comical calls, many of 
them from motorists who mistakingly assume that the boxes can be used like 
normal public pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for example, when a CHP dispatcher asked a businessman who was using the 
call box to describe his problem, he said that his pager had gone off and he 
needed to contact his office. On another occasion, a woman asked the dispatcher 
to contact her husband to remind him to bring their dog inside their house when 
it was raining. The Highway Patrol also frequently receives calls from drivers 
seeking directions, Deuel said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get calls like that, we have to tell people that that isn't the 
purpose of the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the final hurdles remaining for the project involves efforts to make the 
emergency phones more accessible to handicapped drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a group of disabled drivers tried unsuccessfully to halt 
installation of the call boxes until the phones were redesigned or modified to 
provide better access. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you want us wheelchair drivers to not be equally protected from harm?" 
Noel Neudeck of Del Cerro asked in a letter to county Supervisor George Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
SAFE officials, while emphasizing that the boxes' design was approved by the 
California Department of Transportation, concede that many of the phones are 
located in places where freeway shoulders are too narrow to accommodate 
vehicles equipped with wheelchair lifts. At the site of other call boxes, 
berms, guardrails or elevated shoulder slopes make it difficult or impossible 
for those in wheelchairs to reach the phones. 
</P>
<P>
While local officials declined to further postpone the already much-delayed 
project in the face of those objections, SAFE awarded a contract in November to 
Thomas Komar, an architect who is handicapped, to recommend changes on how 
access could be enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
Komar, who estimates that about half the call box sites present at least some 
problems to handicapped people, said many of those difficulties could be solved 
through relatively simple modifications, such as cutting through the curb-like 
berms or constructing a small ramp next to the poles on which the phones are 
situated. His report on those options -- which as yet do not have cost 
estimates attached -- may be completed by next month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the existing curb configurations could be traversed by wheelchairs, 
but then you get into the degree of safety," Komar said. "To make it more 
suitable and safer, some physical modifications would be needed." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, however, argues that the question of handicapped access can be better 
-- and, perhaps, less expensively -- addressed by installing cellular phones in 
handicapped drivers' vehicles than by altering the call box sites. Although 
normal cellular phones cost hundreds of dollars, Williams said, he believes 
units designed to activate only the call boxes would be less costly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to recognize that we can never make it totally safe for a 
person in a wheelchair to get out of his car to use one of these phones along 
the freeways," Williams said. "Guardrails and the narrow roadsides are enough 
of a problem even to people who can walk. It makes more sense to try to find a 
way to give handicapped people access (to the phones) from inside their cars." 
</P>
<P>
The price tag and possible funding source for cellular phones for handicapped 
drivers, assuming that approach is ultimately adopted, has not yet been 
determined, Williams said. However, he suggested that revenue generated by the 
$1 annual registration fee or state and federal grants perhaps could be used 
for that purpose.

Photo, A Look at Life in the Slow Lane -- The recently opened San Diego 
Automotive Museum in Balboa Park offers visitors a peek at how motorists coped

WEATHER TO WARM UP A LITTLE TODAY, TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weather will warm up slightly over the next two days, pushing daytime 
temperatures into the low 60s for the first time in weeks, according to the 
National Weather Service. Even so, it will still be unseasonably cool in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the high is around 65 and the low is 48 this time of year," said 
forecaster Richard Stitt. "So even though it looks pretty good over Southern 
California for Monday and Tuesday, it's still cool." 
</P>
<P>
The clear skies and warmer days will be short-lived, however. San Diegans can 
expect more rainfall by Wednesday, and a cloudy weekend, Stitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal and inland high temperatures will be 57 to 63 degrees today and 60 to 
66 degrees Tuesday. The beaches will stay slightly cooler, and the daytime 
mountain temperatures will fall in the upper 30s today and in the 40s Tuesday, 
according to the weather service forecast. 
</P>
<P>
The nights will also be slightly warmer than in recent weeks, with low 
temperatures along the coast in the low 40s tonight, with inland lows in the 
upper 30s. The mountains will stay cold tonight, at 18 to 28 degrees, according 
to the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no snow or rain tonight, Stitt said -- unlike Saturday night, 
when icy temperatures brought two new inches of snow to both Cuyamaca State 
Park and Palomar Mountain. No snow-related problems were reported by the 
California Highway Patrol over the weekend, except "a lot of fender-benders" on 
mountain roads, said a CHP spokeswoman.

A genetic defect passed on only by mothers to their children has been linked to 
some eye disorders and a type of epilepsy and may be responsible for even more 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
By analyzing patterns of genetic inheritance among several large Georgia 
families and analyzing specific genes, Emory University scientists linked 
genetic flaws in mitochondria, the cell's energy producing bodies, to three 
inherited diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published recently in the journal Cell, the researchers linked 
mitochondrial defects to a rare disease of the central nervous system called 
myoclonic epilepsy. Its symptoms range from deafness and dementia to breathing 
difficulties and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer -- in the first discovery linking mitochondria to an inherited 
disease -- the Emory team reported it associated a mitrochondrial defect to a 
puzzling form of blindness, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. 
</P>
<P>
The Emory researchers said their discovery may be an important step toward 
diagnosis and treatment of many previously unexplained diseases of the brain, 
heart and nervous system.

CHILD'S FANCY HAS FATHER FIGHTING FOR MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most parents buy their 10-year-old girls doll houses or their first formal 
dress. Rod Daniels wants to buy his daughter a historical mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, 42, of Granada Hills has been trying for months to purchase and 
renovate the McKinley Mansion, a Los Angeles landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The house, built in the style of the Italian Renaissance, is the subject of a 
bitter fight involving its owner -- who wants to tear it down -- cultural 
preservationists, and Los Angeles city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels wants to move the mansion, now on Lafayette Park Place in the Westlake 
area of Los Angeles, to Granada Hills. The 13,000-square-foot mansion would sit 
on 2 1/2 acres down the street from Daniels' present residence. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember going out not long ago to see the McKinley house with my daughter, 
Shevie, when we heard it was going to be torn down," Daniels recalled Friday. 
"Shevie said, 'Daddy, that's the mansion you've been promising me.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clan to the Aid 
</P>
<P>
Although Daniels said he doesn't have the $4.5 million in the bank that would 
be needed to buy the mansion, he indicated that family and friends have said 
they would help. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Daniels family, a large clan that has been buying property and 
restoring houses for several years. Most have been single-family homes built 
after 1948, but none has the prestige and magnitude of the McKinley Mansion, 
which is on Los Angeles' official list of historic cultural monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the excitement in pursuing it, Daniels said: "The family already 
have all their rooms picked out." 
</P>
<P>
He said he promised his daughter a house where she could live when she got 
older. A previous house that Daniels lived in was turned over to his 
22-year-old son. His present home will eventually be turned over to his 
16-year-old son "when he gets 18 years old or becomes more responsible." 
</P>
<P>
"We want nice places for the kids to live," Daniels said. "So I'm going through 
all this trouble for Shevie. She didn't want to see the house torn down." 
</P>
<P>
The Daniels family takes its development dreams seriously. One of Daniels' 
dreams, for example, would be to move the 500-room, newly closed Ambassador 
Hotel from Wilshire Boulevard to Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can put a man on the moon, we can move that hotel," Daniels said. "Of 
course, it would take millions of dollars. But I would like to give a damn hard 
try." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overtures Rejected 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the McKinley Mansion, Jason Lee, has rejected Daniels' overtures. 
Lee has been going through a lot of trouble to demolish the mansion, while the 
Los Angeles Conservancy, a private organization dedicated to saving and 
revitalizing historical monuments, is going through a lot of trouble to save 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Lee wants to build a 140-unit apartment complex on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, he hired contractors to demolish the house after obtaining a 
permit that Los Angeles city officials later determined had been issued by 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained about the demolition, and police and a building inspector 
intervened. But before officials could revoke the permit, the front patio 
superstructure and adjacent arbor had been smashed, and a number of gashes had 
been made in the main part of the house. 
</P>
<P>
City officials Thursday gave hope to Daniels and the preservationists when they 
granted a temporary reprieve on the mansion's destruction. They ordered Lee to 
cease demolition, to weatherproof the building and to repair the damage within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said that in the meantime, he would try to talk to Lee and buy the 
house. He took it upon himself to place plastic sheets on the roof to protect 
the exterior from rain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Lee could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Big Project' 
</P>
<P>
"This would be a big project, moving that house out here," Daniels said. "But 
the heck with worrying about how tough it would be. The Valley just doesn't 
have that many historical monuments, and this would be a perfect home for this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials said they would be happy to see the mansion pass into 
Daniels' hands. "We consider Mr. Daniels to be a very serious and concerned 
person who has excellent intentions for the house," said Jay Rounds, executive 
director of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Daniels were to get possession of the house, Rounds said, he would 
prefer that Daniels leave it where it is. "We would like to see it stand as a 
reminder of earlier periods and history of the area. Once that context is lost, 
a significant historical status is lost. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it's necessary for the home to be moved in order to preserve it, then 
we would be happy for the Daniels to be the ones to move it," Rounds said. 
</P>
<P>
It would take about $2.5 million to buy the desired site and move the McKinley 
house from Los Angeles to Granada Hills, Daniels said. The house would have to 
be moved in sections, and it would take about a year before it could be 
reassembled and ready for habitation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the house where it is would cost much more, Daniels said. "In its 
present state, it would take about $6.5 million to buy and fix up," he said. 
"At that cost, and with the value of the property, we would probably wind up 
selling to someone else who would just tear it down anyway. Plus, it doesn't 
fit in that area anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Remnant 
</P>
<P>
The mansion, which was built in 1917 by Maytor H. McKinley, a mortuary 
operator, is surrounded by apartment buildings. It is the last of a handful of 
large family homes that dominated Lafayette Park Place. 
</P>
<P>
If the house is moved, an association of interior designers has already 
expressed interest in making it a model home, which would save the Daniels 
family significant renovation costs. The society would pay for the interior 
design in exchange for rights to show the house and the publicity that would 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Broderick, a member of the society, said that means the house would 
probably be open for a month to the public after renovation before Shevie and 
the family moved in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special project," Daniels said. "I hope we can preserve this history." 
</P>
<P>
If not, they've still got the Ambassador to look forward to.

CHARITIES HOPE PROGRAM PROMPTS RESTAURANTS TO DONATE LEFTOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley restaurants are not yet standing in line to give their 
leftover food to charities, despite a new law that removes liability for the 
businesses should someone become ill from the food. 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers predict that enthusiasm for putting leftovers to use 
will increase later this month with the advent of a program called Second 
Helpings. 
</P>
<P>
Under Second Helpings, the California Restaurant Assn. will act as a matchmaker 
for restaurants and charities, leaving them to iron out details of their 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, what we've heard from our members is this is a good idea -- a way 
to be able to do something to help out without having a major burden put on 
them," said Stanley Kyker, executive vice president of the California 
Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Good Samaritan law," which took effect Jan. 1, was sponsored by 
the restaurant association because large quantities of restaurant food were 
being thrown away. This was partly because of concerns about liability and the 
county's strict interpretation of state health regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Any restaurants and charities can negotiate to distribute leftovers on their 
own. But except for the handful that had previous arrangements, none of several 
contacted had plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
When a proposal for Second Helpings was mailed statewide last year to all 2,900 
members of the restaurant association, who represent 9,000 food service 
businesses, the results were disappointing, said Alberta Hultman, assistant 
executive vice president. Only about 100 agreed to participate, she said. Of 
these, about a dozen were in Los Angeles County and only two were in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, one of the two Valley establishments, Polar Palace Frozen Yogurt in 
Van Nuys, has gone out of business. The other, the Calabasas Inn, plans to 
donate raw food such as bags of rice, coffee and fruit, which would be useful 
only to charities that have cooking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have food left over that often, so it's not something we could 
promise on a regular basis," said Wally Hollenstein, owner of the 150-seat 
Calabasas Inn. "Besides, I'm not so much in favor of sending the poor what you 
have left. . . . They deserve fresh food too." 
</P>
<P>
Kyker said he was surprised by the small response, but a second brochure now 
being developed aims at educating restaurant owners and managers about the need 
for the program. As added incentive, the restaurant association is letting its 
members know they can claim tax deductions for the value of the donated food. 
</P>
<P>
Kyker said Valley restaurants may join if they see the program working smoothly 
for other Los Angeles-area restaurants. The restaurant association would not 
release a complete list of the restaurants that tentatively signed up after the 
statewide mailing. Hultman said most are family-style restaurants, not 
fast-food or gourmet establishments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Connection 
</P>
<P>
"The key will be getting that connection between the agency and the restaurant 
operator so that it is convenient for the restaurateur," Kyker said. "If it 
becomes too much of a burden for them so that it costs more, they aren't going 
to want to continue, and others won't want to join them." 
</P>
<P>
Some representatives of Valley charities were pessimistic about the likelihood 
of widespread participation. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is that in the Valley, there's always been a strong feeling that 
there's not a homeless problem out here," said Vernon Windell, program 
coordinator for the Cornerstone, a Van Nuys mental health counseling center for 
the homeless. "Restaurateurs, if they see the problem, they see it as a problem 
for them -- people poking in their dumpsters, stiffing them on the bill." 
</P>
<P>
But, Hultman said, she thinks that all restaurateurs became more aware of the 
destitute after Proposition 95, the Hunger and Homelessness Funding Initiative 
on November's ballot, drew a 45% yes vote. Among other things, the proposition 
proposed fining restaurants for state Health Code violations, then using the 
fines to pay for food, shelter and job training for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Awareness 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are much more aware of the issue, that we as individuals have to 
respond," Hultman said, "and that we have to let people know what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of excess food in Los Angeles restaurants has not been measured, but 
people's digging in restaurant dumpsters is testimony that edible food is 
wasted, said Michael Vasquez, director of the Hollywood Project for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Before the August closure of Hollywood's well-known Tick Tock restaurant, 
Vasquez said, he and his staff were allowed to come to the back door with 
plastic containers at 9 p.m., when the kitchen closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We would get enough from the Tick Tock in one evening to feed about 50 
people," he said. "There would be whole turkey dinners, good quality soup and 
steamed vegetables. All of it still hot, coming right out of the kitchen. I sit 
back and imagine: When we got that much from just one restaurant, how many 
restaurants are throwing away at least that much?" 
</P>
<P>
A telephone survey of major Valley charities -- including the Salvation Army, 
the San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center and Valley Shelter -- 
showed that most rarely receive restaurant leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the exceptions are Better Valley Services, a nonprofit housing agency in 
Van Nuys, where homeless people sometimes feast on steaks and other delicacies 
originally prepared for film crews by Movieland Caterers of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away in Granada Hills, Robert Maxwell, the supervisor of the Index 
Street Group Home, stops at a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise most Saturdays 
to pick up buckets of unsold chicken for the boys under his care. Other group 
homes have similar arrangements with the fast-food chicken chain. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen other charities, including the Union Rescue Mission, participate in a 
leftover food program of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Under that 
program, unserved school lunches began being passed on to the needy in 
December, 1987, when three charities, the first to join, signed waivers saying 
the school would not be held responsible if someone became ill from the food. 
</P>
<P>
Valley restaurant managers defended their records, saying they occasionally 
give certificates for free dinners to favorite churches or charities. None 
contacted were aware of the new law, and none wanted to rush into a commitment 
with Second Helpings. In fact, many insisted that they do not have much 
leftover food anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little to Offer 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing really is made up ahead of time, so there really isn't that much left 
over," said Pat Rosate, manager of the White Horse Inn in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"This restaurant is a buffet, so we mostly use our own leftover food," said 
John Alevras, manager of a Taste of Scandinavia Smorgasbord on Ventura 
Boulevard in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But Hultman of the restaurant association said that while a restaurant's goal 
is to not generate much waste, "there are always those daily specials that are 
not that popular with the customers. . . . We want there to be no waste at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
A few charities also said they feared that handling leftovers would be 
cumbersome, particularly because the Second Helpings program gives them 
responsibility for picking up the food. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately we don't have vehicles to go out and pick something up, so 
usually the staff uses their own vehicles," said Darcy Scott, executive 
director of Better Valley Services. "If they had something left over in the 
middle of the day so that we could put it out like a buffet, sure, that would 
be great. But if they called in the middle of night, it would be awkward." 
</P>
<P>
Charities involved with the school district struggle with this problem, too. 
Some have solved it in part by not depending on the school food, using it only 
as a supplement to their regular meals, said Beth Louargand, a deputy 
administrator with the district. 
</P>
<P>
Kyker said the restaurant association hopes to provide some transportation 
services through Food Partnership, a nonprofit organization that carries mostly 
non-perishable food donations to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. But, he 
said, even if Food Partnership agrees to help, he would not be able to promise 
delivery to all charities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcome Relief 
</P>
<P>
For the few Valley restaurants that have been willing to donate leftovers 
despite liability risks, the new law is welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Movieland Caterers, Allan Stearns, said Better Valley Services and 
other charities with which the catering firm works assured him that he would 
not be held responsible if someone were to get sick after eating his food, "but 
we were always concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the law, Collins Foods International, which owns 118 Kentucky 
Fried Chicken restaurants in Southern California, started offering local 
charities leftover chicken four months ago. Previously, an estimated 1,500 
pieces a week were being wasted because the company is barred from selling 
cooked chicken that is more than 90 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to get it out of the trash bins anyway, so it seems better to 
give it to them outright than see them out there digging for it," said Gregory 
Reheis, director of administration for the Kentucky Fried Chicken branch of 
Collins Foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Criticized 
</P>
<P>
In the past, charities and some restaurant owners have criticized the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health for its strict interpretation of state laws 
governing transfer of cooked food, which included stringent standards for 
packaging, temperature control and record-keeping. They cited other 
metropolitan areas in the state where county officials are more lenient and 
food donations are more common. 
</P>
<P>
But Arthur Tilzer, the department's director for consumer protection, said the 
county's stance has been prudent, not stingy. He blamed restaurants, not county 
rules, for the lack of a coordinated leftover food giveaway program. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was really that much of a demand from the industry to 
participate in a redistribution program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new Good Samaritan law, state health regulations are circumvented 
when the charity agrees to take the food and along with it the responsibility 
for making sure it is safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Tilzer said the county is working closely with Second Helpings to establish 
food handling guidelines and will conduct spot checks of restaurants and 
charities to make sure the food is being properly stored.

PEACE SYMBOL GETS A WARMER RECEPTION 2ND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MORELAND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernie Torres worried about his neighbors' reaction to a large, wooden peace 
symbol he hung in front of his Northridge home last month as a Christmas 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
He remembered the adverse response to a peace symbol he displayed in front of a 
Canoga Park house during the height of the Vietnam War. In those politically 
charged days, the peace symbol meant "you were member of the anti-war minority, 
a Commie," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back, I'm surprised nobody burned down the house. It was a very 
conservative neighborhood," he added. But that was then and this is now, Torres 
reasoned. And even though times had changed, hanging a large peace symbol could 
spark controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked myself, 'Do you want to bring that age back?' Those weren't the best 
of times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres, 46, hung the peace sign, complete with lights to illuminate it at 
night. To his surprise, the response has been positive and his peace symbol, 
still in Torres' front yard, has served as the catalyst to some rather 
surprising events. 
</P>
<P>
When one of Torres' sons, an Army private stationed at Ft. Benning, Ga., saw 
the huge peace symbol, he wanted his picture taken next to it. His mother, 
Karen Torres, eagerly shows visitors the photograph of her son in his dress 
uniform standing next to the peace symbol, his arms stretched above his head 
and his fingers making the "V" peace salute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Knew What it Was' 
</P>
<P>
One evening when the Torres family forgot to light the symbol, a trio of high 
school girls, who said they were worried that the family had taken it down, 
appeared at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew what it was and said they loved it," Karen Torres recalled. "They 
said that there were peace symbol earrings, and peace symbol T-shirts. It seems 
like there's a revival of the peace symbol. It's neat." 
</P>
<P>
The Torres' peace symbol even has had a calming affect on a cluster of dorms at 
Cal State Northridge across the street from the family's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is, but since that thing went up, everyone here seems to 
have mellowed out," said David Flinn, a resident of the North Campus complex. 
"Maybe it was the Christmas vacation, maybe it was the holiday spirit. But the 
peace symbol is still up and the mellowness is still here." 
</P>
<P>
The only controversy generated by the Torres' peace symbol is a ongoing family 
debate over whether to leave it up or take it down. Daughter Jill, 17, and her 
high school friends want it to be a permanent front yard fixture. "They think 
it's cool," she said.

Whatever the final outcome, Torres said he is going to take his time making up 
his mind.

"It went over so big, if we take it down, we're going to get a lot of protest," 
he said with a laugh.

INFANT ABANDONED ON SIMI VALLEY DOORSTEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Sunday were seeking information about a newborn who was abandoned at 
the front door of a Simi Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
The one- or two-day-old boy, wearing a T-shirt and diaper and wrapped in a 
towel, was left at the home of Valerie Carrillo on Chandler Avenue about noon 
Saturday, Carrillo told police. She said her son, John, 15, found the infant 
when he answered the doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo said the baby looks healthy, weighs about 7 pounds and has dark hair. 
His umbilical cord seems to have been cut with scissors and not clamped, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The infant appears to be a full-term baby that was not delivered in a hospital, 
said Sgt. Neal Rein of the Simi Valley Police Department. The baby was admitted 
to Simi Valley Adventist Hospital for observation, where he was in stable 
condition Sunday night, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just thankful that we were home," said Carrillo, an engineering 
technician. "It was a shock to open up and see something so special on the 
doorstep. . . . You always hear about it, but you don't ever think it's going 
to happen to you."

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers, those Nanooks of the north (California), cut through 
frost-biting winds and teeth-chattering reputations to put an end to a few 
myths and the Chicago Bears on Sunday, winning the National Football Conference 
title with a chilling, if not thrilling, 28-3 win at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
The team that won the title here did it in the face of 29-m.p.h. winds and 
temperatures that dipped to a wind-chill factor of minus-26 degrees, freezing 
the sweat on players' faces. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first quarter, my feet were frozen," 49er defensive end Larry 
Roberts said. "I couldn't feel my feet." 
</P>
<P>
And it figured. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers came east with images as wine tasters of football, admirers of fine 
food and finesse offense. They lugged some 1,500 pounds of cold-weather 
equipment to Chicago -- rubber-soled shoes, anti-cold creams, bun warmers. 
</P>
<P>
They came east with history's deck stacked against them. The 49ers hadn't won a 
road playoff game in 18 years. No NFC team had won a title on the road since 
the 1979 season. 
</P>
<P>
But figuring perhaps they were the better team, the 49ers came anyway, and 
warmed themselves by hurdling through the Chicago defense, trouncing the Bears 
on their field, in what was supposed to be Bear weather. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're so tough," 49er cornerback Tim McKyer was saying afterward, "why 
did all that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
What happens next is the 49ers, in a rematch of the 1982 Super Bowl, will face 
the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl Jan. 22 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami climate will be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the 49ers' feet were most certainly cold Sunday, it didn't mean 
they jumped into the game with cold feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring thermometers and numbing limbs, the 49ers stuck to their game plan, 
the first 25 plays of which were scripted the night before, as always. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of running on a frozen field, which is the conventional wisdom, San 
Francisco came at the Bears with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. It was wisdom of 
another kind. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy took the Bears by surprise, and even a few 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me," Roberts said. "I didn't expect us to move the ball on offense. 
I thought it would be a 7-6 game, or 10-9 like last time. But we moved the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Move it they did, scoring with 3:18 left in the first quarter when Montana 
fired in the right flat for Rice, who broke free as Bear corner Mike Richardson 
collided with safety Todd Krumm. Rice raced 61 yards untouched for the 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe told me the ball might not be right where I wanted it to be, and I would 
have to make a play on it," Rice said. "And I did." 
</P>
<P>
If Montana was having trouble with the wind, it wasn't apparent. He teamed with 
Rice again in the second quarter, reading a Chicago blitz and dumping the ball 
to Rice over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Montana called this a "hot read," meaning he was to read the blitz and look for 
the tight end, John Frank. Frank wasn't open, but Rice had broken free of 
cornerback Vestee Jackson, made the catch in open field and then cruised for 
the touchdown, a 27-yard play. It helped put the 49ers up, 14-0, with 7:25 left 
in the half, a lead that seemed commanding given the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Working in almost unbearable conditions, Montana seemed undaunted by the winds 
or Bear defense. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Chicago quarterback Jim McMahon, who wore gloves but lacked any touch, 
Montana threw with a bare hand and uncanny accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have been his greatest game, under the conditions," 49er Coach Bill 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Montana almost shrugged off the conditions and claimed he actually 
had a "good feel of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
By the half, he had completed 9 of 15 passes for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
McMahon struggled. Through the first 30 minutes, he threw for 94 yards, and his 
one interception, by 49er safety Jeff Fuller, set up San Francisco's second 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Montana is a man of few words and little emotion, but the victory obviously was 
one of the biggest of his storied career. It was a crowning finish to a season 
in which Montana had outlasted a quarterback controversy with Steve Young and 
lingering questions about whether he was fit. Walsh had even sent Montana to 
the bench on occasion this year, citing injuries and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel I was ever hurt," Montana said. "Bill felt I was, and he has the 
right to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
All that seemed so far away from Soldier Field and Sunday's victory, but it 
seemed important to remember there was a time this season when the 49ers were 
6-5 and Montana's career was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We all had something to prove," Montana said, not wishing to make this a 
personal vindication. "I never gave up. My wife kept me in line and kept my 
spirits up." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's performance -- 17-of-27 passing for 288 yards and 3 touchdowns -- 
will be remembered far longer than the one turned in by his offensive line, 
which kept Montana frost-free most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The vaunted Bears' pass rush disappeared into the cone of silence formed around 
Montana, who was provided enough time to pick the Bears apart. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bears blitzed -- and they did often -- the 49ers' line picked up the 
rusher, exposing Chicago's cornerbacks to one-on-one coverage against Rice. 
</P>
<P>
It was a defensive strategy unappreciated by the Bears' Jackson, who claimed he 
didn't have the footing to stay with Rice. Does anyone ever? 
</P>
<P>
The Bears' defense was left reeling. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Mike 
Singletary, the Bears' menace of the midway, was seemingly lost in the cold 
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no one around the guy," Singletary complained about the pass rush. 
"It makes it very tough. We're supposed to play like professionals on every 
down, and it doesn't make any difference how good of game someone else has, our 
game should be just as good. . . . If I sound frustrated, I am frustrated. If I 
sound mad, I am mad." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco pushed and picked and pestered the Bears' defense to no end, 
taking over after the third-quarter kickoff and marching 78 yards on 13 plays 
for a touchdown that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who finished with 5 catches for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns, set up the 
score with a 12-yard reception down to the Bear 5-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
On first down, Montana went for the jugular, floating a lob pass for Rice in 
the end zone's right corner. Rice made an outstretched stab at the ball, but it 
was ruled he didn't have control when he and the ball hit the ground 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief instant-replay stink, Montana calmly set up again and hit Frank 
for the touchdown, putting the 49ers up, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco used up 5:27 on the drive, though it seemed an eternity for 
McMahon and the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Those 49ers who had chased McMahon before claimed he wasn't the same 
quarterback Sunday, lacking the mobility to get him out of trouble. McMahon 
made an appearance in last week's victory over Philadelphia, but had 
essentially been out since Oct. 30 with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to stare at their receivers," 49er safety Fuller said. "It's worked 
for them in the past, partially because he was a better runner then and could 
get out of the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Michael Carter noticed the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he was uncomfortable out there," he said of McMahon. "He always had 
someone chasing him and he could never set up to pass." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak, who completed 6 of 12 passes for 55 yards, replaced McMahon in 
the fourth quarter, the game having long been decided. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers got their fourth touchdown when Tom Rathman rushed in from 4 yards 
out with 6:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
All the Bears had to show for the day was a Kevin Butler field goal and some 
frozen memories. 
</P>
<P>
Rathman, who tried to make light of the weather afterward, claiming he had been 
well-prepared at Nebraska, soon confessed to the Big Lie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was freezing out there, to tell you the truth," Rathman said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, frostbite never hurts as much when you win. 
</P>
<P>
NFC Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. said afterward he wasn't sure whether 
his coach, Bill Walsh, would retire after the season. "I don't know," DeBartolo 
said. "He might. It's up to him." He added that even if Walsh retired, he would 
remain with the organization in some capacity. "Bill's got a year on his 
contract and I'd like him to fulfill it," DeBartolo said. "But he can coach as 
long as he likes."

A COUPLE OF WEIRD GOALS GIVE WINNIPEG A 4-4 TIE WITH KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Goalie Mark Fitzpatrick of the Kings knew it was going to be a crazy game when 
that puck that was pushed toward the boards early in the first period, the puck 
that he expected to rim around the glass and drop harmlessly behind his net, 
somehow hit a metal post and came at him like lightning. He didn't even have 
time to react before the red light came on behind him. 
</P>
<P>
In the official scoring, it's recorded as Dave Ellett's first goal of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Ellett's second goal, the score that Ellett put into the 
wide open net while his buddy Laurie Boschman was still on top of Fitzpatrick, 
having just crashed into Fitzpatrick and slammed him to the ice, clear of the 
goal, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick went looking for an interference ruling on that play. But the goal 
stood. 
</P>
<P>
So even after Luc Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky had come through with their 
long-awaited goals in the later stages of the third period, the Kings were 
locked in a 4-4 tie with the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a crazy night. 
</P>
<P>
These teams have played 4 straight overtime games and have ended up with 3 
straight ties. Which they did again Sunday night. Nobody scored in the overtime 
to leave the score 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the way these teams play to the limit. Maybe it was the magic of 
Gretzky. Whatever. The really crazy thing about the game Sunday night was the 
crowd. Those crazy hockey fans, all 15,094 of them, made their way through 
brutal weather to the Winnipeg Arena to witness another tie. 
</P>
<P>
The blizzard that began during the Kings' game here Friday night continued 
until Sunday morning, burying the city in white. But even after the snow had 
finally stopped falling, the combination of blowing snow, icy streets and 
temperatures that dipped to minus-20 degrees at game time made it a ridiculous 
night to be out on the town. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd fell about 300 fans short of a sellout, but it was the fifth-largest 
crowd of the season at the Winnipeg Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The blizzard was so bad on Saturday that the World Wrestling Federation card at 
the Arena had to be canceled because Randy (Macho Man) Savage and Miss 
Elizabeth could not fly in. 
</P>
<P>
Harness racing was also canceled. 
</P>
<P>
But not hockey. Not with the Kings holed up in a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
To check on the snowfall, players had to wander down to the lobby and look out 
the front door. All the windows were iced over. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a tough trip for the Kings, who lost at Calgary before coming to 
Winnipeg for two ties that stretched their winless streak to five games. The 
Kings are 0-3-2 since winning at Vancouver Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' hold on second place in the Smythe Division is in danger. With a 
record of 24-15-3, the Kings have 51 points. Edmonton, the team that they will 
play at the Forum Tuesday, now has a record of 23-15-4 for 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had tried to take all of the blame for the team's slump after the tie 
Friday night. And Sunday, even after scoring the tying goal on a swoop behind 
the Jets' net for the wrap-around score, Gretzky was not jumping for joy. 
</P>
<P>
He was still pointing out the strengths of his teammates but noting his own 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Robbie Ftorek said that he wasn't too surprised at that. "I don't 
agree with him (in judging himself so harshly), but I understand why he's 
feeling that way," Ftorek said. "That's what a good hockey player would do. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a confident player, and when things don't happen the way you visualize 
them, the way you expect them to go, you're disappointed. You never look 
anywhere else but at yourself. That's the mark of a good hockey player. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Only special people really see themselves as the ones to blame. The only thing 
that matters to a winner is wins. There are a lot of little things that don't 
show up on the scorecard that matter a lot to him." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, though, the Kings seemed to be coming around in the third period 
when they were even in shots on goal (although they were outshot, 36-26 in the 
game) and they outscored the Jets, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek had no complaints about the third period. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli had skated right at Pokey Reddick early in the third period to put 
the Kings within a goal at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes later Fitzpatrick was knocked to the ice and Ellett stretched 
the Jets' lead back to 4-2 at 7:04. 
</P>
<P>
It went down as an unassisted goal, but Ellett got a big assist from Boschman, 
taking Fitzpatrick out of the play and leaving the net wide open for Ellett. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick said: "The officials said that Doug Crossman knocked Boschman into 
me, but Crossman says he didn't, and people who saw it on the TV replay 
upstairs tell me he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzpatrick didn't let that setback bother him any more than he let that 
shot off the glass bother him in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
As Robitaille points out: "Fitzpatrick doesn't act like a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
He just dug in and shut them out the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille got the goal back at 10:45 of the period on a power play, putting in 
a pass from Bernie Nicholls, and Gretzky tied the game on his wrap-around shot 
after taking a pass from Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear Wayne asking for the puck, you give it to him," Robitaille said 
with a big grin. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 4-4 tie on Friday night, when the Kings gave up the late goals and 
felt pretty low when it was over, it was the Kings who came back to get the tie 
Sunday, and they seemed a little more upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek said: "After our first period -- we'll take the tie." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick gave up 2 quick goals early on, Pat Elynuik skating past 
Fitzpatrick on the right side of the goal and taking a pass from Brent Ashton, 
who had drawn Fitzpatrick out to cut off what looked to be a shot coming from 
the left side. 
</P>
<P>
After the Elynuik goal at 6:09, Boschman won the faceoff and passed the puck to 
Ellett, who swept the puck toward the boards in a move that everyone, including 
Fitzpatick, thought would send the puck skimming neatly around the curve and 
behind the net. But the puck hit metal and the Jets were up, 2-0, at 6:27. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Duchesne made it 2-1 for the Kings at 10:43 on a shot from the top of the 
left circle that apparently glanced off a skate and past Reddick. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, Doug Smail skated around Crossman on a breakaway and put 
the puck into the right corner of the Kings' net at 8:39, right between 
Fitzpatrick's pads. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing could top that weird shot off the glass. "That's something that 
will happen one time out of a thousand," Fitzpatrick said. "All you can do is 
laugh about it, say it was a crazy goal, that it's early in the game and then 
bear down again. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I learned from it. They had a couple more off the glass like that in 
the third period, but I was more ready for them."

MIKE DOWNEY: KNEE IS JUST ANOTHER IN LINE OF BAD TWISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Abandoning San Diego aside, what did the Los Angeles Clippers ever do to hurt 
anybody? What did they do to deserve to be dumped on this way? Why have they 
become the Curly Howards of professional basketball, yanked and jerked and 
poked and slapped, their faces full of whipped cream and their noses attached 
to a long pair of pliers? Huh? How come? 
</P>
<P>
If a Clipper gets caught in the rain, must his umbrella not open? If a Clipper 
drops a coin under a refrigerator, must his hand then get snagged in a 
mousetrap? If a Clipper parks his car on the street, must a pigeon fly by? What 
makes these lugs so unlucky? 
</P>
<P>
Heard the latest? Danny Manning is out. Out for a long time. Maybe out for the 
season. Maybe out even longer. Yes, Danny Manning, mister No. 1 draft choice, 
mister franchise turner-arounder, mister better-late-than-never. Nice career, 
babe. He started 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's right knee is a mess, hyper-extended at the least, ripped ligament at 
the most. Some players never recover from ligament damage of the kind that 
might presently be afflicting Manning. Even if he does come back, there is no 
assurance that he will have that same spring in his step that he did while 
leading Kansas to the national collegiate championship, that bounce he had the 
day he finally signed with the Clippers and stepped right onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
Poor ole Clips. What a drag. This could be the unluckiest sports franchise in 
creation. Think of the things that have happened to Marques Johnson and Bill 
Walton and Norman Nixon. Think of the guys who got away, among them Terry 
Cummings and James Donaldson and Byron Scott. Think of the injuries that have 
racked up the promising draft choices of the past 2 seasons, leaving the 
Clippers low and lonely as ever. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday night's loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, the 
Clippers have won 39 of their last 196 games. Can you believe those numbers? 
The team that used to play the Harlem Globetrotters did better than that. The 
Clippers haven't had a winning season since 1978-79 -- a full decade now. Know 
what their overall record is in this decade? After Sunday's game: 245-525. 
</P>
<P>
To lose Manning now, adding injury to insult, is a little much. I mean, come 
on, man. The Clippers might be klutzes, but they are hardly slimy creeps. They 
do not rate this sort of shock treatment. They're just regular guys. They put 
their shoes on one at a time, same as everybody else, except possibly their 
center. All the Clippers want to do is dress up in their little costumes and 
dribble their basketballs and have hot water in the shower, just like every 
other team in the association. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the Clippers did not exactly figure on being a contender for the 
championship, but they definitely believed they could make a run at the 
playoffs. Say what they will about 3-year plans and 5-year plans, the Clippers 
sincerely felt they could make a run at one of the Western Conference's 
postseason bids this time, and don't you believe anybody who tells you 
otherwise. Once Manning stopped playing hard-to-get, the Clips were 
understandably proud of their personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the season, they had confidence. Gary Grant, the guard they drafted 
out of Michigan, got up before a preseason audience of friendly faces and said, 
with the trust-me wink of an auto salesperson, "You just put me out there, and 
I'll take care of the rest." 
</P>
<P>
There was every reason to believe the Clippers were on their way to somewhere 
after spending so much time stranded nowhere. Then, bad stuff began to happen. 
Bad stuff always happens to the Clippers. This time, there was Manning's 
holdout, and disheartening losses to the league's expansion clubs, and an 
injury to Charles Smith, who had been so impressive in the early going. Next 
thing anybody knew, Coach Gene Shue's squad was getting beat by huge margins, 
just like old times. 
</P>
<P>
When they played the Lakers about a week ago, the Clippers still had Manning, 
but they still had problems. Even on a night when the Lakers were out of their 
rhythm, the Clippers could do little about it. Manning, at least, had a nice 
night, and Ken Norman was his usual hard-working self, but there was nothing 
much to suggest that the Clippers were close to becoming, well, Laker-like. 
</P>
<P>
Winning Coach Pat Riley was kind to the Clippers that night. "I think they're 
right on schedule," he said. "I like a lot of what I see. And Manning's got the 
potential to be better than great. He can be another Magic (Johnson), if not in 
style of play, then in the impact he can have on his franchise." 
</P>
<P>
Days later, at Milwaukee, Manning fall down, go boom. Another pie in the face 
for the poor Clippers. The very man around whom they had built their ticket 
sales, their future, had been damaged and possibly totaled. Once again, 
advertising would have to center around the players the visiting teams would be 
using. 
</P>
<P>
We continue to believe, as we always have, that this franchise belongs in 
Orange County, where it would be welcome, and not Los Angeles, where it is not 
needed. Even a losing pro basketball team would be a novelty in greater 
metropolitan Anaheim, and who knows? Maybe a move would change the club's luck. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, if anybody can explain why the Clippers cannot seem to get a 
break, please do. As that country-western song goes, if it weren't for bad 
luck, they'd have no luck at all. These guys will win the National Basketball 
Assn. championship someday, then die from bad champagne.

SCOTT OSTLER: ASHFORD DOESN'T SLOW HER AGE IN OLYMPIC RELAY AT SEOUL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT OSTLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the Americans who watched the 1988 Olympics on television, the most 
excited of all must have been Raina Ashley Ashford, age 3, who gave a new 
meaning to that "thrill of victory" cliche. 
</P>
<P>
Raina was staying with her grandmother in Florida while mom and dad were in 
Seoul. Raina's mom is Evelyn Ashford, the second fastest woman sprinter in 
history, who anchored the U.S. 400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
It was a very exciting race, because Florence Joyner-Kersee and Evelyn botched 
their handoff and Evelyn had to play major-league catch-up to win the gold 
medal for the American team. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn re-creates the action back in grandma's living room: "Raina started to 
jump up and down when she saw me pass everyone. She was so excited she ran 
through the house, did a flip and threw up all over the place. Poor Raina. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got home she told me, 'You passed all those people, Mommy, I see you!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Raina slept through the telecast of the women's 100 meters, 
where mom won the silver medal. Raina is one of the few viewers whose lasting 
memory of the 1988 Olympic Games will be a beautiful performance by Evelyn 
Ashford. 
</P>
<P>
FloJo, of course, got more recognition last year for her fingernails than 
Ashford got for her entire body. A 31-year-old mother winning a gold and a 
silver medal in the biggest global sporting event of the decade should have 
rated more notice, but Evelyn's timing was bad. 
</P>
<P>
The world had never seen a FloJo. The speed. The fingernails. The smile. The 
lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I was overshadowed, yeah," Ashford said, evenly. "How can I say 
this? Yes, but I feel a great sense of accomplishment, and after all, that's 
why I do what I do -- for myself. I do a lot of clinics, and kids tell me I'm 
an inspiration to them. Florence inspires them in one way, I think I can 
inspire them in another." 
</P>
<P>
Ashford can dazzle them with her career, which has been fast and long, 13 years 
at the top, and as fast now as ever. Nobody runs this old, this fast. Evelyn 
Ashford is the female Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pioneer, and that's a little scary," Ashford said. "When you try to do 
something, you look at the person who came before, in some ways you try to 
emulate them. Right now I have no example to follow. Before me, sprinters 
retired at 23 or 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I run because I still like it, I can make a living, and I feel I was born to 
do it. And because people tell me I can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ashford holds the world record for being too old at the youngest age: 
18. She was a college freshman, with 1 year of high school sprinting behind 
her, when the school's track coach told her she was too old to start learning 
the art of sprinting. Evelyn ignored the advice, as well as the coach's 
insistence that she straighten out her forward-lean style. 
</P>
<P>
Actually she didn't ignore the advice. She used it as personal inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"The fastest way to get me to go out and do something is to tell me no way I 
can do it," Ashford said, not the slightest hint of levity in her tone. 
</P>
<P>
She made the 1976 U.S. Olympic team at age 19, missed the '80 Games because of 
the U.S. boycott, then in '84 won the 100 meters and anchored the winning 
100-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer's Olympics were FloJo's. But let's not forget that relay finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you when I panicked," Ashford said. "I panicked when I thought 
Florence would eat up that last turn, run right up my butt." 
</P>
<P>
FloJo did pass the East German and Soviet runners, but the U.S. lead was small 
as Griffith-Joyner approached Ashford. It was a terrible baton exchange, nearly 
disastrous. Evelyn got such a small piece of the stick that she wasn't sure 
whether she had a baton or a FloJo fingernail. All Evelyn knew was that the 
Soviet and East German runners were suddenly out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
What did Ashford say to herself at that moment? Did she say what some of us 
watching said -- "Oh, . . . "? 
</P>
<P>
Ashford: "That's exactly what I said -- 'Oh, . . . !' I just ran." 
</P>
<P>
She shut down her mind and shifted into Ashford Overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm running fast," she said, "I don't feel anything, it's effortless, 
it's like my feet don't even touch the ground, it's like I'm flying. I didn't 
feel that way in the 100, but I did on the relay." 
</P>
<P>
She flew past the Soviet and East German runners. 
</P>
<P>
Someone screamed at her, "The legend lives on!" 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that and I felt like a very old lady," Ashford said. 
</P>
<P>
But not so old that she isn't running again this season, starting with the 
Sunkist Invitational Jan. 20 at the Sports Arena, where she'll compete at 60 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
How about Barcelona in '92, when Evelyn will be 35? 
</P>
<P>
Ashford has thought about that. She has visualized herself running at 
Barcelona. Flying. But she is a realist. She feels that God gave her the 
precious gift of speed, that she truly was born to run . . . but not 
necessarily forever. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, Evelyn, if I may offer a bit of expert advice: Forget about Barcelona. 
It's a crazy idea. Ridiculous. Sprinting at 35? Please. Those kid runners will 
lap you. Take up knitting or gardening. You can't do it. No way.

ELLIOTT IS NAMED DRIVER OF THE YEAR; BRABHAM ALSO HONORED AT BANQUET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Elliott and Geoff Brabham shared the honors Saturday night at the American 
Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Assn. banquet in the Spruce Goose 
Pavilion at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott was named driver of the year by a panel of 10 racing writers over 
Brabham, Danny Sullivan and Rusty Wallace in the closest balloting ever. 
Elliott, Winston Cup stock car champion, received the most points in the 
1-through-5 voting although Wallace, the Winston Cup runnerup, had the most 
first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, International Motor Sports Assn. champion and winner of 8 straight 
races in mid-season, received the Jerry Titus Memorial Award for receiving the 
most votes in balloting among AARWBA members for the 12-driver All-America 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Proceedings were halted for more than an hour when Long Beach police had the 
Spruce Goose evacuated after a phone call was received alleging a bomb had been 
planted in the gigantic hanger. More than 600 guests took refuge in the Queen 
Mary before returning to the awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
All-America selectees present were Elliott, Wallace, Brabham, Sullivan, Bob 
Glidden, Kenny Bernstein, Al Unser Jr., Rich Vogler, Tom Kendall and Robby 
Gordon. Missing were Steve Kinser, who is racing in Australia, and Scott 
Pruett, whose mother accepted his award. SHAV GLICK

CLIPPERS THROW A GET-WELL PARTY FOR THE KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The travels and travails of the New York Knicks reached comedic proportions 
last Friday when the Atlantic Division leaders tried to get to Cleveland for 
the next day's showdown with the Cavaliers, the best team in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were supposed to leave on a 4 p.m. flight at LaGuardia Airport, only 
to have it cancelled because of bad weather. After checking into a hotel, they 
were re-booked on a 10:30 p.m. flight out of Kennedy Airport. That plane did 
leave -- at 2:15 a.m., putting the Knicks in Cleveland at 4 a.m., which, as it 
turned out, may have been the highlight of the day since they got blown out by 
the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, they have nothing on the Clippers, who, as if it's not already 
obvious, have gotten lost so many times on the road that they should be 
sponsored by the Auto Club of America. 
</P>
<P>
Following a 35-point loss at Indiana, the National Basketball Assn.'s cure for 
the common slump were bombed Sunday night by the Knicks, who hit 5 3-point 
shots in the second half, and 7 in all, in a 134-100 victory before a crowd of 
16,853 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
It was a close game at halftime, with New York leading, 54-48, and the Knicks 
needed a 16-6 run in the second quarter for that cushion. But the Clippers 
broke down in the second half, never able to find the right gear and not 
exactly looking like they were close, either. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks went ahead, 62-52, early in the third quarter and had a double-digit 
advantage the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost our continuity," Coach Gene Shue said. 
</P>
<P>
Added forward Joe Wolf: "I think we're just trying to find ourselves again." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who lost their fifth straight game on this trip to drop to 10-22 
overall, got hurt at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing had 26 points on 10-of-13 shooting, 11 rebounds and a season-high 
7 assists. Johnny Newman also had 26 points, hitting 11-of-15 shots, including 
all 4 from 3-point range. Charles Oakley had 17 rebounds and 12 points, Mark 
Jackson 14 points and 10 assists. The Knicks (21-11) finished the night by 
outscoring the Clippers, 42-22, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a New Year's resolution that we'd be one of the hardest-working teams 
in the NBA in the second half, and tonight we proved that," Coach Rick Pitino 
said after the Knicks won their 11th consecutive at home and beat the Clippers 
for the sixth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
The evening became complete with a fourth-quarter appearance of this town's 
latest basketball super hero, who isn't really a hero, just a second-round 
draft choice who surprised a lot of people by making the team. Still, who could 
have imagined this, the biggest ovation of the night going to Greg Butler, 
direct from Rolling Hills High School and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The city game once dominated by Willis Reed and Walt Frazier and, more 
recently, Ewing and Jackson, now has a cause celebre in Butler. The crowd began 
its lusty chant in the fourth quarter, cheering, "We Want Butler," over and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
They got him with 6:47 left when Ewing went out with the Knicks ahead, 111-92. 
That brought a roar, but nothing compared to when he grabbed Ken Norman's 
missed free throw. Forty-one seconds later, he scored his first basket on a 
fall-away baseline jumper, and the crowd erupted again. 
</P>
<P>
Final totals in his first appearance in 4 games: 7 minutes, 6 points, 3 
rebounds. And another night of unexpected fame. 
</P>
<P>
Would they believe this in Rolling Hills and his next-door hometown of Rancho 
Palos Verdes? The area referred to in-house as The Hill has another social 
climber. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a culture shock," Butler said of the transition from Californian to New 
Yorker, shaking his head in amazement and smiling at all the attention. "I'd 
grown up in L.A. and then I went to Stanford, and for me that was cold. 
</P>
<P>
"In L.A., everyone's so laid back. Here, it's like a different world. One of my 
first days I was walking along the street and some guy bumped me real hard. I 
was ready to turn and say something to him, but then it happened again. I 
realized it must be an every-day occurance." 
</P>
<P>
He has adjusted, though. Unlike the team he helped beat Sunday, albeit a minor 
contribution, he is succeeding away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quintin Dailey scored 26 points to lead the Clippers, who had no one with more 
than 9 rebounds or 5 assists. . . . Tests will be run Tuesday to determine the 
extent of Danny Manning's injured right knee. . . . Center Benoit Benjamin met 
with his agent, Larry Fleisher, Sunday afternoon but said no decision was made 
whether he should re-sign with the Clippers after this season. Fleisher has 
said he would like Benjamin to play elsewhere after becoming a free agent 
because "I don't think the chemistry is working." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman hit only 2-of-18 shots from the field, missing mostly from the 
outside, after going 5 for 14 against Indiana. "Basically, I really want Ken's 
game to start down at the low post," Coach Gene Shue said. "That's where I want 
him to get it started. When his shots are not falling from the outside, it's 
like he wants to prove he can do it." . . . The Knicks are 13-1 at home, the 
lone loss coming Nov. 22 against the Lakers.

BEAR BLITZ ONLY PUTS PRESSURE ON CORNERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day when it mattered most, the Chicago Bears forgot the answer to their 
very own pop quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Question: What's green and white and freezes all over? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Soldier Field's field. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, don't mention that to Bear coaches, who, according to cornerback 
Vestee Jackson, may have experienced some brain lock of their own in Sunday's 
National Football Conference Championship game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
The miscalculation, suggested Jackson, figured heavily in the 49ers' 28-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's point was this: Rather than remember The Frozen Rule (Grass turns to 
granite when the wind chill drops the temperature to minus-26 degrees), Bear 
coaches pretended they were on the shores of Maui, not Lake Michigan. They 
ordered blitzes when they should have been playing it safe. They ignored the 
elements, and by doing so, left Jackson and the rest of the Bear secondary ice 
skating their way to tundra trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Mike Richardson found himself alone with 49er wide receiver Jerry 
Rice as the Bears blitzed late in the first quarter. Moments later, the 49ers 
had a 7-0 lead, courtesy of a 61-yard touchdown reception by Rice. 
</P>
<P>
A fluke, Bear coaches must have thought, because midway through the second 
period, they called for another blitz, this time leaving Jackson with the job 
of guarding Rice one-on-one. Venture a guess on the outcome? 
</P>
<P>
That's correct: 49ers 14, Blitzes 0. 
</P>
<P>
And that was that. In no time at all, the 49ers and veteran quarterback Joe 
Montana proved that frozen fields are the great unequalizer. The 49er receivers 
knew where they were going -- and adjusted accordingly -- while Bear defenders 
didn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like playing on ice," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse was the Bears' insistence of leaving Rice to roam with but 
a single defender assigned to him. For whatever reasons, someone forgot to 
inform the coaches of the unsure footing. 
</P>
<P>
"We blitzed on both of (Rice's touchdowns)," Jackson said. "It was tough. The 
coaches don't know how the field is. They don't know (how) the field conditions 
are at the time." 
</P>
<P>
So, were blitzes the answer? 
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't think so," Jackson said. "When you've got conditions like 
that . . . we're at an even greater disadvantage at that point. It's hard for 
the coaches to know exactly what we're feeling out there on the field and what 
the conditions were today. But the coaches make the call and we're out there to 
play and execute." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, defensive coordinator Vince Tobin spent the game on the 
sidelines, where 29-m.p.h. winds swept across the field, where snow flurries 
occasionally appeared, where any person with an eye for ice could see that 
traction was a rumor -- especially for backpedaling cornerbacks and safeties. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin thought otherwise. Must have. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a banner day for Bear decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Every element, even something as simple as shoe selection, worked against the 
Bears Sunday. At game's beginning, the Soldier Field turf was still soft, the 
result of a protective covering kept on it for days. But halfway through the 
second period, the field was as giving as the Soldier Field parking lot. 
Players bounced when they hit the ground. And cleats, especially the metal ones 
that many of the Bears had chosen to wear, slipped and slid on the frozen 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the game, (the field) was great," free safety Todd Krumm 
said. "Then the area around the sidelines started to get rock hard. By 
halftime, there were patches all over the field where it had frozen up." 
</P>
<P>
Krumm said he hit the skids while trying to help Richardson on Rice's first 
touchdown catch. Instead of tackling Rice, Krumm skated past him. 
</P>
<P>
"Rice just made a great catch," Krumm said. "It was like he almost had a sense 
that I was coming. If he wouldn't have moved and just stayed there an extra 
second, maybe I would have been able to get better footing. But (Richardson and 
I) were both going full speed and, well, when he made his move. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the Bears, Krumm couldn't quite believe that the 49ers, of all 
teams, had overcome the bitter cold. This was supposed to be Bear weather. 
Instead, the Bears froze and the 49ers kept lighting more bulbs on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always told, 'You play under any conditions,' " he said. "But today was 
a little bit out of the ordinary. Maybe we thought that a team coming from the 
West Coast, that it would make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't, of course. Montana passed as if it were balmy, not near-blizzard 
weather. Rice danced across the turf as if he knew where every ice patch was 
located. 
</P>
<P>
"(Montana) waited, he was patient, he deserved to win," said linebacker Ron 
Rivera. "The pass rush was there, but Montana did an excellent job. He just 
stepped up and avoided the pass rush. He held the ball. He was courageous." 
</P>
<P>
As for Rice, strong safety Dave Duerson offered this observation: "There were 
only a couple of plays that Jerry made, but they cost us. We really couldn't 
afford to give them anything." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bears had a case of cold feet. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed us," said Duerson. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had help. They had those Bear coaches.

This seemed to be the principal difference between the two winners of Sunday's 
Super Bowl semifinals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cincinnati Bengals had a hard time putting Buffalo away even after 
injuries to All-Pro end Bruce Smith and other defensive stars took the Bills 
out of the game. Leading by 4 points at the half, Cincinnati needed a goal-line 
penalty in the third quarter to win, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Francisco 49ers, leading by 11 points after the first 30 minutes 
here in biting, 17-degree temperature, drove 78 yards after the second-half 
kickoff to put the Bears away by a score that eventually reached 28-3. 
</P>
<P>
At Cincinnati, the Bengals hung in and won. You have to give them some credit 
for that. On icy Soldier Field, the 49ers knocked the home team out. That was 
more impressive -- a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Joe Montana, the 49er quarterback, and Jerry Rice, his greatly gifted 
flanker, made this winter wonderland look like a California beach. 
</P>
<P>
Transcending the elements on a day when the wind-chill factor was minus-26 
degrees, the firm of Montana and Rice could hardly have played more 
artistically anywhere -- particularly on the game-winning touchdown plays of 
the 14-3 first half. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Bengals labored at home against a Buffalo team crippled by 
injuries to five of its six best defensive players -- Smith, Shane Conlan, Mark 
Kelso, Ray Bentley and Derrick Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is that Super Bowl XXIII in Miami Jan. 22 will be a replay of 
Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich., where the 49ers turned back the Bengals, 
26-21. 
</P>
<P>
On the five plays that broke Bear Coach Mike Ditka's heart, Montana passed to 
Rice for 133 yards in front of a hardy but disappointed crowd of 64,830. 
</P>
<P>
This was the Montana of his first two Super Bowls, in each of which he was the 
most valuable player -- before he hurt his back. 
</P>
<P>
He has now come, as he said, all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
People who haven't had serious back problems can't relate, perhaps, to the fear 
that has plagued Montana most of the time since his operation nearly 3 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he has played well, by the standards of other quarterbacks, he 
hasn't played as well as he thought he should until lately. 
</P>
<P>
In football, fear is a mighty neutralizer, and Montana, understandably, was in 
what could be called a slump. 
</P>
<P>
He has now been hit often enough to dispel his fears. He no longer worries 
about the back. He is now the old Montana again. 
</P>
<P>
As for Jerry Rice, he's the one who makes the Montana-Rice combination a 
contender for the National Football League's best of all time. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of NFL history, Rice is a different kind of receiver. He doesn't have 
the go-away speed of Hall of Famers Elroy Hirsch and Lance Alworth. Nor is he 
the quickest receiver of even his own time. 
</P>
<P>
But his huge hands make him a threat in any kind of weather, most noticeably 
sub-zero, chill-factor weather. And his explosiveness, whenever he feels it's 
time to accelerate, makes him unique. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable quality in a receiver is the ability to explode through the 
cushion," 49er Coach Bill Walsh said. "And that's what Jerry has." 
</P>
<P>
The cushion, in a coach's vocabulary, is the yardage that a good cornerback 
likes to keep between himself and a good receiver -- 3 to 7 yards, depending on 
the circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
On Rice's winning plays Sunday, he exploded through the cushions of, first, 
Bear cornerback Mike Richardson, then cornerback Vestee Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the touchdowns, and the victory, came easily. 
</P>
<P>
In this era of parity, what makes the 49er coach a bigger winner than Ditka or 
any other NFL rival in the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
One answer is that Walsh takes a very big view of football. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is best known for his creativity, he doesn't lose himself in X's 
and O's. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a modern administrator. He knows how to build a sound organization 
in a highly competitive field. He relates positively to his players. And he 
controls every aspect of the 49er show, from the draft to defensive philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
What is his defensive philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
Play tough. 
</P>
<P>
One example of Walsh football was on view almost every time that halfback Roger 
Craig or fullback Tom Rathman headed toward the Bears in a stadium where they 
gained a combined 104 yards. 
</P>
<P>
They were usually running the old Green Bay power sweep, the play that used to 
be a Vince Lombardi lecture topic through an 8-hour day at football clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Lombardi often talked exclusively on this play for 4 hours before lunch, and 
another 4 hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh reasons that if it was good enough for all that, it must still be an 
effective weapon. 
</P>
<P>
But as it happens, the 49ers are the only NFL team with this play still in 
their game plans. Not even Green Bay runs it anymore. Except for Walsh, NFL 
coaches all agree that power sweeps won't work against modern linebacking. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, who probably ranks with Walsh and Washington's Joe Gibbs today in the 
NFL's top three, had his team ready this time. But the Bears didn't play with 
the intensity they used to show before Ditka's heart attack 3 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
His sideline outbursts once made the Bears froth. They didn't have that frenzy 
Sunday. Ditka may have to find another way.

BARBER CHIPS IN ON 18TH FOR A 1-STROKE VICTORY

<P>
There was nothing mysterious about Mr. X Sunday at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen, Miller Barber, known as the mysterious Mr. X in his younger 
days, was celebrating the most astonishing victory in a career that began 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Barber, needing to chip and then 1-putt from the high grass above the 18th 
green to force a playoff in the Senior Division of the MONY Tournament of 
Champions, did better than even he expected. 
</P>
<P>
He rolled in the 50-foot chip to win the tournament and spoil Dale Douglass' 
tremendous comeback. Douglass, who led the tournament for the first 2 rounds, 
went into the final round of the 72-hole event in third place, trailing the 
leading Barber by 6 shots. After 6 holes Sunday, Douglass was 7 shots back and 
hoping for second, a familiar position for him. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Douglass got hot. He birdied 7 of the next 11 holes, taking the lead with 
a 20-foot birdie putt on 17. 
</P>
<P>
But the 18th made the difference. In the 3 previous rounds, Douglass hooked his 
drive on the 406-yard, par-4 final hole. Making sure he didn't go left, 
Douglass hit the ball so far right it landed in the fairway of the 18th on an 
adjacent course. 
</P>
<P>
He still had an opening to the green, but pushed a 4-wood to the right in the 
high grass and was left with an uphill approach. His chip rolled down the hill, 
about 10 feet below the hole and his putt lipped out. The bogey gave him a 67 
for the round and seemed to make him at least a cinch to be in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Barber, playing just behind Douglass, was in the low rough on the left with his 
drive. He used a 2-iron for his 195-yard approach. It was a flier, bouncing 
through the green about 4 feet into the rough. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a downhill shot and I was just trying to get in a playoff. It was 
moving so slowly, I didn't think it would get to the hole," Barber said. "My 
caddie yelled, 'My God, it's going in.' I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Douglass was sitting in the scorer's tent, watching to see if there would be a 
playoff. As Barber, hobbled by a painful right foot, was trying to jump in 
jubilation, Douglass walked out to confront Barber. In mock anger, he threw 
down his visor, then threw his arm around Barber. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything negative about this," said Douglass, who finished second 
in 5 tournaments in 1987 when he didn't qualify for this tournament. "It was 
Miller's tournament. I just feel fortunate to have been in a position where I 
could have won." 
</P>
<P>
Douglass earned $30,000, the winner's share last year. It was Barber's 25th 
Senior Tour title, one less than the leader, Don January. 
</P>
<P>
Barber, who will play in the Bob Hope Classic this week and then have his foot 
examined for a possible bone spur on his right heel, finished with an 8-under 
280 total, including a par 72 on the last round. He earned $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although the chip won it for Barber, a marvelous par on 12 enabled him to get 
in position. 
</P>
<P>
He 3-putted the 10th and, unknown to him, Douglass was 4-under and surging. 
Barber hooked his drive on the 521-yard, par-5 12th, and it hit the picket 
fence that serves as the course boundary. The ball came to rest in the high 
rough, just inches from the fence. There were 2 choices. He could either try to 
hit the ball left-handed or he could hit it right-handed back toward the tee. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a ruling that the ball was playable, Barber knocked it out in the 
fairway, but 70 yards farther from the green than he was after his drive. A 
solid 3-wood still left him about 150 yards away. His 8-iron approach put him 
12 feet beyond the flag. He made the downhill putt to save par. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really getting tired out there," said Barber, who will be 58 in March. 
"The foot was bothering me so much that I had to use a cart. It started hurting 
all of a sudden (a tournament) in Puerto Rico in mid-December. It feels just 
like the left one did before the surgery to remove a bone spur. 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought I was comfortably ahead, so I wasn't too concerned. About 14 I 
found out Douglass was closing ground in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this ranked with his greatest victories, he answered, "Oh, yes. I've 
chipped in before just like everyone else, but never to come from behind and 
win a tournament. This is one of our biggest tournaments, so that's special, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Barber said that when Douglass came up to him, he said, "Great shot, man, great 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he shot a fantastic round on this course," Barber added. "I don't 
believe you'll see any better golf from anyone on a course like this. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I'm going to do some celebrating before I join the young boys at the 
Hope." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing missing from his triumph was that he didn't beat all the "boys." 
When Steve Jones finished later at 279 to win the open division, he beat Barber 
by a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, although the greens were frozen early in the day, was the best day, a 
contrast from a year ago when rain and high winds wiped out the final round. 
Dave Hill, the winner last year, never threatened in this one, shooting 292. 
Arnold Palmer did worse -- 300, 12 over par. He still had the largest gallery 
of any senior.

Roger Clemens will reject a $6 million offer from the Boston Red Sox, his agent 
said, but hopes to remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't intend to accept that proposal," Randy Hendricks said of the 
$6.3-million offer for 3 years. Clemens, a two-time Cy Young Award winner with 
62 victories the last 3 seasons, made $1.35 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks is believed to be asking $8 million for 3 years. If Clemens does not 
sign by Jan. 16, he can file for arbitration.

LEGAL-AID PROJECT FOR POOR: NEEDY BUT NEAR REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For attorney Kathy Forbath, it is "the sort of work you dream about when you're 
in law school." 
</P>
<P>
Her vision was of an organization that would use the courts to fight for the 
rights of those who traditionally are denied legal services -- the poor and the 
working poor. It would be a law firm made up almost entirely of attorneys 
volunteering their time to help those unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
In a county with a population of more than 2 million -- and about 7,400 lawyers 
-- it seemed like a modest proposal. But Forbath found, as others before her 
had, that in Orange County it is not easy to raise money and attract volunteer 
attorneys for public-interest law. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three years after Forbath and a group of like-minded people launched the 
project, Orange County Public Interest Law Advocates is nearing reality, with 
some 30 lawyers having indicated an interest in volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
Only about $50,000 has been raised so far to finance the project -- about 20% 
of the founding group's original goal -- but the people involved have decided 
to proceed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We scaled back our vision," said Forbath, a 29-year-old business law 
practitioner. "We knew it would take a long time to raise the (extra) money. If 
we waited until we had the public-interest law firm we dream of, we might never 
start." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues of Wide Scope 
</P>
<P>
Public-interest litigation, sometimes called "impact" litigation, generally 
involves issues of a wide scope, affecting the rights or welfare of many 
people. An example is a lawsuit brought several years ago by the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County after lawyers with that organization noticed an 
unusual provision of Social Security regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A divorced person who remarried jeopardized his or her right to receive Social 
Security benefits upon the death of the former spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"The divorced spouse could claim the benefits only if the spouse died before 
remarriage," recalled Legal Aid director Bob Cohen. "The effect was people 
would be afraid to remarry because they were afraid they'd lose their Social 
Security." 
</P>
<P>
The topic was perfect for public-interest litigation. The victims of the policy 
came to Legal Aid for help; the rule was not mandated by federal law but by 
bureaucrats, and rather than carrying on many separate legal fights to resolve 
the issue, it was felt that it could be best resolved through a wider case. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Legal Aid prevailed in a decision that overturned the regulation 
and affected the rights of all Social Security recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Society has been involved in other public-interest cases in 
Orange County. Last year it challenged a Santa Ana policy of confiscating 
possessions of the homeless and forced the county to hike its general relief 
payments. The group also has pushed unsuccessfully for affordable housing in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
195,000 Poor in County 
</P>
<P>
But Legal Aid's real mission is providing direct legal services for individuals 
in need. Some 195,000 people in Orange County who are under the poverty line or 
near it qualify for help. 
</P>
<P>
And it lacks the funding to expand far beyond that role. A $3-million budget 
covers operations in all of Orange County as well as Southeast Los Angeles. 
During the last 8 years, the Reagan Administration has fought to eliminate all 
funding for Legal Aid, and federal budget-cutting measures left the local group 
$200,000 in the red last year and facing the possibility of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We see 15,000 people a year," Cohen said. "With our budget, if you take a few 
impact cases and litigate them hard you've exhausted the organization's budget. 
There can't be too much impact work -- otherwise we'd need to severely reduce 
services." 
</P>
<P>
As for the immediate mission of Public Interest Law Advocates, Forbath said she 
expects health care and housing will be early focuses of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen percent of our residents get no medical treatment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the system doesn't work as it's designed to do, someone has to point that 
problem out," Forbath said. "That's what impact litigation does. You raise the 
flag and say, 'Hey, Orange County, you're not following the law.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Legal Aid Groups 
</P>
<P>
There are other groups in addition to Legal Aid already providing free legal 
assistance in Orange County, but they have limited roles and are operating 
under their own financial constraints. 
</P>
<P>
* Amicus Publico matches volunteer attorneys with needy individuals who have 
been referred to it, often by Legal Aid. It serves about 600 people a year but 
lacked the resources to initiate public-interest litigation. 
</P>
<P>
* The American Civil Liberties Union has been involved in well publicized cases 
challenging conditions at the Orange County Jail and Juvenile Hall. ACLU 
lawyers also had a hand in stopping seizures of the belongings of the homeless, 
have challenged the county's policy of checking the criminal records of welfare 
applicants and have taken on several AIDS discrimination cases and one high 
school newspaper censorship case. 
</P>
<P>
Groups such as Legal Aid and Amicus Publico are often restricted by artificial 
definitions of need in determining who is eligible for their services, 
according to Elliot Block, staff counsel for the Fair Housing Council of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous middle ground of people who are also affected who aren't 
quite that poor but are clearly not in a position to sue on their own," Block 
said. "That has always been a problem. They could only take impact cases where 
they could find a client who earns this tiny amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen estimates that his agency serves only 20% of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
The need for more accessible legal assistance is apparent in figures compiled 
by the State Bar of California and the American Bar Assn. According to Ann 
Wassam, a State Bar official involved in promoting pro bono work, about 3 
million Californians are living on incomes below the poverty line. The American 
Bar Assn. estimates that about 23% of these people will need legal help in any 
given year. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, a fund financed with part of the interest on money in trust 
accounts that lawyers hold for clients has provided support for legal services 
for the poor in California. Some $16 million was distributed last year. Part of 
that money went to 19 different legal assistance groups in Los Angeles -- and 
only two in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Extrapolating from available statistics, every lawyer working for groups 
supported by the trust has 1,437 potential clients each year, according to 
Wassam. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the figure is more than double, or about 3,504. 
</P>
<P>
"For any impact litigation cases that have been done in Orange County, we've 
basically had to go begging to one of the Los Angeles public-interest firms," 
Block said. "It's a disadvantage. Lots of things don't get done. You end up 
taking 6 months or a year to get their attention." 
</P>
<P>
For Forbath and the fledgling Orange County Public Interest Law Advocates, with 
the $50,000 raised so far, what is needed to survive is simple: money and 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy has undertaken a major challenge," Block said. "(The $50,000) might be 
sufficient for seed money, but she's going to need some ongoing support to keep 
it going year to year. And that's very hard to come by in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers say their profession is experiencing a national downward drift in 
the willingness of practitioners to volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people sense the decrease in voluntarism is because of the trend of 
looking at the law as a business rather than a profession," said the bar's 
Wassam. "With all the emphasis on the bottom line and billable hours (office 
time lawyers can charge to clients), that sometimes discourages attorneys from 
doing pro bono work. With the business theme growing, the professional theme is 
diminished -- the idea that this is a profession with a high calling." 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Bar Assn., an estimated 10% of all lawyers involve 
themselves in providing legal services -- or pro bono work. Available 
statistics show far lower participation in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A State Bar survey indicates that 11% of all attorneys volunteer services in 
San Diego County. In Orange County, with about the same number of lawyers, only 
4% volunteer. While the figures are not exact -- and the State Bar plans a 
major survey this year of pro bono work -- the study shows Orange County 
lagging. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the same type of volunteer spirit in Orange County that we do in 
other parts of the state," Wassam said. 
</P>
<P>
While others involved in providing legal services for the underprivileged agree 
with that assessment, one who does not is Orange County Bar Assn. President 
Michael Gazin. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of community responsibility," Gazin said. "The lawyers I know 
have it. It's important to me and to the association. I don't think our county 
is in any way less of a participant in pro bono than other counties." 
</P>
<P>
Some 310 lawyers now volunteer for Amicus Publico, according to its executive 
director, Deborah Fabricant, who acknowledges the number is low. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of attorneys out there who are interested in doing volunteer 
work," Fabricant said. "The key is just in making them aware of how fundamental 
the problems of the poor are. In terms of financial support, it's the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The nearest parallel to Fabricant's organization in Los Angeles is Public 
Counsel, a group created and funded in part by the Los Angeles County and 
Beverly Hills Bar assns., with 3,500 volunteers and a $1.1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Among other cases, the group has filed lawsuits alleging that the county has 
failed to properly monitor abused and neglected children, challenged municipal 
ordinances limiting day care and attacked what it asserts are incompetent 
Immigration and Naturalization Service translators at deportation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say generally that you don't need a lot of people to promote the idea of 
pro bono," said Public Counsel executive director Steven Nissen. "You need a 
small number of well placed people initially to encourage the idea. The basic 
instinct of most practicing lawyers is to want to contribute and do some of 
this work. If the economic and social climate of the law firm promotes it, the 
great majority of practitioners will do the work." 
</P>
<P>
Gazin predicted that Forbath's group "can and will" succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed that a lot of large firms have been very interested in getting 
lawyers in the firm involved in pro bono work. It may be easier for the large 
firms to afford that luxury, rather than sole practitioners who have to worry 
about paying the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainties of the future, Orange County Public Interest 
Advocates has so far received a warm welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it definitely filling a need," said Sister Annette Debs, of the Sisters 
of St. Joseph of Carondelet, who has run a unique community law center in 
downtown Santa Ana for 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Most agencies serving real people don't have the resources to take the next 
step beyond the one-person cases. I think that is the importance of their 
effort."

CAMBODIAN KILLING FEARS RETURN IN COUNTY'S REFUGEE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It is yet another anniversary steeped in agony. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago this week, when Vietnamese occupation troops drove the murderous 
Khmer Rouge Communists from power, Oudam Roeung and Kheng Bou -- like millions 
of other Cambodian survivors -- wanted to hope. 
</P>
<P>
When the Vietnamese tanks came to Kampong Thom province on Jan. 6, 1979, 
Roeung, then a boy of 17, was spending his fourth year in a forced labor camp, 
smashing boulders into rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"We just throw our hammer, our material, away," he said. "We thought we had our 
freedom. We think that anything that come up will be better than what we have 
now." 
</P>
<P>
And on Jan. 14, Bou, a prominent gynecologist in the capital of Phnom Penh 
forced to work in the rice fields, joined a desperate throng in Pursat province 
rushing toward the latest of Cambodia's "saviors." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone say it was Russians," he said. "Others say it was Americans. I don't 
know what troop it was. When I run from the Khmer Rouge to the liberation camp, 
the so-called liberation camp, I say, 'Oh, Vietnamese again.' What can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
For many among Southern California's estimated 70,000 Cambodian refugees -- the 
third-highest concentration of Cambodians in the world, behind Phnom Penh and 
the Thai refugee camps -- the pain of surviving what millions of their 
countrymen did not is overbearing. It fades, sometimes, in the realization that 
they live, but more often it clutches at their hearts and seizes their souls. 
</P>
<P>
The dates scorched in the memories of Bou and millions of other Cambodians mark 
shifts in the political strategies of the Chinese, the Soviets and the 
Americans. But the waves of human suffering that those policies produced seem 
to lap, one into the next, with no precise beginning and still no end. 
</P>
<P>
This year may mark yet another political milestone in the tortured history of 
the Southeast Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas are at an estimated strength of 
35,000 fighters and are by far the most powerful of the nation's domestic 
political factions. In a climate of warming Sino-Soviet relations, complicated 
and delicate strategies for a new coalition government in Cambodia -- which 
would include the Khmer Rouge -- have not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the Vietnamese are planning to continue their withdrawal from 
the country, the strength of the Khmer Rouge stirs terror in the hearts of 
Cambodians who fear that their country will again be turned into the killing 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of memory, a foggy mind filled with so many things," said Sovan 
Un, who was an elementary-school teacher before the revolutionary Khmer Rouge 
overpowered the U.S.-backed government on April 17, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a lot of family killed," said Un, who now lives in Anaheim. "My father 
killed. My brother killed. . . . And not everybody was killed with a knife or 
with a gun. People were swollen, malnourished. I watched people die while they 
were trying to eat." 
</P>
<P>
"I am very depressed," said Bou, a diminutive man of 56 who abandoned his 
medical career when he escaped to Thailand in May, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Cambodian is depressed," he said. "We were depressed under (Khmer Rouge 
leader) Pol Pot, the Vietnamese, then the (Thai refugee) camps and now, here. 
We have what we call the culture shock. We have a different way to live and 
here, everything is changed." 
</P>
<P>
Bou, who spent more than 2 years in a refugee camp before arriving in Long 
Beach in 1984, now lives in Paramount with his wife and six of his nine 
children. Two have been unable to leave Cambodia, and a third lives in France. 
</P>
<P>
Bou works as a counselor at the Santa Ana office of United Cambodian Community 
Inc., a refugee service organization established in 1977 in Long Beach, where 
most of Southern California's Cambodian population lives. About 12,000 to 
15,000 Cambodians live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
What the center aims to do, workers there said, is give Cambodian refugees 
guidance and hope in a nation so strikingly different from their own. 
</P>
<P>
But what not even the most expert counseling can erase, they conceded, are the 
scars born of living through hell. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview at the Santa Ana service office with a group of 
diverse Cambodian refugees, the survivors credited their faith, their guile or 
their fate with keeping them alive from the time of the 1975 Khmer Rouge 
takeover to their arrival in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them, they said, was "lucky." 
</P>
<P>
For the week preceding the takeover, San Tran recalled, she and other residents 
of Phnom Penh were forced to stay home from work because of the heavy bombing. 
At the time, Tran, who was born in Vietnam, worked as a telephone operator at 
the Finance Ministry and as a radio newscaster. She lived with her three 
daughters and other female relatives. Her husband was away at sea in the 
merchant marine. 
</P>
<P>
But early in the morning of April 17, 1975, when the Khmer Rouge marched on the 
capital, Tran and the other Phnom Penh residents allowed themselves to believe 
in yet another savior. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that peace had come to Cambodia," said Tran, 45. "I put a white 
sheet in front of the house. I didn't know they were killing us." 
</P>
<P>
Roeung, who was a 14-year-old high school student at the time, added that he, 
as the others, believed the Khmer Rouge when they said that everybody must 
temporarily evacuate their homes so that they could "clean out" the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of happy," he said, "because I thought (the fighting) was over. My 
brother and I got on a motorcycle and waved a white sheet. For a few days, we 
were having fun. It was like camping. We thought they would let us back into 
our homes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the entire population of Phnom Penh was marched into the countryside, 
and all other urban centers were evacuated. Most government employees, 
professionals and other educated people were killed. Those who were not killed 
either managed to escape in those early, confused days or successfully hid 
their upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killing 'Knowledgeable People' 
</P>
<P>
"I had a problem," Tran said. "I showed them that I worked at the finance 
ministry. But I escaped. I had some jewelry and a watch, and the Pol Pot 
(forces) exchanged it for some rice. I cry and cry. I just want to kill myself. 
I just walk and walk. We just like animals." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Tran said, she changed her name and erased her past. 
</P>
<P>
"I forgot everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Un, at the time an unmarried, 25-year-old teacher in the western border town of 
Pailin, said he escaped the area after overhearing a group of Khmer Rouge 
commanders discussing their plans to kill "all the knowledgeable people." 
</P>
<P>
But months later, after arriving in Battambang province and lying about his 
identity, death again threatened to overtake Un when Khmer Rouge soldiers 
challenged him while he was out gathering wood for another group of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing there in the hole that they made me dig," he said of what was 
to have been his own grave. "But then the other soldiers arrived and told them 
that they knew me." 
</P>
<P>
Then on June 31, 1977, Un said, the Khmer Rouge accused him and a friend of 
talking against the Communist regime. Both were taken to an execution area, 
their arms tied over their heads to the trunk of a tree, and for eight hours, 
they were terrorized by soldiers brandishing a knife and hitting their heads 
with a rifle butt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Just Kept Praying' 
</P>
<P>
"I weighed only about 60 pounds," Un said. "I was swollen, malnourished. I keep 
praying. I told them I work hard. I just kept praying." 
</P>
<P>
Why the soldiers did not kill him, Un said, is something that he has no words 
to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"What you would call it," he said, "is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Un, who escaped to Thailand in November, 1979, with the woman who was to become 
his wife, now lives in Anaheim and has two children, ages 5 and 7, who were 
born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His American children, he said, cannot yet understand the pain of survival that 
he and his wife carry with them. But he said they will learn to understand 
about the Khmer Rouge, about communism and about the lies of false saviors. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the Vietnamese and Pol Pot," Bou added, "is like the 
difference between cholera and the plague. Pol Pot, he kill, but quickly. The 
Vietnamese, they kill you slowly."

MISSING SKIER RESCUED AFTER SUB-FREEZING NIGHT IN SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A skier from Orange who got lost near a San Gabriel Mountains resort was found 
in good condition Sunday after spending the night in a remote, snowy gulch with 
nothing but his clothing and a piece of bark to protect him from sub-freezing 
temperatures, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ensminger, 23, was "cold and hungry" but otherwise "perfectly OK" when he 
was rescued by a helicopter crew about 10:30 a.m. Sunday, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's alive, he's in great shape, he's not even hypothermic," said a relieved 
Steve Cramer, manager of the Mountain High ski area near Wrightwood. "He's a 
very lucky man." 
</P>
<P>
Ensminger became separated from friends while skiing with them Saturday 
afternoon. When he failed to return to the base of the mountain at the end of 
the day, members of the local ski patrol began looking for him and, when they 
were unable to locate him, called in search and rescue teams from the Antelope 
Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Three helicopters and 34 rescuers from surrounding jurisdictions aided the 
search. But no trace of Ensminger could be found until Sunday morning, when 
rescuers found ski tracks on the back side of the mountain that ended at the 
site of an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
At first, rescuers feared that Ensminger might have been swept up in a wave of 
sliding snow. In fact, he had skied through the area before the avalanche 
occurred, and a helicopter crew spotted him about 10:45 a.m. in Bear Gulch, 
about five miles from the ski area, Sheriff's Deputy Bob Nimtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers rappelled down the mountain, and Ensminger was airlifted to safety. He 
was examined by paramedics but did not require medical treatment, Nimtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Ensminger told rescuers that he took a wrong turn on the mountain Saturday 
afternoon and became disoriented, then tried to find a way out and stopped when 
it got dark, Nimtz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid was smart," said Sheriff's Deputy Ronald Thomason from the Antelope 
Valley station. "He dug out a little depression in the snow with a piece of 
tree bark and got under a bush, out of the wind." 
</P>
<P>
With the wind-chill factor, temperatures in the area dropped to 35 degrees 
below zero Saturday night, Thomason said.

NOTEBOOK: COOPER'S FOCUS SHIFTS TO SPECIALS BUT CONTENT STILL ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Jim Cooper defied the TV odds. 
</P>
<P>
In a business in which success means making it to a second season, Cooper's 
weekly public affairs program was aired on Orange County's KOCE-TV for nearly 
17 years. It won two Los Angeles-area Emmys and for years was the only TV news 
program dedicated entirely to exploring Orange County issues. 
</P>
<P>
But "Jim Cooper's Orange County" is no more. 
</P>
<P>
Ending the show was a mutual decision by Cooper and station officials at KOCE, 
Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly half a century as a journalist, first in print and later as radio 
and TV broadcaster, Cooper wanted to spend more time at home in Santa Ana, he 
said recently. And KOCE executive Bill Furniss said the station, still strongly 
committed to news programming, wanted to shift its format in the direction of 
longer shows, to delve more deeply into issues. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is by no means disappearing from the airwaves, however. He expects to 
produce and be host for a series of 90-minute specials on KOCE in the coming 
year. The first, to air Jan. 25, is about the county's shortage of adequate 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
"When I worked as a reporter for CBS, we had a minute, maybe a minute and half 
to tell a story," said Cooper, referring to the 6 years he worked as the county 
reporter for the CBS-TV affiliate in Los Angeles. "Now I'm going to get 90 
minutes. . . . That's quite a change." 
</P>
<P>
In a market dominated by Los Angeles-based TV stations, which for years treated 
Orange County like a distant land, Cooper focused KOCE's cameras on local 
issues, ranging from housing and transportation to drug abuse and acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
There was little razzle or dazzle, however. His was not the Geraldo Rivera 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been a big fan of fluff," said Cooper, a Midwesterner and former 
Marine Corps aviator who settled in the county in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
What has most surprised Cooper about the county through the years is its 
"intellectual and cultural" growth, he said. Much like a teen-ager, the county 
grew in all directions, but questions persisted about the level of 
sophistication of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cooper said, the county no longer plays second fiddle to anyone, least 
of all Los Angeles: "We've lost the days when you could smell orange blossoms 
from the beach to the mountains. But the county has evolved into a more diverse 
society. . . . The change has been breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who has taped close to 1,000 shows, acknowledged a strong affection for 
the county but quickly added that he is "not blinded by its promise. There are 
problems here." 
</P>
<P>
Solutions to the county's ills were long debated by politicians on Cooper's 
shows. During election years, Cooper was host for question-and-answer programs 
with county candidates running for state and congressional offices. In an age 
when opposing candidates often avoid each other on the campaign trail, Cooper's 
show offered one of the few forums where opponents met face to face. Though 
Cooper was criticized at times for being too soft on his guests, voters at 
least got the chance to see and hear the candidates speak. 
</P>
<P>
Few candidates have declined his invitation to appear on the show. Cooper 
estimated that 95% of those invited have shown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at 67, Cooper hopes to be host for another round of election programs in 
1990. He made it clear that he has no intention of sitting idle, even though 
his show is now gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got too much energy to sit still," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for Orange County.

POSTSCRIPT: ATTACK NOT LIKE IN MOVIES, AISSA WAYNE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her father, John Wayne, had confronted scores of killers and had defeated each 
one with tough, red-white-and-blue defiance. 
</P>
<P>
But that had been in movies. The killers that his daughter Aissa faced last 
October were real ones, professionals who made her understand the reality of 
predator and prey. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they are certain the two men were contract killers who were after 
her companion, Roger Luby, a 52-year-old real estate millionaire. Luby was 
going through a divorce, a bankruptcy and a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against 
a syndicate of lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The men had called Luby by name as he and Wayne got out of a car at Luby's 
Newport Beach estate last October. One methodically bound and beat Luby, 
slashed one of his Achilles tendons and tried to cut the other. 
</P>
<P>
But the other man turned on Wayne, gashing her face and holding her, bound and 
face down, with a gun at the back of her head. 
</P>
<P>
She thought he was going to pull the trigger. "I kept thinking, 'I'm only 32, 
I'm only 32.' It wasn't fear. It was shock and disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing like the hundreds of "hits" depicted in movies and on TV. "It 
was so fast, so abrupt. They knew what they were doing. It wasn't like there 
was a chance to fight." 
</P>
<P>
According to Luby's and Wayne's account of the attack, the men were parked in a 
pickup in front of Luby's walled estate on 22nd Street west of Irvine Avenue. 
They looked like construction workers, and since there was considerable 
construction going on in the neighborhood, neither Luby nor Wayne paid them any 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
As Wayne pulled the car through the electrically operated front gate and into 
the open garage, the two men walked through the open gate and amiably 
approached Luby as he got out the passenger side. 
</P>
<P>
One asked, "Are you Roger Luby?" As soon as Luby answered yes, the man drew a 
handgun and struck Luby in the head with it, knocking him down. The other man 
grabbed Wayne, bashed her forehead against the garage pavement opening a large 
cut, bound her hands behind her and held a gun to her head. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wayne and Luby remarked later at how quietly the scene unfolded. The 
attackers said hardly anything. The victims were submissive, hoping it would 
save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It was complete shock," Wayne said. "When all of a sudden you turn around and 
there it is, there are no choices. The only thing we had to do was keep our 
wits about us and just hope whatever they were going to do they'd get 
accomplished and we could remain alive." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers the feel of the blood gushing from her wound. "It was warm. I 
don't know why that shocked me." 
</P>
<P>
And she remembers that when she heard one of the men ask how to close the 
garage door, she thought they were going to kill both Luby and herself. "I 
thought, 'They're closing the door so no one can see.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said it was odd that she felt no panic. Instead, she felt a strange 
calmness, perhaps the same that prey feels when it is in the jaws and no longer 
has hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you would call it resignation. There's something that takes over. Up to 
that time, I felt hope. Then it was just calm. I think when you're tied up like 
that and can feel the gun at the back of your head, there's just not much you 
can do. It keeps you sane for those last few seconds, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
She said her resignation to death lasted about 15 seconds, until Luby told her, 
"They're leaving." They had closed the garage door behind them and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The fear came the following day, Wayne said. Despite the presence of 
bodyguards, police and friends, despite new security systems, "I didn't leave 
the house for several days. Finally, I just forced myself. The first time 
getting in a car and going someplace was hard. I did it one step at a time: Go 
out, come back, go out a little farther, come back." The fear decreased a 
little every day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 14 weeks after the attack, "I'm still scared" but "I'm pretty much over 
being frightened every single day and looking over my shoulder and all that," 
she said. "I'm not really in fear. Time really does heal." 
</P>
<P>
It has healed the gash her attacker left over her right eyebrow. The scar is 
invisible except to close inspection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, she said, time also will heal her relationship with Luby, with whom 
she has been "very, very close" for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger's in a different position. His children are grown. Mine are young." 
(Wayne has two children -- 7-year-old Jennifer and 5-year-old Nicholas -- from 
her first marriage and is undergoing a protracted and bitter court battle to 
gain custody of her 1-year-old daughter, Anastasia, from her second marriage.) 
</P>
<P>
"You think of your kids more than yourself. You can't put them in jeopardy. 
There's somebody out there who doesn't like either Roger or me, and probably 
both of us are worried that we don't want to get in that situation again. We 
have to see what happens." Now she sees Luby only "occasionally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When or if the police find out what happened, that can clear up a lot of 
things. But when there's a mystery out there and you burn your finger in the 
fire, you don't go back to the fire unless you know it's out." 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally, she's scarred probably a bit more than I am," Luby said in a 
separate interview. "It's a tough one. 'Your friends did it or my friends did 
it?' It's that kind of thing. I'd be less than candid if I said it didn't 
affect our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Luby said he, too, did not feel fear until the day after the attack. But unlike 
Wayne's fear, his increased every day, making it more difficult to face the 
outside world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But things are on the mend, Luby said. His attacker did not entirely sever his 
Achilles tendon, making it easier to repair. Luby, an avid tennis player, is 
out of his cast now and walking confidently. Over the weekend he took his first 
careful swings at a tennis ball. There is still numbness of the right heel and 
ankle, but his surgeon predicts "at least 95% recovery," Luby said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is no longer fearful, only watchful. An upgraded security system, a 
handgun and good marksmanship learned during his Air Force service make him 
feel reasonably secure at home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not feel the need to carry a gun away from the house, he said. 
"First, they won't give you a permit, and second, you may get excited and 
perceive danger where there isn't any and really hurt somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatric counseling has helped a lot, he said. Yet, a distant car door 
closing still has an ominous sound to it, and when he comes home and finds a 
pickup truck parked on the street, "I mean, you watch real carefully." 
</P>
<P>
His pending divorce and his suit against a group of lenders who, he alleges, 
reneged on their obligations and sent him into bankruptcy have taken more of a 
toll on his mental health than the hit men did, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that same lawsuit should be resolved this year and restore his fortunes, he 
said. He will be wealthy again, "there's no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the attack, Luby announced that his friends had pledged a total of 
$100,000 as a reward for leading police to his attackers. Luby said that once 
his fortune is restored, he'll pay the reward himself. He expects to spend the 
money, because he has confidence that police will eventually arrest whoever is 
responsible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But police expressed less confidence. "We don't have anything right now," said 
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Bob Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked into a lot of personal stuff. We looked carefully at Aissa's divorce 
and child-custody thing and the relationship (to the attack), but best we could 
find out, there was no relation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a large number of possibilities (on Luby's side). Anybody would 
be upset over bankruptcy. So many possibilities, but none have panned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll ever know who they were unless somebody slips up and says 
something." 
</P>

GEORGETOWN'S ALONZO MOURNING STILL HAS A LOT OF LEARNING TO DO 
</P>

<P>
Sometimes, it is difficult to remember: Alonzo Mourning is just a college 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't talk like a college freshman. He doesn't act like a college 
freshman. And he certainly doesn't play basketball like a college freshman. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it took him exactly three games to accomplish two things Patrick 
Ewing did not manage during four seasons at Georgetown. In the Hoyas' 95-62 
victory over St. Leo on Dec. 7, the 6-foot 10-inch center from Chesapeake, Va., 
scored 11 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The "triple-double" was the first by a Georgetown player since John Thompson 
became the school's coach in 1972. And the 11 blocks exceeded by one Ewing's 
single-game school record. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with his collegiate career at the ripe old age of 10 games, Mourning is 
averaging 13.3 points on 63.5% field-goal shooting, 7.6 rebounds and 6 blocked 
shots per game. In contests against De Paul and 10th-ranked Seton Hall, he 
averaged 18.5 points on 64.7% field-goal shooting, 8 rebounds and 8 blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind Alonzo Mourning is just a freshman -- although one with 
talents far beyond his 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I played my first game of college basketball, I knew that people would 
expect a lot from me," he said Friday in one of his first extended interviews 
since being permitted by Georgetown to speak with the media Jan. 1. "But I had 
to take that under consideration because I know that I'm human, and I know that 
I'm not going to go out and score, like, 50 points every game. But that's the 
way they perceived it to be in some of the magazines. They perceived me to be 
the big man on campus and all that. 
</P>
<P>
"They fail to realize that I'm still a freshman, and all freshmen have to go 
through that learning experience and they have to adjust to college basketball 
and adjust to playing against that much talent every night. You have to adjust 
to going to school and also to playing with your teammates. You have to 
conserve your time, like getting the right amount of rest and eating the right 
foods and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like that" might be Mourning's only concession to teen-agerdom. He says 
that when he was invited to try out for the Olympic team, "It was kind of 
shocking to me." But what happened after that was anything but. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if they didn't know that I had the talent to make the Olympic team, I 
would have never gotten the invitation," he said. "So anything I did shouldn't 
have been a surprise to me. They saw the talent in me and they just wanted to 
see more of it. I came out and just did what I had to do in the situations I 
was in." 
</P>
<P>
And of Thompson's decision not to bring him to Seoul? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was right -- I know he was right -- because I'm a freshman and I 
didn't really need to miss my first semester of school for basketball. 
Basketball is going to be there, regardless. The Olympics aren't going 
anywhere; they happen every four years. So, in '92 they'll still be there and 
hopefully I'll still be playing ball." 
</P>
<P>
He says he feels "just like any other student on campus" and "nobody on campus 
treats me any differently." He likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want them to treat me any differently. I hope they will look at me 
as a student instead of as a big-time basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he does not pretend. He knows that, in addition to being a student, he is 
a big-time basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mourning: "I wouldn't call it a burden. I know if Coach puts me in that 
position, that's where your maturity comes in. You have to learn to adjust to 
that situation, If you're in crunch time and the ball has to get inside, you 
have to know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
More accurately, you have to have learned what to do with it. And Mourning has 
learned from some of the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying out for the Olympics and playing against all that talent while being 
the youngest player out there really molded me to the point where I was ready," 
he said. "I was comfortable in the college atmosphere I was in, so I didn't 
really have to all of sudden adjust to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just by playing against that talent, I learned. So, when different situations 
happened to me in college, I was pretty much comfortable with them because I 
had been through them already." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning seems to have gained something more than just basketball knowledge 
from Ewing. He seems to have gained a sense of what it means to be in a 
position similar to Ewing's. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning said, "I can't do poorly in my schoolwork. Just wearing that jersey is 
a big honor." 
</P>
<P>
That jersey is No. 33, the one Ewing wore at Georgetown. Mourning said he began 
wearing No. 33 as a junior-varsity player in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I started liking Georgetown when they played North Carolina (in the NCAA 
final), when Patrick was a freshman," Mourning explained. "I like Kareem 
(Abdul-Jabbar), too. In junior high, I wore No. 6 because I liked Dr. J (Julius 
Erving)." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Ewing "is not really why I took the No. 33, but it fits somewhere 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
"It was great what Patrick did," Mourning said, "but it's going to be hard to 
follow in Patrick's footsteps because he's done so much for Georgetown. That's 
why I have to make my own path and do something different from what he did."

AMERICAN S&amp;L'S STAFF CHEERS OLD, NEW TEAM AT TOP

<P>
A preppy-looking tycoon from Ft. Worth named Robert Muse Bass came to the 
fairgrounds in this San Joaquin Valley town of 190,000 this weekend and 
received a welcome normally accorded royalty or rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
Bass, a bashful sort who rarely ventures into the public spotlight, was all 
smiles as he was mobbed by adoring employes of American Savings who clamored to 
get his autograph and take his picture. "Thank you for helping us survive," one 
employee after another told him. 
</P>
<P>
The outpouring of affection came after the 40-year-old Bass finally sealed a 
deal on Dec. 28 to buy American Savings, which has been a financial mess since 
1984 because of huge losses and repeated deposit runs. Employees had been 
haunted for years with the possibility that American Savings might be closed or 
carved up. 
</P>
<P>
Bass, a billionaire and corporate acquisition specialist, raised $350 million 
in new capital for American Savings and pledged to raise an additional $150 
million in the new three years. In return, party goers gave him a toaster, the 
traditional gift from a thrift when a depositor opens a new account, and a 
T-shirt saying: "American Independence Day: 12/28/88." 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the new era, Bass threw parties at locations around the state in 
places like Stockton, Oakland, Anaheim and Woodland Hills. The parties were 
linked together with live satellite broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for this party for four years," said Layna Browdy, 
American Savings' chief public relations official during most of the turmoil. 
Browdy arranged the party, but declined to say what it cost. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration was especially festive here, where the dignitaries gathered. 
American Savings is headquartered in Stockton, located about 60 miles east of 
Oakland, and employs nearly a third of its 5,300 workers here. American Savings 
is also Stockton's largest private employer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All Positive' 
</P>
<P>
The party had the ambiance of a 1950s pep rally and sock hop, all designed to 
dovetail with American Savings' new advertising theme that it now operates by 
old-fashioned standards of service and strength. 
</P>
<P>
In case anyone did not get the nostalgia message, Frankie Avalon -- actor, 
singer and 1950s teen-age heart throb -- acted as party host and general 
cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
The party included repeated standing ovations for Bass, warm tributes to 
William J. Popejoy, who ran the company during the tough times, and a pep talk 
by the new boss, Mario J. Antoci. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate negative thinking," Antoci, who replaced Popejoy as chief executive 
late last month, said. "From this point on, it's all positive." 
</P>
<P>
The only discordant note came from Roger Martin, the federal banking regulator 
who spearheaded a grueling, monthslong regulatory effort to find a buyer for 
American Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Martin took the occasion to take a jab at William Crawford, the California 
savings and loan commissioner who refused to help with the federal effort to 
sell American Savings to Bass. "I hope you notice that we didn't invite 
commissioner Crawford," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The party amounted to a last hurrah for Popejoy, who is going into business 
with Bass and will remain a director at American Savings. Wearing saddle shoes, 
blue jeans and a high school-style letter sweater, Popejoy was also surrounded 
by well-wishers who wanted his autograph and photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Although many outsiders -- financial analysts, competitors, regulators -- did 
not hold Popejoy in especially high regard, inside the company he was a popular 
and good-humored figure who seldom let discouragement show. 
</P>
<P>
When introduced to the crowd, the 50-year-old Popejoy got an ovation that 
equaled the one accorded Bass. "Thank you," he cracked. "That was well 
deserved."

FARMING THE NEW POWER OF LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
DESERT FIRM GENERATES 95% OF THE WORLD'S SOLAR ENERGY 
</P>

<P>
Falling oil prices have cast a pall on large-scale solar energy production 
projects nearly everywhere but here in the Mojave Desert, where a Los Angeles 
firm just doubled its power output to 196 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
The Luz International Ltd. system, which began in 1983 with a 14-megawatt solar 
energy generating plant in the nearby community of Dagget, now has seven "solar 
farms" that use 650,000 parabolic mirrors to convert sunlight into enough 
electricity to power more than 100,000 homes. Two of those "solar farms" were 
started in late December. 
</P>
<P>
Luz, which has a permanent work force of 250 people ranging from computer 
processors to mirror washers, operates the largest commercial solar energy 
plant in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We represent 95% of the world's production of solar power right here at Luz," 
said Walter Smith, a vice president. He said the company "takes its name from a 
place in Israel where Jacob had a dream of building a ladder linking heaven and 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
The way Smith sees it, the privately held company is poised to take advantage 
of an inevitable oil shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"We are assuming that oil won't be $15 a barrel for the rest of our lives," 
Smith said. "Obviously, the higher the price of oil, the more attractive 
becomes alternative sources of energy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creating Superheated Steam 
</P>
<P>
Luz's solar fields, which were built on 1,000 acres of desert with $750 million 
raised from private and utility investors, consist of arrays of curved mirrors 
that individually track the sun with microprocessors and light-sensing 
instruments, Smith said. Each mirror focuses the sun's light onto a steel pipe 
mounted inside a vacuum-insulated glass tube. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the pipe is a synthetic oil that is heated to 735 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The oil flows through a heat exchanger, generating superheated steam for a 
traditional turbine generator. 
</P>
<P>
All the electricity produced by the system is being purchased by Southern 
California Edison Co., which distributes it to households and businesses 
throughout Southern California, a spokesman for the utility said. 
</P>
<P>
William von KleinSmid, supervising engineer at Edison, acknowledged that Luz's 
196 megawatts of power barely add up to 1% of the utility's peak demand load of 
20,000 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, "I've got to give them credit for what they've done out there," 
von KleinSmid said. "A lot of people thought they couldn't build those plants." 
</P>
<P>
Luz's first solar energy plant in Dagget is situated a few hundred feet away 
from an experimental 10-megawatt plant that Edison built in 1982, primarily 
with U.S. Department of Energy funds at a cost of $141 million. That plant, 
which used 21,816 mirrors to direct the sun's rays to a giant boiler atop a 
300-foot-high tower, was shut down late last year after operating as a research 
project for six years. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't economic to operate it without subsidized funding," von KleinSmid 
said of Edison's solar plant, which local residents had dubbed "steam on a 
stick." 
</P>
<P>
The Luz technology is based on one of three dominant forms of solar energy 
production in use today throughout the world, according to Scott Sklar, 
president of the Solar Energy Industries Assn., a lobbying group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Plant Planned 
</P>
<P>
Most common is the solar panel, which is often fixed on or near a house to heat 
water. Still in the embryonic stage of commercial development are 
photovoltaics, which use specially treated silicon wafers to generate 
electricity on contact with sunlight. Photovoltaics are used to produce power 
on some satellites, Sklar said. 
</P>
<P>
Chronar Corp. of Princeton, N.J., is awaiting final approval to begin 
construction of a $125-million, 50-megawatt photovoltaic plant in Lancaster. In 
a telephone interview, Chronar founder Zoltan J. Kiss said the plant, which 
would be seven times larger than any existing photovoltaic plant, could be 
completed by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Luz's success amid a current oil glut and proliferation of independent gas-fire 
generators is connected to its lucrative 30-year power contracts with Edison, 
and its track record, according to Mike Henderson, an engineer with the 
consulting firm of R. W. Beck &amp; Associates of Denver, Colo., which recently 
completed a review of Luz's solar projects for its investors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied to Oil Rates 
</P>
<P>
Paul Savoldelli, a spokesman for the company, said investors are getting a 13% 
to 14% return on their investment after taxes. Luz had revenue in 1988 of $155 
million, Savoldelli said, compared to $108 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"Luz's contracts for solar plants 1 through 7 are tied to fixed-cost 
projections (for oil), which they got when their power sales contracts were 
signed with Edison back in 1985," Henderson said. At that time, projections for 
oil prices were significantly higher than they are today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials emphasized, however, that all its future power plants will be 
built on contracts based on going market rates for oil. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, of the half dozen solar power plants I have reviewed over the 
past five years, Luz is the pre-eminent in terms of performance and installed 
capacity," Henderson said. "I can't think of anyone else around the world with 
more than 10 or 20 megawatts." 
</P>
<P>
"Luz built a better mousetrap," agreed Charles R. Imbrecht, chairman of the 
California Energy Commission. "We believe they have produced what is today 
clearly the most efficient solar thermal electric generation system in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Meyer, adviser to the president of the California Public Utility 
Commission, said although "you really have to stretch to find fault with these 
guys," the company has the ability to produce nearly 25% of its electricity 
from gas-fire boilers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are allowed to do that under federal regulations, and some people 
complain that is cheating," Meyer said. "To me that is not cheating, since they 
are still producing 75% of their power from solar sources and that's pretty 
damn good." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Myer said that Luz provides most of its power output during those 
hours when Edison needs it most, for example, the middle of summer when air 
conditioners are running throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smith cautioned that "we'll never replace nuclear power, gas and coal, 
but we will have a market niche where we will be competitive with oil prices." 
</P>
<P>
Luz plans to triple its energy production over the next five years by building 
four 80-megawatt plants and one 60-megawatt plant at the Kramer Junction site 
where five of its solar fields are. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1993, we will be producing an additional 400 megawatts of power," Smith 
said, "which will be a third of the power produced at the San Onofre Nuclear 
Power Plant." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Luz hopes to build similar plants in Sunbelt states such as New 
Mexico and Arizona, as well as in countries including India, Spain and Israel, 
where the company's research laboratory was founded in 1979, Smith said.

SONG PUBLISHERS CALL THE TUNE IN A SELLER'S MARKET;

CATALOGUES ARE NOW HOT COMMODITIES; THE TAKEOVER FRENZY HAS SOME WORRIED

In the entertainment industry, music publishing used to be considered the plain 
little sister of the more glamorous movie, TV, record and video businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore, however. Spurred on by increased record sales, higher song royalty 
rates and licensing fees, and an explosion of music-consuming cable and 
satellite TV programming overseas, music publishing has suddenly become one of 
the hottest commodities in show business. In fact, some think the song market 
is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
Recent acquisitions of music publishing catalogues have totaled more than $1 
billion, according to some estimates. Last week alone, Sony Corp.'s CBS Records 
unit paid about $40 million for Nashville-based country music publisher Tree 
International, and the British entertainment conglomerate Thorn-EMI agreed to 
purchase the 250,000-song catalogue of SBK Entertainment World for an 
unprecedented $337 million. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the inflationary spiral, SBK Entertainment bought nearly all 
of its song catalogue in 1986 from CBS Records' former owner, CBS Inc., for 
$125 million -- a price that many thought was high at the time. Some experts 
said the same thing last year, when Warner Bros. Music purchased Chappell &amp; 
Co., with its estimated 400,000-song catalogue, for a reported $225 million to 
$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Now people are saying it again about Thorn-EMI; everybody's got a new number 
to criticize," said Jay Morgenstern, executive vice president of 
Warner-Chappell Music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally a seller's market right now," said Chuck Kaye, who was president 
of Warner Bros. Music at the time of the Chappell takeover and later quit to 
form his own Burbank-based publishing company, Windswept Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this coming," Kaye said. "When I saw what was being paid for Chappell, I 
said, 'I have to get a piece of this; I want to be in on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
With financing from a Japanese telecommunications firm, Fuji-Sankei Group, 
Kaye's Windswept recently acquired New York-based Big Seven Music, whose 
6,000-song catalogue includes such 1950s and 1960s pop hits as "Why Do Fools 
Fall in Love," "I Think We're Alone Now" and "Mony, Mony." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assets 'Undervalued' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the economics finally caught up with the business," Kaye said. "And I 
just got in under the wire." 
</P>
<P>
A music publisher owns or oversees song copyrights, licensing them for use in 
television, movies, advertising and other commercial contexts. The publisher 
collects the fees and royalties from the various uses of its songs, generally 
splitting the proceeds with the songwriter or copyright owner. 
</P>
<P>
According to Edward P. Murphy, president of the National Music Publishers 
Assn., the high prices being paid for song catalogues are not unwarranted. "I 
think these assets have been undervalued for some time in relationship to 
earnings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased royalties paid to music publishers by record companies 
-- which have seen their unit sales rise at an annual rate of nearly 20% in the 
past few years -- "the amount of music being used in TV commercials has 
increased, at very high fees," Murphy said. "The price range for a song used on 
a national commercial is now $200,000 and on up." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign income for music publishers "is going up between 30% and 
40% a year," Murphy said. "As a result of all the expansion in Europe -- cable 
TV, satellite TV, free TV, the BBC's addition of new channels -- they are using 
music over there at a higher rate all of a sudden. The amount of music being 
consumed is tremendous -- also in South America and other emerging nations. The 
demand for Anglo-American repertoire is just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
"Software is king in the entertainment business, and music is just another form 
of entertainment software," said Fred Anschel, an analyst for the New York 
investment firm of Dean Witter Reynolds. "What they are getting is their pound 
of flesh for all the new uses of music, all the new TV channels." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easier Than Drilling 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst for the Los Angeles investment firm of Crowell, 
Weedon &amp; Co., said he sees an analogy between what's happening in the music 
publishing business and the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easier to buy reserves than to drill," he said. "And song 
copyrights are reserves. They're an annuity whose value can go up ten- or a 
hundredfold." 
</P>
<P>
Logsdon offered an extreme example of the current frenzy to acquire song 
copyrights: 
</P>
<P>
"We recently saw a deal involving a two-artist company with a negative net 
worth and major lawsuit against them that they are going to lose. And 50% of 
that company is being bought for $4 million -- with only seven song titles in 
copyright." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of the recent acquisition binge has been a marked consolidation in 
the industry. The four largest firms of just four years ago -- Warner Bros. 
Music, Chappell &amp; Co., EMI Music and CBS Songs -- have been reduced to two 
huge firms, holding close to 1 million copyrights between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's good for the business or not," said Chuck Kaye. "It's 
made a lot of people wealthy and put lot of copyrights in a couple of corporate 
pockets, but those big companies can't dictate the economic policy of the 
industry because royalty rates are dictated by the government and tribunals. 
They cannot set economic standards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Pork Bellies' 
</P>
<P>
Some in the industry are concerned about the buying and selling frenzy. "It's a 
little bit reactionary; I see song catalogues being passed around like poker 
chips," said Lance Freed, president of Los Angeles-based Almo Irving Music. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a set multiple for buying a song -- four to eight times its 
annual net publisher earnings," said Freed. "But now they're becoming 
commodities like pork bellies or gold, where the value is what people are are 
willing to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that, despite all this insanity and the focusing on the bottom 
line that will result from these huge prices being paid, the business stays 
somewhat creative." 
</P>
<P>
"We think the premiums being paid right now are extreme," said Nicholas Firth, 
president of BMG Music Publishing Group in New York. "People are investing 
right, left and center, and a lot of these purchases are being made based on a 
very bullish scenario. It's like the leveraged buyout game -- one thing feeds 
on another." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Irwin Z. Robinson, president of EMI Music Publishing Worldwide, 
still thinks his company is getting a bargain in its $337-million purchase of 
SBK Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"A very good copyright lawyer, Lee Eastman, who is also Paul McCartney's 
father-in-law, once said to me, 'Irwin, when you buy a copyright that has a 
track record, you can almost never overpay for it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I've pretty much lived by that ever since," Robinson said.

Lower seasonal demand, a drop in wholesale costs and heightened retail sales 
competition combined to push gasoline prices down a full cent in the first week 
of the new year, an oil industry analyst said. The national average price of a 
gallon of gasoline was 98.04 cents, a cent lower than the price Dec. 16, said 
Trilby Lundberg, whose Lundberg Letter regularly surveys pump prices at 13,000 
service stations across the country. Prices at self-serve stations, where most 
gasoline is sold, averaged 87.81 cents for regular unleaded, 104.08 cents for 
premium unleaded and 84.41 cents for regular leaded. At full-service stations, 
prices averaged 118.24 cents for regular unleaded, 129.69 for premium unleaded 
and 114.78 for regular leaded.

India will seek extradition of former Union Carbide Corp. Chairman Warren 
Anderson in the Bhopal gas case, a government prosecutor said. U.S. Prasad told 
a Bhopal court that arrest warrants issued in November for Anderson and two 
other Carbide officials had not been served because of U.S. and Hong Kong legal 
restrictions. The U.S. Justice Department said an arrest warrant that specified 
automatic $1,000 bail for Anderson was not covered by U.S. laws on 
international judicial assistance. A warrant could not be served on Union 
Carbide Asst. Secretary John Macdonald or on Peter Wintle, a senior official of 
Union Carbide Eastern, for the same reason, Prasad said. All three have been 
charged in a criminal suit over the 1984 disaster, in which more than 3,000 
people died. Meanwhile, the Indian judge who awarded $270 million in interim 
compensation to the victims of the Bhopal gas disaster was formally replaced. 
After an October High Court judgment upholding the contention of Union Carbide 
Corp. that Judge M. W. Deo had shown bias in making the interim award, the case 
was handed over to Judge Shamboo Singh.

A critical round of contract talks between Eastern Airlines and its Machinists 
union could collapse early this week after the abrupt departure of the union's 
chief negotiator, officials involved in the talks said. Bill Sheri, who acted 
as union spokesman in sessions Friday and Saturday in Key Largo, Fla., left the 
talks without explanation Sunday. Further negotiations were scheduled for 
today, but sources said Eastern may drop out of the talks early this week if 
they are not satisfied with the union's explanation for Sheri's hasty 
departure.

HIGH-OCTANE AUTO SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBITIONS' 'GLITTER' STILL RELIES ON SEX APPEAL TO ADD FLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just inside the doors at the Long Beach International Auto Show, the crowd 
murmurs about classic beauty and sleek lines as a platform revolves slowly in 
front of them. 
</P>
<P>
Displayed on the stage are a racy 1989 Ford Thunderbird and an actress named 
Bridget Hoffman. Compliments are divided between the car and Hoffman, who is 
describing the car. 
</P>
<P>
Women may be buying more cars these days. But auto shows still smack of boys' 
night out. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers can't stop trying to add sizzle to the exhibits with attractive 
women, some of whom would look more at home in a Las Vegas chorus line than 
describing a turbocharger. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet offers a gaudily clad "Heartbeat of America" dance team. Toyota's 
models -- the female ones -- are known for revealing costumes. 
</P>
<P>
At the Dodge exhibit in Long Beach, Carrie Hall wears a spangled silver gown to 
promote a car named for a soap opera. A few feet away, Rene Lovern of Van Nuys 
sits behind the wheel of a four-door Dodge Shadow. She barely notices Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the glitter that comes along with any show," she says. "I'm a 
single parent looking for a car. I don't really even see that other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Lovern reflects a trend at auto shows. More women are going, not as adjuncts to 
a husband or boyfriend, but to buy. Show organizers estimate thatwomen make up 
a third of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are buying their own cars and having a say in what the family car will 
be," said Barry Greenberg, an organizer of the Long Beach show. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers have been slow to respond, but some efforts are afoot to reflect 
the times. 
</P>
<P>
"I make a conscious effort to be available to women for questions and 
comments," said Hoffman, who has worked at auto shows for four years. "Women 
are paying more attention and asking more serious questions." 
</P>
<P>
Some car makers have toned down the women's outfits. Hoffman's Ford-supplied 
"uniform" is a black suit that could double as business attire -- if the 
sequins were taken off the lapels. 
</P>
<P>
Since Carrie Hall started working car shows 10 years ago to pay for college, 
the role has evolved into more than glitter. "We're no longer just hood 
ornaments," said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The women, called "narrators," are usually models or actresses. They sign a 
contract with an auto maker for a season and earn up to $3,500 a show, 
depending on experience and show length. 
</P>
<P>
Their spiel comes from a script written by the auto company and approved by its 
lawyers. The women memorize five or six scripts a season, so they can move from 
car to car at different shows. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman lives in Los Angeles and mixes three or four auto shows a year with an 
acting career. She may soon break out of the narrator ranks, however; she has a 
lead role opposite Ned Beatty in an upcoming film, "The Time Trackers." 
</P>
<P>
The women are paid to be pleasant for six-hour shifts. They soon discover that 
smiling so long makes their faces ache, especially when some men have more in 
mind than kicking the tires. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring you stuffed animals or hang around all day," said Hoffman. "You 
learn to be persistently polite. And you throw away a lot of business cards at 
the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the narrators have heard every line imaginable. Hall and 
Hoffman are contemplating a book about their experiences. The tentative title 
is the most oft-asked question on the auto show circuit, "Do you come with the 
car?"

<P>
Vandalism is something no one in the auto show industry likes to discuss. Most 
show officials claim there are no problems at their shows, but some are quick 
to point out problems at rival exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The most costly vandalism usually involves slashing leather seats of luxury 
cars. More frequent targets are in-dash cigarette lighters and gearshift knobs. 
A Ford official said an entire audio system was taken from a car once. 
Enterprising thieves also have made off with car batteries and engine parts, 
which is one reason the manufacturers keep the hoods locked. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago a few years ago, a man climbed into a Lincoln Continental, locked 
the doors and began shouting, "It's mine." It took three hours to find a 
locksmith to open the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles auto show is hoping to attract new attention this year by 
showcasing winners of the National Automobile Model Design contest, billed as 
the nation's largest gathering of futuristic automotive styling. About 30 of 
the winning scale models are on display in the convention center lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lost one claim to fame to Detroit this year. Traditionally, Motor 
Trend magazine has announced its domestic car of the year in Los Angeles during 
the show. This year, however, the winner of the award was unveiled at a 
luncheon on Thursday in Detroit in conjunction with the show there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a coup for Detroit and increases the prestige of the Detroit show 
to have the announcement there," said Jack R. Nerad, executive editor of the 
Los Angeles-based magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Show revenue comes from ticket sales and space rentals. Ticket prices range 
from $7 in some East Coast cities to as little as $1 at some small regional 
shows. They average $4 or $5; the Los Angeles show is $4 for adults and 
children under 12 are free. 
</P>
<P>
Car manufacturers rent exhibit space, and prices vary widely, even among the 
big shows. Exhibitors at the Detroit show this week are paying $2.50 a square 
foot, while those at the Los Angeles show pay $4 and Chicago will charge $5 in 
February.

'CLOUDS HAVE DISAPPEARED'; JAPAN'S MARKETS EXPECTED TO REGAIN STEAM

Japan's financial markets, overshadowed for months by uncertainty about Emperor 
Hirohito's health, are expected to rise this week after his death Saturday, 
dealers and traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"The psychological clouds hanging over the markets for months have now 
disappeared," said a stock analyst at a major securities house. 
</P>
<P>
The markets have been restrained in recent months on fears of sudden declines 
after the emperor's death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's stock, bond and commodity markets were closed for their half-day 
sessions Saturday, but will open for business as usual today along with the 
foreign exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
Most stock traders said institutional investors may temporarily refrain from 
active trades out of respect for the late emperor. 
</P>
<P>
Some brokers suggested last week that the Tokyo market's 225-share Nikkei 
index, which hit a record high of 30,397.51 last Thursday, could fall about 300 
points after Hirohito's death. 
</P>
<P>
But after a brief decline in stock prices, the market should rally and rise to 
new highs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am more than 100% sure that the market indicator will soon renew its highs 
to celebrate the new era," a trader at another brokerage said. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the emperor should boost profits for paper-related companies, 
because of the printing of fresh calenders bearing the name of the new imperial 
era, which could help their shares. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the emperor's death will have little impact on 
currency trading in Tokyo today. 
</P>
<P>
"Market operators are not likely to be active on Monday out of respect for the 
late emperor, but trading will not be especially limited," one dealer said.

ANOTHER FUN FIRM IN ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
ODETICS 'ASSOCIATES' WHO PLAY TOGETHER STAY TOGETHER

In the 1984 book "The 100 Best Companies to Work For in America," two Orange 
County businesses on opposite sides of Harbor Boulevard in Anaheim were among 
the elite. 
</P>
<P>
One was Disneyland. The other was Odetics. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, of course, needs no introduction. 
</P>
<P>
But most people haven't heard of Odetics Inc., a small high-technology company 
founded in 1969. Nor could they probably name its co-founder and chairman, Joel 
Slutzky. 
</P>
<P>
Even among high-tech companies, which have a reputation for stressing 
"quality-of-life" factors, Odetics is a bit of an oddball. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics has a Fun Committee that meets occasionally to plan ways for employees 
to, well, have fun. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the Los Angeles Lakers' National Basketball Assn. title last year, 
the Fun Committee planned "Lakers Day," during which anyone who came to work 
dressed in the team's colors was entitled to a free lunch in the company 
cafeteria. In years past, the committee also devised "Project Girth," where for 
every pound lost by an employee, the company donated $1 to his or her favorite 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics also has its own repertory theater company, which stages performances 
every few years. The last performance was "You Can't Take It With You" in the 
spring of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The company's lobby is furnished with, among other things, footstools in the 
shape of human feet. In 1982, the company opened its Odexercise Center, which 
has an indoor heated pool and an exercise room that most health spas would be 
proud of. The facility offers aerobic dance classes and a health training 
program, and has a full-time fitness coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to Odetics than just fun, however. 
</P>
<P>
The company manufactures sophisticated space recorders that are carried on 
board the space shuttle and satellites, time-lapse videocassette recorders that 
are used in banks and convenience stores, and computerized cart machines used 
by television stations to automate their programming. Odetics also built a 
six-legged robot named Odex, which is now exhibited at the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Odetics earned $896,938 on revenue of $49.7 million for its fiscal year ended 
March 31, 1988. For the 6 months ended Sept. 30, the firm earned $633,000 on 
revenue of $25.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Slutzky, 49, was one of six Odetics co-founders. He earned undergraduate 
degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of 
Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where he also was awarded a master's degree in 
mechanical engineering. He lives in Newport Beach with his wife Judy and their 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Times staff writer David Olmos, Slutzky discussed 
his company, his management philosophy and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. One of your company slogans is: "Odetics: not just another company." What 
does that slogan mean to you? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it reflects a philosophy that is geared to a balance between the 
present and the future. We don't take the traditional price-earnings, the 'What 
did you do this quarter?' approach. We try to balance our short-term 
performance with where we see the long term. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Odetics is in the business of developing intelligent machines. What is an 
intelligent machine? 
</P>
<P>
A. Intelligent machines are machines that adapt to their environment. It's 
really a very broad term for the field of robotics. The original term robotics 
was picked up by manufacturing industry and was used for stationary robots used 
for welding or painting. In order to differentiate traditional robots from the 
factory robots, the industry coined the expression intelligent machines. 
Intelligent machines can run the gamut from artificial intelligence capability 
to machines that have sophisticated electronics and can do tasks that simpler 
machines can't do. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of intelligent machines do you see your company making in the 
future? 
</P>
<P>
A. We've defined four market areas: space, defense, nuclear and commercial 
applications. In the area of space we're very much interested in docking and 
berthing of satellites. Also service and maintenance of satellites. There are a 
number of applications for robots in the U.S. space station. We expect that 
there will be a number of platforms in space -- with electronic packages, power 
supplies and other equipment that will have to be replaced from time to time. 
The ability to have a servicing vehicle that can dock with the platform and 
change a bad component for a new one is important. I also think there are other 
areas, such as refueling in space or space construction, that will be a natural 
for robotics. In the area of defense, we've been concentrating on 
logistics-handling equipment (for example, a device attached to the end of a 
truck that could be used to pick up pallets of food or other military 
supplies). The third area is the nuclear industry. Our interest there is 
service and maintenance in nuclear power plants. We're currently building a 
robot for public utilities that would be used for doing routine maintenance in 
a nuclear plant, such as changing filters and turning valves. In the commercial 
area, which probably is the most fertile, we manufacture cart machines for the 
television industry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If I could ask you to do some star-gazing, what kinds of intelligent 
machines are we going to be seeing 10 to 15 years from now? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the trend is very clear. We're getting more sophisticated and 
smaller computers. These computers are allowing us to do more processing, 
quicker processing with more memory capability. We're also developing better 
sensors, which allows us to do many more things. In the area of defense, for 
instance, many of the philosophies and the equipment are geared for a historic 
perception of (combat). When you start looking at intelligent machines, you 
talk about eliminating people (from the task). And when you start talking about 
eliminating people, you start to rethink what that equipment should look like 
in a military scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some examples of that? 
</P>
<P>
A. A tank, for instance, looks like a tank because it's been designed to 
protect people. If you were to design a peopleless tank, an autonomous tank, it 
would look completely different. It wouldn't need the armor to protect the 
people. It would be very lightweight and very fast. It would be a very 
revolutionary-type thing. (Intelligent machines) are going to affect military 
philosophies and strategies. In commercial use, there are many tasks that are 
just impossible for human beings to do or for which they need tools that don't 
exist today. Intelligent machines will allow us to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Odetics has a reputation as a unique place to work. You have been quoted as 
saying that you try to create an environment of enjoyment for your employees. 
How did this get started? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, first of all we don't call them employees. We call them associates. I 
think everyone is a reflection of their experiences. When we started the 
company on Day 1, we talked about trying to establish a company where there 
were no "we's" and "they's," where it was more of an "us." We wanted to create 
a family-type atmosphere in which the associates would be the company. And we 
have found that to be very successful. We quickly realized that we weren't 
getting the type of turnover that other companies were getting, that there were 
real dividends in that philosophy, that we didn't have the recruiting and the 
training costs. So, if anything, it was selfish motivation that kept that 
philosophy alive. It just makes good sense, not only for Odetics but for any 
company to do that. Because you can't replace experienced people. And there's 
no substitute for people who really care about what they're doing. If they feel 
like they're a part of it then they financially end up caring about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is your turnover rate? 
</P>
<P>
A. In our space division, for instance, the average tenure of our associates is 
8 1/2 years. The turnover rate has been about 5% a year, which is extremely 
low. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But the swimming pool and the recreation facility cost money. Is there a 
payback? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. The cost of the facilities is really very small compared to the 
benefits. One benefit which is hard to put a dollar figure on is the 
communications and feedback that goes on in that kind of environment. You know, 
it's one thing to talk to somebody when you're wearing a suit and tie and 
they're wearing an assembly smock. You've already got a caste difference going 
in the discussion, which is going to bias some of the communication. It's 
another thing when you're both in your sweats and you're talking about what's 
going on in the company. It's a great reducer of barriers. So that's a benefit 
that you can't put a dollar figure on. There are other benefits which are more 
tangible -- the health and well-being and happiness of the people that are 
using those facilities. There are some real intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Of the tangibles, for example, do you find that people are not out sick as 
much? Have you studied the relationship there? 
</P>
<P>
A. We looked at it. And I think people are out sick less, but we might have 
more sprained ankles than other places. But it's more than the gym and the 
swimming pool. We have a number of tournaments. We have a Ping-Pong tournament, 
volleyball tournament, basketball tournament and corporate fitness cups. One 
has to appreciate how much time you spend in a company relative to the amount 
of time that you spend at home. If you take away the sleeping portion of the 
day, you actually spend more time at work than you do at home. So I've always 
felt that work should be interesting, challenging. You should want to get up in 
the morning. There's nothing worse than a static environment and a static set 
of conditions in working. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In a newspaper article a few years ago, your personnel manager at the time 
said that you are "as crazy as anybody gets." What did you think of that? 
</P>
<P>
A. My feeling about an article like that is that it's nice but that's not what 
we're all about. As far as my being crazy, when I looked at the article, I 
said, "I'm not crazy. If anything, I've lost too much of the child in me." But 
the more I thought about it, the less I took offense at it. I think that we all 
could use a little more child in us. Sometimes we get too serious and too hung 
up on what we're doing. The fact that every once in awhile you'll see something 
a little bit different here -- like at Easter you might see somebody running 
around in a bunny suit -- I think that's good. And if crazy means fostering 
that sort of thing or condoning it, then that's fine with me. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Although Odetics has been profitable for 18 consecutive years, your profit 
margins have not been as high as some other companies in your business. Is the 
company too busy having fun? 
</P>
<P>
A. The truth is that the amount of time you spend relaxing is very small and is 
necessary. When you have people that work hard and come in on Saturdays and 
sometimes on Sundays, they do that for a love of the company. When we make 
marginal profitability, it's because we've been putting our profits back into 
research and development. That has no reflection on the gym or the swimming 
pool. But people can draw their conclusion, and that's always a danger. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Has the image of Odetics as a fun place to work had any effect on how the 
company is perceived on Wall Street? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I think we're really not a Wall Street company because we've taken a 
long-term view, and Wall Street is very much quarterly conscious. We have opted 
to do some things that, in the short term, don't help. For instance, we 
purchased these facilities (Odetics' headquarters building in Anaheim, which 
the company bought in 1984). If you were trying to placate Wall Street, you 
wouldn't do that because you don't really want the depreciation on your books. 
Depreciation hurts earnings, which hurts the price of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It's been said that one of the advantages Japanese corporations have over 
their American counterparts is that they're more willing to take a long-term 
approach to their markets, exchanging short-term profits for market share. 
Would you agree with that? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that kind of spirit is something we see still in the Japanese 
market. I think the Japanese believe in market share and will do anything to 
establish market share. When you match that kind of a philosophy against a 
society that believes in earnings, then you have an imbalance. When the 
competition gets tough, the person who succeeds is the one who believes in 
market share, has a long-term outlook and is willing to wait out the situation. 
A person who believes in earnings is likely to throw in the towel and give up 
on an industry because it's not "earning enough." We've seen major American 
companies get out of a market because they didn't feel there was enough 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you think the Japanese have the right strategy? 
</P>
<P>
A. The Japanese have been very patient. They've come into industries and tried 
to understand what is required to make them a success. And then they're willing 
to invest the time and effort to do that. You have to admire that. There's an 
awful lot of Japan-bashing going around. But anybody who is close to the 
situation has to admire their tenacity, their persistence and their desire to 
learn and succeed. We've got to do the same thing. We certainly don't want to 
become the Great Britain of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of future growth do you see for Odetics? 
</P>
<P>
A. We would like to see it become a $100-million company within the next 4 to 5 
years. We're taking it one objective at a time. I think we have a number of 
opportunities for good growth. What we really want is . . . to let the company 
grow in a logical, harmonious way. If you go too fast, it provides 
dislocations. If you go too slow, you've got financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What would you consider logical growth? 
</P>
<P>
A. At a growth rate of 20% to 30% a year, there is still a comfort factor. If 
the growth gets larger than that, you've got people coming through the front 
door so quickly that there is no way you can impart philosophies -- to tell 
them what we're all about or we're trying to achieve. The secret of a 
successful company is getting everyone steering in the same direction. You do 
that not by dictate, but through dialogue and by discussing where you're going.

CRUZADOS AND RAVE-UPS: EQUALLY FLAWED OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop music certainly has its major and minor leagues and who ever wants to be 
called minor? In a shared bill at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on 
Friday, two long-enduring Los Angeles bands -- the Cruzados and the Rave-Ups -- 
displayed very different, though equally flawed, approaches to dealing with 
life in the bush leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Rave-Ups were considered one of the Southland's most likely 
bands but then were derailed by a lengthy legal wrangle with their former 
label. If the performance Friday was any indication, the band now is resigned 
to going unheard. 
</P>
<P>
Front man Jimmer Podrasky came on stage with an advantage most singers lack: a 
songbook with lyrics engagingly balanced between sharp detail, seasoned insight 
and self-deprecating humor, and music that draws from America's roots while 
avoiding its ruts. But for much of the 15-song set the quartet performed as if 
the audience had already left. Podrasky's listless vocals barely made it to the 
microphone, much less through an appalling sound mix, and the music was 
enlivened only by Timothy Jimenez's consistently propellant drumming and some 
occasionally involved country-rock solos from guitarist Terry Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Podrasky did start giving his songs their due near the set's end, putting 
feeling into "This House," a moving study of a grandmother's bereavement when 
her husband dies. And he put a matchbook's worth of fire into the signature 
"Rave-Up/Shut-Up." Had the group only opened the show with the passion it 
reserved for its encore numbers, the atmospheric "Radio" and a jumping 
arrangement of "Cotton Fields," the Rave-Ups could again be counted among Los 
Angeles' Next Big Things. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to Podrasky's generally resigned approach, the Cruzados' Tito 
Larriva seemed almost desperate to make major-league music, a desperation 
evident in the band's new musical style. When signed by a major label (Arista) 
a couple of years ago, the rough, individualistic sound the band had carried 
over from Larriva's punk-spawned Plugz was dropped in favor of out-of-focus, 
big-screen anthem rock. Now that Arista has dropped the band, Larriva has 
steered straight toward the lucrative metal sound. 
</P>
<P>
If Larriva's reason for changing styles is artistic rather than fiscal, it 
certainly wasn't evident in the new songs that dominated Friday's 13-song set. 
Abetted by new guitarist Jimmy Crespo (formerly with the post-Joe Perry 
Aerosmith), the foursome created an undistinguished crunchola sound located 
somewhere between AC/DC and Bon Jovi. 
</P>
<P>
The shame of it was that Larriva gave the dreck-ish songs everything he had, 
with hair-flinging stage moves and a vocal delivery equal parts the late Bon 
Scott of AC/DC, Jim Morrison and Yosemite Sam. His fiery charisma alone 
elevated the new songs: "Laugh It Off," a Stones-ish chord bash, and "The 
Strange Face of Love," an otherwise ridiculous delve into occult imagery. But 
only the Spanish language ballad "Flor de Mal" showed the emotive impact 
Larriva could achieve if unfettered by the pedestrian material that filled the 
rest of the set.

OWEN SKIPS JAZZ HERITAGE, BUT FANS LOVE HIM MADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MEROD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several months ago in San Diego, a high-profile panel discussion over the scope 
and meaning of the word jazz nearly came to hockey-style confrontations over 
use of the term to include a variety of formats that stand at odds to the 
blues, ballad and bop traditions at the heart of mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Saddleback College's McKinney Theater, that debate was still 
alive. Sandy Owen, a pianist of considerable talent, played before a sold-out 
audience deeply appreciative of his musical taste and skill. He was accompanied 
by Paul Carman on soprano and tenor saxophones and by Donna Thomas on 
percussion instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Owen's concert explored 17 compositions, all but one written by him. The night 
was divided among solo, duo and trio performances and shared its mellow outlook 
for a generous 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Owen showed himself to be an engaging conversationalist, with much of the charm 
of the event derived from his laid-back monologue between numbers. In that 
regard, he is a musician in the tradition of George Shearing; his playing, like 
Shearing's, is an extension of a civilized give-and-take between a performer 
and his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps at that point the comparison with Shearing and the jazz tradition 
stops. On one hand, Owen deserves admiration for his determination, as a 
composer, to establish his own vision and for his refusal (on this night, 
anyway) to display interest in the Great Jazz Repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
But fine as some of his pieces are -- such as "Reflections of a Detective, 3 
A.M." -- to carry off 2 hours of personal musical vision would tax all but a 
handful of compositional geniuses, the likes of Duke Ellington or Thelonious 
Monk. 
</P>
<P>
The most stunning moment of the night came in Owen's moving tribute to his 
brother's former schoolteacher -- a young woman named Patty Pratt, killed in an 
accident at 26, who wrote "He Belongs," a beautiful song in the mode of "You'll 
Never Walk Alone." Her song received a probing philosophical solo that 
suggested Owen's reflective musical sensitivity deserves more room than his own 
compositions can give it. 
</P>
<P>
Owen's success as a writer has clearly attracted a following. But the 
liabilities of the restricted format he emphasizes -- despite ventures into 
mid-range blues and boogie-woogie, and his appreciation for salsa and other 
rhythmic cadences -- do full justice neither to his own interpretive talent nor 
to the classic musical heritage known as jazz. That heritage gains too little 
attention in a rock-drenched culture. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carman's work on soprano and tenor saxophones carried this night to its 
sweetest moments. His exquisite reading of "Three A.M." carried a Stan 
Getz-like clarity. Thomas' exuberance on several percussion instruments lent 
affectionate energy to a sometimes-unvaried mood of unabashedly romantic 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
At its most compelling, the evening approached the funky warmth of Vince 
Guaraldi. Yet even a full-fledged devotee might hope to hear how Sandy Owen's 
chops stand up to the songbooks of Billy Strayhorn, Johnny Mandel and Wayne 
Shorter.

STRAUSS MUSIC WALTZES INTO COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
ALFRED ESCHWE TO CONDUCT VIENNA JOHANN STRAUSS ORCHESTRA'S WEST COAST DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a striking resemblance to Johann Strauss Jr., Viennese conductor Alfred 
Eschwe insists he is not a member of the Strauss family. "It must be the 
mustache," he chuckles when considering the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the resemblance is at least convenient. Eschwe, 39, is the frequent 
conductor of an orchestra that has traditionally featured a flamboyant member 
of the Strauss family at its podium. 
</P>
<P>
Eschwe will make his West Coast debut tonight when he conducts the Vienna 
Johann Strauss Orchestra at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. On the 
program will be waltzes, polkas, quadrilles and marches by Johann Strauss Jr., 
including the famous "An der schonen, blauen Donau," a.k.a. the "Blue Danube" 
Waltz. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the concerts we do consist of works by 19th-Century Viennese 
composers," he explained Friday in a telephone conversation from Washington, 
D.C., the first stop on the orchestra's current tour, which continues with 
performances Saturday and Sunday at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. "But 
mostly we play the music of the Strauss family: Johann Sr. and his two most 
popular sons, Johann Jr. and Josef." 
</P>
<P>
The original Strauss family orchestra was formed in 1825 by Johann Sr. Its sole 
purpose was to perform the music of the famous Strauss family. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra nearly monopolized Viennese music halls and ballrooms for more 
than a half-century. Then, it disbanded when a lesser-known march composer, 
C.M. Ziehrer, took it over and combined it with his own orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Eduard Strauss -- a fourth-generation member of the Strauss family -- 
started what is now the Vienna Johann Strauss Orchestra in an effort to revive 
the old orchestra's traditions of performing the compositions of the Strauss 
family. Although Eduard died only 3 years later, the orchestra has continued 
and, as Eschwe puts it, "eagerly awaits its 25th anniversary in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
"It was about 8 years ago that (Willi) Boskovsky asked me if I would tour with 
the orchestra in Spain and Barcelona," Eschwe said. Boskovsky had led the 
orchestra since Eduard's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played in Vienna and Salzburg before, but we are basically a touring 
orchestra made up of members from several different local orchestras, including 
the Tonkunstler Orchestra and the Volksoper Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a busy, eventful 7-year stay in Germany, Eschwe, who was 
born in a small suburb just outside of Vienna, has lived in the Austrian 
capital all his life. His primary studies took place at the University of 
Vienna and the Vienna Conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the last students of Hans Swarowsky in Vienna," he said of the 
conductor and teacher of Zubin Mehta and Claudio Abbado, among others. "My work 
is now about half opera and half symphonic. To date, I have conducted over 50 
operas from 'Don Giovanni' to 'Wozzeck.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an official permanent position with an orchestra -- including 
this one. But the Strauss orchestra has sort of adopted me. I have toured with 
them all over the world, including Japan, where they found the waltzes . . . 
well, . . . very interesting, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Yet in his prodigious career, until this week he had never even visited the 
West Coast, although the orchestra's performed in the Southland in 1984 under 
another conductor. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to my first time in Los Angeles, " he said. "As long as I get 
out of the snow, I'm sure I'll be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Johann Strauss Orchestra of Vienna performs music of Johann Strauss Jr. 
Josef Strauss and Eduard Strauss at 8 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $30. Information: 
(714) 642-8232.

STROMBOTNE IS STILL IN SEARCH OF CHECKMATE WITH HIS CHESS PIECES

A couple of years ago, Southern California painter James Strombotne wrote a 
letter to The Times decrying a lengthy Calendar article about Julian Schnabel, 
whom Strombotne called "yet another manufactured 'genius' from the Big Tower of 
Babel Apple." 
</P>
<P>
The rage that buzzed through his brief letter suggested more than just a 
reader's pique at media attention focused on a young artist he dislikes. 
Strombotne, 54, has been on the art scene for more than 30 years but he is not 
nearly as celebrated as a number of his contemporaries -- among them, Billy Al 
Bengston, Craig Kauffman, Ed Ruscha and John McCracken. 
</P>
<P>
His relative obscurity may be due in part to the insecure position of 
figurative art during the past few decades. But the feistiness of Strombotne's 
early work that impressed reviewers has also softened over the years into fey 
and facile illustration. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe it shouldn't be too surprising that his recent paintings and 
watercolors are showing (through Feb. 3) at the Orange County Center for 
Contemporary Art in Santa Ana, not a major venue in anyone's book. The 
typically cartoonlike figures in his paintings and watercolors are all chess 
pieces (some with distinctly humanoid bodies) caught up in a curious -- and for 
the most part, indecipherable -- game of alliances. 
</P>
<P>
The stronger paintings are the simpler ones, in which Strombotne allows the 
figures in his allegories room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
In "Calamities," for example, an all-red chessboard holds a queen, profiled in 
chalky white, a barrel-chested king marching off the board at the bottom, a 
sleeping knight (the piece that looks like a horse), an incongruous little girl 
pulling a supine dog, and a variety of cheerful or dazed pawns, some of which 
zoom around in the air. At the far edge of the board stand the opposing king 
and queen; just beyond that, an Everyman in suspenders (presumably a player) 
flings up his arms. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what this all is supposed to signify is anyone's guess. But the mood is 
sort of deadpan-zany: a pleasing, if harmless, blend of frolic and dismay. 
</P>
<P>
In other paintings, like "Radiant Queen," the artist embroiders a fanciful 
tapestry of curling white lines around a single chess piece, creating a dense, 
primitivist aura with the suggestion of a radioactive or electrical charge. 
</P>
<P>
The weaker pieces tend to be too busy and crowded, and some of the watercolors 
incorporate tiresomely cute rip-offs of cartoon techniques (dotted lines 
signifying motion, multiple arms or faces on figures). 
</P>
<P>
But the larger difficulty with all of this work is its slightness, its fragile 
and simplistic-seeming imagery and anecdotal approach. It may well be that the 
themes Strombotne has in mind are central and powerful human concerns; but in 
the translation of idea to paint, most of the guiding vision seems to have 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
Also showing at OCCCA are satirical terra-cotta busts of male "types" by 
Bardene Allen and prints by Joan Popovich-Kutscher. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's figures wear their preoccupations on their persons: one guy has dollar 
signs on his eyeballs; another has credit card bills arrayed on his chest; a 
third sports Ray-Ban-style shades "reflecting" the images of buxom nude women. 
But this is the kind of easy-target, knee-jerk stuff that most artists get out 
of their systems during their school days. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's stronger suits are her relaxed, brightly expressionistic 
application of paint (similar to the look of Bay Area Figurative paintings of 
the 1950s) and her evocation of characteristic postures and expressions -- 
particularly in a slack-jawed sleeping man and the hollow desperation in the 
flung-back head of a yuppie overachiever. 
</P>
<P>
Popovich-Kutscher's prints are peppered with recurrent images of unraveling 
ropes, tiny arrows and geometric forms, fragments of screens or fences and 
irregular scraps of paper that look somewhat like maps. The mysterious titles 
-- "Power of Dark Sad," "My Feeling of Lemon Life," "I Couldn't My Appearance" 
-- sound as though they were invented by someone uncertain about the way the 
English language fits together. 
</P>
<P>
One piece ("Little Girl of Me") is more immediately revelatory of the forces 
shaping the artist's point of view. The scraps of paper are portions of a 
social worker's report: "Mother sorry child born and wishes for immediate 
termination of uncertainty about diagnosis and placement. . . . In spite of 
mother's rejection of child who is different, child relates to people and has a 
sweet happy smile. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As a 3-year-old, Popovich-Kutscher was institutionalized in a home for retarded 
children. It took several years for doctors to realize that she was deaf, not 
mentally deficient. Seen in that light, the abstract prints may seem to echo 
the artist's fears and confusions, and the frustrating barriers separating her 
from the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
But for the viewer innocent of the salient facts of Popovich-Kutscher's life, 
the work comes across as earnest and carefully executed but ultimately too 
blandly self-effacing to create much of an impression. Once again, there seems 
to be a gap between the enormous freight the artist has put on the ship she is 
sending out to sea and the slim pickings that reach the opposite shore, where 
the viewer stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Work by James Strombotne, Bardene Allen and Joan Popovich-Kutscher remains on 
view through Feb. 3 at the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art, 3621 W. 
MacArthur Blvd., Space 111, Santa Ana. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., 
Wednesday through Sunday. Admission: free. Information: (714) 549-4989.

Japan's new emperor said today he will help safeguard the democratic 
constitution, and leftist politicians urged vigilance against any government 
effort to use the monarchy for "reactionary" ends. 
</P>
<P>
One Communist and five Socialist legislators boycotted the ceremony at which 
Emperor Akihito pledged himself to the constitution imposed by the United 
States after World War II, but two Socialists did attend. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stayed away said the monarchy's close links to the Shinto religion 
violate the constitutional separation of state and religion. They were invited 
in their capacities as chairmen of parliamentary committees. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Imperial Palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed registers of 
condolence for Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer last week at age 87. His 
62-year reign was marked by the rise of militarism, defeat in the war and 
Japan's emergence as a leading economic power. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his father, who was 
thought a living god until he renounced the concept of imperial divinity after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would continue on Hirohito's 
path, "making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire as 
well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of Japan."

LAST REAGAN BUDGET: MORE FOR DEFENSE, LESS FOR REST; 
</P>
<P>
$1.1-TRILLION FIGURE DUE BUSH REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan today sent Congress a $1.15-trillion farewell budget that 
attacks his biggest economic failure, the federal deficit, by again offering up 
domestic cuts while still increasing defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
The President's ninth and final spending plan -- out of balance like all of his 
others -- is largely an academic exercise, certain to be overhauled to reflect 
the priorities of a Democratic-controlled Congress and President-elect Bush, 
after his inauguration Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called Reagan's final spending proposal "an excellent budget which 
demonstrates clearly" that the deficit can be reduced without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I support its intent. However, I will continue to review it for 
possible amendments after I assume the office of the presidency," Bush said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats, however, found much to criticize. Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) faulted the Reagan budget for relying 
exclusively on domestic spending cuts to lower the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides a formula for a meaner, harsher America rather than a kinder, 
gentler one," Sasser said in a statement. "It is a blueprint for mounting debt, 
a continued reliance on foreign capital and a steadily eroding standard of 
living for Americans." If Reagan's ideas were adopted in their entirety, the 
deficit would fall to $92.5 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, the lowest since 
1981 when he took office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Taxes Not Required' 
</P>
<P>
"This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible 
without raising taxes," Reagan said in his budget message. "It can be done in a 
reasonable, responsible way -- with discipline and fairness. New taxes are not 
required." 
</P>
<P>
In his proposals, Reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government 
programs, slashing spending on farm programs by $9.7 billion and trimming the 
growth in Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health programs, by about $5 
billion. The Pentagon's budget, on the other hand, was awarded a big spending 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
To protect his defense buildup, one of the hallmarks of his presidency, Reagan 
proposed a 5.4% increase to $315.2 billion in spending authority, 2% higher 
than the expected rate of inflation. As part of the increase, the budget seeks 
a 44% increase in spending authority for development of the space-based "Star 
Wars" nuclear defense shield. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 82 individual programs recommended for termination by Reagan are the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the Legal Services Corp., the Economic 
Development Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission, direct loans 
by the Small Business Administration, Amtrak railroad passenger subsidies, mass 
transit grants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan has tried and failed over the years to get Congress to go along with 
these proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Many private economists believe Reagan's 1990 deficit estimate is based on 
overly optimistic assessments about how the economy will perform, including 
expectations that growth will continue at a rapid clip while inflation and 
interest rates both decline.

Accidents among U.S. commercial airlines decreased in 1988 but the year-end 
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland sent the annual death toll well above 
the previous year, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board issued figures showing that the rates 
and total number of accidents dropped significantly from 1987 among major 
airlines and commuter carriers -- with record lows for general domestic 
aviation. Last month's 270 deaths in the crash of Flight 103 in Lockerbie, 
Scotland, however, sent the annual fatality toll among major commercial 
carriers up to 285 from the previous year's 231, according to the preliminary 
statistics.

HIGH COURT TO REVIEW MO. ABORTION LAW; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT. ASKING PANEL TO REVERSE ITS LANDMARK '73 RULING

<P>
The Supreme Court, acting in an appeal urging reversal of its landmark 1973 
decision that legalized abortion nationwide, today agreed to review a Missouri 
law regulating abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling that struck 
down key provisions of the state law. 
</P>
<P>
Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouri officials, the case 
had become the most-watched battleground in the continuing political war over 
abortion. Justice Department lawyers also are urging the high court to use the 
case as a means of undoing its 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that the justices will 
reconsider Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve the Missouri 
controversy without significantly changing the 1973 decision or other past 
rulings on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 Key Provisions 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down, among other 
aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these five provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run facilities for 
abortions not necessary to save a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ban on any public employee's performing or assisting an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A ban on using taxpayer money for "encouraging or counseling" women to have 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to be older 
than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to determine whether the fetus 
is capable of surviving outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A declaration that "the life of each human being begins at conception." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'73 Decision Challenged 
</P>
<P>
In the appeal acted on today, Missouri Atty. Gen. William L. Webster said the 
8th Circuit Court's ruling "expands (Supreme Court) precedents in favor of 
abortion on demand, further contracts the state's compelling interest in the 
life of viable, unborn children and disregards this court's holdings that 
abortion is a private matter which government need in no way subsidize." 
</P>
<P>
The 1973 decision "should itself be reconsidered" if it cannot be squared with 
the disputed Missouri law, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's civil rights 
division, wrote to Missouri officials last summer urging them to include a 
challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's appeal.

SONG PUBLISHERS CALL TUNE IN SELLER'S MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM K. KNOEDELSEDER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the entertainment industry, music publishing used to be considered the plain 
little sister of the more glamorous movie, TV, record and video businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore, however. Spurred on by increased record sales, higher song royalty 
rates and licensing fees, and an explosion of music-consuming cable and 
satellite TV programming overseas, music publishing has suddenly become one of 
the hottest commodities in show business. In fact, some think the song market 
is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
Recent acquisitions of music publishing catalogues have totaled more than $1 
billion, according to some estimates. Last week alone, Sony Corp.'s CBS Records 
unit paid about $40 million for Nashville-based country music publisher Tree 
International, and the British entertainment conglomerate Thorn-EMI agreed to 
purchase the 250,000-song catalogue of SBK Entertainment World for an 
unprecedented $337 million. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the inflationary spiral, SBK Entertainment bought nearly all 
of its song catalogue in 1986 from CBS Records' former owner, CBS Inc., for 
$125 million -- a price that many thought was high at the time. Some experts 
said the same thing last year, when Warner Bros. Music purchased Chappell &amp; 
Co., with its estimated 400,000-song catalogue, for a reported $225 million to 
$250 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Now people are saying it again about Thorn-EMI; everybody's got a new number 
to criticize," said Jay Morgenstern, executive vice president of 
Warner-Chappell Music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally a seller's market right now," said Chuck Kaye, who was president 
of Warner Bros. Music at the time of the Chappell takeover and later quit to 
form his own Burbank-based publishing company, Windswept Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this coming," Kaye said. "When I saw what was being paid for Chappell, I 
said, 'I have to get a piece of this; I want to be in on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
With financing from a Japanese telecommunications firm, Fuji-Sankei Group, 
Kaye's Windswept recently acquired New York-based Big Seven Music, whose 
6,000-song catalogue includes such 1950s and 1960s pop hits as "Why Do Fools 
Fall in Love," "I Think We're Alone Now" and "Mony, Mony." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assets 'Undervalued' 
</P>
<P>
"I think the economics finally caught up with the business," Kaye said. "And I 
just got in under the wire." 
</P>
<P>
A music publisher owns or oversees song copyrights, licensing them for use in 
television, movies, advertising and other commercial contexts. The publisher 
collects the fees and royalties from the various uses of its songs, generally 
splitting the proceeds with the songwriter or copyright owner. 
</P>
<P>
According to Edward P. Murphy, president of the National Music Publishers 
Assn., the high prices being paid for song catalogues are not unwarranted. "I 
think these assets have been undervalued for some time in relationship to 
earnings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased royalties paid to music publishers by record companies 
-- which have seen their unit sales rise at an annual rate of nearly 20% in the 
past few years -- "the amount of music being used in TV commercials has 
increased, at very high fees," Murphy said. "The price range for a song used on 
a national commercial is now $200,000 and on up." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign income for music publishers "is going up between 30% and 
40% a year," Murphy said. "As a result of all the expansion in Europe -- cable 
TV, satellite TV, free TV, the BBC's addition of new channels -- they are using 
music over there at a higher rate all of a sudden. The amount of music being 
consumed is tremendous -- also in South America and other emerging nations. The 
demand for Anglo-American repertoire is just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
"Software is king in the entertainment business, and music is just another form 
of entertainment software," said Fred Anschel, an analyst for the New York 
investment firm of Dean Witter Reynolds. "What they are getting is their pound 
of flesh for all the new uses of music, all the new TV channels." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easier Than Drilling 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst for the Los Angeles investment firm of Crowell, 
Weedon &amp; Co., said he sees an analogy between what's happening in the music 
publishing business and the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easier to buy reserves than to drill," he said. "And song 
copyrights are reserves. They're an annuity whose value can go up ten- or a 
hundredfold." 
</P>
<P>
Logsdon offered an extreme example of the current frenzy to acquire song 
copyrights: 
</P>
<P>
"We recently saw a deal involving a two-artist company with a negative net 
worth and major lawsuit against them that they are going to lose. And 50% of 
that company is being bought for $4 million -- with only seven song titles in 
copyright." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of the recent acquisition binge has been a marked consolidation in 
the industry. The four largest firms of just four years ago -- Warner Bros. 
Music, Chappell &amp; Co., EMI Music and CBS Songs -- have been reduced to two 
huge firms, holding close to 1 million copyrights between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's good for the business or not," said Chuck Kaye. "It's 
made a lot of people wealthy and put lot of copyrights in a couple of corporate 
pockets, but those big companies can't dictate the economic policy of the 
industry because royalty rates are dictated by the government and tribunals. 
They cannot set economic standards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Pork Bellies' 
</P>
<P>
Some in the industry are concerned about the buying and selling frenzy. "It's a 
little bit reactionary; I see song catalogues being passed around like poker 
chips," said Lance Freed, president of Los Angeles-based Almo Irving Music. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a set multiple for buying a song -- four to eight times its 
annual net publisher earnings," said Freed. "But now they're becoming 
commodities like pork bellies or gold, where the value is what people are are 
willing to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that, despite all this insanity and the focusing on the bottom 
line that will result from these huge prices being paid, the business stays 
somewhat creative." 
</P>
<P>
"We think the premiums being paid right now are extreme," said Nicholas Firth, 
president of BMG Music Publishing Group in New York. "People are investing 
right, left and center, and a lot of these purchases are being made based on a 
very bullish scenario. It's like the leveraged buyout game -- one thing feeds 
on another." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Irwin Z. Robinson, president of EMI Music Publishing Worldwide, 
still thinks his company is getting a bargain in its $337-million purchase of 
SBK Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"A very good copyright lawyer, Lee Eastman, who is also Paul McCartney's 
father-in-law, once said to me, 'Irwin, when you buy a copyright that has a 
track record, you can almost never overpay for it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I've pretty much lived by that ever since," Robinson said.

Roughly one in six Orange County families could afford the average 
single-family house in November, 1988, contrasted with one in four families in 
November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While the jump in Orange County home prices slowed in the fall contrasted with 
the spring and summer, the effects of the yearlong price surge are still 
evident in the California Assn. of Realtors' affordability index, released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Only 16% of the county's families could afford the median home price of 
$230,701, contrasted with 26% in November, 1987, when the median price was 
$178,870. 
</P>
<P>
New homes -- which average even higher prices -- are excluded from the survey 
by the trade association. Home buyers statewide also faced a crunch, though not 
as severe as in Orange County and some of the state's other urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21% of the state's residents could afford the average used home in 
November, the lowest that number has been since the trade association began 
charting the monthly changes in January, 1984. The trade association said it 
expects the number to drop still further as interest rates increase this year.

The body of a man burned beyond recognition was found on a beach road near 
Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach on Sunday night, police said.

A patrol officer found the body at 11:15 p.m. about one mile west of Golden 
West Street, Huntington Beach Police Lt. Bill Mamelli said. "The body had been 
set afire with an unknown flammable liquid," Mamelli said. "The body was burned 
beyond recognition and (investigators) were unable to determine at this time 
the cause of death or if the homicide occurred at that location or somewhere 
else."

The Soviet Union's suicide rate has fallen since 1985, partly as a result of 
the Kremlin's anti-alcohol campaign, a Soviet medical journal said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 54,000 people killed themselves in the Soviet Union, Meditsinskaya 
Gazeta said, citing the States Statistics Committee as its source. 
</P>
<P>
It did not give any overall statistics for any other year but did say that the 
rate had declined, especially among men, since 1985. For example, among men 
aged 50 to 59, the suicide rate fell from 98.5 per 100,000 people in 1985 to 
56.1 in 1987, it said.

More than 600 North Korean art works have arrived in South Korea, marking the 
first direct trade between the two rival Korean states, government officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings and pottery, worth $104,000, were imported by Daewoo Corp. of 
Seoul in a deal with a North Korean trading firm, said the officials, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first direct deal between the two Koreas since the Seoul government 
lifted a ban on trade with the north in October, as part of a new policy of 
seeking improved relations with the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
The art works will be sold to the public after display at major department 
stores, the officials said. It was not known how the goods arrived in South 
Korea.

N.Y. TIMES CO. TO SELL CABLE TV; MINORITY SHARE IS KEY TO DEAL

<P>
The New York Times Co. has agreed to sell its cable television system for $420 
million in cash to an investment group that will include at least 20% minority 
ownership, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
J. Bruce Llewellyn, a Philadelphia soft-drink bottling executive who is one of 
the nation's top black business executives, will head the minority investment 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The other investors, which will evenly split the majority ownership of the 
company, are two cable TV companies based in the Philadelphia area, Comcast 
Corp. and Lenfest Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
NYT Cable TV of Cherry Hill, N.J., which serves 162,000 subscribers in southern 
New Jersey, apparently will become the nation's biggest cable television system 
with at least 20% minority ownership, parties to the deal said. 
</P>
<P>
By selling to a group that includes minorities, the New York Times Co. will be 
able to defer taxes on its gain from the sale, which it expects to be $320 
million before taxes, according to David Gorham, the company's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The tax-deferral provision was created by Congress in 1978 to encourage 
minority ownership of communications companies. The minority group has to be 
the managing partner in order for the deal to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission must certify that the deal meets the 
intent of Congress. Gorham said the FCC has indicated that approval is likely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Above-Average Cost 
</P>
<P>
NYT Cable TV serves 59 communities in southern New Jersey, all within about 35 
miles of its Cherry Hill headquarters. Its number of subscribers is expected to 
increase to 170,000 by the time the deal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
At a price of $420 million, the price per subscriber will be $2,470, slightly 
above the average for recent deals. 
</P>
<P>
Llewellyn has not finished lining up the minority investors who will join his 
group and, until he does, the percentage of the company that his group controls 
will not be decided, according to Julian Brodsky, vice chairman of Comcast.

MEDIATED EASTERN AIR-UNION TALKS BREAK DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
Federally mediated talks between Eastern Airlines and its largest union 
apparently broke off today, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"I confirm that at this point (negotiations halted)," Eastern spokesman Robin 
Matell said. "Right now we are assessing what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give any positions at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan wasn't immediately available 
for comment today, nor were National Mediation Board Chairman Walter Wallace 
and mediator Harry Bickford, who was joined by Wallace for talks beginning last 
Friday at the Sheraton Hotel in Key Largo, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern-Machinists negotiations went into federal mediation nearly one year 
ago after direct negotiations stalemated. Wallace joined Bickford in an effort 
to get the talks moving, but sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there had been virtually no progress during the lengthy weekend sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooling-Off Period 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has been pressing for federal declaration of an impasse, which would 
begin a 30-day cooling-off period. After the 30 days, the union could strike 
and the company could impose its own work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said that only the pressure of a deadline, which the mediators have 
refused to set, will get the negotiations moving. The union has claimed that 
Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can try to break it and bust the union. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern put out a bulletin to its employees Sunday reporting that the 
Machinists' lead negotiator had walked out. William Scheri, the national 
Machinists' union airline chief negotiator, had participated for the first time 
in the Eastern mediation last weekend, but left Key Largo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Scheri's sudden departure after the Wallace announcement of 'no deadline' 
for these talks reinforces our previously stated belief that the IAM will not 
take the talks seriously until the NMB starts the 30-day cooling-off period," 
the company bulletin said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mediators said they had been informed earlier that Scheri planned 
to participate only through the weekend before returning to Washington 
headquarters of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, have been about $200 
million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers 
and other ground service workers, or more than one-fourth of Eastern's 
employees, were seeking $50 million for raises. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern was asking $150 million in concessions, mostly from the non-mechanics.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY FIGHTS BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
The tobacco industry, in newspaper ads running around the country today, touted 
a survey indicating that three of four Americans don't support workplace or 
restaurant smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbying organization, the 
Tobacco Institute, comes during the week marking the 25th anniversary of the 
first of the surgeon general's reports to declare smoking a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted that some anti-smoking 
groups are pushing for a "smoke-free" society. "To achieve their purposes," she 
said, "anti-smokers are turning to censorship, harassment, punitive taxes and 
intrusion into personal and private decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, do not support 
these anti-smoking efforts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm of Hamilton, 
Frederick &amp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned 1,500 Americans 
over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. The respondents included 1,099 
nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are satisfied with 
current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposed outright bans in the 
workplace or public areas.

Sebastian Coe, a four-time Olympic medalist who was left off the British team 
for the Seoul Olympics, will return to his nation's squad for the European 
Indoor Track and Field Championships in February. 
</P>
<P>
Coe has been selected to run the 800 meters for Britain at the Feb. 18 and 19 
meet at The Hague although he has not competed indoors at that distance since 
1983, when he set a world-best time of 1 minute, 44.91 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Coe, who won the 800-meter indoor European title in 1977, has 
been training in Florida and said he plans to run in several races in the 
United States this winter to prepare for the European championships. 
</P>
<P>
Coe, who captured gold medals in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics in the 1,500 meters 
and silver medals in the 800 meters in each of those Games, was left off the 
British squad for Seoul after performing poorly at the British Olympic trials 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic decision was controversial in Britain because of Coe's exploits, 
and International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch even 
lobbied to get a special exemption for Coe to run in Seoul, but the British 
selectors would not add him to the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said I did not want to run for Britain again," Coe said after his 
selection for the European indoor championships. "I am planning a full program 
of races this winter."
