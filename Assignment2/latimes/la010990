Jesse James and John Dillinger would fit right in. But today, instead of waving 
guns at stage coaches and bank tellers, they might well be getting the drop on 
travel agents -- and stealing airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The taking of blank ticket stock in armed holdups has become a major menace to 
the nation's travel agents and a big worry to the airlines, which are losing 
millions of dollars as a result. Bandits are not the only problem, however, as 
ever-increasing numbers of counterfeiters, con men, corrupt travel agents and 
credit card cheats are also stealing ticket blanks. 
</P>
<P>
The blanks are extremely valuable because thieves can simply fill in the 
amounts they want to steal. A blank ticket is even better than blank check, 
because no signature is necessary. The thieves sell them for expensive travel 
at huge discounts -- often, but by no means always, to unsuspecting customers. 
Sometimes they are brazen enough to try to turn them in for cash "refunds." 
</P>
<P>
Most stolen tickets are written for international flights in first class. It is 
estimated that the average stolen blank is used for $1,000 worth of travel. 
Many such tickets are used for even more expensive trips -- on the supersonic 
Concorde, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of incentive to take blank ticket stock," said Kenneth D. 
Gilbart, a corporate security official with United Airlines. "Blank ticket 
stock can be diverted into a lot of value. It is more or less like cash -- in 
fact, maybe better than cash in a way. If you rob a bank you get $300, but you 
can take a blank ticket and bump it up to any figure you want to." 
</P>
<P>
John D. Boggs, managing director of ticketing and terminal services for 
American Airlines, said: "It doesn't take a lot of tickets to get something 
negotiable for a significant amount of cash." 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, the latest period for which figures were 
available, United confiscated stolen tickets that had been filled in for trips 
worth $232,000. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal acquisition and use of airline tickets increasingly cuts into the 
carriers' profits. If it is correct that the average stolen blank is used for 
$1,000 worth of travel, then in the last year about $100-million worth of 
airline tickets were taken illegally, at gunpoint or in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
That is almost enough to buy one of the Boeing 747-400s that have just come on 
the market. It is an amount also equal to the net profits of USAir, the 
nation's sixth-largest airline, in the first nine months of 1989. And no one 
knows how many tickets stolen in previous years but not yet used are still out 
there. There have been estimates that these might represent $500-million worth 
of travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Such losses are passed on to airline stockholders (in the form of reduced 
dividends) and to the traveling public in higher fares," said Voit Gilmore, 
operator of Four Seasons Travel Service in Pinehurst, N. C., and president of 
the American Society of Travel Agents. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has taken on more serious proportions because so much violence now 
accompanies the crimes. In 1989, one travel agent was killed in a holdup and 
another in Southern California was knifed. Both were attacked while trying to 
protect their blank airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the taking of tickets through violence has been growing steadily 
throughout the nation, law enforcement officials, airline executives and travel 
agents say the problem is most serious in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, there were 23 armed robberies in which airline ticket stock was taken, 
a record number, according to the Airline Reporting Corp., a ticket 
clearinghouse in Washington that is owned by the U.S. carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those robberies occurred in California, which has more travel agents -- 
5,591 or 16% of all agents nationwide -- than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
In all of 1988, tickets were taken in just eight armed robberies. The number of 
blanks taken in these incidents jumped from 423 in 1988 to 4,318 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And these figures don't tell the whole story. Law enforcement officials pointed 
out that the Airline Reporting Corp.'s numbers do not include robberies of 
agencies in which no tickets were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Although people caught with stolen tickets invariably plead that they did not 
know their origin, law enforcement officials scoff at such claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Detective's View 
</P>
<P>
Charles Schmidt, a detective with the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey, said that some famous entertainers and sports figures have been caught 
trying to get on planes with tickets acquired improperly. 
</P>
<P>
One well known Hollywood couple -- both are in the movies -- recently bought 
stolen tickets and were about to use them on Air France. The airline found out 
about it and warned them. They subsequently purchased legitimate tickets and 
claimed that their production company had unwittingly purchased the stolen 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, who is one of half a dozen police officials who work full time on 
ticket fraud (others are in Miami, Los Angeles and at Britain's Scotland Yard) 
said that few people who use bogus tickets are innocent. "If you get a $7,000 
ticket for $3,500, and it says $7,000 right on it," Schmidt said, "there is a 
presumption that something is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The tickets are often sold through newspaper classified advertisements or in 
bulk quantities to rings that arrange travel for illegal aliens who have been 
smuggled into Southern California and are headed for destinations throughout 
the United States. Bad tickets have also been traced to Europe, where they are 
sold and seldom detected. 
</P>
<P>
For holdup men, blank tickets are higher on the most-favored-items-to-steal 
list than blank checks. Indeed, armed robbers at travel agencies have 
frequently demanded tickets without even asking for cash or other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular method of stealing tickets is to divert the attention of a 
travel agent or airline ticket clerk and simply grab some blank tickets. These 
sneak thieves might bring along a boisterous group of fellow "customers" or 
have screaming children in their arms. Feigning sudden illness is another 
favorite trick. Often the loss of blank tickets is discovered only days later. 
</P>
<P>
During lunch hour or early or late in the day -- a time when few employees are 
around -- is when thieves most often strike. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph E. Conner Jr., owner of the El Monte Travel Center in El Monte, Calif., 
said that his wife, Jean, was alone in the agency office when three people held 
her up for 188 tickets. That occurred Sept. 11, four days before 46-year-old 
Van Nuys travel agent Hernan Vacha was shot to death in a robbery at Excelsior 
Travel and Tours. 
</P>
<P>
While stolen tickets cause most of the trouble, airlines also must cope with 
forged or altered tickets, counterfeit tickets, and tickets bought with stolen 
or otherwise unauthorized credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
Often, in what in travel agency vernacular is called a "bust out," agency 
owners in financial difficulties close up shop and abscond with the ticket 
stock. Agencies might be sold to crooked individuals who want them just to get 
their hands on unused tickets. Employees of airlines have been known to point 
out agencies in financial difficulties to such individuals. Prosecutors 
recently charged an Alitalia employee with helping to identify failing 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Once tickets are stolen, it takes a certain expertise to prepare them for 
undetected use. Because airline tickets are generic, they must be properly 
filled in and validated with special stamps denoting the name of the airline 
and a travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
Since many travel agents now use tickets prepared by machine, a thief must also 
have the proper hardware, such as a personal computer, to make a stolen ticket 
look authentic. Validating stamps also are often stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to be under the impression that you can go and hold up a 
travel agency and that you immediately have something that is convertible to 
cash," said David R. B. Collins, president of the Airline Reporting Corp. "Lots 
of know-how is needed in order to make it look like the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Criminals 
</P>
<P>
But one law enforcement official said that there are plenty of criminals around 
with such practical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"They read the travel magazines and get information from them," said Gail 
Coutts, a detective with the Los Angeles police airline ticket forgery squad. 
One such "bad guy," she recalled, "had an article from the Airline Reporting 
Corp. about fraudulent tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Many thieves are insiders, or at least people with a working knowledge of the 
travel business, law enforcement officials say. United Airlines, for example, 
lost more than $60,000 last year because an employee of a Chicago company that 
had a travel agency's computerized machine in its office stole a large amount 
of ticket stock. The employee took the tickets after after he learned that he 
was about to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the people who prepare stolen tickets for sale are not the robbers or 
burglars, who are hired to do the dirty work. "I think that this is a core 
group with interchangeable parts," Coutts said. 
</P>
<P>
The rash of crimes involving airline tickets has put the airlines and the 
travel agents at odds over who is responsible for the losses and how they can 
be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines claim that travel agents are frequently negligent in protecting 
their ticket stock. If it is determined that the travel agent has not 
safeguarded tickets properly, the airlines hold the agent responsible for the 
travel when it takes place and charge the agency accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Airline Reporting Corp. rules limit an agency to ordering no more than a 
three-month supply of tickets at a time, with the specific amount determined by 
the agency's past level of business. An agency may not keep more than a week's 
worth of blanks on the premises, and those must be kept in a safe overnight. 
The rest must be stored elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Paul G. Davidoff, owner of Belair Travel Consultants in Bowie, Md., and 
president-elect of that American Society of Travel Agents, said he keeps only 
an immediate supply at the agency. The rest, he says, he keeps across the 
street in a trunk in the vault of a bank. "When we need tickets," he said, "I 
walk across the street and fetch them." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the Airline Reporting Corp.'s stringent rules, the group does not 
want travel agents to risk injury to protect tickets. It instructs agents not 
to resist robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The travel agents, for their part, say that the airlines are not doing enough 
to catch ticket criminals, especially at the time they try to board flights. 
The airlines counter that such procedures would slow airport check-in 
procedures and require hiring more people. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Schmidt said, however: "We find the airlines at fault for not 
screening tickets. It is not true that it would slow things down. It would take 
15 seconds a passenger to check each passenger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airlines Use Profile 
</P>
<P>
The airlines concede that they do not check every ticket, but they say that 
their employees at airport gates are under orders to look out for passengers 
who fit descriptions of terrorists, ticket thieves and other undesirables. If a 
passenger fits such a profile, he or she is kept under close scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Also, once a ticket theft is reported to the Airline Reporting Corp., the 
ticket numbers are immediately put into the airlines' computerized "black 
lists." But airline gate personnel often don't have time to check the computer; 
to encourage them, some airlines pay a bounty, usually $25, for catching a bad 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The travel agents are demanding that the airlines come up with new technology 
for detecting stolen tickets. For example, magnetic strips, similar to those on 
credit cards, could be used to verify tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But Joe Whitby, a security official with British Airways, said a magnetic strip 
procedure would be difficult to use, since there are so many ticket formats in 
the world. The only "sure fire" way to block the use of stolen tickets, he 
said, is to have airline gate workers check the black list. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage the airlines to develop procedures that would make the 
use of stolen tickets more difficult," said Davidoff, the Maryland travel 
agent. "If they are harder to use, the incentive to steal them would decline 
greatly."

U.S. PRAISES SALVADOR ACTION IN JESUIT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration praised El Salvador on Monday for admitting military 
involvement in the recent slayings of six Jesuit priests, but members of 
Congress suggested that continued U.S. military support for the tiny Central 
American nation might be in jeopardy unless the killers are punished. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani had shown "great courage" in announcing Sunday night that the 
preliminary investigation into the killings had implicated his own military. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked that the investigation be thorough and the prosecution move ahead, 
and it looks like that is the course he (Cristiani) is on. He deserves a lot of 
credit," Fitzwater told reporters traveling with President Bush to Orlando, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the findings an 
"important breakthrough" that "puts to rest" widespread speculation, especially 
among congressional skeptics, that the Salvadoran government would never blame 
its own powerful military establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The slain priests, all members of the faculty of the Jesuit-run Central 
American University in El Salvador's capital city, were taken from their beds 
at the university residence before dawn Nov. 16 and shot to death with 
automatic weapons. Also slain was the priests' housekeeper and her 15-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Progress in solving the brutal killings appeared crucial to whether Congress 
would continue sending military aid to the Cristiani government, which 
currently receives more than $300 million a year in U.S. assistance. 
Cristiani's announcement marked the first time that a Salvadoran president has 
blamed the military for a so-called "death squad" murder. 
</P>
<P>
Although Congress is in recess until Jan. 23, several lawmakers likely to play 
key roles in the debate over aid to El Salvador offered only qualified praise 
for Cristiani's announcement. They said they will withhold judgment until the 
perpetrators of the crime are identified, arrested and punished. 
</P>
<P>
"I have told President Cristiani that there will be a major crisis in 
U.S.-Salvadoran relations unless this investigation is carried out completely, 
regardless of where it leads," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of 
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy added that he will continue to press in the Senate for a strong link 
between U.S. aid and respect for human rights in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall human rights situation there is appalling," he said, "and the 
United States has an obligation to use its enormous influence through its aid 
program to insist on concrete improvements in human rights by the Salvadoran 
government, the armed forces and the police." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), one of the most vocal critics of El Salvador 
in the Senate, called Cristiani's admission "a long-overdue but welcome step 
toward justice in this brutal killing." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kennedy said the "key issue" remains Cristiani's progress in 
"identifying the responsible individuals . . . and bringing them to justice, 
regardless of their rank. There must be no further cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) insisted that Cristiani has "to pursue the case 
all the way to the top, to those who pulled the trigger and those who ordered 
it." U.S. aid to El Salvador, he added, "hangs in the balance." 
</P>
<P>
Congress' skepticism reflects the fact that, although thousands of people have 
been killed over the past decade by suspected right-wing death squads connected 
directly or indirectly to the military, no Salvadoran military officer has ever 
been convicted of murder in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest number of right-wing death-squad killings occurred during the 
early years of the Salvadoran civil war, which began in early 1980. When 
Cristiani's right-wing administration was elected to office last year, it was 
feared there could be a major resurgence of death squad activity, with leftist 
civilians as the targets. 
</P>
<P>
And while Cristiani's government managed initially to keep that from happening, 
renewed terrorism by left-wing guerrillas touched off a fresh spiral of 
politically motivated slayings, including the killing of the six priests. 
</P>
<P>
Widely assumed to have been the work of military men stationed near the 
university campus at that time, the killings provoked outrage in Congress and 
led to new demands for a suspension of U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the admission of military 
involvement in the slayings should not affect U.S. support for Cristiani's 
elected government in its war against the Marxist-led guerrillas. But mindful 
of the strong sentiment on Capitol Hill, she stressed that it is crucial that 
Cristiani "now take actions to prosecute the alleged individuals."

BIG BANKS DROP PRIME LENDING RATE TO 10%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: FIGURE LOWEST SINCE 1988. ADJUSTABLE-RATE HOME LOANS TO GO DOWN; OTHER 
MORTGAGES MAY BE LOWER. 
</P>

<P>
Major banks, foreseeing continued economic weakness, on Monday lowered their 
prime lending rates to 10% from 10.5%. The long-awaited reduction, the first 
drop in the prime since July 31, brought the key rate to its lowest level since 
October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the prime -- the benchmark on which some consumer and business 
loans are based -- will directly result in lower rates on adjustable-rate 
home-equity loans and could be a harbinger of lower rates on home mortgages and 
other loans. 
</P>
<P>
First National Bank of Chicago initiated this latest drop, and was quickly 
followed by Citibank, Morgan Guaranty, Bankers Trust, Security Pacific, First 
Interstate Bank of California, Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and other 
major banks. 
</P>
<P>
As the Federal Reserve has eased interest rates in response to a slowing 
economy, the prime has fallen three times from its peak last spring of 11.5%. 
Many economists predict that the prime will fall at least one more time in the 
first half of this year, before starting to edge back up. 
</P>
<P>
James Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said his 
institution decided to make the move when "we sat down and looked at all the 
figures, and they indicated an economy that is continuing to weaken." 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the falling prime has offered substantial relief to 
consumers, including those with the popular adjustable-rate home equity loans. 
About half of the $75 billion in outstanding home equity loans are tied to the 
prime and readjusted monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of a consumer with a $75,000, 10-year adjustable-rate home 
equity loan. If this borrower took out the loan in January, 1988, when the 
prime was 8.75%, he would have paid $939.95 a month, according to WEFA Group, 
an economic forecasting firm in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
At the prime's peak last spring, his payment would have ballooned to $1,054.57. 
With this latest cut, the monthly payment would fall $63.34, or 6%, to $991.13. 
</P>
<P>
The latest cut in the prime had been widely predicted for some time, and 
particularly since the third week in December, when the Fed allowed another key 
rate, the federal funds rate, to drop to 8.25%. The federal funds rate is what 
banks charge each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the banks' cost of borrowing and the prime has been wide 
enough to warrant a drop in the prime for the past two months. The banks often 
cut the prime when this "spread" reaches 1.5 percentage points; since early 
November, it has intermittently exceeded 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the banks held back, partly because of a slight end-of-year surge in loan 
demand, and partly because of a need to supplement profits in what has been a 
particularly tough year for many lenders, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in early November, Southwest Bank of St. Louis, often the first bank to 
drop the prime, lowered its rate to 10% from 10.5%. But other banks didn't 
follow suit, and Southwest raised its prime again three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the last three cuts, the prime remains high by historical standards. 
Between 1948 and 1989, the prime has averaged 6.9%, according to WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates have also eased over the past year, and are expected to ease 
somewhat more in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The effective rate on an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined from 11% 
in the second quarter of 1989 to 10.1% in the fourth quarter, said James 
Christian, chief economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in 
Washington. He predicts that the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will fall 
to 8.8% in the second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
One-year adjustable-rate mortgages fell from an average 9.7% rate in the second 
quarter of last year to 9.3% in the fourth quarter; Christian predicts they 
will ease to an average 8.8% in the second quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a newsletter in Alexandria, Va., found in a 
survey of 50 private-sector economists that a majority expected at least one 
more prime-rate cut in the first quarter of this year. It was the consensus of 
the group that the economy would strengthen, and rates resume their rise, in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
While most economists believe the economy is weakening, the extent of that 
weakness is highly debatable, among very mixed signals. "There's no 
overwhelming evidence that the economy is going up or down," said Robert 
Dederick, economist with Northern Trust Co., in Chicago. "If anything, the 
signals are more mixed than they were six weeks ago."

FROG JUMP CONTEST IN CRISIS OVER EXTRA-LARGE LEAPERS 
</P>

Jumpin' jiminy! Can it be? Is someone really trying to slip a ringer into the 
celebrated jumping frog contest of Calaveras County? 
</P>
<P>
Contest organizers said Monday that a Seattle man, a professional importer of 
exotic animals, has created a "superfrog crisis" by trying to enter three 
eight-pound Goliath frogs in the whimsical contest made famous by Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like racing draft horses against Thoroughbreds," complained Diane 
Baumann of the 39th District Agricultural Assn., which runs the annual contest 
as part of the Calaveras County Fair in May. "It's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Baumann said the district's board of directors will meet in executive session 
-- that is, in secret -- on Friday to discuss what to do about the giant 
amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, the board dealt with the entry of tiny but long-leaping 
African runted frogs by requiring that all entrants be at least four inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
That old rule is no problem for these new African entrants. The man who is 
entering them, Andy J. Koffman, says his frogs are close to 10 times that big. 
And, he claims, he has seen Goliath frogs leap 30 or 40 feet in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
The jumping-frog contest record -- for a combined total of three leaps from the 
center of a 35-foot-diameter stage -- is 21 feet, 5 3/4 inches. Anyone who 
beats that record wins $1,000 on top of the $500 annual first prize, Baumann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Koffman asserts that his entrants can easily shatter that record with just one 
jump -- and are more than likely to vault entirely off the stage and into the 
large crowd that gathers in the Central Sierra to see the event. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are skeptical. David B. Wake, a professor of integrative biology at 
the University of California at Berkeley, said the world record for frog 
jumping is only 32 feet, 3 inches -- for three leaps -- by a Rana oxyrhynchus 
in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Goliath frogs) are big, but languid," Wake said. "I'd be surprised if 
they jumped very far at all. If he says they can jump 40 feet, I'd have to say, 
'Show me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely what Koffman, a former California resident, wants to do. "I 
believe it is the destiny of these frogs to win this contest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand what people are saying, that it's not fair for these giant frogs 
to compete," Koffman said in a telephone interview conducted over the cackle of 
the exotic birds he keeps in his house. "But they are what they are: They're 
just frogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Other countries bring in athletes and naturalize them so they can compete in 
the Olympics," he added. "I see this as the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the fair, held in the old mining town of Angels Camp about 110 
miles east of San Francisco, are not so sure. For one thing, one of Koffman's 
frogs is the size of an entire family of the common California bullfrogs that 
normally hop to fame in the tongue-in-cheek competition. 
</P>
<P>
Koffman said his frogs are up to 3 1/2 feet long and weigh up to eight pounds 
-- "I have some 12-pounders on the way that I want to enter, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koffman said he was amazed -- and instantly attracted to entering the frogs at 
the Calaveras contest -- when he saw one leap the 40-foot width of a river in 
Cameroon. He was on a parrot-hunting expedition at the time, he said, but he 
turned his attention to capturing some of the "hundreds" of giant frogs he 
found. Koffman said he brought back 50 and sold most of them to zoos. 
</P>
<P>
He said he still has 20 of the creatures bounding around a specially heated 
pool in his basement at home. 
</P>
<P>
His frogs' leaping skill frightens contest organizers for two reasons: fairness 
and safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to run a fair contest here -- may the best frog win, as they say," 
Baumann said. "We're not sure any of the other frog jockeys would bother to 
enter if they didn't think they had a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Koffman were to jump his frogs alone, she added, there is the fear that 
one of the frogs, weighing half as much as a bowling ball, might injure a 
spectator. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally do not want to go to court on a personal injury lawsuit where 
someone gets whiplash after being hit by a frog," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition is another concern to contest organizers, she added. After all, Mark 
Twain's story recounted how gold-seeking sourdoughs sought to rig the contest 
with a domestic scam -- feeding buckshot to competing frogs. Nowhere in the 
story is there a mention of going overseas for an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it quite seriously," she said. "All kidding aside, it is a very 
serious concern to us." 
</P>
<P>
Not the least of those concerns is the possibility of a lawsuit by Koffman to 
force his frogs into the fray. The Seattle adventurer did not dismiss that 
possibility. "I think I have a right to jump in the contest." But he did say he 
is only looking for a few laughs, and maybe a little publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to upset anybody or make people angry," he said. "I just want to 
go there, jump my frogs and have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he added, he may not be the shoo-in contest organizers fear. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven other potential competitors have already contacted him about buying 
frogs to enter themselves.

POLITICS: MAUREEN O'CONNOR, THE CITY'S FIRST WOMAN MAYOR, SAYS, 'I CAME IN AS A

CAMPAIGN AND ETHICAL REFORMS.

In a surprise announcement, Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Monday night she will 
not seek reelection when her term expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who at age 25 in the mid-'70s was the youngest council member ever 
elected in the city and who later became its first woman mayor, said she will 
not seek another term and instead will devote her time to pushing for a series 
of fundamental campaign and ethical reforms at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the citizens should know I won't be personally benefiting" from any of 
the proposed changes, which includes strengthening the office of mayor in the 
nation's sixth-largest city, the 43-year-old mayor told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in as a maverick and I will go out as a maverick," said O'Connor, who 
has established a reputation of opening City Hall to the common citizen while 
at the same time keeping the city's business establishment and residential 
developers, two traditionally powerful interests, at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, however, O'Connor has been criticized for running a city with 
complex urban problems as though it were a small town and for spending 
inordinate time and energy on specific pet projects, such as the recent Soviet 
Arts Festival, while ignoring other pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
As for what O'Connor will do when her term expires, the mayor said she does not 
know, saying only that she will stay involved in community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, a Democrat in a city long dominated by Republicans, did not rule out 
a possible future in the Legislature or Congress, though she said she has no 
current plans to run for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's climb up the political ladder began in 1971 when, as a gym teacher 
at a Catholic school, she went to City Hall to complain about the treatment a 
troupe of Mexican-Indian performers had received during a city celebration. She 
got the runaround and angrily vowed to seek a seat on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a borrowed library book on political campaigning, the long-shot 
jumped into the race, relying in part on "the Maureen Corps," a large group of 
student volunteers. She won, and stayed for eight years, in time becoming part 
of then-Mayor Pete Wilson's inner circle, despite Wilson's Republican Party 
allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the council, O'Connor remained active on various boards and 
commissions. But before giving up her seat, she married Robert O. Peterson, the 
millionaire founder of the Jack in the Box restaurant chain and a man 30 years 
her senior. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, she lost a bitter race for mayor against Roger Hedgecock, who was 
later convicted of felony campaign disclosure violations. When Hedgecock was 
forced to resign in 1986, O'Connor ran again and was overwhelmingly elected to 
complete his term.

ON CALIFORNIA: A POWER PLAY THE RAIDERS CANNOT LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. JONES 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just about a year ago, the Dallas Cowboys were sold to oil tycoon Jerry Jones 
for $146 million. It was the highest figure ever paid for a professional sports 
team. In exchange for his dollars, tycoon Jones got America's Team plus the 
65,000-seat Texas Stadium plus the training camp. 
</P>
<P>
There was, as always, debate over such a price. It was said that no football 
team would pencil out at $146 million. It was suggested that Jones' psychic 
reward from owning the team must be very great because the financial rewards 
were likely to be meager. 
</P>
<P>
I mention the Cowboys deal and that debate because it now serves as a contrast 
-- or maybe a benchmark -- to the bidding frenzy surrounding the so-called Los 
Angeles Raiders. The bidders come from three California cities, and two of them 
have put offers on the table that dwarf the Cowboys deal. 
</P>
<P>
What's intriguing about the frenzy is that none of the bidders are trying to 
buy the Raiders. This flood of dollars is aimed simply at getting Al Davis and 
his team to show up in a particular town and call it home. Never has so much 
been offered for so little, to wit: 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, developer Gregg Lukenbill and his group have promised, for 
starters, to build the team a $100-million stadium. The group would guarantee 
the Raiders $90 million from ticket sales over the first five years, and $105 
million from luxury boxes and other ancillaries over 20 years. Just to meet 
these payments, Lukenbill would have to see sellouts at virtually every Raider 
game for the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. The Raiders would get a cut from any other event held at 
the stadium, including 22.5% of any future baseball revenues. And finally, the 
city and county of Sacramento would hand over a $50-million, up-front 
"franchise fee" to Davis for being so good as to take the rest of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Oakland, long bereft of its former team, has offered the fanaticism 
of real Raiders fans plus some sweeteners. Namely, $65 million to build luxury 
boxes at the Oakland Coliseum, $22 million in guaranteed tickets sales and a 
$32-million franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles once seemed content to lose the Raiders to now-humiliated 
Irwindale. But last week the L.A. Coliseum managers apparently decided what the 
hell, they could give away money as fast as Oakland and Sacramento. They 
offered to tear down the Coliseum, build a new one for $125 million and give 
Davis $60 million over 10 years if he'll say he loves L.A. As if that wasn't 
enough, they reportedly raised the bid this week to $140 million for the 
stadium and $76 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, the L.A. bid falls into a slightly different category from the 
others. Davis is being offered those millions not to move the team, but to keep 
it exactly where it is now. In other words, nothing is being asked of the 
Raiders except to say yes. 
</P>
<P>
When the final deal is made, Davis will still own the Raiders, and the winning 
city, along with its entrepreneurs, will get to take all the financial risks. 
The situation is so skewed in favor of the Raiders' owner, so close to the 
outrageous, that Davis-bashing on a serious scale has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
Let me suggest that forces other than Davis' dark machinations may also be at 
work here. There are reasons, I think, why California just happens to be the 
spot where this phenomenon has boiled over, and why we may see more of this in 
the future, not less. 
</P>
<P>
It has to do, in part, with the boom here in California, and with a state in 
flux. We have grown rich in ways that other regions of the country have not. 
Sometimes you have to leave California to see the contrast. There's big money 
now not only in L.A. and Orange County but in once-sleepy towns like 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
And when new money comes of age, it needs to make itself felt. New money likes 
to take things from old money. Notice that the biggest, fattest offer of all 
comes from Sacramento. In part that's because Lukenbill and his crowd stand to 
make millions from the development of nearby real estate if the Raiders go 
there. It is also because the issue is more sharply felt in Sacramento, which 
has long resented its position as the stepchild of the Bay Area and now 
believes that its day is coming. 
</P>
<P>
So, in part, Davis has been the beneficiary of a change taking place in 
California. Some cities are in the ascendant while others decline, and the 
movement of sports teams, to some degree, reflects that change. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, it is likely to bring more reshuffling. The San Francisco 
Giants, the San Diego Padres, the Los Angeles Clippers all are itchy to move, 
all looking for money from the richest suitors. Where they land will help show 
us the new map of power in California.

VIDEOTAPE IS CENTERPIECE OF 'VICTORVILLE 5' BRUTALITY LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE ARREST WAS RECORDED BY A NEIGHBOR. BUT A LAWYER FOR 6 SAN 
BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES SAYS THE TAPE DOESN'T SHOW ALL THAT 
HAPPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It began on a hot summer morning in 1988, when authorities responded to a 
complaint about an all-night party in a front yard in an otherwise quiet 
Victorville neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, six San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies had used batons, 
elbows, fists and chokeholds to restrain five Mexican citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The men claimed police brutality. Deputies said their use of potentially deadly 
force was justified because one of the men pushed an officer, then grabbed for 
the guns of two deputies in a scuffle. The others, the deputies said, had tried 
to come to the man's aid. 
</P>
<P>
What no one knew is that a next-door neighbor captured part of that explosive 
confrontation on videotape. Viewings of the tape of that June 30, 1988, 
incident fueled the anger of the local Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that four-minute tape -- which appears to show several uniformed officers 
using fists and batons on men who offered little resistance -- is at the heart 
of a multimillion-dollar civil rights lawsuit being tried in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The video camera has long been a tool of law enforcement, as in the FBI's 
Abscam sting targeting U.S. congressmen in 1980. But this civil trial 
represents one of the first uses of a videotape as evidence against police in 
federal court, said Stephen Yagman, an attorney for the Mexicans, who have 
become known as the "Victorville Five." 
</P>
<P>
"We will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers mercilessly and 
viciously beat these plaintiffs, injured them, and did that with the knowledge 
that no one would ever know," Yagman told jurors in opening statements last 
week. "And even when the videotape came to light, (San Bernardino County 
Sheriff Floyd Tidwell) took out his big stamp and stamped it and said (of the 
deputies' actions) 'That's OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
But David D. Lawrence, attorney for the six deputies, contends that the 
videotape is only a partial account that fails to show the hostile behavior of 
the five men that led to the deputies' use of force. Moreover, he says, actions 
portrayed on the videotape are not what they seem. U.S. District Judge A. 
Wallace Tashima last week denied Lawrence's motion to block jurors from viewing 
the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Latino community activists, meanwhile, see the videotape as the first 
incontrovertible proof that a pattern of abuse by police exists in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference that makes this case of the Victorville Five stand out is the 
videotape," said Armando Navarro, executive director of the Institute for 
Social Justice, a San Bernardino-based civil rights group. "I've dealt for 21 
years in community activism, but I've never had something so classic, showing 
the violence in living color." 
</P>
<P>
Also monitoring the trial closely is the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles, 
which has become increasingly active in cases of alleged discrimination against 
Mexican citizens in the Southland. A representative of the consulate has sat in 
the courtroom since the trial began last week. 
</P>
<P>
The case "is extremely important," said acting Consul General Mario Nunez 
Mariel, who hopes a victory for the plaintiffs will help end what he called 
violence and discrimination against Mexican citizens by U.S. law enforcement 
officers. "We think it is the right time for stopping all kinds of abuses and 
violations of human rights of Mexican citizens in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheriff a Defendant 
</P>
<P>
The defendants in the lawsuit are Sheriff Tidwell, San Bernardino County, Sgt. 
Tim Miller, Deputies Mark Swagger, Mike Stout and Joe Lee Phillips, and Sgt. 
John Gocke, who was a deputy at the time. Also named is Deputy Paul Schmidt, 
who now works for the Nevada County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence said the suit seeks $5 million in damages for each of the five 
plaintiffs -- Jose Serrano, his father, Efren, and his brother, Victor, as well 
as friends Auro Ruiz and Javier Ruelas. 
</P>
<P>
Some elements in the case are not in dispute: The Serrano family and their two 
friends had been playing loud music and drinking beer in their front yard on 
5th Street since 9 p.m. on June 29. A neighbor complained to the Sheriff's 
Department that the men were still partying at 10 a.m. the next day and 
urinating in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that arriving deputies asked the men to take their party 
indoors, and that one deputy followed Jose Serrano into his house to persuade 
him to get the others to comply. Deputy Schmidt also did not leave the house 
despite Serrano's repeated requests to do so, until an increasingly irritated 
Serrano started out the door. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, deputies contend, Jose Serrano shoved the deputy and a struggle 
ensued. Schmidt testified that when he put his arm around Serrano's neck in an 
effort to use a "carotid control hold," he felt Serrano's hand reaching for the 
gun on Schmidt's right hip. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Phillips testified that, as Schmidt forced Serrano to the ground, 
Serrano reached forward for Phillips' gun and that he shoved Serrano's arm away 
and helped Schmidt to handcuff the still-struggling man. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the commotion, a next-door neighbor known only as "Chava" turned on his 
video camera and began recording the events through a window of his house. A 
few days later, he gave the tape to a Latino activist and is now said to be 
living in Mexico, where he cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape begins recording the action at about the time that the two 
deputies were trying to carry off the handcuffed Jose Serrano, who was 
clutching a porch railing. 
</P>
<P>
The tape -- played, rewound and replayed for jurors repeatedly last week -- 
shows Phillips yanking on a night stick under Serrano's arm. It also shows 
Phillips jamming his elbow down between Serrano's shoulder blades -- in an 
effort, the deputy testified, to release the man's grasp. At one point, 
Phillips is heard to say, "Now you're mine." 
</P>
<P>
The videotape shows other deputies who had arrived at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Deputy Swagger, swings his baton at two seated men -- Efren and 
Victor Serrano, and one blow appears to strike Efren Serrano in the head. But 
Swagger testified that he struck him in the forearm and legs in an effort to 
stop the two men, who he claimed were moving forward off a couch to try to help 
Jose Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
The tape also shows Swagger striking Jose Serrano three times while the latter 
was on the ground, handcuffed. Swagger testified that the first two blows hit 
the ground and that he only struck Serrano on the leg once to subdue him. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Swagger ordered Efren and Victor Serrano to stand, and 
another deputy ordered them to sit down. The conflicting orders were repeated 
and one of the deputies pushed the men back down on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of confusing" and demeaning, testified Mary Frances Henry, a 
neighbor who watched part of the incident from her porch across the street. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape then shows deputies dragging Jose Serrano away. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman said the Serranos and their two friends suffered cuts and bruises as a 
result of the beatings, which he described as "brutal, unprovoked" attacks. 
They were not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also noted that only one of the men was charged in the case. Those 
charges, he said, stemmed from a small amount of cocaine found in Jose 
Serrano's wallet. Yagman told jurors that while the man has pleaded guilty and 
entered a drug diversion program, Serrano denies that the cocaine was his. 
Yagman alleged that the cocaine was planted in Serrano's wallet after it was 
taken from him. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman contends that the officers had no right to enter Serrano's house without 
a warrant and that, at a minimum, they were required to leave after Serrano's 
repeated requests. Yagman also contends that the men were doing nothing illegal 
by drinking on private property and were not required to go inside as deputies 
had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
The deputies have testified that they were acting within their legal authority 
throughout the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the questioning in the trial has centered on contradictions in various 
written and recorded statements made by the deputies to their superiors and 
during pretrial depositions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, initial written statements made by the officers before the 
videotape's existence was made public by Latino activists do not mention some 
of the blows depicted on the tape. There are further discrepancies between the 
videotape and subsequent statements to Sheriff's Department internal affairs 
officers, Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the verdict of the four-man, four-woman jury in the case of the 
Victorville Five, relations between the Sheriff's Department and Latinos in San 
Bernardino County have improved dramatically since the 1988 altercation, say 
Latino activists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the videotape of the confrontation) was really the catalyst" for the 
change, said Felix G. Diaz, a Latino community leader in Victorville and member 
of the local high school district school board. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing more now than they ever did before to resolve problems of 
communication with minority communities," Diaz said, citing cultural awareness 
seminars for deputies and community members that the Sheriff's Department has 
sponsored in Victorville and elsewhere.

KOREA STUDENTS PROTEST U.S. ENVOY'S VISIT TO KWANGJU

Hundreds of radical students burned effigies of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg 
and President Roh Tae Woo on Monday in the southern city of Kwangju to protest 
the envoy's visit, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate group of 100 protesters threw human excrement and tear gas powder at 
a police station near the U.S. Cultural Center residence that Gregg visited, 
the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg, who apparently did not see the protests, was the first U.S. ambassador 
to visit the city since a 1980 civil uprising in which 200 civilians were 
reported killed and 1,500 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Many Kwangju citizens believe Washington condoned the mobilization of the 
Korean military to put down unrest and silence dissent. Washington has denied 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 radical students yelling anti-American slogans battled 900 riot 
police with firebombs and rocks at Kwangju's Chosun University, said Yonhap, 
the South Korean news agency. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting continued for an hour inside the campus after police moved in 
to break up a rally, Yonhap and newspapers reported. The troopers were 
supported by two armored vehicles firing tear gas, the reports said. No 
injuries or arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Gregg came here under a scheme with Roh Tae Woo trying to unilaterally shelve 
the Kwangju issue," Yonhap quoted a student leader at the rally as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Police have been on alert since the ambassador arrived Sunday for a three-day 
visit. News reports said he was protected by plainclothes officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hankook Ilbo, a Seoul daily, said police had advised against Gregg's visit, 
but U.S. officials said an explanation of Washington's role in Kwangju should 
be resolved through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here not to make an apology but to express regret and condolences to 
Kwangju citizens," Gregg said Monday, according to news reports. He also denied 
any U.S. involvement in putting down the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said the United States urged the South Korean government in 1980 to 
settle the protests in Kwangju peacefully, "but our influence was not enough 
over the South Korean government," Yonhap said.

Azerbaijanis demanding free contacts with fellow Muslims across the border have 
spread their protests to the Soviet-Turkish frontier, destroying border 
fortifications, the government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Communist Party officials met with 
Azerbaijani activists in an attempt to find solutions to the ethnic, 
nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist problems racking the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Rafik Neshanev, chairman of the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet, 
was present at the discussions during which, Tass said, "many speeches sharply 
criticized the Communist Party of the country and the government's Council of 
Ministers." 
</P>
<P>
Shiite Muslim Azerbaijanis from Nakichevan province, who have destroyed 120 
miles of fortifications on the frontier with Iran, streamed toward a bridge 
over the Aras River at the frontier with Turkey on Sunday and gave guards an 
ultimatum to let them pass, Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation became explosive, and the soldiers decided to let them pass to 
avoid the bloodshed," it said. "A minute later, the fortifications along about 
one-eighth of a mile of the frontier with Turkey were destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters want freedom to travel across the border to visit fellow ethnic 
Azerbaijanis in the Iranian region of the same name. They also want the right 
to freely cultivate land along the border, which is in a fertile valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sunday's incident involved only a small portion of the southern 
border, it was the last remnant of Nakichevan's southern frontier with Iran and 
Turkey that had not been battered down by the Muslim Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
In ethnic strife elsewhere in Azerbaijan, presumed Azerbaijani nationalists 
blew up two main transport bridges at the edge of Nagorno-Karabakh, cutting 
supplies to the embattled Armenian-dominated enclave, the official Tass news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident appeared to be an attempt to reimpose a blockade by Azerbaijanis 
trying to compel Armenians to drop their claims to the enclave. More than 200 
people have died in nearly two years of strife over the enclave.

E. GERMAN TALKS STALL OVER SECRET POLICE ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: THE STASI ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DISBANDED. BUT OPPOSITION LEADERS 
SAY MOST ARE STILL AT THEIR POSTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
East German opposition leaders threatened Monday to break off political talks 
with the Communists after rejecting assurances that the hated secret police 
have been disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition insisted that most of the secret police, the Stasi, are still at 
their posts around the nation even though the Communist government said two 
months ago that it would abolish the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders called on Prime Minister Hans Modrow to promise that the 
secret police will be disarmed and disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition took its stand at the weekly meeting of the so-called round 
table, an assembly of Communist leaders and opposition groups. The round table 
was established to work out procedures in advance of national elections 
scheduled for May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Modrow can provide firm assurances that the secret police are being 
broken up, the opposition said, it will refuse to attend next week's meeting 
and will call for nationwide demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Kueppe, a representative of New Forum, the largest of the opposition 
movements, said she has not been convinced by government assurances that the 
secret police will be abolished before the May elections and not be replaced by 
any similar organization. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the opposition said in a joint statement that it "protests 
energetically against the behavior of the government." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, about 100,000 people marched Monday through Leipzig 
chanting "Down with Communists" and calling for German reunification, news 
agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rally said they fear a resurgence of Communist power and 
believe that the Stasi are still active. Leipzig has been the scene of regular 
rallies for months. Monday's was the first of the new year after a 
Christmas-season break. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Koch, a government official who has been involved in the move to disband 
the secret police, said all the agency's personnel have turned in their 
weapons. He said these "have been secured" and that "any access to them by 
security police is out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Koch said that 25,000 of the secret police agency's employees have been 
dismissed and that its network of informers has been dissolved. He admitted, 
however, that 60,000 people are still working for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We are only at the beginning of the process of disbanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolf Henrich of New Forum suggested that Koch should not accept secret police 
promises that their weapons were turned in. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not dealing with a girls' boarding school," he said. "You have to be 
naive to think this organization will show any interest in its own breakup." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Konrad Weiss, a leader of the opposition group 
Democracy Now, told the West German newspaper Bild that the Communist regime is 
only now calling attention to neo-Nazi activity in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The movement has existed for years, Weiss said, but the Communists have sought 
to minimize this fact in order to avoid embarrassment. "Neo-Nazis in East 
Germany didn't fit in with the pretty facade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said there are as many as 1,500 neo-Nazis in East Germany, many of them 
members of the secret police. He said the Communist regime is playing up 
neo-Nazism now as a way of suggesting that the secret police are still needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to give the impression," Weiss said, "that there have been 
neo-Nazis only since the Stasi went, but they were around before." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, East German border guards turned back Franz Schoenhuber, leader of 
West Germany's far-right Republicans party, when he tried to cross from West 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber's Republicans have announced plans to establish a branch of the 
party in East Germany and to make German reunification their major objective. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber, a member of an SS formation in World War II, said that his being 
refused entry is "scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
"It shows how afraid this collapsing state is," he said, "in the face of the 
authentic anti-Communist alternative -- the only one so far -- that the 
Republicans represent."

A homemade projectile fired from a car landed near the home of Emperor 
Akihito's younger brother in Tokyo on Monday, and another such object was found 
near the imperial garden in Kyoto, police said. No injuries or damage were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspect leftist radicals opposed to the monarchy in the attacks, which 
took place at about the same time in Tokyo and Kyoto. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks came the same day a commission was formed to plan Akihito's formal 
coronation, and a day after the end of a one-year mourning period for his 
father, Emperor Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials in Tokyo said at least one projectile was fired from a car 
parked 650 feet from the western Tokyo residence of Prince Hitachi, Akihito's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
One projectile was found in a road and a fragment, possibly from a second 
missile, was discovered in the yard of a private home near Hitachi's home, the 
officials said. The projectile contained no explosives, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In the western city of Kyoto, one homemade projectile was found near the gate 
of the imperial garden, police said. Witnesses reported hearing three 
explosions.

to help reduce obstacles to a new U.S.-Soviet strategic arms treaty, 
Administration officials said. The trip to Moscow is one of three sessions 
Baker intends to hold with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
before a U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington in June. Baker also may visit Prague 
to demonstrate U.S. support for the peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia, 
officials said.

Defense Minister Tie Banh of Cambodia admits that government forces have been 
forced to abandon a number of areas in western Cambodia after attacks by a 
coalition of three guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
Tie Banh's remarks, broadcast by Cambodian government radio over the weekend, 
came after the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group announced that it had attacked 
Battambang, the country's No. 2 city, on Saturday and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Tie Banh did not refer directly to the rebel announcement, but Chum Bun Rong, a 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Phnom Penh, denied Monday that the city 
was on fire or even threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"There were small night attacks in Battambang province," he told United Press 
International, "but everything in the provincial capital is normal." 
</P>
<P>
In his radio remarks, Tie Banh said: "I would like to inform all the comrades 
that the enemies have been gradually advancing in their attacks against a 
number of our positions along the border. To be sincere, we have lost some 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
Tie Banh said that some areas are being abandoned as a strategic ploy so that 
more important areas can be defended. "The main thing for us now," he said, "is 
to defend at all costs the townships, major communications networks and a 
number of passes." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the impact on morale of the rebel claims about Battambang, Tie 
Banh said that while the rebels had carried out only limited military 
activities, "they have constantly boasted about them, (and) this is very 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a reporter if the opposition could bring down the government, Tie Banh 
expressed confidence that the government will survive and added: "Whether the 
enemies can topple us or not depends on us. If we are willing to let them come 
easily, then they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Tie Banh's remarks were among the gloomiest since Vietnam withdrew the last of 
its troops from Cambodia in September. He acknowledged that the rebel offensive 
came at a time when the government was not fully prepared to replace the 
Vietnamese troops with Cambodian troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three months, the Khmer Rouge has been pressing northeast from the 
gem-mining town of Pailin, which fell in October, toward Battambang, while the 
two non-Communist partners in the rebel coalition have moved gradually into 
northwestern Cambodia along an arc that follows Route 69 near the border. These 
troops are slowly closing in on another provincial capital, Sisophon. 
</P>
<P>
Tie Banh noted that most of the abandoned areas are along the Thai border. He 
said rebel forces based across the border in Thailand have short lines of 
communications, while the government must move men and supplies over relatively 
long distances. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Khmer Rouge cannot hold territory for long because of Cambodian 
revulsion at their methods. In five years of Khmer Rouge rule, from 1975 to 
1979, more than 1 million Cambodians were said to have died of starvation and 
mistreatment.

Mayor Marion Barry refused Monday to confirm or deny that he told a reporter 
that the Rev. Jesse Jackson would be "the laughingstock of America" if he 
challenged him for mayor of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy profile published Sunday, the Los Angeles Times quoted Barry as 
saying Jackson "don't wanna run nothing but his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also was quoted as saying that Jackson would be "run outta town if he 
ran against me." 
</P>
<P>
The embattled Barry is expected to formally announce his candidacy this month 
for a fourth term. After a news conference Monday to announce that his popular 
commissioner of public health had resigned, Barry refused to confirm or deny 
The Times' story. He earlier had denied making the statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the process of reading the article," Barry said Monday. "I have not 
read it fully yet. It's a rather long article. After I read it I will put 
together a very definitive reaction to it. I more than likely will send that to 
the Los Angeles Times."

COURT GETS CASES THAT COULD LET IT CURB AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN FEDERAL CONTRACTS 
</P>

The Supreme Court, entering the affirmative action fray again, said Monday it 
would decide whether the federal government may give blacks, Latinos or women 
special preferences in the awarding of licenses or contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the court's conservative majority put strict new limits on the use 
of affirmative action in the awarding of city and state contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the "extreme" instance, when it can be shown that minority members and 
women had been excluded in the past from getting contracts, may a city or state 
take race or sex into account in awarding new contracts, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Because most minority-preference programs were undertaken to combat "societal 
discrimination," not because of a clearly documented history of exclusion, 
hundreds of such city and state plans were suddenly made vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the court's conservatives have an opportunity to put the same strict 
limits on affirmative action in federal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In two related cases, the court will consider whether the Federal 
Communications Commission may foster "diversity" in the broadcast industry by 
giving preferences to applicants for radio or TV licenses whose ownership 
groups include blacks, women or Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In another broadcast-related case, the high court said that it will not 
consider whether the FCC must require broadcasters to present all sides of 
controversial issues. Instead, without comment or dissent, the justices allowed 
the so-called "fairness doctrine" to lapse quietly by refusing to hear an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, congressional Democrats have sought to write the 
fairness doctrine into law, but they have been blocked by the Republican White 
House. President Ronald Reagan vetoed one fairness doctrine bill as an 
infringement on the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, and President Bush 
said last year he will do the same if a new bill comes to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Reagan appointees, the FCC dropped the fairness doctrine regulations in 
1987 as part of an effort to deregulate broadcasting. The doctrine was not 
required by law, the FCC lawyers said. Moreover, even if it were written into 
law, it would violate the free press rights of broadcasters, they said. 
</P>
<P>
This action was a sharp break with prior broadcast regulation and created a 
fundamentally new view of the First Amendment and broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
The fairness doctrine regulations dated to 1949, when radio was dominant and 
only 51 TV stations were operating nationwide. As a condition of holding a 
license, broadcasters were required to cover public controversies and to give 
fair treatment to all sides. 
</P>
<P>
In the landmark Red Lion Broadcasting case of 1969, the Supreme Court 
unanimously upheld the fairness doctrine against a First Amendment challenge by 
broadcasters. Because broadcast frequencies are in short supply, broadcasters 
may be regulated in the public interest, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the 1980s, Reagan Administration lawyers sought to overturn that view. 
Because of the rapid growth in radio and TV outlets, particularly in cable 
broadcasting, the fairness doctrine was no longer needed or justified, they 
said. Now, broadcasters would be given the same First Amendment rights as 
newspaper publishers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of public interest groups challenged this view and sought a test case. 
One arose when a Syracuse, N. Y., television station refused to air a reply to 
advertisements promoting nuclear power. In response to a complaint from the 
Syracuse Peace Council, the FCC said that the fairness doctrine was not 
required by federal law, so the station had no obligation to air the 
conflicting view. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Media Access Project, a Ralph-Nader affiliated public interest 
group, appealed to the high court, urging the justices to consider whether the 
fairness doctrine is required by law. But, without comment, the appeal was 
rejected. (Syracuse Peace Council vs FCC, 89-312.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the affirmative action cases that the high court will hear also pit 
congressional Democrats against the Republican White House. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic-sponsored legislation has required that many federal contract 
programs give favorable or special treatment to blacks, Latinos and members of 
other minorities as a remedy for past discrimination. But the White House, 
particularly in the Reagan Administration, believed such preferences violated 
the equal-treatment guarantee in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when Reagan appointees at the FCC sought to revoke preferential 
treatment for minority members, Congress quickly passed legislation forbidding 
any changes. The Supreme Court now must settle the dispute between the 
legislative and executive branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
Two distinct programs are at issue. When two companies compete for a broadcast 
license, the FCC gives extra points to firms whose ownership groups include 
minority members or women. Earlier this year, an appeals court here upheld that 
program on a 2-1 vote because race was "only one of several factors" used in 
making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
However, another panel of the same appeals court, also on a 2-1 vote, struck 
down the FCC's so-called "distress sale" program, which allows broadcasters 
facing license revocations to recoup most of their investment by selling their 
licenses to a minority firm. 
</P>
<P>
The cases of Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC, 89-453, and Astroline Communications 
vs. Shurberg, 89-700, will be heard in March. A ruling can be expected by July. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed Monday to revisit a controversial policy of the Reagan 
Administration and to decide whether state governors may block their National 
Guard units from being sent on "training missions" in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Pentagon dispatched a number of National Guard units to Honduras 
to help out in road-building projects. Prominent Democratic governors said they 
would not consent to sending their state Guard units on such missions. In 
response, Congress quickly passed new legislation, signed by President Reagan, 
that said governors may not block such Pentagon moves. In their appeal to the 
Supreme Court, the governors say this legislation is unconstitutional. (Perpich 
vs. Dept. of Defense, 89-542.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said that Oregon may impose a tax on airplanes that fly over the state, 
even if they never touch ground there. Oregon taxes airlines that operate in 
the state but also figures in its taxing formula the amount of time planes are 
flying over the state. Lawyers for Alaska Airlines and USAir complained that 
Oregon "has erected a toll booth at 35,000 feet," but the high court upheld the 
state tax without comment. (Alaska Airlines vs. Oregon, 89-346.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a federal appeals court ruling that threw out a $9.4-million 
award to the family of a woman whose husband hired her killer through an ad in 
Soldier of Fortune magazine. (Eimann vs. Soldier of Fortune, 89-790.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upheld a $100,000 fine against Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. because one 
of its Midwest executives engaged in "block booking," the practice of forcing 
theater owners to run a less popular film as a condition of getting a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, the Hollywood studios signed a consent decree with the Justice 
Department forbidding this practice. (Twentieth Century Fox vs. U.S., 89-661.)

<P>
Storms on Monday brought heavy rains and 100-m.p.h. winds to the Northwest. 
Utility lines were ripped down, houses were smashed and fallen trees and 
rockslides blocked highways. 
</P>
<P>
Gusts up to 107 m.p.h. toppled nearly 100 trees and ripped off roofs on the 
Washington State University campus at Pullman, near the Idaho border. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Spoonemore, the university's physical plant director, said the wind 
broke windows in a dozen buildings and blew the roofs off several others, 
including a dormitory, but most students were off campus for winter break. He 
estimated the damage at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon coastal communities shuddered in gusts up to 76 m.p.h. early Monday and 
were braced for a third windstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Utility crews scrambled to remove tree limbs from power lines and replace 
toppled poles in much of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Winds of up to 70 m.p.h. also swooped down the Columbia Gorge, knocked out 
electricity and phone service in the Tri-Cities region of southern Washington 
and, farther east, in border areas from Spokane, Wash., south to Lewiston, Ida.

<P>
Ron Kovic, the paraplegic Vietnam veteran whose life story is told in the 
current film "Born on the Fourth of July," appealed to residents in Rep. Robert 
Dornan's congressional district to help him decide whether he should run for 
the office. Kovic said in interviews that he is "ready to serve my country 
again, but I cannot make this decision alone. 
</P>
<P>
I am asking people to write me, to call me, to come up to me on the street. I'm 
not a professional politician. If I ran it would be as a 
citizen-representative, an everyday person." Kovic said he will make a decision 
by the end of February when he returns from a film festival in Europe. Several 
national Democratic leaders have urged him to run against Dornan in the 38th 
Congressional District in Orange County. Dornan criticized Kovic's call for 
more U.S. support of changes in the Soviet Union and a "perestroika in 
America." "My hope for the future is a future without the communism that put 
Ron Kovic in a wheelchair," Dornan said.

HOLLYWOOD: BUCHWALD'S TENTATIVE VICTORY MAY LEAD TO SOME PROCEDURAL TIGHTENING 
UP, BUT THE ISSUES IN THE DISPUTE ARE NOTHING NEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Art Buchwald's legal bout with Paramount Pictures will probably be remembered 
more for its marquee value than for any serious impact on the way Hollywood 
does business. 
</P>
<P>
Agents and production executives said Monday that Buchwald's tentative victory 
in his suit claiming authorship of the idea for Eddie Murphy's hit film "Coming 
to America" may lead to some tightening of the already complex procedures by 
which production companies review and purchase ideas. 
</P>
<P>
But it does not appear to have introduced major new concerns. The issues in the 
Buchwald-Paramount dispute have been faced in previous court cases and union 
arbitrations, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
"The finding for Art Buchwald will make people examine their practices even 
more closely," said David Friendly, a production executive with Imagine Films 
Entertainment, which has a film production deal with Universal Pictures. 
"Keeping track of the idea is part of our job. We're incredibly careful about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Disputes over authorship, one of Hollywood's more nettlesome perennial 
problems, are usually resolved in arbitration proceedings conducted by the 
Writers Guild of America. The guild reviews about 300 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arbitration procedures, however, virtually every major studio has 
faced authorship suits -- although most receive far less publicity than 
Buchwald's dispute with Paramount. Buchwald did not request a guild arbitration 
but is a member of the guild's East Coast affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Pictures, for example, is defending itself against a suit in which 
writer Martyn Burke has sought damages in excess of $10 million. Burke has 
claimed that the studio based its film "Good Morning, Vietnam" on material 
misappropriated from a project based on his novel, "The Laughing War." Disney 
has denied the charge, and the suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
One Universal executive said his studio has faced as many as seven such suits 
at a time during recent years, and it was particularly plagued by people who 
claimed authorship of "E.T., the Extra-Terrestial," a 1982 hit directed and 
produced by Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment for a time tried to prevent such claims by 
requiring anyone who submitted an idea or script material to sign a release 
waiving the right to sue. It dropped the practice about a year ago, however. 
</P>
<P>
One studio chief, who declined to be named, said the most unusual feature of 
the Buchwald case was that Paramount did not settle out of court. 
</P>
<P>
"Juries tend to find against studios. When your lawyers think a case has any 
merit at all, they'll usually tell you to settle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A top talent agent, who also declined to be identified, said the court's 
decision would probably increase the level of "paranoia" that surrounds major 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
"There was incredibly sloppy work around Eddie," the agent said, pointing to 
Murphy's embarrassing admission in a deposition that he was familiar with 
Buchwald's story idea. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine's Friendly said the level of concern about misappropriating ideas is 
such that some executives will stop a story proposal meeting, rather than 
listen to ideas that might be close to a screenplay already being developed. 
</P>
<P>
"You interrupt and say, 'I can't even hear this,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Sobel, who edits the Entertainment Law Reporter and served as co-counsel 
to Paramount in the case, said such authorship disputes are "very common." But 
most lawsuits on such matters are filed by individuals who, unlike Buchwald, 
never had a contract with the studio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, working relationships that bind the tight-knit show business community 
appear to disarm many disputes before they reach court or an arbitration panel. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pretty cautious. You deal through agents, and with the same 
executives over and over again," said James Berkus, president of the Leading 
Artists talent agency. "I've never had anyone steal from one of my clients."

SOME ALTERNATIVES OFFERED TO EASE SCHOOL CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Los Angeles school officials heading for a showdown over putting more 
schools on a year-round calendar, Board of Education member Mark Slavkin on 
Monday offered a package of alternative ways to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin's 12-point package ranges from seeking help from the Legislature and 
California voters to using school administrative offices for classrooms and 
even leasing unused schools from surrounding districts. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the district "cannot go it alone," Slavkin called for greater 
cooperation with local governments in ensuring there will be enough schools. He 
proposed a cities/schools task force to review existing law and make 
recommendations for changes. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested putting schools on the sites of large corporations and 
opening the campuses to children of employees and those in surrounding 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Other large districts -- including the one in Dade County, Fla. -- already are 
operating similar work-site schools. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Slavkin's proposals, such as reopening schools closed years ago when 
area enrollments declined, are already under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as asking the governor and the Legislature to place a school bond 
measure on the June ballot and persuading California voters to loosen 
requirements for approval of local bond measures, are beyond the school board's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Slavkin said he felt it was important to offer his ideas before 
the board takes action, tentatively scheduled for Feb. 5, on a series of 
measures aimed at increasing capacity in the burgeoning Los Angeles Unified 
School District by 23% by 1993. The district added about 15,000 students this 
year, boosting enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grades to 610,149. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most controversial of the capacity-increasing methods is a proposal 
to put more -- or even all -- of the district's more than 600 schools on a 
year-round calendar. That proposal is generating the most controversy on the 
Westside -- which Slavkin represents -- and parts of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Slavkin said Monday his proposals should not be taken as a signal that he 
opposes operating more schools throughout the year as a way to relieve 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to accommodate as many students as possible in the areas in which they 
live," Slavkin said, "and that doesn't rule out more year-round schools. . . . 
But we need to be more creative about providing additional facilities." 
</P>
<P>
In the inner city and on the Eastside, parents have complained that their 
children have borne the brunt of the overcrowding crisis because they are the 
ones who have had to endure long bus rides to suburban schools. Some of their 
schools have been on year-round calendars for several years. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with board policy, Slavkin's proposals were not debated Monday but 
were sent to a committee and scheduled for discussion by the full board 
beginning Jan. 29.

LEADER OF CULT STASHED ARMS IN DECEMBER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A SELF-STORAGE LOCKER RENTED LAST MONTH IN CHULA VISTA CONTAINED GUNS 
AND AMMUNITION BELONGING TO JEFFREY D. LUNDGREN, WHO WAS ARRESTED SUNDAY IN THE 
RITUALISTIC SLAYINGS OF AN OHIO FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of a religious cult, arrested Sunday at a National City motel in the 
ritualistic slayings of an Ohio family, had been in Chula Vista in mid-December 
to cache guns, ammunition and paramilitary gear, authorities learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While police combed Southern California on Monday for the two remaining 
fugitives indicted in the killings, law enforcement authorities nationwide were 
left to speculate why defrocked minister Jeffrey D. Lundgren -- and his 
entourage -- came to the San Diego region, how long they had been in the area 
and what they intended to do with the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for an extradition hearing today, prosecutors' leading theory was 
that Lundgren, his wife and family were preparing to flee to Mexico to evade 
police. But they also were studying the "rumor" that Lundgren experienced a 
"vision" that told him to go to Mexico, said Steven C. LaTourette, a Lake 
County, Ohio, prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents coordinating the nationwide search that led to Lundgren's arrest 
said they had "no direct ties" linking him to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to determine why he came here," said April Freud, a 
spokeswoman at the San Diego office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents confirmed only that Lundgren had rented a self-storage locker 
Dec. 17 in Chula Vista and had filled it with weapons, ammunition and 
military-style gear, Freud said. When agents searched the locker late Sunday 
afternoon, they found a handgun, two rifles, a shotgun, explosive powder, 
hundreds of rounds of ammunition, a fire ax and gas masks, Freud said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, when ATF agents and National City police arrested Lundgren, 39, 
a defrocked minister of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
Saints, they found four guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, gas 
masks and canteens at his Santa Fe Motel room. 
</P>
<P>
At the motel, agents also arrested Lundgren's wife, Alice; his oldest son, 
19-year-old Damon P. Lundgren, and took temporary custody of three of the 
couple's younger children. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, his wife and oldest son refused extradition Monday and were being 
held at San Diego County jails, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Hewicker said. Charges 
for the father and son included five counts of aggravated murder with Ohio's 
death-penalty specifications, prosecutor LaTourette said. 
</P>
<P>
The three younger children -- Jason, 15; Kristen, 10, and Jason, 9 -- were in 
"safe hands" in San Diego, Freud said, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests Sunday left police seeking only two of the 13 cult members indicted 
in Ohio in the killings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three young 
daughters, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Renee Johnson, 36, and Daniel David Kraft, 25, last seen Saturday in 
San Diego, were believed to be driving a light blue 1986 Nissan pickup truck, 
Freud said. The vehicle has a silver camper top, a dented front fender and 
either Ohio or Missouri license plates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We still anticipate them to be in the Southern California area," Freud said. 
It is "highly probable" that the pair is "armed and dangerous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the Averys -- Dennis, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42, and their 
daughters, Trina, 13; Rebecca, 9, and Karen, 5 -- were found last week buried 
in a barn near Kirtland, Ohio, which is near Cleveland. The faces, heads and 
feet of all five were bound with duct tape, and each had been shot at least 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Averys were identified as one-time followers of Lundgren, who had declared 
himself the "prophet" of his own religion after his 1988 break with the church. 
</P>
<P>
The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is not related to 
the larger Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints based in Salt Lake City, 
although both groups base their beliefs on the Book of Mormon and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, investigators believe the Averys were 
killed last April in a sacrifice performed so that the rest of Lundgren's group 
could travel to the wilderness, where they could be cleansed and search for a 
"golden sword." 
</P>
<P>
The killings were not discovered until an informer mentioned them on New Year's 
Eve, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Averys were killed with a .45-caliber handgun, and prosecutor LaTourette 
said he was hoping that the murder weapon would turn up in the Chula Vista 
storage locker. The locker, however, yielded a 9-millimeter handgun, two 
semiautomatic rifles and a shotgun, Freud said. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a .45-caliber handgun at the motel room. Freud said it, like 
the other weapons, would be sent to an ATF laboratory in San Francisco for 
ballistics and fingerprint tests, but authorities could not yet identify it as 
the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred during a one-hour period sometime between April 16 and 18 
on a farm owned by the 29-member cult, which lived communally. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the group left the house hurriedly in mid-April, leaving behind 
chickens and rabbits. They became somewhat nomadic, authorities said, traveling 
first to West Virginia, then to southwestern Missouri, then to the suburbs of 
Kansas City and Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, when seven members of the cult were arrested in Kansas City, Mo., 
law enforcement officials in nine states had been searching for Lundgren and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren rented a 5-by-4-foot locker at Security First Self Storage in Chula 
Vista on Dec. 17, paying $56 for two months' rent at $28 a month, manager Doug 
Reed said. The contents were moved between 1:55 and 2:45 p.m. the next day, 
Dec. 18, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Records do not indicate any further visits to the locker, Reed said, adding 
that he would not have allowed weapons to be moved in if he had known about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
He said he "couldn't believe it" when agents removed guns and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"They just seemed like average, everyday people," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Dec. 17 rental, police had "reason to believe (Lundgren) has 
been in the area for approximately a month," Freud said. That suspicion has not 
been confirmed, though, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added, "It's sheer speculation as to where they came from or how they got 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The Lundgren family checked in last Wednesday night at the Santa Fe Motel under 
a bogus name, motel managers said. The room, at $37.80 a night, had been paid 
for through today, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Kraft may have visited, because "we were told that at one time 
eight people were in that room," Freud said. "But we don't know whether those 
people were visiting or staying overnight. And we don't know the identity of 
those other people for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven members of the cult arrested in Kansas City have waived 
extradition to Ohio, LaTourette said Monday. He said he is heading to Missouri 
today to discuss the other two cases. 
</P>
<P>
An eighth member, Sharon Blunchly, waived extradition Monday in Bay City, 
Mich., LaTourette said. 
</P>
<P>
Because his Ohio county of about 220,000 people averages one murder case a 
year, the 17 prosecutors on his staff and the county's defense lawyers were 
"scrambling" to figure out how to handle the Avery cases, LaTourette said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to take a look at how to facilitate these prosecutions," 
he said.

MAN WHO STOLE $651,000 WANTS TO SURRENDER IN L.A., LETTER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HE CLAIMS TO HAVE GAMBLED AWAY THE MONEY. LETTER AND PHOTO SENT TO 
DELAWARE PAPER ARE BELIEVED TO BE AUTHENTIC.

<P>
A man on the run for two years after allegedly robbing an armored car in 
Philadelphia of $651,000 in cash says he has gambled the money away and wants 
to surrender in Los Angeles, according to a letter he is believed to have 
written. 
</P>
<P>
"I stole the money because I thought I could quadruple it through gambling -- 
and then I would give half to the company I stole it from," said the letter, 
apparently penned by Edward Leigh Hunt Jr., who was a guard on the armored car. 
</P>
<P>
"I used my gambling system, but I lost it all," the letter, postmarked in 
Inglewood, continued. "I will turn myself in to the police on Jan. 20, 1990, at 
noon at the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. . . . I'm saying, 'Yes . . . I did 
it . . . I screwed up . . . I'm sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
Editors at the Wilmington News Journal in Wilmington, Del. -- the newspaper 
that received the letter dated Dec. 20, 1989 -- said Monday that people 
familiar with Hunt identified the handwriting as his. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old fugitive's father, Edward Leigh Hunt Sr., a former Delaware 
prosecutor, said a photograph enclosed with the letter that shows an 
athletic-looking young man climbing out of a swimming pool is "definitely" a 
picture of his son. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned at this point, they both look valid -- the letter 
and the photo," said FBI Agent John Kundts, a spokesman for the bureau's office 
in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials in Los Angeles declined to comment on the case, other than to say 
that "we're still looking for him." 
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that the younger Hunt -- a Wilmington resident described by 
his father as a "near-genius" with an undergraduate degree in psychology -- 
arrived in the Los Angeles area a few days after the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
His whereabouts since then have remained a mystery, although he alluded in his 
letter to "an incredible adventure . . . in three countries." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce said Monday that they had 
"no idea" why the fugitive would want to surrender at their office. 
</P>
<P>
"And the 20th is a Saturday," said Susan Pasternak, a spokeswoman for the 
organization. "We're normally closed on Saturdays." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the letter noted, Jan. 20 is the second anniversary of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, 1988, Hunt was working as a guard for Brooks Armored Car Co. in 
Philadelphia, according to the FBI. Working with him on a truck that day were 
another guard, Martin Moran, and a driver, Robert Twaddle. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that, when the truck stopped at the main office of a downtown bank, 
Hunt remained in the vehicle while the other two went inside. When Moran and 
Twaddle returned about half an hour later, Hunt and two bulky canvas bags -- 
one containing about $250,000, the other about $400,000, all of it in used 
bills -- were missing. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars were left behind, along with Hunt's uniform jacket, his 
unloaded .38-caliber revolver and a ski mask. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's father, who served as a deputy attorney general in Delaware from 1973 to 
1975, said at the time that he thought his son was innocent of wrongdoing, "but 
if he did do it, it will be very difficult to catch him because there's no way 
he'll make the usual mistakes that get most people caught. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He's brilliant, and if he was going to rob an armored car, he'd do a good job 
of it," his father said. "He would have thought out every possible angle." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week after the robbery, Dave Graham, a Delaware resident who is a 
longtime friend of Edward Hunt Jr., called the FBI to report that he had just 
received a phone call from the fugitive. Graham said the young man told him he 
was calling from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The fugitive's father said Graham told him his son "sounded very apprehensive, 
like he was on a high, but from nervousness, not as if he were intoxicated." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The content of the call was very shallow," the elder Hunt said. "My son 
made a comment to Dave: 'Have you heard about it, or did you read about it in 
the newspapers?' Really, not much of any substance was said." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, on Jan. 29, 1988, a federal arrest warrant was issued for 
Edward Hunt Jr. Three months after that, on April 26, 1988, the young man was 
indicted by a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 20 months, nothing more was heard from the fugitive. Then, about 
two weeks ago, the newspaper in Wilmington received the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good story for your newspaper," the letter began. "I am one of the 
most wanted criminals in the United States. On Jan. 20, 1988, I stole $651,000 
from an armored truck in Philadelphia. For this crime I was featured twice on 
the national TV show, 'America's Most Wanted.' " 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he wanted to surrender in Los Angeles, the writer stressed that "my 
record was clean until that day -- not even a traffic ticket. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My father is a lawyer, my mother a first-grade teacher," the letter said. "We 
are a close family and haven't seen each other since the crime. . . . My 
girlfriend, Ellie, and I are in love. I told her the loot was an inheritance, 
so she doesn't know the truth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I am a strong believer in nonviolence; when I took the loot there was nobody 
around," the writer said. "I taught myself Spanish, and I will be a private 
Spanish teacher after jail. So I have a bright future. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry about the crime and I beg forgiveness. . . ." 
</P>

COUNCIL OKS RESIGNATIONS, DELAYS PORT REPLACEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the objections of the mayor, San Diego City Council on Monday accepted the 
resignations of two veteran port commissioners, but put off for two weeks the 
politically volatile issues of naming replacements and seeking the ouster of 
recalcitrant commissioner W. Daniel Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Mayor Maureen O'Connor vowed not to support any nominee to 
the Board of Port Commissioners, because, she said, new commissioners should be 
elected officials rather than political appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the 1962 state law that created the San Diego Unified Port District 
obsolete, the mayor said the city should push for changes to abolish political 
appointees on the powerful seven-member board and to give San Diego a majority 
on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The city has three commissioners and the cities of National City, Coronado, 
Chula Vista and Imperial Beach each have one, a condition O'Connor called 
unfair because San Diego has by far the most people. 
</P>
<P>
Although her sentiment about the need for fundamental change seemed to win 
favor from the rest of the City Council, it was, on this day, the solitary item 
of unanimity about the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
A council majority led by Bob Filner pushed through a vote to accept the 
resignations of Port Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer and Bill Rick, effective 
Feb. 7, and set Jan. 22 as the date to appoint new commissioners. Both 
Wolfsheimer and Rick had offered to stay on temporarily until the new 
Convention Center is finished and an expected lawsuit by the center's general 
contractor against the Port District is dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The majority -- consisting of Filner, Wes Pratt, John Hartley, Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, Judy McCarty and Linda Bernhardt -- also called on the council's 
Rules Commission to analyze and make recommendations on changes to the Port 
Act, such as electing representatives. Any changes would require action by the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the majority delayed until Jan. 22 the question of whether to replace 
Larsen, who has angered several council members by reneging on his promise to 
vote for renaming the Convention Center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who was reappointed to a four-year term last year, has said he will not 
step down, even if the council unanimously moves for his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the vote, Filner, who along with Pratt and Hartley has publicly 
campaigned to recall Larsen, asked City Atty. John Witt to furnish the council 
by Jan. 22 with a written opinion about the council's power to remove Larsen, 
although he never mentioned Larsen by name. 
</P>
<P>
Witt has consistently advised council members that they lack the authority to 
recall Larsen without demonstrating malfeasance on Larsen's part. 
</P>
<P>
Although part of the debate included glowing kudos for the work Rick and 
Wolfsheimer have done as commissioners over the years, another part was 
punctuated with a venom-laced exchange between Filner and the mayor that 
surprised even City Hall veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor suggested that all nominees for the Board of Port Commissioners face 
a rigorous conflict-of-interest test. Filner, his voice rising and cracking 
with anger, responded by saying that no one has yet been officially nominated 
and that, by bringing up conflict-of-interest questions now, the mayor was 
"slurring" the reputations of those who will be nominated. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor denied the accusation and tried to cut Filner off, but Filner wouldn't 
be stopped. He told the mayor that, if she is interested in having a 
conflict-of-interest policy, then it should be applied to the range of agencies 
with City Council appointees, such as the Centre City Development Corp.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR WANTS TO CHANGE PLEA IN ACUPUNCTURE 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for a former state acupuncture official who pleaded no contest to 
taking bribes in exchange for helping others pass licensing exams say that Chae 
Woo Lew now wants to change his plea to not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended in Los Angeles County Superior Court that Lew, 53, a San 
Mateo acupuncturist, was paid at least $500,000 to rig the state licensing exam 
from 1982 until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Lew's no-contest pleas to two bribery-related conspiracy 
counts, prosecutors had dropped 56 bribery charges, according to the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Lew's new lawyer, Ezekiel Perlo, said: "There is some question as to whether 
Dr. Lew understood the intricacies of the case." A hearing on a motion to 
retract the original pleas is set for Jan. 26. Lew's bail was increased last 
week to $100,000.

GINGER BROWN DEFENSE BUOYED AS JURORS ASK COURT TO REREAD SOME TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista Superior Court jury finished its second day of deliberations in the 
Ginger Brown deprogramming trial after asking the court reporter Monday to 
reread several pieces of testimony by defense witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they were unsure whether the jurors' questions bode well 
for their case, but one of them, Herb Weston, noted, "They're looking at our 
defense, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
The nature of the jurors' questions suggested that the panel may be wondering 
how compelled Earle and Dorothy Brown might have felt in taking their daughter 
from the group known as Great Among the Nations for her own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr. had prohibited the defense from arguing 
that the Browns, another of their daughters, Holly, and two other co-defendants 
kidnaped Ginger Brown for her own sake. He ruled they had been unable to prove 
in pretrial hearings that their daughter was in any jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't talk that kind of defense, but maybe they're hearing it anyway," 
defense attorney Joe Judge said after hearing the jurors' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the testimony that was read back to the jury was by Daniel Weinstein, a 
former member of Great Among the Nations, who said he went to speak to Ginger 
Brown during a five-day deprogramming effort in May, 1988, "to warn her about 
the apparent and imminent danger she was in." 
</P>
<P>
Another area of testimony read to the jury was that of Earle Brown, who said he 
made his decision to "rescue" his daughter after receiving a transcript of a 
telephone conversation by Benjamin Altschul, the leader of Great Among the 
Nations, when he called members while in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Although the actual telephone transcripts were not admitted into evidence, the 
conversation had to do with alleged plans by Altschul to relocate the 17-member 
organization from San Diego to Israel. The transcript of the telephone 
conversation was made by a former member of Great Among the Nations who later 
left the group and turned his information over to David Elichaa, a father of 
another former group member who has helped lead opposition to Altschul's 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Altschul and Ginger Brown say Great Among the Nations is a fundamental 
Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, but critics say it is a cult 
whose members have been influenced by Altschul to finance his comfortable life 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The three Browns, deprogrammer Cliff Daniels, 34, of Los Angeles and Hank 
Erler, 23, of Escondido, are charged with kidnaping, false imprisonment and 
battery for the five-day deprogramming effort. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said he was frustrated by the jurors' questions 
Monday. "Those areas are totally inappropriate and getting away from the issues 
of the case and getting into areas of sympathy," he said. "There was no danger 
to Ginger Brown at any time, except when she was nabbed in daylight by the 
defendants themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The jury gave no indication Monday as to the progress in its deliberations, 
even when subtly baited by Moon. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent in some brownies earlier," the judge said, smiling to the jury. "Did 
they have any decision-making ingredients?" After a pause, he added quickly, 
"You don't have to answer that." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some more brownies," said Paula Demong, the presiding juror. 
</P>
<P>
Blurted out another: "Or some rum cake."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH PLEADS NO CONTEST IN HOSTAGE INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former San Gabriel High School student accused of holding his classmates 
hostage with a semiautomatic rifle pleaded no contest in Pasadena Superior 
Court on Monday to charges of kidnaping and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Lyne Cox, 19, who could have faced life sentences for those felonies, 
entered the plea after Judge Terry Smerling told Lyne that he would not be 
sentenced to more than 10 years and 8 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A sentencing hearing was set for April 6 pending a psychiatric review of Cox by 
the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Cox already has been found guilty of false imprisonment and burglary for 
storming his humanities class and holding about 60 students captive on April 
26, 1988. No one was injured in the 40-minute siege. But jurors were unable to 
reach agreement on the kidnaping and assault charges, forcing a mistrial Dec. 
19 on those counts.

WHERE'S ELVIS?;

<P>
FANS -- BUT NOT 'THE KING' -- CELEBRATE HIS 55TH BIRTHDAY

<P>
As Elvis Presley might have put it, Alviss Preston was "All Shook Up." 
</P>
<P>
Preston is a 41-year-old Elvis impersonator from Long Beach. And he didn't care 
for what he was seeing and hearing Monday at a Beverly Hills party -- one of 
several gatherings held Monday to mark the 55th anniversary of the birth of the 
rock 'n' roll legend. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Lee, known as the Chinese Elvis, was wrapping up a medley of the Memphis 
Elvis' greatest hits for the party crowd. The Long Beach Alviss wasn't 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little off-key," said Preston. "He doesn't have much power behind his 
voice. And he doesn't look like Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the others in the lunchtime crowd at Ed Debevic's restaurant in Beverly 
Hills didn't mind, however. They were pleased just to see a living reminder of 
the star who died Aug. 16, 1977, at Graceland, his mansion in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite well-publicized "sightings" of Elvis in recent years, his fans Monday 
were convinced that "The King" is really dead. 
</P>

"It's a shame he died so young, a tragedy," said Joan Gansky, 46, of Culver 
City. "But he's dead. I get very upset when someone says they saw him at K 
mart." 
</P>
<P>
Fan Cheri Hadley, 41, also of Culver City, agreed: "I don't like people 
capitalizing on whether he's alive." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Wiegert, 44, president of the 400-member Los Angeles-based Blue Hawaiians 
for Elvis Fan Club, said she was angered when she heard the first claims that 
Elvis was alive and in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are doing it to make money," said Wiegert, who has heard 
"spliced-together" phony tapes that purport to prove that Elvis lives. "But 
some people just miss him so much they keep the rumors alive." 
</P>
<P>
Elvis impersonator Lee, who showed up unannounced at the party staged by oldies 
music radio station KRLA-AM and performed in a studded black jumpsuit, seemed 
to be hedging his bets. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week he's in the media," Lee said. "But apparently he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 35, of Sherman Oaks, said he sometimes jokes about Elvis sightings during 
his performances. "I play along with the thought that he's alive. I say I've 
been living in Hong Kong and just released my newest single, 'Blue Suede 
Thongs.' People love it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the best efforts by impressionists, Elvis didn't make any Los Angeles 
appearances on his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
At the Elvis Market in South-Central Los Angeles, Elvis wasn't spotted all day. 
In fact, there wasn't an Elvis photograph or record anywhere to be found in the 
Avalon Boulevard grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"The store was named after the son of a former owner," said the store manager, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, restaurant operator Chris Bullock plastered Elvis photos around 
his Acapulco Mexican restaurant in preparation for an Elvis party Monday night. 
He said 150 Elvis fans had called in reservations to watch the "best Elvis 
look-alike" and "best moves and gyrations" contests. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock, an Elvis fan, replaced the restaurant's regular Mexican background 
music with Elvis tunes. "I'd rather listen to Englebert Humperdinck myself," 
admitted weary restaurant manager Cesar Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Beverly Hills, Alviss Preston -- who produced a driver's license to 
prove that is his real name -- had his own theory about Elvis' end. 
</P>
<P>
"You know he was killed -- murdered," Preston asserted. "If you read between 
the lines, you can see how they did it." 
</P>
<P>
As Elvis Presley might have put it, there are "Suspicious Minds."

EDISON POWERS UP NEW FACILITY DEMONSTRATING ENERGY-SAVING DEVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state-of-the-art energy conservation facility that includes a "house of the 
future" opened in Irwindale to favorable reviews Monday from public officials, 
environmentalists and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
But while the gadgets and gizmos meant to demonstrate energy-saving techniques 
might once have seemed futuristic or startlingly Space Age, today they are 
familiar: 
</P>
<P>
In a room oriented toward conservation applications for businesses, there was 
an industrial-size microwave oven for short-order processing of products from 
pickles to dog food. Parked in a driveway was a white electric-powered van with 
its batteries on display. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, an electric commercial kitchen oven turned out pizzas in five minutes 
-- two-thirds the usual cooking time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It cooks real fast, and the food tastes no different," said 
Alfonso Martinez, a chef on loan from a nearby pizza restaurant, as the smell 
of baking dough filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
On display in yet another room were light bulbs that last 10 times longer than 
conventional ones -- and cost from $12 to $16 each. However, officials said the 
bulbs more than pay for themselves in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The $4-million facility's purpose was summed up by Southern California Edison 
Co. Chairman Howard P. Allen, who said, "Here customers can learn firsthand how 
to conserve energy and reduce energy costs without sacrificing comfort or 
convenience or healthful air quality." 
</P>
<P>
Another official described the 23,000-square-foot building as "the largest and 
best equipped facility of its kind in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
He received no argument from a host of public officials, scientists and 
environmental experts, such as Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense 
Council and Art Rosenfeld, a UC Berkeley physicist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet internationally known environmental futurist Armory Lovins, who attended 
the unveiling of the facility, pointed out that the United States lags behind 
such nations as Japan in conservation measures. Japan, he said, "uses 50% less 
energy than America to produce $1 worth of product, and that gap is widening." 
</P>
<P>
"This facility helps do something about that. It's full of reasons for optimism 
that we can do much better," Lovins said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison created the facility after prodding by environmentalists and state 
Public Utilities Commission members who are concerned that California is 
back-sliding in the area of energy conservation. Allen acknowledged that the 
pressure was part of the reason Edison built it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have all the answers," Allen said. "This is an everybody-wins 
facility. We're committed to helping the officials in this area improve the air 
quality which is a major problem for the people of this basin." 
</P>
<P>
Edison invited a host of business, environmental, press and governmental guests 
to the facility's unveiling. Members of the general public may sign up for 
group tours, but the facility is geared primarily to Edison's commercial 
customers, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen noted that the facility has an industrial room where special furniture 
manufacturing ovens are on display. Because the energy-saving ovens use 
ultraviolet light, they can dry high-tech wood finishes without giving off the 
pollutants engendered by the usual varnishing process. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's furniture industry, cited as a culprit in air pollution, 
is struggling to meet strict air quality rules. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said many of the new appliances on display are expensive -- but worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're saying is there is a different and better way," said Edison 
research manager Geoff R. Bales as he stood before a bank of energy-efficient 
light bulbs. "These are state of the art, and we believe they are being 
underutilized. It will cost a little more, but it will pay for itself."

'FOLLOW-HOME' JEWEL THIEF IS CONVICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man was found guilty Monday of robbing nine middle-aged and elderly 
women of expensive jewelry after following them home from supermarkets in their 
Studio City neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberating for two days, a San Fernando Superior Court jury also found 
Claude Davis Jr., 38, guilty of attempting to rob a 10th woman and of 
inflicting great bodily injury on several of the victims, who ranged in age 
from 55 to 81. 
</P>
<P>
Davis showed little emotion as the verdicts were read. None of the women were 
in the courtroom. Davis could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Ramseyer said Davis, wearing a suit and tie and 
carrying a briefcase, approached the women in the driveways or garages of their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseyer said Davis would ask the women for directions and attack them as they 
tried to help, usually punching them and knocking them to the ground. The 
crimes were committed between May and December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, one 62-year-old victim testified that Davis suddenly lunged 
and punched her in the face with a clenched fist, knocking her down. She 
testified that he then sat on her and grabbed her by the throat before pulling 
three diamond rings off her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseyer said that in some cases, Davis continued to beat the victim after he 
had gotten her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
One victim, a violinist, lost the use of one of her fingers, he said. Other 
victims suffered broken bones, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry pieces taken from the women, mostly diamond rings, were estimated 
to be worth between $10,000 and $30,000 each, Ramseyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was arrested with his sister-in-law, Karen Davis of Van Nuys, Jan. 11 of 
last year after a special police team spotted him loitering in front of a 
supermarket at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
When police searched his car, they found black gloves and a briefcase matching 
the description of those used by the robber. Victims later identified Davis 
from photos and picked him out of a police lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Although some victims said a woman drove the getaway car, no charges were filed 
against Karen Davis because none of the victims could identify her. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Martin Gladstein did not comment on the verdict. A date for 
sentencing will be set today.

TWO MORE PEOPLE SHOT AT HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were shot and critically wounded Sunday night at the Carmelitos 
Housing Project in Long Beach, just 16 hours after a resident was killed and 
two others were injured in another attack there, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings appear to have been drug-related, though not connected, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest shooting, the two victims, Robert Savage, 38, of Wilmington and 
Howard Demery, 28, of Long Beach, were critically wounded during a robbery 
attempt "that occurred during the selling of drugs," Long Beach Police 
Detective George Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
"A victim, who was apparently selling drugs, was robbed and shot," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear which man was allegedly selling drugs or if any 
money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were taken to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where they were 
being treated for multiple gunshot wounds. No arrests were made, the detective 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier shooting, Ana Lechuga, 20, and her boyfriend, Mario Garcia, 20, 
were shot at their Carmelitos apartment at 4:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the couple argued about "money owed for drugs" with a visitor, who 
then shot them both in the head, Fox said. Garcia died shortly after being 
taken to the hospital. Lechuga was in critical condition Monday with three 
gunshot wounds in the head and neck. A third victim, Deborah Thomas, 27, was in 
stable condition with arm and leg wounds. Montie Harvey, 29, who lives in the 
housing complex, was arrested custody and booked on charges of murder and 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, which 
oversees the Carmelitos complex, said they have known for months about drug 
activity at Carmelitos, which until a few years ago was considered a model 
public housing project. Officials said security measures have been put in place 
to try to stem the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission said that drug activity has abated somewhat, residents 
say that five shooting victims in 16 hours does not bode well for the crime 
prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here for 25 years and I'm at the point where I'm scared to walk 
around outside, anywhere, even the parking lot," said a 27-year-old mother of 
one, who lives close to the apartment where Sunday's first shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up here, I felt safe. People used to say bad things about us 
because we lived in the project. But Carmelitos wasn't half as bad as it was 
talked about. Now, it's much worse than they talk about. People on the outside 
don't know what to make of it. They are getting scared, too, so they just keep 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Jackson, assistant executive director of the commission, said, "I admit 
that at Carmelitos, like other major (public housing) sites, we are having a 
problem with drugs. But we have identified the main players and we are in the 
process of arresting or serving eviction notices to the residents who are 
creating the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson added that criminal activity at the project has decreased since October 
when the commission contracted with the Long Beach Police Department to send in 
a nightly two-car, four-officer patrol. 
</P>
<P>
However, the police patrols at Carmelitos had to be dropped recently because of 
the costs, said Milton Patterson, manager of several county housing projects 
including Carmelitos. Because of the recent violence, the commission plans to 
renew the contract, Patterson said.

FIRST WOMAN WILL HEAD SCRIPPS COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney and high-ranking official at Dartmouth College has been appointed 
the first woman president in the 63-year history of Scripps College, a liberal 
arts school for women in Claremont, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With the appointment of Nancy Y. Bekavac, 42, Scripps alumni won their campaign 
for a woman to succeed John H. Chandler, who resigned last year after heading 
the campus for 13 years. Bekavac also will be the first woman president at any 
of the six schools in the Claremont Colleges consortium, of which Scripps is a 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Nancy Bekavac will make an exceptionally strong president and a 
remarkable role model for young women," said Martha Hammer, a Los Angeles 
attorney and Scripps alumna who was head of the presidential search committee. 
"She is someone who is going to make young women be better than they are, which 
to me is what education should be." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer stressed that her panel did not set out to find only female candidates, 
although all six finalists were women. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, 1988, Bekavac has been counselor to the president of Dartmouth 
College in New Hampshire, with responsibilities in planning, budgeting, public 
affairs and academics. Before that, she was executive director of the Thomas J. 
Watson Foundation, a Rhode Island-based organization that funds coveted 
fellowships, one of which Bekavac received after being graduated from 
Swarthmore College. Bekavac has a law degree from Yale University, worked in a 
Los Angeles law firm for 11 years and was an adjunct professor at UCLA Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Monday, Bekavac said she hopes to help Scripps "find 
what the best education for women will be in the 21st Century." She stressed 
that she believes the best undergraduate education can be obtained at small, 
private schools and that women's colleges produce a disproportionately high 
number of graduates who go on to earn more advanced degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps, which has about 600 students, is one of only three women's colleges 
left in California. Mills College in Oakland and Mt. St. Mary's College in Los 
Angeles are the other two. Twenty years ago, there were about a dozen women's 
schools in the state, but most either turned coeducational, merged with men's 
schools or closed, according to education experts. Mills is studying the 
possibility of going co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Scripps is committed to remaining a women's school, officials, 
including Bekavac, said. Its setting within the Claremont Colleges -- which 
include Pomona, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer and Claremont Graduate 
School -- allows Scripps students to take classes with and socialize with men. 
And the recent completion of a $41-million fund-raising drive gave Scripps more 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler left the campus in June to work on a book in Britain. Since then, 
former Provost Howard Brooks has temporarily served as president. He is 
expected to carry on in that role until Bekavac takes office July 1.

PARK PROGRAM ALLOWING DOGS TO RUN UNLEASHED EXTENDED 6 MONTHS BY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES and CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission on Monday extended for six 
months a pilot program allowing dogs to run off-leash in Laurel Canyon Park, 
and recommended that the City Council set up new dog parks in Griffith Park and 
the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The commission extended the program, scheduled to expire in March, after dog 
owners and city staff members gave enthusiastic reports on the success of the 
controversial pilot project that began in the spring of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be very proud of what you have done. I bring my dog there five 
times a week," said Howard Bragman, a member of Parkwatch, a group that has 
lobbied heavily for the off-leash park. 
</P>
<P>
"If you measure the program by volume, it has been an extraordinary success," 
Bragman said, saying that there are not enough parking spaces to accommodate 
the waves of dog owners wanting to use the park. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters called for the establishment of more such parks, and one elected 
official, Councilman Joel Wachs, predicted Monday that his colleagues will 
easily vote for new dog runs at Griffith Park and the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, chairman of the council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee, made 
his observation as the committee directed city parks officials to prepare a 
detailed proposal for two new dog runs 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that it's going to be approved," said Wachs, noting new dog parks are 
needed to lessen canine crowding at Laurel Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, 1988, Laurel Canyon Park has been the only city park where dogs 
may run unleashed, although only during certain hours. The council approved it 
as an experiment after a three-year controversy that began in 1985 when Wachs, 
who represented the area at the time, cracked down on unleashed pets in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
But the four-acre park's growing popularity among dog owners from elsewhere in 
the city has prompted Councilman Michael Woo, who now represents the area, to 
seek the additional dog space in Griffith Park and the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The two extra dog runs, Woo said, "would significantly reduce the burden on 
Laurel Canyon Park." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has been pleased with what has happened at Laurel Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community would like our park back," Janja Vujovich, a vocal opponent, 
testified at the parks commission meeting. Vujovich told the commission that 
trash cans in which dog feces were disposed of were left uncovered by dog 
owners, and she questioned whether the commission could extend the program 
legally without a full review of its environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
The locations of the proposed new dog runs in the Griffith Park and Sepulveda 
Basin have yet to be determined, said Jim Hadaway, general manager of the 
Department of Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs told Hadaway to return to the council committee within the next month 
with a more precise proposal. Building fenced dog exercise areas at both parks 
is expected to cost about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs also suggested that Hadaway find locations elsewhere in the city for dog 
parks.

PACKAGE EXPLODES, INJURING MAN INVOLVED IN DISPUTE WITH NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
A dispute over the crash of a remote-control toy plane may have sparked a feud 
between two Diamond Bar neighbors in the Cimarron Oaks Town Houses that 
escalated Monday with the explosion of a package bomb that injured one of the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two guys -- neither one seems that bad -- they hate each other," said a 
neighbor of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Mang, 35, of Sylvan Glen Road received burns and cuts on his abdomen, 
hands and face when he opened a wooden box wrapped Christmas-style that was 
addressed to him. He was treated by paramedics at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Mang had found the box on his front porch shortly after 8:30 a.m. while he was 
sweeping leaves in front of his condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion rocked the quiet neighborhood. Construction worker Moni Atie, who 
was laboring on a new park downhill from the ridge where Mang's condominium 
sits, said he thought at first that Mang had accidentally shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Mang walked distractedly back and forth in front of his condominium after the 
blast. Another neighbor heard him say, "It was in my hands. It was in my 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the explosion, Mang told sheriff's detectives summoned to his home that 
he had been involved for some months in a dispute with a neighbor, said 
Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Moya of the department's arson and explosives team. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies are also investigating the possible link of Monday's explosion to an 
incident that occurred in September when a large firecracker called a "Mexican 
half-stick or half-stick of dynamite," was thrown into Mang's side yard, said 
Moya. Mang was not injured in the earlier incident. 
</P>
<P>
Mang, who heads the condominium project's architectural and landscape 
committee, has lived there for about 2 1/2 years with his wife and two 
children, an infant and a 3-year-old, said a neighbor who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor said Mang spoke of an incident five months ago when another 
condominium resident accidentally crashed a remote-control toy plane into 
Mang's small side yard. Angered that the plane could have injured his children, 
Mang got into an argument with the man, the neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the firecracker was tossed into Mang's yard. Mang and 
another condominium resident, believing the toy plane pilot was the culprit, 
looked for the man but were unable to find him at home, the neighbor said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man remained in County Jail Monday after being arrested on 
suspicion of embezzling $50,000 from clients while impersonating a Phoenix 
attorney, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested Steven Kurt Dony, 35, as he drove away from his law office 
in the 500 block of West Beech Street at 5:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dony is being held on parole violation, and faces additional charges of grand 
theft, auto theft, and filing a fraudulent credit application, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Dony established the San Diego law office under the name of Curtis 
Ullmann Associates, Attorneys at Law. Over a period of time, Dony represented 
numerous local clients, some in court. The real Curtis Ullmann is a lawyer in 
Phoenix with no connections to Dony, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Dony tried to lease $20,000 worth of office furniture from P.S. 
Leasing in Oakhurst, Calif. Officials of the company became suspicious when 
they discovered that a company Dony claimed to represent, Mellon Financial of 
Philadelphia, does not have an office in San Diego. The branch number he used 
for Mellon Financial was connected to his home in the 1000 block of Scott 
Street, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Dony ran a similar operation in Riverside and was convicted in 
September, 1987. He was released on parole in August, 1988. Police said they 
suspect that Dony has run similar schemes in Sacramento, Orange County and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that, when they arrested Dony, he was driving a car that had been 
reported stolen in Los Angeles.

REPORTER'S KILLER IS SENTENCED TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The convicted killer of Daily Californian reporter Steve Petix was sentenced 
Monday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years was added to the sentence of David Weeding, 40, of Santee, for 
four prior rape convictions in Texas in 1975 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Petix, 31, was stabbed five times as he came to the aid of his wife, Vickie 
Petix, 24, while Weeding tried to rape her in the couple's El Cajon apartment 
on May 20, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought the death penalty, but a San Diego Superior Court jury 
recommended Dec. 11 that Weeding be given a life sentence without parole. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that he will not be a free man again, and that's good 
enough for me," Vickie Petix said after the sentencing by Superior Court Judge 
Wayne Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will bring Steve back." 
</P>
<P>
Weeding turned in a handwritten appeal of his first-degree murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Petix's brother, Mark Petix, a newspaper reporter in Riverside, said the 
sentencing marks "hopefully the final chapter." 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Petix testified that Weeding appeared at her door posing as a repairman 
and asked to check for plumbing leaks. She said she let him in because she had 
a leaking pipe in her bedroom. Once inside, Weeding attacked her at knifepoint. 
During the attack, Steve Petix came home for lunch from his job at the El Cajon 
newspaper. Vickie Petix said she saw Weeding lunge toward her husband as she 
fled the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Weeding did not testify at his trial or at his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, Weeding's attorney, Robert Bourne, said, "Life without 
parole means life without parole."

I feel President Bush should be commended for using the military as a police 
force in Panama to make the streets safe for people to come out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
If we (in the U.S.) are going to use the military as a police force (spend 
taxpayers dollars) to make streets safe in a foreign country, what about the 
streets in America such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Detroit, etc? We have 
more crime and killings in American cities on a weekend than Panama has in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It is time we take back the streets and parks of America. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, we have Noriegas in most cities of America who are also common 
criminals and need to be brought to justice.

SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As expected, The Times still exhibits the Rostenkowski/Bentsen syndrome with 
its sour grapes editorial "On Surviving the Medicare Crunch" (Dec. 26). 
</P>
<P>
The catastrophic Medicare surtax law was the first time in history that a 
single segment of the population was to be required to pay a surtax for a much 
larger segment who paid nothing, including 2.8 million disabled, 1.2 million 
spouses of disabled and unknown quantities of AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
And it was a 15% surtax! If the average taxpayer were asked to pay even a 1% 
surtax for something, he would balk. It was no surprise that the grass-roots 
middle-income elderly taxpayers caused a veritable firestorm of revolt, 
culminating in repeal of the infamous P.L. 100-360. 
</P>
<P>
National health care, including long-term care, is badly needed but the 
financial burden must be distributed across the taxpaying public -- the same as 
any tax. It should not wholly burden a small minority. 
</P>
<P>
My only regret is that when President Bush signed the repeal law that there 
were not fountain pens given to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen D-Texas), the American Assn. of Retired People and The Times!

THE CATCH WILL BE THE MEATBALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since time immemorial, or at least since the noodle was invented, there have 
been only two socially acceptable ways for adults to eat spaghetti. There is 
the genteel method of holding a fork in one hand, a spoon in the other, and 
twirling the pasta into a little ball that can be slid into the mouth with only 
slight risk of embarrassing mishap. 
</P>
<P>
Or a fork is used to chop the spaghetti into little pieces for easier pickup 
and delivery, similarly a method likely to leave no unsightly remnants behind. 
</P>
<P>
But now, in mankind's ever-upward march toward progress, comes news of a third, 
non-messy method for consuming noodles. Nicholas A. Ruggieri of Rochester, N.Y. 
has even been granted a patent for his spaghetti sipper, which, it must be said 
at the onset, isn't for any old kind of spaghetti. It requires a single 
continuous strand, yards and yards of it, like dental floss. Once that's 
obtained, the cooked pasta and its sauce are put inside a deep cup-like 
container with one end of the spaghetti strand fed up through a straw to the 
lid. The spaghetti is then sipped, like a milkshake. 
</P>
<P>
A classic example of building a better mousetrap? Perhaps, but the sipper does 
strike us something that might find favor with drivers who like to consume a 
meal as they ply the freeway. Drivers who feed as they speed have always seemed 
to us to be a particular hazard. But if dining on the freeways is going to 
happen, we suppose it's preferable that it be done with meals that can be held 
in one hand. Safe noodling, as it were.

DEMONSTRATIONS BY AIDS ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a quiet demonstration staged by 10 AIDS activists during mass at 
a Catholic Church, Mahony is quoted as saying, "This isn't the first time . . . 
we have been thrown to the lions." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony has the analogy correct, but not its object. 
</P>
<P>
It is gay people who are being thrown daily to the "lions" by prejudice and 
ignorance concerning AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue of The Times another article ("AIDS and the Arts," Calendar) 
underscores that tragic fact by itemizing the toll AIDS has taken on the arts. 
Had the information the archbishop denounces regarding condoms been available, 
these artists might still be among us and creating fine art. 
</P>
<P>
A recent photograph in The Times of an anonymous priest lifting his skirts to 
step over an AIDS activist is denunciation enough of the church's position. Yet 
with shocking arrogance, Mahony can assert that he and priests who agree with 
him -- and who for their own reasons have chosen lifelong chastity -- are 
"proclaiming the truth as God has taught."

The AIDS activists who tried to disrupt the parade were almost right in the 
wording of their sign. 
</P>
<P>
They missed it by only one word. Instead of reading "Emergency. Stop the 
parade. 70,000 dead of AIDS," it should have read "Emergency. Stop the 
promiscuity. 70,000 dead of AIDS."

MORPHINE CAN KILL ONLY PART OF THE PAIN; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH: WE FOCUS ON PHYSICAL PAIN, BUT EMOTIONAL PAIN USUALLY IS MORE DIFFICULT 
TO TREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. BAKER, Dr. David W. Baker is a Robert Wood Johnson clinical scholar 
at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fatal shooting of Steven Charles Jenkins, a terminally ill AIDS patient, by 
his friend Philip Lee Saylor on Jan. 2 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has again 
focused attention on the problems of death and dying in our society. 
</P>
<P>
The attending physician in the case, Dr. Phillip C. Zakowski, expressed his 
regrets about the apparent mercy killing, saying that although he understood 
the emotional difficulties of the situation, "allowing us to use morphine 
(anesthesia) would have been a much more humane way . . . . That is a very 
comfortable, painless way to let nature take its course." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no painless way to die. By focusing on the physical 
pain, we lose sight of the emotional pain facing patients and their families. 
The latter is usually more difficult to "treat." The dying patient must 
struggle with loss of physical function, increasing dependence on others, 
constant threats to dignity brought about by the illness and the growing 
awareness that he or she will be separated from loved ones. Loved ones suffer 
as they watch the patient endure this. 
</P>
<P>
They grieve for his or her losses as well as their own. In addition, they must 
deal with their guilt over past conflicts with the patient, feelings of 
inadequacy from their inability to help and questions of their own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, intravenous morphine will provide little relief for these things. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is much that can be done, starting with communication. Patients must 
try to express their wants, needs and fears. Physicians must facilitate this by 
being willing to listen to patients. They also must explore these issues 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
Family members must be involved from the start to help provide support for the 
patient and to deal with their own emotional needs. Through this, realistic 
goals can be established and a treatment plan formulated according to the 
patient's wishes. Through communication, understanding and support, desperate 
acts by patients and family members can be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we must all acknowledge that in many situations, a "painless" death is 
a myth. There are times when physical and emotional pain persist, despite all 
efforts. Some patients say that the only time they are without pain is when 
they are receiving so much medication that they are unconscious. Others, 
although not in pain, are so debilitated by their condition that they find that 
the burdens of life surpass any joy that they might feel. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this constitutes an acceptable existence is something that only the 
patient can decide. We must not delude ourselves into believing that we can 
eliminate this type of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
We must acknowledge our limitations so that our society can move forward and 
explore more humane options for dealing with the terminally ill, such as 
euthanasia. Unless we provide patients and their families with some way of 
relieving their anguish, they will continue to use whatever means they feel are 
available to them.

THE WAR OF NERVES MOVES ON; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: FOR ALL THE PEAKS OF PUBLIC ANXIETY, ON BALANCE WE'VE MADE PROGRESS 
AGAINST INDISCRIMINATE MAYHEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN M. JENKINS, Brian M. Jenkins is a managing director of Kroll 
Associates, Los Angeles, an international investigative and consulting firm. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Did we win the war against terrorism? 
</P>
<P>
Our virtual obsession for so much of the '80s, terrorism aroused national alarm 
-- Americans avoided Europe in the summer of 1986. It stirred deep anger -- 
public opinion demanded retaliation and supported summary justice. It elicited 
bellicose warnings -- "You can run but you can't hide." It provoked the use of 
American military power on several occasions -- and defined the limits of that 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back through a landscape ringed with concrete anti-truck-bomb barriers 
and explosives-detection machines, how did we come out? 
</P>
<P>
The '80s saw undeniable progress in combatting terrorism: Intelligence 
improved; many terrorist attacks were thwarted. We invested heavily in the 
security of our diplomatic posts abroad. We increased security measures for our 
airlines, with discernible results: Terrorist hijackings declined. We extended 
our legal jurisdiction to cover terrorist crimes abroad and demonstrated our 
willingness and ability to apprehend terrorists overseas and bring them to 
trial in the United States. The use of military force in response to 
state-sponsored terrorism is now an established precedent. 
</P>
<P>
We also made progress on the diplomatic front. The United States and its 
European allies cooperated more closely, although our constant moral hectoring 
caused some resentment in Europe; we had scant European support for our use of 
military force against Libya. Cooperation with the Israelis remained strong, 
although they bitterly opposed our new relationship with Yasser Arafat, whom we 
persuaded to publicly renounce terrorism. For our part, Americans did not see 
all violence in Israel's occupied territories as Palestinian terrorism. 
Perceptions change. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this progress, the '80s saw terrorism increase to its highest level. 
And it was bloodier. The most alarming trend was the increased incidence of 
large-scale indiscriminate violence. Bombs were set off on city streets, aboard 
airliners, at airports and in department stores and discotheques -- all actions 
calculated to kill in quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Bombs aboard airliners are the major security challenge we face today. In the 
past two decades, terrorists have brought down 14 airliners, taking 1,494 lives 
-- about 10% of all airline fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
While bombings caused spells of mass public anxiety, the taking of hostages 
caused political crises that raised moral dilemmas. As the '80s began, 
Americans were being held hostage in Tehran; as the decade ended, Americans 
were being held hostage in Lebanon. In the last 10 years, there were only 258 
days in which American citizens were not being held by terrorists somewhere in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage-taking raised fundamental philosophical and moral questions: Does 
providing for the "common defense," as called for in the Constitution, extend 
to the threat of terrorism? Or can our government do no more than issue travel 
advisories? What commitment does our government have to its citizens when they 
are held hostage abroad? Should we ever bargain for hostages? Our policy says 
no. Some of the American hostages in Lebanon are approaching their sixth year 
in captivity and their freedom is not in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Ideologically motivated terrorists in Western Europe -- the Red Army Faction, 
the Red Brigades, Action Directe -- declined in the '80s, but they did not 
disappear. For the West, Palestinian and Iranian-inspired extremists posed the 
greatest danger. Despite Arafat's new line, this is likely to remain the case. 
</P>
<P>
Fears fed prejudice. The Khomeinis, the Kadafis, the Abu Nidals became models 
for a hundred Hollywood villains. Arab-Americans complained of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The decade began with the United States accusing the Soviet Union of being the 
instigator and coordinator of international terrorism, and it ended with the 
two countries consulting on how they might cooperate in combatting terrorism. 
Fears in Moscow that violent strains of Islamic fundamentalism might spread to 
the nation's 50 million Muslims, or that ethnic antagonisms might provoke 
domestic terrorist campaigns caused Soviet leaders to reevaluate their policy. 
The new Soviet posture met skepticism and suspicion on this side. A tentative 
dialogue continues. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s also began with the promise of swift retribution but ended with our 
frustrating inability to identify and apprehend those responsible for bringing 
down Pan Am 103. Terrorists, we learned, can hide. 
</P>
<P>
If terrorists provided no targets to attack with conventional military power, 
thoughts turned to other measures that are officially prohibited. Some members 
of the Senate even wondered aloud whether assassination might not be an 
appropriate way to combat terrorists. That, in turn, raised a broader question: 
To what extent should those things we call American values constrain operations 
even against those we call terrorists? 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the decade, we can say only that we made it more difficult for 
terrorists to do dreadful things. Beyond that, the war against terrorism defies 
tidy reckoning. There is no bottom line. No unconditional surrender. No final 
victory. Terrorism will persist in the 1990s. The war continues.

<P>
The average price of an existing house sold in metropolitan San Diego area was 
a record $220,751 in December, a 21% increase over the average cost in 
December, 1988, according to a recent survey of transactions by members of the 
San Diego Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of resold homes was $174,000, or 11% higher than the median 
price a year previous. 
</P>
<P>
The median price is the level at which half of all houses were sold for more 
and the rest for less. 
</P>
<P>
Member realtors sold 1,292 houses in December, or 16% more than the 1,111 units 
sold in the comparable month a year ago. For the 12 months ended in December, 
total resales were 20,223, or 5% more than the 19,243 houses sold in all of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The record average price set for December ended an eight-month period during 
which the average prices remained flat, staying within a range of between 
$217,000 and $209,000. The median price, however, is still less than the 
$175,000 median price of April, 1989.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year was a good one for stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial and 
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 averages, both of which were up 27%. San Diego-based 
companies, most of them smaller and not held by institutional investors, did 
not fare as well, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San 
Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 60-odd publicly traded San Diego firms, the average gain was about 18%. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the local gainers was International Totalizator, which began to show 
excellent profits from its large backlog, gaining 271% for the year. Following 
were DH Technology, up 160% on increasing quarterly earnings, and Mycogen, a 
biopesticide company that was up 141%. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the best gains were made by the small banks, as takeover prospects 
made for sharp increases. BSD Bancorp was up 123%; La Jolla Bancorp, which will 
be merged into Security Pacific Bank this year, was up 98%; First National was 
up 72%, and San Diego National Bancorp was up 60%. Southwest Bank was up 50% 
before the stock was merged with Security Pacific in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Other good gains were made in special situations, including Xytronyx, up 139%; 
Medical Imaging Centers, up 114%; Mail Boxes Etc., up 100%; Infrasonics, up 
86%, and Magma Power, up 59%. Of the institutional favorites, Home Federal 
gained 58%, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 18%, and Price Club 23%. Rohr 
Industries was down 27%. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks that fell were led by Imperial Corp. of America, down 89% as 
its problem loans and junk bond portfolio continued to be a factor. Following 
were CCT Corp., down 73%; SSI, down 57%; Lancer Orthodontics, down 56%, and 
Amistar, down 55%. 
</P>
<P>
Investors became impatient waiting for biotechnology companies to show 
earnings. As a result, Agouron Pharmaceuticals was down 40% and Synbiotics was 
down 34% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
During the year, Western Health Plans' stock was delisted and became valueless. 
Fisher Scientific Group was merged into Henley Group at $22.25 a share. 
Gen-Probe was purchased by Chugai Pharmaceutical at $6.25 a share. Monitor 
Technology was purchased by Lear-Siegler at $8 a share. Pancretec was purchased 
by Abbott Laboratories at $15 a share, and Langley Corp. was merged into Fleet 
Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Henley Group and Syntro both moved and consequently were dropped from San Diego 
County stock listings. Furnishings 2000, Telequest, Weaver Arms and Yuba 
Natural Resources were dropped by NASDAQ and from the listings as well. 
</P>
<P>
Three companies have been added to the list to begin the year. Alliance 
Pharmaceutical and MarrowTech, which recently moved to San Diego, and the 
locally based vitamin and mineral manufacturer Natural Alternatives are being 
added to the list. Natural Alternatives last week had a 1-for-50 reverse stock 
split.

VALLEY EARNINGS: BISHOP INC.'S EARNINGS DOWN 78% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Inc., an Agoura Hills company that markets and distributes engineering, 
architectural and design products, said it earned $38,000 in the fiscal fourth 
quarter that ended Sept. 30, down 78% from $176,000 in net earnings a year 
earlier. Revenue rose 16% to $2.7 million from $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended Sept. 30, Bishop reported a loss of $355,000, compared 
with a year-earlier loss of $2.5 million. Revenue totaled $10.2 million, up 1% 
from $10.1 million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, which has struggled in recent years, got into trouble when it reacted 
slowly to the computerization of its industry. But Kenneth Kay, Bishop's 
president, said the company's restructuring is starting to pay off, and 
fourth-quarter operating results improved because of cost cutting and increased 
sales of turn-key engineering workstation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said it was recently dropped from the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers' National Market System, which, according to new rules, requires that a 
company have a net worth of at least $4 million. Net worth is usually defined 
as a company's total assets minus total liabilities. Bishop, which has a net 
worth of $2.5 million, now trades on the NASD's over-the-counter list.

VALLEY EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM REVISES EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortune Petroleum, an Agoura Hills oil and gas concern, revised its earnings 
sharply lower for the third quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a recalculation of its depletion, depreciation and amortization figures, 
Fortune said it earned $4,000 in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, instead of 
the $34,000 profit it originally reported. The company's year-earlier loss of 
$26,000 was unchanged, as was its revenue, which climbed to $230,000 from 
$194,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1989, Fortune posted a revised loss of $36,000, 
instead of the $6,000 loss it initially reported. The company did not revise 
its year-earlier loss of $34,000, nor did it alter its nine-month revenue, 
which rose to $734,000 from $651,000.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: ALPHAREL LAYS OFF 19, CUTS ASSETS' VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alpharel Inc., an ailing producer of computer equipment, cut its work force by 
32% and wrote down the value of certain inventory and other assets as part of a 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo-based company, which laid off 19 of its 59 workers, said it would 
take a $3.6-million charge against its fourth-quarter 1989 earnings to cover 
restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
Alpharel also said it hired the investment banking firm Houlihan, Lokey, Howard 
&amp; Zukin Capital in Los Angeles to find a possible buyer or partner for the 
company as a way of boosting Alpharel's financial health. Alpharel's financial 
troubles have eaten away most of the company's cash. As of Sept. 30, the 
company had cash and equivalents of $1.8 million, down from $9.4 million in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alpharel, which lost $7.07 million on revenue of $3.37 million in the nine 
months that ended Sept. 30, said last month that it had contacted other parties 
about a possible merger but had not received any serious indications of 
interest.

Braves and Beef: Hank Aaron thinks about roast beef as well as baseball. The 
home run king, who is now an executive with the Atlanta Braves, is buying 
Arby's franchises and plans to have nine of the fast-food restaurants by the 
end of the year, according to Success magazine. Aaron gets former teammates to 
come out to the openings of the restaurants and each one features Aaron 
memorabilia. "Being my own boss has been a wonderful experience for me," Aaron

Revealing Work: In a capital city full of advocates, the new year has unveiled 
a new lobbyist who promotes only the bare facts. Kevin Kearney is the first 
paid and registered lobbyist in Washington representing nudists. Kearney, 38, 
is the spokesman for the 35,000-member American Sunbathing Assn. "No, I'm not a 
nudist," he says, "but I guess I'm becoming one. I got nude at their convention 
last year -- for business purposes." Kearney says his group lobbies only for 
"non-sexual" fun such as "hot tubbing and skinny-dipping." A major part of his 
lobbying job is to persuade officials in charge of public parks and forests 
officials to permit "clothing-optional" areas. "Finding a champion in Congress 
is a problem," Kearney said. "But we'll find one."

There Goes the Neighborhood: Putting together a defense for Manuel Noriega 
hasn't been the only problem facing Miami lawyer Frank Rubino lately. The city 
has been trying to boot Rubino out of his Coconut Grove law office because it's 
in a residential area. Rubino's request for a change in the zoning laws was 
scheduled to go before city officials Monday night. Long before Noriega was 
sent to Miami to stand trial on cocaine trafficking charges, Coconut Grove 
residents complained that they didn't want Rubino's criminal clientele coming 
to their neighborhood. Rubino told board members that if his rezoning request 
is defeated, he might have to convert the office into a home. "Their worst 
fears could come true," Rubino said. "I could move in." YEMI TOURE

DRUG ADVANCES LEAVE CHILDREN OUT IN THE COLD; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: FEW NEW MEDICINES ARE BEING TESTED ON YOUNGSTERS. PEDIATRICIANS WANT 
DRUG MAKERS TO PROVIDE BETTER GUIDELINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, Irene Wielawski is a free-lance writer based in Los 
Angeles.

<P>
Nancy Sander was elated when she read of a new allergy medicine that did not 
cause drowsiness. Her 15-year-old son, Michael Gregory, suffered terribly from 
hay fever-type symptoms in the spring and fall, but all of the antihistamines 
his doctor recommended made him too groggy to concentrate in school. 
</P>
<P>
Sander immediately called the pediatric group near her home in Fairfax, Va., to 
request a prescription for the drug, Seldane. But the doctor on duty refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Seldane was not approved by the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for 
children my son's age," Sander recalls. "I was really irritated." 
</P>
<P>
Sander's experience is typical. 
</P>
<P>
The last 50 years have seen a virtual explosion in new drugs to combat disease 
and alleviate suffering. But children have largely been excluded from these 
medical advances. 
</P>
<P>
Most new prescription drugs have never been tested on children, leaving 
pediatricians with a limited FDA-approved drug arsenal. Some pediatricians are 
also concerned about the possibility of civil lawsuits should they prescribe 
drugs lacking FDA approval, even though the agency does not prohibit the use of 
such drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Sander, however, is not one easily put off by such technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
She is the founder of Mothers of Asthmatics, a 5,000-member educational and 
advocacy organization born of experiences with her daughter, Brooke, a severe 
asthmatic since infancy. Brooke's life had been saved several times by drugs 
lacking FDA approval for use in children, so Sander was not about to let such a 
restriction on Seldane deny her son its potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
She waited until the family's regular pediatrician returned from a trip, and 
she made a convincing case for at least trying the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year since, Seldane has prevented his allergies and he's just fine," 
Sander says. 
</P>
<P>
Sander's experience ended happily, but such is not always the case. 
</P>
<P>
The history of drug development in the 20th Century is pocked with disasters 
resulting from inadequately tested drugs. Ironically, most victims of these 
mistakes were children, among them the thousands of babies in Western Europe 
maimed in utero when the drug Thalidomide was given to pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA, as we know it today -- a screening agency to which drug companies must 
prove their products are safe and effective -- was born out of a tragedy in 
1937 involving the early antibacterial drug sulfanilamide. Seeking to 
capitalize on its popularity, one company sought to market a more easily 
administered liquid form, unaware that the company chemist used as his solvent 
diethylene glycol, an ingredient of antifreeze and a deadly poison. 
</P>
<P>
The error was never picked up in the company's pre-marketing tests, which 
looked only at fragrance, texture and appearance, according to Wallace F. 
Janssen, the FDA's historian. One hundred and seven people died, most of them 
children whose parents had been advised to administer the syrup for sore 
throats. 
</P>
<P>
There were smaller-scale catastrophes in newborn nurseries when drugs used 
successfully in adults were discovered to be toxic to babies with immature 
kidneys and livers. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that children are not little adults, when it comes to 
calculating doses or anticipating side effects," says Dr. Edwin N. Forman, 
professor of pediatrics at Brown University and director of the children's 
cancer center at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
Most cancer drugs -- powerful agents with a host of potentially lethal side 
effects -- are marketed for adults before they are tested on children. Forman 
uses these adult drugs very cautiously, sharing observations and experiences 
with counterparts at about 50 other pediatric cancer centers. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Pediatric Oncology Group, his is one of several such cooperative 
organizations nationally that maintain a data bank that doctors can use to 
guide their use of cancer drugs on children. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this sort of monitoring system for the use of adult drugs in 
children is the exception rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Many drugs that clear the FDA without scientific studies in children will 
eventually be used on them in isolated, experimental situations when 
conventional treatment fails. 
</P>
<P>
The results eventually may be shared at professional meetings or through 
medical journals, but the delay in delineating a drug's therapeutic value -- or 
harmfulness -- in children is often counted in years, according to Dr. Ralph E. 
Kauffman, director of clinical pharmacology at Children's Hospital of Michigan 
in Detroit and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman is at the forefront of a growing movement to improve children's access 
to pharmacological advances, and he has a lot of support from pediatricians 
such as Forman, who has spent 30 years struggling with inadequate data from 
drug manufacturers to guide use of their products in his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"New drugs are constantly being developed because the standard therapy is 
inadequate," Forman says. "But children are left out of these advances. As 
pediatricians, we are always behind and always dependent on guesswork." 
</P>
<P>
Only about 20% of new drugs are evaluated in children before they get FDA 
approval. The rest usually end up described this way in the Physicians Desk 
Reference -- the standard text that provides doctors with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers' instructions -- "Safety and effectiveness in children have not 
been established." 
</P>
<P>
"It does not mean physicians can't use the drugs, but that they have no data to 
guide their use," says Dr. Wayne R. Snodgrass, chief of clinical pharmacology 
at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Like Kauffman, he is 
among about a dozen specialists nationally in pediatric pharmacology. 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, doctors will adjust for a child's size and factor in 
differences in infant metabolism and physiology to cut the recommended adult 
dosage. They may consult by telephone with doctors more experienced in using 
the drug. They may search the pediatric medical journals for an account of the 
drug's performance under similar circumstances in young patients. But it is a 
rough calculation at best. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the inhaled asthma drugs, for example, are not approved for use by 
young children, yet thousands of youngsters depend upon them for relief of 
wheezing and coughing -- and have for more than a decade, according to Dr. Gary 
Rachelefsky. The Los Angeles allergy specialist says he has been studying the 
use of inhaled steroids in asthmatic children since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
And virtually all of the drugs used to treat the life-threatening conditions of 
premature babies have not been approved for use in children, Snodgrass says. 
</P>
<P>
Why pharmaceutical companies market drugs without adequate testing in children 
is the subject of a long-running debate. Several medical conferences were held 
on the issue as far back as 1974, but the situation has changed little since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, though, the debate has taken on greater urgency as more children with 
serious, long-term illness such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, certain 
cancers and other immune-compromising conditions confront the dearth of drugs 
scientifically evaluated for pediatric use. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the relatively small numbers of children with chronic heart 
problems, high blood pressure or other diseases more commonly seen in adults 
have always had to depend on adjusted dosages of adult medications. 
</P>
<P>
But requiring pediatric testing as a condition of approval raises a different 
set of problems, FDA spokesman Mike Shaffer says. 
</P>
<P>
First, the FDA is not authorized to require such tests, Shaffer says. Congress 
would have to give the agency additional muscle, Shaffer says, to order 
pediatric drug tests as a condition for marketing approval. 
</P>
<P>
Second, long delays already characterize the progress of new drugs from test 
tube to market -- a journey averaging seven to 10 years, according to Jeffrey 
L. Trewhitt, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. The 
association represents about 100 drug companies that develop most of the new 
drugs in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Drug development does not come cheaply, either, averaging $125 million in 
up-front costs for each drug that clears the FDA, Trewhitt says. 
</P>
<P>
The agency worries that a pediatric testing requirement would further slow the 
process. And since new drug development depends greatly upon a drug company's 
willingness to absorb the costs, the FDA is reluctant to discourage the 
industry with additional regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"The population (of seriously ill children) is so small that it doesn't justify 
a drug company's trouble and expense to seek approval in this area," says the 
FDA's Shaffer. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the pharmaceutical industry plays down the profit factor, 
justifying decisions not to test certain drugs on children on ethical and legal 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"From the ethical standpoint, the concern is that children can be more 
vulnerable," Trewhitt says. "They raise more cancer concerns than adults 
because they are still growing. There is also a concern that testing 
experimental drugs in children could affect growth in a key body organ. And 
legally, product liability lawsuits abound in this country." 
</P>
<P>
But Kauffman decries such justifications as a disingenuous cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see that when there is an economic incentive, they have done the 
work," Kauffman says, pointing to drugs commonly used to treat conditions that 
affect large numbers of children. In order to get FDA approval for pediatric 
use, drug companies have voluntarily tested antibiotics for the ear and 
respiratory infections that occur frequently in childhood as well as 
over-the-counter preparations for fever and colds. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the drug companies don't voluntarily test more 
specialized drugs that might be used by a smaller group of children. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," Kauffman says, "the most unethical thing to do is to subject kids to 
drugs that have not been tested in children, so that each child becomes an 
individual experiment." 
</P>
<P>
His cause is gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA isn't ignoring the problem and neither are we," Kauffman says. "The 
committee on drugs (of the pediatrics academy) now has a contract with the FDA, 
and we are working with them to identify information from medical journals and 
other sources on drugs used in children and compile it to include in drug 
labeling." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Institute of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has been 
sufficiently aroused to convene a conference on the subject next April. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go," says Kauffman, "but there are some things happening 
that give us hope."

AFTER HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I had a bypass operation close to a year ago. Shortly after, my 
doctor recommended that I get involved in a cardiac rehabilitation program, but 
I guess I was too upset at the time to do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry now that I didn't, and I'd like to know if such a program would do me 
any good if I got into one now. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The results of one study suggest that patients can benefit from a 
cardiac rehabilitation program even if they enter one up to two years after 
having had a heart attack or bypass surgery. However, those who begin 
participating in such a program within six months of the event do appear to 
realize greater benefits from it.

GIVING VOICE TO SCIENCE'S MAVERICKS

Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific 
Knowledge by Robert Scott Root-Bernstein (Harvard; $35; 501 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Mann says people are divided between burghers and artists, cautious 
townsmen and creative spirits. One says, "Be reasonable," and the other says, 
"Be unreasonable." It's a matter of temperament, and there are many more of the 
first kind of person than of the second. But the world needs both. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovering," by Robert Scott Root-Bernstein, is an eloquent paean to the 
artists in science, the mavericks, misfits and free spirits. It is also an 
indictment of the current institutional structure of science, with its funding 
committees, peer reviews and demand for conformity. Under the present setup, 
caution is rewarded and new ideas are stifled. 
</P>
<P>
Befitting its message, "Discovering" is an unusual book. It is written in 
dialogue form, with six characters meeting over several weeks to talk about 
creativity and to try to understand it. This format enables Root-Bernstein to 
put various ideas in the mouths of his characters without necessarily endorsing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It also allows him to explore, brainstorm and toss out ideas without having to 
make a formal argument, which is very much what the book calls for in creative 
thought. As a result, "Discovering" is both an extended discussion of that 
point and an example of it. 
</P>
<P>
Root-Bernstein is an associate professor of physiology and natural science at 
Michigan State University and a former winner of a MacArthur Award -- the 
"genius award" -- from the MacArthur Fellows Program. He has written 
extensively on the subject of creativity, and here he draws together his 
extensive thinking on the subject. The result is an intriguing and 
extraordinarily important book. 
</P>
<P>
"Most pioneering or breakthrough scientists would not have been able to curry 
favor under our present system," one of his characters observes near the end. 
"As far as I can tell, almost every major discovery has resulted from crackpot 
ideas or attempts to solve 'impossible' problems that no one took seriously at 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Another character observes: "If we clone scientists, we will produce cloned 
science. Clones are economical to produce but infuriatingly uniform in their 
patterns of work and thought, as the Soviet Union and Japan have found out. 
These nations produce many scientists, but few scientific breakthroughs. 
Science can never be organized like an assembly line. Unlike industry, it must 
strive for maximum diversity, not maximum uniformity." 
</P>
<P>
Root-Bernstein bolsters the point throughout the book with many historical 
examples and case studies. Progress is made by loners who shun the crowd -- and 
its rewards -- and insist on following their hunches and pursuing their 
insights. 
</P>
<P>
Such people rarely get warm receptions from the Establishment. As a result, 
they suffer for their choice. A large number of creative people experience 
depression. "These depressions and breakdowns seem to be related to a striving 
type of personality," one of the characters says. "It's not easy to be or to 
act differently from everyone else, but you can't create if you conform." 
</P>
<P>
The great advances in science are rarely made by people at blue-chip academic 
institutions, Root-Bernstein says. Einstein was a clerk at the Swiss patent 
office when he did his most important work in physics. And he is not a unique 
example. The people at the "important" places have internalized the status quo 
and have become cautious. That's how they got to be full professors at Harvard 
at age 35. The mavericks are elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The book explores whether creativity can be taught, and if so, how? It argues 
that discovery is a process, not an end, and it urges schools to teach broadly 
rather than narrowly. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the common themes running through the education of all creative people 
is an early experience with the creative process itself," one of the characters 
says. "It doesn't matter whether it's in poetry, music, painting, crafts, 
inventing or science itself: The act of creating something for yourself is an 
assertion that you are not afraid to test yourself against tradition, or to 
express your personal view of the world, despite the perils of any such 
endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
How to implement such an educational program is another matter. Just as most 
people wind up being plodders, most teachers are, too. Schools have been urged 
to foster creativity at least since the days of John Dewey -- without wide 
success. The drive for conformity begins in schools. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with Root-Bernstein's book is that he makes it seem that every 
crackpot is right, which is hardly the case. People with new and important 
things to say are likely to be shunned, but that does not mean that everyone 
who is shunned has new and important things to say. Most of them don't, but you 
wouldn't draw that conclusion from Root-Bernstein's book. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is how to know in advance which of the cacophony of crackpots is 
right. Every single one of them claims to be the new Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
But that caution aside, this book is a major contribution to understanding the 
creative process in individuals and institutions. It is a work of great insight 
and sweep, and it should be the manifesto of great changes in education and 
science. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it will be. Maybe.

MISS MANNERS: A LESSON IN VIRTUE AND REWARDS ON FIRST DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS 
</P>
<P>
A young lady who works with me said she had met a wonderful middle-aged man who 
so excited her that they became intimately involved on the first date -- but 
only after he had shown her the town, including dinner and dancing at a very 
expensive establishment. 
</P>
<P>
However, he had to leave her apartment earlier the next morning than she did, 
and after he had departed, she returned to her bedroom to find $50 in her 
dresser. Her evening of joy was suddenly transformed into feelings that 
bordered on outright hatred -- "How could he do something like this to me? What 
kind of lady did he take me for, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
The next time he called, one day later, she bawled him out and refused to see 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
Another lady at work said she would have seen him again so she could punch him 
in the face. 
</P>
<P>
A third lady, the ex-spouse of a multimillionaire, responded to the two younger 
ladies: "I'm old enough to be your mother, so I'm going to give you some 
advice. A lady never asks for money after such a romantic evening; however, 
should a gentleman offer money, she never refuses." 
</P>
<P>
Is the third lady correct? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Third lady? Miss Manners doesn't count any ladies in this 
anecdote. Neither, apparently, did the gentleman. You, at least, made a 
halfhearted attempt to convince Miss Manners that the person in question was so 
felled by overwhelming passion as to overcome the circumspect practices of an 
otherwise respectable life. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is not saying that you were successful. The mention of the 
expensive evening suggests that barter was indeed in her mind. But there seems 
to have been no such effort at persuading the gentleman, who therefore drew his 
own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps your young colleague believes that spending the night with a 
near-stranger is merely a conventional way of getting to know someone better. 
In that case, this experience should teach her that the belief is far from 
universal.

ERMA BOMBECK: A TASTE OF 'GOOD OLD DAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just imagine for a moment that each of you has a time capsule attached to your 
body. Contained within it is a memory of something that reflects the world in 
which you lived, something you want to remember. What do you think it would be? 
</P>
<P>
According to a limited, non-scientific sampling of readers throughout the 
years, the answer is "food." Man's fondest memories have revolved around it. 
How it tasted. How it smelled. It has been the one thing that has changed the 
most dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The slightest mention of the "good old days" (30 years prior to wherever you 
are now) triggers stories of "juicy white corn on the cob with butter dripping 
off your elbow" . . . "sweet strawberries as big as your fist" . . . and those 
wonderful tender fryers that tasted like real chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Anderson of Tularosa, N.M., asks, "Why is it all a memory?" Specifically, 
he remembers watermelons (some weighing more than 50 pounds) being chilled in 
the ice house, awaiting the next day when the knife would reveal deep ravines 
of red, dotted with black seeds for spitting. "Watermelons are not bred for 
flavor anymore. They are bred for shipping. The test is to throw a ripe melon 
to the ground from the roof of the barn. If it bounces without breaking the 
skin, save the seeds! 
</P>
<P>
"Opening a watermelon today is about like getting at a coconut that has just 
fallen from the tree," he complains. "One needs a heavy-duty knife. (A machete 
is adequate.) Lay the edge of the blade to the melon and rap soundly on the 
backside of the knife with a four-pound hammer. If a crack appears in the 
melon, insert a log-splitting wedge and whack again. The last two melons we 
bought at the grocery had the consistency of winter squash, the color of 
chicken lungs and tasted like cucumbers. We took them next door and gave them 
to the neighbor's chickens." 
</P>
<P>
I have to agree. I don't remember my mother's chicken dressed in a caftan of 
fat that you could peel off in one piece. Or fresh peaches that taste a lot 
like the back of a postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
Food today is like a highway under construction: You travel at your own risk. 
Add some oats, take out the salt, lower the fat, compress the nutrients, spray 
for disease, inject for longevity, corral the calories, remove the seeds, alter 
the color, and slap a label on it to let people know what it is supposed to be. 
Dispensing food is a matter of keeping it alive long enough to execute it. It's 
downright inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot that was bad about the "good old days." No one denies that. But 
I'd trade the beeper, the electric salad shooter, the stress tapes, the 
electric gum massager and my bifocal mirror for one large beefsteak tomato that 
oozes flavor and runs down your chin when you bite into it.

Rocky to Fight Yet Another Bout: Sylvester Stallone is going in for another 
round of struggle and success in the boxing ring. Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt 
Young and company will begin filming "Rocky V" in Philadelphia Jan. 15, Mayor 
W. Wilson Goode announced. 
</P>
<P>
The new film will feature the familiar formula -- fighting and winning. Rocky 
Balboa, perhaps Philadelphia's most famous resident since William Penn, faces 
his greatest challenge, producers say, a test that will pit him against his own 
values, strength and, ultimately, his own spirit. Boxing heavyweight contender 
Tommy Morrison is featured as Rocky's protege, Tommy Gun. John Alvidsen, who 
directed the first "Rocky" in Philadelphia in 1975 with the then-unknown 
Stallone, will direct the fourth sequel and filming is expected to last about 
six weeks. SHAUNA SNOW

Baccarat Table to Be Installed at LACMA: A dazzling crystal table, made in the 
mid-19th Century at the Baccarat French crystal house, is being installed today 
in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's decorative arts galleries. The 
5x3-foot table is a longterm loan from Los Angeles collectors Arthur and 
Rosalinde Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
The crystal table formerly belonged to Liberace. Asprey galleries of London 
bought it for $44,000 in Los Angeles at an April, 1988, auction of the late 
singer's collection. The Gilberts subsequently purchased the table from Asprey 
for an undisclosed price. Reproductions of baccarat tables are occasionally 
offered for sale but, according to the museum, the only other known original is 
in the collection of the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y. SHAUNA SNOW

New Theater Group to Hit Town: Dan Lauria, who plays the grumpy Dad on "The 
Wonder Years," will direct PKE Theatre, a new theater group that is being 
completely funded by Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment, the Culver City company 
that produced the TV movie "Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" and the 
upcoming TV series "Working Girl." With a budget of $100,000 from partners Tom 
Patchett and Ken Kaufman, PKE will stage four plays during the next year, using 
rented theaters; the first will be "Old Friends," opening March 1 at the 
Callboard Theatre in West Hollywood. Last year Lauria used his own "Wonder 
Years" money to co-produce two smaller-theater hits, "A Bronx Tale" and "What 
Everywoman Knows." SHAUNA SNOW

KECK GRANT TO ORANGE COUNTY ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The W. M. Keck Foundation has awarded $1 million to the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center's Endowment Fund, Center officials announced Monday. The 
grant will be used to launch a campaign to increase the endowment's cash assets 
from the current $3 million (including the Keck grant) to $12 million by the 
end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The gift represents a "major step forward" in financial stability for the Costa 
Mesa Center, which uses endowment funds for programming and operating costs, 
said Center Chairman Henry T. Segerstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"Building the cash in the endowment broadens our financial support base so we 
don't have to depend so heavily on ticket sales and can perhaps engage in more 
(artistically) daring" programs and exercise "more flexibility" in programming, 
Segerstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
At present, about $70 million has been committed to the Center's Endowment 
Fund, established in 1982, primarily in deferred estate gifts such as will 
bequests, Center officials report. But these funds are not expected to be 
converted into cash assets for 20 to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In considering the gift to the Center, which was created and sustained entirely 
by private sector funds, "we were particularly impressed by the way people of 
the area have rallied to build and support this marvelous facility," said David 
A. Thomas, chairman of the W. M. Keck Foundation's Southern California Program 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also said that though it is unrestricted, the grant is an attempt "to 
encourage continued development" of arts education and community outreach, a 
particular focus of the Los Angeles-based foundation which limits its arts 
support to Southern California. The Center currently sponsors several 
educational programs of its own plus helps subsidize others presented by 
regional groups using the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We depend on (foundation grant recipients) to ever expand their educational 
outreach programs even though our grants are not necessarily directly tied to 
their expansion," Thomas said. The foundation has made similar gifts to the 
Museum of Contemporary Art ($2.2 million in 1988), the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
($1.2 million in 1988) and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra ($100,000 in 
1989.) 
</P>
<P>
The W. M. Keck Foundation, which has donated more than $24 million to arts and 
culture in Southern California since 1980, contributed $1 million to 
construction of the $73.7-million Center in 1983. The foundation annually gives 
a total of $35 million to support a wide range of needs nationwide in addition 
to arts and culture. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation was established in 1954 as a grant-making entity by the late W. 
M. Keck, founder of the Superior Oil Co. Its primary focus is support for 
science, engineering and medical research.

NO MORE TOMORROWS FOR DAWN STEEL AT COLUMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: RESIGNATION BY STUDIO PRESIDENT ENDS MONTHS OF SPECULATION ABOUT HER 
FATE AFTER SONY CORP. TAKEOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dawn Steel is hobbling around these days, sporting crutches and a leg brace in 
the wake of a holiday ski accident. Still, insists the president of Columbia 
Pictures, she feels lighter than she has in years. 
</P>
<P>
After months of speculation about her fate in the wake of the Sony Corp. 
purchase of the studio in September, it's now official: Steel turned in her 
resignation on Monday from the post she has held since November, 1987, and will 
be staying on as a consultant for a transitional period. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't resign from these jobs . . . you escape from them," says Steel, the 
industry's first female studio chief and a former head of production at 
Paramount. "I feel like I've been let out of a cage. The higher up you get, the 
more administrative and less creative it is. There's much less interrelating 
with film makers which is what I loved about my previous jobs. It's a lot less 
about hands-on day-to-day film making. I felt completely unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do this job another minute," Steel continues. "I'm grateful 
for the opportunity and am glad I took it on, but I don't want to read another 
script on a weekend. I'm tired of being the bad guy all the time, saying 'no' 
to people I like. No one calls to say, 'Have a nice day'." 
</P>
<P>
Steel's plans are still up in the air. Despite rumors that she has accepted an 
independent production deal at Disney, Fox, Universal or Warner Bros., Steel 
says legal considerations precluded having any substantive conversations until 
now. The reported $7 million in stock options she walked away with in the Sony 
deal gives her plenty of time to decide. Columbia declined to discuss the 
particulars of her departure. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is up in the air. One thing I know for sure: I won't head back to 
the executive suite. It's time to get on the other side of the desk, to 
exercise the right side of my brain. Another is that I won't be teaming up with 
my husband (producer Charles Roven, "Heart Like a Wheel"). Working together is 
the quickest road to marital problems." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of Steel's departure began to surface shortly after Sony handed the reins 
of the company over to producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters last October. 
Though Steel has a long-term relationship with them both -- dating back to the 
time they all worked on "Flashdance" at Paramount -- their presence, it was 
clear, would intrude upon the autonomy previously guaranteed her by Chairman 
Victor Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
When Steel projects such as "Skirts" and "Shining Through" (based on the Susan 
Isaacs novel) were placed in turnaround by the new Guber-Peters team, industry 
insiders were certain a change was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Though Steel will walk away with bonuses and an undisclosed cash settlement due 
her under the terms of her initial contract, the stumbling blocks were less 
pecuniary than legal -- specifically a "confidentiality" clause (which Steel 
refused to sign) and a "no raid" provision that prevented her from taking 
employees with her ("negotiated down to nothing"). "The issue wasn't money," 
she says. "I would have left for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Steel's track record at the studio has been the subject of debate. Some critics 
charge that, despite the five-month writers' strike, more films should have 
been set in motion. Those she did green-light, it was pointed out, were less 
successful than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Brian DePalma's "Casualties of War," budgeted at $23 million, took in a mere 
$19 million at the box office ("a difficult film, a disappointment," Steel 
admits) while "Karate Kid III" and "Ghostbusters II" grossed $40 million and 
$112 million, respectively. Hits, any way you cut it, but significantly less 
profitable than the originals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you combine the grosses of Tri Star and Columbia, we finished in third 
place this year -- a fact of which I'm very proud," says Steel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also proud of the talent I brought in -- Michael Douglas, Cher, Mike 
Nichols -- and the fact that we got Penny Marshall's 'Great Awakenings' 
starring Robin Williams away from Fox. I think we built a terrific marketing 
group and production team." 
</P>
<P>
Her legacy? "I'd like my epitaph to read 'Given the amount of time she had, she 
did the best job she could.' Also that I'm a nice person . . . and a good 
mother. I wouldn't want anyone to think that work is the major thing in my 
life."

BURNETT DELIVERING A NEW PUNCH LINE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: COMEDY VETERAN HOPES TO CREATE A NEW KIND OF HUMOR IN 'CAROL &amp; 
COMPANY.' NBC TENTATIVELY PLANS TO INTRODUCE SERIES IN THE SPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of seasons ago, some clever TV industry-watcher coined the term 
"dramedy" to describe those half-hour, one-camera filmed programs that blended 
comedy and drama, and dared the audience to figure out which was which without 
a laugh track to guide the way. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a name yet for the new kind of TV comedy that Carol Burnett wants 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett and her producers -- "Roseanne" creator Matt Williams and former KTTV 
Channel 11 news anchor Marcia Brandwynne -- hope to create a new form of comedy 
when Burnett returns to television in "Carol &amp; Company," a half-hour series 
that NBC tentatively plans to introduce in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The show, Burnett, Williams and Brandwynne said recently, will follow the 
sitcom tradition of using a studio audience -- but there the similarity ends. 
Each week's installment will feature Burnett playing a different character in a 
different story, with a group of regular players also performing different 
roles week to week. There also will be occasional guest stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company" will differ from Burnett's 1967-1979 variety series, "The 
Carol Burnett Show," by presenting only one story a week rather than a 
collection of sketches. Each episode will be prefaced by an informal 
introduction by Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming up with a whole new set of characters, and whole new story, every 
week -- it is a bear," Burnett acknowledged in a recent conversation at the 
offices of Matt Williams' company, Wind Dancer. (The show is a co-production of 
Wind Dancer, Burnett's Kalola Productions and Disney Productions Inc.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's ever been tried before," she said. "There have been 
anthology series, but they were done on film, and they were not necessarily 
attempting to be funny every week. We are doing this live, in front of an 
audience -- it's a risk." 
</P>
<P>
It's also proving to be very difficult. Initially, the show didn't feature a 
repertory company, but production was shut down after the first four episodes 
because the producers said they decided they needed one. A source within Disney 
said the first episodes had serious script and production problems, and 
performed poorly with test audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In shows taped thus far, Burnett appears as an eccentric who "totally believes 
that an alien ship is going to pick her up at 11 o'clock," an aging soap opera 
star who is about to be fired and a Southern woman devoted to saving her 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett and Brandwynne called delays and script changes a natural part of 
developing a new format. They said that the first four episodes will not be 
scrapped, although they may be scattered throughout the season. "It's a 
birthing process -- it's not something that is a smooth road," Brandwynne said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of 'trouble,' I'd say we're in labor," Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the search for a repertory company, Burnett said, the only other 
major change since the show began taping is her introduction, which went from 
the type of glamorous beginning appropriate for the big-stage "Carol Burnett 
Show" to a more informal, intimate greeting befitting the new program, taped at 
Disney in a 180-seat theater created for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett added that she would rather take these sorts of risks than be locked 
into the cozy living room of a family situation comedy or try to recapture the 
style of "The Carol Burnett Show." 
</P>
<P>
"I've done variety, and I didn't want to do sitcom because I didn't want to 
play the same character all the time," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a "Cosby Show" veteran who was fired as executive producer of 
"Roseanne" during its first season because of conflicts with the star, Roseanne 
Barr, agreed that he's had enough of the sitcom for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
"On a sitcom, you begin to ask yourself, 'Now, what's a (scene) we can do in 
the kitchen that we haven't already done seven times before?' " he said. "It 
would be easier to do a sitcom where Carol plays the wacky cleaning lady who 
runs this house with two smart aleck kids and crazy neighbors, but I don't want 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Although old "Carol Burnett Show" standbys such as Harvey Korman, Vicki 
Lawrence and Tim Conway may appear as guests on the new series, viewers should 
not expect a "Carol Burnett Show" reunion, Burnett said. "It's a different 
show, with different people." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the risk of introducing a new format, Burnett also faces the 
possibility that audiences will not accept her in something different from "The 
Carol Burnett Show." Last season, two other comedy veterans, Dick Van Dyke and 
Mary Tyler Moore, failed in new comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said she does not see "Carol &amp; Company" as her "return" to TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt that I went off; I just sort of stopped,' she said. "I like TV 
work, and this just sort of appealed to me. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a crap shoot. And if it doesn't succeed, at least we'll know it 
didn't fail because we didn't try something different."

CRITIC AT LARGE: 'CONVERSATIONS': THE CAMERA AS HOUSE GUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far as I know, Mark Twain was the first American author to be captured by 
the motion picture camera. There is brief footage of him, in the familiar white 
suit on the veranda of his house in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
In a new day, hardly anyone will escape not just the camera but the sound 
camera, recording our unscripted inanities on Christmas morning. Yet for 
historians as well as sentimental descendants there will come to exist a body 
of film and tape about the celebrated and the uncelebrated that will let 
tomorrow know just how yesterday sounded and looked and moved and thought. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Colbert of Santa Barbara came to know John Huston and John Houseman in 
their last years. She and they were friends of Howard Koch, the writer who 
turned a vigorous 87 last month and who wrote the script for Orson Welles' 
famous or infamous "War of the Worlds" broadcast and later was one of the 
writers on "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
During visits Koch made to Santa Barbara in the late '80s, Colbert arranged 
reunions with the three old friends, sat them in front of a camera and simply 
let them talk as long as they would. The hours of talk have been professionally 
edited into a documentary she calls "Last Conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Colbert is not a film maker; nothing fancy here. The camera is a watching guest 
as the men become their own interrogators. Houseman, quite in character, 
vigorously takes charge and in effect interviews Koch about his troubles with 
Jack Warner, who begged Koch to write "Mission to Moscow" and a few years later 
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities cited it as evidence of 
Communist influence in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Koch remembers a night in 1935 when a play he had written about Abraham Lincoln 
was set to go, except that they could not find a Lincoln. "Then late one night, 
a tall young man appeared at the door of our New York apartment, during a 
torrential rainstorm. He was hatless, no raincoat, no umbrella. It was as if 
he'd been driven in by the storm. I didn't even know whether he'd ever acted 
before, but after 15 minutes with him I knew that we'd found our Lincoln, a 
gift from Pluto, the God of Storms." 
</P>
<P>
It was Huston, who had just returned from a rather roustabout life in London 
where, he once claimed, he had got by by doing sidewalk sketches. He had met 
the director, who steered him to Koch. The play had a brief run. The Wall 
Street Journal review, Huston recalls, was unsympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Of the HUAC times, Huston tells his friend, "I must say you were very valiant, 
one of the very rare exceptions, a man who was not a Communist and yet took a 
stand against the persecution." 
</P>
<P>
Houseman and Koch met during the Welles days in 1937 and were talking again a 
half-century later. Koch says he envied Houseman's many-faceted career. "Not a 
virtue, you know," Houseman says. "I did that out of sheer cowardice. I was so 
terrified of failing in one and starving to death that I always hedged my bets 
and had two or three things ready to fall into if I flopped in one of them. . . 
. And in general I lived very much for the moment. . . . That's the only way 
you can do that kind of mad and comprehensive career." 
</P>
<P>
The two men discuss the doing of "War of the Worlds" and its aftermath, when in 
Houseman's view, the press, feeling itself threatened by radio, were eager to 
prove the medium irresponsible. There were so many false reports of deaths 
caused by panic during the broadcast that, Houseman says, "By the time we left 
the place that night we were literally convinced we were mass murderers." 
</P>
<P>
Koch, says Houseman at the end of the conversation, "is one of the pure in 
heart. . . . (He) has been consistently idealistic and consistently optimistic. 
This of course is a great error because the world isn't that way but Howard 
continues to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Visible as well in the film, although briefly, is Maricela Hernandez, the woman 
in Huston's life during his last years and to whom he dedicated his last film, 
"The Dead." She had met Huston when she was the maid for his fifth wife, 
Celeste, and went to live with them at Huston's castle in Ireland. When the 
stormy marriage broke up, Hernandez and Huston stayed in touch. 
</P>
<P>
She was with him when he died. In a scene that was memorably described by 
Anjelica Huston at her father's memorial service, he suddenly asked Hernandez 
how many rifles they had ready. Having played fantasy games with him before, 
Hernandez said 30. And ammo? Plenty, she said. "Good!" he said, "Give 'em hell" 
and lifted her hand and died. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez lives in a small house in Hollywood where they spent their last 
years, with frequent trips to a house Huston also gave her in Puerto Vallarta 
(not the seaside house which will eventually revert to the Indians whose land 
it is on). 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his life, having made efforts to help his children in their 
careers (Anjelica with "Prizzi's Honor," Tony with "The Dead," Danny with "Mr. 
North"), Huston had advice for Hernandez. He assembled a library for her and 
urged her to read and study. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about the biographers who might be eager to invade their privacy, 
Hernandez remarked during a recent luncheon with Pauline Colbert and a friend, 
Huston had further counsel. "Let the dogs bark; just don't let 'em bite you," 
Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Conversations" awaits a distributor or a televised playdate. It is what 
it is, a charming, affectionate and valuable glimpse of three invaluable 
artists.

COLOMBIA SPLIT REPORTED OVER U.S. DRUG MOVE

<P>
An argument apparently is under way in the government over increased U.S. naval 
activity in the Caribbean against drug traffickers, which President Virgilio 
Barco Vargas is said to favor. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has said it is increasing air and sea patrols in 
international waters, and protests came Monday from the opposition 
Conservatives and leftist Patriotic Union Party in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a local radio station reported that Foreign Minister Julio 
Londono Paredes was resigning because he did not have full government backing 
when he harshly criticized Washington's move to send the warships as well as 
its invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate official comment on the resignation report, which said 
that Londono will meet soon with Barco to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion over Colombia's position on the U.S. action resulted from a Sunday 
statement by Londono that the government rejects any attempt to search 
Colombian ships. Some international news reports, based on Londono's comments, 
interpreted that to mean Barco was angry with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
La Prensa, a Bogota newspaper with access to presidential advisers, said Monday 
that the problem appears to be within the Colombian government and stems from a 
dispute between Barco and Londono. Barco has said nothing so far and his office 
has issued no statements. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat with the U.S. Embassy said Monday that Barco had not sent a protest 
note or objected in any other way to the increase of Caribbean patrols. 
According to La Prensa, the president accepts the U.S. action while Londono 
never has been pro-American on any international issue. 
</P>
<P>
The falling out began with the U.S. invasion of Panama, La Prensa said. It 
suggested that Barco supported the invasion and his foreign minister was 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Londono arrived home from a vacation Sunday and said in response to reporters' 
questions at the airport: "The Colombian government does not accept, nor will 
it ever accept, any type of interference with ships carrying the Colombian flag 
on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
"Any type of interference on the high seas would need the authorization of the 
Colombian government, especially of the Ministry of Defense." 
</P>
<P>
When Barco's office was asked if that was the official Colombian position and 
whether Barco was upset about not being told in advance that a U.S. task force 
would sail into the Caribbean, spokesman Julio Carlos Gonzalez said that Barco 
had no official comment. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion about Colombia's official position was a report Sunday 
by the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo that Barco's office had issued a statement 
saying that Colombia would not contribute warships to the U.S. effort in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, the Barco spokesman, said that El Tiempo's story was not based on any 
Barco statement because none had been issued.

The Organization of American States expressed deep concern Monday over the 
entrance of U.S. troops into the Nicaraguan embassy residence in Panama last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved 19-0 with the United States and six other countries 
abstaining, was a watered-down version of a Nicaraguan proposal to declare the 
Dec. 29 incident a flagrant violation of international law. 
</P>
<P>
Canada, in its first vote since formally becoming an OAS member earlier in the 
day, joined the Latin American and Caribbean nations who expressed concern over 
the U.S. action, which occurred during the invasion to oust Panamanian military 
ruler Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution declared that the entrance by U.S. troops into the Nicaraguan 
embassy residence was a violation of diplomatic privileges and immunities but 
took note of a formal U.S. statement regretting the incident.

American Airlines Had Best On-Time Record: The airline with the best on-time 
flight performance in November was American and the carrier with the worst

The 12 largest U.S. carriers reported that 78% of their flights operated on 
time in November, below their 79.5% on-time performance in October. The 
department said consumers registered 1,125 complains against airlines in 
November, down from 1,143 in October.

Consumer Credit Up at 7.2% Rate: Americans took out $4.24 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in November, the largest increase in their 
outstanding debt in nine months, the Federal Reserve reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the jump reflected overall consumer optimism despite pockets 
of sluggishness in the economy. The Fed said consumer credit in November 
advanced at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2% on top of a 5.4% gain in 
October. It was the highest level of consumer debt since last February, when 
$5.38 billion was posted.

Continental Cuts Fares Again: Continental Airlines, which last week raised 
fares by 4%, said it would offer one-way tickets to and from Texas cities for 
as low as $9 to fill seats that otherwise would be empty. "It's a whole lot 
more productive to put somebody in a seat at $9 or $19 than to have that seat 
go empty," said John Nelson, Continental's executive vice president of 
marketing. The new fares, dubbed "TexSavers," are good for travel between all 
Texas cities Continental serves, except El Paso, and for travel between Houston 
and New Orleans, Oklahoma City and Tulsa.

Home Affordability Index Steady: The percentage of California households able 
to afford the median priced home remained constant at 19% in November, 
according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Although housing prices increased slightly during the month, mortgage rates 
declined, offsetting the increase. The state's median-priced home now sells for 
$195,400, up from $193,557 in October. Only 14% of the households can afford 
the median-priced home in Los Angeles, which sells for $224,625, or the 
median-priced home in Orange County, which goes for $242,765.

RADICAL CHANGES EXPECTED IN EAST BLOC TRADING GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
TRADING: MEMBER NATIONS OF COMECON ARE DEMANDING AN END TO OUTDATED AND 
INEFFICIENT AGREEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Member nations of the Soviet-led trading group Comecon begin a crucial two-day 
meeting here today that is expected to radically alter both the form and role 
of the organization, which has come to symbolize the economic failures of 
Communist central planning. 
</P>
<P>
New, reform-minded governments in several East European countries have demanded 
an end to the fossilized trading arrangements and other restrictions that have 
dominated Comecon and strangled growth virtually since its inception 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the group does decide to liberalize, it would almost certainly free its 
members to increase trade with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's new finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, last week even suggested 
that the organization be scrapped completely. However, he later backed away 
from the comment, and on the eve of the Sofia meeting none of Comecon's nine 
other members have openly supported outright abolition. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the current meeting is intended to bring economic realities in 
the region more in line with political change that has transformed the nations 
of Eastern Europe from a group of obedient Communist satellites of the Soviet 
Union to independent, almost democratic countries with free-market aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Soviet officials have also indicated the need to reform Comecon, which 
is formally named the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or CMEA. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Soviet Union and the six East European countries of Poland, 
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria, Comecon also 
includes Mongolia, Cuba and Vietnam, although the three non-European members 
play only a minor role. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become old and should be replaced by a new structure," Sergel Ouganov, 
a member of the Soviet advance delegation to the meeting, told reporters here 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Hungary and Poland, in addition to those in the Soviet Union, have 
talked of scrapping the basic underpinnings of Comecon, including such features 
as integrated five-year economic plans with in-built specialization (where one 
country produces the lion's share of a product for the entire bloc); barter 
arrangements; unrealistic, arbitrary pricing, and the use of the so-called 
convertible ruble as a common unit of account -- a unit that neither exists as 
a currency nor is convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly powerful reformist sentiments in Eastern Europe see such a system 
as obsolete, frequently counterproductive and occasionally nonsensical. 
</P>
<P>
These reformists, including the new crop of free-market government ministers in 
key countries, also view Comecon as one of the single-biggest barriers to 
launching the process of boosting trade with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Reformists are expected to push to replace the present system with more 
conventional bilateral trade agreements, which would diminish the role of 
government agencies and permit incentives to produce world-class goods. 
</P>
<P>
East Europeans quickly learned that the Soviets would take almost anything, 
while their Comecon partners had no other choice but to take what was offered. 
</P>
<P>
In such a climate, cheap oil and other basic materials merely bred inefficient 
fuel use and production methods. Power plants in Czechoslovakia, for example, 
require roughly three times the fuel to produce a unit of energy as their most 
efficient Western counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Such a malaise quickly left these countries incapable of competing in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a handicapped class in a school of healthy students," commented 
Andrezej Wroblewski, a Polish political analyst. "Sure, we are hard-pressed to 
come up with anything (of) high value-added to export. If not (for) the 
exchange among us handicapped ones, how would we exist? We barter junk for 
junk." 
</P>
<P>
This week's meeting was initially scheduled for last June but has been 
repeatedly postponed, apparently because members were unable to bridge the gap 
between reformist governments and the remaining hard-line Communist regimes. 
With the fall of Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu last month, the group's last major 
hard-liner disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last spring, for instance, a Czechoslovak trading official spoke 
unrealistically of Comecon as "a Socialist market that does not contain 
unemployment and bankruptcies." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Klaus, the new Czechoslovak finance minister, is an advocate of 
the policies of American economist Milton Friedman, the arch proponent of 
free-market forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMECON AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Charter: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is the controlling body for 
trade among Soviet-allied countries. 
</P>
<P>
Members: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 
Soviet Union. Yugoslavia has partial member status; Albania has been inactive 
since 1961. Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam are not shown. 
</P>
<P>
Founded: Charter adopted in January, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Purposes: Economic development; scientific, technical and economic cooperation; 
joint trade negotiations with non-members. 
</P>
<P>
Policy-making bodies: Council comprises heads of governments; executive 
committee of country representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Developments: Members, meeting in Bulgaria beginning today, will address the 
political and economic reforms that have swept Eastern Europe, prompting calls 
from Czechoslovakia and Poland for a major overhaul. The alliance, they say, is 
outdated and should be replaced with something less rigid.

Intel Says New Supercomputer Rivals Cray's: Intel Corp. unveiled a 
supercomputer that industry analysts said should gain a share of the growing 
business but is unlikely to hurt market leader Cray Research. Intel said its 
iPSC/860 machine would offer performance to rival the Cray Y-MP supercomputer 
at one-tenth the price, but analysts said it was aiming more at commercial 
users rather than Cray's traditional research base. Intel said aircraft 
manufacturer Boeing Co. had already decided to buy the machine, which will be 
available in quantity by March starting at $265,000.

Maxicare Files Reorganization Plan: Maxicare Health Plans formally filed a 
previously announced proposed plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Santa Ana. The Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization, 
which last March filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings, has proposed to distribute cash, notes and a new issue 
of common stock to satisfy creditor claims. If approved, health-care providers 
would become Maxicare's major stockholders.

PACIFIC TELESIS TO BUY BACK 25 MILLION OF ITS SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Telesis said Monday that it plans to buy back up to 25 million shares 
of its common stock, a $1.2-billion undertaking at current market prices and 
the largest repurchase plan in the company's six-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based parent of Pacific Bell has already repurchased 30 
million of its own shares since October, 1987, but that was accomplished 
through three separate buyback programs of 10 million shares each. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that repurchasing our stock at current prices is a very 
good investment for our share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific Telesis chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Ginn said the purchase will be financed through the company's own funds as well 
as short-term borrowings. Shares will be bought in the open market and through 
private negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sazegari, senior telecommunications analyst for the Dataquest research 
firm in San Jose, said the company apparently decided that shareholders would 
benefit more from a higher market value for their holdings than from increasing 
current dividend payments. Buying up the shares will also enable Pacific 
Telesis to distribute stock under a recently announced employee stock purchase 
plan without creating a new issue, he added. 
</P>
<P>
There were 416.3 million shares of Pacific Telesis common stock outstanding at 
the end of 1989. The latest buyback program would reduce that to 391.3 million 
shares, close to the 385.7 million shares outstanding at the end of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Since Pacific Telesis stock began trading Nov. 21, 1983 -- in anticipation of 
the company's takeover of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's local phone 
businesses in California and Nevada on Jan. 1, 1984 -- its common stock has 
generated a total return (price appreciation plus dividends) of 335% through 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $49 per share, up $1.25, in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Monday.

CAMPEAU BOARD MEETS IN SEARCH FOR SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: DIRECTORS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO SEEK BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION FOR 
DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS. THE FATE OF BLOOMINGDALE'S IS UP IN THE AIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of Campeau Corp., facing mounting pressure to seek bankruptcy court 
protection for their big department store divisions, huddled late into the 
night Monday to try to come up with a way to deal with the company's financial 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
The Campeau board met amid indications that the company may put on a back 
burner its efforts to sell Bloomingdale's, the crown jewel of its vast 
retailing empire. Sources close to Campeau also speculated that the board was 
wrestling with the issue of who controls the company, most of whose stock is 
divided among several large shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sanger, a Campeau spokeswoman, termed "unfounded" a report in London's 
Financial Times that her company already has taken the 17-store Bloomingdale's 
chain off the market because the offers have been too low. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the negotiations speculated that Campeau officials 
are reconsidering their plans for Bloomingdale's. They explained that 
prospective buyers appear to have been frightened off by the possibility that a 
deal could eventually be voided or altered by a bankruptcy judge. Campeau 
reportedly has asked $1.2 billion for the chain, but sources say the 
preliminary offers have been less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be extremely difficult for anybody to acquire Bloomingdale's with the 
specter of bankruptcy hanging over Campeau," said Gilbert W. Harrison, chairman 
of Financo, a New York investment banking firm that specializes in the 
retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau announced plans to sell Bloomingdale's in September as part of a 
reorganization intended to rescue the giant Toronto-based real estate and 
retailing company. The company has been struggling to cope with $7.4 billion in 
takeover debts from its acquisition of Allied Stores in 1986 and Federated 
Department Stores in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Campeau disclosed that its Allied and Federated department store 
divisions might have to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code early this year. Under Chapter 11, a company is able 
to remain in business and reorganize its operations while protected from the 
threat of lawsuits by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Campeau is the second-largest department store organization in the 
United States, there are no Allied or Federated outlets in Southern California. 
Its only retail operation in the region is Ralphs supermarkets, and that chain 
would not be included in the possible bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
During the next week, Allied and Federated face two key deadlines in dealing 
with their creditors, fueling speculation that a Chapter 11 filing could come 
within days. On Wednesday, payments are due on merchandise received by Campeau 
stores as of the month ended Dec. 20. If the stores file for bankruptcy court 
protection quickly, they could temporarily put off those debts and keep the 
cash they received from selling the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a banking syndicate led by New York's Citibank has threatened to 
declare $2.34 billion in Allied and Federated loans in default unless the 
companies meet certain conditions by Monday. At that point, the banks could 
demand that Allied and Federated pay off the loans early, a move that almost 
certainly would force the department store companies into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Apparel manufacturers and other department store suppliers in recent weeks have 
held off shipments to Allied and Federated operations out of fear that they 
will go into bankruptcy and not pay their existing debts. As a result, the 
Allied and Federated stores may be badly short of spring merchandise unless the 
stores can assure suppliers that payments will be made. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a Chapter 11 filing could provide that assurance because orders 
shipped after a bankruptcy petition is made would have the first claim on the 
department stores' assets. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, analysts say, a bankruptcy filing could scare off customers. 
Campeau officials, they suggested, have also resisted filing for bankruptcy 
because of the uncertainty of what could happen once the company's operations 
are under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.

MARKETING: HOW MAJOR ADVERTISERS ARE HOPING TO SCORE BIG ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one -- absolutely no one -- wants to see more points scored in this year's 
Super Bowl than Larry Kraines. 
</P>
<P>
You probably haven't heard of Kraines or his Compton company, Kraco 
Enterprises. But on Jan. 28, Super Bowl Sunday, Kraco -- which makes auto floor 
mats -- will see its name plastered on a scoreboard in the Louisiana Superdome, 
just like advertising giants Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Marlboro. And each time 
there's a touchdown or field goal, millions of TV viewers may see Kraco's name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got lucky," understated Kraines. After all, that prime scoreboard 
space is usually reserved informally as a special perk for the world's biggest 
advertisers. In fact, said the president of one major company that sells 
scoreboard advertising space nationally, "If these Kraco guys even get a couple 
of flashes on the screen, they've made the deal of the century." 
</P>
<P>
While Kraco has managed to link its name with the Super Bowl for an estimated 
$20,000, advertisers will spend more than $60 million for Super Bowl exposure. 
This year, 30-second TV spots on the Super Bowl are selling for up to a record 
$700,000 each. Anheuser-Busch boasts that it plans to spend more than $7 
million on Super Bowl commercials alone. And Coke, meanwhile, was so concerned 
about locating certain long-lost actors to appear in its remake of a famous ad 
from two decades ago that it hired a private detective agency to find them. 
</P>
<P>
Sound a little loony? Well, for a chance to score big during the Super Bowl, 
many advertisers say they will do just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the happening," said Mike Ray, marketing professor at Stanford University 
in Palo Alto. "And the results can be catalytic. Besides the millions of people 
who see Super Bowl ads, even those who don't see the commercials will probably 
find out about them by word of mouth or by reading about them the next day." 
The day after last year's Super Bowl, USA Today published a story that had 
consumers rate each commercial aired during the game. 
</P>
<P>
By most estimates, nearly half the households in America will tune in to view 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a forum for ads," said John Rinek, national ad manager at Nissan, 
which will advertise heavily on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest event of the year," adds Michele Szynal, a spokesman for 
Gillette Co., which has three new ads on tap for the Super Bowl. "Gillette 
couldn't target its audience any better than this." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, high costs have persuaded a growing number of advertisers to 
purchase 30-second spots. And in an increasingly familiar action, several 
advertisers -- including Michelin and International Business Machines -- have 
bowed out because of the high prices. So, a smaller number of advertisers will 
use a bigger portion of commercial air time for this year's game. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest spender, hands down, will be Anheuser-Busch. "If you're going to be 
there," explained Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser, "you 
really need to be there big time to make it pay off." 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, Budweiser will air six spots -- spaced throughout 
the game -- in a mock tournament called "Bud Bowl II." The ads use a process 
called photo-animation that makes the beer bottles appear to move around on an 
animated football field. Last year, the Budweiser brand beat the Bud Light 
label. Executives refuse to divulge what will happen this year. To keep word 
from leaking, Budweiser's ad agency has actually filmed several different 
endings and only a few key executives know which ending will be aired on game 
day. 
</P>
<P>
And if you think that big advertisers are the only ones to take marketing moves 
like the "Bud Bowl" seriously, consider that last year Las Vegas odds makers 
actually posted odds on who would win the first "Bud Bowl" match-up. 
</P>
<P>
But plenty of other Super Bowl advertisers have big things up their sleeves, 
too. Tops among them is Nike, which hopes that its newest commercial featuring 
star athletes and famous sports announcers -- scheduled to premiere during the 
game -- will attract the same kind of media attention as its "Bo knows 
baseball" spot that premiered during baseball's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan has spent nearly $1 million to create a special ad for its 300 ZX Turbo. 
In the ad, the car manages to outrun a couple of menacing motorcyclists, a 
formula race car -- and finally a fighter jet. Pontiac will premiere a 
commercial set in the West that introduces its new minivan and another that 
unveils its newest Grand Prix model. Gillette will also launch a new product -- 
its Sensor shaver -- in several spots. And Pepsi has a new ad with Michael J. 
Fox that it will premiere -- along with two other spots with 
yet-to-be-announced celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Coke, meanwhile, hopes to rebound from the somewhat embarrassing 3-D commercial 
that it aired during last year's Super Bowl. Viewers were asked to wear special 
3-D glasses to see the commercial, but some watchers complained that the 
commercial was so bad that it made little difference whether they wore their 
special goggles. Rival Pepsi even aired one ad that ridiculed Coke's 3-D 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
So this year, Coke reached back for a sure thing and remade the popular TV 
commercial that it first broadcast in 1971, featuring a throng of young people 
on a hilltop singing the words, "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke." The new ad 
features many of the same people -- along with their children. 
</P>
<P>
But Coke had a hard time finding several key singers from the old spot. So its 
ad firm hired the Pinkerton Detective Agency to locate them. Perhaps the most 
difficult to find was Linda Higson Neary, the British-born woman who opened the 
1971 spot with her solo lyric, "I'd like to buy the world a home, and furnish 
it with love." 
</P>
<P>
When all else failed, the agency placed an ad in the International Herald 
Tribune, which was spotted by a friend of Neary's who knew her whereabouts. 
Neary -- who appears in the new version along with her 10-year-old daughter -- 
was found just five days before the commercial was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, Coke plans to keep close tabs on those who appeared in its Super 
Bowl ads. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there's certainly going to be a major Super Bowl event in the year 
2000. "For that one," said Coke spokesman Bob Bertini, "maybe we could bring 
these people back with their grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star's Switch Means Pink Slips 
</P>
<P>
The toughest part of the advertising business is firing employees when a big 
account is lost. And Patrick King, who runs West Coast operations for AC&amp;R 
Advertising, is expected to deal with that thankless task this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect a few jobs will be lost," said King, chairman and chief executive of 
the Los Angeles agency that lost its portion of the Tri-Star pictures account 
late last month. "We don't know how many yet, but it will not be as many jobs 
as people expect." 
</P>
<P>
The exact size of the account has not been revealed. Industry sources estimate 
that it could be anywhere from $40 million to $150 million. But AC&amp;R did 
not create ads for Tri-Star -- nor did it buy network TV time. It mostly 
purchased spot TV time for the film company. 
</P>
<P>
King also denied rumors that AC&amp;R was considering closing its Los Angeles 
office -- which employs about 65 people. "All of our offices will remain open," 
said King, whose agency also has an Irvine office. "Closing any of them isn't 
even a consideration. We have lots of other clients." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles agency that inherited the Tri-Star business said it has little 
plans for expansion. "We'll probably add to our staff, but only five or six 
people," said Richard B. Edler, executive vice president of McCann-Erickson/Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
How did his agency celebrate the win? "We had to work over Christmas while 
everyone else was on vacation," said Edler. 
</P>
<P>
Some celebration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's Chiat to Do for an Encore? 
</P>
<P>
For adman Jay Chiat, the question for the 1990s might be, how can he possibly 
top his accomplishments of the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the trade magazine Advertising Age named his Venice firm, 
Chiat/Day/Mojo, the agency of the decade. And it also selected the "1984" 
commercial that his shop made for Apple Computer as the TV commercial of the 
decade. Jay Chiat was also named "Leader of the Decade" last week by the 
Western States Advertising Agencies Assn. 
</P>
<P>
What's left? Well, how about adman of century?

$248 MILLION DISTRIBUTED TO INVESTORS IN BOESKY FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan F. Boesky's main arbitrage fund has been liquidated and $248 million 
distributed to its limited partners to settle one of many claims against the 
former Wall Street speculator, attorneys said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some lawsuits against the partnership, CX Partners LP, have been 
settled and others placed on hold in Manhattan federal court, where more than 
two dozen class-action lawsuits against Boesky and affiliated entities await 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between CX Partners and its 46 investors was reached after more 
than three years of discussions and litigation dating to Boesky's November, 
1986, settlement of insider trading charges with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
David R. Herwitz, liquidating trustee for CX Partners, said the agreement was 
"a major step in the resolution of disputes stemming from Mr. Boesky's 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Still pending in the case that rocked Wall Street are completion of an SEC plan 
to use $50 million paid by Boesky to reimburse individual investors who can 
prove they were defrauded by his trading. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement liquidating CX Partners, formerly known as Ivan F. Boesky 
&amp; Co., most of the limited partners received 100% of their investment, 
Herwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The total equity investment in the fund, which Boesky formed in March, 1986, to 
invest in stocks of potential takeover targets, was $338 million. But Boesky 
and his wife surrendered all their interests in the enterprise and some 
partners did not receive full compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The limited partnerships included insurance companies, financial institutions 
and individual investors. Some future disbursements to the partnerships are 
possible, Herwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Other details of the agreement were not made public, but sources familiar with 
the case said the Boeskys' interest in the fund totaled around $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Guinness PLC, the largest holder in the fund with a $100-million stake, 
received just $37 million of its claim, said George Reycraft, a lawyer for the 
limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
Other large stakes in the fund reportedly included $28 million by Jeffrey M. 
Picower of New York, its largest investor; $10 million by Lincoln National Life 
Insurance Co.; $10 million by Britain's Water Authorities Superannuation Fund; 
and $6 million by New York investor Milton Dresner. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's settlement included an agreement with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
resolving a series of issues surrounding the limited partners' investments. 
Drexel had an $8-million equity stake in the Boesky fund and owned $20 million 
of its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Reycraft said Drexel received the full $20 million for the debt but no interest 
or any of its equity investment. Under the agreement, Drexel will be dropped as 
a defendant in the Boesky-related lawsuits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed with litigation 
against Boesky and others, including former Drexel financier Michael Milken and 
admitted securities felons Dennis B. Levine and Martin A. Siegel.

KOVIC ASKS FOR HELP IN CANDIDACY DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Kovic, the Vietnam veteran whose life story is told in the current film 
"Born on the Fourth of July," appealed to residents in Rep. Robert Dornan's 
(R-Garden Grove) congressional district Monday to help him decide whether he 
should run for the office. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who became a leading anti-war protester in the 1970s after he returned 
from Vietnam as a paraplegic, said in interviews and on a Los Angeles radio 
talk show Monday, "I am ready to serve my country again, but I cannot make this 
decision alone." 
</P>
<P>
"I am asking people to write me, to call me, to come up to me on the street; 
I'm not a professional politician, if I ran it would be as a 
citizen-representative, an everyday person," Kovic said in an interview. "I am 
someone who learned from my experience and turned that tragedy into a triumph. 
I would like my life and what I've done with my life to be an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic said he would decide whether to run for Congress by the end of February 
when he returns from a film festival in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As his associates disclosed last week, Kovic said he was approached in the fall 
by House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) and other national Democratic leaders 
who urged him to run against Dornan in Orange County's 38th Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to run in that district, the distinction between me and the current 
incumbent could not be more clear," Kovic said. "I feel he appeals to people's 
fears, while I would appeal to their hopes and dreams for a better America." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan responded Monday that "the fear (Kovic) represents is the fear of 
naivete." He criticized Kovic's call for more U.S. support of changes in the 
Soviet Union and a "perestroika in America." 
</P>
<P>
"My hope for the future is a future without the communism that put Ron Kovic in 
a wheelchair," Dornan said. "He was shot by a bullet made in Russia, that's the 
irony of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan also said he was upset that Kovic planned to travel to Eastern Europe 
for showings of "Born on the Fourth of July." He said the movie "slanders the 
service Americans did in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"It says, 'Look at what bastards we were in Vietnam,' " he said. "The people 
there will look at it and say, 'Gee, we thought you were heroes.' " 
</P>
<P>
The movie, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Tom Cruise as Kovic, portrays 
Kovic's life as he grew up to become a gung-ho Marine who volunteered to serve 
in Vietnam and was paralyzed below the chest during a combat mission in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The movie follows Kovic's personal struggle when he returns from the war as a 
decorated and disabled veteran who then receives cruel treatment in a 
government hospital and is alienated from his family and former friends. 
</P>
<P>
Political strategists say they think a race between Kovic and Dornan would be 
close, volatile and highly visible. It's a race that has the potential to 
involve both sides of the leadership in Washington -- including President Bush 
-- as well as a parade of Hollywood celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"A Dornan-Kovic race would be a guaranteed E-ride," said Darry Sragow, a 
California Democratic political consultant. "You'd have a contest between two 
highly visible, highly articulate, strong-willed men with firm beliefs who 
could draw substantial resources from outside the district." 
</P>
<P>
Sragow said the movie would help Kovic, especially at first. But he also noted 
that Ohio Sen. John Glenn's 1984 presidential bid never got the political boost 
it expected from the release of the movie "The Right Stuff," which portrayed 
Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategist Stu Spencer, an Orange County consultant who worked on 
President Reagan's presidential campaigns, also said Kovic would be helped by 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's just the first blush," he said. "He starts way ahead in name 
identification over the mayor of Garden Grove or something; but after that, it 
comes down to who is a better fit with the philosophy of the district." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic heard some of the feelings he might face in a campaign on KABC Radio's 
Michael Jackson show Monday. He was praised by one Vietnam veteran and then 
criticized by another who said he didn't believe Kovic's war record and charged 
that it was actually a Hollywood fable. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who even wonder if I'm in a wheelchair," Kovic told the 
caller. "And I am, I woke up this morning and got in my wheelchair." Kovic 
invited the caller to lunch to show documention of his record. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it," the caller said. "I thought Mr. Kovic and the other 
sit-ins gave the Vietnam veterans an image they should not have."

Calling local merchants "the spirit of La Placita," Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode 
presented the Placentia Downtown Merchants Assn. with the fifth annual Golden 
Achievement Award for work in the Placita Santa Fe area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great advantage over other cities because we have (an) old town 
(area)," Eckenrode said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're going to make it even better." 
</P>
<P>
The award, given yearly to a group or person instrumental in helping the city 
achieve its redevelopment goals, was presented to Raul Davis, Dennis Blake and 
Ray Craite. 
</P>
<P>
"My family has lived in the area for over 120 years," said Davis, owner of 
T'quepaque Restaurant. "I'm proud to have a business there." 
</P>
<P>
The Placita Santa Fe area, one of the oldest in the city, is located south of 
Chapman Avenue and east of the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Although some local residents were reluctant to accept the idea of 
redevelopment on Main, Santa Fe and surrounding streets, the Downtown Merchants 
Assn. worked closely with residents to "really make things happen," said Joyce 
Rosenthal, director of development services. JULIE ESPY

CITY TO RECONSIDER DEPOT PARKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A missing parking meter and an outcry from angry commuters have prompted the 
City Council to postpone the county's first-ever daylong parking fee at a train 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-per-day fee, which was to have begun last Tuesday, met its first 
roadblock because a special meter had not been installed for 131 commuter 
spaces being leased by the Community Redevelopment Agency from the developer of 
a private, 352-space parking lot across from the Capistrano Depot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, protests by about 20 angry train commuters who spoke at a recent 
council meeting further delayed the fee, with the council agreeing to discuss 
the issue again during a meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But commuter and one-year San Juan Capistrano resident Jack Frost was doubtful 
that the commuter protest would eliminate the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it'll be tough to get the councilmen to change their minds," 
Frost said. "They are obviously all for the fee." 
</P>
<P>
The $2 spaces replace 99 free spaces in the depot lot that are being converted 
to a three-hour limit, to match the rest of the station's parking lot. About 40 
free parking spaces are being provided on a dirt lot at the corner of Yorba 
Street and El Camino Real, about one block from the station. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said the $2 parking fee helps defray costs of maintaining 
the multilevel parking facility and providing a 24-hour security guard in a 
joint public-private venture. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters argue that most train stations along the popular San Diego to Los 
Angeles Amtrak route allow free parking. Others have said that commuters are 
helping to reduce air pollution and freeway congestion, and believe that it is 
excessive to slap a parking charge on top of train ticket costs. 
</P>
<P>
The multilevel lot was built for the nearby Franciscan Plaza movie theaters and 
shopping center. WENDY PAULSON

MAYOR SEES 1990 AS GROWTH YEAR FOR CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Fred Hunter sees 1990 as a year of growth for the city -- from the 
projected start of construction on a planned sports arena to the completion of 
an expansion of the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest project ahead is the arena, which will have 20,000 to 22,000 seats 
and cost an estimated $85 million, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction should begin in February and be complete by the October, 1991, 
basketball season, Hunter predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The $40-million expansion of Anaheim Convention Center will bring the facility 
to 1.1 million square feet and make it the largest convention center west of 
the Mississippi River, Hunter said. Construction is expected to be complete in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Also in store for the city is a transformation of the downtown area into 
Anaheim Centre, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 10 years, the view from Hunter's downtown law office has been 
dirt lots on either side of City Hall. But construction in the redevelopment 
area is expected to bring businesses and housing back, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a town here many years ago, but they tore it down," Hunter 
said. "Downtown needs to be re-energized, to get going again." 
</P>
<P>
Construction should begin on the Pacific Bell-Koll project to the west of City 
Hall, Hunter said. The project will include 1.1 million square feet of office 
space, about 30,000 square feet in restaurants and a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Property project, about 400 housing units and retail space east of 
City Hall, is also expected to break ground, Hunter said. The development will 
feature shops with condominiums above them. And construction is in the works 
for Gypsum Canyon, the site at which the county has proposed building a jail. 
The City Council, which has gone to court seeking to block the jail project, 
will soon be considering the Irvine Co.'s proposal to build homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim Hills, ground-breaking is in store for two retail projects in 1990, 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
At Weir Canyon Road and the Riverside Freeway, a shopping center with 
high-volume, low-cost stores is planned. And on the other side of the freeway, 
at Weir Canyon and Santa Ana Canyon roads, an 85-acre regional shopping center 
with office space is planned, he said. SHANNON SANDS

INFANT CITY READY TO SET PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its first year of incorporation, this infant city's top priorities will be 
emergency services, traffic, infrastructure and land use, said Mayor Pat Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be setting up citizens' input groups, such as a traffic committee, a 
planning committee and an environmental review committee," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the first item to be sought from the new committees will be 
emergency services recommendations so that city needs are assessed before a 
contract for police services is settled with the County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The committees will also deal with traffic safety issues, as will the City 
Council, Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
"We may ask for a revision of designation of some streets," Bates said. "The 
idea of Golden Lantern becoming a super street has caused some concern. We want 
to make sure those street improvements will not have adverse impacts." 
</P>
<P>
Included in traffic issues is completion of several streets tied to agreements 
previously made between the county and developers, Bates said. Among those are 
Niguel Road and Alicia Parkway, especially the leg of Alicia Parkway behind the 
Chet Holifield Federal Building, also known as the Ziggurat. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an essential roadway for us and gets top priority," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
A new commercial center is part of the revised plan for the Ziggurat and will 
be a topic for 1990, particularly concerning potential environmental impacts, 
Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a major project for us and we'll give it very close scrutiny," Bates 
said. "Environmental review has always been a priority for us but now, instead 
of just making recommendations, we have the authority to set some standards." 
</P>
<P>
The council will immediately start looking at development and growth management 
issues as the city starts on the 30-month process of developing its general 
plan, Bates said. LEN HALL

HOLDUP SUSPECT HELD AFTER CHASE, CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth suspected of robbing a convenience store Monday was 
arrested after driving a stolen vehicle off a freeway embankment during a chase 
by police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, whose name was withheld because of his age, was treated for minor 
injuries and released to police custody. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Brian David Hall, 19, is in critical but stable condition at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital, Officer Richard McMillen said. Both suspects are from 
Corona, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a robbery call from the Circle K market on Stanton Avenue 
near Manchester Boulevard at about 4:15 a.m. today, McMillen said. The manager 
of the store said about $60 was taken. Witnesses said the robbers drove off in 
a white Ford. 
</P>
<P>
A vehicle matching that description entered the Riverside Freeway westbound 
from Beach Boulevard and was spotted by police shortly after the incident. The 
driver of the Ford refused to stop for police, and a chase reaching speeds of 
90 m.p.h. ensued, McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit lasted less than five minutes and ended with the Ford driving off 
an embankment near the 1700 block of Ardmore Avenue in the city of Bellflower, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was in Juvenile Hall after being booked for suspicion of robbery and 
possession of a stolen vehicle, and Hall will be booked for the same crimes 
when he is released by the hospital, police said.

COUNCIL TO REVIEW 2-YEAR LIMIT ON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider repealing an ordinance that limited 
Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie to a two-year term when she was elected in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 ordinance limited the candidate with the least number of votes in the 
November, 1988, general election to a two-year term in order to align City 
Council terms, City Clerk Mary Lou Morey said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms became staggered in 1984 when residents voted to directly elect the 
city's mayor every two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wound up electing three council seats and the office of mayor at one 
election and only one council seat and the mayor at the next," said Morey. "The 
ordinance allowed for things to be evened up." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, whose campaign cost $52,000 for a two-year term, received the fewest 
votes of the successful candidates in the 1988 election. If the ordinance is 
repealed, she will not have to run for reelection until November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, 34, said the ordinance may be unconstitutional and is considering 
challenging its legality. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had several people tell me that it may not be constitutional, but since 
it doesn't happen very often, no one has challenged it," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Richard Jones, who researched the legality of the ordinance, said: 
"There's enough of an argument there. There are some legal experts who say you 
can't limit the terms like that, and they would like to see that type of action 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
If the council does not repeal the ordinance, Gillespie would have to challenge 
it at her own expense. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made that decision yet," she said. GREG HERNANDEZ

$100,500 IN GRANTS TO GO TOWARD AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Community Foundation has announced that it will give more than 
$100,000 to four Orange County organizations addressing AIDS issues. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, with assets approaching $90 million, is the oldest grant-making 
foundation in Southern California and is now in its 75th year. 
</P>
<P>
The local organizations and their grants are: Orange County Center for Health 
($50,000); AIDS Response Program of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center of Orange County ($29,000); American Red Cross ($19,000), and AIDS 
Services Foundation of Orange County ($2,500). 
</P>
<P>
The foundation also announced grants totaling about $200,000 to similar 
organizations in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs we've chosen to fund, this year more than ever, reflect the 
diversity of those who are out there battling this epidemic," said Jack 
Shakely, president of the foundation. "It is very satisfying to be able to 
support such a breadth of innovative programs that are focused on those 
high-risk populations that too often fall through the cracks."

RIZZITELLO'S JURY SELECTION TO START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection is scheduled to begin today in the second trial connected to the 
1987 shooting of Mustang topless bar financier William Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Anthony Rizzitello, 62, who has a long history of racketeering and 
fraud convictions, is accused by prosecutors of shooting Carroll three times in 
the back of the head, leaving him permanently blind. Prosecutors claim 
Rizzitello wanted to take over control of the Mustang and decided he would have 
to eliminate Carroll first. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted of attempted murder last month in the Carroll shooting was Joseph 
Angelo Grosso, 48. Prosecutors claimed Grosso assisted Rizzitello by holding 
Carroll down when the shots were fired. Grosso testified that Rizzitello was 
the shooter, but denied any involvement himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 56, was found in a Costa Mesa parking garage on May 1, 1987. Two of 
the three bullets remain lodged in his head. For a year and a half Carroll 
refused to say who shot him, but eventually named Rizzitello and Grosso. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello's trial has been assigned to Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr., 
the same judge who presided over the Grosso trial. 
</P>
<P>
Separate trials were ordered for the two defendants when Rizzitello's lawyer, 
Anthony P. Brooklier, was tied up in a federal court case and Grosso would not 
agree to a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello was one of five men convicted in 1980 in Los Angeles' biggest 
racketeering case in which federal authorities claimed that it was the first 
time they had been able to bring down the entire hierarchy of an organized 
crime family. Rizzitello, considered by federal authorities a captain in the 
Milano crime family, was sentenced to four years in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello is being held in Orange County Jail without bail after authorities 
claimed at an earlier bail hearing that he would be a threat to eliminate 
either Grosso or Carroll before the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted in the Carroll shooting, Rizzitello would face an automatic 
sentence of 26 years to life in prison, the same sentence Grosso received.

CRITICALLY BURNED SUSPECT CHARGED WITH MURDERING FORMER GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County prosecutors filed murder charges Monday against a former Garden 
Grove man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend, but awaited word on his 
physical condition to see when or if he can appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Keith Framstead, 29, remained in critical condition at San Bernardino 
County Medical Center with third-degree burns over much of his body. He 
suffered the burns Saturday night when he doused himself with gasoline and set 
himself afire inside his car as police pursued him near Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
"We could arraign him right in the hospital room, but I'm not even sure he's 
coherent," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton, who is handling the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely at this point that he'll get a public defender and we'll just 
have to wait until his condition improves -- or worsens," Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Framstead, upset over the breakup of his stormy 
relationship with Tammy Marie Davis, shot the 19-year-old Stanton woman once in 
the head Friday night in Huntington Beach at point-blank range, just seconds 
after she screamed for help on a stranger's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Police say there are no known witnesses linking Framstead to the shotgun 
slaying. Middleton would not discuss the evidence that prosecutors have against 
the construction worker, who was last known to be living in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The murder came two days before Framstead was to report to Orange County Jail 
to begin serving a 6-month sentence for threatening Davis with a gun last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and family members, Framstead had repeatedly harassed the 
young woman since they separated in April, 1989. Previously, the pair had lived 
together in a Garden Grove mobile home with their baby girl, and often 
quarreled within earshot of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The situation became so volatile that Davis sought protection from the courts 
shortly after the breakup, Superior Court records in Santa Ana show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Surprised 
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten statement to the court, Davis said Framstead had threatened 
her with a gun on April 22, 1989, when she visited him to pick up their 
daughter, Briana, now 21 months old. She alleged that Framstead taped her mouth 
partially shut, pushed her and the baby to the ground, then threatened her with 
a cocked gun. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she "kept repeating to him that I loved him and never planned to 
stay seperated (sic) forever. . . . He kept repeating that he only believed in 
one family and that's all he wanted." She said she was finally allowed to leave 
and then called the police. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Framstead was later ordered not to bother or 
contact Davis or their daughter and to pay $250 a month in child support. A 
mediated agreement was later reached in which Framstead agreed to see a 
psychiatrist and was allowed to visit his daughter in the presence of a 
relative of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles psychiatrist Paul Purgard said in an interview that Framstead 
stopped treatment about three months ago, saying he was about to serve his jail 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not fighting the sentence, and that was that, I figured. I figured 
there's no big risk here, the man's in prison," Purgard said. "But he wasn't. 
So it was a total shock when I heard what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Commissioner Jane D. Myers presided over much of the 
Davis-Framstead case in family court and in an interview Monday recalled it as 
a "a very unpleasant situation." 
</P>
<P>
Myers said she believes the courts are often effective in helping calm domestic 
problems and did all they could in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"But when somebody is really intent on killing someone and is crazy enough to 
do it, there's really not much that a piece of paper is going to do," the 
commissioner said. "There's not much point in second-guessing. It's a terrible 
tragedy, but the only person responsible for what happened would seem to be Mr. 
Framstead."

SHERIFF TO ASK FOR FEDERAL FUNDING TO BATTLE DRUGS 
</P>

Noting that Orange County is a major transportation hub for narcotics 
traffickers, Sheriff Brad Gates said Monday that he will ask a top aide to 
federal drug czar William Bennett to enroll the county in a new program for the 
nation's worst drug-infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Gates will approach Judge Reginald Walton with the request today during an 
official visit by Walton to peruse county anti-drug programs for ideas that can 
be incorporated in a national strategy against drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has decided to declare certain regions of the country "high 
intensity drug trafficking areas," which will qualify them for increased 
federal assistance in the so-called war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Regions so designated will be disclosed at month's end when the President's 
budget is announced. Part, if not all, of Southern California is likely to be 
among the areas selected. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel factually that we fit into that mold," Gates said. "We have 
confiscated about 50 million doses of cocaine, 10 million injections of heroin 
and about $50 million in drug money (since formation of the Regional Narcotics 
Suppression Program in 1986). We feel the problem here is just as serious as in 
Los Angeles. We certainly would like to see some more help." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he would like a separate designation for Orange County if the county 
is not included in an overall designation for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, who is assistant director of the White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, will meet with the sheriff this morning for 45 minutes before 
attending discussions with county drug treatment professionals, the Board of 
Supervisors and educators at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, a Superior Court judge in Washington and Bennett's right-hand man, is 
said to be particularly interested in a host of alliances formed by county law 
enforcement, business, local government and UC Irvine to combat drug and 
alcohol addiction through education and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The programs include the Orange County Substance Abuse Prevention Partnership, 
which is a coalition of cities, the county and the university; the Alcohol and 
Drug Education and Prevention Team within the county's Health Care Agency, and 
the Drug Abuse Is Life Abuse program that involves local business and industry. 
</P>
<P>
County officials also hope Walton's fact-finding mission will boost their 
chances to get more federal funds and enlighten the judge about the 
shortcomings of current federal grants to county anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a two-way conversation," said 4th District Supervisor Don R. 
Roth, who will chair the discussion with the board. "It will be interesting to 
see what he has to say about available federal programs. We hope to get a real 
dialogue going." 
</P>
<P>
William Edelman, a division manager of the county's drug treatment efforts, 
said he is concerned that many federal grants last only a year, making it 
difficult to provide effective ongoing programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some consistency in federal funding, not one-shot deals where the 
money stops after one year," Edelman said. "The county can't always pick up the 
tab for programs when the federal money runs out." 
</P>
<P>
As assistant director for national drug control policy, Walton is the point man 
for Bennett's ongoing effort to develop and implement a national drug strategy. 
The policy is now in its second phase, which is designed to update and promote 
existing federal programs. Phase One involved assessing the drug problem and 
drafting the policy. 
</P>
<P>
During visits to 23 states and traveling 150,000 miles since September, Walton 
has fielded suggestions and criticism from hundreds of politicians, government 
officials and law enforcement representatives. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Walton met with local mayors in Los Angeles who reiterated their 
year-old request that Los Angeles County be designated a "high intensity drug 
trafficking area."

ROHRABACHER JOINS ROCK'S HAGAR IN BAJA HOLIDAY 
</P>

<P>
It's unlikely that many in the New Year's Eve crowd at Miguel's Cantina in Cabo 
San Lucas recognized the bearded reveler who shared margaritas that night with 
heavy-metal icon Sammy Hagar. But if they had, odds are that they would have 
been surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the only vacation I've had" in the last year, freshman Rep. 
Dana Rohrabacher said Monday of his five-day sojourn in Baja California with 
the lead singer of Van Halen, perhaps the premier heavy-metal rock band in 
America. "It really was great." 
</P>
<P>
An unabashed New Wave Republican, Rohrabacher, 42, made a name for himself 
during his first year in Congress as a champion of such button-down causes as 
Sen. Jesse Helms' attack on federal funding of what he calls indecent artwork 
and the preservation of special tax status for employee stock ownership plans. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another side to Rohrabacher, whose 42nd Congressional District 
includes northwestern Orange County. And he is not afraid to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sammy is a good guy, he's really terrific," Rohrabacher said. "Besides loving 
America and hating communists, what we really have in common is that we love 
tequila." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what Rohrabacher, Hagar and "a gang of us" enjoyed at Miguel's on New 
Year's Eve, albeit in cocktail form. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said: "They lock the doors at 11:30 . . . so nobody could come in 
-- or go out. You were there. Everybody had a really great time." 
</P>
<P>
Hagar, Rohrabacher said, has a been a good friend -- and a political 
contributor -- for several years. They met when Rohrabacher was working as a 
speech writer for former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine called me when I was at the White House," the congressman 
said, "and we were talking about the entertainment industry and how far left it 
was, and is. 
</P>
<P>
"And he said, 'Well, you know there are a couple of good guys like Sammy Hagar. 
. . . He's a rock 'n' roller who loves America and hates commies. . . . In 
fact, he had 20,000 kids at a rock concert chanting something obscene about the 
communists.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Really? This is the kind of guy I should meet.' " 
</P>
<P>
So the speech writer invited the California-based rock star to lunch at the 
White House. They talked music and politics, and a White House official who 
joined them for lunch persuaded Hagar to record several anti-drug messages, the 
congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's anti-drug," Rohrabacher said. "And I'll tell you, for a heavy-metal 
guitar player, that is very courageous." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Since that time, we've become pretty good friends." 
</P>
<P>
So Rohrabacher was not surprised when Hagar invited him to Cabo for the New 
Year's holiday. He ended up renting a condo near Hagar's. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, in fact, drove down from Los Angeles County in Hagar's 
just-repaired Ford Bronco, spending five days on Baja's tortuous roads. 
</P>
<P>
"As you might imagine, the car had a great stereo system," he said.

ROTH TO LEAD INSPECTION OF FAST EUROPEAN TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Don R. Roth has invited about 25 influential friends and 
associates to join him when he travels to Europe in March to inspect high-speed 
train technology, which could be used on a rail line between Anaheim and Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, vice-chairman of the California-Nevada Commission, which is planning the 
super-speed train, said that the panel will pay at least part of his expenses 
and those of other commissioners who make the trip, but that the other county 
travelers will pay their own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking along . . . top-notch Orange County citizens who will pay their 
own way," Roth said. "I think it's good to have people willing to spend $3,000 
of their own money to see what transportation is going to look like in the 21st 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who are set to go on the 10-day trip are Buck Johns, Doy Henley and 
John Cronin, all prominent members of the Lincoln Club, the Republican Party's 
club for major donors; Costa Mesa businessman Aram H. Keith; Anaheim Chamber of 
Commerce director Allan B. Hughes; Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, and 
consultant Frank Michelena. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Club President Gus Owen and Anaheim City Manager Bob Simpson also might 
go, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Henley, a Tustin resident, said he and his wife decided to go "to see the new 
wave of the future. Besides, I've got to go over there anyway on business." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the trip are being worked out by Jim Ort, an Anaheim travel agent. 
Ort said the group will probably fly to Bremen, West Germany, about March 12, 
where they will ride a prototype magnetic levitation system capable of 300 
m.p.h., built by TransRapid. 
</P>
<P>
Then the group will probably travel to Paris and ride French high-speed trains, 
which run between several French cities, Ort said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give the movers and shakers of the community an opportunity to feel 
the difference between an elevated magnetic levitation train and a 
steel-wheel-and-steel-tracks" train system, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get a good amount of movers' and shakers' support of this. . . . If 
we run into roadblocks later, we'll have people who are familiar with it." 
</P>
<P>
The commission last week mailed requests to several multinational consortiums 
for proposals to build the rail line for estimated cost of $5 billion to $7 
billion. The firms have until Jan. 24 to submit a $5,000 filing fee, along with 
a letter expressing interest in the project. Formal proposals, along with an 
additional $495,000 deposit, will be due in July, after which the 16-member 
commission will select a builder for the privately financed line.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: GANDARA IS THE TOP GUN AT UNIVERSITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Sorey, girls' basketball coach at University High School, knows the best 
way to handle his team's best shooter, Denise Gandara. 
</P>
<P>
He lets her shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"If my team's going to get beat, then I have to get beat with (Gandara) 
shooting the ball," Sorey said. 
</P>
<P>
And that hasn't been very often. University is 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gandara, The Times' Athlete of the Week, scored 27 points in University's 70-19 
victory over Irvine Wednesday, and scored 26 more in a 53-36 victory over 
Woodbridge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But before Gandara can shoot, her teammates have to get her the ball. 
University's offense revolves around that task. 
</P>
<P>
"This past summer, we had a girl transfer to our team and she didn't get the 
idea," Sorey said. "Finally I had to take her aside and say, 'Throw (Gandara) 
the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, it hasn't been easy. Not only did Sorey have to encourage Gandara's 
teammates to throw her the ball, he also had to tell her to shoot it. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of good shooters last year," Gandara said. "I look to shoot 
now because I'm the only starter returning from last year." 
</P>
<P>
Gandara was a reluctant shooter last season, but Sorey was confident she would 
take the initiative this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Denise would score this year, in part because she had a great summer," 
Sorey said. "In (assistant coach) Bruce Bernal, we have a great offensive 
coach. And he's encouraged Denise to shoot the last couple of years because she 
was a little reluctant. 
</P>
<P>
"She has the ability to shoot outside, put the ball on the floor and drive, and 
to post up. But I didn't dream she would be this successful." 
</P>
<P>
Gandara, a 5-foot-7 senior, does more than shoot, though. She is averaging nine 
rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good offensive rebounder," Sorey said. "She has good quickness, good 
leaping ability and good hands. Defensively, she screens out real well." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Allison Arrendondo of Los Alamitos scored 34 points, 20 in the second half, in 
a 50-47 loss to El Dorado Thursday. She had 19 of Los Alamitos' 29 points in a 
45-29 loss to Fountain Valley Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Senior post player Nicole Champion of Orange had 26 points, nine rebounds and 
five steals against El Modena Tuesday in a 69-52 victory. She scored 15 points 
and had 11 rebounds in 61-35 victory over Sonora Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Chrissy Coppage had three goals and had three assists to lead Esperanza's 
soccer team to a 9-0 victory over Loara Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Jalewalia had 34 points for La Quinta in a 76-16 victory over Pacifica 
Wednesday and had 35 points in a 62-60 overtime victory over Rancho Alamitos 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lunceford had five goals to lead Trabuco Hills' soccer team to a 9-0 
victory over Bolsa Grande Thursday.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: HIZON'S PLAY FINALLY TRUE TO NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistically, Vince Hizon appears to be enjoying a solid season for the 
Cypress College basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 14.6 points playing off guard and forward for the Chargers, the 
10th-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hizon struggled during the first half of the season. He was in and out 
of the starting lineup and was convinced he could do better. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing that great," Hizon said. "Frustration was starting to set in, 
then it was getting negative. I was happy the team was winning, but I wasn't 
satisfied with the way I was playing." 
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, Hizon started to think about what basketball meant to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided it was something I really wanted," he said. "It's a passion, 
and now I'm seeing how all the hard work has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Since Hizon, who is 6-foot-2, evaluated his situation, his numbers also have 
picked up. He has averaged 21 points during the last seven games, all as a 
starter. Hizon also has improved as a leader and was promoted to co-captain 
with sophomore guard Grayle Humphrey two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At times he tried to win the game single-handedly," Cypress Coach Don Johnson 
said. "But he's made so much progress. He's shown he's very stable and capable 
of playing within his game." 
</P>
<P>
Hizon plays inside as well as outside, and his statistics reflect his 
versatility. He is averaging four rebounds and 2.5 assists, and shooting 56% 
(96-170) from the field, 88% (64-73) from the line and 43% (22-51) from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Hizon came to Cypress (16-3 overall, 2-0 in the Orange Empire Conference) from 
Mater Dei High School, but not with the normal fanfare of other Monarch 
players. 
</P>
<P>
He played on Mater Dei's freshman team and moved up a level each year, finally 
making varsity as a senior. But he spent most of his senior season sitting and 
watching instead of playing. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Mater Dei, Hizon, who lives in Stanton, visited Cypress and knew 
he wanted to play there. It was at Cypress he would get a fresh start and a 
chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
He worked out all summer with Mater Dei teammate Char Ruppel, who is currently 
playing at Eastern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a schedule down," Hizon said. "We were lifting, running and playing all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Hizon averaged 12.9 points and 4.5 rebounds last season as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird to go from not playing in high school to starting in college," 
Hizon said. "I spent most of last year learning to play on this level. This 
season I'm learning how to win on this level." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford hero: Adam Keefe, a former Woodbridge High School standout, seems to 
get all of the attention as the local star at Stanford, but Kenny Ammann has 
quietly done an impressive job for the Cardinal as well. 
</P>
<P>
Ammann, a former All-Orange Empire Conference player from Rancho Santiago, 
scored the winning basket as the Cardinal defeated Oregon, 58-56, Sunday at 
Stanford. He hit an eight-foot baseline jumper as time expired. He also came up 
with the steal that gave Stanford the ball with 30 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Ammann, a 6-3 starting guard, is averaging 9.3 points and two rebounds. He 
graduated from Edison High School in 1986 and played at Cal State Bakersfield 
for the 1986-87 season. He then transferred to Rancho Santiago for the 1987-88 
season and was a redshirt at Stanford last season. 
</P>
<P>
Several county players have signed to play football next season, including 
seven from Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago linebacker Fred Soares, who has signed with Louisiana State, 
was the Mission Conference Central Division co-most valuable player on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Other Rancho Santiago players to sign were: defensive end Bobby Titus (Cal 
State Long Beach), wide receiver Royal Wilbon (Utah), quarterback Scott Wood 
(St. Mary's), wide receiver Paul Peters (Cal State Northridge), tight end Kyle 
Lynch (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) and defensive back Mark Maldonado (University 
of Dubuque). 
</P>
<P>
Tony Perry of Saddleback, a defensive lineman, will play at Cal State Long 
Beach, and teammate Mark Esposito, an offensive lineman, is going to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (18-1) fell to No. 2 in the state in the latest men's 
basketball poll. The Dons were the top-ranked team for a month until they lost, 
81-71, to Santa Monica. Imperial Valley (20-0) is the top-ranked team in the 
latest poll. Cypress (10th) and Orange Coast (17th) are the only other county 
teams ranked. . . . Golden West (21-1) is the top-ranked women's team. Orange 
Coast is ranked 12th and Fullerton is 15th. . . . Guard Grayle Humphrey's 
consecutive free-throw record at Cypress ended at 38 Wednesday. Humphrey, a 
sophomore from Sonora High School, made the first free throw but missed the 
second in a 101-69 victory over Saddleback.

CIPHER AGREES TO 'STANDSTILL' TALKS ON ARCHIVE OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an apparent softening of its resistance to an unsolicited tender offer made 
last month by Archive Corp., Cipher Data Products has agreed to negotiate terms 
of a confidentiality and "standstill" agreement with Archive, a possible 
prelude to talks concerning a friendly merger agreement between the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Confidentiality and standstill agreements are those by which companies agree to 
exchange non-public information on condition that the parties take no unfair 
advantage of the information, including buying the other's stock. Archive 
already owns a 4.6% stake in San Diego-based Cipher. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came three days after Cipher's board rejected as inadequate a 
$7.50-per-share, or $109-million, offer made Dec. 19 by Costa Mesa-based 
Archive. Also on Friday, Cipher said it had retained First Boston Corp. to 
explore "alternative transactions," including a merger with another company, to 
boost its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies are rival manufacturers of tape drives used to store backup 
copies of computer data stored on hard disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher also disclosed Friday that Archive had "indicated" on Jan. 4 that it 
might agree to sweeten its offer to $8 per share. Describing Archive's possible 
higher bid as "belated, informal and conditional," Cipher's board decided to 
respond only to the $7.50 offer, turning it down. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Cipher said it had told Archive on Sunday that it was "willing 
to entertain" Archive's $8-a-share offer. Any talks between the two firms will 
be contingent on the approval of the confidentiality and standstill agreements, 
Cipher said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a letter we sent to Cipher, we suggested that the companies meet on a 
friendly basis and negotiate something," said B.J. Rone, Archive's vice 
president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement Monday, Cipher said there was no assurance that the 
negotiations with Archive would lead to the confidentiality and standstill 
agreement, "nor as to what the outcome might be if any such agreement is or is 
not reached." 
</P>
<P>
Rone described Archive's $7.50-per-share offer as a "full and fair price," 
stressing that Archive was not officially raising its tender offer to $8 per 
share. Cipher Data executives did not return numerous telephone calls on Monday 
for comment on the tender offer, which expires Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculated Monday that Cipher Data's willingness to sit down with 
Archive so soon after asking First Boston to solicit other offers could mean 
that no better deals than Archive's are available. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it tells you there aren't a lot of offers on the table," said Russell 
Crabs, an analyst with SoundView Financial Group of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said Cipher's attractiveness to potential buyers was damaged by 
the company's disclosure Friday that it expects to report a loss of between $11 
million and $12.5 million, exclusive of certain expenses incurred as a result 
of the Archive offer, for the second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. Cipher 
reported a $14.2-million loss for its first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being caught up in a takeover battle, Cipher has filed suit against 
Archive, alleging patent infringement. In fact, some observers have said that 
Archive's takeover attempt could be a means of avoiding the financial impact of 
an unfavorable judgment in the patent suit.

DISNEYLAND, KNOTT'S RANKED 2ND, 4TH IN PARK ATTENDANCE FOR 1989 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
New rides kept the turnstiles spinning at the nation's most popular amusement 
parks in 1989 -- including Orange County's Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, 
which ranked second and fourth respectively in attendance last year. 
</P>
<P>
And Wild Rivers, the Laguna Hills water park, was ranked No. 6 among the 
country's water parks last year. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings are included in an annual survey in the current issue of Amusement 
Business, a Nashville, Tenn.-based trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that a record 254 million people visited U.S. amusement 
parks last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the areas that were hard-hit by rain and cool weather -- notably the 
Northeast and along the East Coast -- held their own" with park attendance up 6 
to 8%, said Tim O'Brien, managing editor at the publication. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees with Amusement Business's figures. The magazine's 
survey indicates that 14.4 million guests visited Disneyland, compared to about 
13 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources, however, said Disneyland's attendence was relatively flat in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
At best, attendance rose only a percentage point or two above 1988 and roughly 
the same as two years ago, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Park spokesman Bob Roth declined comment on Disneyland's attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Amusement Business attributes the rise in Disneyland's numbers to Splash 
Mountain, the multimillion-dollar flume ride that opened in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Blast to the Past '60s-themed promotion, which ran in early spring, also 
helped attract customers to Disneyland this year. 
</P>
<P>
While Disneyland has hung onto its No. 2 ranking for the past several years, 
attendance has been on a roller-coaster roll at nearby Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
After unveiling three minor thrill rides last year, the Buena Park amusement 
facility jumped from No. 6 to fourth place in the national rankings, with 5 
million patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The jump was partly due to a change in how the rankings are calculated. Pier 39 
in San Francisco -- an open entertainment area with few rides -- was dropped 
entirely from the rankings after placing third on the 1988 list. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new criterion, Pier 39 is no longer considered an amusement park, 
O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
That bumped Knott's up one notch. 
</P>
<P>
Then Sea World of Florida slipped from fourth to fifth place -- and below 
Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
The annual survey also ranked admission prices among the top 40 attractions. On 
that list, Disneyland's adult admission price of $25.50 is the second-highest 
in the nation. Knott's admission price of $19.95 ranks No. 13.

Disneyland remained No. 2 in attendance in 1989, as Knott's Berry Farm improved 
its ranking last year.

Direct Decline: McDonnell Douglas Computer System's effort to sell Pick systems 
directly to customers, rather than through resellers, was a key factor in 
bringing about the company's decline, according to Howarth. McDonnell Douglas 
has laid off 100 of the 450 workers at its Santa Ana computer unit, and the 
entire operation will probably be transferred to the United Kingdom next year. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas pioneered Pick through a computer subsidiary in the 1970s and 
remains one of the largest vendors of Pick products. But Howarth said the 
company made a key strategic error in trying to sell the system directly to 
customers and was unable to make the eventual transition to indirect sales 
effectively. Compiled by Jonathan Weber / Times staff writer

INVESTORS SWALLOWING UP SHARES OF BRITAIN'S PRIVATIZED WATER INDUSTRY

<P>
Like nomads at a desert oasis, investors here and abroad are gulping shares of 
Britain's newly privatized water industry, lifting prices to unexpected highs 
but raising fears of foreign control over a necessity of life. 
</P>
<P>
The government sold 10 water utilities in England and Wales for $8.4 billion 
earlier this month. It was the latest in a series of privatizations and 
surprisingly successful in an otherwise sluggish stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The government offered 2.183 million shares at the equivalent of $3.84 each. 
The shares, which began trading Dec. 12, quickly rose in price and by Friday 
were up about 50% on the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"They have done fairly well," said Stephen Doe, a water industry analyst at the 
London investment firm Smith New Court PLC. 
</P>
<P>
British investors weren't the only ones to perceive the water industry as an 
opportunity. Foreigners, including a French water company, also were aggressive 
buyers of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Within less than a week of the trading launch, the French group Lyonnaise des 
Eaux announced it acquired stakes in three water companies -- 9% in Anglian 
Water, 6% in Wessex Water and 2% of Severn Trent. 
</P>
<P>
France's two other big water companies, Generale des Eaux and Societe 
d'Amenagement Urbain et Rural, are also expected to be big buyers of the 
British shares. 
</P>
<P>
There's no immediate takeover threat to the big water utilities because the 
government retained "golden shares" limiting holdings in them to 15% for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
However, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley recently has expressed reservations 
about this limitation, suggesting it might be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The French water companies are keen to invest because they believe the British 
water companies are undervalued and offer good prospects for earnings growth, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The French companies have the expertise and technology to capitalize on the 
opportunities, which aren't available in other European countries where the 
water industries are mostly state-controlled. 
</P>
<P>
But some Britons oppose foreign control of their sources of water, particularly 
if the owners are French, a historic British rival. 
</P>
<P>
The resentment has been suggested in Britain's financial press, which has 
quoted critics of the water privatization as portraying the French water 
companies as raiding opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
But the Times of London wrote in an editorial: "While the government might have 
preferred to see British rather than French predators, it can hardly object 
when it is committed to a level playing field in the takeover game in Europe. 
We are all good Europeans now." 
</P>
<P>
The water shares are popular with other investors for other reasons. They are 
considered recession-proof because water is a vital commodity. Built-in price 
increases in the form of rate hikes virtually guarantee good profits for at 
least the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Hawkins, water industry analyst for Security Pacific-Hoare Govett Ltd., 
said the water shares' average yield is attractive at 7%, a 50% premium on the 
average market yield. 
</P>
<P>
The shares have been boosted by speculation about the French companies' buying 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
There had been concerns that the water sale would fail because it followed the 
sharp drop in world stock markets a few months ago. But demand for the shares 
greatly exceeded the supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We have proved our critics wrong," Environment Minister Michael Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
The water sale is the first privatization since the government's divestment of 
its one-third stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC, which was a failure because 
it coincided with the October, 1987, stock market crash. Many brokers suffered 
severe losses from the BP fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
The water privatization also faced stiff opposition from critics who believed 
such a vital utility should remain in state hands for reasons of security and 
water quality. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's critics said she was becoming too extreme 
during her third term, taking a privatization program too far. But she is 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to sell the country's electricity industry by 
mid-1992. That sale could raise more than $32 billion, dwarfing the other 
privatizations. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's Conservative government has sold $53 billion worth of state-owned 
companies in the past decade as part of a broader economic policy of 
encouraging private enterprise and investment by British citizens.

When Robert Conner looks at a stand of red oak, black cherry or maple rooted in 
the hills of Appalachia, he sees dollars for a chronically depressed economy 
and a way to ease the nation's trade imbalance, especially with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can increase the export of hardwoods, it will automatically provide jobs 
and make up for some of those cars the Japanese have been sending over here," 
said Conner, executive director of the Appalachian Export Center for Hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese like wood in just about everything. Once we figure out what they 
want and how to get it to them, we could be very big in the furniture and trim 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new export project was established last spring with a five-year federal 
grant of about $500,000 annually and a matching contribution from West Virginia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The center, housed in a converted dormitory, is a joint venture of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Service and the 
university's schools of agriculture and forestry, business and economics and 
extension service. 
</P>
<P>
The project's aim is to boost demand for Appalachian hardwood and products made 
from it, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Internationally, there's a shortage," said Conner, a retired marketing 
professor. "The demand is very strong. Most producers here are selling it as 
fast as they cut it." 
</P>
<P>
Towering stands of black walnut, poplar and other hardwoods are plentiful in 
the Appalachian region, which includes West Virginia and parts of Alabama, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main problems has been harvesting the timber and finding buyers, 
Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories are legion throughout Appalachia about people cutting valuable 
trees and then using the wood to prop up roofs in coal mines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have the systems in place to let the grower and the mill owner know 
who wants what, at what price and how to get it there," Conner declared. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is a leading exporter of finished hardwood lumber and among 
the world's top 10 producers of hardwood logs, according to Al Goetzl, vice 
president of economics for the National Forest Products Assn., a trade 
organization representing the solid wood industry. 
</P>
<P>
Exports of hardwood logs, lumber, veneers and other products totaled about $1 
billion last year, U.S. Forest Service figures show. Red and white oak 
accounted for about two-thirds of the sales, with ash, hickory, maple and other 
species making up the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest importer of American hardwoods, followed by Canada, West 
Germany, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Hardwood exports began to boom in the early 1980s, said William G. Luppold, an 
economist at the Forest Service's Forestry Sciences Laboratory in Princeton, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relatively new thing," Luppold said. "We weren't exporting a whole lot 
in the 1950s or 1960s. We began to ship to Europe in the 1970s when the 
exchange rates improved." 
</P>
<P>
Dynamic growth didn't come until the 1980s, when exports to Taiwan, an expanded 
European market and Japan made the United States a major player in the world 
hardwood market. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of U.S. hardwood lumber to Japan totaled $19 million in 1983, 
Department of Commerce figures show. That amount had grown to $132 million by 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though it will be the same or higher this year," Luppold said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Japanese have been interested largely in raw lumber, which 
their own craftsmen can process into finished products. One of the Appalachian 
center's goals is to increase exports of furniture and veneers to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting better," said Conner, who toured Japan last month with a group of 
furniture dealers seeking to break into the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
"The wage rate in Japan is so high that it doesn't pay to ship whole logs over 
there anymore," Conner said. "Now, they're beginning to order furniture parts 
that they'll assemble over there."

The Green Revolution spells big business for South Africa's platinum industry, 
as the metal is a key weapon in the fight against smog and acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa provides 80% of supplies to the Western world and will increase 
production of the metal, which is more valuable than gold, to meet rising 
demand in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Mining houses here are reluctant to detail their expansion plans, but some 
platinum analysts see output rising as much as 60% by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Several platinum producers said the higher output reflects rising demand from 
jewelers in Italy and especially in Japan, where the metal is preferred to gold 
as an ornament. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum is also used in petroleum refining, in the production of high-octane, 
lead-free gasoline and in airliner air purifiers. 
</P>
<P>
But producers say most of the sales growth will come from platinum's use in 
catalytic converters -- devices that reduce pollutants in automobile exhausts. 
The auto industry is the biggest user of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts worry about what they see as the metal's over-reliance on the 
cyclic auto industry, but the overall mood is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"There is strong demand and we expect that to prevail for the next few years," 
said Don Ireland, managing director of Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., South 
Africa's second-biggest producer. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to control auto-exhaust pollutants "is geographically spreading -- 
Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Australia. It's tending to spread worldwide," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of platinum has fluctuated between $420 and $620 an ounce in the past 
three years. But it is sold to industrial users on long-term contracts to 
protect them against sharp price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
New York metals dealer Ronald Tauber said at a platinum conference in 
Johannesburg in October that by the end of the century, the auto industry's use 
of platinum may double. 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians around the world now understand: They either will be actively 
promoting pollution restrictions, or they will be opposed by the majority of 
their electorates. . . . All of this is critical to the platinum market," 
Tauber said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumption by the car industry is expected to be reported at 9% higher for 
1989 than in the year before, with 43% of the supply going to the West, 
according to estimates published by London-based precious metals traders 
Johnson Matthey. 
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that demand for platinum from the European car industry 
surged more than 20% last year, spurred by European Community legislation to 
match U.S. laws to restrict small car emissions by 1993.

Mirkheim was here. Just like Kilroy. That seems to be the message, stripped 
bare, of Martin Mirkheim's life. Except that he has a loftier vision than 
Kilroy. Mirkheim would rather make a movie than carve his name in a tree. And 
not just any movie, but one about victory against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin is looking for something to distinguish himself, to leave his mark," 
Howard Korder said of the Panglossian anti-hero of his new play, "Search and 
Destroy," which is to receive its world premiere Friday at South Coast 
Repertory with Mark Harelik in the starring role. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were speaking Yiddish, I would call Martin a luftmensch," the 
32-year-old playwright added in a recent interview at the theater. "It means a 
man of the air, a man with his head in the clouds, a man for whom the 
practicalities of the world don't register." 
</P>
<P>
Korder himself gives the opposite impression. He seems a dreamer with his feet 
planted on the ground. Dark and thin, he is dressed in a brown turtleneck and 
black pants. He speaks carefully, despite an easy smile and quickness with a 
quip. Sometimes, apparently preferring to avoid even a suggestion of glibness, 
he rephrases his words because they flow too smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
American history is replete with entrepreneurs in pursuit of success, Korder 
said, "men who have dreamed the biggest dreams and realized them and left the 
messy parts to others." Mirkheim, who longs to join that fraternity, seeks 
entrance by trying to escape -- or, more accurately, to ignore -- his 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"He is," Korder said, "a man with an idea. This is his delusion. But he is no 
more delusional than Henry Ford." 
</P>
<P>
In "Search and Destroy," which is the Manhattan-born writer's 11th play and the 
winner of a $50,000 production grant from "AT&amp;T: OnStage," Korder traces 
Mirkheim's bid for glory with a sardonic flair already evident in his two 
best-known works, "Boys Life" and "Lip Service." 
</P>
<P>
"Boys Life," about a post-adolescent trio of desperate Lotharios, received a 
staged reading at SCR in 1985 and went on to a highly praised New York 
production at Lincoln Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse Theatre in 1988. Another 
production drew mixed notices last year at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Lip Service," a spare two-hander about a failing TV talk show, first appeared 
Off-Broadway at Manhattan Punchline in 1985. Korder, who once worked as a story 
editor on CBS's "Kate and Allie," adapted the play for an HBO Showcase in 1988 
under the producing aegis of David Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
This time Korder has chosen a much larger canvas. "Search and Destroy" 
stretches from coast to coast through airports, jail cells and bus terminals; 
from the condos of Boca Raton, Fla., to the corporate lair of a Dallas-based 
"human potential" guru; from Minneapolis to Miami and from New Jersey to the 
dubious sanctuary of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"This play deals with the myth of America as a land of infinite possibility," 
Korder said, "a place where earthly paradise can be obtained for each and every 
man and woman. It is a myth that claims we have infinite resources, infinite 
opportunities and an infinitely perfectible future. 
</P>
<P>
"Mirkheim believes the myth. He is a man whose head has been filled with the 
junk of our culture. He has grown up like a weed and flourished like a weed. 
His yearnings, I believe, are universal." 
</P>
<P>
"Search and Destroy" took root in Korder's mind after he read about a murder 
case that evoked some of the most unsavory emblems of the '80s: rapacious 
greed, cocaine hunger and celebrity power. The case involved the 1983 killing 
of Roy Radin, a New York theatrical producer who had come to Los Angeles to 
break into the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
Like Radin, whose demise became known as "The Cotton Club" murder because of 
its connection with the making of the 1984 movie, Mirkheim starts out as a 
promoter of circus-style acts, parlaying his way into the entertainment 
mainstream through drug deals and worse. Yet Mirkheim's fate differs 
significantly from Radin's. 
</P>
<P>
"The image of a man trying to burst his way into an arena of heavy hitters 
stuck with me," Korder said. "But it was just a starting point. I've written a 
different story about a different man. Mirkheim embodies an unfocused spiritual 
yearning, a bizarre mixture of evangelism and salesmanship. To me, he is the 
quintessential optimist. He has tremendous faith in his own abilities, a great 
belief that things will work out for the best." 
</P>
<P>
As for Korder's personal belief, one need only consider the title of the play, 
which summons up a phrase commonly heard during the Vietnam War. "I don't mean 
to conjure a specifically military operation," Korder said. "But I do intend to 
hint at a certain brutality in the order of things." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else he intended, Korder has clearly avoided writing a "living-room 
play." That style of drama, so different from the episodic adventures of 
"Search and Destroy," falls into a bourgeois genre that "has dominated the 
American theater for 60 years now," he said; and it leaves him cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a conscious decision when I started out as a writer," Korder said, 
"that I would not write a play where lights come up on a living room and people 
are sitting on a sofa, talking, and two hours later the lights come down. 
</P>
<P>
"Ibsen grafted social concerns to the living-room play, and it was radical in 
its time. It has been reduced, filtering down to us basically as an economic 
convention. It's cheap to do in terms of setting. But it's not what theater can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
For drama that excites him, he looks to such Jacobean playwrights as John 
Webster ("The White Devil," "The Duchess of Malfi") and Cyril Tourneur ("The 
Revenger's Tragedy") because of their social scope and their vigorous language. 
Chekov, despite his living-room habitat, also astonishes him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never write a play like Chekov," he said. "But he shows you the way 
people's lives fall apart in the space of a line. When it seems as if nothing 
is happening, a word is spoken and everything is changed."

Not surprisingly, Korder mentions his admiration for the work of Beckett, 
Pinter and Mamet as well. Mamet's influence on him has seemed so striking, in 
fact, that some critics pay Korder the backhanded compliment of describing his 
plays as "Mametesque," "Mametiana" and "Mamet-like." 
</P>
<P>
"There are worse people to be compared with," he said, unfazed. "It's better 
than being called Sidney Sheldon-like."

SOME ATHLETES BEMOAN LACK OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Andre Hayes is a business success. He owns a thriving car-detail operation in 
downtown Los Angeles, and says he will earn enough within a year to pay off 
two-year-old student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes also is a success in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
He flunked out of the University of Washington for a quarter but went back and 
earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He passed the Law Scholastic 
Aptitude Test last year and plans to enroll in law school. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes is one former Washington football player Coach Don James could point to 
as a model student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
If only he would cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
But with academics one of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s most 
pressing issues after decades of seemingly little concern, Hayes is not about 
to let educators -- or coaches -- off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Even with politicians and college presidents discussing ways to improve 
graduation rates and grade-point averages -- particularly in football and men's 
basketball -- Hayes is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like a student until I got done playing," said Hayes, who 
graduated in 1987. "Then I got to see what it was really like, just going to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said that despite recent talk of increasing graduation rates, the system 
leaves something to be desired. He said that as much as 80% of his time as a 
player was monopolized by practice, football meetings and watching game films. 
Hayes, 26, and other former players who attended major football schools in the 
1980s, offered insight into why athletes do not graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"You get some who have the wrong attitude about why they are there," said 
Hayes, who attended St. Bernard High in Playa del Rey. "They forget they are 
also students. Although a small percentage make the NFL, this is their main 
objective." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has returned to Los Angeles high schools to advise promising athletes. He 
says most youngsters are surprised to hear about low graduation rates and the 
even lower number of those who become pros. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters do not emphasize those points when trying to persuade an athlete to 
attend their school, Hayes said, adding, "I tell these kids, 'You've got to 
find out on your own before it's too late.' " 
</P>
<P>
For football players Martin French of USC and Jamelle Holieway of Oklahoma, the 
realization hit after season-ending injuries that probably also ruined their 
chances of playing professionally. 
</P>
<P>
French, who went to Fairfax High, was a defensive back when he broke an ankle 
in the 1985 Rose Bowl game against Ohio State. He wore a cast for six months 
and had three ankle operations. 
</P>
<P>
"That made me restructure my thinking, as far as I've got to have something to 
back myself up," said French, today the weekend sports producer for KTTV. 
</P>
<P>
"It never really hit until I was out and realized I might not play anymore, and 
I had to get something else going. A lot of people are not fortunate enough to 
get hurt like I did." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, who as an 18-year-old freshman quarterback in 1985 led the Sooners to 
a national championship, also was struck with the realization after suffering a 
knee injury late in his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a concern of mine to graduate," said the 1984 City Section player of 
the year at Wilmington Banning. "Especially after I was injured, lying in the 
hospital, I had a lot of time to think about it and to reconsider my options. I 
thought I was going to play pro ball." 
</P>
<P>
French, a communications major, and Holieway, who studied criminal justice, 
have yet to fulfill their academic requirements to earn their degrees, but they 
are close. 
</P>
<P>
French returned to USC last fall to complete one class as part of the Degree 
Assistance Program instituted four years ago. Seventy-six athletes have 
enrolled in the program, and 46 have graduated, said Mike McGee, USC's athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said he needs to take one test in a criminal law class to finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my mother that degree is her Christmas present," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, who played for a program now serving a three-year probation for 
recruiting violations, came close to graduating within four years. 
</P>
<P>
He said his mother's encouragement kept him going to classes, and earning 
credits at local community colleges during the summer. Although Oklahoma's 
football team has a less-than-envious academic record, Holieway has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"They did what they had to do; I did what I had to do," said Holieway, who 
recruits athletes for a Costa Mesa sports agent and is training to try out with 
an NFL team next year. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me an opportunity to get my degree and I'm doing that. They got 
their four years of football out of me. That's what a scholarship is. They give 
you free education, you give them athletics, and after that they can't ask no 
more or no less." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes disagrees. He maintains that educators are shirking their responsibility 
when dealing with certain athletes, particularly those from the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Washington) athletic department pushed players to take certain courses 
where there were friendly professors, but also to majors where the requirements 
weren't as strict," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled one prominent Husky, whom he would not name, who could not complete 
an application to rent a house when they were roommates. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering how this guy was getting through his classes," Hayes said. "No 
one ever sat down and talked to him: 'You need to do this or need to do that.' 
We needed more counseling . . . not just throwing him some classes just so he 
could be eligible for the following season." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said that Washington had professors who would allow academically 
ineligible football players to take correspondence courses as extra credit. 
Most schools offer correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see some of the papers these guys wrote and (what the professors) 
let them get away with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's overall graduation rate submitted to the NCAA last year was 48.2%. 
according to Tim Washburn, the director of admissions and records. For 
scholarship athletes in all sports it was 42.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Gertrude Peoples, director of student services for Washington athletes, said 
players were neither encouraged to take certain courses nor does the university 
have professors sympathetic to athletes' eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
She discourages athletes from taking correspondence courses because such 
courses are usually more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Courses don't crop out of the air where kids can do minimal work and get a 
grade," Peoples said. "There just aren't any. I'd rather have someone 
ineligible than to have them take a class like that." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cater to each athlete's needs, however, she said her counselors 
help athletes shape their academic future. 
</P>
<P>
"Every major is not realistic for everybody," Peoples said. "Not everyone can 
be a physics major. After two years, if a business major didn't work out, we 
would help them find something better suited to them." 
</P>
<P>
That happened to Hayes, who spent two years studying business but was unable to 
advance in the difficult school with a 2.7 GPA. He switched to the study of 
white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
Said Peoples: "In my tenure (18 years), coaches at Washington have encouraged 
kids to graduate. We've set up good tutorial programs. . . . I don't know what 
anyone else could do. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad if someone left thinking they got shortchanged. It is not a 
program that tries to take away from kids and give nothing back." 
</P>
<P>
Although administrators cite statistics purporting to show that many of the 
problems are being rectified, Hayes is doubtful. All he has to do is cite 
schools such as Oklahoma and North Carolina State, which still have abysmal 
graduation records and GPAs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame them so much for trying to lie or distort the truth," Hayes said 
of administrators. "I think, quite honestly, a lot of them believe they are 
doing the right thing. A lot of them believe that their system is working." 
</P>
<P>
He also had only praise for Peoples' work with Washington athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, when Hayes earned his degree two years after his eligibility had 
ended, he said only three Husky football players were in the graduating 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty ridiculous," he said. "This is what it has been reduced to? It 
actually boils down to being a meat market -- they get what they can out of you 
and they ship you out. 
</P>
<P>
"These administrators need to come down to the corner of South Central L.A. and 
see the background where they are getting these kids and realize if (the 
athletes) don't make it, look what they have to come back to. It's a one-shot 
deal for these kids. They have to succeed or they have to go back and deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Peoples said coaches and professors understand cultural problems attached to 
recruiting inner-city players. 
</P>
<P>
She said living in Seattle is an advantage to such athletes because they are 
given a chance to see another side of life. She said 70% of the scholarship 
athletes stay in Washington after finishing school. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, she said, several former Husky football players have returned to 
earn their degrees six years after the fact. Each is given one year's free 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Rogers enrolled for the winter quarter, which started on Wednesday. But 
he must await a Jan. 16 sentencing date for a conviction of negligent homicide 
in the deaths of three teen-agers stemming from a drunken-driving accident last 
year in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, his older brother Don, also a football star, died of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Rogers said returning to school offers a glimmer of hope after these 
tragedies. He is 33 units shy of earning a degree in psychology, and hopes to 
finish in two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to play a substantial amount in the NFL to save up a lot of money 
because the field (child psychology) I wanted to go in to doesn't make a lot of 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But injuries from the accident made it difficult to play professionally with 
the Detroit Lions and he was cut. So he returned to school sooner than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hayes, Rogers said that Washington took care of athletes' academic 
needs. He said a mandatory study hall after football practices forced the 
players to do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't make me do that, I would have gone right home and gone to bed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers tried to play football and basketball, but dropped basketball his junior 
season because of the rigors of being a student-athlete. He said he almost 
flunked out because of the two-sport demands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard going to class when you're an athlete," he said. "My energies 
were elsewhere. But basketball was too much. We would leave on a trip on 
Wednesday and return on Sunday. Some of the professors wouldn't let you make up 
the tests." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever he starts, Rogers will have a friend in class. Another former 
Washington player, tight end Rod Jones of the Seattle Seahawks, also returned 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he is one or two years away from earning a degree in society and 
justice. What did he do during the five years he played football? 
</P>
<P>
"School and sports is very difficult," he said. "I even went to summer school 
every summer. I don't think it matters when you graduate as long as you do it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Hayes would agree with that.

RAMS: A FUMBLE HERE, A COMPLETION THERE COULD HAVE ENDED L.A.'S DREAM.

<P>
This being the craziest Ram season in recent memory, how about a few 
wallet-size recaps of various thrills and spills along the road to next 
Sunday's NFC championship game against the 49ers in San Francisco? 
</P>
<P>
They're great stuff for parties. For instance, did you realize that had Patriot 
quarterback Steve Grogan completed one of those last-minute, end-zone pass 
attempts in New England, the Rams would have been eliminated from the playoffs? 
And there's much more. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the Rams played nine games this season that could be classified 
as stomach-turning, including three overtime contests. They were 6-3 in those 
games. Seven were decided in the last 16 seconds or less, five as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings that follow are based on a chewed-fingernail formula: 
</P>
<P>
FIVE NAILS 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 24 at New England, Rams 24, Patriots 20 -- We'll start here because of the 
playoff significance. The Rams clinched a wild-card spot but came thisclose to 
elimination: The Patriots had three shots at the end zone from the Rams' 
four-yard line with nine seconds remaining and couldn't score. What's more, 
Grogan missed a wide-open Eric Sievers in the back of the end zone on second 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Had Grogan connected, the Rams would have been knocked out of the playoffs on 
Christmas night by virtue of Minnesota's victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 26 at New Orleans, Rams 20, Saints, 17 (overtime) -- The Rams trailed, 
17-3, in the fourth quarter, then scored two touchdowns in the final 2:46 to 
send the game into overtime. Mike Lansford's 31-yard field goal won it. The 
play of the game was Kevin Greene's backfield tackle of tailback Dalton 
Hilliard in overtime, on third and one at the Ram 45. 
</P>
<P>
The player of the game was Flipper Anderson, who set the NFL's single-game 
reception record with 336 yards on 15 catches. Quarterback Jim Everett chipped 
in with 454 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 5 at Minnesota, Vikings 23, Rams 21 (overtime) -- Trailing, 18-7, the Rams 
scored two touchdowns in the final 7:20, Greg Bell's one-yard run with 28 
seconds left giving them a 21-18 lead. Then it was lights out. Wade Wilson 
threw a 43-yard desperation pass to Hassan Jones, and Rich Karlis kicked a 
40-yard field goal -- his seventh of the game -- with eight seconds left, tying 
it, 21-21. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Merriweather blocked Dale Hatcher's punt for a safety on the Rams' first 
possession in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 7 at New York, Rams 19, Giants 13 (overtime) -- Jackie Slater called 
heads, a field judge called pass interference, and Ernie Zampese called play 
"844" from the press box, all leading to a 30-yard scoring pass from Everett to 
Anderson 1:06 into overtime and a rematch with San Francisco at Candlestick 
Park. Other than that, not much action. 
</P>
<P>
FOUR NAILS 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 16 at Buffalo, Bills 23, Rams 20 -- The Rams thought they had stolen this 
one after Everett connected with Anderson on a 78-yard touchdown pass with 1:22 
left, putting the Rams ahead, 20-16. Then the legend of quarterback Frank Reich 
was born. Reich, subbing for injured starter Jim Kelly, drove his team 
downfield in the final minute and completed a game-winning, eight-yard 
touchdown pass to Andre Reed with 16 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1 at San Francisco, Rams 13, 49ers 12 -- The Rams took Round One at 
Candlestick Park on Mike Lansford's 26-yard field goal with two seconds left. 
Now, the rest of the story. . . . The 49ers were grinding out the clock for an 
apparent victory when, with 2:59 remaining, Ram nose tackle Alvin Wright 
punched the ball loose from fullback Tom Rathman's grasp at the Ram 19. Kevin 
Greene recovered and Everett drove the Rams 72 yards in nine plays to win. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 3 at Dallas, Rams 35, Cowboys 31 -- The Cowboys might have finished the 
season 2-14 had a referee not confused quarterback Troy Aikman's audible signal 
for a timeout on Dallas' final drive, which ended as time expired on the Ram 13 
with a completed pass to receiver Cornell Burbage. Burbage, it turned out, had 
run the wrong route, and Dallas didn't have a receiver in the end zone when the 
game ended. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams trailed, 31-21, in the fourth quarter before scoring twice in the 
final 3:58 on Everett passes of 39 yards to Ron Brown and 23 yards to Aaron 
Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 11 vs. San Francisco, 49ers 30, Rams 27 -- The Rams led, 27-10, in the 
fourth quarter at Anaheim Stadium when trouble started. Doug Smith's center 
snap stuck in the mud inside the 49er five-yard line with 6:41 left and the 
Rams leading by 10 points. Former Raider Matt Millen recovered at the five, 
where on first down, Joe Montana threw short to John Taylor, who ran 95 yards 
for a touchdown to cut the Rams' lead to four -- as Mike Cofer missed the extra 
point. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored the game-winn touchdown on a one-yard Roger Craig run with 
3:42 left. San Francisco scored 20 consecutive points in the final 10:04. 
</P>
<P>
TWO NAILS 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 24 vs. Green Bay, Rams 41, Packers 38 -- The Rams watched a 38-7 halftime 
lead evaporate as fast as Don Majkowski's passes whizzed through their 
secondary. Amazingly, Majkowski, who had cut the Rams' lead to seven, had the 
Packers on the one-yard line with 11:23 remaining when Brent Fullwood fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams managed only a field goal in the second half. It turned out to be the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they needed a heroic, 46-yard Greg Bell run in the final two minutes to 
run out the clock on the Packers, who had scored on five of their six 
possessions in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Bell finished the game with 221 yards rushing, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett threw to seven different receivers in the Rams' 19-13 
victory Sunday. . . . "We called the same play five times, and Jim sprayed the 
ball to five different receivers," said tight end Pete Holohan, who finished 
with five catches and 48 yards. "When we're rolling, we're good at spraying it 
around." . . . Add Holohan: He said the Rams' experience in close games this 
season gave his team the advantage in overtime. "We've been in like five or six 
of these all year," he said. "So, when we won the toss, we really felt like we 
were going to score." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he viewed Sunday's controversial pass interference call on the 
Giants' Sheldon White, Everett responded, "Pretty much on my back." Everett was 
knocked down on the play. . . . Tackle Irv Pankey, on how he slowed down 
All-Pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor in the second half: "The type of player he 
is, he pursues people all over the field, and he got a little worn down, 
especially because we had the ball for a while between the 20s."

JIM MURRAY: A NECESSITY FOR MAKING SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now but events over the weekend in pro football seem to give ringing 
endorsement to one of my long-cherished Murray's Laws of Athletic Probability. 
</P>
<P>
You all know what these laws are, if you've been paying attention: propositions 
as immutable as Pythagoras' Theorem. 
</P>
<P>
You may not ordinarily think of me as a man of science -- I have trouble 
opening a fuse box -- but when it comes to sports behavior I am infallible. I 
have decades of observable phenomena to verify me. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, who can quarrel with Murray's Law of geographic probability: 
"Whatever can go to New York, will?" That is as demonstrably true as the rule 
of geometry that sides opposite equal angles are equal. Even its corollary is 
true: "Whatever can go to Chicago, won't." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the tried and true Murray's Law that, "On any obvious passing 
situation late in an NFL game, the quarterback can help himself to 15 to 20 
yards anytime he wants." This happens so often, the point need not be 
belabored. 
</P>
<P>
But what has heartened me considerably over this past week is the prove-out of 
one of Murray's All-Time Pet Laws. It is this: "Quarterbacks get you to the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I admit it does not have the ring of basic theorems of history as, "The 
square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides," but it is, nonetheless, equally valid and provable. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the Super Bowl tournament. Every team in it has a prime quarterback on 
hand. As usual. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine what we have: Joe Montana? Well, of course. What more do you need 
to say? He comes with the Super Bowl. If he ain't in it, it ain't a Super Bowl. 
John Elway? Natch! Here's a guy who has put mediocre teams in Super Bowls. 
Elway is the most perfect proof of Murray's Law there is. Can you think of any 
other reason why Denver is always in a Super Bowl -- or right next to it? 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar. Look! This may be the really smartest quarterback in the game. He 
unloads the ball in a kind of ungainly sidearm motion like a guy dropping a 
suitcase, but let me tell you something, Stan Musial didn't have the best 
batting form you ever saw. Neither did Ty Cobb. Kosar's passes look just fine 
on a scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett? Well, he's a relative newcomer, some would say untried. But let me 
put it this way -- is there another quarterback besides the ones we've already 
mentioned who's any better? Dan Marino? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Super Bowl is, you go there, so to speak, on the arm. 
Certainly, not the hoof. 
</P>
<P>
Check the records: The only possibly unqualified QB in the long history of the 
Super Bowl might be Miami's David Woodley in 1983. No one ever mixed David up 
with Sammy Baugh. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest, there was almost always a legend or semi-legend in the irons. 
Fran Tarkenton used to get his team in the Super Bowl. Joe Namath did it. Bart 
Starr did it. Lenny Dawson. Roger Staubach. Otto Graham would have. 
</P>
<P>
It's the one constant in a Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
None of this appears to rub off on general managers. Given the presence of 
all-hype running backs in the spring draft, they fall all over themselves to 
pick up 1,000-yard runners, Heisman winners, speed freaks. They usually pass up 
quarterbacks. "Not a good year for QB's," they usually sniff. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Have you noticed Eric Dickerson isn't even in the Super Bowl hunt? Never 
is. Neither is Herschel Walker. Minnesota gave up everything short of the state 
capitol to get him. It didn't help. They didn't get to the Super Bowl finals 
because Wade Wilson is not as good as the quarterbacks who did. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be fair to say running backs don't matter. It's just that they're 
not critical. They're nice to have, but you don't need them. You don't need a 
Galloping Ghost. A competent experienced 4.6-speed runner will do if the game 
plan is artful enough. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson isn't in a Super Bowl. Earl Campbell never made one -- and if Earl 
Campbell can't put you in a Super Bowl, no running back can. 
</P>
<P>
The old Dallas Cowboys used to have Calvin Hill and Duane Thomas, but the Super 
Bowls came with Roger Staubach. Franco Harris ran nice with the football, but 
Terry Bradshaw and Lynn Swann won four Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
O.J. Simpson never made a Super Bowl. Barry Sanders, as great a year as he had, 
isn't in a Super Bowl or even a playoff. Walter Payton got in a Super Bowl in 
his dotage. And a quarterback, Jim McMahon, put the team there, not Walter. 
</P>
<P>
There have been Super Bowls -- 1985, San Francisco-Miami, and 1988, 
Washington-Denver, come to mind -- where everybody in the country knew the 
quarterbacks but hardly anyone could name the starting (or backup) running 
backs. Come to think of it, who were the running backs last year? 
</P>
<P>
If running got you to the Super Bowl, the Giants would have gotten by the Rams 
Sunday. Deacon Jones, when he was the definitive defensive end for the Rams, 
always used to tell me: "We don't worry about the run -- we'll never get beat 
by the run." 
</P>
<P>
I rest my case. I would remind you Joe Montana wasn't selected until the third 
round of the 1979 draft. Johnny Unitas was working on a steamshovel when he was 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
I don't expect any of this to have any influence on front offices. They have a 
long history of resisting my well-intentioned advice. But can I tell you 
something? The Seattle Seahawks have never drafted a quarterback No. 1. That 
may tell you all you have to know about the Seattle Seahawks. The Buffalo Bills 
drafted only one quarterback No. 1 in their history. Their first year, they 
drafted Richie Lucas out of Penn State. The New Orleans Saints drafted only one 
quarterback No. 1 in their existence, Archie Manning of Ole Miss. Dave Wilson 
was a supplemental No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to go to Carnegie Hall, practice. If you want to go to the Super 
Bowl, turn right at the quarterback. That's Murray's Fourth Law of Football. 
And I didn't need an apple to fall on my head.

Horace C. Stoneham, who shocked New York when he moved the Giants to San 
Francisco, died Sunday in a nursing home in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
Stoneham spent the last 13 years in retirement near the Giants' spring training 
complex. He sold the club in 1976 after having served as its principal owner 
and president for 40 years. Under Stoneham's ownership in New York, the Giants 
won four National League pennants and the 1954 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said, "He was very much at home watching the game 
of baseball. My deepest sympathy to Mrs. Stoneham and his family." 
</P>
<P>
The funeral will be held Wednesday in Scottsdale.

LASORDA SETS UP COMPETITION AT THIRD; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: JEFF HAMILTON IS THE INCUMBENT, BUT NEWCOMER HUBIE BROOKS WILL GET A 
LOOK IN SPRING TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WIRTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda couldn't resist topping Monday's newcomer luncheon 
with something even tastier than the Swiss almond ice cream -- a third base 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that new Dodger outfielder Hubie Brooks would take ground balls at 
third base this spring, promising that, "When the season opens, I'm going to 
play our best eight guys, and right now I don't know who they are going to be." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody gently nudged Lasorda and asked, uh, what about current third baseman 
Jeff Hamilton? 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way -- he's the incumbent," Lasorda said. "That doesn't mean he's 
going to be the guy. That doesn't mean anything but that he's the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Reached in his suburban Phoenix home, Hamilton sighed, having been rudely 
roused out of his winter calm. 
</P>
<P>
"When they got Brooks, I didn't think anything about this," Hamilton said. "In 
this game you never know -- obviously. We finished in fourth place, and I guess 
this is what happens when you finish in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well. It's not like I'm not used to it." 
</P>
<P>
About the only person more confused by the announcement was Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, I'm the right fielder, and I'm looking forward to being the 
right fielder," said Brooks, who attended Monday's luncheon with other 
newcomers Jim Gott, Juan Samuel and Mike Maddux. "It's not like playing third 
base would be debilitating or anything. But it would mean a different 
mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention a different glove, one which Brooks hasn't regularly used since 
1984, when he completed a five-year run as the New York Mets' third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers signed free agent Brooks from Montreal on Dec. 21, it was 
assumed he would at least begin the season in right field, leaving Kirk Gibson 
to play left field and moving Kal Daniels to the bench or off the team if both 
Gibson and Daniels are fit. But Lasorda emphatically put that in doubt when 
asked if Brooks would work at third base this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet on that," he said. "He will take grounders, fly balls, line drives 
. . . we've got to find a place for this guy to play. A guy who drives in runs 
like he does, he will have a place to play." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hamilton established several career highs at the plate last season, he 
still had only a .245 batting average with 12 homers and 56 RBIs. Brooks has 
bettered those numbers in each of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton has also failed to thrill the Dodgers with his play in the field. 
Among six National League third baseman who played in at least 140 games last 
year, his .951 fielding percentage was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at 25, Hamilton has played in just two full major league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't like I'm on the way out, I'm on the way up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lasorda sent notice that this season's virtues will not include patience. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve our offense and we will improve our offense," he said. "No 
matter what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
This is nothing, obviously, that another Dodger trade couldn't cure. The 
Dodgers have spoken with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who would like Hamilton and 
would be willing to trade outfielder Barry Bonds. But the Pirates are also 
requiring Tim Belcher, whom Dodger Vice President Fred Claire will not deal. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential spring controversy was temporarily quieted when Lasorda said 
that center fielder Juan Samuel had convinced him that he wants to play center 
field, despite Samuel's earlier comments that he wanted to return to second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"We ate dinner in the Dominican Republic together, and he seemed excited about 
playing center field for us," Lasorda said. "They say he's not a good center 
fielder. Well, maybe he wasn't a good center fielder with the Mets. But with 
us, it will be different." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel seemed more resigned to his task than in earlier conversations after his 
Dec. 20 trade from the New York Mets for pitcher Alejandro Pena and outfielder 
Mike Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I play more second base than outfield, as it stands, I am the 
Dodger center fielder," he said. "We will work hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Top third base prospect Dave Hansen was named most valuable player in the 
Dominican Republic Winter League. Hansen, who is expected to begin this season 
at triple-A Albuquerque, hit .327 in 188 at-bats with three homers and 21 RBIs. 
. . . In the Venezuelan Winter League, top catching prospect Carlos Hernandez 
hit .280 with 21 RBI. He also is expected start the season at Albuquerque. . . 
. In the Puerto Rican League, Dodger utility man Lenny Harris hit .337 in 24 
games while learning to play the outfield. Right-handed reliever Mike Hartley, 
who could compete for a spot in the Dodger bullpen, had 10 saves in 25 games 
with a 3.46 ERA.

Abe Lemons, whose quick wit and flamboyant nature have endured through almost 
35 years of coaching college basketball, says he will retire when his contract 
at Oklahoma City University expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
Lemons, who has a coaching record of 586-335, said he knew it was time to 
retire, "when I saw my team play." 
</P>
<P>
Lemons began his coaching career with Oklahoma City in 1955 and stayed there 
for 18 years, taking the Chiefs to the NCAA tournament six times and to the 
National Invitation Tournament twice. He then coached three years at Pan 
American and six years at Texas before returning to Oklahoma City in 1983.

NEWSWIRE: BO SCHEMBECHLER SWITCHES SPORTS, JOINS TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confirming earlier reports, Bo Schembechler switched sports Monday and was 
named president and chief operating officer of the Detroit Tigers. Schembechler 
retired as football coach of the University of Michigan after the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Football and baseball, it's all competition," said Schembechler, who will be 
responsible for the daily operations of the club. "It can't be too much 
different from what I was doing at Michigan. I'm a reasonably intelligent guy." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, 60, who ended a 27-year football career last week as the 
fifth-winningest Division I-A coach in history with a 234-65-8 record, replaced 
Jim Campbell, who moved up to chairman of the board. John E. Fetzer, the former 
board chairman, was named chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
To take the Detroit job, Schembechler took a leave of absence as athletic 
director at Michigan, a post he held in addition to his coaching job. Jack 
Weidenbach, senior associate athletic director, was named interim athletic 
director.

TUCKER KNOCKS OUT JONES IN FORUM FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Tucker, the world's second best heavyweight as recently as three summers 
ago, flattened surprisingly tough journeyman Calvin Jones in the fifth round at 
the Forum Monday night to raise his comeback record to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the 6-5, 242 1/2-pound fighter said he was ready for anyone as soon 
as today, presumably including Mike Tyson, who needed to go the distance in the 
summer of 1987 to take Tucker's International Boxing Federation championship 
and unify the heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
Against Jones, a capable and moderately dangerous heavyweight, Tucker was 
sharp, in good condition, under control, executing with precision and fighting 
with confidence. He may have been away for 2 1/2 years, but he easily looked 
like a top 10 heavyweight Monday night before 5,566. The 31-year-old former 
champion, 36-1 with 31 knockouts, dropped out of sight after his decision loss 
to Tyson, tumbling into a morass of "personal problems." 
</P>
<P>
In Jones, Tucker was confronted by a 6-6, 243 1/2-pounder who appeared at times 
to be trying to steal the fight with a fake foul. He went down three times, in 
rounds two, three and four, each time claiming low blows that most ringsiders 
saw as legal blows, or marginal punches on the belt line and certainly not as 
low as Jones (14-4) was claiming. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, brought in from Bristol, Tenn., was outclassed but dangerous throughout. 
And his was an odd performance. When he wasn't seemingly trying to win on a 
foul claim, he was catching Tucker with looping right hands to the head. Tucker 
was never rocked by any of Jones' punches, but they certainly got his 
attention. Tucker, smooth and gliding about the ring flatfooted, landed 
murderous hooks to Jones' ribs and long and short right hands to the head. He 
put Jones on his back with a straight right two minutes into round one. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones came out throwing bombs in the second and won the first minute with a 
couple of long rights. Midway through the round, Jones went down for the first 
time, crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Dr. James Jen Kin didn't buy the first low blow claim but did give 
Jones about two minutes to recover when he went down in the third in the same 
fashion. He also took a point away from Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
When Jones went down similarly in the fourth, Jen-Kin began a count and when 
Jones arose he ordered him to fight. 
</P>
<P>
The end came at 2:09 of the fifth, when a short, jolting Tucker right inside 
caught Jones on the chin. He crumpled onto his back and Jen-Kin waved off 
Tucker without starting a count. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with what I did," said Tucker, who trains at Big Oaks Lodge in 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was awkward, big and strong, and I needed the work. I learned from 
this one -- in boxing, you can never learn enough." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's promoter, Ed Bell, is mapping a route to a fight with Michael Dokes, 
ranked in the top 10 by all three governing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
In the co-main event, Edward Parker (20-3-2), who earned $100,000 by winning 
the Forum's super-featherweight tournament in October, scored a unanimous 
decision over Abe Gomez (15-4-1). In another heavyweight bout, Alex Garcia 
(14-1) stopped Andre McCall (14-5-2) in the second round.

<P>
News item: NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz calls for sweeping changes. 
Reaction: OK, for a sweeping change, how about passing legislation that truly 
benefits the student-athletes? . . . 
</P>
<P>
For instance, let them share some of the revenue the schools collect from their 
huge basketball tournament and bowl-game television contracts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams actually had a 2-1 edge over San Francisco in 1989. They won an 
exhibition game in Tokyo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Every time I watch a coin toss before overtime, I'm reminded of Abner Haynes' 
goof in the 1962 AFL championship game. Haynes, the Dallas Texans' captain, won 
the toss but mistakenly chose to defend a goal, and his team wound up kicking 
into the wind against the Houston Oilers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Haynes, the Texans won, 20-17, in a second overtime period. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
The pros should follow college football's lead and make pass interference a 
15-yard penalty instead of spot-of-the-foul. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the Three Amigos? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard will do a fine job as general manager of the San Diego Chargers 
if owner Alex Spanos allows him to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that the majority of NCAA I-A football coaches don't want a 
national championship tournament. A win in a bowl game satisfies the alumni a 
lot more than a loss in a playoff game would. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler's switch from football to baseball isn't unique. Among others, 
Jim Finks was president of the Chicago Cubs, and Stu Holcomb was general 
manager of the Chicago White Sox. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Curry, who had enough of the pressure, decided to leave Alabama long 
before the Sugar Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith plans to meet with linebacker Junior Seau and safety Mark 
Carrier this week. Both have a year of eligibility remaining but could opt for 
the NFL draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on Prime Ticket's "It's Your Call," Darryl Strawberry again sounded 
as though he wants to play for the Dodgers when he becomes a free agent after 
this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's not always like father, like son. Jack Nicklaus Jr. was among those who 
missed the cut at the qualifying school for the Ben Hogan Tour. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How meaningful are college basketball polls? The last wire-service national 
champion to win the NCAA tournament was North Carolina in 1982. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We'll know a lot more about UCLA after its Saturday afternoon game against 
Arizona at Pauley Pavilion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for Colorado State, where Boyd Grant is doing the same kind of 
coaching job he did at Fresno State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Raveling could get the first home sellout of his USC career Saturday 
afternoon. The game against Arizona State will be played in 2,200-seat Lyon 
Center on campus. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It is to the credit of Jerry West that the Lakers, who have drafted low for 
many years, are one of the deepest teams in the NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The old Clippers would have folded if they trailed the Knicks, 22-9, in the 
first quarter at Madison Square Garden. But Don Casey's kids fought back 
Sunday, took New York into overtime and lost only after what looked like a 
goaltending violation by Patrick Ewing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg's legacy will be, "Oh, my!" . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm won the Eclipse Award for 2-year-olds because he beat Grand Canyon in 
their only head-to-head meeting, but this wasn't really comparable to the 
Miami-Notre Dame situation because Grand Canyon accomplished a lot more the 
rest of the year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dan Kenny, part-owner of Sunny Blossom, the Santa Anita six-furlong 
record-holder, disputes our claim that an extremely fast track was responsible 
for his colt's 1:07 1/5 time and points out that he ran a 1:07 2/5 last year en 
route to a 6 1/2-furlong victory. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFOX radio sports-talk host Bud Furillo suggested to George Allen on Thursday 
that he hire Pro Football Hall of Famer Willie Brown as an assistant coach at 
Cal State Long Beach. Allen did on Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Furillo's next suggestion for a spot on Allen's staff is former Banning High 
coach Chris Ferragamo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On ESPN's "Sports Reporters" Sunday, Howard Cosell showed that he hasn't 
changed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Angels still may be a trade away from serious contention in baseball's 
toughest division, the American League West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New Dodger relief pitcher Jim Gott said club publicist Mike Williams, a 
teammate on San Marino High's championship team of 1977, is the best shortstop 
he has ever played with. Jim was either joking or forgetting about his former 
Toronto teammate, Tony Fernandez. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maury Wills, the base stealer who merely revolutionized the game of baseball, 
again will be slighted when the Hall of Fame balloting is announced tonight.

BULLETS' WILLIAMS FACES TOUGH REHABILITATION 
</P>

John Williams twice has watched the tape of the Washington Bullets' game with 
the Utah Jazz at the Capital Centre Dec. 2. When it reaches the point where his 
right knee pops and he crumples to the floor in pain, it is still almost 
impossible for the Bullets power forward to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a freak accident," said Williams, who was viewed as the 
cornerstone of the Bullets' rebuilding plans, "but it has put my whole life on 
hold." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of Saturday's 102-88 loss to the Boston Celtics, Williams 
talked to the media for the first time since the injury that required surgery 
to repair his medial collateral ligament and will keep him sidelined until at 
least late February. 
</P>
<P>
The mental anguish of watching his team dropping out of playoff contention has 
been almost as tough to take as the physical pain as he begins his 
rehabilitation work, he said. Williams has seen the Bullets (13-19) play only 
twice at home. 
</P>
<P>
"They need my support, but it just gets very frustrating watching them lose and 
knowing I can't help," he said. "Even when I'm watching on television, it's too 
painful to watch a whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' immediate problem, though, is dealing with the uncertainty of whether 
he will be able to resume his promising basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury was like a hard slap in my face," he said. "I've never been 
seriously hurt before -- high school, college or pro. But I knew I had done 
something bad to the knee as soon as I went down. We had a big crowd that 
night, and I could still hear a tearing sound over the crowd noise." 
</P>
<P>
Surgery only heightened his fears. 
</P>
<P>
"I know great players like (the Bullets') Bernard King and (the Los Angeles 
Clippers') Danny Manning have come back from surgery and played well," Williams 
said. "It sounds good, but you have to go through a lot of pain to make it 
back. I've talked to Bernard about it several times, and he told me it will 
require a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
King's injury, when he was a member of the New York Knicks in 1985, was 
considered more severe. He missed 185 games after surgery that almost totally 
reconstructed his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Most National Basketball Association teams, including the Knicks, believed he 
never again would be a first-line player, but King, 33, a fierce competitor and 
self-motivator, averaged 20.7 points for the Bullets last season and, after a 
slow start this year, has boosted his average to 19.1.

<P>
IN CHARLOTTE, REALITY HAS SET IN -- HORNET FANS NOW WANT WINS 
</P>

CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The honeymoon would appear to be over. 
</P>
<P>
They still sell out every game at the Charlotte Coliseum, where the Hornets 
drew the second-most fans in NBA history last season, and long ago proved that 
concerns of this being strictly college basketball country were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second season, people now want wins, not just the novelty of the NBA 
in their city. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the fans have gotten sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was fantastic," Carl Scheer, the Hornets' president and general 
manager, said Monday. "They were so for anything we did. They cheered 
out-of-bounds plays. But it was so unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
Right. Kelly Tripucka, one of the most popular Hornets a year ago but in a 
shooting slump now, recently went to the grocery store and got booed by a fan. 
Tripucka has been hearing that, multiplied, at games. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody feels worse about it than us," Tripucka said. "All of the boo birds and 
knuckleheads go home feeling disappointed about the way we played, but they 
won't feel anymore disappointed than us." 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, who will play host to the Clippers tonight, come into the game 
with seven wins and in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Last season at this 
point, they had nine victories, a minor difference that couldn't account for 
any cooling trend by the paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's that the novelty has warn off," Scheer said. "Our fans 
are every bit as passionate as before." 
</P>
<P>
But something is different. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more critical," he said. "The expectations are much higher because 
they got a dose of success last season. Maybe I'd like them to be a little more 
patient, and the players and coaches would, too. But nothing has surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
Has the change surprised players, though? 
</P>
<P>
"It may have," Scheer said. "Kelly certainly. I think it took him back. But his 
ego is really on the fringe." 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets gave up Mike Brown, acquired in the expansion draft, to get 
Tripucka from the Utah Jazz, and he responded by averaging 22.6 points, second 
best in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The boos he has been hearing this season serve as the most dramatic indication 
of the changing climate. Tripucka had been hearing scattered boos for a while 
when he was benched for the first time in his Charlotte career Dec. 28. But 
after getting a season-high 25 points, including 14 of the Hornets' 18 points 
in the fourth quarter of that game against Cleveland, it was cheers. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked to come to center court for a postgame radio show that is also 
broadcast in the arena on the public-address system, and at first refused. 
Tripucka finally consented, then broke down from the frustration, and cried on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been very difficult for me," he said, choking out the words during 
the broadcast. "You people have a right to boo us, but don't ever accuse us 
players, or myself, of not trying to bust our butts. Some nights we deserve to 
be booed, but this is going to take time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here last year, I thought it was the greatest thing that ever 
happened to me. I wanted to end my career here. Now, I have to go home and 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Tripucka then got up and left the court. 
</P>
<P>
Take that, you knuckleheads. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Ray Patterson has given his vote of confidence, but rumors 
persist that Houston's Don Chaney will be the next coach fired, with Tom 
Nissalke, a former coach and now a television analyst for the Rockets, coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've been going through is not a reflection on Don," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Rockets have labored with a backcourt firing blanks, which allows 
defenses to pack in on center Akeem Olajuwon. Mitchell Wiggins, who is expected 
to miss another two weeks with a sprained knee ligament, is the only guard 
shooting better than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Something has to give, though. Should any team with Olajuwon have gone 3-12 in 
December, the second-worst record for the month, behind only the 2-13 by 
expansion Orlando? 
</P>
<P>
The New York Knicks will retire Dick Barnett's jersey, No. 12, during 
ceremonies March 10. He is the last member of the 1969-70 championship team to 
be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beginning to wonder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most-ly recovered: Announcer Johnny Most, who is to the Celtics what Chick 
Hearn is to the Lakers, made his first appearance of the season on Wednesday 
after triple-bypass surgery and was greeted by a standing ovation at Boston 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald said that Most sounded weak, but had "a touch of that 
old-time fire at the enemy" that has helped make the 38-year, gravel-voiced 
broadcaster famous. 
</P>
<P>
Just a touch? 
</P>
<P>
Most said that Washington's Ledell Eackles threw "his first pass since last 
December" and that Mel Turpin of the Bullets looked "like a big tub of lard" 
and "committed about 14 personal fouls, but they only called four." 
</P>
<P>
That about answered any questions as to whether heart surgery would change his 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," he said. "I'm like a kid with a new toy. When I walked in here 
tonight, I thought the Garden is the most beautiful building in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind the heart. Better check those eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise selection of Dick Motta as Sacramento coach rekindled an old 
story, back from when he was at Dallas and a reporter accused him of hating 
every Maverick except Brad Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you talking about?" Motta shot back. "I don't like Brad Davis." 
</P>
<P>
John MacLeod, himself a former Dallas coach, was the front-runner for the King 
job, but team officials were turned off when he showed up to interview and 
ticked off what he considered problems with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"MacLeod is just too slick," one Sacramento official said. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle SuperSonics have finally given up on Nate McMillan, who was last 
among all starting point guards in shooting percentage and scoring for 1988-89. 
Avery Johnson is the new starter. "I don't know if Avery can do it," Coach 
Bernie Bickerstaff said. "But we need to give him the opportunity. We've got to 
find someone who can create offensive opportunities for other players." . . . 
Detroit Coach Chuck Daly, on Golden State's Chris Mullin: "I've got to be 
honest with you. I never thought Chris would have this much impact in the NBA. 
I mean, I knew he'd be a good player in this league, but like this? No. 
Everyone knew he could shoot, but I don't think anyone thought he could pass, 
rebound and run the show like he does." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take 5-year-old Danny Grunfeld long to catch on while watching his 
father, New York assistant Coach Ernie Grunfeld, play in a recent old-timers' 
game at Madison Square Garden. "Daddy doesn't pass very much, does he?" Danny 
said to his mom. . . . After Dallas' Adrian Dantley completed the first 
scoreless game of his career, playing only 13 minutes in the process, Coach 
Richie Adubato approached him in the locker room to explain the shortage of 
playing time. Dantley waved him off. "Don't worry about it," he told Adubato. 
"I'm not Mark Aguirre."

ANDERSON 76ERS PAST PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Barkley scored 32 points and Hersey Hawkins 27, but Ron Anderson made 
perhaps the greatest contribution Monday night at Philadelphia as the 76ers 
beat the Indiana Pacers, 120-116. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was traded from Indiana to Philadelphia before the start of last 
season, came off the bench to score 21 points, including nine in the fourth 
quarter. His two free throws with seven seconds remaining helped clinch the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to win against them, but it's really old hat now and nothing really 
extra special," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who has struggled with his shooting this season, made nine of 16 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, who shot 61%, made 10 of 17 three-point shots. Reggie Miller made 
four of six three-pointers and finished with a career-high 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
George McCloud's three-point basket with eight seconds to left narrowed 76ers' 
lead to 118-116 before Anderson's free throws clinched it. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 126, Charlotte 113 -- Greg Anderson scored a season-high 28 points at 
Milwaukee to lead the Bucks to their eighth victory in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte, the NBA's only winless team on the road, is 0-13 as a visitor this 
season and has lost 14 consecutive away games dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Pierce scored 23 points, and Alvin Robertson and Jay Humphries each added 
17 for the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam had 25 points and J.R. Reid 21 for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 110, Seattle 96 -- The Mavericks, avenging a 47-point loss in their last 
meeting against the SuperSonics, got 21 points from Rolando Blackman at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's leading scorer, Dale Ellis, was assessed two technical fouls and 
ejected in the second quarter, bringing to an end a 256-game streak in which he 
reached double figures in scoring. Ellis scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics defeated the Mavericks, 117-70, in November in a game that some say 
led to the firing of Coach John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier McDaniel had 19 for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 111, San Antonio 102 -- Scott Skiles hit a key three-point basket and 
Otis Smith sank five free throws in the final 1:09 at Orlando as the Magic 
ended an eight-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was only the third in the last 19 games for the expansion Magic, 
but all have come against division leaders -- the other two against the Lakers 
and Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Theus had 23 points for Orlando and Smith came off the bench to score 
21. Mark Acres had 14 points and a career-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 32 points for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 108, Sacramento 96 -- Kevin Duckworth had a season-high 26 points and 
Clyde Drexler added 25 as the Trail Blazers beat the Kings at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 75-73, at the end of the third quarter, the Trail Blazers had an 11-0 
run midway through the fourth to jump ahead and deal Sacramento its 13th defeat 
in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ainge, who scored 11 consecutive points during 15-0 third-quarter run by 
the Kings, finished with 24. 
</P>
<P>
Warriors 139, Nuggets 122 -- Rookie Tim Hardaway had 19 points, 10 rebounds and 
19 assists to lead the Warriors at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Richmond scored a season-high 32 points and Chris Mullin added 30, for 
the Warriors, who won their fourth consecutive game. Michael Adams led the 
Nuggets with 26. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without head coach Doug Moe, who was back in Denver recovering from the 
flu, the Nuggets trailed by one at halftime. The lead see-sawed in the third 
quarter before the Warriors scored the final 14 points of the period to take a 
103-94 advantage.

NO. 1 KANSAS RISES, AVOIDS BIG FALL, 98-93

<TEXT>
<P>
After 33 years of waiting, Kansas' stay as the No. 1 team in the nation nearly 
ended in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Jayhawks got a wake-up call early in the second half and rallied 
from a 13-point deficit to defeat Nebraska, 98-93, in a Big Eight Conference 
opener Monday night at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska (6-6) took a 61-48 lead with 16 minutes left on Kelly Lively's jump 
shot. But Kansas (16-0) responded with 12 consecutive points and took the lead 
for good, 82-81, on a pair of free throws by Jeff Gueldner with five minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers didn't fold when Kansas got back into the game, forcing ties, 
at 83-83 and 85-85, but went cold down the stretch, missing the front end of 
three free throw situations. Kansas stayed ahead by making 11 of 12 foul shots 
in the final three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Jayhawks moved into the No. 1 spot in the Associated 
Press poll for the first time since Wilt Chamberlain's sophomore season, 
1956-57. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Pritchard scored 22 points, 18 in the second half, and Rick Calloway 
added 21, including 15 in the final 20 minutes for Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Gueldner finished with 15 for Kansas; Pekka Markkanen added 14 and Freeman West 
13. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks won at Nebraska for the first time since 1985. The Cornhuskers won 
the last three times they played against top-ranked teams, defeating Missouri 
in 1982, Michigan in 1964 and Kansas State in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Hayes had 13 points in the first half for Nebraska as the Cornhuskers 
opened a five-point lead midway through the opening period and led, 52-42, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Richardson had 18 points for Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Indiana 69, No. 3 Michigan 67 -- The Hoosiers held the Wolverines 
scoreless for seven minutes, overcame a 20-point deficit and pulled off a Big 
Ten Conference victory at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Jones scored 14 points in the second half to lead the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (11-1, 1-1) scored 17 consecutive points as Michigan missed 11 
consecutive shots and its only free throw. The Wolverines (10-2, 0-1) had won 
10 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Griffin's basket gave Michigan a 64-52 lead with 7:58 remaining before the 
Hoosiers began their run. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Jones, who scored 20 points, brought Indiana within 64-61 
with 6:36 left, and the Hoosiers finished the run with eight consecutive free 
throws. Indiana, which trailed, 33-13, took the lead for the first time, 65-64, 
on two free throws by Calbert Cheaney with 2:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Greg Graham gave Indiana a 67-64 edge with 1:01 left and 
Jones made it 69-64 with 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Georgetown 87, Pittsburgh 71 -- Mark Tillmon scored 29 points at 
Pittsburgh to lead the Hoyas to their 12th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tillmon, who scored 39 points in Georgetown's 93-91 victory over Providence on 
Saturday, had 20 in the first half for the Hoyas (12-0, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers (5-8, 0-3), who lost their fourth consecutive game, had 22 points 
from Bobby Martin. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Louisiana State 111, Tennessee 94 -- Chris Jackson scored 33 points and 
led a 14-2 run midway through the second half that powered the Tigers in a 
Southeastern Conference game at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (8-5, 3-1), which trailed twice by 10 points in the first half, 
scored nine consecutive points to close the half and took the lead on a 
three-point basket by Ron Taylor to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (9-2, 2-1) had a 71-69 lead when Jackson scored five points as the Tigers 
pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Xavier 89, Chicago Loyola 73 -- Michael Davenport scored 26 points at 
Cincinnati to lead the Musketeers to their 10th consecutive victory in a 
Midwestern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier trailed by a point at halftime but went on a 24-12 run to start the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 104, Jacksonville 99 -- Irv Thomas scored five of his 27 points 
in the second overtime and and finished with 17 rebounds to lead the Seminoles 
at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (11-4) never led during regulation play and forced the first 
overtime on Ron Miller's layup with 42 seconds left, tying the game, 85-85. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State played both overtimes without scoring leader Tharon Mayes, who 
fouled out with four seconds left in regulation.

Sunday Silence, who won two jewels of the Triple Crown and beat Easy Goer in 
the Breeders' Cup Classic, was voted 3-year-old colt of the year in the Eclipse 
Awards, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, expected to be voted horse of the year, missed winning the 
Triple Crown when he was beaten by Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm, a leading candidate to win the 1990 Kentucky Derby and a stablemate of 
Easy Goer, was voted champion 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogden Phipps-owned Rhythm beat out Southern California-based Grand Canyon, 
whom he defeated by two lengths in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Nov. 4. 
</P>

Keith Hill's 16-foot bank shot with five seconds left Monday night gave New 
Mexico State an 83-82 Big West Conference victory over No. 7-ranked Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, off to their best start since a Final Four appearance in 1969-70,

</P>
<P>
UNLV dropped to 9-3 and 4-1.

offensively in the first half, scored a season-high 27. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV had 24 points from David Butler and 12 each from Larry Johnson and Greg 
Anthony. Johnson had a final attempt to avoid the upset, but his 12-foot 
turnaround jump shot hit the front of the rim as the Pan American Center crowd 
of 12,719 celebrated the Aggies' first victory win ever over the Runnin' 
Rebels.

EVEN WHEN STRUGGLING, BIRD IMPROVES CELTICS 
</P>

They have the greatest tradition in the National Basketball Association. The 
Boston Celtics. Parquet. Auerbach. Russell. Cousy. Havlicek. Bird. Sixteen 
championship banners. 
</P>
<P>
Love them or hate them, they are always fascinating. And because they have been 
so successful, they are intensely scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're living in the world that the Boston Celtics live in," said Celtics 
Coach Jimmy Rodgers, "you're living in a fishbowl. Anything that we do, good or 
bad, is going to be over-exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
That never has been more true than this season. After missing all but six games 
last season because of surgery on both heels, Larry Bird returned. And 
immediately, he and the Celtics were subjected to daily analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's Back -- Celtics Will Win Title. 
</P>
<P>
Celtics Lose Big To Pistons -- Celtics Old; Bird's Lost It. 
</P>
<P>
Bird Publicly Praises Former Coach K.C. Jones -- Bird Hates Jimmy Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the Celtics have survived their reported ups and downs. Last 
week, they went on a West Coast road trip and compiled a 3-0 record. Ten of 
their next 15 games are at home, and are against teams with records worse than 
.500. And they still are within striking distance of the Atlantic 
Division-leading Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are lacking in overall team speed and quickness, which could be 
their downfall. They don't get many easy baskets, which means their halfcourt 
game has to be almost perfect for them to win. 
</P>
<P>
But their biggest liability is Bird's absence. They found that out last season 
when they were 42-40, the worst record in the Bird era. They rediscovered it 
Friday when Bird sprained an ankle and missed most of the second half of the 
Los Angeles Clippers game. After it was announced that Bird would not return to 
the game, the Celtics were outscored 28-9 and went on to lose. Bird did not 
make the trip Saturday night for the Washington Bullets game. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Celtics have played better recently despite Bird making a career-low 
46 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes awhile to get to know everybody, especially when you sit out a year," 
Bird said. "It's a little bit tougher than I anticipated as far as stepping in 
and being in the flow of the game. My timing's off, my shooting's off and it 
just takes awhile to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
Bird has been his usual blunt self, but there has been a more intense 
examination of his statements, especially when Rodgers is the subject. When 
Bird publicly praised Jones, now a Seattle SuperSonics assistant, some 
suggested he actually was criticizing Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what people said," Rodgers said, "but I didn't feel that way and I 
don't think Larry intended that. Larry's always been outspoken. That's Larry. 
You've got to see through all of that and see that there's a caring about his 
game and our game and winning. And that's what's most important." 
</P>
<P>
Bird said: "I respect Jimmy and I always have." 
</P>
<P>
What irritates Bird is that he has heard some negative comments by unnamed 
teammates. Bird says there are two of them, but he won't name them. Speculation 
in Boston has centered around guard Jim Paxson, but Paxson denies he has made 
anti-Bird statements. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing about this team is that I'm the leader of this team," Bird said. 
"The guys that are not playing well are usually the ones that cry. The one 
thing that bothered me is they don't have enough guts to stand up to it and put 
their name in there about who said it. To me, that's a yellow streak down their 
back. ... So I just look at it and say they've always been quitters, they've 
always had no heart and it's the same way now." 
</P>
<P>
That's typical Bird. He is as unafraid to speak his mind as he is to take the 
big shot. People can scrutinize all they want, but Bird understands the 
obvious: The only way the Celtics can win the title is if Bird is at his best. 
And if he is, the Celtics will be dangerous in any seven-game series against 
any team. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmmm. Two of the finalists for the Sacramento Kings job were John MacLeod and 
Bob Weiss. Dick Motta was hired. MacLeod is the guy who replaced Motta when 
Motta left the Dallas Mavericks. MacLeod coached the Mavericks to the Western 
Conference finals, which is farther than they ever advanced during seven years 
under Motta. 
</P>
<P>
And Weiss, who would have been hired had Motta not accepted the job, was 
Motta's assistant in Dallas for six years. But the working relationship between 
the two did not end on ideal terms when Weiss was hired by the San Antonio 
Spurs in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
So could it be possible that Motta saw two guys he either did not respect or of 
whom he was jealous and decided to shaft both of them by taking the Kings job? 
</P>
<P>
Ugly thoughts. And about such a nice, loyal guy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Spurs' success this season, there are rumblings in San Antonio that 
the team might move. 
</P>
<P>
Spurs owner Red McCombs has never bought anything he would not sell, which is 
why he made so much money selling used cars. McCombs recently said he thought 
the Spurs with David Robinson and Larry Brown were worth $120 million. He paid 
$47 million for the team. 
</P>
<P>
Whispers are that the Spurs will move by next season. Most likely sites are 
Memphis, Tenn., and, believe it or not, Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Whispers from Houston indicate Rockets Coach Don Chaney soon may be replaced by 
Tom Nissalke, a former Rockets coach and the current Rockets television color 
announcer. ... Anyone notice that on Tuesday, Joe Barry Carroll had no points 
and no rebounds in six minutes? Didn't think so. ... Ah, that Benoit Benjamin 
is so classy. After the Clippers lost to the Detroit Pistons Wednesday, 
Benjamin showered, dressed and began spraying some rancid-smelling cologne all 
over himself. Charles Smith began fanning the air and complaining. Benjamin 
looked at reporters and said, "Might get them out of here." No one was talking 
to him, anyway. ... When Moses Malone said Atlanta Hawks Coach Mike Fratello 
needed him more than he needed Fratello, Malone had made 51.3 percent of his 
shots. In the next eight games, he made 47.3 percent ... The Denver Nuggets' 
new ownership has demoted Pete Babcock from president-general manager to 
full-time scout. Babcock has a six-year contract at $400,000 a year. Who is 
getting the best of this situation? ... The SuperSonics are shopping Nate 
McMillan, who has been demoted from starting point guard. The Sonics would like 
to package McMillan with either Brad Sellers or Olden Polynice. Targets include 
John Salley, Sam Perkins, John "Hot Rod" Williams, Antoine Carr and Dell Curry. 
McMillan-Sellers certainly is a delicious package, much like ketchup and ice 
cream.

Electrical grounding -- A story in Sunday's Real Estate section on replacing 
two-prong electrical outlets with three-prong receptacles is applicable only 
for a grounded electrical system. Many older homes do not have a grounded 
system and installing three-prong receptacles would create a potentially 
hazardous situation. If you are considering such a conversion and don't know if 
you have a grounded system, contact a licensed electrician.

NEW OWNER OF 'THE COPA' PLANS RESTORATION; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: JAMES SHERWOOD, WHO PUT THE ORIENT EXPRESS BACK ON ITS PLUSH TRACK, 
PROMISES THAT THE FAMED RIO HOTEL WILL RETURN TO ITS FORMER GLORY TOO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Copacabana Palace Hotel, a Rio landmark that once hosted European royalty 
and Hollywood movie stars but fell on hard times, has been taken over by the 
American businessman who restored Europe's Orient Express train. 
</P>
<P>
"The Copa," on Rio's famous Copacabana Beach on the South Atlantic coast, has 
been declining for more than 20 years. But James Sherwood has pledged to 
restore the hotel's glory. 
</P>
<P>
The new general manager, Philip Carruthers, would not say how much Sherwood 
paid in September to buy a controlling interest in the hotel. Local press 
estimates ran from $70 million to $100 million. But he said no expense would be 
spared to modernize and improve the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel is considered to be part of the country's heritage, so the facade 
won't be touched. But the inside will be completely modernized, so we can make 
the place successful again," Carruthers, a Brazil-reared Englishman, said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood is chairman of the London-based, $2-billion Sea Containers Ltd., a 
leading producer of shipping containers. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Containers owns 42% of Orient Express Hotels Inc., which will run the Copa. 
The purchase of the hotel is the first tourism investment in South America by 
Sherwood, whose firms already run hotels in the United States, the Bahamas, 
Italy, Scotland, England and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Orient Express Hotels refurbished the famous train of the same name, which 
during its heyday in the 1920s ran from Istanbul, Turkey, to London, crossing 
the English Channel by ferryboat. 
</P>
<P>
The train, which suspended service in the early 1970s, resumed operations in 
1983 and now makes twice-weekly runs between London and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orient Express has been re-established as a luxury form of transport, 
fully restored in 1920s style," said Carruthers, adding that Sherwood hopes to 
do the same with the Copa, once considered one of the world's 20 best hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sherwood has always been keen on the hotel. It's an imposing building on 
an extraordinary site, with wonderful black and white pavement," said Sea 
Containers Ltd. spokeswoman Naida Stancioff in London. She was referring to the 
wide mosaic sidewalk that lines the 2 1/2-mile long Copacabana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Copa, inaugurated in 1923, was the creation of Brazil's then-president 
Epitacio Pessoa, who lamented Rio's lack of a first-class luxury hotel to 
accommodate prominent visitors with the same pomp with which Pessoa was 
received in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Octavio Guinle, whose family controlled the Copa until it was 
bought by Sherwood, told Pessoa he would construct a hotel to rival Europe's 
finest if he could install a casino. At the time, Rio had no large tourist 
market and Guinle felt gambling was necessary to make the hotel profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Pessoa agreed. Guinle imported cement from Germany, marble from Italy, crystals 
from Czechoslovakia and furniture from France. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, designed by architect Joseph Gire, contains 223 rooms, including a 
huge presidential suite overlooking the ocean, 14 party rooms, a theater and 
the "Golden Room" for special attractions. The facade, inspired by hotels in 
Cannes and Nice, France, is a mix of classical styles. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has been famous for social significance -- people here say there was 
a time when coming to Rio and not staying at the Copa was like going to Rome 
and not seeing the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Maurice Chevalier, Nat King Cole, Edith Piaf and Ella 
Fitzgerald performed in the Golden Room. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has welcomed world leaders ranging from Dwight Eisenhower to Eva 
Peron, Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran. Animals were prohibited in the Copa 
after Magda Lupesco, paramour of King Carol I of Romania, kept eight Pekingese 
in her room and they ate the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
The most legendary stories concern movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
Orson Welles threw a bed into the swimming pool from his second-floor window 
after Delores Del Rio broke off their romance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Errol Flynn pranced naked through the halls. Nudity reared its head 
again in the early 1960s when Jayne Mansfield nonchalantly sat topless at pool 
side and made headlines for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Other famous guests of the Copa have included Brigitte Bardot, Joan Crawford, 
Clark Gable and Tyrone Power. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 President Eurico Dutra outlawed gambling, and the Copa casino closed. 
But the hotel continued to reign as queen of Rio's social life until 1960. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, the national capital was moved from Rio to the inland city of 
Brasilia, and the hotel lost the glamour of putting up visiting VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
The real crunch came in the 1970s, when several international firms opened 
modern five-star hotels in Copacabana. By the early 1980s the number of Copa 
employees had been cut by two-thirds, and the hotel was barely breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
"The Copa had been resting on its laurels for years. The owners were so used to 
being the hotel in Rio they felt they no longer had to compete," said 
Carruthers. 
</P>
<P>
He said current problems range from leaky plumbing to shoddy interiors. 
</P>
<P>
But renovations, set to begin by next April, should be completed by mid-1991. 
Carruthers said there are even plans to reopen the Golden Room and bring back 
world-class performers. 
</P>
<P>
"When the work is completed, the Copa will be the best hotel in Rio again," he 
said.

About 10 residents of a Chatsworth condominium complex were evacuated this 
morning when a fire broke out in the garage area, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fire in the 10200 block of Larwin Avenue was reported about 1:42 a.m., and 
about 20 firefighters had the flames controlled in 18 minutes, said Capt. 
Robert Robar. 
</P>
<P>
The fire damaged the garage area and one unit of the single-story building. 
Residents of nearby units were evacuated as a precaution. The cause of the fire 
is under investigation, but it appeared to have been caused by an electrical 
malfunction, Robar said.

WRONG RETURN ADDRESS HAS IRS RED-FACED

About 1 in 200 of the 107-million tax-form packages mailed by the IRS last 
month contained return envelopes with the wrong address, IRS spokesman Steve 
Pyrek said today. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, a taxpayer in Maryland, who normally would file to Philadelphia, 
might receive a package with an envelope carrying a Cincinnati address," Pyrek 
explained. The folks at the IRS are red-faced but say there is no reason for 
panic. He said taxpayers may change the address on the IRS envelope, but even 
if they don't, processing returns sent to the wrong address will not pose a 
problem for the IRS.

POLICE CHASE SUSPECTED CAR THIEVES THROUGH THREE COUNTIES

<P>
Authorities today chased suspected car thieves in two early morning pursuits 
through Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
One chase began in National City about 3:40 a.m. when police tried to stop a 
car for a minor traffic violation, said Lyle Whitten of the Westminster 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The driver headed north on the San Diego Freeway at speeds between 100 and 110 
m.p.h. before losing control while trying to leave the freeway in Long Beach, 
Whitten said. The car went over the side of the Lakewood Boulevard off-ramp. 
The driver and his two passengers were unharmed, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers searched the vehicle and found a scale, plastic bags and a small 
amount of a white powdery substance believed to be crystal amphetamine, Whitten 
said. The car was determined to have been stolen, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ray Praytor, 19, the driver, and JoAnn Barwick, 38, both of San Diego, 
were arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of 
drugs, Whitten said. Russell Patrick Broom, 19, of San Diego, also a passenger, 
fled and was later found in a drainage ditch near the freeway, Whitten said. He 
was arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of 
drugs, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The other chase started in Los Angeles about 1:15 a.m. when officers attempted 
to stop a car that had been reported stolen, a police spokesman said. The chase 
continued to the Mexican border, where Mexican authorities apparently shot at 
the speeding sedan. The occupants ditched the vehicle and escaped on foot.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III has told a visiting foreign minister he 
is losing hope of achieving a breakthrough that would lead to 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and said he may soon drop his initiative, 
diplomatic sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Baker sounded very pessimistic on the Middle East in a private 
meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik at the State 
Department Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very surprising and worrying," said one source present at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Bondevik urged Baker to persevere and said his initiative represents the only 
hope of progress but Baker said that with so many other things happening in the 
world, he might soon decide to devote all his time to areas where there was 
some hope of getting things done," the source said.

6 KILLED IN S. AFRICA STRIKE BATTLE

Six men were killed and at least 31 were injured today when hundreds of 
striking and non-striking rail workers battled with clubs, machetes, and other 
weapons at a train station near Johannesburg, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Union spokesmen said they received reports of more than 20 people killed and 
more than 60 injured. 
</P>
<P>
The reports could not be confirmed. Bodies still lay in blood-soaked train cars 
two hours after the clash. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman, Col. Frans Malherbe, said the battle involved about 1,000 
black men still working for South African Transport Services who confronted 
about 800 strikers in Germiston, an industrial town southeast of Johannesburg. 
The strikers had arrived at the station by train on their way to a union 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. congressional delegation said today that government reforms 
have failed to address black voting rights and that U.S. economic sanctions 
should remain in place or even be toughened.

JUSTICES REJECT RESTRICTIONS ON SEX-ORIENTED BUSINESSES

The Supreme Court today struck down a major portion of a Dallas ordinance that 
imposed strict licensing and zoning requirements on sexually oriented 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in a complex opinion that various justices joined and dissented 
from, also upheld portions of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court held that the licensing 
portion of the law, which required adult theaters and bookstores to have a 
license and inspections, "largely targets businesses purveying sexually 
explicit speech which the city concedes for the purposes of these cases are 
protected by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote that the city's procedure allows "indefinite postponement of the 
issuance of a license." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dallas scheme . . . fails to provide an avenue for prompt judicial review 
so as to minimize suppression of the speech in the event of a license denial. 
We therefore hold that the failure to provide these essential safeguards 
renders the ordinance's licensing requirement unconstitutional insofar as it is 
enforced against those businesses engaged in First Amendment activity." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was joined in that portion of the ruling by Justices John Paul Stevens 
and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice William J. Brennan Jr., joined by Justices 
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, wrote separately to join that portion 
of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In another portion of the opinion, O'Connor, supported by the entire court, 
upheld a portion of the ordinance that barred motel owners from renting rooms 
for less than 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor noted that the motel owners argue the ordinance places an 
unconstitutional burden on the right to freedom of association. 
</P>
<P>
"Any 'personal bonds' that are formed from the use of a motel room for less 
than 10 hours are not those that have 'played a critical role in the culture 
and traditions of the nation by cultivating and transmitting shared ideals and 
beliefs.' " 
</P>
<P>
In another decision released today, the high court ruled that colleges and 
universities enjoy no special privilege to withhold confidential data from 
faculty members who claim they illegally were denied tenure. The court 
unanimously rejected University of Pennsylvania arguments that "academic 
freedom" confers a privilege of confidentiality for peer review records sought 
by a faculty member who sued when denied tenure.

UTILITIES DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAX ON DEPOSITS, HIGH COURT SAYS

The Supreme Court handed the Bush Administration a $300-million setback today, 
saying utility companies don't have to pay income tax on deposits charged 
customers to ensure payment of future bills. 
</P>
<P>
The court unanimously ruled that an Indiana electric utility, Indianapolis 
Power &amp; Light Co., does not have to pay taxes when collecting such 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service estimates that more than 150 such cases involving 
over $300 million in potential taxes are pending in lower courts or before the 
tax agency. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the deposits do not 
amount to advance payments for electric service, and therefore are not income 
for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Indiana Power &amp; Light does receive some economic benefit from the 
deposits, he said, "IPL's right to retain the money is contingent upon events 
outside its control." 
</P>
<P>
The company requires the deposits from new customers whose credit worthiness is 
in doubt and existing customers with a record of late payment of their bills.

Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corp., had record revenues of $1.27 
billion last fiscal year, the quasi-government corporation reported. 
</P>
<P>
That income covered 72% of costs for the railroad passenger operation, up from 
69% a year earlier and the highest revenue-to-cost ratio in the agency's 
history, Amtrak said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1981, Amtrak revenues covered less than half of its costs. The 
difference between costs and revenues is made up by federal appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
The revenues of $1.27 billion were up from $1.1 billion a year earlier, Amtrak 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of passengers carried was down slightly, from 21.5 million to 
21.4 million. But passenger miles, defined as carrying one passenger one mile, 
rose from 5.7 billion in 1988 to 5.9 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 
30, 1989.

SOVIETS TELL COMECON IT MUST END ISOLATION

<P>
The Soviet Union today proposed that the Comecon trading bloc begin trading on 
a hard currency basis at world prices next year to end four decades of 
isolation from the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal came on the first day of a private meeting of Soviet and Eastern 
European leaders, joined by leaders of Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba. East 
European leaders welcomed the idea but said it should be implemented slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Comecon officials who briefed reporters after the session said the Soviets 
suggested hard currency trading at world market prices begin in 1991, replacing 
trading in the non-convertible Soviet ruble. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 10-nation Soviet-led trading bloc, founded in 1949, have agreed 
that a radical overhaul is needed if the group is to survive and keep pace with 
changes under way in Eastern Europe, where democracy is taking hold and members 
are abandoning central planning. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Dlouhy, a reform Communist who chairs Czechoslovakia's state planning 
commission, told reporters the Soviet proposal would be "a disaster" if 
introduced immediately and said a transitional period is essential. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said the transition 
period for fuels and raw materials should run until 1995. Other trade should be 
carried out on the basis of bilateral agreements, Mazowiecki said. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's East European allies traditionally have relied on Soviet raw materials 
as their chief source of fuel and raw supplies for their industries. 
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the first since last month's ouster and execution of 
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the decline of Communist power 
elsewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1949, Comecon -- the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance -- 
provided Josef Stalin's Soviet Union with a mechanism for extracting favorable 
trade agreements from client states. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one years later, the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cut 
loose Warsaw Pact states it once kept in the fold by force and Comecon will 
thus crumble if the trade relationships within it are not reforged. 
</P>
<P>
Trade relationships within Comecon had been based on agreements between 
state-owned industries in centrally planned economies that did not work. 
Observers said Comecon must now either adjust to the dismantling of such 
economic systems, already well under way in Poland and Hungary, or perish. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting's agenda included coordination of economic plans for the next five 
years, which would at the outset create a conflict.

The Eagles, the band that defined the hugely popular "California sound" in the 
'70s, isn't planning a reunion despite a report Monday in the Hollywood 
Reporter. A source close to several ex-Eagles branded as "inconceivable" a 
full-scale reunion by the group which broke up amid considerable bitterness in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The source suggested speculation about a reuniting may have been triggered by 
former Eagles leaders Glenn Frey and Don Henley appearing on stage together 
last fall during two Henley concerts in Southern California and by Henley's 
subsequent comments that the two may occasionally write songs together again. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Reporter said in its report that the singer-songwriters will 
regroup this spring to record an album and, later, a concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Walsh, Don Felder and Timothy B. Schmit were in the band when the Eagles 
broke up in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Henley, 42, was touring in Japan on Monday in support of his Geffen Records 
"The End of Innocence" album. Frey, 41, records for MCA Records.

Two Los Angeles disc jockeys -- who were permanently banned from Elvis 
Presley's Graceland mansion after an incident last year -- brought a 15-foot 
replica of the singer's head to a birthday celebration Monday as a "peace 
offering." 
</P>
<P>
The head, which had been part of a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade, 
briefly joined hundreds of fans gathered outside the white-columned residence. 
</P>
<P>
But then Graceland managers told the announcers to take the head and move on. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people representing 40 Presley fan clubs from around the world came 
to Memphis to mark what would have been Elvis' 55th birthday, said Patsy 
Andersen, fan club liaison for the Graceland Division of Elvis Presley 
Enterprises. Some fans cut a cake and sang happy birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The two deejays, Brian Phelps and Mark Thompson of Los Angeles rock station 
KLOS, were permanently banned from the mansion last year for using hidden 
microphones to broadcast from inside the residence, Graceland spokesman Todd 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the parade float had been "a beautiful tribute" to Presley. 
</P>
<P>
"They've taken that and changed it and turned it into something distasteful. 
It's really sad," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
The disc jockeys took the flatbed truck carrying the head to a nearby parking 
lot and broadcast for about an hour, according to a KLOS spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The head was part of a float sent to the Rose Parade by the state of 
Mississippi. It was taken to Jackson, Miss., after the stop in Memphis.

A royal breakfast of Weetabix? No joke. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles this year became an official consumer of Weetabix breakfast 
cereal, joining a couple of other famous Weetabix munchers, Queen Elizabeth II 
and the queen mother. 
</P>
<P>
The cereal, known in the United States as one of the less crunchy brands, was 
given a royal warrant by the prince of Wales for the new year, one of 18 new 
warrants granted by the heir to the British crown. 
</P>
<P>
Other healthy items on Charles' list include a bakery that makes organic bread, 
a firm described as "purveyors of dried fruits" and a pharmacy listed as 
"suppliers of homeopathic medicine." 
</P>
<P>
But just how much Weetabix does Charles eat? At what time of day? With or 
without sugar or some of that dried fruit on top? 
</P>
<P>
Nobody's talking. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can say is that we supply the royal household with a range of our 
products," Weetabix Ltd. spokesman Peter Davidson said Monday. Asked if he 
could discuss details of Charles' Weetabix fix, he said: "Absolutely not."

</P>
<P>
In the first protest, Gregory was among seven people arrested and released 
after receiving citations for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, police said Gregory, 57, the Rev. George Clements, 57, of Chicago 
and Robert Brown, 54, of Milwaukee returned to the store to continue the 
protest. They were being held after declining to pay bail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were expected to appear in Municipal Court today. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of drug paraphernalia is now legal in Wisconsin, although lawmakers 
have passed a measure that would outlaw such sales. The bill awaits the 
signature of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
In the first demonstration, protesters included Clements and the Rev. Michael 
Pfleger, two Chicago priests who oppose the sale of drug paraphernalia and have 
participated in similar demonstrations.

ASK DR. RUTH: FRENCHMEN HAVE NO SPECIAL SKILL AT ART OF LOVEMAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. RUTH WESTHEIMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is there any truth in the idea that certain ethnic groups are better 
lovers than others? If so, who's best? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is one of our most cherished ideas that French and Latin people do 
love and sex better than we do, whoever we are. I like the French legend best 
because I love Paris. Even though I lived hard years there in my youth, it is 
the city of love as well as of light. 
</P>
<P>
But in any good French novel that represents life faithfully, you will find 
sexual unhappiness. Furthermore, I have no evidence that Frenchmen are 
universally more devoted to pleasing the woman sexually than males of other 
nationalities. So I can honestly say, not just to encourage people of every 
ethnic origin but because evidence backs it up, anyone can become a splendid 
lover who wants to do so. I don't mean a stud or top geisha, or an always-ready 
cavalier, a sex machine, but a wonderful and desired lover to someone. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I thought everything was fine between us until three weeks ago. At that 
point my husband of 11 years told me he still cares for me but is not in love 
with me. He would rather be by himself than with me. He agrees to see a 
marriage counselor before talking divorce. 
</P>
<P>
A: If he says that, it may mean he would like to be talked back into liking 
your company, or to get into a dialogue that could lead to agreements between 
you. Maybe it means that, maybe not. Maybe it means he wants to get away from 
you but doesn't want to feel excessively guilty about hurting you. Maybe he 
thinks the counselor will help you adjust to the idea of divorce. As marriage 
counselor I have had that task of helping both partners to agree to divorce 
when keeping the marriage was hopeless. Not all marriages are viable. 
</P>
<P>
I only want to add this: Generally married people who stay together on good 
terms fall in and out of love with each other at times. Being in love is 
something more heightened and emotional than getting along with or liking or 
approving. It is more exciting than pure contentment -- and let me say, pure 
contentment is OK, even better than OK! But being in love is thinking of the 
other when separated and feeling a lift in the heart, an excitement at the idea 
of meeting again even if the separation has been only a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
So if your husband has fallen out of love, that doesn't necessarily mean he 
can't fall back in love, and with you. When you do go to the counselor, don't 
expect magic, but maybe there is a way to get back together with understanding 
on both sides.

East German track and field officials have recommended that discus thrower 
Wolfgang Schmidt be allowed to compete for West Germany, an East German 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The move would allow Schmidt to participate at the European Track and Field 
Championships in Split, Yugoslavia, in August, the newspaper Deutsches 
Sportecho said. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, still one of the top-ranked discus throwers in the world although he 
will be 36 next week, was dropped from the East German national team in 1981 
and jailed in 1982 after stating his wish to move to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the recommendation to the East German sports authorities was 
made by a track and field commission that included Olympic champions Juergen 
Schult, a discuss thrower, and Ulf Timmermann and Udo Beyer, both shot putters.

NCAA HITS CLEMSON ON RECRUITING VIOLATIONS

Clemson coaches are accused of more than 12 illegal recruiting contacts and of 
giving players money and encouraging boosters to do likewise from 1984 to 1988, 
according to an NCAA report released today. 
</P>
<P>
In making the report public just four days after receiving it, the school 
removed all references that might allow those named in the 15-page document to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson President Max Lennon said in a statement accompanying the report that 
the school will "take all appropriate steps to protect the integrity of the 
university" in wake of the allegations. Lennon was at the NCAA convention in 
Dallas and could not be reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If Clemson is found guilty of the violations levied by the NCAA, the school 
could be placed on probation for the second time in less than 10 years. The 
NCAA slapped Clemson with two years' probation in November, 1982, for 70 
violations that occurred between 1976 and 1982 under coaches Charlie Pell and 
Danny Ford, who was named head coach in December, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has charged the Atlantic Coast Conference school with 14 alleged rules 
violations, with the most serious being cash payments of $15 to $150 to players 
and recruits by both coaches and boosters and illegal contacts with recruits. 
</P>
<P>
In the most damaging recruiting allegation, the NCAA said that from November, 
1984, to September, 1987, six coaches made 11 illegal recruiting contacts, 
including four to high school juniors and one sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA does not allow in-person recruiting by colleges until players have 
completed the junior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also said that on at least two occasions during the fall of 1985, a 
coach gave a player $50 to $150 and told him to distribute the money to 
"selected" players. 
</P>
<P>
And twice in the spring of 1987, a "representative of the university's athletic 
interests" -- probably a booster -- gave $50 to two athletes for their personal 
use, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Three coaches also are charged with contacting two recruits more than the three 
times allowed by NCAA regulations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also questioned the financial aid provided a Clemson player during the 
1988 spring semester after the athlete's eligibility had run out. The NCAA said 
the player's financial aid exceeded the value of his scholarship because of his 
part-time work at a Clemson business, where he earned about $200 each month. 
The report does not say how many months the player worked at the business.

GLORIOUS OLD TRAFFORD SOCCER CLUB IMAGE GETTING KICKED AROUND A BIT

<P>
Old Trafford is to English soccer what Yankee Stadium is to baseball -- home of 
the most glamorous team in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the dream of many young baseball fans is to follow in the footsteps of 
Babe Ruth by playing for the New York Yankees, the ambition for hordes of 
budding English soccer stars is to play for Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
But United, rivaled only by Real Madrid in Spain as the most famous soccer club 
in the world, is in disarray. Its reputation, built 30 years ago by one man, 
the legendary manager Sir Matt Busby, is in danger of crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
The warning signs flashed across Old Trafford, the field graced by Bobby 
Charlton, George Best, Denis Law and the late Duncan Edwards, when fans began 
calling last month for the head of the current manager, Alex Ferguson, United's 
sixth since Busby. 
</P>
<P>
"Fergie Out," chanted fans on the terraces of the famous stadium after a team 
that began the new season full of promise in August lost for the third time in 
a row and the second at home. 
</P>
<P>
The slump continued. United has gone eight league games without a win, pushing 
it dangerously close to the bottom of the English First Division despite a 
spending spree to buy the best players available. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has spent more than $18 million on strengthening the team in his three 
years at United -- about $12 million since June, when Neil Webb and Mike Phelan 
were signed to bolster a midfield in which England captain Bryan Robson was so 
often a lone force. 
</P>
<P>
The best Ferguson's side had managed until this season was second place behind 
Liverpool in the 1987-88 league campaign and the quarterfinals of the F. A. 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The future, despite a vote of confidence from club Chairman Martin Edwards, 
looks bleaker for Ferguson, especially if Edwards relinquishes his control of 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
"We must begin to get things together quickly," a worried Ferguson said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Further pressure was put on Ferguson when Howard Kendall, the former Everton 
manager, who has expressed a desire for the coveted United post, was appointed 
recently at struggling local rival Manchester City. 
</P>
<P>
Success-starved fans look back not just to the heady days of the "Busby Babes" 
in the 1950s and '60s, which culminated in the 1968 European Cup triumph, but 
even to the relative success of two F. A. Cup victories under Ferguson's 
predecessor, Ron Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you have problems when the fans turn against you," Atkinson said. 
"Old Trafford is a theater for entertainment, drama and spectacle. It's not a 
stadium where you should hear bellyaching or fans bickering. That destroys the 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
The rot on the field set in with a series of injuries starting when Webb 
ruptured his Achilles' tendon in September after only four games. 
</P>
<P>
Problems were by then already widespread upstairs in a takeover saga that has 
both angered and embarrassed Busby and some of his brilliant proteges of the 
glory days, most notably Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in becoming the chairman," Charlton answered after 
suggestions he might bring dignity back to the club by taking over its top 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Busby, 81 and the club president, was moved to say: "Recent events have 
demonstrated only too clearly the problems that can arise from private 
ownership when the time comes for the club to be sold." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Knighton, a 37-year-old real estate tycoon, appeared to have bought the 
club for $31 million at the start of the season. He celebrated by taking the 
field at Old Trafford in Manchester United's famous red colors before the 
kickoff against Arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
"To continue the legend of Manchester United and provide the team that both the 
players and loyal supporters deserve, the club must have a solid financial 
base. We are dealing with a British institution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Knighton backed out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Knighton had divulged club secrets, and Charlton said, "When Mr. Knighton gave 
out confidential information which the board did not think he should have done, 
I think it cheapened the image of the club." 
</P>
<P>
United suffered another blow to its sagging reputation when a bomb scare 
interrupted an acrimonious annual meeting of the shareholders in December. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards staved off shareholders' demands for his resignation and calls for the 
club's shares to be made public.

TERRY-THOMAS, GAP-TOOTHED COMEDY ACTOR, DIES AT 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry-Thomas, the English comedy actor whose trademarks were the hyphen in his 
name and the gap between his two front teeth, died Monday in a nursing home in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
The man who brought gales of laughter to millions in the English-speaking world 
through his portrayals of sneering cads, died disabled and impoverished after a 
years-long, expensive battle with Parkinson's disease. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement from the Parkinson's Disease Society said he died of 
complications of that illness at a nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular screen personalities in his own country, Terry-Thomas 
also was a tremendous hit in the United States in several successful British 
comedies of the late 1950s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
He specialized in raffish, snobbish bureaucratic buffoons -- both military and 
civilian -- in "Man in a Cocked Heart," "I'm All Right, Jack" and "School for 
Scoundrels," British social comedies of the late '50s, and such larger scale 
American films of the '60s as "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" and "Those 
Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines." 
</P>
<P>
His signature was a cigarette-holder, a military-style mustache and lines that 
usually included "jolly good show." 
</P>
<P>
Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens, the son of upper-middle-class 
parents. As a boy, he preferred the ukulele to books, and played in school jazz 
bands before dropping out to become a clerk and later a meat salesman. 
</P>
<P>
His regular wardrobe as a salesman included a cigarette holder, silver-topped 
cane, suede shoes, yellow leather gloves, green porkpie hat and a carnation in 
his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
Said Terry-Thomas years later in his autobiography "Filling the Gap," which he 
titled in deference to the space between his teeth: "I felt that my impeccable 
appearance more than compensated for my habitual late arrival at the office." 
Perhaps it did, but his superiors were mostly reluctant to fire the young man 
because he had become a leading player in the company's drama society. 
</P>
<P>
A few years of meat sales was more than enough and what he termed "a compulsion 
to act in a funny manner" drove Stevens into show business. He began his career 
touring with a band he had organized called the Rhythm Maniacs, then did some 
professional dancing and dance instruction. 
</P>
<P>
He toured the vaudeville circuit, impersonating such diverse singers as Al 
Jolson and Paul Robeson. By 1935, he was working in films as an extra and bit 
player. He searched for a stage name. He played around with Mot Snevets (his 
given name spelled backward), thought that a wee too frivolous, and then 
experimented with Thomas Terry. The problem there was that people confused him 
with the famous Terry theatrical family. 
</P>
<P>
He settled on simply reversing the two names and became Terry Thomas. He later 
threw in the hyphen as an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
Terry-Thomas served in the Army in World War II, rising from private to 
sergeant and, by all accounts, took the war rather seriously, even developing a 
duodenal ulcer. After his term in the service, Terry-Thomas played the 
provinces for a time and was spotted by producer Sid Fields, who cast him in 
the London stage play "Piccadilly Circus." Critics lauded him as a new comic 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1946, Terry-Thomas appeared at a Royal Command Variety Performance in 
London and in prominent nightclubs in Paris and New York. He had his own radio 
show in the early 1950s in London and two television shows there. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he had several small roles in postwar films before being introduced 
to American audiences in "Private's Progress" (1956). A whole series of 
increasingly successful appearances in small but funny British movies followed. 
</P>
<P>
He played Boughtflower, a philanderer in a seashore hotel in "The Green Man" 
(1957); a bus driver hauling a group of school girls to Rome in "Blue Murder at 
St. Trinian's" (1958); and the unlovable son of a professor in "Lucky Jim" 
(1958). 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, Terry-Thomas was a certified star of comedy. New York Times critic 
Bosley Crowther wrote, in reviewing "Too Many Crooks" (1959), that 
"Terry-Thomas' skill is exercised in demonstrating how completely a mad-cap 
comedian can blow his top. His eyes flash, his lips curl; his sibilants whistle 
and he glares like a maniac." 
</P>
<P>
He also shone in the 1960 film "Man in a Cocked Hat," as the slack-jawed 
bumbler Carlton-Browne. 
</P>
<P>
That same year's "I'm All Right, Jack" featured Terry-Thomas opposite Peter 
Sellers and playing a labor relations specialist in a munitions plant with 
labor problems. In retrospect, "Man in a Cocked Hat" and "I'm All Right, Jack" 
probably were his finest films, but a long series of featured roles in satiric 
comedies -- many of them American-made -- followed. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" (1962), "The Mouse 
on the Moon" (1963), "How to Murder Your Wife" (1965), "A Guide for the Married 
Man" (1967), "Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies" (1969), "The 
Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971), "The Last Remake of Beau Geste" (1977) and "The 
Hound of the Baskervilles" (1978). 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, Terry-Thomas battled several rounds of illnesses. He was 
hospitalized in 1976 with heart problems and pneumonia, then again in 1982 with 
Parkinson's disease. He could often be seen, when healthy, horseback riding in 
London's Hyde Park. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, vibrant man (6 feet, 195 pounds) before he fell ill, Terry-Thomas was 
married twice -- to dancer Ida Patlansky in the 1930s and, in 1963, to Belinda 
Cunningham, by whom he had two sons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 he said: "Parkinson's disease, apart from being hell to live with, has 
almost busted me financially. It frightens me just how much it has cost. And it 
has been very tough on Belinda. She has no life of her own -- absolutely none." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 the couple were forced to sell their Mediterranean villa and return to 
London because of the financial strain of his disease. 
</P>
