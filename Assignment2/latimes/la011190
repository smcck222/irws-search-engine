D. F. BOWLER; SENT COHEN TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald F. Bowler, the former Internal Revenue Service intelligence chief for 
Southern California, best known for sending mobster Mickey Cohen to prison on 
tax-evasion charges, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler, more recently chief of the district attorney's Bureau of Investigation 
for Los Angeles County, was 69 when he was found dead at his Canoga Park home 
early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran prosecutor and investigator, Bowler was a member of the original 
federal Organized Crime Strike Force Committee when it was formed in Buffalo, 
N.Y., in 1966-67. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960 and 1961, he directed the grand jury investigation that led to Cohen's 
lengthy prison sentence for concealing about $400,000 from tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler entered IRS service after graduating from Loyola University in Los 
Angeles. He served 22 years and retired to become a vice president of 
International Intelligence Inc., a private firm, and resigned in 1976 to join 
the district attorney's staff. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired from the district attorney's office in 1981 he was division 
chief for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Betty, and five children. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral Mass is scheduled for Saturday at 9 a.m. at Our Lady of the Valley 
Catholic Church, Canoga Park. Burial will be at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, 
Mission Hills.

AL MARTINEZ: CIAO TO THE CHARDONNAY RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I like watching football as well as the next guy, requiring as it does no 
special capacity to think, evaluate or otherwise rise to new heights of 
intellectual or spiritual achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Those who repair washing machines can enjoy the sport on an equal basis with 
Ph.Ds in astrophysics, jumping and shouting with the airy enthusiasm of 
children at play. 
</P>
<P>
There is an egalitarian quality to the sport, much as there is to a religious 
gathering, and all can gather to pray or cheer regardless of race, creed or an 
ability to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
When the cheering or praying ends, we go our separate ways, of course, but at 
least our souls have touched for a moment like angels in flight, and there 
might be something to be said for that. 
</P>
<P>
But I ask you: Is any group of young men whose only obvious talents lie in 
their ability to run, kick, block or catch worth about $200 million to keep in 
town? 
</P>
<P>
I think not. 
</P>
<P>
I refer, of course, to efforts under way to persuade the Raiders to remain in 
Los Angeles -- including Wednesday's offer to rebuild the Coliseum -- or at 
least to replace them with another football team of equal virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
That shouldn't be difficult, since they've been playing like zombies most of 
the seven years they've been in L.A. Even in moments of triumph they manage to 
seem incredibly dull. How expensive should zombies be? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't just the won-lost record I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders never belonged here in the first place. They were champions in 
Oakland, a town that still drinks boilermakers, but wilted like roses in the 
desert in a city that sips white wine. 
</P>
<P>
Wasp-witted Jerry Belcher, who had a name for everything, began referring to 
them as the Chardonnay Raiders when they came to L.A., such was the languor of 
their style under the palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
In their days up north, the team won a reputation for being quick and rough and 
giving no quarter. If football is a game of Christians and lions, it was best 
to be lions, and the Raiders were just that. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs was a survival syndrome that reflected the city in which they were born 
and in which they rose to new heights of Sunday violence. 
</P>
<P>
Ain't that what sport is all about? 
</P>
<P>
Oakland grew up using its back rather than its wit, and thrives today because 
it has never stopped struggling. It's a town that eats steak, not quiche, and 
would still rather see Tempest Storm twirl her tassels than Jane Fonda flatten 
her behind. 
</P>
<P>
When the Raiders left in 1982, it was like Oakland's heart had been ripped out. 
Almost everybody seems to leave Oakland. Even Amelia Earhart took off one day 
and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, on the other hand, is big and rich and loaded with more of 
everything than St. Elvis has disciples, and the Raiders reflect that. We don't 
struggle, we do lunches. We don't take chances, we take meetings. 
</P>
<P>
We shuffle around in Gucci loafers, boost our egos with silicone breast 
implants and would rather die than do without a tummy tuck. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. is oat bran, Oakland is a baloney sandwich. L.A. is Sunset Boulevard, 
Oakland is East 14th Street. They founded the Hell's Angels, we gave the world 
the Flying Nun. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders belong in a town that sweats and spits, not in one that watches its 
complex carbohydrates. I say send them sailing back to Oakland with a 
tippy-fingers high five and wish them raw meat for lunch off the Nimitz 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Now about that $200 million that seems so readily available to build a new 
stadium and to sweeten the tea of the team that occupies it. We don't need 
another football team to enhance a city's big-league style. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Rams are near enough to satisfy any residual urge for a bunch of 
guys who can crack heads and break legs with impunity. We've got bone-crushers 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
What we don't have is a full medical facility dedicated to the cure of AIDS and 
to the treatment of its victims. 
</P>
<P>
What we don't have is adequate housing facilities for those on the streets, or 
enough places to feed the hungry in an economically lopsided society. 
</P>
<P>
Our list of needs would light the fires of hell for eternity, but the 
alleviation of those needs could brighten heaven beyond time. 
</P>
<P>
Channeling money to alleviate despair won't result in bankable profit. No one's 
going to get rich. But it would enhance the city's image as big league in a way 
that football never could. It would be an investment in human resources that 
not even a touchdown in the Super Bowl could surpass. 
</P>
<P>
So ciao to the Chardonnay Raiders. Let them go back to Oakland or to wherever 
the caprice of cash takes them, while we ponder the value of the money we were 
willing to spend to keep them . . . and come out winners without them.

<P>
It sounds as though the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency can find 
plenty of things lovelier than a tree. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo regarding traffic congestion in Hollywood, the agency said one 
possible solution would be "creating major diversions (e.g., planted roadway 
medians) to reduce the attractiveness of Highland Ave. to through traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like trees and bushes and grass to reduce the attractiveness of a 
roadway, right? 
</P>
<P>
It sort of brings to mind Ogden Nash's parody of Joyce Kilmer: 
</P>
<P>
I think that I shall never see 
</P>
<P>
A billboard lovely as a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, unless the billboards fall, 
</P>
<P>
I'll never see a tree at all. 
</P>
<P>
As a companion piece to William Reagh's "1990: The Changing Face of L.A.," 
local history buffs can avail themselves of a second calendar -- "Angel City 
Trolley: Streetscapes from the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
Published by Photoventures Co., it covers the final years of the Red Car and 
Yellow Car trolley lines, the city's first mass transit system; the one that 
many drivers wish had never been dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
The publication also recalls "the days," historian Bruce Henstell points out, 
"when Angelenos shopped Downtown in stores like Leed's, and then took in a 
movie at the Newsreel, which showed nothing but the news of the day." 
</P>
<P>
The calendar includes several L.A.-ish milestones, such as this entry for Sept. 
30: 
</P>
<P>
"James Dean's last meal: Brunch at the Farmer's Market (1955)." 
</P>
<P>
Elvis-Head Sightings (cont.): 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Graceland, the Northpark Shopping Mall of Ridgeland, Miss., welcomed the 
floral noggin of the King. But the 15-foot-tall bust would not fit through the 
entrance. So it will go on display outside the mall for a week, mall marketing 
director Becky Orsi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then who knows what'll happen to the head," Orsi added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relations between Tennessee and Mississippi were reported as tense. 
</P>
<P>
Graceland had originally given permission to Mississippi -- Presley's 
birthplace -- to construct the bust for the Tournament of Roses Parade. The 
Memphis, Tenn., mansion has since condemned the float's post-parade odyssey, 
led by two KLOS disc jockeys, as undignified. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've been had by the state of Mississippi," said Graceland 
executive director Jack Soden. 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . at least, as the Jackson, Miss., Clarion-Ledger put it: "The King 
has found a new place to dwell." 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles Without a Map," one of the newest members of the genre of L.A. 
novels, revives memories of the 1980s. (Remember them?) The story revolves 
around a Playboy Bunny who's an aspiring/perspiring actress. 
</P>
<P>
Author Richard Rayner unveils a cast of Angelenos that includes a British 
screenwriter who works as a mannequin in a wax museum, a pool cleaner who 
dreams of starting a TV ministry, a Ship's cafe chef who writes submarine movie 
scripts, a Cambodian taxi driver who composes violin sonatas, an insurance 
salesman who also plays back-up for an Elvis look-alike, and a man who 
videotapes parties at his house so he doesn't have to attend them. 
</P>
<P>
The typical crew at any L.A. party. 
</P>
<P>
Their lives are more or less summed up by one character who says: "Another year 
and I know I'll make it. I've just got to get through the next year." 
</P>
<P>
Bravest of all, perhaps, is the Brit. He doesn't know how to drive.

A FAMILY STANDING UP TO GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Testifying against accused murderers would be difficult for anyone, but it is 
an act of courage for a Santa Ana family who witnessed a gang shooting last 
September. The shooting, one of the worst such incidents to ever occur in 
Orange County, left two people dead, including a 4-year-old boy, and several 
persons wounded. But it was only the beginning of terror for the family of 
Isabel and Ralph Rodriguez, who, with their four children, watched in horror as 
the shooting occurred near their home. 
</P>
<P>
The child who died was a cousin of Isabel Rodriguez; the other victim was a 
17-year-old who police believe was a gang member. The shooting is believed to 
have resulted from gang rivalries, and three young men later arrested as 
suspects in the killings are members of another gang. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Rodriguez family are determined to give their eyewitness account 
at a preliminary hearing in February despite a reign of terror by neighborhood 
thugs. The harassment has escalated from name-calling and beer bottles thrown 
at their house to death threats, a fire bomb bouncing off a bedroom window and 
an attempt to run down a Rodriguez child. Finally, last week, police arrested 
two gang members for witness intimidation and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arrests, police have stepped up patrols in the Rodriguez 
neighborhood. The family has taken to bedding down the children on the floor, 
afraid of stray bullets. It is, as Isabel Rodriguez said, "pure hell." 
</P>
<P>
A deputy district attorney said that the arrests and warrants are an indication 
that witness intimidation will not be tolerated. To do so, he added would make 
"a joke of the whole criminal justice system." We agree. Police must do 
everything possible to protect the Rodriguez family now, and after they 
testify. The children also must be assured of safety at school. 
</P>
<P>
Not all witnesses would be as resolute as the Rodriguezes. We commend their 
courage in standing up against frightening intimidation and for paying a 
personal price to see that justice is done.

WATER SHORTAGES IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In typically bureaucratic fashion, the editorial again suggests support to 
restrictions on watering lawns and gardens as apparently the key solution to 
water conservation. I'll bet my mortgage we "faceless dogs" will next be told 
to establish rigid accountability of how often we wash our armpits and flush 
our toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Come on! Is this our best shot? No way! 
</P>
<P>
I fully appreciate the need for water conservation but I expect water 
conservation measures to be more creative, widespread, and practiced equally by 
all users. 
</P>
<P>
It is especially disturbing to me to see construction of street medians and 
freeway sidings consisting of grass, shrubs and trees that require regular 
watering, and other maintenance we can ill afford. Where are the regulations 
that put restrictions on these extravagant practices and place heavy fines on 
violations? 
</P>
<P>
I say ban the use of vegetation entirely, wherever feasible, and encourage the 
use of brick/stone or other materials that require no water at all. Where 
vegetation is permitted, the watering should be of the drip/soak type.

CISNEROS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a letter (Dec. 28) by Debra J. Reed, I would like to point out 
that Ms. Reed takes out of context a quote of mine from an article ("Deals Won 
Jail Informant Freedom to Attack Again," Dec. 11). In the first place, there 
were no "deals" made with Stephen Cisneros on the Bittaker case. 
</P>
<P>
A letter accurately stating what Cisneros did for Sheriff's Homicide in dealing 
with the key witness in the case was written at the request of Cisneros' 
defense attorney. The letter was not written as the result of a "deal" but as 
the result of a legitimate request by Cisneros' defense attorney to present 
those facts to the judge who was to sentence Cisneros on an unrelated case. 
</P>
<P>
My statement that Cisneros was a "small, teeny little offshoot" of the Bittaker 
case (not of any informant program) was said to put the incident into 
perspective. The Bittaker case was a very complex case which took a year for 
investigation and preparation. Cisneros played a small role in the total case 
and was never used as a witness. I certainly feel bad that Cisneros went on to 
become a rapist but, frankly, it is quite evident that Cisneros would have 
become a rapist whether or not the letter was written.

NEW WORDS BUT SAME OLD MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Li Peng took to China's airwaves yesterday to announce that martial law 
was being ended in Beijing, seven months after it was decreed in a move to 
crush swelling popular protests. As Li finished his 10-minute speech, the 
official radio began blaring a concert of triumphant martial music. The irony, 
however unintended, was clearly appropriate. Still fully in place, along with a 
heavy presence of troops in the capital, are other repressive measures that 
make it a crime to strike, to display political posters, to take part in 
anti-government demonstrations. Though martial law has been lifted, the Chinese 
are no freer the day after that event than they were the day before. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not everyone sees it that way. Vice President Dan Quayle, for one, 
has hailed the ending of martial law as a "step forward for human rights" and a 
vindication of President Bush's policy of engaging in secret high-level 
contacts with Chinese leaders starting just a month after the June 4 massacre 
of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of protesters in central Beijing. It may 
well be true that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, on his two 
unannounced visits to Beijing, urged China's leaders to ease up on repression 
so as to forestall further punitive responses from Congress. But it's insulting 
to all those who died last June or who have been imprisoned or executed since 
to confuse an expedient and cosmetic lifting of martial law with any genuine 
improvement in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Economic woes couldn't have been far from the mind of the leadership when it 
decided to end martial law. The World Bank is considering a $700-million loan 
package to China, which helps explain Li's insistence that his country is now 
"stable politically, economically and socially." The White House said Wednesday 
that it might well support the Chinese loan application. But federal law 
forbids endorsing loans to a country that is a "gross and consistent violator 
of human rights." Tragically for its people and unhappily for their economic 
future, China continues to fit that bleak description.

WHAT IF MOM DOES WEAR COMBAT BOOTS?

<TEXT>
<P>
If Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) and others in her liberal ideological foxhole 
have their way, women will be assigned to combat roles for the first time in 
American history. Such a decision would be bad for the military and bad for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, if women are allowed to be assigned to combat units, they would 
lose their only protection against the draft. Should Congress decide to restore 
the draft because of some future threat, the courts would surely rule that to 
exempt women discriminates against men. 
</P>
<P>
Would you want your daughter, sister, wife or mother to be forced into combat? 
</P>
<P>
The idea of sending women to kill enemy men is contrary to our historical 
experience, common sense and American social mores. It would destroy the unique 
bonding between men in military services that is required for a disciplined, 
effective fighting force. War is not a social experiment. 
</P>
<P>
This nation is not ready for body bags carrying dead females. Continuing to bar 
women from combat roles is in the best interest of the country. Congress, the 
Pentagon and the President ought to put a stop to this bad idea before it 
advances any more. Otherwise that childhood taunt, "Your mother wears combat 
boots," might turn out to be true.

For the second time, I received a letter back from state Rep. Dana Rohrabacher

HO-HUM, IT'S ANOTHER ROAD WIN FOR CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Onward go the Clippers, as if they are supposed to be beating these teams. 
</P>
<P>
Such a crazy notion. But such a crazy trip. Would you believe Clippers 115, 
Atlanta 109? 
</P>
<P>
It happened Wednesday night before 11,817 at the Omni, earning the Hawks a spot 
alongside Minnesota, Boston and Charlotte as victims of a to-be-completed 
eight-game tour in which the Clippers have surpassed all immediate 
expectations. Even their coach's. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say it's unbelievable," Don Casey said. "I just didn't think it would 
happen to this extent. But they (the players) are on a mission." 
</P>
<P>
It became a success long before Wednesday, even if not by record. The Clippers 
beat Minnesota, lost to defending NBA champion Detroit by four points, won at 
Boston Garden for the first time since 1979, lost to New York by a point in 
overtime when Ron Harper's virtual layup got an unforgiving bounce off the 
front of the rim, and then beat Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Hawks, the Clippers' first in 10 tries, would seem like a 
nice encore if it didn't come off looking so much like the start of something. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a timetable for this team coming together," Casey said. "But it 
looks good right now." 
</P>
<P>
When the Clippers (14-18) travel to Milwaukee today, it will be by plane. It's 
just a little quicker than walking on air. 
</P>
<P>
Consider what it meant to beat the Hawks in Atlanta for the first time since 
Dec. 30, 1981: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Clippers won back-to-back road games for the first time since Nov. 20 
and 24, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By opening 4-2 on this trip, they have equaled last season's total number 
of road wins and are guaranteed no worse than a .500 record on their longest 
trip of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The latter was the players' most prominent goal, and at the outset it seemed 
strictly like dream material. This was the same team, after all, that began the 
season 0-10 away from the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We just know that every time we get ready to play now, whether it's at home or 
on the road, that we can win," said guard Gary Grant, who had 16 points and 11 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Part of this victory, Casey insists, does stretch back to the Sports Arena. 
Specifically, to the desk of General Manager Elgin Baylor, who engineered the 
trade for Harper nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This win I'll give credit to Elgin for getting Harper," Casey said. "That 
s.o.b. doesn't let you lose." 
</P>
<P>
He meant Harper, who scored 25 of his game-high 37 points in the second half, 
including 10 in the fourth quarter. Nine of those came in the final 3:42, the 
first basket breaking a 102-102 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The lead reached 108-102 before the Hawks (18-14) responded to pull within 
108-107. Then Harper made two free throws with 33 seconds remaining and knocked 
the ball away from Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins to start a fast break he 
culminated with a slam dunk. The Clippers were ahead, 112-107, making one last 
fast-break stuff and subsequent free throw important only for the highlight 
reel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not on any timetable," said Harper, who also had nine assists. "If we're 
a team, we're going to play good. We don't want to wait for the second half of 
the season to play good." 
</P>
<P>
They're not, and neither is Danny Manning. After scoring 16 points at New York 
and 22 at Charlotte, the Clipper forward hit 11 of 16 shots for a season-high 
27 points. He also had nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Danny is starting to feel comfortable playing the game again," Harper 
said. "He was a little down the last two or three weeks, but he is coming back, 
doing the things that it takes to win games." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Don King, best known as a boxing promoter, has been cleared by the National 
Basketball Players Assn. to become an NBA agent and will represent Clipper 
center Benoit Benjamin in future negotiations. King had been a member of the 
self-named Team Benjamin since last summer. Now, he has a title and a more 
prominent role, while Henry Holmes, the previous agent, will handle Benjamin's 
personal matters. "It makes me feel good," Benjamin said. "I know he and Mike 
(Tyson) are always supportive of everything I do and will continue to help me 
and my career. Now it's official. He (King) can go to work and do what he does 
best." King was notified of his approval late last week, according to Charles 
Grantham, executive director of the NBPA, which certifies all player 
representatives. The process normally takes three to five weeks, Grantham said, 
but King's background check was "exhaustive" because of past and current legal 
entanglements. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone led Atlanta with 27 points and 11 rebounds. . . . The Clippers' 
14th victory last season came March 22. . . . After first hearing that Ken 
Norman would probably rejoin the team for Friday's game at Milwaukee, coaches 
were told Wednesday their injured starting forward will not make it back for 
either of the final two games on the trip. Norman is nursing a strained groin.

LAKERS SHOW ORLANDO THAT THEY DON'T FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call them elitist snobs, if you must, but the Lakers think they should never, 
ever lose to an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
But on Dec. 10, the Lakers smugly went into Florida, blew a 14-point lead and 
lost to the Orlando Magic. Laker players called that loss inexcusable, 
especially since some guaranteed they would not lose to expansionists. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night was a form of retribution. The Lakers once again built a big 
lead against the Magic, but this time they held on for a 121-106 victory before 
16,534 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember it?" an incredulous Byron Scott repeated. "Of course, we remember it 
like it was yesterday. A team of our caliber, we shouldn't lose to them. But I 
guess that happens." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, do games such as Wednesday night's pay back. This victory, the Lakers' 
24th in 32 games, was as expected as their earlier loss in Orlando was 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
It ended a stretch of four games in five nights in three cities, in which the 
Lakers recovered from a road loss at Golden State to hammer the Miami Heat, 
then recovered from an overtime loss at Phoenix to easily handle the Magic. "I 
thought we played very, very well," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We had a good 
bounce back from (Tuesday night's loss to the Suns). A lot of things we didn't 
do last night we did tonight, primarily challenging drives (to the basket) and 
contesting shots and rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers pretty much did what they wanted to against the Magic (10-24), who 
will never be confused with the Suns. They resurrected their fast break, worked 
the ball inside and made 53.7% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, sitting out the fourth quarter, scored 16 points and had 13 
assists. Orlando Woolridge, who made his first six shots, came off the bench 
for 18 points. Not bad for headline writers just waiting to say that Orlando 
and Magic turned back the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson and Woolridge were not the only productive Lakers. Scott, regaining 
his touch by making nine of 17 shots, scored 10 of his 20 points in the third 
quarter. A.C. Green had 13 points and nine rebounds. James Worthy added 15 and 
Vlade Divac 12. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Heat, which lost by 39 points to the Lakers, the Magic did not give 
in easily. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic trailed, 98-74, entering the fourth quarter, but kept battling and, 
led by Otis Smith's 28 points, made the final deficit a slightly more 
respectable 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Guokas, coach of the Magic, realistically knew there was little chance of 
his team repeating what happened last month in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"That would've been a little too much to ask," Guokas said. "We got our win 
(over the Lakers). We'll take it. . . . We didn't offer too much resistance. 
They methodically did basically whatever they had to do to take control. I'd 
have to say they are the best in the league we've seen so far." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' 24-8 record is the league's best. Of their eight defeats, Laker 
players seem most upset about the Dec. 10 loss at Orlando. Maybe because they 
had that 14-point lead with six minutes to play. Or maybe because they shot 
only 39.3% that night. Nothing needed to be said about that loss. Laker coaches 
simply inserted the tape of the game into a video recorder before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That loss stung," said center Mychal Thompson, who had eight points in 21 
minutes. "In all my 12 years of playing pro basketball, that was the loss that 
hurt me most. . . . It was the first time I've seen this team at a loss for 
words about what happened. We were like contestants on 'Jeopardy' who didn't 
know the answers." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's equation was quite simple: The Lakers, coming off a tough 
road loss and playing a team that upset them a month before, rolled to an easy 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came in tonight to get the job done, and we did," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
NBA officials reportedly are balking at the proposed one-on-one game between 
Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, tentatively set for sometime this summer. 
Johnson said he would still like to play the game, but not if the league 
disapproves. "We already proposed what we wanted to do, and it's up to (the 
league) now," Johnson said. "The decision is theirs. I came up with the idea 
last summer. We approached (Jordan's representatives). He agreed. We agreed. 
The Fox network was going to do it, but we settled on pay-per-view. But, like I 
said, it's (the league's) decision." 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson, who played 28 minutes Tuesday night despite continued soreness 
in his left heel, said Wednesday he is not concerned about the potentially 
adverse effects of playing on consecutive nights. "If I rest it a week, it's 
the same soreness as if I play the next night," Thompson said. "It doesn't make 
any difference how much I rest it. It's still sore." Thompson said his heel 
bothers him most when he tries to play after sitting for prolonged spells. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve center Mark McNamara suffered a severe bruise on the back of his left 
knee during Sunday night's victory over the Miami Heat. He had swelling around 
his knee, but suited up anyway Tuesday night against Phoenix and for 
Wednesday's game. . . . The Lakers' next game is Friday night against the 
Houston Rockets at the Forum.

TONIGHT'S GAMES 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA STATE (8-4, 2-2) at No. 19 UCLA (9-2, 3-0), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV: None. Radio: KMPC (710). 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hoped to gain prestige with a strong showing last Sunday at Louisville, 
but the Bruins were blown out, 97-80, on national television. They hope to 
rebound against an Arizona State team that has won eight of its last nine 
games, losing only to No. 1-ranked Kansas in the last month. The Sun Devils, 
though, are without their No. 2 scorer, guard Matt Anderson, who underwent 
arthroscopic surgery Monday to repair torn cartilage in his right knee and will 
be out for four to six weeks. Anderson, last season's Pac-10 three-point 
shooting percentage leader, averaged 14.2 points a game and made 19 of 43 
three-point shots before injuring his knee Saturday night. He'll be replaced by 
freshman Brian Camper from Lakewood High. Forward Alex Austin averages 17.5 
points and 7.5 rebounds for ASU. His brother, Isaac, averages 13.9 and 5.3. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 ARIZONA (8-2, 3-2) at USC (5-5, 0-3), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070). 
</P>
<P>
After losing to No. 19 UCLA and Notre Dame, the Trojans will try to snap their 
losing streak against the Wildcats. Arizona has won seven consecutive games 
against USC, the last six by an average of 31 points. USC freshman guard Harold 
Miner has averaged 24 points in his last four games. Trojan forward Ronnie 
Coleman is coming off the best two games of his career, having scored 27 points 
against the Bruins and 26 against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
WEST COAST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 LOYOLA MARYMOUNT (9-3) at SANTA CLARA (3-10), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KXLU-FM (88.9). 
</P>
<P>
As the only team with a winning record in the West Coast Conference, Loyola 
becomes the focus of its seven rivals, enhancing what has become a lively 
rivalry with Santa Clara. Loyola's Bo Kimble is averaging 44.6 points and 9.5 
rebounds over the last seven games while shooting 66% from three-point range. 
Hank Gathers, averaging 25.1 points a game, and Jeff Fryer, averaging 21.5, 
appear to be regaining their form. Santa Clara, tall and methodical, has always 
managed to slow Loyola's pace, but the Broncos are off to their worst start in 
Coach Carroll Williams' 20th season and were routed in their WCC opener last 
week by U. San Diego, 96-71. Swing man Jeffty Connelly, who has been injured, 
leads the offense with a 13-point average. Forward Nils Becker is averaging 
12.4 points and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
PEPPERDINE (6-7, 0-0) at SAN DIEGO (6-7, 1-0), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670). 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury hopes that his team's on-again, off-again play in 
nonconference games will serve as a blueprint for strong performances against 
conference teams, just as it did last year. Asbury said the Waves struggled 
last year prior to beginning conference play and then held at least a share of 
first place until the final weekend of the season. The Waves average nearly 19 
turnovers a game, and have been outrebounded by a margin of 3.7 a game. 
Opponents have been getting most of their rebounds on the offensive boards. 
North Carolina defeated the Waves, 95-69, Saturday at Chapel Hill, N.C. San 
Diego is coming off a 96-71 victory at home over Santa Clara in a WCC opener. 
The Toreros are led by John Jerome, a 6-foot-8 senior center who transferred 
from Arizona State. Jerome is averaging 19.3 points and 6.9 rebounds. Reserve 
forward Dexter Howard, averaging 14.8 points, leads five Waves in double 
figures. This game was incorrectly reported as being a Wednesday night game in 
Wednesday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
FRESNO STATE (6-6, 1-2) at CAL STATE FULLERTON (6-5, 0-2), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KMNY (1600). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is home after losing five of six games on the road. The Titans have 
not played in Titan Gym since Dec. 16, when a victory over Cal State Northridge 
gave them a 5-0 record. Forward Cedric Ceballos, averaging 22.2 points a game, 
has recovered from a brief slump. Guard Mark Hill, averaging 21.8 points, has 
been the Titans' leading scorer in seven of the last eight games. Fresno State 
relies heavily on sophomore guards Wilbert Hooker and Tod Bernard. When they 
each score in double figures, the Bulldogs are 5-1. Hooker is averaging 15.6 
points, and Bernard is averaging 14.7, 18.7 against conference opponents. Chris 
Henderson, a junior forward who transfered from DePaul, has been a key 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
CS LONG BEACH (9-2, 2-1) at UC IRVINE (2-11, 0-4), 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KORG (1190). 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are 9-2 for the first time since the 1973-74 season when Lute Olson 
was the coach. That team finished with a 24-2 record. This season, Long Beach 
has lost only to Indiana and Nevada Las Vegas. The 49ers have been off since 
beating Fresno State, 66-60, last Thursday. Irvine lost its sixth consecutive 
game and shot less than 40% for the fourth game in a row in a 70-58 loss to the 
University of the Pacific Tuesday in Stockton. Irvine hasn't won a conference 
game at home since it defeated San Jose State, 91-69, Feb. 9, 1989. Since then, 
the Anteaters are 0-7, including 0-2 this season. Center Ricky Butler leads 
Irvine with a 15-point average.

Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker breezed to easy first-round victories Wednesday at 
the New South Wales Open at Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, seeded No. 1, beat Canada's Andrew Sznajder, 6-1, 6-3, and West 
Germany's Boris Becker powered his way to a 6-3, 6-2 win over Alexander Volkov 
of the Soviet Union in a match that lasted just 72 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Pete Sampras of Palos Verdes, beat Tim Mayotte 6-7 (8-6), 
2-6, and Stanford's David Wheaton surprised sixth-seeded Andres Gomez, 7-5, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to the second round were American Aaron Krickstein, Sweden's 
Mats Wilander, West Germany's Carl-Uwe Steeb and France's Yannick Noah. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg won easily in the first two matches of the Rio 
Challenge tournament at Adelaide, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe made quick work of France's Henri Leconte, 6-0, 6-2, and Edberg 
defeated Australian Darren Cahill, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg was too strong and consistent for Cahill, who is attempting to comeback 
after a knee operation last month. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ramesh Krishnan of India struggled past New Zealander Bruce 
Derlin, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5, to reach the quarterfinals of the New Zealand Open at 
Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan had to save two set points in the first-set tiebreaker and then led 
4-1 in the second set, but allowed Derlin to tie, 4-4, before finally taking 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden, No. 5-seeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel 
and eighth-seeded Scott Davis of the United States all joined the unseeded 
Krishnan in the last eight. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson overpowered Briton Jeremy Bates, 6-2, 6-0.

Practicing on the beach proved to be a good way for the top-ranked Kansas 
Jayhawks to prepare for Wednesday night's game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Calloway led seven Kansas players in double figures with 16 points as the 
unbeaten Jayhawks blitzed Miami, 100-73, for their 17th victory of the season. 
They had worked out on a court drawn in the sand after arriving Tuesday in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wylie, who scored 16 points in the first half and 20 in the game, kept 
Miami (4-6) in contention early before Kansas' depth began to take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, averaging 95.4 points going into the game, reached the 100 mark for the 
fifth time. Miami gave up 100 for the first time this season and suffered its 
most lopsided loss. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Pritchard had 14 points for Kansas, which shot 56%. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Missouri 106, Southern 87 -- Even without its coach and two guards, the 
Tigers had too much of everything. They scored the game's first 17 points at 
Columbia, Mo., before coasting to their 14th victory in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart, who missed the team's final 14 games last season 
after he was diagnosed as having colon cancer, was absent because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Ford, who started Missouri's last three games, was hospitalized with a 
strained back, and Lee Coward was benched because of a cracked rib. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith finished with 24 points and 15 rebounds for Missouri. Nathan Buntin 
added 21 points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edison High School easily fended off Huntington Beach, defeating the Oilers, 
86-70, in the Sunset League opener for both teams Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (12-4 overall, 1-0 in Sunset League) led all the way as it shut down 
Huntington Beach (7-8, 0-1) inside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to play catch-up," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller said. "That's 
the one thing we didn't want to do. We're tired of always having to make the 
adjustments. We tried some things . . . I'm disappointed in a couple of the 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach did respond with five three-point baskets, three from Anh 
Duong, a 5-foot-9 guard who came off the bench to lead the Oilers with 17 
points. But the Chargers outshot, outrebounded and simply outran Huntington 
Beach on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing about this team is its balance," Edison Coach Jon Borchert 
said. "We have six players averaging between 6.5 and 14 points a game. If 
someone has an off night, we have other people who can take up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Martineau, Edison's 6-10 center, had an "off" fourth quarter, fouling out 
with 3:43 left to play. But the senior had already scored 21 points and grabbed 
a team-high eight rebounds, as his teammates constantly found him open under 
the Charger basket. His teammate, guard Tom Tyler, scored 20 points, seven on 
free throws, and had six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The real show, however, was Brandon Jessie, Edison's 6-4 guard. Jessie scored a 
game-high 23 points and pulled down six rebounds. But the sophomore got into 
foul trouble in the third quarter, so Borchert took him out with 3:19 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Brandon is a very spectacular athlete," Borchert said. "All he needs is a step 
and he'll come out. But for us to be good, we need solid play from Martineau 
and Tyler. Like any other well coached team, (Huntington Beach) will take what 
they're given." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 77, Fountain Valley 59 -- Ryan Martin scored 19 points to lead Ocean 
View (8-3, 1-0) at Fountain Valley (6-9, 0-1). Greg Evans added 15 points for 
Ocean View and Jim Gwaltney had 14. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 68, Westminster 49 -- Marina's Cherokee Parks had 20 points to lead all 
scorers. Marina is 9-7 overall, 1-0 in league play. Westminster is 6-8, 0-1.

CELTICS TURN IT AROUND, 104-97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In less than 24 hours, the Boston Celtics went from miserable to sensational. 
</P>
<P>
The team that scored only six points in the second quarter of a loss at New 
Jersey Tuesday night, closed with a rush Wednesday night at Boston and beat the 
Detroit Pistons, 104-97. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Celtics' second victory in three games since Larry Bird went out 
with a sprained ankle. Tuesday's loss, especially Boston's two-for-15 shooting 
and seven turnovers in the worst quarter in Celtic history, will not soon be 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Coach Jimmy Rodgers made a single lineup change for the Pistons, who 
had won six in a row, three of them on the road. He shelved the idea of Kevin 
McHale coming off the bench and gave the 6-foot-10 forward his first start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
McHale responded with 30 points and Reggie Lewis had 32. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics led most of the game, but a short bank shot by Bill Laimbeer put 
Detroit ahead, 78-76, with 9:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and McHale took charge, Lewis scoring seven points in the stretch drive 
and McHale keeping the Celtics in front in the closing seconds with two key 
rebounds and four free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"When we play a team like Detroit, the intensity increases," Rodgers said. "We 
have to find the formula for doing it every game." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly gave Lewis the credit for beating his team. "We couldn't 
contain him," he said. "He just made shot after shot." 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics won despite poor shooting (41.1% from the field) because they 
dominated the boards, 53-40. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 120, Chicago 113 -- Former UCLA star Reggie Miller was pretty sure he 
couldn't stop Michael Jordan, but there was a chance he could outscore him. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacer guard scored 15 of his 44 points in the fourth quarter at 
Indianapolis to hold off the Bulls and end Indiana's five-game losing streak. 
Although he was only 13 of 30 from the field, Jordan had 35 points, 12 of them 
in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I love playing Michael," Miller said. "This is something to tell my kids. If 
you can't get psyched up to play Chicago and Michael Jordan, don't bother to 
lace up your shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 113, New York 111 -- Charles Barkley made a 14-foot jump shot with 
2.7 seconds left at Philadelphia to give the 76ers the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks trailed, 109-102, with 1:58 remaining, then scored six points in a 
row. They tied it, 111-111, on Mark Jackson's three-point shot with 15 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks tried to double-team Barkley on the last play, but the powerful 
forward made the shot, finishing with 24 points on nine-of-10 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 130, Denver 99 -- Karl Malone made his first nine shots as the Jazz 
coasted to victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Malone took seven shots in the first quarter and the Jazz built a 38-17 lead on 
the way to its 15th victory in 18 home games. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 46-17 before Denver scored in the second quarter. The Nuggets 
played without Alex English, who has a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 116, Cleveland 100 -- Ricky Pierce had 31 points at Richfield, Ohio, 
and the Bucks broke open the game with a 22-8 burst early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks have won nine of their last 10 and five of their last six on the 
road. They are three games behind Detroit in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 123, Dallas 119 -- Terry Teagle scored 28 points, including four 
free throws in the closing seconds, at Oakland to lead the Warriors to their 
fifth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In a game in which neither team led by more than six points, it was tied, 
117-117, before Teagle made two free throws. After Rolando Blackman's shot was 
blocked by 7-6 Manute Bol, Teagle made two more to put it out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Blackman had made the Mavericks' last seven points to get them even. DAN HAFNER

Rancho Santiago College took its offense outside to take a big early lead and 
ended up with a 96-77 victory over Saddleback Wednesday in an Orange Empire 
Conference basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago made 10 three-pointers in the first half to build a 55-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback made a charge in the second half but could get no close than 11 
points, at 62-51, with 14:16 left to play. At that point, Rancho Santiago Coach 
Dana Pagett asked for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
After the break, Pagett's Dons went on a 12-2 run to take a 74-53 lead. Corie 
Blount had four points and John Guerrero had a three-pointer in the run. 
Saddleback was never closer than 15 points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago, the second-ranked team in the state, is 19-1 and 2-0 in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight I thought we played well in the first half like we did earlier in the 
season," Pagett said. "We dropped down a little in the second half, though." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Altamirano (14 points) and John Guerrero (16) led Rancho Santiago's 
three-point barrage with four each. Eric Kutas came off the bench to lend 
outside support as well with three. Alvin Loftis had the Dons' other 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The team was 10 of 12 in the first half and 12 of 20 in the game on three-point 
attempts. Saddleback extended its zone past the three-point line in the second 
half to cut down Rancho Santiago's percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Lien, Rancho Santiago's center, added 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's second-half rally was led by Terrell Malone and Greg Reynolds. 
Malone had 10 of his game-high 26 points in the second half before fouling out 
with 4:03 left. Reynolds scored 14 of his 16 points in the second half for 
Saddleback (7-12, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's Charles Lockard, the team's leading scorer, had eight points 
before leaving with the flu midway in the first half. 
</P>

bench to lead Saddleback (11-9, 2-1) at home. McKee scored a career-high 19 
points and Hellewell had a team-high seven rebounds to go with 15 points. 
Saddleback was without leading scorer Kristen Okura, who injured her knee last 
Friday in a game against Riverside. She is expected to be out at least a week.

scorer, Calvin Coleman, to just four points. Mark Tague led Carlsbad (4-8, 1-1)

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CHULA VISTA KEEPS PACE WITH SWEETWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Conlin is in his first year as boys' basketball coach at Bonita Vista. But 
he is being taught the nuances of the Metro Conference early and rudely. 
</P>
<P>
In a match-up of undefeated Metro teams Wednesday night, host Chula Vista 
defeated Bonita Vista, 77-71. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 73-71, Bonita Vista had a chance to tie or take the lead with fewer 
than 10 seconds left, but Chula Vista's Carnell Penn wrested the ball from Rope 
Perry at the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
Penn then hit Trenell Hicks for a fast-break layup that was ruled good after a 
goaltending call on Perry. A technical foul called on the Bonita Vista bench 
resulted in the final two points, free throws by Penn with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory left Chula Vista (13-4, 4-0) and No. 2 Sweetwater (15-1, 4-0) as 
the leaders in the Metro title race. Bonita Vista fell to 8-5, 4-1 and 
essentially -- barring upsets -- faces a situation of having to defeat 
Sweetwater twice for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the game that would decide who is going to challenge Sweetwater," 
Conlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Collins, Chula Vista's coach of 18 years, says any victory in the league 
is big. But his players are looking forward to a week from Friday, when they 
visit Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we know we're one step up in the Metro," Hicks said. "We know we're going 
to have to play Sweetwater for the championship." 
</P>
<P>
After Bonita Vista scored 10 consecutive points and took a 63-62 lead moments 
into the fourth quarter, Penn, who had a team-high 25 points, took charge and 
scored Chula Vista's next six. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista's Allen McNamee (20 points) hit his third three-pointer and made a 
pair of free throws, and Penn made two of his own to tie it at 71-71 with 2:57 
left. Daniel Johnson's five-foot bank shot made it 73-71. 
</P>
<P>
It remained there until Bonita Vista rebounded a missed Spartan free throw and 
tried to set it up for Perry, a 6-foot-5 junior who had 25 points and seven 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big player for them," Penn said. "He's the guy they want to shoot that 
last shot. I just stuck my hand in and knocked the ball away." JIM LINDGREN

Orion Pictures Corp.: The motion picture company said third-quarter net income 
rose 46% from a year ago to $1.7 million. Revenue totaled $104 million, up 
almost 13%. The New York-based firm said the improved earnings were due in part 
to the emergence of basic cable networks as licensees of feature films.

MAGAZINES: LAMPOON'S NEW LAUGH TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's funny? A drive-in theater sign reading, inexplicably, "Loose Coeds for 
Sale"? How about a fake advertisement for Rolling Stone magazine with a 
photograph of publisher Jann Wenner just after he has gnawed the head off a 
live chicken? 
</P>
<P>
If a magazine could nail down America's sense of humor, it would laugh all the 
way to the bank. But comedic tastes are the toughest to define. Which may 
explain why, as one magazine puts it in its ads, "You can count the number of 
humor publications on the fingers of one hand. Even if you've lost several 
fingers to a garbage disposal or a microwave oven." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine in that ad is National Lampoon; the humor -- or alleged humor -- 
cited above appears in its February issue. 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of the 100-year-old Harvard Lampoon, the National Lampoon turns 20 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't look a day over 15. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, the Lampoon -- with enough peculiar contributors to fill an 
asylum, including John Hughes, P. J. O'Rourke and Michael Donahue -- was as 
much a fixture in dorm rooms as the bong and the stereo. Then it seemed to go 
the way of bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, however, a couple of boom babies named Tim Matheson and Dan 
Grodnik managed to swing a takeover of the Lampoon company and get their names 
implanted atop the National Lampoon's masthead as co-CEOs. 
</P>
<P>
Matheson was a child actor ("Leave It to Beaver," "Bonanza," "My Three Sons") 
who got his big post-puberty break in National Lampoon's infamous film, "Animal 
House." Grodnik, 36, wrote and produced such films as "Terror Train" and a Hulk 
Hogan vehicle, "Goldi and the Bears." 
</P>
<P>
Both grew up on the Lampoon's involuntary, sneak-up-from behind, 
beer-expelled-through-the-nose humor. But like many in their generation, they 
drifted away from the collegiate mirth magazine as they grew older. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're intent on turning the Lampoon into nothing less than "The American 
forum for humor." 
</P>
<P>
Clinging to the shirttails of the film "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," 
which stars Chevy Chase, the magazine is doing better than it has in a long 
time in subscriptions and advertising. But it has a long way to go before 
becoming America's anything (even if Matheson and Grodnik can figure out which 
America they're talking about). 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year into their stewardship, the magazine still seems tired. The 
February issue, for instance, is billed "Welcome to the Nineties," and features 
a satirical piece about a Japanese takeover of America. But the issue, like 
many past issues, is mired in the '60s. One page, for example, shows a dozen 
pictures of Dick Clark modeling hair styles of rock stars; the most happening 
star featured is Sex Pistol Sid Vicious, who has been dead for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Grodnik says not to worry. By the time the Sept. 20 anniversary issue hits the 
stands, things will change and the magazine again will become "smart and funny 
and hopefully hip." They plan to bring in new talent and to re-establish 
themselves on college campuses, drawing funny folks as interns from Harvard, 
Stanford and other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lampoon, as Grodnik describes it, will position itself somewhere between Mad 
magazine, which appeals to pimply faced sixth-grade suburban comedy rebels, and 
Spy, which is read by acne-scarred rebels who moved to Manhattan and became 
filthy rich, elitist humor snobs. 
</P>
<P>
"National Lampoon should reflect current values in our country and allow us to 
look at them in a humorous way," Grodnik said. "The mandate is, if it's funny 
it goes in the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
But what's funny? Not naked women. 
</P>
<P>
"When we took over this magazine, they had ads in it that were off-color. We're 
not looking to put out a salacious magazine," Grodnik said. On the other hand, 
"This isn't the Christian Science Monitor. Everything doesn't have to be 
tasteful. It just has to be funny." 
</P>
<P>
The new owners have searched for just the right editor, "an editor with vision 
and entrepreneurial spirit," Grodnik says. He won't name names but says several 
California editorial hot-shots have stepped forward to fill the role -- only to 
retreat "because they didn't have the courage." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Larry (Ratso) Sloman, the Lampoon's current executive editor, is, 
for the most part, happy about the changes foreseen. As for the controversy 
about "salacious" layouts, he said: "Oh, we'll still have those kinds of photo 
shoots. . . . It's just that they won't appear in the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dismal Science' Makes Interesting Reading 
</P>
<P>
The January Atlantic devotes its cover to Lester Thurow, "probably the most 
famous economist in America who has not been the host of a PBS television 
series." It's one article on the "dismal science" that is not dismal reading. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Thurow's colleagues dismiss him with the nickname "Less Than Thorough" 
because he generally prefers to air his economic concerns in public rather than 
in scholarly forums. As portrayed by Atlantic writer Charles C. Mann, he is "a 
man of action rather than a doodler with equations, he rides on newspapers and 
magazines to America's homes, yelling out his warning in orthodox Paul Revere 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The essence of his warning is that America may be transforming from a rich into 
a poor nation. There are many reasons for this and many solutions in Thurow's 
analysis, but at the heart of the matter is the elitist class that has ruled 
and will continue to rule this country. 
</P>
<P>
Thurow defines these moneyed, privileged, well-connected folks with two labels: 
the Oligarchy and the Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, in his estimation, is that an Establishment is truly interested 
in the nation's long-term success and "personally confident that if my country 
succeeds, I will succeed." On the other hand, "an oligarchy is intrinsically 
insecure and has got to have secret Swiss bank accounts, because they're sure 
that the world is going to fall apart tomorrow and they won't get their share." 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. wobbles between these types of ruling classes, Thurow believes. The 
Founding Fathers were Establishment; the ruling class of the '80s -- he names 
Donald Trump and Michael Milken, for instance -- were an oligarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The big question facing America now, Thurow argues, is which group will take 
charge in the 1990s as the nation faces its most difficult economic dilemma to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The Establishment, as Thurow defines it, will help the country change to meet 
the challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"An oligarchy," he says, "Will pull the country down with it."

 Hotel Queen's Counsel: Leona Helmsley has hired Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard 
law professor who helped clear Claus von Bulow of attempted murder, to handle 
the appeal of her tax evasion conviction. Dershowitz says Helmsley's image as a 
tempestuous shrew is undeserved. 
</P>

Helmsley, 69, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million for 
cheating on her taxes.

Hit List: LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and Kim Basinger led Mr. 
Blackwell's 30th annual list of worst-dressed celebrities Wednesday. The 
acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at Princess Anne, Emily 
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and gave a shared dishonor to Madonna 
and Sandra Bernhard. Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will 
be the "Cher for the '90s" who is "more fashion freak than biker chic . . . in 
leather and chains," said Blackwell. Television's Barr was zinged as a "bowling 
alley reject" and Batman's Basinger was a "parading peep-show (who) should be 
banished to the bat cave."

The Eagle Flies: Quarterback Randall Cunningham didn't get his Philadelphia 
Eagles to the Super Bowl but members of one church think he's super. He stunned 
them by showing up at Sunday services with a $100,000 donation for the 
500-member church. "They were rejoicing," said Elva Smith, of St. John Baptist 
Church in east Camden, N.J. Cunningham isn't a member of the church but has 
attended often. The church will use the money for construction and a local 
outreach program.

JACK SMITH: MUCH NOISY ADO ABOUT SYMBOLISM OF LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the holidays, I reported a complaint from Avalee Nicholls of Coronado 
that she had read the phrase "sounding brass and tinkling symbols" in George 
Will's column in the San Diego Union. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls said she called the paper to point out that "symbols" should have been 
"cymbals," and an editor said, "That's George Will who wrote that and I don't 
presume to correct George Will." 
</P>
<P>
A prudent position indeed. As I said, "Far be it from me, also, to correct 
George Will, but I would have thought that cymbals clanged and bells tinkled." 
</P>
<P>
Then I began worrying about it. Will is perhaps the most erudite of political 
columnists. He is not careless. His columns are illuminated with exquisitely 
apposite quotations. One suspects that he has an employee who does nothing but 
look them up, as Gary Trudeau suggested in a series of Doonesbury strips. 
</P>
<P>
I thought it unlikely that Will would unthinkingly use the homophone symbols 
for cymbals. I suspected that it was a pun. But I didn't have the text. I 
phoned my friend Neil Morgan, editor of the San Diego Tribune, to see if he 
could ask his library to find the column. He said it might be difficult, with 
only the words "sounding brass" and "tinkling symbols" to find in the data 
base. He gave me Will's Washington telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, his secretary put me through to him. I asked him about using 
"tinkling symbols," and spelled it for him. "I might have done it," he said. 
"I'm dumb enough." 
</P>
<P>
Of course we know Will isn't dumb. His style and his learning are galvanizing. 
I told him I had guessed that he had used symbols as a pun. He said he doubted 
it. "I don't like puns." 
</P>
<P>
Then I began receiving letters pointing out that Will was quoting the Bible. 
You can't get on any firmer ground than the Bible. Dorothy M. Heitmiller and 
several other readers noted that the quote was from the King James translation 
of 1 Corinthians 13:1: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, 
and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal." 
</P>
<P>
Heitmiller further pointed out that in the Revised Standard edition, the 
instruments had been changed to "a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal," and in the 
New King James version "sounding brass or a clanging cymbal." 
</P>
<P>
My friend Chuck Chappell wrote that he just happened to be looking through the 
International Bible Dictionary and "unexpectedly found support for your 
position," to wit: "In Corinthians 13.1 the apostle (Paul) deduces a comparison 
from sounding brass and 'tinkling cymbals'; perhaps the latter words had been 
better rendered 'clanging' or 'clattering cymbals' since such is the nature of 
the instrument." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, my Scofield reference Bible (authorized King James version, revised), 
reads: "Although I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not 
love, I am become as sounding bronze, or a tinkling cymbal." 
</P>
<P>
This may seem like much ado about nothing (Shakespeare), but I felt obliged to 
confess that I did not recognize the biblical verse, and to reinforce my doubt 
that Will used symbols without a literary reason. 
</P>
<P>
What prompted this research was a discussion here of homophones (words that 
sound alike but have different spellings, origins and meanings) and their 
cousins. I should note that Avalee Nicholls, in reporting the editor's refusal 
to second-guess George Will's symbols, concluded thus: "His editor didn't 
dessert him in his thyme of knead." 
</P>
<P>
Fred A. Glienna says I forget to mention contranyms (his word?) -- alike words 
that have opposite meanings: "The farmer dusted his crops while his wife dusted 
the furniture. . . . Cleave to my side, and don't cleave my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Goldschmidt, UCLA professor emeritus, anthropology, also remarks on the 
contranym, mentioning cleave and oversight, a word whose opposite meanings 
first dawned on him when he heard about a Congressional Committee on Oversight. 
</P>
<P>
An English professor called cleave to his attention, he says, observing that 
"when the Bible enjoins us to cleave unto our wives it is not giving us license 
to go at them with a cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
OK, Will. If you can do it, I can do it: Gen. 2:24: "Therefore shall a man 
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall 
be one flesh."

MISS MANNERS: DIET IS PERSONAL MATTER -- SO THERE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- While my husband and I are not Orthodox Jews, we find many 
Jewish customs and rituals personally meaningful. For this reason, we abstain 
from eating pork products and shellfish, and we do not consume meat and dairy 
products at the same meal. In our own home or with close friends (even 
non-Jewish friends), this is not considered unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes when we have attended social events where things we do not eat were 
served, there have been problems. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if we would care to partake of the baked ham, beef stroganoff, 
barbecued shrimp, oysters in bacon or other excluded foods, we try to refuse 
politely. I always thought that saying, "No, thank you," or "Really, I don't 
care for any," in a polite and friendly tone, would be sufficient indication 
that we really don't want to eat that particular dish. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, we have run into a type of host or fellow guest who insists 
that we simply must try some. At this juncture, I usually say that we have 
personal reasons for refusing. This is where the going gets really ugly. 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, an explanation has been demanded, which the host or 
fellow guest proceeded to ridicule. We have been told that we are living in the 
Dark Ages, that we are depriving our children of proper nutrition, and that we 
are upholding ignorant superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
Is it now acceptable for hosts to berate their guests in this way, or for 
guests to berate other guests? Should my husband and I be prepared to defend 
our choices? Or should we simply not accept any more invitations? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- As you well know, insulting other people's religious 
practices, embarrassing guests and monitoring other people's eating habits and 
child-rearing practices are all intensely rude, and always will be. Checking up 
on what other people eat and don't eat has indeed become common, but that does 
nothing to excuse it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miss Manners doesn't want you to have to give up social life in order 
to avoid this. Just refuse to enter into any such discussions. A small amount 
of indignation -- not enough to start a fight, just enough to discourage people 
from pushing you -- is in order. 
</P>
<P>
When you declare it is a personal matter, do so with conversation-ending 
firmness. Further questions should be answered by repeating the statement ("I 
believe I said it is a personal matter") and rude comments should be denounced 
with an amazed, "I beg your pardon!" 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- When a waitress asks "How is everything?" aren't we 
supposed to answer truthfully? 
</P>
<P>
I recently told a waitress the prime rib was awful and I just couldn't eat it. 
She said, "I'm sorry." I replied, "It's not your fault," and proceeded to eat 
my salad and potato only. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, the owner of the restaurant (a fine supper club) came 
to our table and said: "Do we have a problem here? I heard you don't like our 
prime. I cooked it myself. My family and I ate it. There's nothing wrong with 
it, and I think you owe the waitress an apology. She feels so intimidated by 
you that she won't even come back to your table." 
</P>
<P>
I said nothing further. Shortly thereafter I paid my entire bill and left, 
vowing to never return. I was very upset about being yelled at just because I 
told the truth about the meat. Some of my friends thought the owner should have 
offered something else or reduced the tab because I did not eat the meat. 
</P>
<P>
What should I have said? "It's OK" -- just to please the waitress and the 
owner? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Not only the prime rib, but everyone in this unfortunate 
anecdote seems to be unfit to be in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
A shrewd -- to say nothing of polite -- restaurateur not only would have 
refrained from yelling at a customer but would have seen to it that the 
customer did not go away unsatisfied. Canceling the bill or substituting an 
acceptable meal are two ways of doing this. 
</P>
<P>
A good waitress would have alerted the owner to the problem rather than going 
emotionally to pieces, which seems excessive, even to gentle Miss Manners. 
</P>
<P>
But you were being inappropriately humble. If the food was truly inedible -- 
not if you changed your mind about what you wanted to order -- you should have 
politely called it to the waitress's attention before she asked. Insisting on 
value for money is not rude, provided it is not rudely done. For this reason, 
Miss Manners has always believed "Is everything all right?" to be a silly 
question. But this does not entitle the askers to be guaranteed silly answers.

YOUR COINS: QUARTER EAGLE MAY BE WORTH A LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently received an 1856 $2 1/2 gold coin. It has a Liberty head 
and is in very good condition. Could you let me know how much this coin may be 
worth? -- W.J.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: On the surface, the answer is quite simple. Your quarter eagle is worth 
$200 and up, depending upon condition. But it's more complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
Quarter eagles, an interesting denomination, were minted from 1796 to 1929. 
This distinguished series not only has many dates, but there were also many 
design changes plus different varieties within the types. In addition, the coin 
was produced at different mints. Your coin, issued shortly before the outbreak 
of the Civil War, not only came from the Philadelphia Mint, which was the 
workhorse of the day, but also from some branch mints. It is the coins from the 
branch mints that carry the extra premium because of their low mintages. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, the Philadelphia Mint (no mint mark) produced 384,240 $2 1/2 
gold pieces in 1856. But the Charlotte (N.C.) Mint (a C mint mark) produced 
only 7,913 of these coins, the Dahlonega (Ga.) Mint (D mint mark) produced 874, 
the New Orleans Mint (0 mint mark) issued 21,100 and the San Francisco Mint (S 
mint mark) made 72,120. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, the lower mintages from the branch mints make those coins more 
valuable, providing the condition is equal. So, while the basic price is about 
$200, yours could be worth considerably more. Look for a mint mark on the 
reverse, just above the 2 1/2 D. If you find a C or D, congratulations. You're 
in the money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: After my brother's death, we found nine 10- and 20-mark gold pieces, 
Deutsches Reich, dated 1872, 1888, 1894, 1895 and 1893. The coins are in good 
shape. What are they worth? -- H.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your German coins are essentially bullion pieces. The 10 marks are worth 
about $75 each; the 20 marks are in the $95 to $110 range each.

PROBING THE SOUL OF LATIN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARITA NIETO, Nieto recently published the catalogue essay for the 
exhibition Le Demon des Anges: 19 Artistes Chicanos Autour de Los Angeles, 
which opened in Nantes, France, in May, and which will be traveling throughout

Interviews With Latin American Writers by Marie-Lise Gazarian Gautier (The 
Dalkey Archive Press: $19.95; 370 pp. 
</P>
<P>
As interview subjects, Latin American writers have appeared in the print and 
electronic media since the literary "boom" of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Heirs to an intellectual tradition that associates the act of writing with 
political and social responsibility, poets and novelists such as Octavio Paz, 
Carlos Fuentes and Ariel Dorfman are also recognized as journalists and 
commentators. Their voices and views, as well as those of other Latin American 
writers, have never been limited to their fictional and poetic work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, because of their participation in politics, public opinion and even 
films, they form part of a larger narrative -- the recording and documentation 
of our historical time and place. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is a candidate for president of Peru, poet Ernesto 
Cardenal is a cabinet member of the Sandinista government of Nicaragua; 
novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a founder of a Latin American film institute 
in Havana. Ripe interview material indeed, for the intrigues and events 
experienced by these writers in the world beyond the mythical Ivory Tower at 
times surpass their imagined fictions. 
</P>
<P>
While only two of the above-mentioned writers are interviewed in this new 
collection (Fuentes and Vargas Llosa), that sense of commitment toward social 
responsibility is not only stated, but clarified within the personal 
circumstances of each writer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 interviews -- which include Isabel Allende, Guillermo Cabrera 
Infante Jose Donoso, Rosario Ferre, Isaac Goldenberg, Juan Carlos Onetti, 
Nicanor Parra, Elena Poniatowska, Ernesto Sabato, Luis Rafael Sanchez, Severo 
Sarduy, Luisa Valenzuela, as well as those mentioned above -- that commitment 
goes far beyond a creative or intellectual game. Devoid of patriotic or 
rhetorical adornment, it becomes instead a deadly objective particularly well 
expressed by Allende and Cabrera Infante, who were forced to leave their 
respective countries because of reprisal, repression and censorship. 
</P>
<P>
While this issue is probably the most important in all, Marie-Lise Gazarian 
Gautier, a professor of Spanish and Latin American literature, also includes 
topics as far-ranging as the role of the woman writer in a male-dominant 
society, the relationships perceived by each author between Anglo America (the 
United States) and Latin America, the effect of exile and self-exile on writing 
and the question of Latin American identity on the eve of the 400th 
commemoration of Columbus' voyage. Each interview closes with a call for 
self-definition: "Who are you?" 
</P>
<P>
Of these, however, the issue of exile beyond the points already raised and its 
diverse implications on the act of writing are particularly intriguing. How 
does distance from the source affect the world of the work? How does a writer 
continue to find a linguistic and semantic link between the space where he or 
she is today and the place of origin? What meaning does that have in terms of 
the constant reworking of a language and of its process? How is the reading of 
the work affected? Is the work circulated in the homeland? 
</P>
<P>
Yet the responses of the writers chosen for this collection only partially 
answer these questions or others that arise during the reading of this book. 
The problem lies in the structure of the work itself, in the tone that the 
interviewer conveys, and, to a lesser degree, in the omission of writers of the 
stature of Paz and Garcia Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
In her introduction, Gazarian Gautier refers to the interview as a "revealing 
and authentic approach to literature" in that it "allows the reader to 
penetrate the creative mind and find out first-hand . . . the components of the 
craft of writing and the workings of the author." 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, that is accomplished. This book is an excellent introduction to 
the personalities and personae behind the works and the device of using the 
same or similar questions for each writer permits the reader to compare and 
contrast the writers' responses. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this format also cuts off the flow of thought emanating from 
the writer and instead focuses the interview on the prepared question. By 
attempting to extract information or commentary that Gazarian Gautier thinks 
important, she loses the essence of continuity that allows for dialogue. What 
we have before us finally is a question-and-answer format. What is absent is 
the interplay between voice and silence based on listening and communication. 
</P>
<P>
In her interview with Elena Poniatowska, Gazarian Gautier recalls that 
Poniatowska, an insightful interviewer in her own right, has been called an 
"inquisitor, a confessor, a psychiatrist, a torturer and an adviser to the 
lovelorn, all at the same time." In response, Poniatowska avoids the question, 
referring instead to the friendships that she had developed through the course 
of conducting her interviews. 
</P>
<P>
It is a point worth noting, for the great interview has always forged a link 
between two voices: We need only recall those of Luigi Barzini, Oriana Falacci 
and Poniatowska. And that is what is lacking here, the intimacy and confidence 
born of a mutual conversation, the ebb and flow of ideas between two minds, the 
essence, after all, of dialogue and dialectic.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: AFFAIRS ONLY CREATE STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm a married man with two children, ages 9 and 14. Although 
I still love my wife and certainly don't want to destroy my marriage and 
family, I'm very attracted to a young woman I met. I'm contemplating having an 
affair with her, but I'm not sure that I could stand the stress of constantly 
having to lie to my wife and children. -- G.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.F.: Extramarital affairs bring enormous stress on every member of the 
family, even if by some miracle the facts are never brought out into the open. 
Studies show that children of all ages suffer and that there is a profound 
impact. Children are quick to sense that a parent is expending emotional energy 
outside the family. They're apt to feel left out and rejected even though they 
don't know what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say girls who become aware of fathers' affairs seem to grow up 
angry at men and unsure of relations with them, while boys, even though they're 
extremely hurt and angry at the time, may eventually grow up to repeat the 
pattern of infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't unusual to be attracted to someone other than our spouses, but this 
doesn't mean that we act out that attraction. The difference between sexual and 
emotional maturity and immaturity is reflected in how we respond to such 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: One of my 12-year-old daughter's closest friends is in real 
trouble at home. Her mother is deeply into drugs and I suspect she's supporting 
her habit by prostitution. I think both my daughter and her friend are aware of 
this, although they haven't mentioned it directly. What should I do, if 
anything? -- W.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR W.T.: Try to initiate a discussion by asking your daughter if her friend 
is having difficulties at home. If you are sympathetic and understanding, your 
daughter may open up and tell you what she knows. Make sure you emphasize to 
her that what this child's mother does is not a reflection on the girl herself, 
and that if you really like and trust a friend you stand by them. 
</P>
<P>
If you admire this young girl, why not suggest that she'd be welcome to spend 
some nights at your house if she wanted to and if her mother has no objections? 
You can do this without embarrassing the girl and without directly discussing 
her mother's problem, if you see that the youngster doesn't want to share this. 
Eventually, she may be confident enough of your support to be honest with you 
and even ask for your help. 
</P>
<P>
If your suspicions are correct, this child may have to be in some kind of 
foster care. She may even need legal help. Above all, don't desert her, and 
reassure your daughter that trouble is a time for friends.

ANN LANDERS: OUT OF STEP ON THE DANCE FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN LANDERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR ANN: My wife is a terrific person. She excels in almost everything. Her 
one area of deficiency is ballroom dancing. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not bragging when I say I'm an excellent dancer. Women often ask me to 
dance with them. But I cannot dance with my wife. "Charlotte" holds her head in 
the wrong position and her left arm is like a 10-ton weight on my right 
shoulder. Good dancers glide along, taking horizontal steps. Charlotte prefers 
to do her own thing. Instead of following me, she leads. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. When I told Charlotte I was writing to you for help, I was relieved to 
find that she was not at all upset. -- MR. FOX TROT, Highland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MR. TROT: I hope you won't be upset to learn that Charlotte wrote to me, 
too. Here is her letter: 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANN: My husband is a wonderful man in all respects except one. Whenever we 
go dancing he ends up mad because he doesn't like the way I dance. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoy dancing but I don't take it as seriously as my husband does. He insists 
on giving me lessons, tells me how to hold my head, what to do with my arms, do 
this, don't do that. It takes all the fun out of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
I have danced with many men through the years, and no one has ever complained. 
In fact, I've been told that I'm a good dancer. But whenever my husband and I 
dance together we end up arguing. 
</P>
<P>
I love this man dearly and would appreciate any suggestions you might have on 
how to solve this problem. It really has caused a lot of trouble in our 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TWO LEFT FEET? 
</P>
<P>
DEAR FEET: You two need an impartial third party to mediate this small war. I 
suggest a dance instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Take a few lessons together and let the instructor decide where your arms 
should be and how you should hold your head. Since the inability to dance 
together seems to be causing so much trouble in your marriage, lessons would be 
well worth the time and money. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANN: My problem is my son. "Bruce" weighs at least 350 pounds and is 
headed for 400. He keeps getting fatter and fatter, although he knows I 
desperately want him to get down to normal weight. He doesn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
I sent Bruce to the very best schools and he is highly intelligent. He seems to 
be doing OK professionally, but in his line of work looks count, and I'm sure 
he could do a lot better if he lost 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
I have two other sons who are in good physical condition. Tell me if there is 
anything that can be done to bring Bruce to his senses before the heart attack 
comes. Sign me . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- DISTURBED MOTHER SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MOTHER: I can understand your concern, but take my word for it, Mother, 
losing weight is the original do-it-yourself project. 
</P>
<P>
Begging, nagging or threatening will not work. Unless Bruce decides of his own 
volition to get serious, nothing will happen, even though his obesity is 
life-threatening. He needs counseling to find out why he is doing this to 
himself -- and perhaps to you. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not what Bruce is eating but what is eating him. I wish him the 
best of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonesome? Take charge of your life and turn it around. Write for Ann Landers' 
new booklet, "How to Make Friends and Stop Being Lonely." Send a 
self-addressed, business-size envelope and a check or money order for $4.15 
(this includes postage and handling) to: Friends, c/o Ann Landers, P.O. Box 
11562, Chicago, Ill. 60611-0562. (In Canada send $5.05.)

American Choreographer in Beijing: An American is choreographing a Chinese 
ballet in one of the first such cultural exchanges since China's military 
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in June. Norman Walker, who teaches 
dance at Adelphi University in New York and has choreographed more than 150 
dances, said that the romantic score he composed for the Central Ballet of 
China depicts a "natural growth in human affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said the ballet, based on Chinese composer Liu Dunnan's piano concerto 
"The Mountain Forest," attempts movements different from the rest of the 
Central Ballet's repertoire "so as to expand their potential." The ballet, 
based on an exchange planned before June, will open next Thursday in Beijing 
and feature 11 couples from the national troupe. DANIEL CERONE

'Miss Saigon' Seeks Broadway Home: The London musical "Miss Saigon" is expected 
to be the next big blockbuster on Broadway, but it may not get there until the 
spring of 1991 or later. The show, a modern "Madama Butterfly" that tells the 
story of the last days of American involvement in the Vietnam War, was supposed 
to get to New York this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Following the smash success of his "Phantom of the Opera," producer Cameron 
Mackintosh is having trouble finding a theater big enough to house his next 
grand production, which includes a 40-member cast and a dramatic helicopter 
landing scene. Mackintosh refuses to take any shortcuts. "I'm not going to put 
'Miss Saigon' on in New York in any less of a way than it is appearing in 
London," he said. The show is estimated to cost $9 million, which would make it 
the most expensive in Broadway history.

Corday Exits CBS: CBS Entertainment executive Barbara Corday, former head of 
Columbia Pictures Television and co-creator of "Cagney &amp; Lacey," will leave 
CBS. The announcement from the network, which is struggling to get out of the 
ratings cellar, said simply: "After cordial discussions, CBS and Barbara Corday

CARROLL OFFERS GRACEFUL SET AT WESTWOOD MARQUIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Carroll, who opened a six-week engagement Tuesday at the Westwood 
Marquis, has credits as a pianist that go back to the 52nd Street era. In those 
days, she was strictly a be-bopper, probably the first woman to embrace the new 
movement of that time. 
</P>
<P>
She has since settled into a more conservative style in which grace and 
delicacy have taken over where energy and drive once dominated. Harmonically, 
however, she has developed to the point where she can bring out all the 
richness of a Gershwin or Sondheim melody. 
</P>
<P>
Three numbers into the set she began singing. The balance of her show was 
divided about equally between vocals and instrumentals. Carroll lays no claim 
to her mastery as a singer. If she has a vibrato it is imperceptible, since she 
never holds on to a note long enough to need one. Yet her treatment of the 
antic humor in "I Wish I Were in Love Again" managed to fit the material 
perfectly. Her attempt to sing a Billie Holiday blues was entirely too dainty. 
</P>
<P>
That Carroll is a talented composer came to light late in the set, when she 
offered a touching waltz, "Too Soon," in tribute to the late Bill Evans. More 
original pieces along these lines, and fewer like the dull Cy Coleman songs 
from the new Broadway show "City of Angels," would be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
So too would a bass player. Though she prefers to work alone, there can be 
little doubt that a strong bassist would help immeasurably in bringing to 
Carroll's performance a swinging essence that was not too often noticeable. The 
loneliness of the long-distance pianist was never more obvious than in the 
final number, "Cute," with all those empty breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, just as she has found a perfect niche in her regular job at the 
Carlyle Hotel in New York, Carroll seems well attuned to the requirements of 
the Westwood Marquis. Her opening night attracted some of the same patrons who 
have heard her on Manhattan's East Side, and who are clearly charmed by her 
unpretentiously pleasant delivery. 
</P>
<P>
She will be at the Marquis Tuesdays through Saturdays. LEONARD FEATHER

ABOUT WINE: ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY TASTE TESTING OF LATOUR, THE 'DALLAS COWBOYS OF 
WINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the long history of Bordeaux, one property stands out as a beacon of the 
region, a chateau so well known that its very name prompts wine lovers to 
swoon. 
</P>
<P>
It is Chateau Latour and it is a property with a long, regal and in some ways 
mystifyingly low-key image. The wine of Latour is deep and brooding, intensely 
flavored and hard to evaluate when young because of the richness and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, almost no house in all of Bordeaux has such an amazing track record 
for producing fine wine even in the worst of vintages as has Latour. And thus 
when Riverside wine lover Bipin Desai recently sent out invitations to a 
once-in-a-century tasting of a range of Latours dating back into the 1800s, the 
response was quick. 
</P>
<P>
Held at three Los Angeles restaurants and spanning two dinners and a luncheon, 
Desai's amazing event attracted wine lovers from afar, and clearly this was due 
to the reputation of the chateau for making great wine, year in and out. 
</P>
<P>
At this point it is appropriate to point out that Latour, being one of the 
famed First Growth Bordeaux houses of France, gained its fame in part, 
ironically, by the greatness of the other First Growth wines, and from Latour's 
comparison with them. Were it not for the brilliance in Chateaux 
Mouton-Rothschild, Lafite-Rothschild, Margaux and Haut-Brion, Latour would have 
nothing to which it might be compared and for which it is renowned. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Latour is highly praised in part because it is among the 
darkest, deepest, most concentrated wines on the planet that still has the 
ability to charm the pants off you. Its First Growth cousins have their own 
attributes, and each has its champions, but Latour is sort of the Dallas 
Cowboys of the wine game: even in an off-year its fans love 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Latour is often compared with Lafite, its neighbor in Pauillac, in terms of 
quality. And comparing them is a sport unto itself. For my money, it was best 
stated by Hugh Johnson, the lyric author of dozens of wine books, who compared 
the properties in his Modern Encyclopedia of Wine. The text is poetry of a high 
level: 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of each is set in relief by the very different qualities of the 
other. Lafite is a tenor; Latour a bass . . . Lafite is a dance; Latour a 
parade." 
</P>
<P>
I was unable to attend Desai's Latour extravaganza, with wines dating back more 
than 120 years, though I did taste a few of the youngest wines. But I 
interviewed Alan Hare, president of Latour, and Christian Le Sommer, Latour's 
wine maker, before the event and their comments about Latour give a perspective 
on the property. 
</P>
<P>
And one key element is the relatively greater consistency in the wines of 
Latour over the last 20 years compared with wines made between the 1930s and 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a byword it is consistency," said Hare, acknowledging that that 
word was not always used to describe Latour during that earlier four-decade 
period. 
</P>
<P>
A British firm acquired Latour in 1963 after it had fallen into disrepair, and 
Hare said when the company, Pearson Group, took it over, "50% of the vines were 
dead," and the wine making facility hadn't been renovated in ages. 
</P>
<P>
There is a marvelous (perhaps apocryphal) tale that Harry Waugh, former 
director of Latour, likes to tell about the sale of Latour by the de Beaumont 
family, owners for nearly 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
Waugh says that British banker-financier Lord Cowdray was told by his staff 
that Latour was for sale and could be a good purchase. After investigating and 
seeing the investment potential, Cowdray, apparently a lover of spirits, is 
reported to have said, "I'll buy the place as long as I don't have to drink the 
bloody stuff." 
</P>
<P>
That sale benefited Latour, France and all wine lovers because the new owners 
began to modernize the place, and Hare pointed out, "We have made a big 
investment over the last 20 years." Le Sommer added that much of the 
improvement in Latour has come in the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the depth of this wine, in addition to the familiar arguments 
that quality and style are due mostly to soil and climate, is that the chateau 
uses two methods to limit the size of production (to no more than 25,000 cases 
a year, often less). 
</P>
<P>
One technique is simply not harvesting all the grapes that French law permits. 
Hare said, moreover, that Latour has reduced even the crop it was harvesting 
between 1970 and 1980, when the house produced some awfully good wine. 
</P>
<P>
The second technique came about as a result of the massive replanting job that 
faced Pearson in the 1960s. In an effort to maximize the land that has always 
been Latour, the managers located two parcels that are not in the center of the 
property, but which grow grapes that have essentially the same characteristics 
as the primary land. 
</P>
<P>
The two remote parcels produce some excellent lots of wine, said Le Sommer, but 
the quality is simply a tad low for inclusion most years into Latour. So in 
1966 a "second wine" was made for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Les Forts de Latour, with a label quite similar to Latour itself, is made from 
grapes off the remote plots as well as from vats of Latour wine deemed not to 
be of Grand Vin status, which generally is from vines that are less than 10 
years old. And, said Hare, Les Forts de Latour is not sold the same way most 
other chateaux second wines are sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to keep it in the bottle long enough, to make sure it is not drunk too 
young," he said. The 1966 wine wasn't released until 1970, about a year or two 
after most of the other second wines of the top chateaux, and the 1983 is the 
current release, with the '84 to be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
Hare admitted, "We haven't been doing a good enough job" of promoting Les Forts 
de Latour, though it usually represents excellent quality at a most reasonable 
price. I have a few bottles left of the 1970 Les Forts de Latour that is 
absolutely wonderful wine, and Desai noted recently that the 1966 Les Forts is 
one of the best wines of the vintage, rivaling Latour itself. 
</P>
<P>
Desai's three-meal tasting event was not the first time a so-called "vertical 
tasting" of Latour has been staged. English author Edmund Penning-Rowsell wrote 
in his book "Bordeaux" of many he has attended. But Hare praised the Desai 
event as "one of the most profound tastings of this sort we've ever done, 
because the best way to find out about a wine is to have it with food." 
</P>
<P>
Desai, a physicist at the University of California at Riverside, said the best 
wines of the tasting were, expectedly, from the greatest vintages, and he said 
the 1961 was "incredibly impressive, and the '64 was remarkable. But the thing 
that impressed us was the wines of the 1980s -- one vintage after the other 
they made excellent wines." 
</P>
<P>
(As a side note here, Desai said he and other attendees liked the '82, though 
when I ran through the first two decades of Latour at the first evening, I was 
very disappointed with the initial aroma of the wine. I found the '78 and '81 
to be superb.) 
</P>
<P>
The single best wine? Desai said it was a toss-up, with some tasters preferring 
the 1928, some the '45 and some the 1970, "and the 1900, tasted from a magnum, 
was superb." 
</P>
<P>
Desai said he had read so often of Latour's ability to make top wine even in 
off vintages that he arranged one flight of wines all of which were from off 
vintages, including bottles from 1940 and 1944, when the vines were poorly 
tended because of the war. "All the off-year wines were excellent in the sense 
that from some other producers, wines from these vintages would have been 
undrinkable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hare will next be in the United States in a few weeks conducting a tour of 
Bordeaux producers as they unveil the 1987 wines. I noted to Hare that 1987 was 
considered a rather poor vintage in Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that's why I asked to conduct this tour. We're quite proud of our '87." 
It is, after all, a Latour. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1988 Kendall-Jackson Sauvignon Blanc ($8.50) -- Some purists 
may wince when they sip this wine and find there is a trace of residual sugar. 
But after they say that, watch them drink up two or three more glasses to prove 
it to themselves. This is about as yummy a wine as Sauvignon Blanc can produce, 
with pear, melon and apple scents and a trace of lime. Hang the dollop of 
sugar; it's delicious wine.

</P>
<P>
DEAR LOIS: Part-skim ricotta cheese works well in place of the cream cheese, 
and I was able to replace the whipping cream with nonfat milk without an 
appreciable difference in the finished product. I also found I could eliminate 
the egg yolks.

CULINARY SOS: FROM TRADER JOE'S, A BAKLAVA OF MORE HEROIC PROPORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: That anemic recipe for baklava you printed won't do at all. Here is 
the best one around. It originally came from Trader Joe's, back when they used 
to give out occasional recipes, but most of the instructions are mine. This is 
the best. Trust me. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DEE: Sure, I trust you. That's because Trader Joe's baklava was a booming 
success when we tested the recipe. Hardly a morsel was left after the test 
kitchen tasters got through with it. So thanks for the recommendation. We'll 
add the recipe to those among our best. 
</P>
<P>
TRADER JOE'S HEROIC BAKLAVA 
</P>
<P>
1 pound filo dough 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound margarine (preferably all-natural margarine), melted 
</P>
<P>
Nut Filling 
</P>
<P>
Syrup 
</P>
<P>
Unwrap filo dough and fold in half, like pages of book. Keep covered with dry 
kitchen towel while working. Turn over one sheet. Brush with melted margarine, 
using soft 1 1/2- to 2-inch brush. 
</P>
<P>
Continue turning sheets (pages) and brushing with margarine until 1/3 have been 
used. Lay flat in bottom of buttered 13x9-inch baking pan. Cover with 1/2 Nut 
Filling. 
</P>
<P>
Brush another 1/3 of pages and place over nuts in pan, laying flat. Top with 
remaining Nut Filling. Brush remaining pages and lay flat on top. Brush top 
sheet with remaining margarine. 
</P>
<P>
With sharp knife, score pastry into diamonds, without quite cutting through to 
bottom. (To make diagonals, cut parallel horizontal cuts across pan, then cross 
diagonally at each horizontal point). 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until puffed, crisp and deep golden in 
color. Immediately remove from oven and pour cooled Syrup over baklava. Let 
stand 4 hours. When cool, cut through to bottom layer in scored cuts. Makes 
about 24 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Nut Filling 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds roasted, unsalted walnuts, coarsely chopped or ground 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
Combine nuts, sugar, cinnamon and cloves. 
</P>
<P>
Syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 small piece lemon peel 
</P>
<P>
1 small piece orange peel 
</P>
<P>
1 inch piece cinnamon stick 
</P>
<P>
Combine honey, water, sugar, lemon juice, lemon and orange peels and cinnamon 
stick in saucepan. Simmer 10 minutes. When syrup has cooled, discard peels and 
cinnamon stick. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I gave my recipe for Corn Beef to my daughter who lives in Japan. It 
contains parsnips and hope you can locate it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CELINE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CELINE: Here's the recipe from a column by Merle Ellis, "The Butcher." 
</P>
<P>
THE BUTCHER'S CORNED BEEF WITH VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
5 or 6 pounds corned beef brisket or rump 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, slivered 
</P>
<P>
1 onion studded with 2 cloves 
</P>
<P>
7 to 9 carrots 
</P>
<P>
6 to 8 small white onions 
</P>
<P>
6 to 8 turnips and/or parsnips 
</P>
<P>
6 to 8 potatoes, peeled 
</P>
<P>
1 head cabbage, cut into 6 to 8 pieces (do not remove core) 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Rinse meat in cold running water. Slash in several places with point of sharp 
knife and insert slivers of garlic. Place in large pot, cover with cold water 
and bring to boil over high heat. Add onions and 1 carrot, cover and simmer 2 
hours, removing any scum that forms. 
</P>
<P>
Rinse and scrub or peel remaining carrots, onions, turnips, potatoes and 
cabbage. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover with water and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five minutes before corned beef is done, place all vegetables except 
cabbage in separate pot. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer. About 20 
minutes before corn beef is done, add cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, drain and slice corned beef. Drain vegetables and arrange around 
sliced meat on hot serving platter or in big pot. Makes about 20 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with variety of mustards, pickles, black bread and beer. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Now that school is resumed, how about a granola bar recipe like the 
ones you find in the stores. Homemade ones should be a lot more economical and 
nutritious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MONICA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MONICA: You said it. 
</P>
<P>
GRANOLA BARS

With the ending of the holidays, there are a few flavors we usually forsake 
until the season rolls around again. Ginger, for one, having been liberally 
tossed into treats, often goes the way of the stockings and the tree. 
</P>
<P>
But not for me. Ginger is a flavor I will savor well into this next year. These 
tasty pancakes are adapted from Linda Merinoff's cookbook "Gingerbread" 
(Fireside). Mix the batter early, refrigerate it while you do other things and 
it will be ready for the griddle by the time you are ready. 
</P>
<P>
GINGER PANCAKES 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1 egg plus 1 egg white 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons molasses 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sifted unbleached all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine, melted and slightly cooled 
</P>
<P>
Butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
Maple syrup, jam or preserves 
</P>
<P>
Whisk together milk, egg, egg white, molasses, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt and 
baking powder. Fold in flour just until moistened, then stir in melted butter. 
Refrigerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Heat nonstick or lightly greased griddle or skillet over medium heat. For each 
pancake, drop 2 tablespoons batter, 1 on top of other. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as batter rises and small bubbles appear on surface, flip over with 
spatula. Cook 1 to 2 minutes on other side, until lightly browned. Repeat with 
remaining batter. 
</P>
<P>
Serve buttered, with maple syrup, jam or preserves. Makes 8 pancakes.

POST-HOLIDAY FLAN SOOTHES SPIRITS 
</P>

<P>
I've heard that this is a time (post-holiday) when many people go into gloom. 
The holidays were just too much for them, one way (good, I presume) or another 
(must be bad). Anyway, however their holiday spirit took shape, now this 
portion of the population is dispirited -- in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
Not me. The early days of a new year are my favorites. It's like coming home. 
Everything back to normal. Soothing. A good time to clean the house, have a 
long lunch with a friend, cook a plain meal. Or bake a custard. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a custard to bake in a ring mold. The point of Ring of Orange Flan is 
not just its shape, which is pretty good, but how much faster a ring-shaped 
flan cooks than a solid mass -- that is, in about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, it takes only about 15 minutes of a post-holiday cook's time to put 
this flan together before baking. The way I figure it, that leaves enough time 
for a long lunch (cleaning the house is not a good idea). 
</P>
<P>
RING OF ORANGE FLAN 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
6 to 8 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
Grated zest of 1 orange 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons orange liqueur 
</P>
<P>
Heat 3/4 cup sugar in heavy skillet over medium heat until melted and golden. 
Pour into 4- to 5-cup ring mold and tip carefully to coat bottom evenly. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine eggs, yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in bowl. Whisk to blend 
thoroughly. Stir in evaporated milk, orange zest and orange liqueur. Pour into 
prepared mold. 
</P>
<P>
Place mold in large pan and pour in water to come half way up ring mold. Bake 
at 325 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until custard is almost set in center. 
</P>
<P>
Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled. To serve, carefully 
run thin knife around edges and invert onto serving plate. Let stand until flan 
releases from mold and sugar syrup drains onto plate. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

MILNER DEFEATED IN ELECTION FOR AQMD BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
CLEAN AIR: GLENDALE'S MAYOR LOSES OUT TO A COVINA CITY COUNCILMAN IN BALLOTING 
TO FILL THE VACANT SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Mayor Jerold Milner suffered a decisive setback last week in his bid 
to become a voice for home rule on the regional air quality board. 
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of inconclusive balloting, the 61 cities representing Los 
Angeles County's eastern region passed over Milner and elected Covina City 
Councilman Henry Morgan unanimously to the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's 12-member governing board. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, considered a compromise candidate, was elected over Milner and the two 
candidates supported by environmental groups -- Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jan 
Heidt and San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple. Heidt and Dipple both are advocates of 
imposing strong agency regulations on cities to clean up the air in the Los 
Angeles basin, one of the most polluted in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Milner, who believes cities should have autonomy to follow their own clean-air 
policies and meet goals at their own pace, threw his support to Morgan after 
two rounds of balloting made it clear he had no chance of being elected. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg withdrew his candidacy for a board 
seat at the last minute, a move Milner said played a major role in his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The election, organized by the Los Angeles chapter of the League of California 
Cities, took place at the AQMD headquarters in El Monte. Delegates from 48 of 
the cities in the region took part in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, both Milner and environmentalists acknowledged defeat but said 
they were happy they could block each other's candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the other candidates," Milner said, "at least Morgan was the closest 
one to my position." 
</P>
<P>
In a carefully worded candidate statement, Morgan showed concern for both sides 
of the issue, stating that AQMD goals "are only attainable through proper 
compromise, sacrifice and cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
But Milner could not hide his disappointment in being defeated, nor the 
differences that separate him from the winning candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"We got what we deserve," he said, "and the cities that didn't vote for me are 
going to pay the price. The price is that we won't have that little pestering 
voice on the board fighting for change. Morgan is pretty much your status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Milner left no doubt that he is disenchanted with the status quo when he wrote 
in his candidate statement "the AQMD is a resource -- it should not be an 
omniscient dictator." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Glendale has feuded repeatedly with the agency in court and before 
agency hearing panels over how to clean up the city's Scholl Canyon Landfill. 
More recently the two clashed over how to control emissions from the steam 
boilers in the city's power plant. On several occasions the city barely averted 
paying fines of up to $50,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said the city of Long Beach -- which he had considered a natural ally -- 
played a major role in his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Under the complicated formula used in Thursday night's election, the winner 
needed two-thirds of the cities' votes, plus the votes from delegates 
representing two-thirds of the region's population. Since Long Beach and 
Glendale are easily the largest cities in the region -- which does not include 
the city of Los Angeles -- an alliance between the two would have given them 
virtual veto power over the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with its relatively clean air, operates one of two incinerators in 
the county despite strong opposition from environmental groups. Kellogg had 
expressed fears that the AQMD would impose standards on incinerators that are 
too tough to meet, or ban the practice altogether. 
</P>
<P>
If any city would support Glendale's bid, Milner said, he believed it would be 
Long Beach. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
On the first ballot, Milner got 11 votes with Long Beach abstaining, he said. 
On the second ballot, his vote total went down to 10, and Long Beach voted for 
Morgan. On the third ballot, Milner withdrew his candidacy and voted for 
Morgan, who was elected unanimously on the fourth ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Why Long Beach didn't support him, Milner said, "is anybody's guess." 
</P>
<P>
Milner said the other cities did not vote against him because they rejected his 
platform. He simply was defeated by a more popular candidate, Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Morgan has been active on the League of Cities for many years, and he 
could get on the phone and get more commitments than me," Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agreed. "I think the cities showed they don't want to be 
perceived as reactionary. That's why they didn't vote for the Glendale mayor," 
said Mark Abramowitz, program director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a Los 
Angeles-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
"However," he added, "I think it's somewhat disturbing that the cities did not 
follow the people's mandate in the valleys to vote for an environmental 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition had previously endorsed Dipple, but Abramowitz said he would have 
been equally comfortable had Heidt been elected. As for Morgan, Abramowitz said 
he was somewhat of an unknown quantity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Morgan will have a chance to show if he is an environmentalist or not. 
The public and the coalition will be watching him very carefully. As of this 
week, we are initiating a Morgan Watch," Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
As an AQMD board member, Morgan will oversee the implementation of the agency's 
ambitious 20-year plan approved in March to bring the Los Angeles basin up to 
federal and state clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The election was forced by the resignation of Baldwin Park Councilman Leo King, 
who moved to Oklahoma. Morgan will serve out the year left in King's two-year 
term. The eastern region stretches from Long Beach to Pomona and as far north 
as the Santa Clarita Valley. The AQMD Board is made up of three state 
appointees, four county representatives and five city delegates from Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD plan calls for stiff pollution controls on industry, traffic-reduction 
measures and a balanced commercial/residential growth so residents can work in 
the cities in which they live and avoid long commutes. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan called the plan "a dynamic document built to be revised and adjusted to 
meet the compliance capabilities of cities and industries," signaling both his 
commitment to the plan and his concern for how cities and industries will be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Don Rutherford said that, politics notwithstanding, Morgan's 
election is a symbolic victory for the east San Gabriel Valley, the most 
polluted area in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the fact that a San Gabriel Valley candidate was selected may 
indicate that the cities were concerned with the severe air pollution in the 
San Gabriel Valley and thought those problems would be best dealt with by a 
candidate from that area," he said.

MINISTER ORDERED TO REPAY 6 IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Glendale minister accused of illegally charging six immigrants for 
residency cards he was unable to produce has been put on probation and ordered 
to return thousands of dollars to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Elie Khoury, 50, pleaded no contest last Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court 
to two counts of grand theft. As part of an agreement, a judge dropped two 
other charges of grand theft and one count of attempted grand theft and 
sentenced him to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered Khoury to pay $7,500 in restitution to the six 
immigrants on whose behalf the five criminal charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good news. Criminals like him, they should pay for what they've done," 
said Faye Garoian, a Lebanese immigrant who with her husband, Kevork, paid 
Khoury $2,100 to obtain a green card. "A priest is supposed to be an honest 
person. What is religion coming to?" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Khoury, director of the Kingdom and World Mission of Our Lord 
Jesus Christ, posed for three years as an immigration consultant who, for fees 
as high as $1,500, falsely promised clients green cards. He then refused to 
refund the money to dissatisfied clients, claiming the fees were donations to 
his church -- at the time a storefront operation and his home at 1250 S. 
Glendale Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The self-styled minister was arrested Dec. 2, 1988, after threatening to have 
clients deported or physically harmed if they reported him to authorities, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard de la Sota. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges followed a civil suit filed in late 1988 by the state 
attorney general's office, which accused Khoury of bilking as many as 200 
families out of an average $1,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, still pending, alleges that Khoury told his clients he had been 
authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to collect money for 
his services. He had in fact been denied authorization several times, said 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Jerry Smilowitz. 
</P>
<P>
Smilowitz said the civil suit asks for a permanent injunction barring Khoury 
from providing immigration consulting services for fees, and as much as 
$200,000 in restitution and civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury's no-contest plea to the criminal charges, although treated like a 
guilty plea for sentencing purposes, cannot be used as an admission of guilt in 
the civil proceedings. A Superior Court hearing on the civil suit is set for 
Jan. 17. Khoury is expected to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, Khoury's probation officer will determine whether he has made a 
good-faith effort to pay the $7,500 in restitution ordered by the court. If he 
hasn't, he could spend a year in jail, said Larry Rivetz, a Los Angeles County 
public defender who represented Khoury last week in court. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury spent almost two months in jail before he was freed on bail in 1989. 
Since then, he has moved his church and family to Hollywood. In a telephone 
interview, Khoury said that he still holds small services for his family and 
friends, but that his facilities and resources are limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing. We are suffering. We are struggling," he said, adding that 
his family is now on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury said he will graduate in March from a nearby business college -- where 
he is studying law enforcement -- and look for a job. During the interview, he 
maintained his innocence but pledged to pay the restitution by working or 
obtaining a loan. Khoury maintains that his clients donated the money to the 
church. He also said that despite the contrary claims of the INS, he expects 
the agency to notify him soon that he has been authorized to perform 
immigration services. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the length of probation, I think he'll be able to make 
restitution," Rivetz said. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors and some of those who were bilked said they expect a long wait 
for the return of the money. State investigators never discovered where the 
fees collected by Khoury went. 
</P>
<P>
"God only knows," Smilowitz said. "Certainly no pun intended by that. But we've 
never been able to locate any active bank accounts or appreciable assets."

REPORTER SENTENCED TO PICK UP TRASH FOR SLAPPING POLICEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newspaper reporter who slapped a Glendale police officer after she was 
stopped for an illegal turn was ordered last week to spend 30 days picking up 
trash along freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph F. De Vanon on Friday also placed 
Hollywood resident Rose Demirjian on two years probation and ordered her to pay 
a $700 fine and write a letter of apology to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
In a rocky ending to what one court official called the "Zsa Zsa case," De 
Vanon threatened to jail the protesting Demirjian if she didn't follow his 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
After a non-jury trial last Thursday, De Vanon found Demirjian, 38, guilty of 
misdemeanor battery on a police officer, resisting an officer, making an 
illegal U-turn and driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
Demirjian, a news and features writer for the Armenian Reporter, acted as her 
own attorney. During the two-hour trial, she frequently interrupted the judge, 
calling the police officer and witnesses who testified against her "liars." 
</P>
<P>
"Your continued refusal to face up to your conduct . . . is incredible," said 
De Vanon, who also barred her from driving without insurance and a valid 
license. 
</P>
<P>
The judge gave Demirjian until April 5 to perform the community service for the 
state Department of Transportation and write a letter of apology to Officer 
Behrouz Hashemi. 
</P>
<P>
Demirjian on Thursday defiantly declared she would appeal. But after the 
sentencing on Friday, the Lebanese immigrant laughed quietly and held back 
tears, still maintaining her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to take the trash," she said. "I don't want to go to jail. What I 
don't like is if I don't write a letter to the jerk, I have to go to jail. He 
should apologize to me." 
</P>
<P>
Hashemi and four witnesses testified that Demirjian scuffled with the officer 
Oct. 30 after a routine traffic stop on Brand Boulevard near Harvard Street. 
</P>
<P>
Hashemi told the judge that he asked the woman for her driver's license after 
he saw her make an illegal U-turn, but that she walked away instead. The 
officer grabbed her wrist, attempting to stop her, and Demirjian slapped him, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that the woman yelled obscenities at the officer and 
struggled as he tried to handcuff her. 
</P>
<P>
Demirjian repeatedly told De Vanon that she had resisted Hashemi but did not 
slap him or utter obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials compared Demirjian's case with that of actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, 
who in October was found guilty of slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle officer. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, who has appealed the ruling, was ordered to spend three days in jail, 
pay about $13,000 in fines, perform 120 hours of community service and visit a 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
But Demirjian, who smiled when told of the comparison, disagreed with it. "Zsa 
Zsa is different. I'm an honorable woman," she said.

OFFICER FIRED AFTER REPORT ON PROSTITUTE SETTLES SUIT;

<P>
POLICE: AN OFFICER SAID HIS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED AFTER 
REPORTING A CITY COUNCILMAN WAS SEEN WITH A PROSTITUTE.

<TEXT>
<P>
A settlement has been reached between the city and a police officer who had 
charged that his civil rights were violated when he was fired in 1987 after he 
reported that a city councilman had been seen with a known prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was settled last Thursday as a federal jury was to begin hearing 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were sealed by U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi, 
and the parties in the case would not comment. The officer, Richard Rice, 
previously had rejected a city offer of $50,000, saying he was seeking $100,000 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Rice filed the federal complaint in September, 1988, against the city of Bell 
Gardens, City Manager Claude Booker, then-Assistant City Manager Maria Aguirre 
and Police Chief William Donohoe. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was placed on administrative leave, then fired, after he filed a police 
report stating that an officer under his command saw a known prostitute get 
into Councilman Roger McComas' motor home. 
</P>
<P>
He was reinstated, with full back pay, in March, 1989, after a Superior Court 
judge ruled that Rice had been improperly dismissed, and an appellate court 
upheld the decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the Superior Court hearing, Chief Donohoe said Rice was fired because he 
lied in talking with the president of the local police union about the police 
report on the councilman. The judge said, however, that there was no proof of 
such a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
When news reports of the McComas incident first were published, the councilman 
called the report as a "big, made-up story." 
</P>
<P>
McComas, who last spring became mayor of Bell Gardens, later acknowledged that 
he picked up a known prostitute "for the heck of it," but said he did not 
solicit or have sex with her, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office in May, 1987, decided not to prosecute McComas 
for soliciting prostitution, saying there was not enough evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The incident first was reported by Officer Joe Marquez, who said he saw a known 
prostitute run up to McComas' motor home at a tavern on Eastern Avenue. The 
woman, Marquez reported, opened the passenger door and climbed in. 
</P>
<P>
After a trip around the block, Marquez reported, the motor home stopped again 
just outside the bar, and the woman got out. Marquez then questioned the woman, 
who told him the driver was a "regular customer" who used an alias, according 
to the police report. The woman said the driver gave her money "not to tell the 
police what we do or to mention the motor home," Marquez reported. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the settlement, Rice said he believed he was entitled to 
more than regaining his job, with back pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unemployed for 12 months," Rice said "I had a lot of time to think about 
this. There's been a lot of depression, anger and resentment at what people 
tried to get away with. They seem to do what they want, when they want, and I 
want to keep that from happening again."

WARD GETS $13,000 FINE IN CAMPAIGN FUND VIOLATION

<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission on Tuesday unanimously agreed to fine 
Bellflower school board member Larry Ward $13,000 for campaign reporting 
violations arising from his unsuccessful 1986 campaign for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents prepared by the commission staff, Ward violated the 
Political Reform Act by reporting two $10,000 campaign contributions even 
though he "knew or had reason to know that there was no actual monetary 
contribution to him or his committee . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff had recommended that the five-member panel accept the 
settlement with Ward, a member of the Bellflower Unified School District board 
since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Ward, 47, of Lakewood, acknowledged making a mistake but 
denied doing "anything intentionally . . . to mislead the voters." Ward 
described the $13,000 fine as excessive, saying that $4,000 "would have been 
fair." The fine was $1,000 short of the maximum the commission could impose. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the central issue in the case revolved around the way he reported 
campaign donations from Ingram Industries of Bellflower as cash contributions. 
He should have listed them as in-kind donations of office space, printing, 
telephones and other services to help run the campaign, Ward said. "We did it 
wrong and we should be fined," Ward acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the commission rejected a proposed $9,000 settlement in the case 
because of concerns that the amount was too low considering the nature of 
Ward's violations. 
</P>
<P>
The violations stem for a bitter 1986 Democratic primary in which Ward was one 
of nine candidates seeking the seat of retiring Assemblyman Frank Vicencia 
(D-Bellflower). The primary was won by Edward Waters, who lost the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he plans to pay the entire fine, even though his volunteer campaign 
treasurer, Christine Hinton, was cited for having improperly labeled campaign 
statements. "She only followed my direction," Ward said.

COMPTON'S CHIEF OF POLICE, THREE AIDES TO RETIRE EARLY; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE FOUR OFFICIALS ARE LEAVING UNDER AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS 
DESIGNED TO EASE THE CITY'S FISCAL PROBLEMS.

<P>
The city is losing four top-ranking police executives, including its 
chief,under an early retirement incentive program designed to help ease the 
city's budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Ivory J. Webb, 51, who has headed the police force since 1986, will 
retire Feb. 28, and three of his four commanders say they will be gone by the 
end of April. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide search is being started to replace Webb, according to city 
personnel director Sally Taylor. However, the commanders will probably not be 
replaced because of a reorganization plan that eliminates top police jobs in 
order to cut a department budget that has reached about $15 million. The police 
budget in the 1985-86 fiscal year was about $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said as many as 20 city employees might decide to take early retirement, 
which would save the city about $450,000 through June 30, according to 
preliminary estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Ebert, the only police commander who is not retiring, said administrative 
police retirements could save the department about $800,000 a year, according 
to preliminary estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The police reorganization plan, which still is being refined, is also designed 
to respond to complaints by some council members that the police force is 
top-heavy with administrators. At least two of the departing commanders would 
have been demoted -- one possibly to sergeant -- had they not retired, 
according to police officials. 
</P>
<P>
The city last summer demoted four police lieutenants to sergeants and four 
sergeants to patrol officers to save money. At the same time, 85 workers in 
other departments were laid off to balance the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
Webb avoided discussing any aspect of the retirements except in terms of what 
he accomplished as chief and the new opportunities that he is considering. "It 
is intended to be an amiable departure that I have been looking forward to," he 
said. "I'm very pleased with my career and the city's been very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he plans to explore other employment opportunities, including 
consulting work. He joined the department in 1963 as a patrolman. A graduate of 
Centennial High School, he holds a degree in criminology from Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Other officers were bitter and more outspoken on the retirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the executive staff of this police department is going out 
the door by April," said one officer who asked not to be identified by name. 
"That leaves one commander and some lieutenants and sergeants," the officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Howard Caldwell said the department and the citizens will not 
suffer because of the retirements. "There's a fiscal problem, there's no doubt 
but the police department has always been the council's No. 1 priority and it 
continues to be so." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who has complained that the department has too 
many administrators, said budget constraints demand that the department be 
streamlined. Police are needed on the street, she said. "What good does it do 
to have them sitting at a desk . . . who said we need all these commanders." 
</P>
<P>
Moore pointed out that the city's budget problems are so severe that on Tuesday 
the council eliminated nine more positions. The seven-employee cable television 
and public information office was eliminated, along with the contract 
compliance officer's job and an analyst's position in the economic and grants 
management department. The cuts, which are expected to occur in about 30 days, 
will save about $700,000 a year. The three retiring commanders are Thomas 
Armstrong, 51, head of the bureau of investigative services; Dallas Elvis, 57, 
operational services, and Robert Ruiz, 50, bureau of field services. All began 
their careers as patrol officers in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who joined the department in 1963, will retire Feb. 24. Ruiz retires 
Feb. 2 after more than 30 years of service. Ruiz, who joined the force in 1967, 
plans to retire April 27. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said he would seek employment in the private sector. "I don't want to 
be bothered with public service any more. It's just left a bad taste in my 
mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The department has grown and become more progressive during his 27-year career, 
Armstrong said. But he expressed concern over budget cuts and the council 
criticism, combined with worsening conditions in inner-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong also said Mayor Walter R. Tucker's call last year to dismantle the 
force and contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department only rubbed 
salt in wounds already opened by council remarks about police failures to deal 
with the city's high crime rate. The mayor eventually dropped his suggestion 
after intense criticism from the police. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that they gave us a way out and I just took it," Armstrong said of his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis said, "I think they're having some serious money problems. That's no 
secret and I'd rather not watch things deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
The retirements, Ruiz said, will leave a void. "But there's people here who can 
pick up the gauntlet," he said. "The department will survive." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said about 20 city employees are expected to accept "the golden 
handshake," as employees call the early retirement plan. Taylor would not 
disclose the names of other employees who have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the plan, which was developed in cooperation with the state 
Public Employees Retirement System, the city will pay extra pension premiums 
that buy the retirees two extra years of service, Taylor said. The state also 
allowed the city to count unused sick days as salary, which raises a retiree's 
pension because the monthly pension is based partly on years of service and 
partly on salary.

CONFLICT RULE RELAXED FOR SMALL CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: THE EXEMPTION WILL ALLOW OFFICIALS IN 'ITTY-BITTY' CITIES TO VOTE 
ON DEVELOPMENTS NEAR THEIR HOMES.

<P>
Sparked by a dispute in Signal Hill, the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission on Tuesday agreed to exempt public officials in about 190 
"itty-bitty cities" from some economic conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Tim O'Donnell, Signal Hill assistant city manager, said he is 
satisfied with the action because the city won "90% of what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a commission regulation that restricts the voting power of 
officials whose principal residence is near a proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, officials who live between 300 and 2,500 feet from a project may 
vote on it, but only if neighboring property will receive the same treatment as 
their homes. Under rules unanimously adopted by the commission, public 
officials in about 42% of the state's 453 cities will be exempted from this 
provision. The new regulation will relax the requirement for cities with 
populations of less than 25,000, where city council members are elected on an 
at-large basis and where the city is 10 square miles or less. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, if officials own homes closer than 300 feet from a development, 
they would in most circumstances be required to disqualify themselves from a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Lily Spitz, the commission's legislative coordinator, told the five-member 
panel that the new regulation is narrowly drawn to have an impact only on 
"itty-bitty cities." 
</P>
<P>
The League of California Cities said only two small cities -- Bradbury in the 
San Gabriel Valley and Ripon in the San Joaquin Valley -- would be unaffected 
by the regulation because they elect council members by district. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kress, Bradbury city attorney, said his city "probably doesn't care" about 
the regulation "because it's a wealthy community" with large estates and no 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
In Signal Hill, the issue came to a head last year when two massive 
developments were proposed. The projects could add 1,300 residential units on 
130 acres in the two-square-mile hilltop city with a population of about 8,500. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill Councilman Louis Dare told the commission that he and other council 
members must regularly disqualify themselves from votes because they live 
between 300 and 2,500 feet of the project or, as in his case, within 300 feet. 
He described the situation as causing constant turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the 300 feet requirement arbitrary, Dare said he would prefer that the 
commission eliminate that restriction as well. In support of his position, Dare 
submitted a petition to the commission signed by 49 of his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission rejected his suggestion. It also rejected a proposal from 
the city of Paramount to exempt officials from conflict-of-interest provisions, 
no matter the distance of their homes from a development.

CITY EMPLOYEES TO GET CHANCE TO VOTE ON UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bellflower City Council has passed an employer-employee relations 
resolution that paves the way for an election among city employees to determine 
whether they should be represented by a union for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
After about an hour of debate, the council approved the resolution by a 4-1 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joe Cvetko said an election could take place in about 25 days. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Schnaufer, a representative of the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, said, however, that the resolution would prohibit a 
union from representing as many employees as it wants and allows management to 
punish employees at the bargaining table by making the last offer. If employees 
refuse the last offer, Schnaufer said, they would receive no raise at all. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Cvetko, who voted for the resolution, said it was necessary that the 
city protect some of its interests. He said the resolution was passed in order 
to move ahead with the election. "Now the rank and file can decide if they want 
a union or not," he said.

ADMINISTRATOR TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Administrator Robert Clute, who has held several closed door meetings with 
the City Council recently to discuss his job, said Wednesday that he will 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
"I have advised the council of my intent to retire at such time as they can 
conveniently have a successor on board," said the 16-year administrator, 
refusing to elaborate. Clute, 64, whose annual salary is $82,000, came to San 
Gabriel from Vancouver, Wash., where he had been city manager for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Clute's resignation marks the second time in recent months that a long-time 
city official has left. Donald Tutich resigned as police chief last October.

1 ARRESTED, OTHERS SOUGHT IN DRIVE-BY FATALITY

<P>
An 18-year-old Whittier man was in custody Wednesday and others were being 
sought in connection with the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy and the 
wounding of a 19-year-old man in a Santa Fe Springs park. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which sheriff's investigators said may be gang-related, occurred 
about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at Little Lake Park following an argument between a 
group of teen-agers and a carload of men cruising past. 
</P>
<P>
Following the verbal altercation, witnesses and investigators said, the people 
in the car pulled a gun from beneath the hood of their vehicle and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old was shot in the chest, and the other victim was wounded in the 
leg. Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of preservationists have withdrawn their objection to the development 
of a three-acre foothill parcel on Santa Anita Avenue owned by Lawson and 
Annette Martin. 
</P>
<P>
The Martins, who own another 11.2 acres on Santa Anita Avenue, originally 
sought to build four houses on the smaller parcel, then reduced the number to 
two. 
</P>
<P>
The director of public works approved the smaller proposed development, 
including a condition that would have allowed the Martins to install an 
electronic gate on the road to Chantry Flats in order to reach the property. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic gate would replace a gate on Santa Anita Avenue that is now 
chained and locked from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m. However, the electronic gate would 
have to be approved by other agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
The preservationists had planned to appeal the approval, but withdrew their 
objection after the Martins signed a deed restriction permanently limiting 
construction to two houses on the entire acreage.

WALL ADVOCATES ASK CITY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who want a wall to muffle sound between their apartment building and 
the nearby San Bernardino Freeway have asked the city to represent them in a 
class-action suit against state transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of freeway near the apartments does not qualify for a sound wall 
because the units were built after construction of the freeway, state officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Royal Gardens residents, Michael Rotstan, told the City 
Council on Monday that a wall is needed for safety, especially to protect 
children who may wander onto the freeway. The complex is in the 3100 and 3200 
blocks of West Ramona Road. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to consider the residents' request on Feb. 13, when results 
of a freeway noise test by Caltrans will be available.

6 BUILDINGS DESIGNATED AS CULTURAL LANDMARKS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has named six buildings as Long Beach cultural heritage 
landmarks: the Fire Engine Company No. 8 building, the Golden House, the 
Masonic Temple, the Pacific Tower, St. Anthony's Church and St. Luke's 
Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
The firehouse, built in 1929 in Renaissance Revival style, is a prominent 
neighborhood landmark in Belmont Shore. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden House, constructed about 1886, is a single-story wooden house on 
West 10th Street that is thought to be the oldest building in the city. The 
York Rite Masonic Temple on Locust Street was built in 1927 and contains a 
number of individual halls decorated in a different exotic revival style, such 
as Egyptian and Roman. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown Pacific Tower, a 12-story office building dating from 1923, was 
the first "own-your-own" office building in the nation. St. Anthony's Church on 
Olive Avenue is the leading Catholic Church in Long Beach and replaced an 
earlier church destroyed in the 1933 earthquake. St. Luke's Episcopal Church on 
Atlantic Avenue was rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style after the earthquake.

The East Whittier City School District has appropriated $74,877 to help 
purchase new literature books to replace the controversial Holt series, which 
was sent back to the publisher in November because board members said they 
received the wrong edition. 
</P>
<P>
The district is suing the publisher, Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, for breach of 
contract over the mix-up, which sparked heated debates among teachers and 
parents who said the distributed edition contained satanic material. 
</P>
<P>
According to Assistant Supt. Ron Oliver, each school will be allocated $10 per 
student to buy new books. The books will be selected by teachers and school 
officials from a state-approved list.

GOLF FEES WILL INCREASE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teeing off at the Alhambra Golf Course is going to be a little more expensive 
beginning Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
To help pay for general maintenance and improvements at the 18-hole course, the 
City Council on Monday voted to raise fees by amounts ranging from 50 cents to 
$2, depending on when the rounds are played. Under the new formula, for 
example, playing 18 holes on a weekend would cost $14, up from $12. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed increases have been posted at the city golf course since early 
December, and there have been no complaints from players, said Jerry Wisz, a 
golf professional who manages the course.

AUDIT OF HOSPITAL SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To help solve Alhambra Community Hospital's money problems and at the same time 
end the city's financial woes, the City Council has introduced an ordinance 
calling for an audit of hospital operations. 
</P>
<P>
Final approval of the audit requires a second council vote. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Monday, the council also voted to place on the April 
ballot a measure asking voters to repeal a 1982 initiative that set conditions 
on the sale of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, owned by the Alhambra Redevelopment Agency, has fallen behind in 
its rent payments, forcing the council to cut the city budget and increase 
municipal fees.

TANNER DECIDES NOT TO SEEK MONTOYA'S SENATE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) announced Tuesday that she has 
decided not to run for the seat of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya and will seek 
reelection in the 60th Assembly District this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner, elected to the Assembly in 1978, acknowledged that she had considered 
running for the 26th Senate District seat now occupied by the Whittier 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said in a statement that "to succeed in such an effort would require me 
to devote the next five months to campaigning as a virtual full-time candidate. 
That would have made it impossible for me to continue with my duties as chair 
of the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, whose term is up this year, is on trial in federal court on charges of 
bribery, extortion, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) is expected to be a candidate for 
Montoya's seat. Calderon, who represents the 59th Assembly District, said he 
understands the Montoya case will go to the jury later this month. "I expect 
that I'll have an announcement after the return of the verdict by the jury," he 
said Tuesday.

NEW BONDS FOR OLD DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to issue about $25 million in new bonds to take 
advantage of current lower interest rates in paying off the Glendora Community 
Redevelopment Agency debt. 
</P>
<P>
The agency owes $10.4 million from three bond issues with interest rates of 
more than 9%. The new bonds, which will be retired in 20 years, will be at 
7.7%. The new bonds will also generate $5.3 million for capital projects, $3.2 
million to repay loans from the city, and $4.5 million toward buying property 
for low- and moderate-income housing.

2 LA CANADA COUNCIL MEMBERS SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE BAILIE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge's eldest statesman, Mayor Edmund Krause, was one of two 
incumbents who announced they will seek reelection to the five-member City 
Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, 88, is the oldest mayor in California, according to the League of 
California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
The other incumbent to announce her candidacy was Councilwoman Joan Feehan. 
</P>
<P>
The third council member whose term expires in April, O. Warren Hillgren, said 
he has not yet decided whether he will run for reelection April 10. The terms 
of Mayor Pro Tem Chris Valente and Councilman Ed Phelps, both elected to the 
council in 1988, will be not be up until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Krause said he decided to run for reelection because "there are still so many 
issues that have to be resolved and I want to help out and be involved where I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Sport Chalet shopping complex, the Lanterman House renovation 
project and municipal sanitation top the list of subjects Krause said he wants 
to tackle as a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
Krause has served on the La Canada Flintridge City Council since the city's 
incorporation in 1976. He was mayor from April, 1982, to April, 1983. His 
second one-year term as mayor began last April. 
</P>
<P>
Valente said he was surprised by Krause's decision to seek reelection. He 
described Krause as "a cute old man who knows his way around with a lot of 
politicians. He knows how to talk to the federal people, the state people and 
the county people." 
</P>
<P>
Krause's political roots reach back to the early 1800s, when his 
great-grandfather and grandfather served as mayors in an area of Prussia that 
is now Poland. 
</P>
<P>
His first experience in politics was as a volunteer for the election and 
reelection campaigns of the late Frank Lanterman, who served in the California 
Assembly from 1951 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow Councilman Ed Phelps said he wished Krause well but described him as 
"difficult to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Council members Feehan and Hillgren declined to comment on Krause. 
</P>
<P>
Feehan was elected to the City Council in 1986 and served as mayor from April, 
1988, to April, 1989. She said she wants to focus her political efforts on the 
city's development issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city is basically built out and our community is going through a drastic 
recycling," Feehan said. "In the next four years, the City Council is going to 
have to make decisions that will affect all the residents. We'll have to take a 
hard look at population density, lot coverage, and neighborhood compatibility." 
</P>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge issued about 600 building and remodeling permits in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest industry is real estate," Feehan continued. "That's why I support 
the hillside moratorium. The hillsides are all that we have left." 
</P>
<P>
To qualify as a candidate for the April 10 election ballot, residents must 
obtain 20 signed endorsements from registered voters in the city by Feb. 1.

SENATE SEAT BATTLE PROMISES TO BE QUICK, DIRTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the prospect of a charged debate over ethics and abortion in a short 
five-week campaign, the special election to replace former state Sen. William 
Campbell promises to be quick and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they were going to sling so much mud so fast," said Sal Russo, 
a political consultant for Assemblyman Frank Hill, the candidate who so far has 
drawn most of the dirt. "It started right away." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian decided just before the holidays to set the special 
primary for Feb. 6, in part so that Republican Assembly members could run 
without risking their seats in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
Hill (R-Whittier) and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) are among 
eight candidates running to represent the predominantly Republican 31st 
District that straddles the Los Angeles and Orange County border. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates waited until the New Year and then launched a mad five-week dash 
last Tuesday. So far, almost every day has involved accusations and 
name-calling. Candidates have criticized both Hill and Ferguson for accepting 
what their opponents say are excessive honorariums, and last week Hill was 
attacked by three candidates for mailing a letter that they said implied he was 
endorsed by Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, first elected to the 31st Senate District from Hacienda Heights in 
1976, resigned last month to become president of the California Manufacturers 
Assn. He has told the candidates that his contract prevents him from endorsing 
a successor. 
</P>
<P>
The major factors expected to influence the race are: 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice forces that are hoping to turn the campaign into a repeat of 
California's last two special elections, in which their candidates upset 
anti-abortion opponents. This race has some of the same dynamics, with a 
pro-choice Republican encouraging Democratic crossovers and two anti-abortion 
Republicans who could split their constituency. 
</P>
<P>
An ongoing FBI investigation of Hill involving an influence-peddling scandal at 
the Capitol. Hill, meanwhile, has been the prime target of the other candidates 
because he appears to be the best financed and he has the backing of Republican 
leaders in the Assembly and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy negative campaigning that is likely to limit the discussion of issues 
and discourage voters in an election that was already expected to have a low 
turnout of about 20%. The shortness of the race and the presence of some 
little-known candidates have contributed to the attacks, since it is easier to 
sully an opponent than it is to sell an unknown candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The district stretches from Whittier and West Covina in Los Angeles County to 
Laguna Beach in southern Orange County. Its registration is solidly Republican, 
about 60%, to 30% Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight candidates who filed on Dec. 26, only Hill and Ferguson have 
served in the Legislature. But Ron Isles, a city councilman from Brea, has been 
included among the leaders because of his claim that he will spend up to 
$500,000 of his own money on the campaign, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, a consultant who sold his electronics manufacturing company in 1981, is 
also a pro-choice Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates are Republican Gary C. Miller, a city councilman from 
Diamond Bar; Democrat Bradley J. McFadden, a councilman from West Covina; 
Janice L. Graham, secretary of the Orange County Democratic Party; Thomas M. 
Whaling, a Democratic attorney from El Toro; and Robert W. Lewis of Rowland 
Heights, who filed for the race with the American Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote on Feb. 6, a runoff between 
the top Republican and Democratic vote-getters will be held April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he is counting on a strong showing in Orange County to win the 
race, since 60% of the Republican voters in the district are on his side of the 
county line. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of running a negative campaign, Ferguson said, he will stress his 
background as a family man who has worked in business, served in the military 
and won three terms in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Hill said he hopes to campaign on his accomplishments during eight 
years in the Assembly and on his "reputation for getting things done in 
Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
And he said his geographic base is stronger than Ferguson's because half of the 
population in the Senate district is within the boundaries of his Assembly 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' campaign is counting on the race becoming topsy-turvy with a groundswell 
of voters turning out either because of the ethics issue or abortion, two of 
the hottest political subjects of the 1990 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Isles has repeatedly attacked Hill and Ferguson, charging that they have been 
unethical in office. Most often he has criticized Hill for being a subject of 
the FBI's Capitol sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has been accused in court testimony during the corruption trial of state 
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) of accepting a $5,000 honorarium in return 
for his support of legislation for a shrimp company. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done anything wrong," Hill said. "I know as much about the 
investigation as anybody who reads the papers." Hill also said he does not know 
how the investigation will affect his race. 
</P>
<P>
Isles was endorsed by Pro-Choice Orange County, a bipartisan organization that 
was formed in response to the Supreme Court's Webster decision in July, which 
gave states more authority to regulate abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Schwartz, a Democrat and president of Pro-Choice Orange County, said she 
expects Democrats to vote for Isles because of his pro-choice position on 
abortion and the likelihood of a Republican winner.

HENRY M. MORGAN; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MEMBER HAS A CLEAR VIEW OF CHALLENGES FOR AQMD BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside the steak and lobster restaurant where he had just lunched, Henry M. 
Morgan surveyed the vista of what might be called the buckle of Southern 
California's smog belt. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too bad today," said Morgan, eyeing the midday haze that gave a murky 
green cast to the hills of West Covina. "But, boy, do you like those days when 
you can see the mountains!" 
</P>
<P>
Last week, delegates from cities in the eastern half of Los Angeles County 
elected the 62-year-old Covina councilman to the 12-member South Coast Air 
Quality Management District board. The Los Angeles County branch of the 
California League of Cities oversaw the election, held at the AQMD headquarters 
in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who represents 61 cities from Long Beach to Pomona to Santa Clarita, 
replaces Leo King, the former Baldwin Park mayor who resigned late last year to 
move to Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Talking in rapid bursts and with a no-nonsense style during an interview this 
week, Morgan cast himself as a can-do man who will approach air quality issues 
in the pragmatic way that he handles everything else. 
</P>
<P>
His attraction to public matters, he said, stems from an interest in solving 
problems. "How you solve it or how you sell it -- that's been my business for 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Since retiring three years ago after a 35-year career in the technical, 
marketing and sales areas of IBM, he has made a full-time job of being a public 
official. In October, he became a board member of the Los Angeles Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. A Covina councilman since 1978, he is a past 
president of the Los Angeles division of the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
His resume lists affiliations with an assortment of governmental and 
quasi-public groups with names such as the Waste-By-Rail Subcommittee, the East 
San Gabriel Valley Manpower Committee and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in La Jolla, "I was always fascinated by how things 
work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a physics major at Pomona college in the late 1940s and early 
1950s, atomic energy fascinated him. Even today, during his vacations he visits 
unlikely spots for a tourist. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife'll tell you that if I go within 50 miles of a hydroelectric plant, I 
want to stop. I've probably visited every power plant in California. . . . I'll 
go to Hawaii and try to visit the waterworks. I have a basic interest in these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
He said he pursued the job on the air quality board because it seemed like an 
intellectual challenge -- not because fighting air pollution is a passionate 
personal crusade. "I don't have a physical or emotional reaction to anything," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he recounted a story about the time 30 years ago when he had first moved 
to one of Covina's new subdivisions. He was digging a trench at his new house. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't work but a few minutes because the reaction to the air was so 
strong," he said. "The air isn't that bad -- that often -- anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The change has resulted from stricter regulations governing air pollution, he 
said, and continued progress depends on work by the air quality board. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he is new to the task and that he will be only one of 12 
decision-makers, Morgan said he still believes that he can serve as an 
important voice. On environmental issues, he said, he is middle-of-the-road. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the environmentalists that, yeah, we've got to do something. But 
let's make sure we don't just say: 'Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wil Baca, the Hacienda Heights environmental activist who is on the board of 
the Coalition for Clean Air, expressed disappointment that candidates backed by 
his group were not selected for the board. Initially, Baca said, 
environmentalists supported Duarte Councilman John Hitt, but then he dropped 
from the race. So their backing shifted to San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple, who 
lost to Morgan in the election last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Baca said he believes Morgan will be "open and available to hear the views 
of the environmental groups." 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm feeling fairly comfortable with the position he's taken and the 
assurances he's given us," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
As a new board member, Morgan said, his job will be to be a good listener to 
all points of view. And he likens the difficulty of solving the air pollution 
problem to "trying to boil the ocean: It's a very tough job." 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. area's smog solutions "will be the precursor of what happens with it 
in the entire world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the weekly meeting of the Covina Sunrise Rotary Club one recent morning, 
Morgan said, fellow Rotarians congratulated him for a beautiful sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I couldn't promise that every day," he said. "If we get the 
problem fixed in 10 years, we'll be lucky. And it won't be perfect by then, but 
it'll sure be better."

DRAWING ON RESERVES; 
</P>
<P>
TWO FORMER STARTERS STAR AS ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNGER 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their college days are at last running out, although not quite as they had 
hoped. Starters for much of their basketball careers, Rudolph Harvey Jr. and 
Darrell Faulkner are adjusting to being reserves for Cal State Long Beach while 
preparing for the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who dunks the ball spectacularly and envisions a life as a TV 
scriptwriter, came to Long Beach from Fresno in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, a studious and musical Memphis native who spent three years at the 
University of South Alabama before leaving with the hope of perhaps running 
into Quincy Jones, is in his second season with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
While their court time has decreased, neither fifth-year senior complains. Both 
are contributing on a team that has had its best start (9-2) in 16 years. Last 
week, Harvey scored 10 points and grabbed six rebounds in a 66-60 victory over 
Cal State Fresno, and Faulkner had a steal, assist and basket in a five-minute 
stint that sparked an 81-75 win over University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Their value extends to being role models for their young teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"They have great character, and that always comes through," Coach Joe 
Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, a 6-foot-5 forward, started 17 games last year and his 8.6-point 
average was the best of his career. He had anticipated starting this season, 
even with the arrival of young, bigger forwards, such as Kevin Cutler and 
Frankie Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this would be my year to shine," Harvey said. "Maybe it will be by 
coming off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
"He has handled the situation," said Seth Greenberg, associate head coach. "All 
of a sudden he sees all these young guys getting opportunities ahead of him. 
He's never bowed his head. He's hung in and worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
His field-goal shooting percentage is 78 (25 of 32), eye-catching even though 
he never shoots from outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my limitations," said Harvey, who was recruited by former 49ers Coach 
Ron Palmer at a time when the team was losing 20 games a season. "If somebody's 
crowding me, I'm not going to force a bad shot. I do my best work in the paint 
(free-throw lane) because I can jump." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey is known for the heights he reached when leaping for rebounds or lob 
passes, which he converts into two-handed dunks that excite the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 5-10 and dunking in the 10th grade (at Fresno's Edison High School)," he 
said. "They saw me as a crowd-pleaser. Everybody wanted me to dunk, and that 
still goes on today. I have a great assortment of dunks. In a game you normally 
get to do just power dunks, but I would like to get a 360 (degrees) in before 
the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming the father of a daughter two years ago has matured the 22-year-old 
Harvey, his coaches say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's grown up, " Greenberg said. "He realizes his athletic career will come to 
an end soon and he's redefined his priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Told that he is respected by his teammates as a player and a person, Harvey, 
who never lets a day pass without saying something funny, laughed. "I think 
they look at me as a clown," he said. "I'm mature in a way, but I don't want to 
get old too fast. I like having fun." 
</P>
<P>
After college, Harvey may try to play in the Continental Basketball Assn. or in 
Europe. "I'd like to keep playing but I'd also like to start a career," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to write for television, inspired by scriptwriting classes he took 
last semester and a professor who told him he has a creative mind. 
</P>
<P>
Always known as Rudy, he is listed this season in the game programs as Rudolph 
Harvey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"Since elementary school I shied away from that name," he explained. "People 
teased me . . . like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. This year I wanted to give 
my father some respect. He had to live with it, why not me?" 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, a 6-1 guard, has played in only five games this season, averaging 
about 10 minutes. He started 21 games a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I enjoy it," he said in a voice that still bears the stamp of 
the South. "But it's life and you have to deal with it. I'm not going to lose 
my energy focusing on negative things. I practice hard and prepare for the 
games. I just go in and try to do something positive." 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, 23, understands his role, which makes him a coach's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks at himself as a wily old veteran finishing up his career," said 
Greenberg, who, as an assistant coach at the University of Miami (Fla.), 
recruited Faulkner. "He has the experience and the attitude. He puts the team 
in front of himself." 
</P>
<P>
As matter-of-factly as Harvey says he can jump, Faulkner says he can shoot. He 
is hitting 52% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I get in a game, I hear the other coaches say, 'Watch 15,' " 
Faulkner said. "I feel like I'm in the park. I've never been intimidated 
playing. I enjoy playing too much to be nervous. The only time I remember being 
nervous was when I was in the 10th grade. I choked shooting a free throw." 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner, who came to Long Beach because he was dissatisfied with his role on 
the court at South Alabama, is the least athletic of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't jump," he said. "I look at (freshmen) Lucious Harris and Byron 
Russell, they never seem to be down," he said. "They're jumping around and 
dunking all the time. I'm very enthusiastic, but I don't express myself like 
that. I haven't dunked since the 10th grade." 
</P>
<P>
Although quiet, Faulkner is admired by his teammates as much as Tyrone 
Mitchell, the vocal star point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I look up to him," said 19-year-old Frankie Edwards. "He reminds me of my 
family. He doesn't say much, but he shows he cares. I love him." 
</P>
<P>
It is in the classroom where Faulkner does most of his scoring. Last semester, 
his grade point average was a perfect 4, and his overall GPA is 3.3. "I like 
knocking down a long jumper, but an A lasts a lot longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The last of nine children -- he has four brothers and four sisters -- Faulkner 
graduated fifth in a class of 440 at Hamilton High School in Memphis. "Quite a 
few years of perfect attendance," he recalled, crediting the insistent nature 
of his mother, Eunice. 
</P>
<P>
A black studies major, Faulkner approaches schoolwork with a seriousness that 
usually is unexpected in athletes. During final examinations in December, he 
missed the team's flight to Austin, Tex., for a game with the University of 
Texas because he overslept after studying late for a test in abnormal 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what stress was until I took that class," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Multifaceted, Faulkner seems to overflow with ideas and ambitions. "There's 
always something I'm striving for," he said. "If you don't, you might as well 
be dead." 
</P>
<P>
He expects to attend law school when he graduates. He is writing a novel whose 
hero is the sports attorney he hopes to become. And music remains a passion. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in church so I was always around music," he said. He has played the 
piano since Reginald Hunt, who lived on his street, first taught him how to 
play Lionel Richie's "Easy." 
</P>
<P>
He also plays the saxophone, sings and has written more than 50 songs. "One 
reason I came out here was because maybe I'd bump into Quincy Jones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his diverse interests, it will, as with Harvey, be hard to let go of 
basketball, and Faulkner does not intend to. He smiled, thinking how he will 
regain his starting role as an intramural star at law school. 
</P>
<P>
"Average about 40," he said.

POINT GUARD KEY TO LYNWOOD GIRLS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things are fine with the Lynwood High School girls basketball team, now that 
the star point guard is playing to the coach's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
LaShanna Wells, an all-league senior, is averaging 6 points, 4.5 assists and 3 
steals a game for the Knights, who are 14-1 and ranked second behind 
Morningside in the CIF Southern Section's 5-AA Division. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's on her game and paying attention, we can beat anybody," Coach 
Maurice Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wells, daughter of Lynwood councilwoman and former mayor Evelyn Wells, was 
not on her game Dec. 12 when Lynwood suffered its only loss, 62-48, to 
Washington High of Los Angeles. Roberson benched her after the first quarter 
and for a subsequent game. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't moving the ball to the proper players," Roberson said. "She said, 
'Well, they don't listen.' I said, 'No, if you do what I tell you, they'll 
listen.' I could have kicked her off the team but you've got to take and give 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood team went to Seattle the week after Christmas and won the Rainier 
Beach Magic Shootout, which drew some of the top teams in the Pacific 
Northwest. It was the first time most of the players, who raised money for the 
trip by holding a fashion show and fish fry, had been out of California. "It 
just blew their minds," Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights won four games in the tournament, including the championship game, 
56-50, against Rainier Beach High, which had not lost in its gym in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Watson, a 5-foot-10 guard who has signed with USC, is the Knights' 
leading scorer, averaging 19 points a game. She has made 32 three-point shots 
this season and more than 130 in her career. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Barfield, a 5-foot-10 junior rebounding forward, is averaging 15 points a 
game, and senior guard Nicole Sanders is averaging 14. Sanders will be the 
first girl to play basketball at Cal Poly Pomona and also be in the engineering 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Roberson, 56, is in his second year as Lynwood coach. 
</P>
<P>
How the 49ers Rank: The Cal State Long Beach men's basketball team, with a 9-2 
record, is 28th in The Sporting News' Top 40 rankings this week and 51st in USA 
Today's computer ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers play tonight at UC Irvine and Saturday night at UC Santa Barbara. 
They play New Mexico State in the campus gym Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers women's team, 10-2 and ninth in the Associated Press poll, defeated 
Cal State Fullerton, 92-62, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
From Bell Gardens to Big Time: Bell Gardens High School, despite its great 
success in football the last decade, has had only one graduate, Dionicio 
Monarrez, who has gone on to play at a major college. Monarrez just completed 
his senior season as a nose guard at the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, offensive tackle Bob Robertson, 23, another Bell Gardens 
alumnus, signed to play for Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"Dionicio was kind of like ol' Bob's mentor," said Bell Gardens Coach Dave 
Newell. 
</P>
<P>
They followed similar paths. After leaving high school in 1979, Monarrez was in 
the Army for three years before playing two seasons at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who is 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, graduated from Bell Gardens in 1983 
and served three years in the Marine Corps before playing at Cerritos the last 
two seasons. At Cerritos he was an honorable mention All-American. 
</P>
<P>
They Couldn't Throw It in the Ocean: Whitney High School of Cerritos made only 
six of 44 field-goal attempts (13.6%) in losing to Brethren, 54-20, Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia's Big Game: Artesia High School, top-ranked in CIF Division 4-A, will 
play one of its biggest games in years Friday night when it meets powerful 
Mater Dei, the No. 1 team in 5-A. The game will be at 7 in the Cal State Long 
Beach gym and televised on the SportsChannel. "The student body and the 
community are really excited about playing them," said Artesia Coach Wayne 
Merino. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a large crowd, the game was scheduled for the Long Beach 
gym, which seats about 2,000, 700 more than Artesia High's gym. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect it will be packed, Merino said. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, 15-1 this season, defeated the Pioneers last year, 76-48. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia, 11-1 before Wednesday night's game against Glenn, is led by 6-foot-9 
All-American Ed O'Bannon, who is averaging 26 points and 9 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more mature this year," said Merino. "He has improved his vocal 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon is expected to decide in April whether he will play at Arizona State, 
Nevada Las Vegas, LSU, Syracuse, UCLA or USC. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier College Names Coach: Don Uyeshima, 40, has received a one-year 
appointment as football coach at Whittier College, replacing Hugh Mendez, who 
resigned after 10 years with a 53-46 record. 
</P>
<P>
Uyeshima, a linebacker for the Poets in the early 1970s, was an assistant at 
Whittier the last eight seasons and has been teaching at La Puente High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew into this," Uyeshima said. "When Hugh resigned, I felt there was a lot 
of work left undone." 
</P>
<P>
The Poets have had three consecutive 3-6 seasons.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN FATAL HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man accused of causing a fatal accident and running away has pleaded 
not guilty to vehicular manslaughter and felony hit-and-run. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Jorge Ayala, 20, could face seven years in prison if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Juan Ayala, 53, pleaded not guilty to charges of being an accessory 
after the accident. If convicted, the elder Ayala could be sentenced to up to 
three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Jorge Ayala on Jan. 3 sped through a stop sign at East Elk 
Avenue and Everett Street and crashed into a car, killing its driver and 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Karapet Khajehtorians, 57, was pronounced dead at the scene. His daughter, 
Janice, 22, was pronounced dead on arrival at Glendale Adventist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Ayala told investigators that the car had been stolen earlier. But, 
witnesses said, they saw Jorge flee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 16. Both men are in custody with 
bail set at $50,000.

FAMILY LIFE: DEALING WITH VET LEAVES HIM, HIS WALLET AS NERVOUS AS KITTENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If members of your family tell you they're sick as a dog, you'd best pray it 
isn't so. 
</P>
<P>
Or, anyway, not as sick as a cat. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least not as sick as one of our cats was over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
This animal, whose name I'm not even sure of, became uncharacteristically 
lethargic a few days after Christmas, exhibiting little interest in eating, or 
much of anything else. 
</P>
<P>
What he did eat reappeared in odd areas of the house, leading to a great deal 
of concern among the kids, particularly in my older son, who wasn't feeling 
well himself. 
</P>
<P>
It became obvious that both my son and the cat needed medical attention, so I 
made appointments with our family doctor and with the vet. 
</P>
<P>
The family doctor diagnosed my son as having a severe case of laryngitis and 
prescribed antibiotics and lots of rest. 
</P>
<P>
The vet was much more ominous in his diagnosis, warning about an AIDS-like 
virus sweeping the feline world and asking questions about the cat's personal 
life -- intimate items that what's-his-name certainly has never shared with me. 
I mean, the truth is I barely know him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had better keep him for a few days and hope for the best," he said. "I'll 
have to do some tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the regular lab isn't open New Year's Day, so I'll have to 
personally run the blood samples and stuff over to the emergency lab. 
</P>
<P>
"Which I'm happy to do." 
</P>
<P>
My wallet did a little involuntary jump. 
</P>
<P>
I waited until the kids were out of the room and asked something I would never 
ask about their care, especially in an emergency situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, can you give me some kind of estimate?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well," he replied, obviously not understanding the question, "if all the tests 
are negative and we're talking about just an intestinal disorder, I would hope 
we can have him home in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if it's something more serious. . . ." He sighed, and suddenly 
looked very helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just cross that bridge when we come to it. Let's try to be positive, 
shall we?" 
</P>
<P>
He apparently had misinterpreted the little beads of perspiration that had 
appeared on my upper lip, so I tried a more direct approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, I don't want to sound uncaring or indelicate, but in terms of cost, uh, 
could you give me some idea, uh, of. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He stared out the window for a few minutes (possibly, but I can't be absolutely 
sure, to determine what kind of car I was driving). 
</P>
<P>
"Well, at this point, of course, it's hard to say, but if you'd like, I could 
do some figuring." 
</P>
<P>
He left the room for a few minutes and reappeared with a piece of paper he 
handed the receptionist, who then spent an inordinate amount of time with her 
calculator. 
</P>
<P>
She handed me a yellow printed sheet with items checked -- "fecal flotation," 
"blood test," "medications" and "in-patient accomd.," among others. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line -- actually, the third from the bottom line -- was somewhere 
between $135 and $360, or what used to be a down payment on a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
"You will keep me informed at each stage of his treatment?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, why?" he replied, raising his eyebrows slightly, as if he expected me to 
say something like, "Well, when you get to $200. . . ." and then yank my tie 
straight up, jerk my neck to the side, cross my eyes and make a gagging sound. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I repeated his suggestion that we cross that bridge when we get to it. 
</P>
<P>
He called two days later. "Good news," he said. "Your cat only has an 
intestinal infection and he can go home Tuesday morning." 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is the cat is fine now, or as fine as $192 can make a cat. My son is 
better, also. His bill was $35, plus $16 for some antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
There's probably a message there somewhere, but I'm not sure I'm in the mood to 
go into it. At least not right now. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, after all, we are talking about a cat here, although I have to admit 
that he's changed since his illness and become something he never was before. 
</P>
<P>
Valuable.

RESEARCH LINKS ENZYME TO ALCOHOL'S EFFECT ON WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major advance toward understanding why women are more vulnerable to the 
effects of alcohol than men, researchers reported today that women appear to 
have significantly lower amounts of a stomach enzyme that breaks down some of 
the intoxicant before it circulates through the body. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by researchers from the University School of Medicine in Trieste, 
Italy, and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, N.Y., also may help 
explain why women who drink heavily suffer more liver damage than men and why 
consumption of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can cause serious 
birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
If the results are confirmed in other studies, health and government officials 
may need to consider sex differences when defining safe levels of drinking for 
driving motor vehicles and other activities that demand high degrees of 
attention or coordination. 
</P>
<P>
"The stomach represents a protective barrier against the penetration of alcohol 
into the body," said Dr. Charles S. Lieber, director of the Alcohol Research 
and Treatment Center at the Bronx center and the senior author of the study, 
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The study of 20 men and 23 women shows "that the stomach plays a significant 
(protective) role in the metabolism of alcohol in men and a less significant 
and perhaps even negligible role in women," said Dr. Albert L. Jones, a liver 
and metabolism expert at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if differences in body weight are taken into account, a woman 
might become legally intoxicated after consuming 20% to 30% less alcohol than a 
man, Lieber said. If weight differences are not considered, an average-size 
woman might reach a given blood alcohol level after consuming about 50% less 
alcohol than a man. 
</P>
<P>
For years, physicians have considered the liver the primary organ in the body 
for degrading the alcohol that enters the bloodstream. It also has been known 
that women have higher blood alcohol concentrations than men after drinking 
equivalent amounts of liquor and that alcoholic liver disease, such as 
cirrhosis, develops more readily in women than in men. 
</P>
<P>
The greater susceptibility of women than men to the effects of a drink was 
usually explained by citing the smaller size of many women and a smaller volume 
of distribution of alcohol, because women's bodies have relatively more fat and 
less water than men's. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings draw attention to an overlooked role for the lining of the 
stomach in reducing the amount of alcohol that enters the circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Steven Schenker of the University of Texas in San Antonio, said, "We are 
dealing essentially with new territory. . . . That is why this is exciting." 
Schenker was the co-author of a New England Journal editorial on the study. The 
editorial called for further study, cautioning that "firm proof" of the 
decreased protective role of the stomach in women "is lacking and other factors 
may be operative." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Bronx reseachers found that the stomach lining of men 
contains an enzyme called gastric alcohol dehydrogenase which breaks down 
alcohol. They then decided to investigate possible sex-related differences in 
the amount of this enzyme in the body and the effects on the enzyme of heavy 
alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 non-alcoholic men, six alcoholic men, 17 non-alcoholic women and six 
alcoholic women in the study were examined in two ways -- measurement of blood 
alcohol concentrations and laboratory measurement of the alcohol dehydrogenase 
enzyme. All the subjects were Italians and none of the women were taking birth 
control pills, which might have influenced the results. 
</P>
<P>
Lieber said the next steps were performance of similar studies on men and women 
of various ages, and racial and ethnic groups, as well as consideration of the 
potential effects of drugs and sex hormones, such as birth control pills, on 
the stomach's protective barrier against the penetration of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In 37 participants, blood alcohol concentrations were carefully determined 
after administering both oral and intravenous doses of ethanol. The doses were 
adjusted for variations in body weight; they were comparable to the amount of 
alcohol in about 1 1/2 drinks and were given one hour after a "standard" 
breakfast was eaten. (One drink is usually defined as a 12-ounce beer, a 
four-ounce glass of wine or a 1 1/2-ounce shot of 80 proof liquor.) 
</P>
<P>
"In both the non-alcoholic and alcoholic groups, women had higher blood ethanol 
concentrations than men after ingesting an equivalent (weight-adjusted) dose of 
ethanol," the report said. In contrast, there were no significant sex-related 
differences when the ethanol was given intravenously, thereby bypassing the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
After oral ingestions, the alcoholic men had significantly higher blood ethanol 
concentrations than the non-alcoholic men. In the alcoholic women, the blood 
ethanol concentrations were even higher, almost identical to the values 
achieved after the intravenous ethanol doses, suggesting a total lack of 
protection by the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholism results in a "decrease" of the stomach's protective barrier against 
alcohol, Lieber said, perhaps explaining the mechanism by which heavy drinkers 
are at greater risk for liver damage and other alcohol-related health problems. 
He added: "Alcoholic women have a total loss of this gastric protective 
mechanism. For an alcoholic woman to drink alcohol is the same thing as taking 
the same amount of alcohol intravenously." 
</P>
<P>
In 38 participants, specimens of apparently normal areas of the stomach lining 
were obtained, usually by endoscopy, a procedure in which a fiberoptic-lighted 
tube is inserted into the stomach through the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The activity of the gastric alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme was then measured in 
the laboratory. The enzyme's activities were "70 to 80% higher in the 
non-alcoholic men than in the non-alcoholic women," and considerably lower in 
alcoholics than non-alcoholics, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recommend to the public moderation in drinking, what we should really 
do is introduce a gender factor," Lieber said in a telephone interview. "The 
amount that is moderate in men is not moderate in women." Lieber said the study 
results were "an additional reason" for pregnant women to abstain from 
drinking.

IN PRAGUE, IT'S POLITICS WITH A 'HAPPY FACE'

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the symbol of the Romanian revolution is the national flag with a hole where 
the Communist emblem has been ripped away, the symbol of Czechoslovakia's 
political transformation is a "happy face." 
</P>
<P>
It comes from the stylized initials in Czech for Civic Forum, the popular 
movement that rose from nothing to overthrow the hard-line Communist regime 
last year in a matter of days. The name in Czech is Obcanske Forum, and the "O" 
is rendered with eyes and a smiling mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first of the year, the symbol has spread well beyond the 
organization. The date often appears with a happy face in place of the zero in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The happy face serves as a reminder of the extraordinary influence wielded by 
Civic Forum, and the relative optimism with which most political analysts view 
Czechoslovakia's prospects for what may be the least painful transition to 
democracy in the old Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with June 8 proposed as the date for Czechoslovakia's first free 
national elections in more than 40 years, the euphoric smile of victory is 
increasingly appearing together with the calculated smile of a political 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The day for the elections, according to a government spokesman, may be 
confirmed at today's session of the so-called round table, the gathering of 
representatives of Czechoslovakia's main political forces. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources, who take part regularly in these talks, said that a complicated 
formula involving different electoral procedures for each house of a 
restructured, bicameral legislature has been proposed. They said the present 
legislature is expected to rubber-stamp whatever formula is agreed to at the 
round table. 
</P>
<P>
Under this proposal, there would be a people's chamber made up of about 10 
representatives from each of a dozen electoral districts. The parties would put 
up regional lists of candidates, with the distribution of seats based on the 
share of the popular vote received by each party or coalition of parties. 
</P>
<P>
There would be a second chamber made up of people elected as individuals. A 
simple majority of votes cast would decide the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Palous, a member of Civic Forum's inner circle, said that although the 
group is not a political party, it will make it clear which candidates it 
supports, including independents. 
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted by the Sociological Institute of the Czechoslovak 
Academy of Sciences and published this week by the Socialist Party newspaper, 
the biggest single bloc of voters is undecided. Nearly 21% said they do not 
know which party they will support, and 16% said they are not sure -- but will 
definitely not vote for the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party polled 14.4% in the poll, compared to 12.1% for Civic 
Forum. The results are misleading, because Civic Forum is an umbrella 
organization for supporters of a wide variety of non-Communist political 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Polling in Prague 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Hynek Jerabek said Wednesday in an interview that the survey, 
conducted in the second half of December, included 652 randomly selected 
individuals in 53 provincial towns and villages. There was no polling in 
Prague, where Civic Forum's strength is greatest, and in a number of villages, 
respondents were not aware that Civic Forum plans to endorse candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak Socialist Party, which polled 12.7% in the Sociological 
Institute study, and the Peoples' Party, mostly Roman Catholic, which polled 
6.7%, both supported Civic Forum in its drive to oust the Communists, and both 
are represented in the interim coalition government. Social Democrats, Greens 
and other small parties, many of which also support Civic Forum, polled a 
collective 17.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Czechs and Slovaks continue to organize themselves into new 
political and social groups so rapidly that Western diplomats say they have 
given up trying to keep track of them. 
</P>
<P>
This week's additions included the Buddhist Society of Czechoslovakia and the 
Neutrality Party, which proposes to minimize the army and model 
Czechoslovakia's foreign relations on Switzerland's. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of Communist protocol, such as addressing the president, Cabinet 
ministers and military officers as "comrade," have been relegated to the trash 
heap. The youth daily Mlada Fronta (Young Front) reported Wednesday that 
students in some schools have been forced as punishment to write 100 times, "I 
will not address the teacher as 'comrade.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police officers, feared agents of the old regime, are now noticeably absent 
from the streets of Prague -- clearly a move to eliminate what could be a 
public irritant. "It's almost as if they were on strike," a taxi driver 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
While other East European countries forecast enormous unemployment as their 
inefficient, planned economies are put on a market basis, Czechoslovak 
television is advertising free daily transportation to anyone willing to work 
at the Skoda automobile plant in Mlada Boleslav. The Skoda work force, made up 
in part by convicts, was decimated by a New Year amnesty under which 23,260 
prison inmates have already been freed. 
</P>
<P>
The interim government established last month has already devalued the 
Czechoslovak currency by about 80%; other inevitable austerity moves may be put 
off until after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum's domination of the political scene may not show up in the polls, 
but it is clear in other ways. As a Western diplomat put it: "If you really 
want to get something, you don't go to a government office -- you go to Civic 
Forum, and then you get a call from the ministry." 
</P>
<P>
When a Canadian dignitary visited Prague recently, all his appointments, 
including a talk with the Communist prime minister, Marian Calfa, were arranged 
through Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The movement's original leadership, whose televised features became familiar to 
viewers around the world, has been transformed by success. 
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who formed Civic Forum last November, 
moved out of his second-floor offices in the group's central headquarters this 
week. He was named president of Czechoslovakia last month, and he now conducts 
business from Hradcany Castle, the official residence of the head of state. 
</P>
<P>
Jiri Dienstbier, a former spokesman for the movement, is now foreign minister, 
and three other leaders also have Cabinet portfolios. A woman who was the 
translator at the movement's early press conferences has been nominated as 
ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was reorganized last weekend with the aim 
of shedding its Stalinist image and becoming a more modern, if still leftist, 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Vasil Mohorita, first secretary of the party's restructured executive body, 
said it has lost about 140,000 of its 1.7 million members, and other party 
sources said it is expecting to lose as many as 400,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
Mohorita and Ladislav Adamec, the party chairman, warned that the party, which 
ruled unchallenged for more than 40 years, now seems likely to wind up in the 
opposition after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Havel Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Communists are not giving up. They have been trying to make 
electoral capital out of a couple of controversial actions by President Havel. 
</P>
<P>
One was a suggestion in a pre-Christmas speech that Czechoslovakia should 
publicly apologize to Sudeten Germans who were treated brutally during their 
expulsion from the country after World War II. The remark stirred up resentment 
among those who feel that Nazi Germany committed far greater crimes against 
Czechoslovakia, and the Communist Party newspaper led the attack on Havel. 
</P>
<P>
The party has also tried to capitalize on fears that Havel's amnesty, which 
covers an estimated 30,000 prisoners, will lead to a crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves were in character for Havel, who has championed a high standard of 
public morality through 20 years of political dissidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the average Czechoslovak didn't have the same moral strength he has 
shown, the response to him shows that this upright behavior really strikes a 
chord here," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that Havel "is learning very quickly that speaking with a pure 
moral voice in the day-to-day politics of a pre-election period can be fraught 
with difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat said the biggest danger he sees is that Civic Forum will be 
corrupted by its power and will use it to forestall the introduction of real 
political pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it avoidable?" the diplomat said. "I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded, however, that Czechoslovakia has perhaps the strongest prewar 
democratic traditions of any of the East European nations trying to break with 
the past. And Civic Forum, he added, has "managed until now quite 
fantastically."

COMPROMISE ON ETHICS REFORMS IS ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several key City Council members and the head of the mayor's ethics commission 
announced a compromise Wednesday on a sweeping package of ethics reforms that 
would restrict outside income for public officials and would establish publicly 
financed elections. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise was reached after weeks of rancorous public debate and private 
arm-twisting, and comes just days before the council's self-imposed deadline 
for passing ethics reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The council is attempting to head off a threatened citizens' initiative that 
would embrace the wide-ranging recommendations of an ethics-in-government 
commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley a day after his narrow election 
victory last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hammered out by Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the 
council's Ad Hoc Committee on Ethics, and Geoffrey Cowan, chairman of the 
mayor's commission. If the council approves the agreement substantially intact, 
there will be no citizens' initiative on the ballot, Cowan said at a press 
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the compromise, Cowan backed away from a demand for a total ban on outside 
earned income for public officials. Instead, public officials would be 
prohibited only from doing work for firms that are located in or do business 
with the city of Los Angeles. Work for other firms would be permitted with 
prior permission from a new city ethics commission, which would rule on 
possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The outside work ban would apply to about 1,500 of the city's 45,000 employees. 
While elected officials and top policy makers would have to get permission from 
the five-member ethics commission for outside employment, others would have to 
get the approval of their department heads. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise also provided a higher level of public financing for political 
campaigns. The mayor's commission had proposed matching funds generally equal 
to one-third of a candidate's total contributions. However, Woo prevailed in 
getting the amount raised to one-half. The matching funds would be paid from 
the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
In return for accepting the public funds, City Council candidates would have to 
limit their spending to $400,000 per race. Mayoral and other citywide 
candidates who accept the matching funds would face a $2-million expenditure 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Spending limits "dramatically reduce influence of special interests," Cowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the city of providing matching funds has not yet been calculated, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo called the package "the toughest, most comprehensive code of government 
ethics in the nation," and said he is now "much more confident that this 
package can win the support of the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
The package was also endorsed Wednesday by City Council President John Ferraro 
and Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the measure now has the support of "council leadership," but the 
15-member body is a loosely organized group with frequently shifting 
coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have said privately that they would support the package -- 
and its restrictions on outside income -- in return for a substantial pay 
raise. The most frequently mentioned figures would link pay for council 
members, who now get $61,522 a year, to that of Municipal Court judges, who get 
about $80,000 a year. A pay-raise proposal also would include an increase for 
the mayor, who is paid $102,537. 
</P>
<P>
However, Woo, who has been aggressively lobbying his fellow council members for 
the last week to win their support for the package, said that the pay raise and 
the ethics package are not linked and no pay raise has been formally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Wednesday whether other members of the council, who are widely 
divided on the issue, will endorse the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"That's only three votes -- maybe," said one council member who asked not to be 
named. He predicted that the package may undergo substantial changes on the 
council floor. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a vocal critic of some aspects of the 
reform, could not be persuaded to attend the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the provisions contained in the lengthy package must be approved by the 
voters. Woo said Wednesday at least two separate measures probably will be on 
the June ballot, one dealing with ethics provisions and the other with public 
campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
The package is scheduled for a vote in the council's ethics committee today. By 
heading off the citizens' initiative, the council was able to maintain control 
of the details of the ethics regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was not invited to the press conference Wednesday, but aides said he 
had been kept apprised of the negotiations. In a written statement, Bradley 
said he was pleased with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful the City Council can act by Feb. 12 in order to get this ethics 
package before the voters on the June ballot," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also would bar public officials from accepting honoraria, free 
trips and most gifts from persons other than relatives. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly controversial section is the "revolving door" provision, which 
bars elected officials and other top policy-makers from lobbying any city 
department for a year after they leave office or quit their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members have been skittish about speaking out publicly against the 
ethics package, but some said privately Wednesday that chances of the measure 
passing as-is are slim.

REPORT CLAIMS IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT HAS LED TO BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION: FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING COMMISSION ACCUSES INS OF 
INEFFECTIVELY ENFORCING EMPLOYER-SANCTIONS PROVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report hailed by Latino activists and civil libertarians, a California 
agency that monitors civil rights abuses has concluded that the landmark 1986 
immigration reform law has led to widespread discrimination against hundreds of 
thousands of U.S.-born and foreign-looking persons seeking work. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission, scheduled for 
release today, accused the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service of 
ineffectively enforcing the law's employer-sanctions provision, giving many 
employers carte blanche to turn away job applicants even though many of them 
had proof of U.S. residency. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member commission recommended that the INS suspend enforcement of the 
employer sanctions, which call for fines up to $10,000 for those who knowingly 
hire illegal immigrants. The moratorium would allow the INS to eliminate 
backlogs of paper work that in the past has slowed the agency's processing of a 
immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
The non-binding recommendations are the first by a public agency in the Western 
United States on the controversial Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), 
under which more than 3 million aliens applied for amnesty. More than half of 
those live in California. A similar report was issued by a New York state 
agency in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The report comes at a time when the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, is preparing a final report on the effects of 
the reform law and its various provisions. 
</P>
<P>
If the GAO agrees that discrimination has occurred, Congress is required under 
the act to consider changes. But most observers believe Congress may be 
hesitant to make such changes because of the emotionally charged debate that 
ensues any time the issue of immigration surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, comprised of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian appointees, is 
responsible for enforcing California laws prohibiting discrimination in housing 
and employment. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission did not call for repeal of employer fines, its findings 
overjoyed Latinos and immigrants' advocates who opposed the law because the 
findings validated fears of discrimination that were expressed in the debate 
leading up to the law's passage in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I predicted that would happen," said Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles), who 
voted against the law, "but no one at the time seemed to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials predictably defended their performance in carrying out the 
provision, pointing out that the agency spent millions of dollars and thousands 
of hours of staff time to get out the word about it as well as the amnesty 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
"The INS has done an excellent job of implementing this law," agency spokesman 
Virginia Kice said. "I don't think anyone can classify employer sanctions or 
IRCA as a failure." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's findings were based on testimony given at a series of public 
hearings held last year in Oakland, Fresno and Los Angeles to assess the law's 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, the commission concluded that widespread discrimination occurred 
because many employers were confused about the law's requirements. In some 
instances, the report said, INS efforts to educate employers turned out to be 
visits to find incriminating evidence in order to fine guilty employers. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that employers' fears of sanctions, and confusion and 
misinformation about IRCA's requirements, coupled with a tremendous 
administrative backlog at the INS, have resulted in a widespread pattern and 
practice of discrimination based on national origin and citizenship status," 
the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Other testimony heard by the commission included: 
</P>
<P>
* Several immigrant-rights attorneys told of many employers refusing jobs to 
"foreign-looking workers" although they appeared to have documents proving 
legal authority to work in this country. When pressed about this, the lawyers 
reported some of the employers as saying they didn't want to bother with 
non-Anglo looking people because of the law. 
</P>
<P>
* Executives with Levi-Strauss Co. in San Francisco said they had to rewrite 
many INS pamphlets because they were largely unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
* Several small-business employers, including one Los Angeles-area trucking 
executive, complained that the INS selectively enforced the sanctions 
provisions. The Los Angeles executive, Ronald Ravana, said he was fined about 
$8,000 for failing to completely fill out documents on each new hire. Many of 
the violations, he said, had to do with failing to fill out two separate spaces 
asking for the worker's Social Security number.

BLASTS RIP DESERT SOLAR POWER PLANT

<P>
A series of explosions and fire shut down electricity generation at the world's 
largest solar power plant near here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thick plumes of black smoke spiraled into the clear desert air when one of four 
natural gas-fired heaters used to back up the solar heating system exploded. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, a second natural gas heater caught fire and exploded as the 
first of 75 firefighters and 25 pieces of equipment were arriving at the site, 
about 140 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a series of explosions, more than two," said Capt. Sharon Sellers of 
the San Bernardino County Fire Department. "Our first units got on-scene at 
9:16 a.m. and a second explosion occurred at that point, then a series of them 
during the entire incident," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a mushroom cloud. The heat was real intense and there were 
explosions," said an inmate from the Boron Federal Prison Camp who was pressed 
into service to help fight the fire. He would not identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said two workers at the plant suffered minor breathing problems and 
were treated at Barstow Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Operated by LUZ International Ltd. of Los Angeles, the $280-million Harper Lake 
solar plant began generating electricity on Dec. 28 and produces 80 megawatts, 
enough power to serve 115,000 people. The company operates eight such plants in 
the California desert. Combined, they generate 274 megawatts, which is sold to 
Southern California Edison Co. An Edison spokesman said there was no 
interruption of electric service to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two oil heaters on line and were bringing up the third and fourth oil 
heaters when this explosion occurred," LUZ International spokeswoman Kathleen 
Flanagan said in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While no flames were visible 1 1/2 hours after the fire began shortly before 9 
a.m., San Bernardino County firefighters had difficulty reaching the blaze deep 
within the generating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is fire up there somewhere still heating that oil," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained, but continued to burn late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire was unknown, but fire officials ruled out arson and said it 
probably resulted from an equipment malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
While Flanagan said she could not immediately estimate the cost of the blaze, 
the Fire Department said a single natural gas heater costs $500,000. One was 
destroyed and a second was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the black smoke from an estimated 15,000 gallons of burning 
synthetic oil was not any more toxic than smoke from natural crude or refined 
oil and was not carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
But that report was disputed by Capt. Clyde Gamma of the California Department 
of Forestry and Fire Protection. He identified the synthetic oil as Therminol 
and said it is cancer-causing. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the plant could resume generating electricity by Monday. But she 
said the backup natural gas-fired heaters would not be used. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be operating strictly in the solar mode," she said. For solar 
generation, large curved mirrors are used to concentrate the sun's energy onto 
synthetic oil, which flows through an insulated steel pipe. The hot oil boils 
water into steam that drives conventional electrical turbines. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said LUZ International had a fire about two years ago at another solar 
plant at Daggett and that explosions continued five hours into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Stammer reported from Los Angeles and Harris from Barstow.

STATE JUMPS INTO CALAVERAS' FRAY ON GOLIATH FROGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
State fish and game wardens Wednesday hopped into the fight over a Seattle 
man's plan to enter eight-pound Goliath frogs in Calaveras County's whimsical 
frog-jumping contest, saying the African amphibians are not welcome in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The policy flip-flop -- contest organizers said game wardens originally said 
the frogs could legally be brought into the state for display -- came after 
some wardens expressed fears that the giant, sharp-toothed frogs might run amok 
in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some real concerns about the frogs getting loose and negatively 
impacting the environment," said spokesman Lanny Clavecilla of the California 
Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento. "Such exotic, or non-native, frogs 
are prohibited and undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not entirely prohibited and undesirable. Clavecilla said the decision to 
ban the huge frogs from being brought into the state for the Calaveras 
competition -- made famous in a Mark Twain short story -- does not mean 
researchers and zoos will have to surrender their own Goliaths. 
</P>
<P>
"It is OK (to import them) for scientific research or agricultural purposes" -- 
that is, frog ranching to satisfy frog's leg lovers -- "but frog-jumping 
contests are another matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The concern about the Goliaths is that should they escape from the contest, 
they will terrorize local populations of small fish and insects, which make up 
their diet. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears about the Goliaths are unwarranted, said Andy J. Koffman, the exotic 
animal exporter who sparked the controversy. The frogs are difficult to keep 
alive beyond the warm, humid climate of their native habitat and would not 
survive long in the semi-arid central Sierra Nevada region, he said Wednesday 
from his Seattle home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Mr. Koffman is wrong," said fish and game biologist Steven 
Taylor. "But I'm not willing to concede he is correct, either. We can only 
permit importation (of the frogs) if it can clearly be demonstrated the action 
will have no harmful effect. The burden of proof is on the importer, and he 
hasn't done that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Koffman's pledge to enter his Goliaths in the frog-jumping contest created a 
stir because it was assumed that they would easily defeat the much smaller 
California bullfrogs that normally compete. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Baumann of the 39th District Agricultural Assn. -- which conducts the 
frog-jumping contest as part of the mid-May Calaveras County Fair -- said the 
fair's board of directors is still scheduled to meet in executive session 
Friday to decide whether to rewrite the rules to accommodate -- or eliminate -- 
the Goliaths. 
</P>
<P>
Koffman is unruffled. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am not creating a real menace, it always works out in the end," 
he said. "I'm sure I'll jump my frogs at Calaveras." 
</P>
<P>
He's also fairly confident that the contest won't be their first experience in 
California. Koffman and his amphibians have been asked to appear this week on 
"The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson" -- in Burbank.

U.S. URGING PANAMA TO ESTABLISH ANTI-NARCOTICS POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG WAR: WASHINGTON ALSO SEEKS NEW BANKING REGULATIONS TO CURB FLOW OF ILLICIT 
FUNDS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has begun delicate talks with the Panamanian government in 
hopes of persuading its leaders to create an anti-narcotics police force and to 
implement new restrictions on banking in order to consolidate gains in the war 
on drugs won with the ouster of Manuel A. Noriega, according to U.S. and 
Panamanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of good faith, a senior State Department official announced here 
Wednesday that the Bush Administration plans to move with unprecedented haste 
to formally certify that Panama is cooperating with the United States on 
anti-drug matters. Such a move would thereby restore trade benefits cut off by 
Congress to punish the Noriega regime for its reputed sponsorship of 
international drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the discussions said that new President Guillermo 
Endara and acting Atty. Gen. Ricardo Arias Calderon reacted with "some 
sensitivity" to the proposals by Assistant Secretary of State Melvyn R. 
Levitsky on banking and law enforcement, which would require reforms in two 
Panamanian institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for further safeguards against a resumption of drug-related 
activities here comes as U.S. officials, in a softening of earlier 
pronouncements, acknowledged that the removal of Noriega was, by itself, likely 
to have only minimal impact on the flow of cocaine to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that even under Noriega, who is facing trial in the United 
States on drug trafficking charges, Panama played only an insignificant role as 
a transit point for cocaine shipments on their way north from South America. 
Although Panamanian banks were favored repositories for illicit drug profits, 
even that money-laundering role appears to have diminished in the last two 
years because of the weak economy here, they said. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of the more sober assessment of the extent of the Noriega 
regime's direct participation in drug trafficking came as the State Department 
anti-narcotics chief sought to explain what would be different about the new 
Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a question of attitude," he said. "The message from this 
government (to drug traffickers) is: 'Hands off Panama. Don't come here.' " 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults 
described cocaine trafficking through Panama under Noriega as a "minor matter." 
A reduction in shipments as a result of the strongman's ouster alone "is not 
going to happen," he warned bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that the removal of Noriega could nevertheless provide a 
major benefit to the drug war by depriving drug traffickers of the haven they 
once enjoyed, and by opening the way for vigorous enforcement of drug laws by 
the new Endara regime. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior U.S. official with expertise in drug matters also emphasized the 
need to consolidate that gain through persuading the Endara government to 
introduce new anti-drug reforms that might bring about tangible achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The changes being encouraged by the United States, which would primarily affect 
the banking and law enforcement systems, are designed to reform institutions 
whose characteristics offer an enduring opportunity for drug traffickers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because drug enforcement remains the responsibility of a joint military-police 
organization dominated by former members of the pro-Noriega Panama Defense 
Forces, the prospect that those forces might prove lax in cracking down on 
narcotics operations remains a "major concern," the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, State Department anti-narcotics chief Levitsky is said to 
have urged Endara and other officials in private meetings Tuesday and Wednesday 
to establish a separate anti-drug force "well insulated" from the taint of PDF 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
On banking, where secrecy laws continue to make Panamanian banks prospective 
storage places for illicit cash, the U.S. envoy urged the Panamanians to 
approve regulations that would require bank executives to report large or 
suspicious transactions to authorities, according to sources with knowledge of 
the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Such a restriction could well diminish the attraction of Panama as a banking 
center, even to some depositors who acquired their funds legally -- and on that 
basis it was greeted coldly by the new Panamanian leaders, the sources said. 
But the American representatives held out hope that pressure from the United 
States might persuade the Panamanians to accept additional restrictions because 
"they don't want to get crosswise with us," according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for the separate reforms in the law enforcement system remained less 
clear, with the Panamanian leadership apparently undecided as to the wisdom of 
going outside the unitary security force to establish a separate anti-drug 
team. 
</P>
<P>
More immediately, the congressional certification would restore to Panama a 
guaranteed share of the U.S. sugar market and would grant most-favored-nation 
status for other Panamanian exports.

DEFENDANT IN NORIEGA DRUG CASE ASKS JUDGE FOR SEPARATE TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, a former Panamanian military officer who has been 
charged with drug trafficking along with Manuel A. Noriega, sought Wednesday to 
distance himself from his deposed commander by asking a federal judge to grant 
him a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
The move came as prosecutors tried to arrange a plea bargain for Del Cid to 
become a star government witness against Noriega, hoping to strengthen a case 
somewhat clouded by legal concerns over disclosure of sensitive government 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The government's prosecution of Noriega is expected to depend heavily on 
testimony from persons who allegedly participated with him in helping 
Colombia's notorious Medellin drug cartel use Panama as a haven for 
transshipping cocaine and laundering drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid filed legal papers objecting that Noriega's anticipated defense is 
antagonistic to his own. While Del Cid plans to contest the charges against him 
as based on "hearsay evidence," Noriega is willing to admit criminal offenses 
on grounds that U.S. intelligence agents condoned them, according to the court 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the intention of defendant Del Cid to seek to engage in 'graymail' 
or entrapment-like defenses implicating agencies of the United States 
government," Samuel I. Burstyn, his attorney, said in his request for a 
severance. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's lawyers have announced they will file formal demands for top-secret 
U.S. records that will illustrate Noriega's role as a confidential informant 
for the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration for many years before 1986. 
Burstyn said the indictment returned in Miami in February, 1988, shows an 
"enormous disparity" between the alleged roles of Del Cid and Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Noriega with 11 counts of smuggling cocaine, laundering 
drug money and protecting cocaine-processing plants in his country. Del Cid 
stands accused in four counts of serving as Noriega's liaison with the cartel 
and acting as a courier for drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors look upon Del Cid as a potential key witness in the government's 
case against Noriega because of his firsthand knowledge of his former 
superior's activities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler took no immediate action on Del Cid's 
request for a severance. The judge is expected to wait until other 
co-defendants have made similar requests before reaching any decisions.

DIPLOMATIC MOVES FOCUS ON CAMBODIA

<P>
With fighting escalating in Cambodia between government troops and three 
guerrilla factions, a flurry of diplomatic moves was reported to be under way 
Wednesday in an effort to settle the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
After four days of denials, the government in Phnom Penh admitted Wednesday 
that guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge faction had attacked four villages on the 
outskirts of Battambang, Cambodia's second-largest city, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge had said that Battambang was set afire in the fighting, but a 
statement issued by the Cambodian government and broadcast by Phnom Penh radio 
said that between 100 and 200 Khmer Rouge guerrillas were repulsed after 
attempting to blow up a bridge near O Sralau. Nine Khmer Rouge guerrillas were 
reported killed in the encounter; government casualties were not given. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge attack at Battambang, although apparently on a far smaller 
scale than suggested by early guerrilla reports, was nonetheless a 
psychological lift for the resistance at a crucial moment in the conflict, 
according to Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting has intensified in western Cambodia since September, when Vietnam 
completed the withdrawal of its troops after more than a decade of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats met in Paris last August in an effort to bring an end to the fighting 
but had no success, primarily because the Phnom Penh government refused to 
accept the participation of the Khmer Rouge in a four-party interim government 
that would administer the country until after elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge, which has been accused of killing more than 1 million 
Cambodians while it ruled the country from 1975 to 1979, is the strongest of 
the three rebel factions, all based in Thailand, that have been fighting to 
overthrow the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. The resistance 
alliance occupies the Cambodian seat at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to overcome the impasse of the talks in Paris, Australia proposed 
in October that the United Nations take over the administration of Cambodia 
pending elections. 
</P>
<P>
So far, reaction to the Australian proposal has been generally favorable, 
although the Khmer Rouge reportedly told Australian envoy Michael Costello in 
Bangkok last week that the plan is unacceptable. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the 
leader of another resistance faction, has given qualified acceptance to the 
plan, provided that the U.N. seat remains in the hands of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United States indicated its support for the Australian 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also said that the United States and four other permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union and 
China -- will meet Monday and Tuesday in Paris to consider the latest 
diplomatic moves. The U.S. delegation will be headed by Assistant Secretary of 
State Richard H. Solomon, the State Department's top Asia expert. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Igor Rogachev, deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union, opened 
talks in Beijing on the Cambodian dispute, and diplomats said this could be the 
most interesting of the diplomatic initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is the principal supplier of arms to the Phnom Penh 
government, while China is the arms supplier of the Khmer Rouge. Rogachev was 
reportedly pursuing an initiative put forth by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze aimed at achieving a moratorium on all arms supplies to 
Cambodia. The Chinese are not considered likely to agree. 
</P>
<P>
Costello, the Australian envoy, met over the weekend with Vietnamese officials 
and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen. Costello is to arrive today in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who has been the 
host for four rounds of peace talks involving the Cambodian factions, met 
Wednesday with representatives of the guerrilla groups. He planned to travel to 
Ho Chi Minh City on Saturday for talks with the Vietnamese and Cambodians.

COLD WAR THAW MAY SOLVE 'POISON UMBRELLA' MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
BULGARIA: GEORGY MARKOV FELT A STING AS HE CROSSED A BRIDGE IN LONDON IN 1978. 
FOUR DAYS LATER, HE DIED.

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was pure Cold War intrigue -- the mysterious execution on London's Waterloo 
Bridge of a Bulgarian defector and one-time close friend of the country's 
Communist leader. 
</P>
<P>
It was as dramatic as anything from the pages of a John le Carre novel. Writer 
and playwright Georgy Markov died from a massive dose of poison -- contained 
either in a bullet or the tip of an umbrella that jabbed into his thigh as the 
assassin passed him on the bridge crowded with pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
That was September, 1978, and for more than 11 years, the riddle of Markov's 
death remained locked on the other side of the Iron Curtain in Communist 
Bulgaria. But the winds of political change that have brought a new freedom to 
the nations of Eastern Europe may also now shed light on such incidents as 
Markov's death. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, two months to the day after Todor Zhivkov was overthrown, 
Markov's British-born widow, Annabel, entered the Communist Party's forbidding 
Central Committee headquarters building in Sofia and was promised that 
authorities of a new Bulgaria will conduct a full investigation into her 
husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a 30-minute meeting with Central Committee Secretary and 
senior Politburo member Alexander Lilov, Markov said there was no direct 
admission that her husband had been killed on specific orders from Zhivkov but 
that there were hints. 
</P>
<P>
"He said this had been a terrible time for Bulgaria and that things happened 
which should not have happened," she said. "He said he would help me in any way 
he could in the future, and with any problems (I might have) in publishing my 
husband's works." 
</P>
<P>
Georgy Markov was 49 when he died. He had been working in the Bulgarian 
Language Service of the British Broadcasting Corp.'s World Service in London, 
where he helped prepare information for broadcast into Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
During his years in favor, Markov had been one of his country's leading writers 
and intellectuals, a privileged individual who met frequently with Zhivkov and 
other government leaders. But in 1969, at the age of 38, Markov wrote a play, 
"The Man Who Was I," a controversial work produced in the aftermath of 
Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew it was provocative," his widow told a small group of reporters 
Wednesday. "There was trouble. . . . They suggested he might find a way out." 
</P>
<P>
Within months, Markov had defected, first to Italy, where his brother lived, 
then to West Germany. Eventually, he wound up in London, where he worked for 
the BBC but also continued to write -- a decision that most likely led directly 
to his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
She said the threats began almost immediately, passed to Markov's brother via 
another Bulgarian exile in the West. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, 1978, as Markov crossed the bridge, he felt a sting of pain in his 
thigh and saw a man quickly open an umbrella and disappear. He died four days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Markov said her husband believed he had probably been shot and that the 
umbrella had been used by the assassin to prevent him from being recognized. 
However, the British media, captivated by the idea of a twist to the case 
worthy of a James Bond thriller, never wavered from its own view that the 
umbrella had carried a poison tip. 
</P>
<P>
A British defense research laboratory diagnosed the poison as ricin, a 
derivative of the castor oil plant that is grown in both Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a bitter person," Annabel Markov said. "I've had a good life. It was 
always something in the background that you hoped someday . . . would be 
settled. It's very important for Bulgaria that it be settled so that this kind 
of thing can never happen again."

PROTECTION FROM ILLEGAL EVIDENCE BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, providing a rare victory for criminal defendants, ruled 
Wednesday that prosecutors may not use illegally obtained evidence at a trial 
to show that a defense witness had lied to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-4 vote, the high court chose to rigidly uphold the so-called 
exclusionary rule against the use of illegal evidence, even at the expense of 
the "truth-seeking function" of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we are committed to protecting the people from the disregard of 
their constitutional rights during the course of criminal investigations, 
inadmissibility of illegally obtained evidence must remain the rule, not the 
exception," Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is significant for what the court did not do. Prosecutors had 
hoped that a more conservative high court would allow a much broader use of 
illegally obtained evidence if it could be used to rebut questionable testimony 
by defense witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one of the court's usual hard-liners on crime, Justice Byron R. White, 
joined sides with Brennan's liberal allies. White did not explain his stand, 
which resulted in a ringing affirmation of the exclusionary rule. 
</P>
<P>
Since the court imposed the exclusionary rule on state and local law 
enforcement in 1961, it has allowed a variety of exceptions. If police officers 
acting in "good faith" raid a house based on a search warrant that later proves 
to be flawed, their evidence may nonetheless be used at a trial. In addition, 
prosecutors may use illegal evidence to contradict a defendant who takes the 
witness stand and lies. 
</P>
<P>
Based on such exceptions, the Illinois Supreme Court said last year that 
illegal evidence may also be used to rebut false testimony by a witness for the 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stemmed from the trial in Chicago of Darry James, a youth who was 
convicted of killing another young man in a 1982 gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
Five witnesses at James' trial testified that the defendant, sporting 
shoulder-length reddish hair, did the shooting. But a family friend testified 
-- falsely -- that James had black hair on the day of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial, prosecutors were able to rebut this testimony because the police, 
after illegally arresting James during their investigation, had obtained his 
admission that he had dyed his hair from red to black after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court held that the police evidence, although apparently 
accurate, could not be used in a subsequent trial of James. It ordered a new 
trial with that evidence excluded. (James vs. Illinois, 88-6075.) 
</P>
<P>
In a sharp dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy complained that "today's opinion 
grants the defense side in a criminal case broad immunity to introduce whatever 
false testimony it can produce from the mouth of a friendly witness." He was 
joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor 
and Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
In a second criminal case, this one a prosecution victory, the court ruled that 
a jury may be told about a defendant's past criminal activities, even if the 
defendant was acquitted in the earlier cases. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Rueben Dowling, a Virgin Islands man, was charged with robbing a 
bank of $12,000 while wearing a ski mask. At his trial, a woman testified that 
Dowling had broken into her home and robbed her, also while wearing a ski mask. 
However, Dowling had already been acquitted of this robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Dowling was convicted of bank robbery. On a 6-3 vote, the high court upheld the 
conviction and said the woman's testimony did not put Dowling in double 
jeopardy.

TIMES STORY ON D.C. MAYOR SETS OFF A POLITICAL STORM 
</P>

From a Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times profile of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry has 
created a political squall in the nation's capital and enmeshed the embattled 
mayor in another controversy in advance of what is expected to be a tough 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor of The Times, Barry denied some of the remarks 
attributed to him by staff writer Bella Stumbo, whose account he characterized 
as racist. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the local furor -- and Barry's strongest denials -- involved derogatory 
comments Barry was quoted as making about the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose 
political intentions have been the focus of intense speculation since he moved 
to Washington last year. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times story, Barry was quoted as saying that Jackson "don't wanna run 
nothing but his mouth" and that he would be "the laughingstock of America" if 
he challenged Barry by running for mayor of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Denying he made such remarks, Barry said that "while I am admittedly not the 
best enunciator in the world, I do not use the 'black dialect' she chose to 
attribute to me. . . . I do not speak that way, nor would I have said such a 
thing at all." 
</P>
<P>
Barry also complained that the story was "filled with factual inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
The Times, saying it had taped many of the conversations with Barry, stood by 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the story was to profile the mayor of the nation's capital who has 
been under intense scrutiny. Mayor Barry was given ample room to defend his 
Administration and rebut his critics," Shelby Coffey III, editor and executive 
vice president of the newspaper, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"What emerged was a balanced and perceptive portrait of the mayor as he 
revealed himself in 18 hours of interviews," Coffey said. "After reviewing 
notes and tapes, it's clear that the mayor's comments were fairly portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, evidently trying to distance himself from the controversy, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is preparing to launch a fourth-term reelection bid under a cloud of 
controversy over allegations of drug use and other personal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another chapter in the saga. It solidifies my constituents' negative 
feelings about the mayor," said James Nathanson, a D.C. councilman and former 
Barry supporter. 
</P>
<P>
One reflection of the community's interest is the extensive media coverage 
Barry's dispute with The Times has received in the local media. 
</P>
<P>
"The real impact of this story locally is not the fact that it was published in 
the Los Angeles Times but the fact that the Washington Post has taken it over 
in a rather grand fashion, with a front page story, sidebars and whatnot," said 
Stephen Hess, an expert on politics and the media at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the alleged inaccuracies, Barry cited a reference in the 
article to his childhood days in Mississippi, adding "it was Tennessee." Barry 
was born in Mississippi and moved to Tennessee at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
He also took issue with a reference to political corruption that said "people 
close to Barry keep going to jail for pilfering public coffers." 
</P>
<P>
Barry said that, "during my 11 years as mayor, there have been only three 
people 'close to the mayor' who have been convicted of taking public funds." 
</P>
<P>
That assertion was disputed by the Washington Post, which said in its article 
on the mayor's denial that "at least 12 top-ranking and mid-level District 
government officials have been convicted of crimes related to their official 
conduct" since Barry assumed office in 1979.

TEXT OF MAYOR BARRY'S LETTER TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been mayor of Washington, D.C., for 11 years. This fact alone suggests a 
degree of intelligence and sophistication. Yet, from reading Bella Stumbo's 
article, "Barry: He Keeps D.C. Guessing," people who do not know me would think 
I leaped from the screen of an Amos 'n' Andy show, totally ingenuous and eager 
to reveal a number of base characteristics to a previously unknown reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Although my schedule is incredibly full -- totaling that of many governors, 
county executives and mayors combined, and including pre-campaign activity -- I 
granted Ms. Stumbo an interview based on her word that she wanted to do a 
comprehensive story about our great city and the Barry Administration. She said 
she also wanted to look at what is happening to black mayors around the 
country; whether racism is a factor, and the pressures on me as a black mayor 
in the nation's capital. She insisted that she did not want to do another 
Barry-bashing or D.C. bashing story. 
</P>
<P>
I gave her a list of names and phone numbers of people she could talk to, to 
see several sides of Washington, D.C., and of me, as a politician, a campaigner 
and a human being. 
</P>
<P>
I was shocked when I read the article. It did not present a balanced view, nor 
quote any of my supporters who spent their valuable time talking with Ms. 
Stumbo -- Bob Johnson, my campaign committee chair; Kemry Hughes, a young-adult 
supporter and former youth mayor; Peb Ali, a former member of Pride Inc., the 
organization I founded when I moved to Washington in the late 1960s. Rather too 
many paragraphs were filled with factual inaccuracies and, in some cases, 
blatant lies. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Ms. Stumbo's statement, " . . . people close to Barry keep 
going to jail for pilfering the public coffers." She names three whom she says 
are "among" this group. The truth is, that during my 11 years as mayor, there 
have been only three people "close to the mayor" who have been convicted of 
taking public funds. I am pained by even this small number; pained for them and 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
But this hardly justifies Ms. Stumbo's dig, because I have been a public 
servant for nearly 30 years, achieving a record that speaks for itself. I 
refuse to allow that record to be judged by the mistakes of a limited few out 
of the thousands of people who have worked with or for me. 
</P>
<P>
And while I am admittedly not the best enunciator in the world, I do not use 
the "black dialect" she chose to attribute to me. To say that I said of Jesse 
Jackson, "he don't wanna be no mayor," is ridiculous. I do not speak that way, 
nor would I have said such a thing at all, much less to a virtual stranger, and 
a reporter at that! 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Ms. Stumbo has been reading too much of Paul Laurence Dunbar, and 
thinks this dialect accurately reflects that of all black people. She is wrong, 
and many people I know -- black and white -- are insulted by her 
characterization. Most reporters realize that in casual conversation, grammar 
may occasionally slip; they account for this by making appropriate corrections 
in the written text. That is only fair. But I know now that fairness was not 
what Ms. Stumbo had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
From her description of my office as "a lazy Latin palace," to her statement 
that I grew up in Mississippi (it was Tennessee), Ms. Stumbo stumbles through 
this article, sliding from prejudicial opinion to total falsehoods, and slings 
mud along the way. The reference to "lazy Latin palace," is not only an affront 
to me, but also to the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
I allowed Ms. Stumbo to travel with me for several days to a number of events 
on my schedule. In this way, I thought, she would glean a complete picture. 
Instead, she wasted ink on the wine, the chicken, the marble stairways -- a 
partial skimming with no substance, but characterizations throughout to leave 
the subtle suggestion of a shallow leader who lacks sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
What the national media picked up from her story is what I supposedly said 
about Jesse Jackson. I know I did not use the words Ms. Stumbo put into my 
mouth. I did say I welcomed my good friend Jesse Jackson to Washington, and 
even recommended an architect to remodel his home. I did say I know Jesse does 
not want to run for mayor, and that I am running. In no way did I denigrate 
him, nor will I let Ms. Stumbo drive a wedge between me and other members of 
this community, including the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
All the denigration in the article is Ms. Stumbo's, toward me. She said she 
wanted to look at racism. She did, all right -- through her own prejudiced 
eyes. She looked at it and embraced it fully. This article does a disservice to 
me and to all who know and support me. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Stumbo -- who claimed she wanted to be fair to Washington -- owes me and 
the citizens of this city a deep apology.

House Democrats announced a fund-raising drive in anticipation of perhaps 18 
congressional districts shifting toward the Republicans after the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, IMPAC 2000, will try to raise $1 million to help Democrats keep 
or win state offices before congressional districts are redrawn. With six or 
seven new seats in California at stake, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), chairman 
of the drive, noted that the party in power will decide which party the 
boundaries will favor when the legislatures adjust them to reflect population 
shifts since 1980. California's delegation is expected to grow from 45 
representatives to 51 or 52, or almost 12% of the House.

MESSAGE IS CLEAR: GOVERNOR WANTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to year-round schools, Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state 
budget contains few specifics and very little new money, but it sends a clear 
political message that the state's fiscally conservative chief executive wants 
California schools off the traditional summer-break calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not exactly sure of the specifics of this, but I think the message is 
clear: he wants us to move in that direction," Bill Honig, state superintendent 
of public instruction, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has never taken such a strong position in use of facilities 
year-round. It's his boldest, strongest statement to date," said Charles 
Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Education. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a continuing explosion in school enrollment, Deukmejian in his 
State of the State address Monday proposed three steps pushing the state toward 
year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Saying California schools cannot afford to "depend simply on building our way 
out of the shortage of classrooms," Deukmejian proposed increasing incentives 
to districts that switch to multitrack, year-round calendars that ensure that 
classrooms do not sit idle for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
His package also includes allocating slightly more money to reward districts 
that have multitrack, year-round schools and loosening requirements for voter 
approval of local bond measures to build year-round schools. He also proposed 
giving districts with year-round schools priority in tapping the state's pool 
of school construction funds, a plan similar to an existing law. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what effect the governor's proposals will have on the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, where year-round schools are being hotly debated as 
the district struggles to cope with massive overcrowding. About 23% of the 
district's 610,000 students already attend year-round schools, contrasted with 
only 9% of students statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The district last year received a whopping $21 million of the $30 million 
bestowed on California schools as part of the incentive program to switch to 
year-round. This year, the governor proposed raising the pool to $43 million -- 
but he also wants to change the allocation formula in a way that could hurt Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The current formula is tipped in favor of big, crowded districts, but both the 
state legislative analyst's office and some members of the Legislature have 
criticized the program, which pays up to $150 per student. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, most of the money is eaten up by increased costs of operating 
schools year-round, but approximately $50 per student is available to 
individual schools to use for whatever educational programs they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Jerome, an aide to state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who plans 
to introduce legislation to change the formula, said Los Angeles has the most 
to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard to get a change because of the size of the Los Angeles 
delegation (in the Legislature), but if the governor is behind it, it improves 
the chances," Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's support for year-round schools may also give the concept 
credibility beyond those education leaders that have been pushing for it. 
</P>
<P>
"If year-round is going to be a viable program, people have to view it 
differently," said Ron Prescott, a lobbyist for the Los Angeles district. "The 
governor talking about it will change the perceptions of it over time.

GOVERNOR: HIGHWAYS FACE CUTS IF GAS TAX FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Without the passage of a gas tax increase this year, Gov. George Deukmejian 
warned Wednesday that the state's transportation program will have to absorb 
$533 million in budget cuts that would force a moratorium in new highway 
construction until July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in the awarding of new construction contracts would postpone 
completion of such showcase transportation projects as Los Angeles County's 
Century Freeway and the Harbor Freeway transitway, as well as the widening of 
Interstate 5 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A $52-million state contribution toward Los Angeles' Metro Rail would also be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
But some lawmakers accused Deukmejian of tailoring the transportation cuts so 
that vote-rich areas of the state would feel the cuts the most and be more 
inclined to endorse the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the governor is very Machiavellian in cutting Metro Rail as a way to 
get people in Los Angeles to vote for (the gas tax proposal)," Assembly Speaker 
Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who is leading a campaign to win voter approval of a 
9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase in June, painted the bleak picture of 
California's transportation future in his final budget proposal to the 
Legislature. It was the first time his Administration presented a definitive 
outline of the effect failure of the gas tax increase would have on the 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
For the state Department of Transportation to live within its finances, 
Deukmejian said, many major programs would have to be either reduced or 
eliminated, a hiring freeze would have to be instituted and new equipment 
purchases would be severely curtailed. He said none of the cutbacks would be 
necessary if the tax increase is endorsed by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian suggested that Caltrans could save $102 million by eliminating all 
construction projects paid for entirely by state funds, $120 million by 
discontinuing the department's use of private engineers, $64 million by 
withholding funds earmarked for mass transit -- including $52 million for Los 
Angeles' Metro Rail project -- $58 million by hiring and equipment cutbacks and 
$65 million by delaying new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The programs that would remain intact under his proposal include seismic 
retrofitting of bridges, litter collection -- a pet project with the Republican 
governor -- and maintenance of highways. But even while highway maintenance 
funds would not be cut, Deukmejian noted that there would be no increases "to 
handle added inventory on the system or to reduce maintenance backlogs." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the programs slated for financial surgery are supported either 
entirely or in part by the state's beleaguered 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. 
For years officials have complained that the gas tax, one of the lowest in the 
nation, has not produced enough revenue for the transportation system to keep 
pace with inflation and the state's phenomenal growth in population. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase -- which cannot go into effect unless voters approve a 
constitutional amendment in June to modify the state's spending limit -- would 
help pay for an $18.5-billion program designed to expand the highway system, 
ease congestion, construct mass transit facilities and catch up on projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the governor's budget is realistically grim," said Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). "If (the gas tax) 
does not pass there will not be enough money to both maintain roads and expand 
the system. It will delay projects which will mean increasing congestion . . . 
and the nightmare continues." 
</P>
<P>
Both legislators and Caltrans officials saw the new construction moratorium as 
having the most severe impact on California's transportation system. State 
Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said it "really translates into a deferral of 
$350 million worth of projects" because of lost federal matching funds.

$2-BILLION STATE PLAN WOULD BENEFIT FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS

As runaway housing prices threaten the American dream of homeownership for 
untold Californians, Gov. George Deukmejian acted Wednesday to prevent the 
vision from collapsing for many prospective first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
In a document accompanying his proposed state budget, Deukmejian called for a 
beefed-up housing program spread over five years that would provide 
first-timers with $2 billion in loans to acquire a down payment or obtain 
mortgage interest rates at below-market levels. 
</P>
<P>
One top state official estimated that about 15,000 homes could be purchased and 
would shelter more than 50,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was endorsed as a "good first step" by the California Assn. of 
Realtors, a trade organization with a major stake in buying and selling of 
housing. It also drew support from the California Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action attracted backhanded praise from the Democratic chairman 
of the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee, Assemblyman Dan 
Hauser of Arcata. He complained that Deukmejian last fall vetoed two first-time 
home-buyer bills that Hauser carried. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to having the governor as a new partner in advocating creative 
affordable-housing legislation," Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's plan, parts of it subject to approval by the Legislature and 
ratification by the voters, basically would commit the use of state bond funds 
for five years to assist low- and moderate-income Californians who want to buy 
their first home. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the state aids low-income people who earn $25,000 to $45,000 a year 
in obtaining loans at interest rates below market levels. This means the state, 
in effect, loans them money to "buy down" the interest rate so they can afford 
the monthly payments, or provides low-interest loans so they can come up with a 
sufficient down payment. 
</P>
<P>
State Housing Finance Agency Director Karney Hodge, whose agency administers 
the program, said the Deukmejian plan calls for expanding the project to 
include those Californians earning $50,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
He said the state would wait until the house was sold to collect the money it 
loaned at low interest rates. Typically, a house is sold in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Hodge forecast that the program would help finance the 
purchase of about 15,000 homes during the next five years. "At 3 1/2 people per 
family, that is in excess of 50,000 people that are under roof," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Housing costs, especially in urban areas, have increased so dramatically that 
home ownership by perhaps millions of first-timers has become an impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
Although the funds would be spread statewide, Hodge said that under the program 
"we'll be able to reach a segment of the population we have not reached before 
and that would be in some of the major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles 
and San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to characterize the impact on the overall first-time buyer 
population but insisted that it would be as "good as or better than" home 
purchase programs operated by any other state. "I'd put it up against any of 
them," Hodge said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to make sure that the state remains committed to the housing 
program after Deukmejian leaves office in 1991, Hodge said, a committee that 
decides how bond funds will be spent will take steps soon to make the 
enterprise a five-year venture. Deukmejian allies dominate the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Finance Agency will raise $1.8 billion of the $2 billion by issuing 
both revenue and tax-exempt bonds under its existing authority, Deukmejian told 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $200 million must be "reauthorized" by the Legislature and 
voters. That money was approved by the voters in 1982 but not spent for a 
"Cal-First" first-time home-buyers program because the terms were so 
restrictive and the mortgage market so unfavorable that the program went 
nowhere, Hodge said.

A magnitude 4.2 earthquake hit the Tehachapi Mountains, 12 miles north of 
Mojave in Kern County, on Wednesday, but authorities said they had received no 
reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Although the quake was centered near the California Aqueduct, workers on the

S.D. POLICE HALT BORDER PATROLS BY SPECIAL SQUAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special police squad that has patroled the U.S.-Mexico border strip since May 
has been pulled out of the area, and San Diego police officials say they are 
once again studying alternative methods for combating crimes committed against 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Chief Manuel Guaderrama described the department's action as an 
opportunity to reevaluate and probably revise the unit's operations and tactics 
following the Dec. 7 shooting of a 17-year-old Mexican youth who is now 
paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
Such reassignments have often followed shootings by previous similar border 
squads, but Guaderrama said that, this time, the unit may be changed 
drastically -- from its recent status as a foot patrol to a high-profile 
motorized unit operating out of four-wheel-drive vehicles posted along the 
international boundary. It is unlikely that the officers will be redeployed 
regularly on foot, Guaderrama said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was better to put them on hold till we have a plan for better 
coverage along the border," Guaderrama said. "They probably won't be deployed 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Guaderrama said, is to both increase safety for the officers and 
broaden the area covered by the small anti-crime unit, which consists of a 
sergeant and five officers, all uniformed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two U.S. Border Patrol agents who witnessed part of the Dec. 7 
shooting by the San Diego police squad have provided investigators with 
accounts of the incident that, according to Marco E. Lopez, a San Diego 
attorney representing the victim, raise "serious doubts" about the veracity of 
the official police version. 
</P>
<P>
However, police Sgt. Frank Martinez, who headed the investigating of the 
shooting, said the apparently contradictory accounts of the incident have been 
resolved through supplemental questioning of the federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol agents have also told investigators that they were unaware 
that the police unit was operating in the area on the evening of the shooting, 
a dangerous oversight that raises the risk of an accidental armed confrontation 
between different law enforcement forces. Under its operational guidelines, the 
San Diego police squad was required to keep the Border Patrol closely informed 
about its presence and whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout of the squad, known as the Border Crime Intervention Unit, marks 
the latest shift in one of the thorniest issues with which senior San Diego 
police officers have had to deal in recent years. Since the late 1970s, 
authorities have deployed a number of similar details along the border zone, 
but all have eventually been disbanded or reassigned, usually after 
controversial shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Robbers have long victimized the hundreds of illegal aliens who seek to jump 
the border each day; migrants often carry large amounts of cash and other 
valuables designed to help them start their new lives. 
</P>
<P>
The unit was successful in deterring crime against migrants, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to pull out the latest special unit was related to the Dec. 7 
shooting, an incident that Guaderrama says underlined the perils faced by 
officers serving on the squad. The decision was made a few days after the 
shooting, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Guaderrama's logic was characterized as "ludicrous" by Roberto Martinez, a 
Latino rights activist who has long been critical of what he characterizes as 
brutal tactics employed by local police and federal immigration authorities 
along the border. He alleged that Manuel Martin Flores Campo, the victim of the 
Dec. 7 shooting, was hit in the back as he was fleeing the squad. Flores was 
the first person shot by the latest incarnation of the border police squad, 
which was launched in May. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger is not to officers, but to the undocumented immigrants," Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, now hospitalized at UC San Diego Medical Center, has said he was 
unarmed and hadn't threatened or harmed anyone, his lawyers maintained. He has 
denied charges of resisting arrest, robbery and attempted robbery that are 
pending in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police say Flores was shot shortly before midnight when he appeared 
poised to attack police patrol members Sgt. Joseph Wood and Officer Cesar 
Castro with what seemed to be a knife but turned out to be a screwdriver. San 
Diego police have indicated that the officers fired while pursuing the suspect 
in the dry area of the river channel, while they were within 15 feet of the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
However, Border Patrol Agents G.W. Knight and Clark J. Messer said in 
interviews with police that they believed members of the border squad may have 
fired from atop or on the Tijuana River's concrete southern levee, which rises 
from the south edge of the broad flood-control channel that encases the river. 
That position would put them much farther away from Flores than 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Marco E. Lopez, a San Diego attorney representing the victim in a planned civil 
claim against the city, said the "contradictory" statements raise "serious 
doubts" about the police version of events. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego Police Department's Martinez said the two Border Patrol 
agents had revised previous assertions that the gunshots had come from the levy 
structure itself, adding, "We've already written some other reports on that." 
</P>
<P>
The police investigation of the incident, which has been completed, will be 
forwarded to the district attorney's office this week for review, Martinez 
said. The district attorney routinely reviews shootings by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The two Border Patrol officers also told investigators that they were unaware 
that the police squad was operating in the area that evening. That would seem 
to violate a basic tenet of the squad's operating procedures: to always 
maintain close contact with the armed federal agents who patrol the border 
daily. The idea was to avoid cases of mistaken identity among the two law 
enforcement agencies operating in the tense darkness of the border zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a very strict policy about notifying them (the Border Patrol) every 
time we were out in the area," Guaderrama said. Guaderrama said he assumed that 
the Border Patrol had been informed that the San Diego police squad was 
operating the night of Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the squad contend that they had notified the Border Patrol of their 
presence, Sgt. Martinez said, adding that the officers had been operating in 
the same area the preceding two days. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Crime Intervention Unit replaced a similar anti-crime squad composed 
of about a dozen members, made up equally of San Diego officers and Border 
Patrol agents. During its five-year life, the former outfit shot 44 suspects, 
18 of whom died. That unit was disbanded a year ago after four fatal shootings 
during a two-week period that began in late December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Border Patrol agents expressed private dissatisfaction when the Police 
Department decided last May to create a new border anti-crime squad composed 
solely of city officers. Federal officials declined a police offer to join in 
later. Border Patrol officials said they would henceforth rely on their regular 
agents and patrol tactics to deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
Since the anti-crime unit was reassigned, said Lt. Bill Brown of the Police 
Department's Southern Division, where the squad is based, the officers have 
been entering the canyons, Tijuana River area and other areas along the rugged 
international boundary in response to reports of crimes against migrants 
provided by Border Patrol agents.

BROWN JURY ACQUITS 3 ON SOME CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: MEMBERS WERE TOLD TO CONTINUE DELIBERATIONS AFTER SAYING THEY MAY BE 
STYMIED ON THE MORE SERIOUS CHARGES IN THE RELIGIOUS-DEPROGRAMMING CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The mother and sister of Ginger Brown were found not guilty Wednesday of 
charges that they falsely imprisoned and battered her during a religious 
deprogramming attempt, but the defendants were prohibited by a judge's gag 
order from doing much more than crying, smiling and giggling in relief. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also acquitted co-defendant Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido, whose family 
home was used during the deprogramming attempt, of the three most serious 
charges he faced: kidnaping, battery and false imprisonment with threat of 
physical harm. 
</P>
<P>
But the most critical charges in the case remained unresolved by the jury, 
which said it was at "an apparent impasse." The judge told them to continue 
deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
Unresolved are kidnaping charges against the mother, Dorothy Brown, 58, and 
sister, Holly Brown, 25, as well as charges of kidnaping, false imprisonment 
and battery faced by Ginger Brown's father, Earle Brown, 58, and deprogrammer 
Cliff Daniels, 35. Daniels was hired by the family to try to persuade Brown to 
disavow her allegiance to a group known as Great Among the Nations and its 
leader, Benjamin Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday afternoon, Vista Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr. 
privately polled the jurors to determine the numerical split in their 
deliberations. After asking the jurors whether they wanted to keep the vote 
tally secret -- an invitation that one juror accepted -- Moon said he would not 
publicly release the tally. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that the area might be one of dispute, the jury also had read back 
to it testimony from Earle Brown in which he described his wife's and his joint 
decision to hire Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Moon rejected a defense motion for a mistrial and ordered jurors to resume 
their deliberations at 9 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not use the term hopelessly deadlocked," Moon told attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Although the partial verdicts brought a clear sense of relief to the 
defendants, their reaction was stifled by Moon's order that no attorney or 
defendant discuss the case, because the jury is still deliberating. Moon's gag 
order even prohibited Erler and Brown's mother and sister from telling 
reporters their reaction to the not-guilty verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
Moon said comments to the press on even the resolved verdicts might influence 
the jurors should they hear or read about them, despite admonitions to ignore 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
However, the defendants cried, laughed, smiled and hugged in the courthouse 
hallway amid television cameras and newspaper photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, reporters were forced to rely on secondhand reactions to the 
verdicts, such as this one from Hank Erler's mother, Nan: 
</P>
<P>
"I just thank God. I prayed and prayed and prayed that they (jurors) would see 
through all this, and that, even if you maybe are emancipated when you're 18, 
there's no magical age to stop being a caring parent." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, 24-year-old Ginger Brown, the prosecution's star witness against 
her relatives and the other two co-defendants, said she is satisfied with the 
jury's verdicts so far. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is the jury is finding what best it can, based on the evidence, 
so as far as I'm concerned it's a positive thing if they (her mother, sister 
and Erler) don't have to be punished for something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically content the jury is doing its job," she said. "I know it's not 
over; there's more to do." 
</P>
<P>
The jury's partial verdicts left unresolved the major issue of whether parents 
are guilty of kidnaping an adult child, even if they believe it is for the 
child's own good. Moon had ruled that the parents' motive could not serve as a 
defense, because the defendants were unable to show that Brown was in jeopardy 
during her association with Great Among the Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the defense argued during the trial that Brown baited her parents and 
the others to kidnap her so she could later sue for monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear Tuesday, from notes the jury sent the judge, that at least some 
jurors were torn between convicting some of the defendants based on the letter 
of the law, and acquitting them out of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Moon then said he might authorize a so-called special verdict, in which, if the 
jurors simply found that the various elements of the crime existed, the actual 
verdict would be pronounced by the judge himself. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon never got to that point Wednesday. Instead, the jury sent a note to 
him saying it had reached seven of the 20 possible verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The verdicts on Erler were read first. Erler, whose mother's Escondido home was 
used for the five-day deprogramming attempt in May, 1988, threw back his head 
in relief, clapped loudly and reached forward to hug his attorney, Charles 
Duff. 
</P>
<P>
Erler was generally considered the least important player among the five 
defendants because he was not present at Brown's abduction from an Encinitas 
parking lot near where she worked, and was present only during parts of the 
deprogramming attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown family members hugged each other after the not-guilty verdicts for 
Holly and Dorothy were read. 
</P>
<P>
If and when the jury resolves the remaining counts, the defendants will still 
face additional charges of conspiracy to kidnap and false imprisonment, for 
which testimony and evidence is still to be taken. Moon has said he wanted 
those charges to be tried separately because of different rules of evidence. 
But Wednesday, he suggested that, at least in Erler's case, the conspiracy 
charges might be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's not guilty of the felony, should I dismiss the conspiracy on the 
theory he can't be convicted of conspiring a felony that didn't exist?" he 
asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would decide that question later. 
</P>
<P>
Moon issued his gag order first thing Wednesday morning in the wake of news 
articles in which attorneys discussed and speculated on the jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
He prohibited the attorneys and defendants from discussing the trial because of 
"the delicacy of the jury deliberations and certain notes that have come back 
and forth between jurors and the court." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to preserve the sanctity of the jury deliberation process and the 
privacy of the jury, and each juror's conscience, in making their decisions in 
this matter," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
By afternoon, attorneys for Copley Press, television Channels 8 and 10 and the 
Oceanside Blade-Citizen newspaper had arrived in the courtroom to argue against 
the gag order, but Moon said he would not consider changing his mind until 
hearing more arguments by them at a 10 a.m. hearing today.

BRODERICK SAYS SHE'S LOST HOPE OF FAIR TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: 'IT'S ME AGAINST EVERYBODY,' MURDER DEFENDANT STATES ON EVE OF A HEARING 
OVER HER REQUEST TO WRITE AND CALL HER CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the eve of a hearing on her request for permission to talk to her two sons, 
Elisabeth A. (Betty) Broderick told The Times that she has lost all hope of 
receiving a fair trial in the San Diego courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's me against everybody. I can't go against the system anymore," Broderick 
said in a brief interview Tuesday night at the County Jail in Las Colinas. "I 
give up. I'm dead. I'm gone. My family is dead. It's over. I cannot fight this 
machinery." 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are going to have to grow up without me and, when they turn 18, they 
can see me again," she said. "I'm throwing up my hands on the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 42, is charged with murdering her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick 
III, 44, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, in the bedroom of their 
Hillcrest home Nov. 5. She has pleaded not guilty and is being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
In a request filed Dec. 20 in San Diego Superior Court, Betty Broderick asked 
permission to write and call her two sons, Daniel T. Broderick IV, 13, and 
Rhett Broderick, 10. The boys have been living since November in a Denver 
suburb with Daniel Broderick's brother, Larry Broderick, who is the 
court-appointed temporary guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's hearing began, Judge Peter Riddle announced that it, as well 
as all hearings in the Family Court case, would be closed to the public. The 
judge said he was acting to avoid "the very real possibility of psychological 
damage to the children." Riddle said the order will remain in effect until Feb. 
14, 1997, when Rhett turns 18. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the order, the result of Betty Broderick's request could not be 
learned. After the 40-minute hearing, which Broderick did not attend, all the 
attorneys in the case declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, anticipating that the hearing would be frustrating for her, 
Broderick had asked a friend to call her lawyer and tell him she would rather 
spend the day in her jail cell than go to court. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in prison garb, her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, Broderick 
repeated her claims that her ex-husband, a prominent and wealthy medical 
malpractice attorney, had bilked her out of her rightful share of his 
seven-figure income. She sketched a dreary portrait of their early life 
together in a Boston tenement, when he attended Harvard Law School and she 
baby-sat to help feed their first child. 
</P>
<P>
But money, she insisted, was never the issue for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about money. The subject of this is the kids. That's always been 
it for me. The whole reason I'm here is the kids," Broderick said, as she sat 
in a partitioned row of inmates, separated from visitors by a plate-glass 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"I can manage poverty. We were poor for years," she said. "But I couldn't 
handle having to watch while somebody hurt my children, over and over. I can't 
tell you the phone calls I'd get. It was ripping my heart out on a daily basis, 
non-stop. What could I do? 
</P>
<P>
"He took my reputation, my home, my children. These things don't have a money 
sign on them. How do you buy a reputation that I'd built for 40 years? I can't 
go out and make new children. The word was he was going to have more. That made 
it even worse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hopelessness she expressed, Broderick appeared energetic. She 
smiled often and laughed ironically when she was asked to describe life in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's eye-opening," she said. "I get to ask some good questions. I never knew 
you could shoot crack. I'm learning a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is so nice to me here," she added, noting that her first cellmate was 
Karen Wilkening, the convicted madam, who curled Broderick's hair before her 
first court appearance. "I'm no threat to them." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing clearly weighed on Broderick's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life, from when I was a little tiny kid, all I wanted to be was a 
mommy," Broderick said. "Before this (divorce), I had what I'd dreamed of: a 
charming husband, a nice house, healthy children. I was doing what as a little 
girl I wanted to do. And Dan was doing what he, as a little boy, wanted to do. 
We were on Cloud 9 for a very short time, because it took us so long to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a good mother. Those kids were my life. My husband worked every 
weekend. Who do you think was home? He called it 'women's work,' " she said, 
grimacing. "All the money was him, everything to do with the kids was me." 
</P>
<P>
After she lost custody of the children, she said, "psychologically, I was so 
stripped." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter asked: "What would you tell people who say you're a bad mother 
because you murdered your husband?" 
</P>
<P>
Broderick responded: "There is a real good answer for that, but I can't tell 
you. I want to. But. No, it's premature.

BUDGET PLAN HAS GOOD NEWS FOR CAMPUSES, BAD FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 1990 state budget would earmark more than $17 
million for Cal State San Marcos to prepare California's newest university for 
its first class of 250 full-time students this fall, but it contains bad news 
for San Diego County's poor. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $54.1-billion budget, unveiled Wednesday by Deukmejian and his 
last before he leaves office, also allocates millions of dollars for other 
higher-education and park concerns in the county, including increased 
maintenance and lifeguards for beaches at Carlsbad and San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
But the spending plan packs ominous signs for county drivers: Unless voters 
throughout the state agree to a 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase this 
summer, construction on $785 million worth of San Diego road projects will be 
delayed or scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
Projects jeopardized in the transportation plan include the widening of 
Interstate 5 from Del Mar Heights Road to Interstate 805 and the first phase of 
extending I-15 south from Mission Valley along 40th Street, according to a list 
compiled by the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, what it will do is delay everything, and we can only guess as to 
how long at this point," said Jim Larson, spokesman for the Caltrans district 
office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
However, the budget would allocate $17 million for track improvements on the 
Los Angeles-to-San Diego Amtrak line. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another kind of traffic -- drug traffic across the international 
border -- may suffer as well under the proposed spending plan. Deukmejian 
announced Tuesday night that the California National Guard will receive $10 
million in federal grants to help local law enforcement agencies apprehend drug 
runners in San Diego, the Imperial Valley and other entry points. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget includes a $5-million loan for the proposed San Diego 
Olympic Sports Training Facility in the South Bay, a loan that is supposed to 
be repaid through sale of special license plates. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the plan contains bad news for San Diego County's poor. 
Deukmejian has proposed deep cuts in social programs that would require 
families on welfare to forgo millions of dollars in expected benefit increases. 
</P>
<P>
The total impact of Deukmejian's budget on San Diego County residents will not 
be known for weeks, maybe months, as legislative analysts and lawmakers roll up 
their sleeves to plow through the hundreds of pages of the plan. Legislators 
have until June to debate the proposal and hand it back to the governor with 
their suggested cuts or increases. 
</P>
<P>
But, at first blush, San Diego County officials say, the plan does not hold 
good news for the area poor and mentally ill. Estimates show that, although 
Deukmejian has increased the social service budget, welfare and health programs 
would need $1 billion more to maintain their current level of service. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing that this is our preliminary view, it suggests that we will be 
looking at some reductions in service delivery and some health and welfare 
programs as a result of these proposed cuts," said John Sweeten, the county's 
director of intergovernmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Deukmejian intends to freeze welfare benefits at current levels, 
Sweeten said. That translates into $18 million less for San Diego welfare 
recipients than if the governor had allowed the cost-of-living increase to go 
through. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of mental health, San Diego County's budget, already meager by 
state standards, would suffer even more. Deukmejian's budget would probably 
mean $1.5 million less for the area's mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Not all is woe, however. Sweeten said the governor intends to increase some 
allowances to pay medical care for the poor -- a move that would give the 
county a one-time, $4-million windfall in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
And, in terms of brick and mortar, San Diego has some clear winners in the 
Deukmejian budget, which sets aside nearly $100 million in buildings for area 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan allows for $8.3 million to operate Cal State San Marcos, the North 
County campus that was added to the extensive California State University 
system last year. Those funds -- enough to pay the salaries of 121 
administrators, professors and other college employees -- will suffice for the 
infant campus to admit its first 250 full-time students in the fall, according 
to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the money to operate Cal State San Marcos, Deukmejian made room for $9 
million in capital improvements, including $4.57 million for its initial 
buildings and $2 million to acquire books for its library. 
</P>
<P>
At UC San Diego, Deukmejian wants to spend $59.1 million -- the biggest chunk 
for any single campus. The amount includes $42 million for a 
111,000-square-foot science building, $6.5 million for an addition to the 
central library and nearly $1.2 million to help improve access for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Area parks, from the beaches to the desert, would be bolstered under the plan. 
The governor wants to add lifeguards and maintenance employees to patrol newly 
expanded areas of the Carlsbad and San Onofre state beaches, while continuing 
the state's program to buy up nearly 4,500 acres near Ocotillo Wells for 
off-road vehicle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Although dune buggy riders were cheered by the Deukmejian budget, more 
traditional motorists received glum news. Unless voters approve the gasoline 
tax increase, there will be a $533 deficit in the transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
And that means the state will put several key projects on hold. Some of those 
are in the Sorrento Valley, where Caltrans wants to widen I-5 south of Del Mar 
and do more construction on the interchange of I-5 and California 56.

MAN CHARGED IN FATAL SHOOTING OF GANG MEMBER IN PACOIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man was charged Wednesday in the death of a 17-year-old boy who 
was fatally shot in a Pacoima park, possibly in a dispute over stolen ice 
cream, the Los Angeles Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo Ramirez, 26, who lives near downtown Los Angeles, was being held 
without bail at the Foothill Division on a charge of murder, Detective Marshall 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Tuesday night following a lengthy investigation of the Nov. 28 
slaying at Paxton Park of Joseph Tapia of Sylmar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Flores, 29, of Van Nuys, who was with Ramirez during the shooting, 
also was arrested Tuesday but was released uncharged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We determined he was not a participant in the shooting," White said. "He will 
be a witness in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the victim, a gang member, was passing through the park at Haddon 
Avenue and Paxton Street, and Ramirez and Flores confronted him after he took 
ice cream from a pushcart vendor without paying. 
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, Ramirez drew a handgun and shot Tapia, who was 
unarmed, police said. Ramirez and Flores ran to a nearby car and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Tapia was taken by friends to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where 
he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
White said it was unclear whether the confrontation was over the stolen ice 
cream. He said words were exchanged between Ramirez and Tapia but it had not 
been determined what was said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Al Ferrand said investigators were led to the suspects through 
information from witnesses, a description of the getaway car and other evidence 
he did not disclose. He said the gun that was used has not been found and 
detectives also were unable to locate the ice-cream vendor.

IRS JOINS ROBBINS INQUIRY, INTERVIEWS CONTRIBUTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal investigation of Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) has progressed to a 
new phase as Internal Revenue Service agents have begun questioning Robbins' 
campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Boehm, acting chief of the IRS criminal division in Sacramento, confirmed 
Wednesday that a letter has been sent to Robbins' contributors asking whether 
the lawmaker or his staff sought "money or other favors in exchange for 
official action." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Robbins repeated earlier denials of any wrongdoing. Robbins 
maintained that the IRS is "not going to find anything because it doesn't 
exist. I have nothing to hide." He acknowledged that he has turned over volumes 
of material to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in June that Robbins was a subject of a federal grand jury 
investigation into political corruption at the state Capitol and that the FBI 
and IRS were gathering records to determine whether a criminal case could be 
brought against the veteran San Fernando Valley lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, testimony from two witnesses at the federal political 
corruption trial of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) has implicated Robbins. 
Montoya, who is standing trial on 12 counts of extortion, racketeering and 
corruption, is the only lawmaker indicted in the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At Montoya's trial, a capital lobbyist last week testified that in 1985 he was 
told by a third party that Robbins demanded a campaign contribution to push a 
bill on behalf of osteopathic physicians through the Senate Insurance, Claims 
and Corporations Committee, which he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, star witness John Shahabian, a Senate aide who became an FBI 
informant, testified that advice from Robbins led him to offer a payoff of 
$3,000 to Montoya to win his help in passing a measure on behalf of a dummy FBI 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest wrinkle in the investigation, Robbins' contributors began 
receiving letters from the IRS late last month, the senator said. Boehm refused 
to disclose how many letters have been mailed. 
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the one-page letter from IRS Special Agent Howard 
E. Moline tells contributors that the IRS "is investigating the activities of 
California state Sen. Alan Robbins." He said it was directed to people who "had 
a financial transaction with Sen. Robbins or one of his campaign committees." 
</P>
<P>
Boehm said the letter tells contributors: "Official action could be voting on a 
bill, introducing legislation or meeting with officials of state agencies or 
local governments." 
</P>
<P>
Moline says he also is interested in "any instances wherein you were denied 
access to the senator unless you made a significant campaign contribution." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who heads the corruption investigation, declined to 
comment on the IRS request. However, he acknowledged that the IRS is often 
called in on cases involving complex financial transactions because of the 
agency's expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government has not prosecuted Montoya on tax charges, IRS agent 
Moline testified at Montoya's trial that he reviewed 55,000 pages of Montoya's 
financial records. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said that at least two contributors who received the IRS letter 
complained to him about the government request. "I tend to be more 
philosophical," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to copies of more than 50 of his bills subpoenaed by the 
investigators last year, Robbins said, he has provided boxes of message slips, 
copies of canceled checks and deposit slips to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"I've provided them with enough material that they had to send a guy over with 
a dolly to get it," Robbins said.

SANTA CLARITA ENDS POWER PLANT DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ARCO AGREES TO PROTECT AIR AND WATER QUALITY IN A PACT MADE DAYS 
BEFORE THE CITY'S SUIT WAS EXPECTED TO BE DECIDED. 
</P>

<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council approved a settlement Wednesday that will end a 
2-year-old legal dispute and allow Arco Oil and Gas Co. to operate a power 
plant in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the company agreed to extensive environmental controls designed to 
protect the air and water. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came days before the state Court of Appeal was expected to decide 
on a lawsuit aimed at blocking the $35-million project. City Manager George 
Caravalho said both sides were unsure how the court might rule and agreed to 
the pact early Wednesday after several hours of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations continued even as the council held its regular meeting Tuesday 
night. "We received faxed drafts of the agreement during the meeting," 
Caravalho said. While the council plodded through a lengthy agenda, attorneys 
for the city and company huddled in the back of the council chambers, revising 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The power plant, at Sierra Highway and Placerita Canyon Road, has been under 
attack ever since Santa Clarita was incorporated in December, 1987. At its 
first meeting, the City Council passed a moratorium to try to block its 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
While the new city was still organizing itself, Los Angeles County released 
building permits for the plant to Tenneco Oil Co., which guided the project 
until Tenneco was purchased by Arco more than a year ago. The city said the 
permits violated the moratorium and ordered Arco to stop construction. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge said Arco could not be punished for the 
county's error and ordered Santa Clarita to let the project proceed. The city 
appealed in court. Wednesday's agreement ends the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Arco and Tenneco will spend about $1.8 million to install 
extra monitoring equipment, redesign the project and pay the city's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho said the pact addresses the city's main concerns about the plant, 
which will produce oil and electricity. The company will pump steam into the 
ground to loosen and force oil to the surface. The steam also will drive 
electrical generators. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's an agreement we certainly can live with and one the citizens of 
the Santa Clarita Valley can live with," said Al Greenstein, an Arco spokesman. 
"We will be a good neighbor with this power plant." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement addresses noise, water, air quality, odors, lighting and the 
appearance of the plant. It formally recognizes the company's right to complete 
the plant and the city's right to pass the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Arco is to provide quarterly reports on the quality of the ground water near 
the plant. If, after two years, the analysis reveals no contamination from the 
power plant, Arco will test the water annually. 
</P>
<P>
Caravalho said the monitoring is vital because the city receives 50% of its 
water from local sources. 
</P>
<P>
Arco agreed to install equipment to monitor noise and odors. Tenneco will pay 
Santa Clarita up to $125,000 to cover the city's legal expenses in the battle. 
Arco is prohibited from building another plant within five miles of the 
existing facility. In return, the city agrees to issue any permits needed to 
complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Placerita Canyon Property Owners Assn. had charged in an unsuccessful legal 
attack on the plant that the county should have required an environmental 
impact report for it. The state Supreme Court in October let stand an appellate 
court ruling against the association.

HAWTHORNE TENTATIVELY CHOOSES SUCCESSOR FOR RETIRING CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council has tentatively selected Public Works Director James 
H. Mitsch to replace retiring City Manager R. Kenneth Jue. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch was chosen to be the next city manager during a closed-door session 
Monday, according to city officials. Jue, who has been with the city for 24 
years, notified the council two weeks ago that he will retire effective Dec. 
31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to confirm Mitsch's selection at its Jan. 22 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Jue, 57, became city manager in 1977 after being city engineer for 11 years and 
working 13 years as assistant engineer with the city of Inglewood. Jue, who 
recommended Mitsch as his replacement, said he wants to retire while he is 
young enough to enjoy some of his favorite pastimes -- such as woodcraft and 
motorcycle riding. 
</P>
<P>
Jue's annual salary is $105,000, and he will retire with a yearly pension of 
about $66,000, according to Doug Gates, Hawthorne's personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch came to the city in 1966 as assistant city engineer and has held several 
positions at City Hall, including city engineer. He was also acting city 
manager for almost a year in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews this week, city officials said Mitsch is the best qualified to 
succeed Jue and that they expect a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
City officials characterized Mitsch as a highly qualified replacement who 
understands the city's inner workings and who knows how to stay clear of 
internal political squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
"He works well with everybody," Jue said. "It should be a smooth transition." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginny Lambert agreed. "He's the very best person to fill Kenny 
Jue's shoes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mitsch's role in City Hall has not always been free of controversy. A 
county grand jury criticized him in 1983, saying a local engineering company he 
owned posed a potential conflict of interest. In 1987, he was suspended by the 
city when it was learned that he still owned the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch later sold the company, and city officials said this week that the 
conflict-of-interest allegations have been put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Jue received accolades for his years of service to the city. Jue -- who is 
regarded by his City Hall colleagues as a quiet and reserved man -- is also 
known as a hard worker who is respected and admired by his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said Jue has done an excellent job as city manager. 
She praised him for helping to organize several redevelopment projects that are 
about to start in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said she is happy the council decided to hire a replacement from 
within City Hall. "I've been here long enough to know that when you promote 
from within, it makes it a smoother transition and the employees are happier," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jue's tenure with the city has been generally characterized in glowing 
terms, he has had some difficult times, too. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Jue came under fire by some staff members and city activists when he 
recommended that the city lay off as many as 32 employees to resolve an 
anticipated $2.5-million budget deficit for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis stemmed from an unexpected drop in revenue from sales 
taxes and paramedic fees, according to city officials. To avert the layoffs, 
the City Council voted in August to increase numerous municipal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said this week that city officials will need to find new ways to pay for a 
proposal to hire at least five new police officers to help fight the city's 
increasing crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
Jue and Mitsch have had a long-term off-duty business relationship. For at 
least eight years they have been co-owners of an Inglewood apartment building. 
In addition, Mitsch once owned Centinela Valley Engineering, a Hawthorne firm 
founded by Jue. Jue divested himself of the firm two years before Mitsch 
acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsch's difficulties began in 1983, when a Los Angeles County grand jury in a 
report on Hawthorne government criticized his involvement with Centinela Valley 
Engineering as a possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Mitsch denied that Centinela Valley Engineering did any surveys in 
Hawthorne, but Jue said there were indications that the firm had conducted 
surveys in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Jue said that after the grand jury report was released he told Mitsch to sever 
all ties with the company. But in August, 1987, after learning that Mitsch had 
continued to work with Centinela Valley Engineering, Jue suspended him for 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews this week, both Jue and Mitsch said the problems surrounding the 
engineering company have been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was put to bed," Jue said of the matter. "He got a penalty and he divested 
himself" of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mitsch: "It's been resolved."

POSTAL WORKER SUSPECTED OF THREATS PLACED ON LEAVE; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: OFFICIALS WANT TO KNOW IF AN EMPLOYEE WAS MAKING THREATS WHEN HE 
ALLEGEDLY REFERRED TO LAST YEAR'S SHOOTING RAMPAGE BY A LATTER CARRIER IN 
ESCONDIDO.

<P>
A San Marcos letter carrier has been placed on leave after a weekend incident 
in which he allegedly threatened fellow employees by making a reference to last 
summer's shooting rampage by a mailman in Escondido, postal officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure he threatened anybody's life, to be honest with you," said Neil 
Kruck, the San Marcos postmaster. "But everybody's a little jumpy after that 
thing in Escondido." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 10, letter carrier John Merlin Taylor killed his wife, then drove to 
the Orange Glen substation and murdered two co-workers before turning the gun 
on himself. Taylor's death was one of eight postal-related suicides or murders 
in San Diego County in 1989, according to testimony in a congressional hearing 
last month in San Diego . 
</P>
<P>
Kruck said the name of the letter carrier has not been divulged, and the man, 
who is in his late 30s and has a family, is "freaked out" that word of the 
incident ever reached the media. Kruck described him as a postal employee of 
long standing, with a good record. He said the man has been ordered not to give 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kruck said the incident began Saturday morning at the San Marcos post office in 
the 400 block of North Twin Oaks Valley Road. He said fellow employees began 
heckling the man and it "accelerated to where he got upset at the things being 
said and then made this remark." 
</P>
<P>
Kruck said he did not know the exact wording of what the man said, "but some 
people seemed to think he had threatened their lives. That's what we're trying 
to determine right now." 
</P>
<P>
Kruck said that, when the man reported to work Monday morning, he was searched 
for weapons by two agents of the Postal Inspection Service, "who immediately 
began an investigation." He said the man was sent home on administrative leave, 
meaning that he will be paid pending the outcome of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had happened a year ago, nothing would have happened," Kruck said. 
"But everyone is real jumpy and anxious nowadays because of all that's been 
happening around here. I'm not real close with this carrier, but he's never 
caused problems in the past. He is not someone with a history of disciplinary 
problems. And, as far as being teased, he does seem to dish it out as well as 
he takes it." 
</P>
<P>
Kruck said any employee making a direct threat to a co-worker can be fired 
immediately, "but I don't believe this falls within that category." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cannone, spokesman for San Diego County Postmaster Margaret Sellers, said 
three employees of the San Marcos post office called postal headquarters on 
Midway Drive Saturday to complain about the incident. Cannone said those who 
called reported the man threatened them "by alluding to the Taylor killings." 
Cannone said he had not heard an exact quote of what the man said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hearing that the man was disciplined, but that simply isn't true," 
Cannone said. "He's on paid leave, but coincidentally, he had a three-week 
vacation coming up anyway, so he might not be back at work for at least another 
month." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers in Escondido declined 
comment.

RANCHO P.V. COUNCIL TO BE INVOLVED EARLY IN PROPOSED BUILDING PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move aimed at avoiding major disputes between builders and the 
city, Rancho Palos Verdes has embarked on an experiment that calls for council 
members to get involved early in the planning of major developments. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment marks a major departure in protocol for the council and comes at 
a time when development issues dominate local political debate. A handful of 
major proposals, including a controversial plan for a luxury hotel and homes at 
the former Marineland site, are now before the city. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, council members approve the overall street, lot and other design 
features of a project, but do not get involved further unless the developer or 
someone else files an appeal seeking to overturn a Planning Commission 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Under the three-month experiment, however, the council will hold public 
workshops twice a month with the city's planning commissioners, developers and 
interested residents. The workshops are designed to give city officials a 
chance to study a particular project and voice any concerns they might have 
while it is still in the early conceptual stages. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid potential legal problems, the city will not require a developer to 
participate in a workshop. And neither the developer nor city officials are 
bound by any suggestions that might emerge from a workshop on how a particular 
project should be shaped. 
</P>
<P>
"As I perceive it, the fundamental purpose is to give the City Council and 
Planning Commission an opportunity to give input into a project before (the 
developer) comes in with formalized plans and hundreds of hours of detail 
work," Mayor Mel Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to that point, there is so much inertia in a project, they only 
grudgingly move from one position to another." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Ariel Calonne said he is unaware of any other city where council 
members have initiated such workshops. However, he said they are similar in 
concept to meetings held by city officials before environmental impact reports 
and general plans are prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The city has scheduled two workshops a month for the next three months. Council 
members will then decide if more workshops should be held, or if the idea 
should be scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, about 40 people showed up for the first workshop, which was 
held to discuss a proposal by Los Angeles-based Kajima Development Corp. to 
build 76 homes on 59 acres overlooking McCarroll Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The site just south of Crest Road and west of Highridge Road had originally 
been zoned for more than 120 housing units by Los Angeles County before Rancho 
Palos Verdes was incorporated in the early '70s and the zoning was changed to 
decrease the allowable density. 
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, several residents said they were fearful that the project 
could contribute to erosion and flooding problems in the canyon, while others 
said they were concerned that the homes would be grouped too closely together. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, several city officials said they thought the workshop had been 
beneficial. Eileen Suto, who is overseeing the project for Kajima, expressed 
optimism that her company's plan would face smoother sailing because of the 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they hope the workshops will help to avoid the sometimes 
colossal misunderstandings that have erupted between the city and developers. 
Some developers have spent months or years guiding projects through the city's 
planning processes before discovering that council members were opposed to 
major aspects of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach pointed to a developer's plan, first 
filed with the city in 1987, to build homes on 64 acres across from Marineland. 
</P>
<P>
After spending months designing the project, the developer received approval 
from the Planning Commission but was rebuffed by council members, who 
ultimately called for the project to be scaled down and redesigned. It took the 
developer more than two years to receive final approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the council, and the council wanted just the reverse that the 
Planning Commission wanted," Bacharach said. 
</P>
<P>
Luella Wike, who chairs the Planning Commission, said she believes the 
workshops could prove helpful for commissioners because it will give them a 
better idea how council members feel about a particular project. The workshops 
could also assist developers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is much fairer to the developer if he finds out right off the bat 
his project won't fly," Wike said. 
</P>
<P>
Wike and other city officials said commissioners and council members will have 
to tread carefully during the workshops and not discuss a project in such 
detail that they could be accused by a developer of prejudging it even before 
public hearings on it have been held. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it is important that residents affected by a particular project not be 
excluded from the workshops, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the primary concern is protecting the due process rights of both the 
project applicants and members of the public," Calonne said. 
</P>
<P>
Calonne said guidelines established for the workshops provide that, if 
residents living within 500 feet of a proposed project would normally have been 
notified of the project by the city, they will also be told if a workshop has 
been scheduled.

To protect the developer's rights, Calonne said the city decided to make 
participation in the workshops voluntary.

<P>
Also, a developer is not required to comply with any suggestions made by city 
officials during the workshop and can withdraw the application for a project 
and get a refund on any fees paid if he or she objects to what transpires

HERMOSA BEACH TO STAND FIRM ON PCH PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway through Hermosa Beach -- where every 
rush hour means a traffic jam -- won't be any less a bottleneck in the '90s 
than it is right now, the Hermosa Beach City Council decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting a report from a consultant hired to tell the city how to ease 
congestion on its cramped thoroughfares, the council indicated Tuesday that 
Hermosa Beach won't join two other South Bay beach cities in banning rush-hour 
parking along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses along the street and residents made it clear that they opposed 
easing the bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if they can't get through our town," said Wilma Bird, a Hermosa 
Beach resident for 30 years. "If they can't get through Hermosa, maybe they'll 
go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the city's acceptance of parked cars on the busy thoroughfare has 
created one of the South Bay's more notorious bottlenecks, pinching the highway 
from three lanes in adjacent cities into two lanes in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The signal that the stall and crawl will continue came in the form of a council 
straw vote at a public hearing on General Plan recommendations for traffic and 
parking. The recommendations -- submitted by city planners, the Planning 
Commission and the consultant, DKS &amp; Associates -- were to help the council 
decide how the city should accommodate traffic in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But despite advice from both the consultant and the Planning Commission to ban 
rush-hour parking on the venerable beach highway, the council instead followed 
the call of residents and local merchants. Packing the meeting room, the 
homeowners said Hermosa Beach should make it harder, not easier, for 
out-of-town commuters to cut through their city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Bird of the Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, said that if Hermosa Beach 
eliminates its parking lane on Pacific Coast Highway, even for a few hours a 
day, the move will ruin business for the merchants along the thoroughfare. They 
depend on residents having easy access to parking and not on commuters who stop 
as they drive through the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council also gave an unofficial thumbs-down to suggested improvements and 
widening of the two streets flanking the greenbelt, which runs parallel to 
Pacific Coast Highway, since they often absorb the overflow from the highway 
during the morning and evening commuter rush.

IF BOND PASSES, BUDGET WOULD BOOST CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the state budget proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday, El 
Camino College would receive $6.3 million to double the size of its main 
library and $1.4 million to build a day-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills would get $372,000 to re-equip its library under the 
draft budget, a $53.7-billion state spending plan for the fiscal year that 
begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a catch. Those allocations are predicated on legislative and voter 
approval this year of a $900-million higher education bond issue, officials 
with the governor's office point out. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have to go back to the drawing board if the bond issue doesn't pass," 
said Jordan Montano, a higher education specialist with Gov. Deukmejian's 
finance office. 
</P>
<P>
The $6.3-million El Camino College library allocation would be used to add a 
second floor to the facility so it can accommodate 1,000 students and 300,000 
books. Currently, the library's capacity is 500 students and 125,000 books, 
college spokeswoman Mary Ann Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.4 million for a day-care center would finance construction of a 
one-story building on what is now a parking lot south of the campus, across 
Redondo Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the center is scheduled to begin next fall, and construction of the 
library addition is slated to start sometime in 1991, according to Don 
Sorsabal, the college's vice president of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsabal said the day-care center would eventually accommodate 140 infants and 
preschool youngsters, with children of El Camino College students receiving 
priority for admission. Students in the college's child development program 
would teach preschoolers at the center as part of their training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our students doing teaching outside at private institutions," Sorsabal 
said. "This would allow us to bring them into an atmosphere over which we have 
complete control." 
</P>
<P>
The $372,000 capital allocation for Cal State Dominguez Hills would pay for the 
purchase of computers, book stacks, desks, chairs, and other equipment and 
furniture as part of a $1.2-million library remodeling program. A great deal of 
space at the cramped library is taken up by administrative offices, which are 
being moved out as part of the remodeling work, according to university 
spokesman Greg Klerkx. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian's budget also includes $752,000 to buy equipment for a planned 
vocational training center and $12.8 million for construction of a sports 
complex at Southwest Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bernard Ancheta, the college's vice president for administration, 
the sports facility is scheduled to be built by the spring of 1991 and will 
include three basketball courts, four racquetball courts, a weight training 
room and 10 tennis courts.

A bicyclist riding on Murphy Canyon Road found the body of a woman in roadside 
shrubbery Wednesday, San Diego police said.

The unidentified body had suffered "apparent trauma to the head" and was found

of Interstate 15, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. It was not clear how 
long the body had been there, he said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRIME HITS HOME FOR MOCK'S WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The problems of crime struck home for Torrance City Councilman Tim Mock on 
Friday when his wife's purse was snatched from inside their house as she 
unloaded groceries from her car. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Mock told police that she first saw the thief standing in front of a 
liquor store at Crenshaw Boulevard and 166th Street, about one block from her 
house, as she drove home from the store about 8 p.m., and that he apparently 
followed her from there. 
</P>
<P>
Mock, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, said his wife had 
carried one load of groceries and her purse into the house, closed the door and 
returned to the car for more when she heard her daughter yelling about a 
strange man in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Mock ran back in time to see the man she had noticed in front of the 
liquor store running out her front door with her purse in his hand.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONVICTION IN HOME-BUYING SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood couple, who promised to build homes at bargain-basement prices for 
low-income investors, pleaded no contest to embezzlement charges and agreed to 
repay a total of $43,000 to as many as 60 would-be homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Seroy and Jacqueline Flowers, who formed Flowers Home Club in 1987, entered the 
plea last Friday in Torrance Superior Court to six counts each of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who paid half of the restitution that day, were placed on four 
years' probation by Judge Cecil J. Mills and ordered to make payments of at 
least $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
If they fail to meet that schedule, each could go to prison for up to six 
years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Burke. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Flowers and his 27-year-old wife promised to build homes for 
members of the home club for no money down and about $1,000 a month, club 
members said. Members of the predominantly black club said that Seroy Flowers 
appealed to them by invoking the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and 
saying: "He took you to the bottom of the mountain, but I'm going to take you 
to the mountaintop." 
</P>
<P>
Flowers Home Club members invested from a few hundred dollars to as much as 
$4,000, but Flowers didn't build a single house, Inglewood police said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEEUWENBURGH TO SEEK THIRD TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh said Monday that she will seek 
another term on the council this spring, after announcing earlier that she 
would not. 
</P>
<P>
The two-term councilwoman said she originally decided not to run again because 
of the time-consuming responsibilities of caring for her mother, who has had 
Alzheimer's disease for several years. 
</P>
<P>
However, a doctor has recommended that her mother, who lived with the 
councilwoman, be admitted to a care center, thereby giving her more time for 
city business, Leeuwenburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Leeuwenburgh's council seat, two others, held by Jody Murdoch and 
Gordana Swanson, are open in the April 10 election.

QUESTIONING GROWS HEATED IN EXTORTION TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
THREATS: A PROSECUTOR ADMITS HE "FIRED NO FATAL ARROWS" DURING THE TRIAL OF TWO 
MEN WHO ARE CHARGED WITH MAILING HUNDREDS OF "PAY OR DIE" LETTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor spent three hours Wednesday grilling one of two men accused of 
mailing hundreds of extortion letters to prominent Antelope Valley residents 
last year, alleging that the defendants made an abrupt trip to the East Coast 
in order to construct an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during several combative exchanges in San Fernando Superior Court, 
defendant Richard Faroni appeared to contradict testimony by his father that 
the defendants gave little advance notice of their trip to Faroni's Connecticut 
hometown during the period in late 1988 when the letters were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley acknowledged Wednesday that he "fired 
no fatal arrows" during the cross-examination of Faroni, a former Lancaster 
aerospace technician who faces charges of attempted extortion and conspiracy 
along with former co-worker Roman Makuch. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William A. Clark said the prosecution assault backfired when 
Cooley produced phone company records to counter Faroni's claim that he called 
his parents frequently. Faroni responded that he had used a long distance 
company; Cooley later conceded that investigators had not obtained records for 
that company. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said: "I call that putting yourself out on a limb and getting it hacked 
off by someone with a chain saw." 
</P>
<P>
Cooley's duel with Faroni, who served as an Army communications expert because 
of his exceptional intelligence and memory, produced the most exciting day of 
the month-old trial. Cooley hammered away at the account of a trip from Las 
Vegas to Connecticut, where the defendants spent about 10 days, putting them 
out of town on Oct. 31, 1988. Prosecutors believe an accomplice mailed the 
letters that day after Makuch and Faroni had prepared them. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley suggested it was more than coincidence that Faroni called an 
acquaintance in Los Angeles from Connecticut on Oct. 31, noting the 
acquaintance told investigators that Faroni left a message that the call was 
urgent but then "just talked about the weather." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it a fact that you were trying to establish a telephonic record of your 
whereabouts, an independent record with an independent witness?" Cooley 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I would do that," Faroni responded. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley cited preliminary hearing testimony by Faroni's father, Richard Faroni 
Sr., to attack Faroni's assertion that his father asked him to come home in a 
phone call a week before the trip. The elder Faroni did not mention asking his 
son to visit, testifying that the younger Faroni gave no prior warning other 
than a phone call Oct. 25 announcing he would be arriving in two days for his 
first visit since May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy shows the trip was intended to provide an out-of-town alibi, 
Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen questioned Faroni about his possession of two CB radios of 
the type victims were instructed to purchase in the extortion letters, which 
demanded millions of dollars. No money was ever collected. 
</P>
<P>
Faroni testified Tuesday that he bought the radios as gifts for family members 
in Connecticut but forgot to bring them. On Wednesday, he told Coen he was 
unable to pick up the radios from storage because he and Makuch stopped to help 
victims of a car accident on the day of their flight. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley called the testimony inconsistent, saying, "They are trying to 
disassociate themselves from the radios because the radios would have been 
essential to the extortion plot."

EL CAMINO HOLDS OFF PASADENA'S SECOND-HALF SURGE TO WIN, 85-74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino lost its South Coast Conference basketball opener to a mediocre team 
on Saturday, but last night the Warriors got revenge with an 85-74 victory over 
Pasadena at the Lancer gym. 
</P>
<P>
For one half the seventh-ranked Warriors (15-5, 1-1) took it out on the 
Lancers, who made an incredible second-half effort to save their SCC opener. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (10-11, 0-1) found it difficult to keep up with El Camino's intense 
defense and fast-paced offense. The Warriors scored 12 unanswered points early 
in the game, which put them ahead 18-5 with 13:35 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later El Camino went on a nine-point run capped by freshman 
Michael Houck's three-point play that gave the Warriors a 27-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's virtually non-existant shooting and an array of turnovers in the 
first half assisted El Camino which held a 41-28 halftime edge. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors kept the streak going for the first part of the second half. With 
14:34 left to play El Camino had a comfortable 21-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps El Camino got too comfortable because Pasadena shaved the lead to six 
after David Phillips' three-point shot with 1:01 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino will travel to Cerritos for Saturday's SCC game at 7:30 p.m. IRENE

GOAT BECOMES THE HERO AS MONTGOMERY NIPS SERVITE 
</P>

<P>
Bishop Montgomery High guard Kirk Jones went from goat to hero as he hit a 
three-point shot with 33 seconds left in overtime to give Bishop Montgomery a 
47-46 win over Servite on Wednesday night at Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery (11-3) recorded its second straight Angelus League victory 
without a loss after dropping 38 straight. Servite, ranked No. 9 in the CIF 
Southern Section 3-AA, fell to 8-7 overall and 0-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
With seven seconds to go in regulation time, Bishop Montgomery was tied with 
the Friars, 41-41, and junior guard Jones stood at the free throw line after 
being fouled while shooting with a chance to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
With a rowdy Servite home crowd jeering, Jones missed both free throws, forcing 
the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones saved the Knights as he drilled a three-point shot with :33 left in 
the overtime, giving Bishop Montgomery its 47-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people would say to take Jones out after missing those free throws," 
Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell said. "But he's a tough kid, I knew he 
would come back." 
</P>
<P>
Jones' three points were the only points he made all night, but they came at 
the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a defensive player, but if I have to make a shot I'll do it," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' heroics were set up by senior Darrell Daniel, who scored a game-high 27 
points, more than half of the Knights' total. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say about Darrell Daniel?" Mitchell asked. "You can say he 
virtually slayed the Friars by himself, but he will correct you." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of confidence in our team," Daniel said. "We were a little 
confused, but then we started knocking the shots down." 
</P>
<P>
Servite led 13-6 after the first quarter and 23-18 at halftime. The Friars were 
frustrating the Knight offense and patiently wearing down the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter began with a 6-0 Servite spurt, making the score 29-18, but 
Daniel led a Knight charge, scoring 13 points in the quarter, including five 
consecutive baskets to give Bishop Montgomery a 35-34 lead with one quarter to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Servite led in the overtime, 44-41, but Daniel hit a 22-foot three-point shot 
to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
Servite sophomore forward Adam Anderson hit two free throws after Daniel's 
shot, making the score 46-44 Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's free throws were followed by Jones' dramatic bomb, sparking a wild 
victory celebration by the Knights and a happy ride home through the Orange 
County fog. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 65, Pius X 53 -- Senior guard Scott Panfil scored 27 points, 
including four three-point shots, and center Ken Talanoa added 14 points and 14 
rebounds at El Segundo to lead the Eagles to their first Camino Real League 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (7-8 overall, 1-2 in league play) opened a 17-4 lead but Pius X 
managed to stay within striking range and got as close as eight points in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a win badly," said El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky, whose team opened 
its first season in the competitive league with losses to St. Bernard and St. 
Monica. "We played well and played hard for the most part." 
</P>
<P>
Panfil hit several baskets down the stretch to help the Eagles maintain a 
comfortable margin. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Rod Titus paced Pius X with 15 points.

St. Anthony 69, Serra 66 -- St. Anthony stole an inbounds pass and scored a 
layup in the final seconds of the fourth quarter to tie the game, and the 
Saints won it in overtime at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by one point with 11 seconds left in regulation, Serra went to the 
free-throw line after St. Anthony was called for a technical foul. Serra made 
one of two free throws but lost the ball on the inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Serra guard Steven Johnson hit a three-point shot to tie the 
contest, 66-66. St. Anthony then broke the Cavaliers' press and converted a 
three-point play. Johnson's last-second three-point shot was off target. 
</P>
<P>
Serra dropped to 5-6 overall and 1-2 in the Camino Real League, while St. 
Anthony stayed in first place at 3-0.

VALLEY PUTS BRAKES TO SANTA MONICA'S WIN STREAK 
</P>

<P>
The words "Back to back Western State Conference champions" hang prominently 
below the scoreboard in the Santa Monica College gym. 
</P>
<P>
But any notions of "Threepeat" might be a bit premature for the Santa Monica 
men's basketball team after Valley snapped the Corsairs' 29-game conference 
winning streak with a 79-69 victory Wednesday night at Santa Monica. Valley 
improved to 3-0 in conference play, 12-8 overall; Santa Monica fell to 18-4, 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Valley had lost to Santa Monica in the championship game of the Antelope Valley 
tournament last month. However, the Monarchs were without the services of 
6-foot-5, 210-pound forward Shelton Boykin, who missed the game because of an 
ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
But Boykin (13 points) was back this time and made his presence felt early with 
a tomahawk dunk over a defender off the break and then hit a short jump shot in 
traffic during a 30-second span in the first half to give Valley an 18-7 
advantage at the 14:22 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"We were confident," Stephens said. "We're playing a lot better now and we're 
playing together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Valley led, 54-42, with 16 minutes remaining, but Santa Monica closed to within 
62-60 with 7:40 to play on Chico Langston's breakaway layup. 
</P>
<P>
Valley's Erik McDaniels then hit two outside jump shots and Steve Ward tipped 
in a rebound as the Monarchs scored six unanswered points to squelch Santa 
Monica's rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs cut the lead to five, 74-69, with 51 seconds left, but sophomore 
guard Andre Harrell hit four consecutive free throws to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"(Santa Monica) is a good team," Stephens said. "They're tough, we knew they 
were going to come back. They don't give up. We had some turnovers near the 
end, but we we're able to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
Ward led Valley scorers with 19 points and Harrell added 14. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's Mark Moton scored 16 points and Donald Smith had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Valley jumped to a 12-3 advantage after 2 minutes, 45 seconds of play and never 
trailed thereafter. Santa Monica cut the lead to three, 25-22, with 10:09 left 
in the first half, but Valley went on a 7-0 run to increase its advantage to 10 
during a 2:34 span and led 45-38 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Valley will meet Glendale, which defeated Canyons in overtime 
Wednesday, 91-88.

ROLLING HILLS IS OFF TO AN 0-3 START -- HAVE THE MIGHTY FALLEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It appears the party is over for the Rolling Hills High basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-year reign as Bay League champion, the Titans are off to an 0-3 
start following a 68-65 loss Tuesday at Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like we can contend for the championship right now," Coach 
Cliff Warren said. "It would be too hard to win a lot of games in a row. 
Someone always starts winning. In the past, it's always been us." 
</P>
<P>
Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's defeat marked the first time in five seasons under Warren that the 
Titans have lost three consecutive games. They entered the season with a 41-5 
league record under Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (8-7 overall) has already matched the most losses suffered by a 
Warren Titan team in the regular season: 21-7 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
Warren blames poor defense and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest reason is defense," he said. "We're not playing aggressive enough. 
And we're not rebounding. We don't get a lot of second shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take our weakest points and move them up a notch. We have to play 
strong and hard. We're trying not to get discouraged. I'm an optimist. I don't 
get discouraged easily, but this is testing me." 
</P>
<P>
Looking on the bright side, Warren said the first high school team he coached, 
in 1963 at El Segundo, also lost three straight games but went on to capture 
the CIF-Southern Section 2-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills will try to end its skid tonight, but it won't be easy. The 
Titans play at Bay League co-leader Hawthorne, which has won 10 of its last 13 
games and thrives on aggressive, full-court defense. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot in Rolling Hills' loss Tuesday was the shooting 
performance of guard Steve Clover, who set the CIF-Southern Section record for 
career three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Clover, a 6-foot-4 senior headed for Pepperdine, sank five three-pointers 
against Inglewood to give him 228 in his three-year varsity career, eclipsing 
the record of 224 set by Glendora's Tracy Murray, now a freshman at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Clover is also on a pace to break Murray's single-season record of 125 
three-pointers, set last year. He has 80 in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a more balanced basketball team in the area than Morningside? 
</P>
<P>
Entering this week, four Monarchs were averaging double figures in points: 
guards Tyrone Paul (16.7) and Martel Bland (14.7), center Jeff Crowe (14) and 
forward Arthur Savage (11.4). 
</P>
<P>
Bland, a 6-4 senior, has been the biggest surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to be the team's sixth man, he moved into the starting lineup a week 
before the season when Daniel Taylor suffered a broken index finger in a 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Bland has made the most of the opportunity, spearheading the Monarchs' press 
and becoming their best outside shooter. He leads the team in steals, averaging 
six a game, and he set a school record with seven three-point shots against 
Brea-Olinda in the Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, he's our best overall athlete," Co-Coach Ron Randle said. "He 
combines defense, athletic ability and a great knowledge of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bland's greatest strength is defense. He draws the opposing team's top 
offensive player and has shut down several explosive shooters, including 
Rolling Hills' Clover, whom he held to a season-low eight points in the 
semifinals of the Pacific Shores Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Said Randle: "He gives us that extra dimension that we need to be a very good 
basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
First place in the Ocean League basketball race will be up for grabs at 7:30 
Friday night when Mira Costa plays host to Morningside. The co-leaders have 3-0 
league records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most exciting game in the Ocean League, at least in the first half 
(of league play)," Morningside's Randle said. "I think our kids are building 
for it. Mira Costa is confident, so we'll have to come out and play good 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
A key matchup figures to be Mira Costa's 6-8 tandem of Chris Davis and Mike 
Ashenfelter against Morningside's front line of 6-7 Crowe, 6-6 Savage and 6-5 
Paul. If Mira Costa can't get the ball inside to its big people, it could be a 
long night because of Morningside's quickness and tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter has become a bonanza for Mira Costa in league play. Through 
three games, the Mustangs have outscored opponents, 43-19, in the third 
quarter, including 17-7 Tuesday in a 60-46 win over Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Glenn Marx must be doing something right at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Frankie White is a senior, Miraleste basketball Coach Todd Mirsky 
believes the sophomore will be the best point guard in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
"He handles the ball so well," Mirsky said. "He still needs work on his 
judgment, but he's fearless. He'll penetrate against anyone. When he gets a 
little bigger and stronger, he's going to be something." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-11 White, son of former Harbor College basketball Coach Jim White, isn't 
bad right now. He ranks second in the South Bay in assists, averaging 9.4 a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- West Torrance High cross-country Coach Greg Houlgate, a former 
distance running standout at Bishop Montgomery, is entered in the 12th annual 
Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10-K Run on Jan. 28. Houlgate first attracted 
attention by setting the national 10-K record for 13-year-olds (33:59), which 
has since been broken. He is training for the 1992 U.S. Olympic team . . . Two 
South Bay preps have been added to the field for the 31st Sunkist Invitational 
Indoor track meet on Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena. Maria Maldonado of Leuzinger 
will compete in the girls' mile and Torrance's Israel Pose, a junior who placed 
29th in the Kinney Western Regional cross-country championships, will run the 
boys' two mile . . . Miraleste's basketball team, which sank only three 
three-point shots in 22 games last season, has made 16 in 14 games, led by 
forward Jeff Goldstein with 12. The Marauders improved to 3-0 in the Alpha 
League and 7-7 overall Tuesday with a 54-37 win over L.A. Baptist . . . Verbum 
Dei beat St. Bernard, 76-61, Tuesday night in a Camino Real League basketball 
game at Compton College to avenge a 74-63 loss suffered at the hands of the 
Vikings last month in the Las Vegas Valley Tournament.

 Loyola Marymount's Bo Kimble was named Windex College Player of the Week after 
scoring 38, 54 and 32 points in road games, including a 35-footer at the buzzer 
to beat St. Joseph's of Philadelphia, 99-96. He leads the nation in scoring at 
37.4 and is averaging 44.6 points and 9.5 rebounds in his last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa guard Chris Hobbs scored 20 of his game-high 30 points in the second 
half Tuesday to help the Mustangs erase a 26-24 halftime deficit and defeat 
Centennial, 60-46. It was Mira Costa's seventh straight win and kept the team 
tied for first in the Ocean League at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's press claimed another victim Tuesday as the Cougars forced 22 
turnovers against Santa Monica and won, 73-54, to remain in a first-place tie 
in the Bay League at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie and Janet Davis combined for 34 points and 23 rebounds to lead 
Morningside's girls basketball team to its 75th straight Ocean League victory 
Tuesday over West Torrance, 91-49. 
</P>
<P>
Who's Not 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills' basketball team, three-time defending Bay League champion, fell 
to Inglewood, 68-65, Tuesday to open league play with an 0-3 record. It marks 
the first time in five seasons under Coach Cliff Warren that the Titans have 
lost three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball team made just six of 24 field-goal 
attempts in the first half of Saturday's 58-44 loss to Biola. The Toros (4-9) 
take a two-game losing streak into Friday's game at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance's basketball team was outscored, 42-13, in the first half Tuesday 
en route to a 92-45 Ocean League loss to Morningside. The Warriors dropped to 
2-9 overall and 0-3 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance's hopes for a turnaround this season appear in jeopardy after 
the Saxons suffered their fifth consecutive loss, 67-54, to Redondo, falling to 
0-3 in the Ocean League and 5-9 overall.

MOORPARK BACK, KICKER LEAD NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freddie Bradley and Sean Cheevers of Moorpark College each ranked at the top of 
categories in final national junior college football statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a second-team All-American running back, scored 23 regular-season 
touchdowns and averaged 13.8 points a game to finish No. 1 in scoring average. 
The freshman was 13th in the country in rushing with 126.6 yards per game and 
ninth in all-purpose running with 169.6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cheevers, a sophomore, was the leading scorer among kickers. He made 40 extra 
points and 12 of 15 field-goal attempts to average 7.6 points. He also topped 
active kickers in career scoring average (7.4 points). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark sophomore quarterback Jayson Merrill averaged 10.7 completions a game 
to rank 41st, and he was 31st in passing efficiency with a 121.5 rating. 
</P>
<P>
Valley defensive back Sam Edwards and Glendale quarterback Ronnie Lopez were 
the only other Valley-area players to break into the top 10. Edwards tied for 
seventh in interceptions with 0.80 a game, and Lopez ranked ninth with a 136.0 
efficiency rating. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area players receiving mention included Pat Lynch of Glendale, 
42nd in receiving (4.3 catches per game); Tony Esposito of Valley, 12th in 
punting (40.5 yards per kick); Jamie Grossman of Pierce, 17th in passing (15.0 
completions per game); and Donald Dozier of Valley, 52nd in scoring (7.0 points 
per game). 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (9-2) was ranked seventh in team offense (423.7 yards) and sixth in 
team defense (183.7). 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (5-4-1) finished 21st in offense (397.5), and Valley (5-5-1) was 35th 
in defense (263.5). 
</P>
<P>
Marty Slimak, a former outfielder at College of the Canyons and UC Santa 
Barbara, has been hired as an assistant baseball coach at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Slimak, 34, was an assistant at Santa Ynez High last season. He will be 
responsible for pitchers at Cal Lutheran, Coach Rich Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep has added University of Michigan graduate assistant Kevin 
Kolcheff, 26, to its football coaching staff for next fall, the school 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Kolcheff coached Wolverine special teams for three years. At Montclair Prep, 
the former Central Michigan quarterback will coach running backs and special 
teams.

BOYKIN SILENCED BY COACH IN WAKE OF TEXAS EL PASO INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone fishing for quotes from effusive forward Shelton Boykin will be able to 
reel in plenty as long as the topic is his play at Valley College. But should 
the conversation turn to Texas El Paso, Boykin has been instructed to clam up. 
</P>
<P>
By decree of Jim Stephens, Boykin's coach at Valley, Boykin cannot speak to the 
press -- or to National Collegiate Athletic Assn. investigators -- about 
possible rules violations at UTEP until the basketball season is complete. 
</P>
<P>
A Times Valley edition feature on Boykin, in which he talked of possible 
violations, has been partly responsible for instigating an NCAA investigation 
of the UTEP basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
The brouhaha over the quotes, Stephens claims, has distracted Boykin and 
affected his play. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens said that he told NCAA investigators they would have to wait until the 
end of the season to interview Boykin. Ditto with everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Cuesta quest: A trip to San Luis Obispo for its Western State Conference opener 
turned into journey of epic proportions for the Moorpark men's basketball team, 
which never did arrive for its game against Cuesta scheduled for last Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Vans carrying the Moorpark team were traveling north on U. S. 101 when they 
were caught in a mammoth traffic jam caused by a tanker truck that overturned 
between Carpinteria and Santa Barbara at 12:53 p.m. A mere 40 gallons of fuel 
oil were spilled, but the freeway was blocked until nearly 9 p.m. The resultant 
traffic jam stretched back to Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moorpark finally escaped the 101, the team was unable to proceed north 
on a nearby frontage road because fire hoses that were being used to clean up 
the spill were stretched across the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
At that point it was nearly game time, and the reeling Raiders simply returned 
to Moorpark, ending a trip that began at 1:30 in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We left early so we'd have plenty of time in case there was traffic or 
whatever," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. Apparently, oil spills don't fall 
under the rubric of "whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The game has been rescheduled for Jan. 15 at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up injuries: Lee Smelser, basketball coach at College of the Canyons, 
might want to institute a rule prohibiting his players from playing in pick-up 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Canyons had to play without Steve Valenzuela during its own 
tournament. Valenzuela, who is averaging 16 points a game, suffered an ankle 
sprain during a pick-up game. Teammate Jeff Dorst suffered a similar injury in 
early November and has been sidelined since. 
</P>
<P>
Smelser hoped that both would be able to play in the Canyons' conference opener 
against Valley last Wednesday. Valenzuela did and scored 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are driving me crazy," Smelser lamented. "I wish they'd get a job." 
</P>
<P>
Precautionary measure: When Derrick Gathers missed Cal State Northridge's 
basketball game Friday at Southern Utah State, there was speculation that the 
6-foot-3 senior swingman had been ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, grades did have something to do with Gathers' absence. He was attending 
interim classes at CSUN in order to improve his marks from last semester -- 
grades that might jeopardize his eligibility when the spring semester starts 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wait-and-see situation," said Pete Cassidy, Northridge's coach. 
"Nothing will be final until the grades come out, and that may not be for 
another week or so." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who leads Northridge players in scoring (20.3) and rebounding (8.8), 
returned to the Matador lineup Monday night and led CSUN to a 59-37 victory 
over the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. He had game-high totals of 
20 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Guard Eugene Humphrey of Northridge can again walk without a 
limp, but he still probably will not return to CSUN's lineup for at least 
another week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, a starter who averages 9.4 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists a 
game, severely bruised his right hamstring against Cal State Sacramento on Dec. 
30. He has missed three games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very doubtful for the start of conference," Cassidy said. "He still can't 
run on it. . . . Next weekend's games are probably more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (5-8) will open the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season with 
a game at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Friday night. The Matadors will then 
travel to Cal State Bakersfield on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Next week the Matadors will play host to Cal State Dominguez Hills on Friday 
and they will play at Chapman on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rout of the week: On paper, The Master's 84-67 victory Monday over Northeastern 
Illinois -- an NCAA Division II team -- might have been a big win, but the 
Mustangs' triumph was predictable considering the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern Illinois entered the game with a 2-12 record, and one of those 
losses was a 146-51 butchering at the hands of fourth-ranked Oklahoma on Dec. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
Now that is a big win. 
</P>
<P>
Net return: Norm Chung is women's basketball coach at Cal Lutheran. John Cort 
is his assistant. So how much money could their autographs possibly be worth? 
</P>
<P>
To be exact, $5. 
</P>
<P>
That's what is won by the lucky holder of a game program bearing either of the 
pair's signatures at Cal Lutheran home games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something we do for school spirit and to help build interest at our 
games," Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
That spirit must have hit an all-time low Friday after Cal State Los Angeles 
snapped the Regal's school-record five-game win streak with an 80-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody stepped up to accept their winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Hooping it up Down Under: Steve deLaveaga, a former Cal Lutheran basketball 
star, has joined a professional basketball team in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
After leading NCAA Division II players in scoring his junior and senior 
seasons, deLaveaga originally tried out with the Lakers but ended up with the 
Nadawani club of the Southeast Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 16, deLaveaga will train with the Eastside (Melbourne) Spectres, 
with which Nadawani is affiliated, until the SBL season starts in mid-February. 
The season lasts about seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Although SBL teams are allowed to have two U. S. players, deLaveaga is the only 
U. S. player Nadawani is expected to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Identity crisis: Chris Cooke, a freshman forward on the Glendale College 
basketball team, might have thought he was hearing things when he heard his 
name called during introductions for Santa Monica on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs have a Chris Cook on their roster. Only the spelling was slightly 
different. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion didn't stop there. Santa Monica has two Marcus Websters on its 
roster. Rather, one Marcus Webster and another Marcus K. Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the percentages: In Glendale's 75-74 loss to two-time defending Western 
State Conference champion Santa Monica, the Vaqueros shot 43% from the field on 
22-of-51 shooting but were 67% (six of nine) from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning anew: The Occidental women's basketball team will open play in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference on Tuesday against 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers fell to 5-8 earlier this week after a 61-47 loss to Colorado 
College, but Coach Sue Semrau said that her team will be in the race for the 
SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne and defending co-champions Pomona and Claremont are favored and 
Redlands also is expected to challenge.

ARCHITECTURE: DESIGNER'S HOME MAKES A STATEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
On a remote peak in Jamul, designer David Klages is building a house that 
should someday rank him among San Diego's great architectural innovators. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, Klages, who once made a living doing more conventional 
landscape and building design, has dedicated himself to alternative modes of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
First came a large dome house in Ramona. Its shell was made by spraying the 
underside of an inflated fabric dome with "shotcrete," a material more commonly 
known as stucco. 
</P>
<P>
After completing that project in 1988, Klages and his wife, Donna, moved into a 
mobile home on their hilltop acreage in Jamul, and Klages began designing and 
building his dream house. 
</P>
<P>
Framing took several months. Instead of conventional wood construction, Klages' 
house is built around steel rebar and wire mesh. Walls consist of 6-inch-thick 
polystyrene -- the lightweight stuff used to package electronics equipment -- 
sandwiched between 2-inch layers of shotcrete. 
</P>
<P>
Building inspectors are doubtful when they first see Klages's designs, but they 
rally after he shows them specifications prepared by his engineer proving that 
the structures are several times stronger than they need to be. 
</P>
<P>
Klages combines his creative construction ideas with a sensitive eye for 
design. Tract housing typically covers terrain leveled by heavy equipment. 
Klages likes to work his designs around nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the house as a piece of sculpture that's grown out of these rocks," he 
said, nodding toward several granite boulders. He's wrapping a swimming pool 
around one of them, and he's designed his house around an old California live 
oak. 
</P>
<P>
To get there, you follow a rough dirt and asphalt road for a couple miles 
before turning into his driveway, a narrow, ribbon of concrete which climbs 
toward his peak at a breathtaking angle. 
</P>
<P>
Klages gave a tour of the project while a stucco crew mixed a batch of 
shotcrete. 
</P>
<P>
He led a visitor up a dirt path, to the edge of the pool, currently just a pit 
lined with a network of steel reinforcing. Behind the pool is the guest house, 
where Klages and his wife plan to live until they can afford to build the main 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Its steel framework stood against the sky like the skeleton of some latter-day 
Gothic cathedral, rebar and mesh bent to form curved walls rising to a pointed, 
Gothic peak. 
</P>
<P>
Klages decided not to use the inflatable dome method because his wife prefers 
square and rectangular rooms, not the odd floor plans that domes produce 
because they fail to easily accommodate conventional furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The guest house will have two levels: an enclosed work space and an open 
poolside entertainment area, including a fire pit, up top, and lower level 
living quarters including a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Windows in the side of the southern wall will capture spectacular views to 
Mexico. Three sets of sliding doors will open onto a cantilevered deck which 
juts precariously into a canyon like a giant diving board. 
</P>
<P>
Klages plans to move into the guest house in three or four months. He guesses 
he will have spent about $200,000 for the land, site preparation, roads and the 
600-square-foot guest house. 
</P>
<P>
Since the project is an experimental prototype, costs are not nearly as low as 
they could be eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"If we got this into mass production, costs would drop by probably 30%," Klages 
said. "Then you save probably 50% on energy and 70% on maintenance. If you look 
at a building over 30 years, mine won't need maintenance. It might need paint 
in five years, but nothing will attack it -- mold, vermin, termites." 
</P>
<P>
Klages said the house will be extremely efficient. The walls will keep 
interiors warm during winter and cool during summer. 
</P>
<P>
Windows are placed to catch low-angled winter sun. It will heat up floor tiles 
inside, which will radiate warmth after the sun has set. The walls will help 
keep the rooms warm, or, during summer, protect them from the heat outside. 
</P>
<P>
The steel-and-concrete construction is also fireproof. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of fire, "We will be the only ones here who will be able to relax 
in the pool and watch everything around us burn," Klages said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the methods don't have drawbacks. Klages doesn't know how much the 
walls might crack as the building settles. While he says the house should be 
waterproof, it hasn't yet gone through several seasons of rain. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been interest in Klages' building ideas, but no concrete 
results, other than the two homes. 
</P>
<P>
Through a friend's international consulting business, Klages proposed low-cost 
shotcrete housing for Uganda and for a Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona, 
but neither group opted for his innovative methods. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, banks -- generally not open to revolutionary designs which could 
make loans more risky -- haven't closed their doors on Klages. The dome house 
was built with conventional bank financing, he said. Klages is building the 
guest house with a loan from a relative, but hopes a conventional lender will 
finance the main house -- three telescoping structures resembling the guest 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Klages, 38, has studied the work of a variety of design innovators, including 
San Diego designer and artist James Hubbell, whose mountain complex in Santa 
Ysabel uses a steel mesh-and-concrete technique. 
</P>
<P>
A self-taught designer, Klages left college to travel the world and read books 
on his own. He began his career at 19 as a landscape designer. His heroes are 
people like Wallace Neff, the Southern California architect of the '30s and 
'40s best known for traditional home designs, but also the refiner of the 
balloon-form technology Klages used as the basis for the dome house. 
</P>
<P>
Such innovation takes a tremendous personal commitment. Klages doesn't seem 
worried that his large investment in his home might not result in commissions, 
or even a home that will retain its value in the conventional real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
There's a good chance his construction methods will never be accepted. 
Certainly, most designers who experiment with alternative modes of building 
never achieve widespread acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
But Klages doesn't care whether he becomes famous. 
</P>
<P>
"I like adventure, and I consider this adventure," he explained. "I went up the 
Amazon, I danced on tables at Carnival in Rio, and I visited the ruins at 
Macchu Picchu. 
</P>
<P>
"To do experimental stuff is one of the hardest thing. You're resisted by every 
agency. You have to really love it."

SOCIETY: IN THIS CORNER, THE LA JOLLA VERSION OF 'MEET THE PRESS'

<P>
Amid quiches and canapes, there was no place like UC San Diego Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson's home to play last week's hottest game, "Meet the Press 
Secretaries." 
</P>
<P>
Any of the 100 local guests who hoped to engage the ear of a former 
presidential press secretary found the odds quite favorable for getting his 
wish since eight of the 10 who signed on to participate in last Friday's "The 
Presidency, the Press and the People" symposium on the university campus were 
on hand at the Thursday reception. 
</P>
<P>
James Brady and Jody Powell were no-shows, but NBC news commentator John 
Chancellor, who served as the symposium's moderator, attended with his wife, 
Barbara, and made quite a splash with the carefully chosen list of influential 
friends of UCSD and of KPBS-TV, which taped the forum for local broadcast last 
week and for a PBS special that will air nationally later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The lights in the reception rooms inexplicably and rather entertainingly 
flickered out periodically during the evening, but with so many luminaries 
present, few people seemed to notice the blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was basically an instance of the "mingle and munch" phenomenon -- 
the press secretaries, presumably all veterans of Washington's rubber-chicken 
routine, seemed enthralled by the Ortega chili quiche -- and it revealed a side 
of Beltway protocol probably unknown to the majority of the San Diego guests. 
Presidential press secretaries, or so it would seem, prefer to stand in 
corners, a pose that evidently prevents flanking movements by impatient 
glad-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Newsman Bill Moyers, who served in the Johnson Administration, stood his ground 
in a corner of the dining room through most of the reception. Other corners 
became the temporary fiefdoms of the Ford Administration's Ron Nessen and 
Reagan's Larry Speakes. 
</P>
<P>
There were exceptions to this rule, just as some of the men did not wear bow 
ties, 
</P>
<P>
which seem to be the secretaries' sartorial secret sign. The garrulous Pierre 
Salinger, well remembered from the Kennedy years and now based in London as 
chief foreign correspondent for ABC News, roamed freely through the crowd, 
shaking hands, chatting at length and showing a preference for the toasted 
cheese canapes passed by servers. 
</P>
<P>
George Reedy, who served Lyndon Johnson and now is a professor of journalism at 
Marquette University in Milwaukee, retired early to the terrace to examine the 
inclusive view of La Jolla and its cove offered. He huddled for a while with 
Chancellor Atkinson, who came outdoors to enjoy his pipe and stayed on to give 
the bartender explicit directions in the construction of Reedy's preferred 
Martini (vodka, an olive and lots of ice). 
</P>
<P>
Conversations often turned to the headier topics of the moment, such as Panama 
(Bush Administration spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was to have participated in the 
symposium, but he canceled after the invasion), but veered just as often in the 
direction of San Diego tourist opportunities. Moyers repeatedly asked guests to 
steer him to La Jolla's best practitioner of California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Both Atkinson and his wife, Rita, spent much of the evening in the receiving 
line, the post they regularly occupy at official functions given at their 
residence. Asked how she liked having more than 100 guests in her home nibbling 
sushi and turkey won-tons, Rita Atkinson shrugged and said, "Oh, I'm used to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to press secretaries -- the list included George Christian, Ronald 
Ziegler and Jerald terHorst -- the guest list also included a few who had 
served under them, including Margita White, who worked for the Nixon and Ford 
administrations. She arrived with close pal Gloria Penner of KPBS, who 
described the symposium as another indication of San Diego's increasing 
prominence in national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are those who believe that, next to the President himself, the most 
powerful person in government is his press secretary, and I'm inclined to 
agree," Penner said. "To have almost every one of the press secretaries 
together here in San Diego positions us, once again, as a national power base." 
</P>
<P>
KPBS Community Advisory Board Chairman Viviane Warren saw the symposium as 
benefiting the city, but she also thought it might aid in expanding important 
minds that are constantly subject to Washington's peculiar myopia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like bringing the Beltway here, like transplanting a little of 
Washington's charismatic 'oomph' to San Diego," she said. "But it's also good 
for the press secretaries. They've never been all together outside the Beltway, 
and their meeting in San Diego gives them a fresh perspective for their 
exchange of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Whether exchanging ideas or simply the addresses of La Jolla eateries, the 
press secretaries seemed to have a good time at the Atkinsons', as did the 
local guests, among them KPBS Executive Director Paul Steen; UCSD Associate 
Vice Chancellor Mary Lindenstein Walshok; Richard and Harriet Levi; Hugh and 
Pat Carter; Paul Marshall and Darlene Davies; Donald and Darlene Shiley; Art 
and Jeannie Rivkin; William and Anne Otterson; Harry and Susan Summers, and 
Marianne McDonald with Adrian Jaffer. 
</P>
<P>
The 33 young women who will be presented at the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority's 
35th annual debutante tea and orientation Sunday learned, among other things, 
that they will be expected to wear floor-length white gowns with modest sleeves 
and billowing hoop skirts. The importance of the hoop skirts was repeatedly 
stressed to the debs, who met at the UC San Diego International Center and who, 
on the whole, seemed to take the information with youthful equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
The sorority's local Epsilon Xi Omega chapter expects an attendance of at least 
900 at "Through the Years, a Vision Fair," to be given March 31 at the San 
Diego Marriott. Proceeds from the event will fund scholarships to be awarded to 
10 to 12 college-bound seniors at San Diego high schools, and will also fund 
such chapter projects as Neighborhood House, the Urban League and the United 
Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The sorority also assists several Headstart programs in the county. "We think 
we're doing some real dynamite things," said chapter spokeswoman Cheeneah 
Armstrong, who added that in addition to attending parties and charm classes, 
the debs will be expected to engage in community service projects, such as 
assembling Easter baskets for homeless children and working in literacy 
programs. "The girls often will get together to choose, as a group, the service 
they wish to perform," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter President Marsha Jamison said that more motives than might be readily 
apparent fuel her group's enthusiasm for the annual debutante ball, which ranks 
as one of the city's longer-running events. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main focus for the girls is leadership enhancement, which is why they go 
through both cultural and volunteer experiences," Jamison said. "All of these 
are designed to make the debs self-assured and confident by the end of the 
season. The proceeds go back to the community, and several years ago, we were 
the first organization to receive the San Diego Black Achievement Award, which 
always had gone to an individual." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the newly minted debutantes expressed both excitement and a bit of 
apprehension about their impending bows.

COLLEGE TO OFFER DRUG AND ALCOHOL REHABILITATION IN THE CLASSROOM; 
</P>
<P>
INNOVATION: A COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR SEES THE CLASS AS A WAY TO REACH 
THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD STANDARD TREATMENT PROGRAMS. EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ARE 
SKEPTICAL. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles Mission College, a small community college in San Fernando, has 
attracted both curiosity and skepticism with the announcement that it will 
offer an outpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation program in the guise of a 
one-semester class. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mission College administrators, students can use the revolutionary 
course to fight their drug or alcohol problems and earn three units of college 
credit at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
James Crossen, the course's instructor, said the class was developed in the 
hope of reaching community residents who otherwise might not seek treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people who live in the Pacoima and Sylmar areas can't afford expensive 
hospital or outpatient programs, but they still need help," said Crossen, who 
formerly spent seven years as program director for the Chemical Dependency 
Recovery Center at AMI Medical Center of North Hollywood. "We think this course 
will compare in many ways to an outpatient program but hopefully be an 
affordable alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Feb. 9, the class will meet each Friday afternoon at the Clara 
Pledger Counseling Center in Pacoima, where students will receive education 
about alcoholism, an introduction to the 12-step program of Alcoholics 
Anonymous and encouragement from other recovering alcoholics and addicts. 
</P>
<P>
The course costs $15 and is also open to family members and friends who want 
help in dealing with the effects of alcoholism. It is being offered as part of 
Mission College's Chemical Dependency Studies Program, which was founded by 
Crossen and trains students to work as drug rehabilitation counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Several professionals in the field of alcoholism treatment said that, in 
concept, the idea for a recovery class is a good one. Nevertheless, they voiced 
skepticism about its chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lloyd Hyndman, medical director of the Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency 
Service at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, said he respects Crossen 
professionally "and I think he really wants to find a method to help people who 
can't afford other programs. But I don't know whether this is going to work. . 
. . We know from experience that people don't get sober and stay sober because 
of intellectual learning. There also has to be a complete change of attitude 
and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kenny, substance-abuse program director for the Motion Picture &amp; 
Television Fund in Los Angeles, said he doubts whether a college course will 
attract people from the community who need help. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be similarities between this class and an outpatient program, but 
there's also a big difference," Kenny said. "People usually get into an 
outpatient program because of intervention by an employer, a spouse or after 
they've been through an inpatient program. When you consider the fact that 
alcoholism is a disease of denial, it makes you wonder how many people are 
going to sign up just because they read about it in a class schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Although the course is formally listed in Mission College's class schedule as 
"Chemical Dependency III," Crossen was quick to point out that passing Chemical 
Dependency I and II -- which are purely academic courses -- is not a 
prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just how the course got listed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flyers about the class describe it as "a treatment and recovery program for 
individual alcoholics and drug addicts of whatever kind." In addition to 
presenting educational information, Crossen said there also will be group 
therapy sessions and presentations on job hunting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Programs on alcohol education and drug-abuse prevention aren't new for 
community colleges. But offering classes on recovery from alcoholism very well 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, legislation was passed that enables colleges to receive federal 
funding for implementing alcohol and drug education programs, according to 
Carole Richard, a spokeswoman with the California Community College 
Chancellor's Office in Sacramento. Although two community colleges and six 
universities in California receive funding for such programs, she said, no 
specifics are currently available to determine whether any institution other 
than Mission College is offering credit courses on recovery. None of the eight 
colleges that receive federal funding report offering a class on recovery. The 
Mission College course receives no government funding. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does it seem likely that a proliferation of such courses will take place in 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, one of the two community colleges 
receiving federal money for its alcohol education program, reported that there 
is no plan to follow Mission College's into the realm of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think it's stretching things a bit ethically to offer a course 
like that for credit," said Thom Thomas, adviser with the Saddleback's Alcohol 
and Drug Certificate Program. "Also, there's the whole question of insurance. 
Once you say that you are offering treatment, you open the college up to the 
whole issue of liability." 
</P>
<P>
Crossen, however, dismissed the idea of liability as bureaucratic paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is treatment, and it's all a lot of semantic nonsense," he said. 
"When it comes down to it, that's all recovery can be -- education about the 
disease, about yourself, and learning what steps you need to take to stop 
drinking or using drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Community College District officials, who last November reviewed 
Mission College's request to offer the course, apparently shared that view. 
</P>
<P>
According to District spokeswoman Irene Pinkard, Crossen and some of the 400 
students involved in the college's chemical dependency studies program -- many 
of whom themselves are recovering alcoholics -- made an impassioned plea to be 
permitted to offer the class. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked about their own recovery, and how important it was for them to 
reach out to others. It was a very emotional presentation and very moving," 
Pinkard said. "Colleges certainly have a role now in addressing the problem of 
alcoholism and addiction, and this seemed like a way for us to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Like Pinkard, Crossen shrugged at the suggestion that the unorthodox class 
could clear the way for other colleges to become involved in the area of 
alcoholism recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to blaze new trails by offering this course. We just wanted 
to help people who need it," Crossen said. "If it turns out later that we have 
blazed a new trail," he said, "so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Registration for the course begins Jan. 22, but students also can register the 
first night of class. For more information, call (818) 897-7731 or (818) 
994-6858.

<P>
BIRDS OF AN EXOTIC FEATHER NEED UNDERSTANDING, MANNERS

Benay Karp's two guests from Guyana clearly weren't happy about being in her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Perched in the corner of an empty room, both visitors hissed menacingly when 
she looked at them and let out bloodcurdling screams when she stepped in their 
direction. But Karp, obviously accustomed to such rude behavior, was not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Just give me a few days with them and you won't even know them," she said, 
turning her back to her shrieking house guests. "In no time, they'll be a joy 
to have around." 
</P>
<P>
Her optimism was based on experience. As owner of Tame Exotic Birds, an 
8-year-old business she runs out of her North Hollywood home, Karp has 
transformed hundreds of wild and ill-mannered exotic birds into pets their 
owners can be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by as many as 20 cockatoos, macaws and exotic parrots (all in cages) 
at one time, the 27-year-old animal trainer works with the birds several times 
a day -- talking to them, handling them or gently squirting them with water if 
they try to bite -- until she has won their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Exotic birds are starting to take on dogs and cats in terms of popularity, but 
there's not a lot of information," Karp said. "People plunk down hundreds or 
thousands of dollars and then assume that if they can train a dog to sit, they 
can tame a wild bird. But after awhile, the bird gets too obnoxious to have in 
their home and they can't stand it anymore. That's when they either sell it or 
start looking for help." 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Rosen of La Canada Flintridge, who bought a yellow collar macaw last 
year for $600 -- a sum considered inexpensive by many, since some exotic birds 
can cost as much as $20,000 -- considered doing the former. "He was very 
high-strung and nervous when I got him, but I thought I could work with him. 
Instead, he actually got worse," Rosen said. "I finally made up my mind to sell 
him to a breeder because he was so awful." 
</P>
<P>
When a friend suggested she take the bird to Karp, Rosen's thoughts were 
somewhere between a wing and a prayer. Within a few days, though, the bird left 
his former personality far behind. "He's affectionate now, he walks right onto 
my arm, and he's fun to have around," Rosen said. "He's a completely different 
pet." 
</P>
<P>
For Stephen Kaplin of Woodland Hills, getting help for Kona, his $1,300 blue 
and gold macaw, was a medical necessity. "Every time I tried to take him out of 
the cage, he bit me severely," Kaplin said. "Macaws have beaks that are strong 
enough to break a broomstick. I had scars all over." 
</P>
<P>
Karp, Kaplin said, "was fearless from the start." When the bird tried to bite 
her, she gently squirted him with a water bottle. Within an hour, "Kona was 
going in and out of his cage and getting onto my arm." 
</P>
<P>
Karp isn't the only trainer of exotic birds in the Los Angeles area, but 
several veterinarians said they recommend her to bird owners. The price for her 
services? In most cases, she said, between $100 and $150. 
</P>
<P>
For birds that already have learned the fundamental social graces, Karp holds 
monthly classes on advanced bird etiquette. Up to 10 owners at a time are shown 
how to teach their pet to answer a play telephone, roller-skate or mimic an 
outstretched American eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous feathered pupils, some of which can sing "I Left My Heart in San 
Francisco," have watched their careers take flight in movies and on television. 
</P>
<P>
"He did one commercial and it was fun, but I don't want to be a stage mom," 
said Becky Berryhill of Glendale, whose Amazon gray parrot rolls over, waves 
one foot and gives kisses on request. "I'd just like him to learn new things," 
she added. "They make him more human." 
</P>
<P>
Although Karp prefers to focus on her success stories, she knows that there 
have been, well, mishaps. One elderly woman, she recalled, bought a cockatoo 
for several thousand dollars and then tried for months to teach it to talk. 
After she gave up, she brought the bird to Karp's home. 
</P>
<P>
Several nights later, Karp said, she was walking through her dark living room 
when she stubbed her toe. She yelled an unprintable word. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure enough, that was the one word the bird learned," she said, smiling 
somewhat sheepishly. "Needless to say, this little old lady wasn't very happy 
when she came to get him and that's how he greeted her." (There was no charge 
for the training.) 
</P>
<P>
How do exotic birds learn to talk? Often, Karp and owners say, it is a random 
selection of words and phrases they like the sound of. Several studies have 
found that the intelligence and temperament of many exotic bird species is 
comparable to a 3-year-old child's, said Dr. Robert Clipshan, a Simi Valley 
veterinarian. Many birds can have vocabularies of more than 300 words. 
</P>
<P>
"And, just like a 3-year-old, they sometimes say things they shouldn't," said 
Azi Cohen, manager of It's a Dog's Life, a pet store in Studio City that allows 
customers to finance exotic birds the way they would an expensive car. "One 
woman came into the store and one of our birds said, 'You'd be cute if you 
weren't so fat.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cohen didn't make a sale that day. 
</P>
<P>
Not all exotic birds are hostile or aggressive because they lack proper 
training. Some, pet store owners say, have been abused or mistreated in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
One pet store owner remembered a parrot that had been chased by children with a 
stick and then spray-painted green. Another pet store owner said a cockatoo, 
worth close to $3,000, had been plucked of its wing feathers by an ignorant 
owner who didn't want it to fly away. 
</P>
<P>
Other birds, breeders and pet store owners say, have been smuggled from Mexico, 
South America, Africa or Australia into the United States -- where a pair of 
some species, such as the endangered hyacinth macaw from Brazil, can bring as 
much as $60,000 on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt the 
smuggling of exotic birds, but the problem is still widespread. "Los Angeles is 
a major bird import center and a lot of wildlife gets through illegally," said 
Mike Osborn, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inspector. "It's a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
Of the about 200,000 exotic birds smuggled into the country each year, Osborn 
said, three out of four will die of disease or during transport. Each year, he 
added, about 800,000 exotic birds are imported legally into the United States. 
Two-thirds of them die before they arrive at a pet store. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had men drive up in a van and ask me if I wanted to buy some birds they 
had in the back, and it was obvious they had been smuggled," said Brenda 
Seymore, manager of Discount Bird Supply in Canoga Park. "If people buy a bird 
like that because they think they are getting a good price, there's no way of 
telling what they'll get." 
</P>
<P>
Exotic birds that have been legitimately bred always have an identifying 
unbroken band around one foot, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
But for owners who simply have ended up with an ill-mannered or wild bird that 
hasn't quite adjusted to culture shock, help is available. "Usually, you just 
have to convince them that you don't want to eat them," Karp said. "They're 
just scared." 
</P>
<P>
Karp, who owns a second house in Northridge that is inhabited by 180 exotic 
birds she breeds and sells, didn't set out to be a bird trainer. Instead, she 
said, it began as a lark. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in Long Island, Karp said, she had several pets, 
including a ferret, a raccoon and rabbits. Each one, she said, did tricks that 
other people thought were unusual. "I didn't know that most rabbits don't 
fetch. Mine did." 
</P>
<P>
When a friend's mother saw how well-trained her pets were, she asked if Karp 
would work with her cockatoo. Shortly afterward, Karp went to work in a 
federally regulated quarantine station, where imported exotic birds are kept 
for 30 days before they can be sold. Eight years ago, after moving to 
California, she decided to start a bird-training business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very lucky, because I get to do what I love," Karp said, listening to the 
cacophony of birds, all trying to be center stage by singing "God Bless 
America" or holding their wings outstretched while yelling "Look at me, I'm an 
eagle." 
</P>
<P>
Karp sighed. "I really hate Fridays."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PADRES PITCHER FINDS GUITAR PICK A 
PLEASING ALTERNATIVE 
</P>

San Diego Padres pitcher Eric Show is into his off-season incarnation as a jazz 
guitarist. This Sunday night at the Salmon House in Quivira Basin, between 
Mission Beach and Ocean Beach, Show and top local saxophonist Gary Lefebvre 
will front a rhythm section of Barry Farrar on drums, Bob Hamilton on piano and 
Tom Azarello on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Show has played with Lefebvre on several occasions. The musicians first heard 
each other at one of jazzman Bob Oakes' Sunday jam sessions in Ocean Beach and 
felt a musical rapport. They recorded an album of Christmas songs and planned 
to release it last year, but Show decided to wait until he could arrange more 
thorough distribution than he had for his last album, "America . . . 4/4 To 
Go." 
</P>
<P>
While not on a level with the Wes Montgomerys and Joe Passes of the world, Show 
is a respected guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
"He can play," Lefebvre said. "He can burn on a lot of the old standards and 
some of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre, who worked with the late trumpeter Chet Baker in the '60s, has put 
his career into overdrive after moving back to San Diego from Ventura 2 1/2 
years ago. He backed Mose Allison during the singer's recent dates at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blues gig," Lefebvre said. "He's got some things with different kinds 
of changes and he makes you think differently, but I started missing the good 
jazz standards." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre will also be working with legendary bop trumpeter Red Rodney next 
month at Elario's. And he plans to get his own big band back into rehearsals 
and regular live dates. 
</P>
<P>
At the Salmon House, Show and Lefebvre will play from 6-10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's hip to merge African, Cuban or South American rhythms with jazz or pop 
these days, but percussionist Gene Perry is no fashion follower. Perry moved to 
San Diego from Puerto Rico in 1968, and has led his own rhythm-based ensembles 
here since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who makes a living as a groundskeeper at San Diego State University, 
formed Afro Rumba in 1983. This Saturday at 8 p.m., the nine-piece group makes 
a rare appearance at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the band played mostly variations on Afro-Cuban rhythms, but when 
Perry noticed his diverse audiences included a large number of Latinos, he 
began adding ample doses of salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Live shows bounce to a variety of beats; the band's repertoire includes several 
Latin standards by big-name players like Eddie Palmieri and Mongo Santamaria, 
along with a number of original tunes, many penned by the band's former 
saxophonist Esteban Favila. Perry fuels the fire with a mixed attack on congas, 
bongos, timbales, tamboura and an assortment of other percussion instruments. 
He uses his voice as an additional rhythm instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Perry could increase his following by broadening the music, but he refuses to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Most clubs want Top 40. We don't do that," he said. "Some of the Latinos like 
more of the straight-ahead salsa rhythms, for dancing. It's kind of hard, since 
I'm mixing them up with Latin jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Perry described salsa, generally speaking, as relentless rhythmic dance music, 
while the Latin, or Afro-Cuban, numbers are more expressive, with melodies more 
prominently featured and with more room for improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
Perry has been busy. A few months ago, he sat in with percussionist Tito Puente 
in Tijuana. Recently, he studied with master percussionist Angel (Cachete) 
Maldonado in Puerto Rico, working on traditional rhythms, refining his 
technique on congas. 
</P>
<P>
Perry will open the Saturday show with two hours of African-influenced music 
from Puerto Rico and Cuba. Joined by three dancers, he'll demonstrate bomba, 
rumba and plena rhythms. Then from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., Afro Rumba will perform 
Latin jazz and salsa. Dancing shoes are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Former Big Band singer Ann Williams has been booking the jazz at the tiny Beach 
House restaurant in Mission Beach since last summer. Williams, whose best-known 
music was made in the late '40s with Tex Beneke's Big Band, is also an 
influential member of the board of the San Diego Jazz Society. Since joining a 
few months ago, she has attracted such local jazz luminaries as James Moody, 
Charles McPherson and Jim Merod to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Now Williams, who occasionally sings a song or two at Elario's when her jazz 
friends are on stage, is thinking of singing more often. She may do a night or 
two at the restaurant, perhaps with a guitarist or pianist. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she's bringing top talent to the Beach House. Jan. 19 and 26, 
Mike Wofford plays solo piano; Thursdays, its Dan Papaila on guitar; Saturday 
nights, Brazilian pianist Elfredo Cardim does Gilberto, Jobim and other south 
American classics. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The San Diego Jazz Society has announced its first show of the new year: 
saxophonist Marshal Royal and trumpeter Joseph Wilder at the Lyceum Stage 
theater in Horton Plaza on Jan. 27. . . . Next Wednesday, Fattburger plays the 
Catamaran Resort Hotel's "Jazz Trax Nite," hosted by Art Good. . . . An 
interview with Max Roach will be featured on the KSDS-FM (88.3) "Percussive 
Profiles" program at 3 p.m. Monday. . . . At the Horton Grand Hotel's Palace 
Bar: Friday, pianist Mel Goot, happy hour, followed by the Bill Hunter Duo; 
Saturday: Jack Hennessey, happy hour, followed by Hunter.

SUPERVISORS REBUFF CSU OVER TAYLOR RANCH SITE; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPUSES: THE BOARD MAJORITY REACTS ANGRILY TO A TAYLOR RANCH-OR-NOTHING 
ULTIMATUM BY CSU CHANCELLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a political rebuff to Cal State University Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week pointedly declined to support 
construction of a new state university at the controversial Taylor Ranch site 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors endorsed establishment of a new four-year Cal State campus in 
Ventura County but ignored an ultimatum delivered by Reynolds last month, which 
stated that no Cal State campus will be built in the county except at Taylor 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, board chairwoman, called the chancellor's 
ultimatum a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that anyone in education would make that kind of a 
shoot-from-the-hip statement," she said. "I'm going to give her a chance to 
rethink her position." 
</P>
<P>
The vote by the supervisors occurred as the Taylor Ranch site debate heated up 
dramatically in the wake of the ultimatum by Reynolds, who also asked for a 
public show of support for her position. 
</P>
<P>
While supporters of the Taylor Ranch site rallied to Cal State's cause, critics 
launched their own last-minute campaign to have a Cal State campus located 
elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
During the supervisors' debate preceding Tuesday's vote, Supervisor John K. 
Flynn argued unsuccessfully for written support of a university at Taylor Ranch 
on the condition that no "fatal flaws" emerge in a broadened environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sending the wrong message here," Flynn said. "We risk not getting 
anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
In a move toward compromise, Supervisor Maggie Erickson added a brief statement 
to the letter to the CSU trustees, acknowledging the "state's right to choose a 
site." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, however, did not acknowledge Reynolds' Taylor 
Ranch-or-nothing position. Lacey, who drafted the letter the board will send, 
said she wants to see the expanded environmental impact report before she 
decides whether to endorse the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we will be able to discuss it with the facts on the table," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In delivering her ultimatum to the county late last month, Reynolds said the 
state had spent four years searching for a site and had looked at 40 locations. 
She requested a public show of support for the Taylor Ranch location by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Without that support, in the form of letters to trustees and public officials 
as well as proclamations by public bodies, Reynolds said, the state will scrap 
plans to conduct a full environmental impact report at Taylor Ranch and will 
take its resources to counties that would welcome the university. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded environmental report became necessary after a Ventura Superior 
Court judge in November found that an earlier report based on a two-year campus 
was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors' action was the strongest sign this week that at least 
some local officials have decided to dismiss the ultimatum or to view it as an 
ill-advised ploy to force support. 
</P>
<P>
But Reynolds said she stands firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of reconsidering," Reynolds said Tuesday. "We again went 
through many of the other proposed sites. There were problems because it was 
agricultural land or it was near an airport or it had multiple owners. 
</P>
<P>
"We've advertised for this twice now and have looked at nearly 40 sites." 
</P>
<P>
CSU Trustee Theodore J. Saenger said Tuesday that the chancellor has the full 
support of the board. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the chief administrative officer and that is the CSU position," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Saenger nor Reynolds would comment on whether the supervisors' letter 
constitutes the kind of endorsement they want. 
</P>
<P>
The draft reads: 
</P>
<P>
"The Ventura County Board of Supervisors fully supports the critical need for a 
public university in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the state's right to choose a site, that any site considered for 
such a public university be subject, as required by law, to a complete detailed 
environmental report so that all environmental and economic aspects can be 
fully considered and discussed; 
</P>
<P>
"That the state not turn its back on Ventura County's education needs by 
imposing arbitrary deadlines on the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
The board's letter was praised by Taylor Ranch opponents and was greeted with 
some expressions of disappointment from supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the board's endorsement because we strongly support a university in 
the county, but we strongly oppose one at Taylor Ranch," said Mike Harrelson, a 
spokesman for Patagonia Inc., whose founder, Yvon Chouinard, has been an 
outspoken opponent of the proposed Taylor Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gregorchuck, president of the Ventura Chamber of Commerce, called the 
action disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were glad the board was unanimous in support for a university in the 
county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a university is the single point of agreement on both sides of the 
highly charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 students commute to Cal State Northridge from Ventura County, 
according to state statistics. No figures were available from UC Santa Barbara 
on how many students make the northbound commute from Ventura County. But both 
campuses are facing enrollment caps that threaten their ability to serve 
Ventura County students. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge closed enrollment to new freshmen and sophomores for 
spring, 1990, and UC Santa Barbara plans to allow only an additional 1,000 
students over its current 19,000 for the next 15 years, UCSB Chancellor Barbara 
Uehling said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California is now in the early stages of selecting sites for 
three proposed campuses, one in northern, one in central and one in Southern 
California. Although the president's office would not disclose any specifics 
about the 150 locations being considered, spokesman Rick Malaspina said "no 
county has been eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Because the UC system has different admission standards and does not serve the 
same student population, the prospect of a new Cal State campus in Ventura 
County would not deter UC from building in the county, Malaspina said. However, 
negative reaction in the community to the Cal State campus could affect any 
decision by UC to put a campus in the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Komers, Ventura County director of personnel, said he believes both 
universities are needed to train people in fields ranging from nursing to civil 
engineers. The county has 6,400 employees and more than 800 vacancies, many 
that have lacked for qualified applicants for years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because our cost of housing is so high here in Ventura County, we need to take 
the county population that already lives here with roots here and develop them 
to meet our needs locally rather than trying to import talent from elsewhere," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge has 1,000 students and 1,300 more on 
a waiting list, CSUN Director Joyce Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents of Ventura County have been paying for public higher education 
beyond the community college level and they are not receiving their fair share 
of state resources generated by the county," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly eight of 10 students at Cal State's Ventura 
extension campus are women; eight of 10 are working people. With an average age 
of 34, many students are women who are re-entering the school and job markets, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a university would help serve the county's growing Hispanic 
population, Kennedy said, many of whom come from lower income families and 
cannot afford to send their children to college out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura City Councilwoman Cathy Bean, who ran and was elected on her opposition 
to the Taylor Ranch, said the need here is "not that desperate." 
</P>
<P>
"As for lower-income students, we know we are talking about the Hispanic 
students, and our big concern with them is to make sure they get out of high 
school being able to read and write, and then getting into college for a couple 
of years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Graciela Soliz, a teacher in the Oxnard School District and vice president of 
the Oxnard chapter of the Assn. of Mexican-American Educators, said Hispanic 
students need and would use a four-year college as much or more as any other 
ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"All students, of all colors and races, need a four-year college," Soliz said. 
</P>
<P>
She called Bean's statement racist. "I'm surprised an educated person would 
even utter such words," Soliz said.

HOMELAND: CONCERT PIANIST SOFIA COSMA LEFT SOVIET PRISON CAMPS ALMOST 40 YEARS 
AGO. MONDAY, SHE WILL RETURN TO THE SOVIET UNION TO PERFORM AT MOSCOW'S 
TCHAIKOVSKY HALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia Cosma was thrown into a Soviet prison camp at the start of World War II 
and spent the next seven years battling starvation. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, who had studied to be a classical pianist, was put to work at 
hard labor weeding carrots and potatoes and making charcoal briquettes. 
</P>
<P>
After her release, Cosma found her way to Romania, discovering that life in 
that country also consigned her to an existence of hardship. 
</P>
<P>
She won stardom as the piano soloist with the Romanian Philharmonic. But that 
did not put an end to sharing a cramped four-bedroom apartment with another 
family or waiting in long lines for scraps of meat to feed her children. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Cosma finally fled the communist world. Today she lives in Camarillo, 
ensconced in a spacious house -- complete with two glossy black grand pianos -- 
that her daughter Ilona Scott had built after their defection. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to the United States, she has lived a quiet life with Ilona and 
Toby Scott. She gives piano lessons to about 20 students and occasionally 
performs in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the 75-year-old pianist is embarking on a triumphant journey back 
into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades after her release from the prison camps of Siberia, Cosma is 
returning to the Soviet Union, where she has been invited to give a solo 
performance at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Hall on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cosma's daughter will return to Romania. There, the new 
government will allow Scott and her husband to bring home their 4-year-old 
adoptive daughter, Jessica, whom they have been struggling to bring to the 
United States for three years. 
</P>
<P>
The two homecomings will be chronicled in a movie documentary on Cosma, whom 
film producer Lisa Sonne describes as "an icon who captures the travails and 
triumphs of our century." 
</P>
<P>
"This is great to play with the Moscow Philharmonic," Cosma said last week, 
visibly excited, as she sat in her Camarillo home and talked about her life. 
</P>
<P>
Cosma was born in Latvia in pre-communist Russia. Her family later moved to 
Moscow, where she and other city children marched in Lenin's funeral parade. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, her childhood passed uneventfully. Her family returned to Latvia, 
where the young girl began to study piano. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was 18, Cosma knew that her life would center on music. The 
talented pianist moved to Austria and, as did many emigre musicians, changed 
her citizenship to Austrian. 
</P>
<P>
However, the young Jewish woman grew fearful of Austria's changing politics 
and, in 1938, returned to her family in Latvia, seeking refuge from the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Cosma's Austrian passport marked her as a traitor to the Soviet 
Union, and she was arrested in 1941 on the day war was declared on Nazi 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
She spent the next seven years in Russian prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hard, an extremely hard, life," Cosma said. 
</P>
<P>
Not a day passed that she did not long to touch a keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that I never will play more," she said last week. "I felt I am dead 
for music." 
</P>
<P>
But with characteristic optimism and resourcefulness, Cosma made a life for 
herself inside the camp. She married another prisoner and gave birth to Ilona, 
for whom she hoarded scraps of woolen thread taken from other prisoners' 
underwear to crochet a dress. 
</P>
<P>
Cosma and her daughter were released from the camp in 1948. Because of her 
citizenship, Cosma was returned to Austria. Her husband was placed six months 
later in his native Romania. She joined him in 1950 after a two-year campaign 
to get him out of Romania failed. 
</P>
<P>
There, the family, which soon included a son, shared a four-room apartment with 
another family. Cosma spent her time cleaning the quarters, caring for her 
children and waiting for groceries in endless lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard life to stand in lines to get a piece of meat or sometimes a 
piece of butter," Cosma said. "It was a battle for life, a hard battle." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the conditions, Cosma made sure her children were happy. And Cosma's 
life improved when she found a piano. A family, fleeing the country, sold it to 
her for what then served as hard currency -- a watch, a coat and Austrian 
chocolate bars. 
</P>
<P>
Friends ultimately persuaded her to audition as a permanent soloist with the 
Romanian Philharmonic, and she embarked on her career, performing on stage, 
radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
For three years after she returned to performing, the muscles in her arms 
ached, throbbing from wrist to shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The muscles had atrophied during the 15 years she was prohibited from 
practicing, first by internment in Russian prison camps and later by economic 
hardships in dictator-run Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted only to play well, but it was hard for me," she recalled last week. 
"My muscles were sore for three years. After every concert, I was tired." 
</P>
<P>
Tours took her to Italy, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, 
Yugoslavia and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"So I began to get a better life, but I had no freedom," Cosma said. "I had no 
big pleasure of life." 
</P>
<P>
After her daughter emigrated to the United States in 1973, Cosma made several 
trips to visit her. However, she did not feel free to defect until after her 
husband died and her son, Mihail, told her he also planned to leave. He did so 
in 1982 and now lives in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Today, when Cosma sits down at the piano, even if it is just to tickle the 
ivories for visitors, she assumes an unmistakable mantle of artistic power. 
</P>
<P>
"She's strong," said Karine Beesley, executive director of the Ventura County 
Symphony, which has featured Cosma in guest appearances. "She can really get a 
song out of the piano." 
</P>
<P>
Cosma continues to practice three to four hours a day, refusing to give in to 
back pain in her quest to maintain the skill and force that mark her 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
But sitting in the oversized living room, with the twin pianos covered with 
mementos from her European performances, Cosma seemed less an icon or 
world-renowned artist than a favorite aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Shyly reluctant to pose for pictures, Cosma worried about how her wispy brown 
hair would look for her performance in Moscow, then laughed amiably when her 
daughter said there is no hope. 
</P>
<P>
Cosma said she is eager to sightsee in the Soviet Union and to visit with 
relatives she has not seen for more than 15 years. But she is not homesick for 
her native land. Nor does she plan to return to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
After years of struggling, she is free. 
</P>
<P>
"This is freedom, what is here," she said. "It's enough."

WRIGHT'S FOE TOLD TO HALT ATTACKS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THREE GOP ASSEMBLY LEADERS SAY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY CANDIDATE'S TACTICS 
ARE HURTING HIMSELF AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In a move that upset some Republicans, three Assembly GOP leaders have 
intervened in the quickening race between Assemblywoman Cathie Wright and 
Republican challenger Hunt Braly, warning him to stop attacking Wright's 
integrity and party loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Braly, chief aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) was rebuked in unusually 
sharp terms in a Jan. 8 letter signed by Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson, 
Republican Caucus Chairman Bob Frazee and GOP Campaign and Elections Chairman 
Paul Woodruff. 
</P>
<P>
"Your continued use of unfounded inflammatory statements not only jeopardizes 
your candidacy but damages our Republican Party," said the letter, released 
Monday by Johnson. "We can only warn you that if you persist, we and other 
conscientious Republicans will do everything in our power to set the record 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
Braly is the most serious challenger that Wright, of Simi Valley, has faced 
since she was first elected in 1980 to represent the 37th Assembly District, a 
sprawling area that stretches over three counties from Agoura Hills to Lompoc. 
Their June election face-off is expected to be one of only a handful of 
seriously contested Republican primaries in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson upbraided Braly for his "opportunistic challenge of a dedicated, highly 
productive Republican incumbent" and his use of "questionable tactics to gain 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson specifically criticized Braly for telling a Santa Barbara newspaper 
that Wright has an "amicable relationship" with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) and voted with him "on a number of key issues." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Cathie Wright is one of the most loyal Republicans in the 
Assembly," the letter said. "She consistently votes with the Republican 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Braly could not be reached for comment. But some local Republicans said the 
letter was a heavy-handed tactic that shows how seriously party leaders take 
Braly's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's offensive. I think it's a threat letter," said one GOP political 
aide who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want my opinion, this would be a major boost for Hunt," continued the 
aide. "He'll be able to use this and run with it. It shows what he's up against 
-- insider politics, back-room politics and backslapper politics. And people 
are really sick of that." 
</P>
<P>
A local GOP assemblyman, who also demanded anonymity, said the letter 
represents an effort by Johnson -- the target of an ongoing effort within the 
Assembly GOP caucus to dump him as leader -- to hold onto the vote of Wright, a 
past supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Braly has repeatedly questioned Wright's well-publicized efforts to intercede 
with local police and judges on behalf of her daughter Victoria, who faced 
being jailed or losing her driver's license after accumulating 28 traffic 
tickets over several years. 
</P>
<P>
He also has questioned Wright's party loyalty by pointing to Brown's efforts to 
help her with Victoria Wright's problems. In addition to recommending a lawyer, 
Brown telephoned a Ventura County judge to ask for leniency for Victoria 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Wright previously drew party fire in 1988 after she sat out a Republican-backed 
vote to replace Brown as speaker with Assemblyman Charles Calderon 
(D-Alhambra). Her neutrality was viewed by some as tacit support of Brown, but 
she replied she was keeping a promise never to vote for a Democrat for speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Monday she was "very pleased" with Johnson's letter, saying he 
wrote it on his own initiative after seeing the Santa Barbara newspaper 
article. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she is on cordial personal terms with Brown, she has 
consistently voted against his Assembly positions. Wright added that she 
contributed $250,000 of her own campaign funds last year to other GOP 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"If that isn't party loyalty, I'll quit," she said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPERTY OWNERS FACE CRACKDOWN ON GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Simi Valley has adopted an ordinance requiring private property 
owners to promptly remove graffiti or allow city employees to do it at the 
property owner's expense. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which officials said is aimed at curbing gang activity as well as 
vandalism, will require private property owners to cover graffiti within 10 
days of official notification by the city. If they do not comply, city workers 
will do it and charge them for the labor. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also bans the sale of spray paint to minors and makes it illegal 
for juveniles to possess spray paint except under the supervision of an adult. 
The measure passed unanimously Monday without debate.

JURY CONVICTS HUSTLER CARTOONIST OF MOLESTING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cartoonist who created the Hustler magazine feature "Chester the Molester" 
was convicted last week of five counts of child molesting by a Ventura Superior 
Court jury that deliberated for five days. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of seven men and five women acquitted the cartoonist of six other 
charges, including incest and oral copulation, and deadlocked on another five 
counts of similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The cartoonist, Dwaine Tinsley, is scheduled to be sentenced March 1 by Judge 
Lawrence Storch. He faces up to 16 years in state prison and a $50,000 fine, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy hailed the verdict as vindication for the victim, now a 19-year-old 
waitress in Los Angeles, who he said had endured adults' disbelief almost all 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing here is that the jurors did believe her," Hardy said. 
Tinsley, who was arrested May 18 at his home in Simi Valley, was accused of 
sexually abusing the woman between 1984 and 1988, when she was between 13 and 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Tinsley's "Chester the Molester" cartoons for several years dealt satirically 
with child molestation, but pedophilia was eliminated from them several years 
ago, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't write this stuff all the time if you don't experience it," Tinsley 
reportedly told co-workers, according to evidence presented during seven days 
of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest and the ensuing publicity, Tinsley, 44, moved to Los Angeles, 
said his attorney, George C. Eskin. He will remain free in lieu of $50,000 bail 
until his sentencing, Eskin and Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Eskin said Tinsley is innocent and will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He characterized Tinsley's accuser as a recovering cocaine addict with a 
history of "emotional and sexual excesses." The woman made her accusations, he 
said, in retaliation for Tinsley's attempts to free her of drugs.

WRIGHT TO SEEK STATE HEALTH STUDY OF LAB WORKERS, NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BILL WOULD FUND FULL-SCALE INQUIRY INTO EFFECTS OF WORKING WITH 
TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS AT ROCKWELL'S SANTA SUSANA LABORATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) saysshe will introduce legislation 
to require a state health study of workers and neighbors of Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
State health epidemiologists, responding to requests from area lawmakers and 
concerned residents, recently began a feasibility study to determine if such an 
investigation is warranted. But they said limited funds and competing research 
requests might prevent a full-scale study of the field lab west of Chatsworth, 
where Rockwell employees have worked for years with toxic and radioactive 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is "the vehicle whereby the study would have to be done and it would 
also be funded by a special appropriation," said Michael Murphy, an aide to 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said the bill will be introduced within two weeks as an "urgency 
measure" that would take effect when it is signed by the governor, instead of 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, regional water quality officials, responding to an 
inquiry from state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), said they have "acted with 
dispatch" to clean up chemically tainted ground water at the 2,668-acre test 
site in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Jan. 5 letter from Robert P. Ghirelli, executive officer for the 
Los Angeles office of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, did 
not say why cleanup in the nuclear area at the field lab is years behind 
cleanup elsewhere on the site -- which is apparently what triggered Torres' 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
A Torres aide said Tuesday that the lawmaker would have no comment until "we . 
. . further study the response." 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Torres, who chairs the Senate toxics committee, responded to 
questions he posed last month about the board's performance in solving the 
ground water problems. His inquiry followed release of new data showing that 
solvent-contaminated ground water in the area of the lab, which has been 
devoted to nuclear research for the U.S. Department of Energy, is flowing 
toward the property line and may have seeped off-site. 
</P>
<P>
There are no drinking-water wells in the immediate area, and officials say the 
situation poses no direct threat to health. The main contaminant is 
trichloroethylene, or TCE, a cleaning compound that may raise the risk of 
cancer to those chronically exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is treating about 500,000 gallons per day of TCE-laced ground water in 
areas of Santa Susana devoted to rocket testing for NASA and the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
However, no similar cleanup is under way in the Energy Department area of the 
site, where Rockwell only recently installed a new series of monitoring wells 
to better determine the extent of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the board's supervision, Rockwell began investigating ground water 
contamination in the rocket testing areas in 1984 and later installed cleanup 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 290 acres controlled by the Energy Department, detailed ground water 
testing for TCE was not undertaken until last summer, after disclosures of 
contamination there. 
</P>
<P>
Ghirelli noted that the state Department of Health Services, in May, 1988, took 
over from the water board as the "lead agency" supervising cleanup activities. 
But he did not say why less work had been done in the Energy Department areas. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the department have long complained of a double standard in which 
its operations often are years behind other industrial sites in complying with 
environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1986, Rockwell told the water board that it had found solvent pollution 
in the Energy Department area, but could not conduct further tests for fear of 
drawing radioactively contaminated water from the basement of a former reactor 
building into the surrounding ground water. Rockwell said it was awaiting funds 
from the Energy Department to decontaminate the building, and the water board 
did not pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The department has proposed spending $34.6 million over several years to clean 
up chemical and radioactive pollution, which appears to exist mainly at low 
levels. Rockwell also will investigate whether TCE-laced ground water has 
seeped beyond the area's boundary.

INNOVATION: A 'STEVE JOBS OF GARBAGE' COULD CLEAN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look around to the smog, the jagged Himalayas of solid waste and the hungry 
CFCs munching on the ozone layer and, all of a sudden, the phrase "a good 
environment for business" takes on a whole new meaning. The 1980s had 
entrepreneurs; the 1990s will have ecopreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental and ecology movements have long had their articulate and 
charismatic visionaries -- the Rachel Carsons, the Amory Lovinses, the Paul 
Ehrlichs, etc. What these movements have been missing, however, are visionaries 
with a feel for markets and technologies along with the ability to translate 
ecological ideals into economic realities. There's not yet a Steven P. Jobs or 
a H. Ross Perot of the environment -- an ecopreneur who can simultaneously 
excite both the media and the marketplace. But there will be. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be an ecological imperative now," says University of 
Pennsylvania Prof. Thomas P. Hughes, author of "American Genesis," a history of 
American technology and industry. "We first create an intellectual revolution 
and a values revolution -- and then we see a technological revolution. I think 
there are a great number of firms to be established and fortunes to be made 
here. There's an advocacy for the environment today that's similar to the ethic 
of mass production back in the 1920s." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, an ever-evolving web of government regulation is spinning an 
infrastructure that encourages ecopreneurial investment and innovation. 
Environmental quality standards create market opportunities even as they 
address ecological concerns. Nevertheless, these standards don't reflect a "no 
growth" mentality as much as they do an emerging consensus that we'd be smarter 
to help manage the environment than ignore it. Building those management tools 
and technologies represents a chance to build a new global industry. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why venture capital -- normally the source of seed funding 
for high-tech ventures such as genetic engineering and silicon chip design -- 
is beginning to spill into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"You go where the waste is," says Oliver Nicklin, managing partner of the 
Chicago-based Environmental Venture Fund, a 2-year-old, $40-million venture 
capital fund that Nicklin claims is the first focusing purely on ecopreneurial 
opportunities. "It's almost a bit of a perpetual growth industry." 
</P>
<P>
Where venture capitalists once thought ecopreneurialism a crazy idea, Nicklin 
reports that today he is invited to speak at industry functions, and some of 
the most prestigious names in venture capital now co-invest in his fund's 
deals. "Estimates are that this industry is anywhere from $40 billion of $60 
billion in size and growing," he says. "You can make a lot of money if you have 
even a small piece of that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is enormous potential in many areas of the environment," asserts Alan 
Lloyd, chief scientist of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
"People are now much more willing to invest and buy those products." 
</P>
<P>
Given the magnitude of Los Angeles' environmental problems, Southern California 
is a sure bet to emerge as a hotbed and testbed of ecopreneurial activity. 
Lloyd sees market opportunities in technologies ranging from fuel cells for 
power generation to new types of chemical coatings that are less 
environmentally hostile. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway smog, for example, is so corrosive that Lloyd anticipates an 
ecopreneurial niche in custom air filters to clean up the microatmospheres of 
California cars. "There should be a market for a filter to clean up air that's 
coming into your car," Lloyd says. "There are a lot of toxics in the air as 
people commute to work so if you spend a lot of time on the freeway, your 
exposure can be quite high." The AQMD is now sponsoring workshops to encourage 
the diffusion of ecology-flavored technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to look at new technologies," says William Ruckelshaus, the former 
Environmental Protection Agency director who's now chairman and chief executive 
of Browning-Ferris Industries, the $2.5-billion-a-year giant of the solid waste 
management industry. "We get interesting ideas almost daily." 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris recently launched a medical waste division that grew from "zero 
to a $100-million business in less than 24 months," says Ruckelshaus, who 
stresses that there are numerous opportunities for both market segmentation and 
technology application in the waste management field. He sees an increasing 
role for genetically engineered waste-gobbling microorganisms in the 
"bio-remediation" of waste products. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "If someone came up with a viable substitute for CFCs (the 
refrigerant chemical that has been linked to ozone depletion) that would be a 
huge market, and if acid rain legislation passes, that also creates enormous 
economic opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that genetic engineering technology has created a fundamental 
discontinuity in the agricultural and medical industries, this new Greening of 
America creates a fundamental discontinuity in public attitudes that makes a 
fast-growth ecopreneurial industry a genuine probability. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are established businesses such as Browning-Ferris and waste 
management, but with the shifts and swirls in attitudes, legislation and 
technologies -- not to mention the influx of risk capital -- today's status quo 
doesn't stand a chance. The Apple Computers, Genentechs and Federal Expresses 
of the environment are likely to be born in this decade; the children of 1960s 
Idealism and 1980s Greed. That's not a bad pedigree at all, especially if it 
helps us breathe easier. Trend isn't destiny -- but this time, we better hope 
it is.

CAMPEAU UNITS TO PAY BILLS BUT ARE STILL SHAKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Campeau Corp. passed an important financial test Wednesday, but its two 
troubled department store divisions came under mounting pressure to file a 
landmark bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores operations gave 
some comfort to the battered apparel industry and other retail suppliers when 
they announced that they were paying bills that had come due for roughly $100 
million in Christmas merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Acting to patch up its relations with the financial community, Campeau also 
appointed a well-respected Marriott Corp. executive, 47-year-old Chance 
Bahadur, to assume the duties of chief financial officer for its U.S. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves, however, were just "a little positive news for a very bad 
situation," said Barbara J. Wedelstaedt, an analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
To remain in business without going into bankruptcy, analysts said, the Campeau 
stores would have to assure suppliers and bankers that they can continue paying 
their bills. But at this point, the analysts said, Allied and Federated lack 
the financial strength to provide that assurance. Consequently, shipments are 
being halted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are bare spots showing up in their stores. Now you can see there are 
some problems going on," said Corky Newman, president of corporate marketing 
and licensing for Cherokee Group, a Sunland-based apparel maker. 
</P>
<P>
Many suppliers say they hope that Allied and Federated will go into Chapter 11 
because it would allow the department stores to get new financing to stay in 
business and stabilize their operations while working on a reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody just wants it settled," Newman said. "Do it. Get it over with. 
Everybody has dealt with Chapter 11 before." 
</P>
<P>
Added Michael Gould, president and chief executive of Giorgio Beverly Hills, 
which has supplied fragrances to Campeau stores: "Everyone is in a state of 
limbo. Once you know what's going on, you can ship again." 
</P>
<P>
Gould called a Chapter 11 filing for Allied and Federated "inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way out of this," Gould said. "It would be something near 
impossible for them to delay this." 
</P>
<P>
Apparel industry sources said buyers for Campeau stores who were in New York 
for this year's "market week," where apparel manufacturers meet with retailers, 
were called back to their stores for staff meetings early today. No details of 
what would be discussed were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers, however, saw hope in Wednesday's moves by Campeau for 
a last-ditch effort by Campeau officials to avert a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
"If in fact vendors were paid, it certainly sends a signal that some form of a 
plan is being worked out to prevent the company from going into bankruptcy," 
said Gilbert W. Harrison, chairman of Financo, a New York investment banking 
firm that specializes in the retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were going into bankruptcy, I wouldn't pay anybody," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Other retail industry sources suggested, however, that Allied and Federated 
made their latest payments to stay on good terms with important suppliers. If 
these suppliers turned against Allied and Federated, the stores would be even 
harder pressed to buy merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Although paying bills due this week was considered an important test for the 
Campeau stores, a more crucial deadline arrives Monday. A lending syndicate led 
by New York's Citibank has said it may call in $2.34 billion in loans on Monday 
if certain financial conditions are not met by Federated and Allied. With cash 
apparently running low for Federated and Allied, the divisions are expected to 
file for Chapter 11 protection by then if the banks do not grant another 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, analysts were encouraged by the appointment of Bahadur, who most 
recently was Marriott Corp.'s treasurer and a senior vice president. Before 
that, he was a vice president and treasurer of E-II Holdings Inc. and Beatrice 
Co. from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Wedelstaedt said Bahadur is considered a first-rate finance executive who will 
give the Campeau operations renewed credibility in dealing with its lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at market week in New York, the mood was unusually grim. Many 
Seventh Avenue designers, forced by their financial middlemen to halt their 
business with Allied and Federated, were anxiously awaiting word concerning the 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The joke among the manufacturers and retailers, Newman said, was that "the only 
difference between Seventh Avenue and the Titanic is that the Titanic had a 
piano." 
</P>
<P>
Although Toronto-based Campeau has the second-largest department store 
organization in the United States, there are no Allied or Federated outlets in 
Southern California. Its only retail business here is the Ralphs supermarkets 
chain, which is not expected to be included in any bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Over much of the country, however, Campeau is a major power in retailing with 
such prominent chains as Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Strauss, Burdines, 
Jordan Marsh and the Bon Marche.

AT&amp;T SUES MCI, CLAIMS TOP RIVAL IS STEALING CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph charged Wednesday that its leading 
competitor, MCI Communications, has been stealing AT&amp;T long-distance 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being hoodwinked," claimed Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T vice president 
for consumer services, in announcing the firm's filing of a deceptive-practices 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that MCI or its agent, Pioneer Teletechnologies, have used 
"false and misleading" direct-sales practices and, in some cases, signed up 
AT&amp;T customers without the customers' authorization. Separately, AT&amp;T 
asked the Federal Communications Commission to require that customers authorize 
in writing any changes of long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T claims that up to 15% of the customers who shifted to MCI in recent 
months either were duped by sales representatives or had never talked to an MCI 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
MCI spokesman John Houser acknowledged that deceptive practices occur in direct 
marketing programs but insisted that MCI and Pioneer punish or fire anyone who 
uses them. He also noted that AT&amp;T sales agents have used similar tactics. 
He said AT&amp;T was just "whining" because it is losing market share. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for federal and state regulatory agencies said they were aware of 
such problems, but said they were common to many direct-sales campaigns and are 
corrected when consumers complain. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, customers must choose a primary 
long-distance carrier for their telephone service. They can change carriers at 
will -- either by calling their local phone company and requesting a new 
primary long-distance carrier, or by telling the new carrier to make the change 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Local phone companies charge customers a state-authorized fee for making the 
computer change that automatically routes long-distance calls to the designated 
carrier's network. 
</P>
<P>
According to AT&amp;T's lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, MCI sales 
agents told some AT&amp;T customers that AT&amp;T no longer handled 
long-distance calls. In some cases, the suit said, the agents said AT&amp;T was 
going out of business. In still others, however, AT&amp;T customers had their 
accounts changed without any contact from a sales agent, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Houser of MCI called AT&amp;T's examples of false sales claims "ludicrous." But 
he acknowledged that fraudulent sales -- claimed by agents who work on 
commission -- likely occur in any direct-marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"This has always been a concern," Houser said. "It's nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
He added that MCI's customers "have on occasion told us that they have been 
switched over to AT&amp;T" without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
But given the "millions of calls a month" made by carriers to solicit 
customers, he added, the number of complaints on all sides "is not large." 
Houser added that "It definitely is not a corporate strategy." He said the vast 
majority of customers who are switched to MCI have no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Houser said MCI would "evaluate" AT&amp;T's petition that the FCC require 
customers to make written authorization, but considers the present situation 
adequate and convenient to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Filer, who supervises telecommunications for the consumer affairs branch 
of the California Public Utilities Commission, said the problem is not unique 
to AT&amp;T or MCI. "It is industrywide," he said. Nonetheless, he added, many 
customers prefer handling a change by phone "and letting the carrier do the 
legwork." 
</P>
<P>
While saying deceptive sales practices are "a growing problem," Filer said he 
had heard nothing about it from AT&amp;T "until about 10 days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Houser countered by claiming that AT&amp;T was stunned by the numbers of 
defecting customers. "They talk about promoting competition on the one hand, 
but when they get it they complain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's lawsuit is not the first pitting it against its original 
long-distance competitor reaching back two decades. MCI sued and AT&amp;T 
countersued last October over what each called the other's false claims in 
television ads. Those cases are pending. 
</P>

Pepperell Deal Financing May Be in Trouble: Chicago businessman William Farley 
may be having trouble financing his $1.56-billion acquisition of West 
Point-Pepperell Inc., according to published reports. The New York Times cited 
an SEC filing saying banks that made a $1.03-billion bridge loan to West 
Point-Pepperell had agreed to extend the loan through March and perhaps through 
June in return for additional fees and higher interest rates. The banks in turn 
granted West Point-Pepperell permission to advance money to West Point 
Acquisition Corp., a company owned by Farley that owns 95% of Pepperell.

Insider Trading Charged in Pillsbury Deal: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission sued a Minneapolis lawyer, alleging that he traded on inside 
information on Grand Metropolitan PLC's takeover of Pillsbury Co. and made 
about $4.36 million in illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota. It named James 
O'Hagan, 53, a lawyer who formerly worked for the firm Dorsey &amp; Whitney, 
which helped represent Grand Metropolitan in the takeover battle. After 
bitterly resisting the takeover bid, Pillsbury agreed to be bought by the 
British food and drink conglomerate in December, 1988, for $5.7 billion.

Philip R. Lochner Jr., general counsel of Time Warner Inc., has been nominated 
by President Bush to fill a vacancy on the five-member Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination to the body that regulates the nation's stock and bond markets 
is subject to confirmation by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil Lochner has an excellent resume. He appears to have the potential to make 
an outstanding SEC commissioner," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), the 
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which will consider the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at Time Warner's offices in New York, Lochner declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, Lochner would serve out the remaining 17 months of 
the term of David S. Ruder, who stepped down last year and was succeeded as SEC 
chairman by Bush aide Richard C. Breeden. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden, who was a colleague of Lochner's when both were in private practice at 
the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, hailed the nomination.

LAWMAKERS WANT TO ABOLISH THRIFT REGULATORY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the House Banking Committee are talking about abolishing the new 
office Congress established last August to regulate thrift institutions during 
the 1989 savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that he will introduce a bill 
when Congress reconvenes to eliminate the Treasury Department's Office of 
Thrift Supervision and turn its authority over to two bank regulators, the 
Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach has been advocated by Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the 
second-ranking Republican on the banking committee. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer said M. Danny Wall's resignation as the thrift office's top official 
"presents us with a tremendous opportunity to straighten out a regulatory 
system that most agree has been jerry-built." 
</P>
<P>
Wall, after being harshly questioned by the House panel in six weeks of 
hearings last fall over his regulation of the now collapsed Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, announced in December that he would step down from 
the job as soon as President Bush finds a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The new thrift office in the Treasury Department was established as part of a 
$160-billion taxpayer bailout of S&amp;L losses to replace the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board as the industry's chief regulator. 
</P>
<P>
A former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) and one-time staff chief of 
the Senate Banking Committee, Wall had chaired the bank board for slightly more 
than a year prior to its abolition. 
</P>
<P>
While effectively making S&amp;Ls come into compliance with federal banking 
rules, Schumer complained that last year's bailout law also allowed them to 
retain their own separate regulator, "leaving open the potential for the same 
abuses that scarred the industry and depositors in the past." 
</P>
<P>
"Since the two agencies promulgate regulations that are required by law to have 
the same practical effect, it is clear that only one body is necessary," he 
said of the thrift and comptroller's offices. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer said his bill would gradually merge the thrift office into the 
Comptroller of the Currency's agency to coincide with the scheduled phase-out 
in 1994 of the Resolution Trust Corp., another new agency established in the 
bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
The trust corporation's primary function is disposing of up to $400 billion in 
real estate and other property collateralizing soured loans by failed thrifts 
that have been or will be taken over by the government.

Champion International Corp. will temporarily close its Roseburg plywood plant 
Friday for at least two to four weeks due to market conditions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 400 employees of the company's only Oregon facility were notified of the 
closing this week, said Tucker Hill, a Western regional spokesman for Champion 
in Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of logs has been going up substantially more than the increase in 
the price of products, so the gap is widening," Hill said. "We'd like to see 
two to four weeks to see how things stabilize."

PROSECUTION SAYS MCKINZIE LOOTED THRIFT; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: THE DEFENSE IN THE FRAUD TRIAL CALLS HER A DRUG ADDICT WITH SUCH A 
LOW IQ THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE PULLED OFF THE SCAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecution said she jet-setted around the West Coast, setting up phony 
deals and phony papers so she could steal millions of dollars from an Orange 
County thrift and spend it on fur coats, cocktail dresses and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The defense said she was a drug addict with a low IQ, barely able to get out of 
bed in the morning, much less carry out a complicated scheme to loot some $16.6 
million from now-defunct North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the portraits painted Tuesday of Janet Faye McKinzie in opening 
statements in her bank fraud trial in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie is facing 40 counts of bank fraud, conspiracy and racketeering in 
connection with the 1987 collapse of North America, which ultimately cost 
taxpayers some $120 million. If convicted, she could receive more than 200 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift's founder and chairman -- former Westminster dentist Duayne D. 
Christensen -- is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, having died in a 
mysterious car crash only 9 1/2 hours before regulators seized North America. 
</P>
<P>
"North America with an American Eagle as its logo -- a symbol of freedom and 
prosperity -- instead became a company operated by two individuals who 
conducted its affairs through a pattern of racketeering," Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Nancy Wieben Stock told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Stock said McKinzie spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of depositors' funds 
on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"First-class travel, first-class accommodations. Lear jet travel to wherever 
she wanted to go. McKinzie enjoyed all of the accouterments of power at North 
America," Stock said. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie flew to such places as Utah and Arizona, allegedly as part of an 
elaborate fraud she perpetrated with Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Richard (Racehorse) Haynes -- McKinzie's attorney -- said his client was 
innocent of any wrongdoing and pinned the blame for North America's collapse on 
Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
"The wrong person is on trial here today," Haynes said. "Dr. Duayne Christensen 
should be seated in this seat." 
</P>
<P>
He characterized Christensen as a malevolent pill pusher, plying his client 
with prescription medication that turned McKinzie into "a robot" who simply 
followed the former dentist's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes said Christensen's professional designation of D.D.S. -- which is listed 
after a dentist's surname -- really stood for "dishonesty, deception and 
seduction." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes is using a "diminished capacity" defense, claiming that McKinzie was 
unwittingly duped into carrying out the alleged fraud because she was 
involuntarily intoxicated by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Stock, however, said it was McKinzie who was in control at North America rather 
than Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well known at North America that what McKinzie says, goes," Stock said. 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a two-phase condominium project in San Jose as proof. The 
government has alleged that McKinzie had more than $5.5 million worth of phony 
invoices and check requests intended to pay for supposed construction work on 
the second phase of the project, known as Summerton. The government claims that 
the construction was never done and that the money was used for fraudulent 
purposes, including McKinzie's "personal enrichment." 
</P>
<P>
"Phase Two was nothing but dirt," Stock said. 
</P>
<P>
Just three days before his death, Christensen rewrote his will to name McKinzie 
as sole beneficiary. The proceeds from a $10-million life insurance policy have 
been frozen by a federal judge pending the outcome of several lawsuits against 
McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state regulators say the life insurance proceeds were just the 
final chapter in a massive fraud, but Haynes tried to show the jury that it was 
just another move by Christensen to make McKinzie look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after death, Dr. Christensen was trying to manipulate the life of Janet 
Faye McKinzie," Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes told jurors that his client was incapable of carrying out a massive 
fraud on her own, even without being on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence will show that the woman upon whom you sit in judgment, Janet 
Faye McKinzie, is a 40-year-old high school dropout with an IQ of between 86 
and 97," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes at one point compared Christensen to Pavlov, the Russian physiologist 
who trained dogs through a reward-and-punishment system. 
</P>
<P>
After opening statements, former North America President Brooks A. Miller took 
the stand and testified about some of the thrift's deals. Haynes is expected to 
cross-examine Miller today.

SLOAN FOUNDATION TO FUND STUDY ON U.S. COMPETITIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation will give nearly $3 million to five universities 
to study the problems that U.S. companies have competing in the international 
marketplace, the New York-based foundation was scheduled to announce today. 
</P>
<P>
"Competitiveness is an issue that a lot of people are writing about," said 
David J. Teece, head of UC Berkeley's Consortium on Competitiveness and 
Cooperation, which will manage the $2.97-million grant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing as well as we could, as well as we have historically and as 
well as the leading nations we trade with. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. economy is in decline . . . and it's not necessary. If we want to set 
a new course, we can." 
</P>
<P>
Faculty from Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia, Harvard and MIT will participate, 
representing a variety of disciplines, including economics, management and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
The study is unusual because it requires extensive cooperation from U.S. 
industry, said Ralph E. Gomory, president of the Sloan Foundation. The chief 
executives of five companies -- General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett 
Packard, IBM and Xerox -- have guaranteed cooperation by their firms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 3-to-5-year study, the corporations will help the consortium decide 
what issues to examine, will provide data and will give "a perspective from 
people actually involved in competition on a global basis," Teece said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't deal with competitiveness in a quick and ad hoc fashion," Gomory 
said. "Scholarship without contact with reality isn't very useful." 
</P>
<P>
The grant is the Sloan Foundation's largest to a university in 25 years. The 
private foundation is a major funding source for college and university 
research in science, economics, engineering, public policy and management.

THREE-YEAR PACKAGE FOR MEXICO'S DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bank committee evaluating Mexico's massive foreign debt said Wednesday that 
it has agreed on a three-year plan to finance $48 billion in commercial bank 
debt and will send the pact to 450 creditor banks for their expected approval. 
</P>
<P>
Signing of the agreement was expected in early February, said the announcement 
by Mexican Finance Ministry undersecretary Angel Gurria and William Rhodes, 
co-chairmen of the 15-member bank committee for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Gurria and Rhodes said virtually all of Mexico's 450 bank creditors worldwide 
have committed to the package for 1989-92, which covers basically all the 
nation's medium- and long-term commercial bank debt of about $48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If the package garners the expected bank approval, it will bring significant 
debt relief to Mexico and represent an important victory for the debt-relief 
program championed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican debt plan is seen as the first full implementation of Brady's 
well-received approach and as a model for solving the Third World debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico and its commercial bank creditors reached a tentative agreement July 24 
under which Mexico would be granted a 35% reduction in its $53-billion 
commercial debt. The commercial bank advisory committee for Mexico was charged 
with working out the details of the tentative pact. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's foreign debt totals $104 billion, about $51 billion of it owed to the 
World Bank and other international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the $5 billion in commercial bank debt not included in the 
package announced Wednesday was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes and Gurria praised what they called the ground-breaking work of the 
commercial bank committee. "The positive response is unprecedented in any 
package of this magnitude since the debt crisis broke out in August, 1982," 
Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three basic options offered to banks in the package, about 41% of the 
total exposure has committed to principal-reduction bonds, about 49% to 
debt-service-reduction bonds and about 10% to new money, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
"The package offers Mexico the support it needs from the commercial banks to 
carry out its program of economic reform and growth, to leave the debt crisis 
behind it and to look with confidence to the future," Gurria said. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in December, 1988, in the midst 
of Mexico's debt crisis, but resisted intense pressure to declare a moratorium 
on debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
"I will avoid confrontation," Salinas said in his inaugural speech. "But I 
declare emphatically and with conviction that the interests of Mexicans come 
before those of (foreign) creditors. The priority now will be not to pay, but 
to return to growth."

DELTA SAYS EARNINGS DECLINED IN PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delta Air Lines, squeezed by higher fuel costs and soft traffic, said Wednesday 
that its earnings in the quarter that ended in December will be lower than in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Delta's announcement signals hard times ahead for the 
airlines, which recently lowered fares on key routes to spark travel during the 
slow winter months. John Pincavage, an analyst with the Transportation Group 
Ltd. investment firm in New York, said 1990 is shaping up as a dismal year for 
the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Pincavage expects the industry to lose as much as $600 million during the first 
three months of 1990, its biggest quarterly loss in seven years. "It is going 
to be a disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Delta did not estimate its December quarter earnings and said that, despite 
disappointing quarterly results, its earnings for the year would set a record. 
But analysts sharply lowered their quarterly estimates for Delta, some by as 
much as 70%. Pincavage said he expects Delta to make just half the $1.73 it 
earned per share in the last three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pincavage and other industry analysts said the airlines -- after enjoying a 
strong first half in 1989 -- received a double whammy in December in the form 
of sharply higher fuel prices and unusually light passenger travel. The 
airlines last week raised ticket prices slightly to cover fuel costs, but that 
move is expected to discourage discretionary travel. 
</P>
<P>
"If traffic weakens further, the airlines will have to cut fares to put people 
on," Pincavage said. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines' difficulties may be compounded by the huge expansion plans under 
way at most major airlines. Fleet capacity is expected to grow by 9% to 10% 
this year with the acquisition of new aircraft and the anticipated comeback of 
financially troubled Eastern Airlines. Meanwhile, passenger traffic is expected 
to rise only 2% to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The need to fill the newly acquired aircraft is expected to place additional 
pressure on the airlines to reduce fares. 
</P>
<P>
This may be good news for the consumer, but it is bad news for the airlines. 
Raymond Neidl, an analyst with the investment firm of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in 
New York, advised investors Wednesday to avoid airline bonds because of the 
industry's poor earnings outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Neidl said he did not single out any particular companies, adding, "The problem 
is pretty much across the board."

VIOLENCE: STRANGERS MAY POSE DANGERS, BUT CHANCES ARE, IF YOU ARE MURDERED, IT

ACQUAINTANCE.

<P>
About 20,000 times each year in the United States, murderers shoot, stab, 
strangle, mangle and perform other unthinkable acts. 
</P>
<P>
The public's perception is that most of these murders are random acts of 
violence, and in gang-plagued urban areas that perception is fueled by nightly 
news of drive-by shootings and other atrocities. No wonder the murder of Boston 
attorney Carol Stuart caught the attention of an entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Stuart's husband, Charles, claimed their car was invaded by a 
black assailant after the couple left a childbirth class at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. Charles Stuart was seriously wounded. Carol Stuart died shortly after 
their son was delivered by Cesarean section; the premature baby lived only 17 
days. Boston police launched a massive manhunt for the criminal; it was 
reported that Stuart identified a suspect in a police lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Three months after the crime, Charles Stuart apparently jumped from a bridge to 
his death after he learned he had become the chief suspect in the case. If 
Charles Stuart indeed killed his wife, her death fits a pattern. In more than 
60% of the murders committed in the United States, the killer was someone the 
victim knew. 
</P>
<P>
The Stuart case fed the nation's fears on two levels: fear of random violence 
and fear of racially motivated crime. Officials' belief in Stuart's story and 
the subsequent discovery that he was the likely killer has left Boston in the 
midst of what Mayor Raymond L. Flynn has called its worst racial crisis since 
the mid-1970s riots over court-ordered school desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, if we are murdered, chances are it will be by a relative, roommate, 
co-worker, neighbor or some other acquaintance. Carol Stuart's killing was 
sensational, but not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
And it is one of many such cases to garner national headlines. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* In 1985 the body of Arleta teen-ager Michele Avila was found in a creek in 
Angeles National Forest. Shortly thereafter, her best friend, Karen Severson, 
moved into the family home to console the grieving mother. Severson was later 
arrested, along with another friend, for the crime. Their trial started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1986, in Port Angeles, Wash., preacher Grady Young told authorities that 
burglars killed his wife of 38 years, but he was convicted of the crime in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1975 Tommy Zeigler, a Winter Garden, Fla., furniture store owner told 
police that unknown assailants shot his wife Eunice, her parents, and a 
customer in his store. Zeigler was convicted in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1970 Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald claimed a band of drug-crazed hippies invaded 
his Ft. Bragg, N.C., home and murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters. 
MacDonald was convicted of the crime in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, "over half the murder victims in 
1988 were related to (15%) or acquainted with (40%) their assailants." Twelve 
percent were murdered by strangers, and "the relationships among victims and 
offenders were unknown in 33% of the murders." (Police and social scientists 
assume there is a connection between victim and murderer in a large portion of 
homicides where the relationship is listed as unknown.) 
</P>
<P>
Police officials in several jurisdictions list statistics that confirm the 
national trend. Of eight murders in Santa Monica last year, six were committed 
by people known to the victims, according to Police Detective Steve Rosenfeld. 
Detective Rick Swanston of the LAPD's West Valley Division reports that 10 of 
last year's 12 homicides were committed by people the victims knew. And at the 
Van Nuys Division, Detective Jim Vojtecky says that victims knew their 
murderers in 25 of the 26 homicide cases solved last year. (Citywide statistics 
were not available.) 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Stuart murder and the racial tensions it has exacerbated in 
Boston, social scientists, psychologists and legal experts say they hope 
Americans will start to explore the reality of violence instead of continuing 
to believe the mythology of random attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that people want to ignore reality" and prefer to think 
homicide occurs on dark seamy streets where evil strangers lurk, as it seemed 
at first in the Stuart case, said Venice attorney Paul Mones, who specializes 
in cases of children who murder their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely," Mones said, "that the person who assaults you in a parking 
lot is likely to be your boyfriend or girlfriend or someone hired by them than 
it is a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
"The same is true in terms of a little girl who has been abducted, raped and 
killed. We think it's some guy drooling in a beat-up car, as opposed to a 
well-dressed uncle, father or neighbor who knows the kid. But it's more often 
the well-dressed father, the businessman, not the strangers" who do the deeds. 
</P>
<P>
Added Mones: "Crime statistics show if you added together all the drug-related 
homicides, you still would not approach" the number of relatives and friends 
who kill each each other every year. 
</P>
<P>
It's much easier -- and much more comfortable -- experts say, to believe that a 
murderer is a stranger rather than someone we know. We are, said Mones, lulled 
into the belief that the family is a bastion of tranquillity and peace. 
</P>
<P>
Boston police seemed to embrace Charles Stuart's story of a nightmarish attack, 
although, according to Mones, "the circumstances of the homicide would lead an 
objective investigator" to look at the person who reported the crime as a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on newspaper reports this guy took out an insurance policy on his wife 
right before she died. But still the police didn't ask. They just accepted the 
fact that it's a black man. A stranger. And the black community is up in arms, 
justifiably." 
</P>
<P>
Mones is one of many observers who say that physical violence has become so 
subtly woven into the fabric of family life, and into our culture, that most 
people are incapable of recognizing that violence when it is happening to them. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Dutton, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia 
and an expert on family violence agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"People overestimate the danger of being attacked on the street and 
underestimate the danger of being attacked at home," he said, adding that 
family violence experts estimate that anywhere from 30% to 75% of all marriages 
experience violence between the partners at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton and others say that media coverage of violent crime influences our 
perception of the likelihood of the event; drive-by shootings make for more 
sensational news coverage than do the more frequent episodes of family 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 6.5% of wife assaults, for example, even get reported to the police, and 
a very low percentage of those ever make it to the courts or result in 
conviction," Dutton said. "For that same reason we overestimate our danger of 
dying in a plane crash -- crashes always make the news -- and underestimate our 
danger of drowning. Drownings are more frequent but rarely get coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Williams is a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire 
and a research associate at the school's Family Research Laboratory, which 
studies family violence. Based on studies he's read, he thinks as many as 75% 
of homicides committed in this country are done by people who at least know 
each other, and about 25% are family-related. 
</P>
<P>
To understand murder, he said, "We have to look at what's going on inside the 
homes in this country. Historically, the home has been seen as a place of 
peace, solace, warmth and love." But no more. "Once you look behind the closed 
doors, you see a very violent place." 
</P>
<P>
Home is a place where, in any given year, a number of physically aggressive 
acts are likely to take place, committed by one family member against another. 
It could be as mild as a push or a grab, Williams said. It could also be severe 
battery, sometimes repeated, he added. 
</P>
<P>
A common finding in family violence research, Williams said, is that children 
who see violence at home tend to think it is acceptable, and grow up to 
establish violence-prone families of their own. "They think it's OK for people 
who love each other to hit each other," Williams said. And in many cases, when 
family members kill each other, its just because the small acts of violence 
have escalated into a larger one. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions are hard to come by, said Williams. But if things don't change, "the 
sanctity and privacy of the home may be in question," with societal 
intervention mandated by government authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We most often presume that that married lives are harmonious, that spouses 
care for each other and that things are good or the couple wouldn't stay 
together," said Julie Blackman, author of "Intimate Violence" (Columbia 
University Press) and a forensic psychologist and teacher at the Eugene Lang 
College of the New School for Social Research in New York. "For many that is 
incorrect. For some it couldn't be more wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Certain people don't recognize trouble because they're living it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to recognize the extent of your own suffering or to be insightful 
when you are in pain," said Blackman, who added that women, especially, have a 
tendency not to recognize violence in the context of intimate relationships, 
even when they are suffering its effects. 
</P>
<P>
That's because "violence is not self-defining. When people hit each other, they 
provide the definition (of what's violent and what isn't) as they go along. 
They say, 'I'm only doing this to you to teach you a lesson.' " The injured 
person does not think of it as a violent act. 
</P>
<P>
"People who look at battered women," for example, "think they must know that 
what's been done to them is wrong," she said. "But as a culture, we don't know. 
We're not singular in our response to violence. There's no separate standard 
that informs us violence is bad." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "We have . . . a lot of violent themes in our culture" evidenced 
even in children's cartoons. By allowing it, we signal that violence is 
sometimes appropriate. "The good signal would be that it is never appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mones believes that police training could be modified to help officers better 
deal with the family violence they're confronted with on a daily basis. And 
nonviolence training for parents would be helpful, too. "If we have driver 
education, we should also have parent education." 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have, on a state or national level, a coherent family violence 
policy," Mones said. And that is tragic, he adds, because research proves that 
the whole, senseless cycle of violence is broken when people are taught there 
can be another way.

BARBARA WALTERS REGALES WOMEN OF JEWISH FUND

"You're not going to find out I had an abortion of a baby by Frank Sinatra," 
Barbara Walters says of two unauthorized biographies coming out later this 
year, including one by Jerry Oppenheimer, co-author of an unauthorized book 
about Rock Hudson in 1986. "In a strange way I'm curious," Walters said of 
Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking, what can he write to make it juicy?" 
</P>
<P>
A chatty Walters regaled a luncheon gathering of 62 women who belong to the 
elite Chai Committee of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Fund in Los 
Angeles. The event kicked off the organization's annual fund-raising effort, 
which Walters noted was impressive. Last year, members of the Chai Committee 
donated a total of $2.5 million to the UJF, supporting social service agencies 
in Los Angeles, Israel and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Walters, without question in my mind, is the most prestigious Jewish 
woman in the country and probably the world, and certainly the most 
recognizable," said Harriet Hochman, campaign chair of the Greater Los Angeles 
Women's Division, adding that the newswoman "practically moved mountains to be 
with us." On Saturday, Walters departs for Czechoslovakia to interview 
president Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch took place in and around a recently built Chinese-style Beverly Hills 
mansion said to be an exact reproduction of a Suchow province country estate, 
save, of course, for the two tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
When guests, including event chairman Beverly Mitchell, Sylvia Hirschfield, 
Dorothy Corwin, Diane Glazer, Dorothy Goren, Annette Shapiro, Elaine Goldsmith, 
Sally Kurtzman, Marion Smooke, Edna Weiss and Dorothy Lyon, weren't marveling 
over the mansion's contents they were marveling over Walters. Recounting her 
meetings with world leaders, Walters divulged that the most charismatic was the 
late Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat. "Even if I were speaking to another 
group, I'd still say the same thing."

UNFINISHED BUSINESS AT THE HAMMER MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: WESTWOOD CENTER'S BUSINESS PLAN PROJECTS HEFTY PROFITS EVEN AS FINANCIAL 
TROUBLES SEEM TO BE CURTAILING CONSTRUCTION OF THE MOST LUCRATIVE FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though legally established as a nonprofit entity, the Armand Hammer Museum of 
Art and Cultural Center, under construction in Westwood, sees itself as an "an 
entrepreneurial venture" that will make hefty profits, according to a key 
document obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, meetings under way at the headquarters of Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., which is financing the museum, are apparently close to 
producing a decision that cost overruns have made it impossible for the museum 
to complete several key facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The contradictory images of the museum as a high-return business bonanza but 
also cost-hamstrung project that faces significant difficulty have emerged in 
newly disclosed documents pertaining to the project and from sources close to 
its financing. 
</P>
<P>
In its official business plan, copies of which have surfaced in the last few 
weeks, the museum has projected a net profit of more than $1.5 million in its 
first year of operation. And in an ambitious marketing program, the Hammer 
museum emphasizes the crucial role in its operation of high profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
It dismisses the potential for "competitive threats" from other museums as 
unlikely because Southern California's existing museum and nonprofit cultural 
communities "react very slowly to changes." 
</P>
<P>
By cutting back on services central to the operation of most museums -- 
including elimination of any curatorial department -- and taking advantage of 
the lack of vigor among other area cultural centers, the Hammer facility boasts 
that it will seize a position as "The Museum in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The business plan details for the first time the actual operational style of 
the Hammer museum, which is named for Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman 
Armand Hammer, one of the nation's most prominent and controversial art 
collectors. Hammer decided to construct the museum -- initially at an estimated 
cost of $50 million in Occidental funds -- in late 1987 after he pulled out of 
an agreement to donate his art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Hammer museum has been hamstrung by construction cost overruns 
and by the emergence of new details -- chiefly in court documents filed in a 
Delaware shareholder lawsuit challenging the propriety of Occidental 
Petroleum's expenditures on the project -- that have established that the oil 
company, and not Hammer, actually paid for a collection of Leonardo da Vinci 
drawings that makes up one of the three central elements of Hammer's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, overruns threatened to push the construction cost as high as 
$80 million and Occidental Petroleum officials stepped in to demand reductions 
-- to a total of not more than $60 million. The museum is scheduled to open 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, museum officials across the country -- including the director of the 
Phillips Collection in Washington, which the Hammer museum business plan 
identifies as highly similar to the vision it has for itself -- questioned many 
Hammer financial premises. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the Hammer museum situation said meetings have been under 
way this week at Occidental Petroleum to put in final form reductions in the 
museum construction budget in which oil company officials have apparently 
decided the Hammer facility cannot afford to complete its library, restaurant 
and auditorium. The apparent decision closely parallels a proposed resolution 
of the cost overrun problem Occidental officials first broached late last year. 
</P>
<P>
But in the business plan, the restaurant and auditorium are characterized as 
major profit centers. Occidental Petroleum on Wednesday declined to discuss the 
museum's business plan, the reported cost-control activities or the meetings 
reportedly occurring this week. "I would just say that we're in litigation and 
would have no comment," said Frank Ashley, an Occidental spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The business plan describes the restaurant as a place where "one might have 
seen Monet sipping his espresso over afternoon repast at a similar cafe of the 
period." And to the consternation of many museum directors, who say museum 
restaurants often are notorious money-losers, the Hammer plan anticipates 
$82,000 in first year cafeteria profits -- and $298,000 by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium, which would be rented by an aggressive sales force operating 
chiefly on commission, projects profits in the business plan of between 
$292,000 and $547,000 a year. Not operating the facilities could cut the profit 
even under the business plan's formula by nearly 50% by 1995. The business plan 
makes no provision for an inability to open any of the museum's promised 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the plan sees the Hammer museum as a bottom line bonanza with rates of 
return of between 20% and 26.2% -- profit margins that would be the envy of 
virtually every retail business in California. By the 1994-1995 fiscal year, 
the Hammer museum envisions making nearly $2 million a year on revenues of 
slightly less than $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic details are contained in a confidential business plan for the 
institution that has been among the most closely held of all museum documents. 
The plan, however, does not indicate how the anticipated profits will be spent. 
The museum plan includes no indication of expanding scholarly programs that 
will be financed by the millions of dollars in anticipated black ink. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the business plan is among thousands of pages of documents on file in 
Delaware state chancery court in Wilmington in a shareholder suit that seeks to 
derail construction of the museum as an improper use of funds of the Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But the copy in official court files is completely illegible. The Times 
obtained readable versions of the documents from Occidental and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is being built to house Hammer's personal art collection, which has 
been valued at as much as $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Hammer museum) will fill an acknowledged cultural void that is perceived 
in sophisticated cities around the world," the business plan promises. The 
museum "will quickly establish itself as one of the finest museums on the West 
Coast and in the country. It will be the Museum in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
But the business plan appears to envision the Hammer museum chiefly as a 
profit-oriented business and not a cultural or scholarly institution. The 
museum, the business plan contends, "will employ an aggressive marketing 
strategy, treating the museum as an entrepreneurial venture that must be 
profitable as opposed to the stereotypical 'nonprofit' museum that is a money 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
"An emphasis will be on 'creative financing.' A perpetual monthly award will go 
the the employee who implements the most creative (legal) method of obtaining a 
product or service." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the business plan appears to dismiss virtually the entire 
Southern California museum community as worthy cultural partners or business 
affiliates. "Competitive threats to the museum are very unlikely from existing 
museums or any new museums since the (Hammer) museum and nonprofit industries 
react very slowly to changes." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the plan shows the museum anticipates: 
</P>
<P>
* Profits totaling $7.94 million in its first five years of operation on 
revenues of $34.3 million. The museum also proposes to recruit 24 wealthy 
"founding members" -- individuals or corporations. To maintain their status in 
the museum, the founding members would be required to donate $50,000 a year to 
the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
* An attendance fee system in which admission charges would be eliminated, but 
would be replaced by the sale of "daily memberships" in the museum, of between 
$2 and $4.50 per person. Income from membership sales is projected at $1.2 
million in the museum's first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
* First year attendance of 330,000, growing at a rate of between 5% and 25% 
annually until 1994-95, when 526,000 customers are anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
* A bare-bones staff that includes no curator and projects a salary for the 
museum's sole full-time education department employee of $10,000 a year. The 
library -- the opening of which is apparently threatened -- would be staffed by 
one librarian and a student assistant. The security force would consist of 20 
retired people who would be paid $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
* No in-house conservation department -- despite the enormous value of many of 
the Hammer artworks. Outside conservation contractors would be used at a first 
year cost of$10,000. To avoid paying for health care and pension benefits for 
as many of its employees as possible, the museum would make maximum use of 
part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the business plan details are seemingly at odds with practices of many 
established institutions. Museum officials across the country challenged the 
realism of the document. Though the Hammer museum identifies itself as similar 
in style, scope and audience with Washington's Phillips Collection, that 
institution's director was openly skeptical of the Hammer museum's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the circumstances of Westwood and what kinds of crowds can be 
collected," said Laughlin Phillips, of the Phillips Collection. "But it would 
be very hard for us to even come close to those figures." 
</P>
<P>
The long-established Phillips Collection, which has just completed an ambitious 
expansion and renovation program and is perceived as the premier modern art 
facility in the nation's capital, draws fewer than half the number of visitors 
the Hammer museum projects, Phillips said. Although the Phillips Collection has 
revised its business practices and undergone a period of what Phillips called 
"tremendous growth" in the last decade, he said the museum's operating budget 
for 1988 -- the last full fiscal year the museum has completed -- was only 
about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips particularly questioned the Hammer museum's plan to hire a museum 
director for $70,000 a year. "For the director, I think it would be very hard 
to find somebody at that amount. I presume they're looking for somebody who's 
already well known. They'd have to go higher." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles museums also questioned some of the Hammer projections. The J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Malibu, for instance, said its modern plant requires a security 
force of 50 people -- double the Hammer contingent -- to adequately guard its 
priceless artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art said that although it is widely 
perceived as a model of successful operations in a new museum, its 1989 
attendance was only 287,000. The museum showed an operating loss of $77,000 on 
revenues of $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In all, said Phillips, even without the construction budget setbacks that have 
troubled the Hammer museum, the business plan seems to describe a situation 
that may be little more than a pipe dream. "To hear that an institution can 
zoom out of the starting gate so quickly and immediately turn a profit," he 
said, "does seem to me unrealistic."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV, RADIO ANCHORS FAWN OVER OLLIE SHOW

They shook hands, embraced, socialized, posed for pictures, ate fruit tarts and 
looked simply terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Being a local news anchor in Los Angeles is a demanding, challenging, 
oppressive, exhausting, grueling, excruciatingly hard job. But somebody has to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
Take Tuesday, the day Oliver L. North addressed the Hollywood Radio and 
Television Society in Beverly Hills. Sharing a two-tiered dais with North -- 
the retired Marine officer convicted of shredding government papers in the 
Iran-Contra affair -- were 14 local television and radio anchors. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie's trolley. 
</P>
<P>
There was so much glitter you almost needed sun glasses. It was the local-news 
equivalent of one of those group photographs of old MGM stars, for the assembly 
of gleaming hood ornaments included some of the town's biggest TV celebrities: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lampley and Bree Walker of KCBS Channel 2, Kelly Lange of KNBC Channel 4, 
Harold Greene and Tawny Little of KABC Channel 7 and his royal Dunphyship 
himself, Jerry Dunphy of KCAL Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
Befitting their exalted status, these super elite occupied the same front dais 
as North, segregated from an upper dais occupied by the merely elite Hal 
Fishman and Jann Carl of KTLA Channel 5, Larry Attebery and Wanda Starke of 
KCOP Channel 13, Pat Lalama of KTTV Channel 11, Tom Sirmons and David Zorn of 
KNX radio and Charlie Brailer of KFWB radio, who was seated beside the 
station's executive editor, Bill Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
Before lunch, North and the anchors were guests at a "no press" reception, 
which, when you think about it, wasn't a paradox. 
</P>
<P>
Society executive director Oliver H. Crawford said none of the anchors he 
invited to appear with North rejected the invitation, although a few who 
accepted were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Look, everyone likes a nice lunch out. Yet why would news anchors -- who at 
least bear the trappings of journalists -- accept invitations to appear on a 
stage with a controversial public figure who was was likely to -- and did -- 
give a highly partisan and politicized speech? 
</P>
<P>
The local-news people were appearing with North "without any commitment 
whatsoever as to the activities (of) our speaker," society president William M. 
Haber assured the industry crowd before his introductions. 
</P>
<P>
No? Then why were these clods there? The food wasn't that good. Nor was the 
Reagan-boosting, Gorbachev-bashing speech. To prove it, there were times when 
anchor eyes seemed to glaze over. These things happen when your life is 
20-second sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Haber's disclaimer, the news crowd's participation (some posed 
for pictures with North) gave at least the appearance of an endorsement of 
North, violating the separation of news reporter and news maker. The same taboo 
against participation would apply if the speaker had been someone as liberal 
and politically different from North as, say, Ramsey Clark. 
</P>
<P>
The anchors showed up merely because they were invited, apparently, and because 
the opportunity to display themselves before so many show-business powerhouses 
was just too tempting to pass up. It was one happy family. 
</P>
<P>
"We are, after all, a communications industry," Haber said. And don't forget, 
an entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
That includes most of the anchors, and these days especially Lange, who, in 
addition to co-anchoring two newscasts a night on Channel 4, may soon have her 
own syndicated daily talk show. Well, why not? The station's funny 
weather-caster, Fritz Coleman, hosts his own variety show. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well for Lange, she'll be sharing her cute quips with a national 
audience as co-host of the proposed "Kelly &amp; Gail," with comedy writer Gail 
Parent. Tribune Entertainment is trying to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
According to trade ads, the show is a "survival guide for women" covering such 
commanding topics as "How to Nail Him" and "How to Dress Your Man So You're Not 
Embarrassed to be Seen With Him." All right! 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't the new show be a conflict for Lange? Not to worry. The ad says it's 
"part-talk, part-comedy. . . ." Just like Channel 4 news. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, North -- not the anchors -- was the one damaged by showing 
up Tuesday.

MAIN STREET U.S.A.; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORHOODS: AMID A PUSH FOR DEVELOPMENT, A BLOCKLONG STRETCH OF LARCHMONT 
BOULEVARD STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN ITS PERSONAL, HOMEY CHARACTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While other areas of Los Angeles have lurched into the future with the 
construction of gigantic shopping malls and other grand-scale developments, a 
blocklong section of Larchmont Boulevard south of Hollywood has remained a 
time-capsule reflection of Main Street U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a little tiny village in the middle of this big city," said 
Australian-born Rachel Pawsey, now a Los Angeles resident, as she relaxed on a 
bench one recent afternoon with her squirming 3-year-old nephew, Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
Having completed a daily quest for ice cream -- with a quick look in the pet 
and toy store windows -- on the strip between Beverly Boulevard and and 1st 
Street, Pawsey and Charlie became part of the small-town atmosphere of 
Larchmont Village, a rare Los Angeles business district where the shops depend 
heavily on foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the extremities of the strip have been nibbled away 
by banks and real estate offices that have moved in. Many business owners and 
neighbors are now concerned that an influx of such businesses -- better able to 
afford soaring rents but that do not attract browsers -- will gradually chip 
away at the unique character of Larchmont Village. 
</P>
<P>
That fear was voiced by business owners and residents at a recent meeting 
organized by the Larchmont Boulevard Assn. to discuss a proposal to build a 
real estate office-retail complex and an underground parking lot in the middle 
of the block. 
</P>
<P>
When Western Capital Resources, a real estate purchasing subsidiary of gigantic 
Fred Sands Realtors, agreed to purchase the property at 161-215 N. Larchmont 
Blvd. late last year, Sands representatives were immediately interested in 
housing their local offices in a building to be constructed on the site. But 
Sands officials argued that the project would be economically feasible only if 
it also included the adjacent city-owned 36-space parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Local developer Ronald A. Simms Commercial Development, which held the option 
to build on the parking lot, agreed to a joint-development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Both Simms and Sands officials said they knew the proposal would cause 
consternation among local merchants. Merchants still complain that the 
construction of a subterranean parking lot across the street from the proposed 
development two years ago disrupted business for months. They now say that 
underground parking is inappropriate for the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas W. McCormick of the Sands purchasing subsidiary and Hymie I. Barber 
of Simms argue that the extended block of mostly local businesses can 
incorporate the real estate office, expand parking and still preserve the 
village feel of the street. The proposed development, they said, would include 
street-level shop space, an upstairs Sands office and a single-level 
underground parking lot to replace the city lot. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a development that will take the street into the next century. It will 
be the crowning jewel to Larchmont," Barber told the 60 merchants and neighbors 
who gathered recently to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But the home and shop owners at the meeting, most of whom opposed the Sands 
office proposal, voiced a litany of fears about the "potential encroachment" 
into Larchmont of one more non-retail business and parking problems that real 
estate employees have brought to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Though McCormick and Barber insisted that the real estate office would hardly 
affect the street-level charm of Larchmont, many who spoke at the meeting, as 
well as Larchmont browsers and shop owners, questioned whether the Fred Sands 
office would expand. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very sure that Fred Sands won't stay on the second floor," said Ann 
Zabonian, owner of Bon Chance, a small shop on the strip. Zabonian was standing 
in the shop doorway on a recent quiet afternoon. "I'm sure things will change 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
Both Barber and McCormick, who were bombarded with criticism at the residents 
meeting, said the area cannot be immune to change, and that residents should 
not oppose all development, but rather demand that it be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
While chatting on the street with a shop owner, even Barber said "real estate 
offices and banks are killing off the street." But he said the Sands proposal 
represents a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to locating retail shops on the ground level to preserve the 
pedestrian feel of the block, Sands officials said they have considered other 
potential complaints, such as the replacement a city parking lot on the 
property with a city-operated underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors and merchants complain that two levels of the existing 
underground lot across the street from the proposed development go virtually 
unused by shoppers who don't feel secure parking underground and who prefer 
street-level lots. They also said that 40 to 50 of the proposed 75 parking 
spaces in a new underground lot would be taken up by Sands employees. 
</P>
<P>
"When we close (the ground-level) lot, people are going to go to the Beverly 
Center instead of Larchmont," said Daryl Trainor, owner of Village Catering. 
"We know from experience that people don't like underground parking." 
</P>
<P>
Barber agreed that the existing underground lot, which his company developed 
two years ago, is under used, but he faults the city of Los Angeles, which 
operates the lot, for not encouraging parking there. He said that if the 
Sands-Simms project goes through, real estate company employees can be 
encouraged to park in both underground lots, freeing street space for shoppers 
and browsers. 
</P>
<P>
Sands and Simms officials, who say the project is not viable unless the city 
parking lot is part of the development, said they would await community input 
and approval before trying to move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Though the city of Los Angeles would have to approve the redevelopment, 
McCormick said the final purchase of the property is not necessarily contingent 
upon the city's decision. Asked what other options were, he said that "given 
the price (of the property) . . . putting the office in upstairs is the way to 
make it work economically." 
</P>
<P>
Marshaling their forces, shop owners have begun petitioning against the 
proposal, and Dr. Timothy C. Gogan, Larchmont Boulevard Assn. president, has 
written a letter to City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the Larchmont 
area, saying that "from petitions . . . and phone calls . . . (we conclude 
that) the people . . . want the city-owned lot to remain as it is." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, shoppers can still stroll the sidewalks, get shoes fixed while 
they wait at Van Dry Clean &amp; Shoe Repair, get a haircut and have a casual 
chat with barber Jerry Cottone at Larchmont Barber Shop, or just sit and take 
in the atmosphere from a park bench or outdoor table. 
</P>
<P>
Though newer, less personal businesses have moved into the area in recent 
years, there are still plenty of owner-operated shops where proprietors and 
employees know many customers by their first names. Although a shoe store that 
provided short-term baby-sitting for customers is now gone, personal contact is 
still an important part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
A young man named Evan, who works at Village Catering, bolted from behind the 
counter on a recent afternoon to play with three small children strolling down 
the street with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Thompson, owner of a small jewelry shop on the strip, spends much time 
popping into to other stores for conversation with fellow owners and quick 
chats with local customers. 
</P>
<P>
Many nearby residents make a point of going to Larchmont to shop or get a 
haircut simply because they enjoy its homey atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Larchmont Boulevard really serves the community," Hannah LeVelle said as she 
sat on a bench bantering and laughing with a friend. "It is a pleasant place to 
come and just look -- to enjoy the fresh air."

'SCREWBALL' FILMS FROM PAST GET A SERIOUS LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the funniest movies ever made are about to be screened at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Friday and continuing through March 3, the museum will present 
"Screwball," a program of comedies from the 1930s and '40s, including "You 
Can't Take It With You" and other classics as well as such rarities as Alfred 
Hitchcock's sole screwball effort, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Haver, director of the museum's film department, said his inspiration 
for the program was friend Ed Sikov's recent publication of "Screwball," the 
first book-length study of vintage madcap. 
</P>
<P>
Haver said he first became enamored of them as a film-smitten adolescent in the 
1950s. He would sit up half the night to catch a butchered-for-TV version of 
"His Girl Friday" or some other classic, then desperately try not to wake up 
the whole house with his guffaws. At the museum, he noted, people will be able 
to see first-rate prints of the films as they were meant to be seen -- larger 
than life, in an auditorium of people roaring with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haver, the form was born in 1934 with either Frank Capra's "It 
Happened One Night" or Howard Hawks' "Twentieth Century." He would give honors 
to the latter because its humor was so pioneeringly off the wall. Hawks' 1952 
"Monkey Business," in which Marilyn Monroe plays a secretary whose walk is more 
memorable than her typing, is the last of the screwball classics, Haver said. 
More recent comedies, such as Peter Bogdanovich's "What's Up, Doc?" are too 
derivative to include. 
</P>
<P>
"Wacky" is one of the terms inevitably used to describe the screwball comedies. 
It is hard to think of a better word for a movie like "Bringing Up Baby" in 
which Cary Grant croons a love song to a leopard and wears a feather-trimmed 
negligee. 
</P>
<P>
The term screwball, film historian Sikov reports, was coined around 1930 by 
Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants to describe his most famous pitch. It moved 
in the opposite direction from a curve ball, leaving the batter wondering what 
had happened. The convoluted plots and breakneck speed of the screwball 
comedies sometimes leave audiences slightly dazed as well. "They are really 
pinwheels," Haver said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing Sacred" -- the title of one of the two films that opens the series 
Friday -- could serve as a two-word summary of the form. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that makes these things still so wonderful," Haver said, "is their 
irreverence -- toward pomposity, institutions, money, fame." Among the favorite 
targets: big business, rural America, tabloid journalism, the pretensions of 
the rich and especially marriage. 
</P>
<P>
While the surface of screwball is inevitably comic, the view of the world 
reflected in the films is often cynical, even jaundiced, Haver said, which 
makes many of them more palatable to contemporary audiences than sentimental 
movies of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The tart quality of screwball extends even to romance. However much in love 
they declare themselves to be at the fade-out, screwball couples are invariably 
making war, not love. As Haver explained, screwball was born the same year as 
the establishment of the Production Code, which filled the bedrooms of the 
movies with unrumpled twin beds. "Overt sex was banned," he said. "What 
replaced it was the battle of the sexes." ("In the world of screwball comedy," 
Sikov writes, "there is one primary axiom: Hatred is no reason to give up on a 
relationship. Just because two people seem to despise each other doesn't mean 
they're not in love.") 
</P>
<P>
The code led to movies in which Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn bicker and 
banter and skewer and squawk with the kind of intensity that is associated in 
the real world with more conventional coupling. As Haver put it: "They flirt 
with it, they talk about it, but they never actually do it." 
</P>
<P>
A perfect example of the form's preoccupation with, but oblique approach to 
sex, is Preston Sturges' "The Palm Beach Story," where the forbidden activity 
is termed "topic A." Not surprisingly, infidelity, especially infidelity that 
never actually occurred, is a favorite theme. In spite of the fact that the 
couples must keep both feet on the floor at all times, or perhaps because of 
it, films such as "The Lady Eve" are considered among Hollywood's most erotic. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haver, one of the reasons the movies hold up so well is their 
liberated attitude toward women. As played by Ginger Rogers, Carole Lombard, 
Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne and other "stalwarts of screwball" as Haver 
calls them, the women in these movies "were always equals, if not at the 
beginning by the end." 
</P>
<P>
Although the form is full of madcap heiresses, it also features boss ladies and 
other independent women. Among the most notable examples is "His Girl Friday," 
the rewrite of "The Front Page" in which star reporter Hildy Johnson, played by 
Rosalind Russell, is every bit as smart and cynical as the male reporter of the 
same name in the original. Professional women often fared better in such films, 
Haver said, than they do in contemporary movies such as 1988's "Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Although many notable directors, including Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, Ernst 
Lubitsch and Preston Sturges, are associated with screwball, Haver sees these 
films as far more than expressions of a director's vision. "The director is one 
element in the success of these films," he said, "and it's arguable whether he 
is the most important element." Haver pointed out that one of the best films, 
"Theodora Goes Wild," was directed by Richard Boleslawski, still a virtual 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Screwball also owes much to writers such as Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and 
to actors who could do silly things with dignity and deftness. Even the Art 
Deco sets and swanky costumes contribute to the success of screwball. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "My Man Godfrey," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" and other well-known 
examples, the program will include such rarely screened films as the original 
"Front Page," "Nothing Sacred" -- one of the first Technicolor movies -- and 
"It's Love I'm After" with Bette Davis. "You never associate Bette Davis with 
screwball comedy," Haver noted. "They manage to loosen her up a little, but she 
never loses her stridency." 
</P>
<P>
 The program starts Friday with screenings of "The Awful Truth" and "Nothing 
Sacred" at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. "It Happened One Night" and "Twentieth 
Century" will be shown Saturday, beginning at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent films will be screened on Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays (see 
Sunday Calendar for upcoming films). The program will close Saturday, March 3, 
with a seven-movie screwball marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 All screenings will be held in the museum's Leo S. Bing Theater. Most weekend 
screenings are $6 general admission, $3.50 for seniors. Wednesday matinees are 
$1 for the general public, 50 cents for seniors. Tickets for the screwball 
marathon are $12, $7 for seniors.

MIFFED OVER TAX, FIRM TO DESERT BEVERLY HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: AN AIRCRAFT-LEASING COMPANY ANNOUNCES IT WILL MOVE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY 
TO LOS ANGELES, WHERE ITS BUSINESS TAX WOULD BE MUCH LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the city of Beverly Hills over 
its business-license tax bill, one of the world's largest aircraft-leasing 
companies announced this week that it will leave its home of 15 years and 
relocate a few blocks away in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to our shareholders to move if the tax code makes staying here much 
more expensive," said Lou Gonda, executive vice president of International 
Lease Finance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Gonda's company, which got a modest start in Beverly Hills in 1973, generated 
more than $200 million in revenues in 1988 by leasing large commercial aircraft 
to airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gonda: "We lease all over the world. We just happened to have our office 
in the city of Beverly Hills, but it could be in Fiji. They (Beverly Hills) 
want to put us in the (tax) classification of a car-leasing company that has a 
showroom on Wilshire Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's attorney, Barbara Brown, said the vast majority of the firm's planes 
don't even fly in the United States, and that state law prohibits cities from 
taxing corporations on revenues that come from outside their jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said they were loath to create a precedent by amending the 
tax code, but they acknowledged that the nature of the firm's business was 
unique in the city. They instructed Finance Director Donald J. Oblander and 
City Atty. Greg Stepanicich to study whether accommodations could be made. 
Ultimately, they authorized a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oblander, Beverly Hills originally estimated the firm's 1990 tax 
liability, under the current code, at $400,000, based on gross receipts. When 
the City Council later considered a revision of the municipal code, the revised 
tax estimate was less than $150,000. But the corporation said it would be 
willing to pay no more than $88,000, said Oblander, the amount it calculated it 
would owe under Los Angeles tax codes. 
</P>
<P>
When Stepanicich reported to the council Tuesday afternoon that the company had 
rejected the compromise proposal, Mayor Max Salter said, "If it's not worth it 
to these people to be in this city -- where police response time is three 
minutes, where we have well-taken-care-of trees and beautiful sidewalks -- they 
should seriously restudy their position." 
</P>
<P>
The other Council members concurred that no further compromise would be sought. 
</P>
<P>
Notified by The Times of the Council's reaction, Gonda said, "Who cares? The 
city of Beverly Hills is attractive and so on. All the principals of the 
company are longtime residents of Beverly Hills. But when you look out (the 
office window), you see the exact same thing that you see from a block and a 
half away in Los Angeles. In fact, you see less here, because of the (building) 
height restriction. We can't justify staying here to our stockholders, because 
of fast fire trucks and pretty trees." 
</P>
<P>
He said the firm had looked into leasing a 23rd-floor office at 6500 Wilshire 
Blvd. and a 37th-floor office in Century City, both with superior views. Its 
current headquarters is in the Great Western building at Wilshire and La 
Cienega boulevards.

<P>
BOARD RESCINDS RENT RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Rent Control Board last week rescinded a rule that 
automatically allowed rent increases if the board failed to act on a landlord's 
rent increase petition within 120 days of filing. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Wayne Bauer said that the rule -- which was adopted a decade ago 
when rent control was adopted -- was too drastic, and that it created undue 
stress on staff and the board to process petitions quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Rent board administrator Mary Ann Yurkonis, who said the deadline was missed 
only once or twice in the last 10 years, said the deadline also forced the 
board to often deny continuances for tenants who needed more time to present 
their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords have criticized the decision, saying it will allow the board to drag 
out processing petitions.

<P>
POLICE WILL HELP JUVENILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Police Department will be taking a small group of juveniles 
under its wing in a pilot counseling program designed to steer them away from 
gangs, drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by the City Council on Monday, the program will offer tutoring, 
counseling, leadership training and sports to eight to 10 youths between the 
ages of 14 and 17, said Capt. Lars Sederling. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers will also go on a outdoor expedition with Outward Bound, which 
works with urban youths on building their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department will work with the Human Services Department and Culver 
City High School to sponsor activities and find volunteer tutors, Sederling 
said. "We're going to exclude hard-core gang members, hard-core addicts, people 
we're pretty sure can't change." 
</P>
<P>
The program will operate for six to eight months on $14,500 in Police 
Department funds derived from seized cash, cars and other property. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $500 from the department's seized-asset funds will go to a 
continuing city project to install deadbolt and window locks at homes of senior 
citizens, Sederling said.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY; 
</P>
<P>
HOTEL TAX HIKE OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to boost the hotel room tax from 10% to 12% in unincorporated areas of 
Los Angeles County was opposed Wednesday by a Marina del Rey hotel owner and 
local chamber of commerce officials who warned that the increase would be bad 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham M. Lurie, president of a partnership that owns the Marina Beach, Marina 
del Rey and Marina International hotels, told a county Small Craft Harbor 
Commission meeting that a portion of the hotel tax revenue should be used to 
promote tourism at the marina. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of promotion has hurt occupancy at his hotels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie told the commissioners that his two largest marina hotels continue to 
suffer substantial losses. He urged the commission, an advisory group to the 
Board of Supervisors, to support state legislation to create a pilot program 
that would divert some hotel tax revenues to marina tourism. Lurie argued that 
filling more hotel rooms would generate additional funds for the county from 
hotels, restaurants and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
After Lurie's testimony, the commissioners delayed action for one month on a 
recommendation to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors recently approved the 20% increase in the transient occupancy 
tax, but final action was postponed until Wednesday's public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase would bring the county hotel tax to the 12% level charged by 
the surrounding cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Culver City. It would 
generate an estimated additional $300,000 a year for the county.

LEARNING MATERIALS DONATED TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting on the premise that greater literacy is a key to fighting juvenile crime 
and lowering school dropout rates, a Westside group is providing dictionaries, 
books and other learning materials to Pacific Palisades elementary and high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastside-Westside Concerned Citizens Committee donated 43 Spanish-English 
dictionaries and 15 hand-held "Speak 'N' Spell" computers to Pacific Palisades 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Terri Arnold said the equipment will be used to set up learning 
centers for the school's 120 limited-English speaking students, most of whom 
are bused in every day from Central City neighborhoods where there is no 
classroom space for them. 
</P>
<P>
The school recently added two bilingual teachers to work with an increasing 
number of students who speak little or no English, "but we just haven't 
sufficient resources to meet the needs of the large numbers of children we're 
getting," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Cota, 61, who heads the Eastside-Westside group, said supplies are 
desperately needed by teachers who don't have the resources to deal with the 
students whose command of English is limited or nonexistent.

</P>
<P>
A nice list of credits, especially for an oversized doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-foot-tall, 20-ton steel and cement treat balanced atop Randy's Donuts on 
West Manchester Boulevard dates back to the days of programmatic architecture 
-- a style that proliferated in the 1950s and included giant chili bowls, milk 
bottles, tamales, ice cream buckets -- and even a coffee cup and a pumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
The three-dimensional billboards were devised to catch the eye and whet the 
appetite of passing motorists, said Teresa Grimes, preservation officer with 
the Los Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
In the non-consumable category, there was a florist shop in the form of a 
flower pot, a shoe repair shop masquerading as a shoe, a music school as an 
accordion and a camera store as a camera. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have the doughnut on the roof, we'd be just another doughnut 
shop," said Ron Weintraub, who runs Randy's Donuts with his brother Larry. 
</P>
<P>
But changing times threaten to gobble up Randy's, a fate that has already 
descended on a number of the area's other roadside wonders. 
</P>
<P>
The Weintraub brothers own the shop under the doughnut, but they rent the land 
it sits on. City redevelopment officials have targeted this prime property over 
the past decade for projects such as an office complex, a hotel and, most 
recently, a Cadillac dealership. All the plans have fallen through, giving the 
shop one reprieve after another. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Way, Inglewood's acting redevelopment director, said no plans for the lot 
have come forward since negotiations with Jim Lynch Cadillac broke down in 
November. She said the city may consider moving the doughnut shop to another 
location within the city if new plans emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy's Donuts is a fine example of a type of architecture that is fairly 
unique to Los Angeles," said Grimes, who traced the pop style back to the 
1930s. "At one point there were many Randy's Donut shops, but over the years 
they've been demolished." 
</P>
<P>
A few other giant doughnuts remain atop shops in Gardena, Los Angeles and Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the history of the community," Ron Weintraub said. "Everyone who 
stops at the traffic light (on Manchester Boulevard) just stares at it. Kids 
are pointing at it right now as I look out the window." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub is eyeing state or federal landmark status for the shop, but 
preservation officials are not optimistic that even that would protect the 
giant doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
If the shop were to be demolished, Randy's fans say it would leave a giant hole 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"It breaks my heart to see these places go down," said Pat Hinz, a sculptor 
from the Palos Verdes Peninsula who is planning to capture the shop in clay. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Conyers, a member of the Historical Society of Centinela Valley, added: 
"We all care about the doughnut. . . . It's a local thing we like to see in the 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that Randy's was Salvador Dali's favorite L.A. landmark. 
</P>
<P>
And Weintraub says the doughnut has also served as a landmark of another kind. 
A pilot once told him he uses the doughnut as a guide when he descends into Los 
Angeles International Airport.

ANOTHER VOTE AGAINST TAYLOR RANCH SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds' ultimatum that we must accept 
Taylor Ranch as the site for the new CSU campus, I say No! Taylor Ranch is a 
lousy location from a geographic standpoint. Why put a university at the 
northern tip of the easternmost city in the county? Reynolds claims that "80% 
to 90% of the students come from a 25- or 30-mile radius, and with Taylor Ranch 
as its center, what do you get? A circle with half its area in the Pacific 
Ocean and another fourth in the uninhabited coastal range north of Ventura! Not 
exactly in the center of the county, chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Now draw a straight line from the Taylor Ranch to the Ventura-Los Angeles 
County line in Thousand Oaks. Measure this line and you'll find that it's 
almost 40 miles long. Almost all 700,000 county residents live west of the 
ranch site. I just can't understand the chancellor's logic at all. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said, "the people here are very concerned about . . . smog." 
Obviously, she doesn't share our concerns. At a time when Ventura County is 
already the third smoggiest county in the state, I'm incredulous that a state 
official would tacitly condone a 25- or 30-mile one-way commute to college as 
acceptable. Round trip, that's 50 to 60 miles a day, 250 to 300 miles a week, 
1,000 to 1,200 miles a month of commuting per student! Multiply that by the 
eventual 15,000 students the chancellor envisions, and you have a major new 
source of smog. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take much imagination to see what another 15,000 students converging 
on the Taylor Ranch every day will do to air quality on the Oxnard Plain. 
Laughably, the chancellor threw us a bone and said, "we could have a very 
interesting program here on environmental management. . . ." Indeed. Perhaps 
she should be one of its first students.

COLLEGE PRESIDENT FAVORS TAYLOR RANCH UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an educator for the past 33 years (27 at Ventura College), I strongly 
support the development of a CSU campus on the Taylor Ranch property. I am 
writing this letter as a citizen of this county and as the Ventura College 
president, but not representing a college or district position. 
</P>
<P>
The development of a CSU campus is a higher education opportunity for the 
region, rather than just for the city of Ventura. The CSU campus will influence 
the lives and expand the educational opportunities for all Ventura County 
citizens, especially those residing west and north of the Conejo Grade and 
particularly those who do not have the resources or the time to commute or 
relocate to another four-year college campus in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the Legislature passed and the governor signed AB1725. Among other 
items, this important reform bill re-established the mission of the community 
college, with transfer education being the No. 1 priority. A university in 
close physical proximity to a community college is essential to carry out this 
mission. If offers the opportunity for thousands of students who work and 
attend college to compete and complete baccalaureate requirements. The vast 
majority of people currently attending the overcrowded CSU University Center on 
Alessandro Drive are former community college students, and most of these are 
working women. 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds supports the purchase of additional property in 
order to provide a wilderness area for wildlife that may or may not be affected 
by a college on the Taylor Ranch site. This should help allay the fears of 
those concerned with the destruction of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The global world that we live in cannot and should not be ignored. I urge all 
citizens to speak out and support the Taylor Ranch proposal now. We in Ventura 
County send more than $600 million in taxes to Sacramento annually and get less 
than $1 million in return for higher education beyond the community college 
level. Currently more than 4,000 students are commuting outside the county to 
take higher education classes. Ventura County is the largest county in the 
state of California without a CSU campus. The future is now!

SMITH REJOINS THE BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homer Smith, who twice previously was hired as offensive coordinator at UCLA 
after losing seasons, will return for a third tenure, football Coach Terry 
Donahue announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith will be asked to resurrect a Bruin offense that ranked ninth in the 
Pacific 10 Conference last season, when UCLA's 3-7-1 record was its worst in 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In only their second losing season in 14 under Donahue, the Bruins accumulated 
their lowest rushing yardage total since 1964 and their lowest passing yardage 
total since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bret Johnson didn't lead a second-half touchdown drive in UCLA's 
last seven games, five of them losses, and the Bruins didn't get a 100-yard 
rushing game from any of their running backs for the first time since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this is a very positive step toward regaining the stature our program 
enjoyed throughout the '80s," Donahue said in a statement released by UCLA. 
"Homer is an outstanding strategist and a fine teacher of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, also quoted in the release: "I'm grateful to Terry Donahue and UCLA 
for the opportunity and the challenge. Some of my happiest memories in coaching 
are from my years at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of football's most brilliant offensive coaches, Smith, 58, was 
first hired at UCLA by former coach Pepper Rodgers after the 1971 season. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, 2-7-1 in his first season with the Bruins, was 17-5 in the next two 
with Smith as his offensive coordinator. UCLA averaged 471 total yards a game 
in 1973, establishing a school record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue first hired Smith after the 1979 team was 5-6, and UCLA then enjoyed 
the most successful run in its history. With Smith serving as offensive 
coordinator, the Bruins won Rose Bowl games after the 1982, '83 and '85 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, though, was hired away after the 1986 season by the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the last two seasons at Alabama, where last fall junior quarterback 
Gary Hollingsworth established several school records and the Crimson Tide was 
10-2, reaching the Sugar Bowl, where it lost to Miami, 33-25. 
</P>
<P>
Smith made himself available to UCLA, he told reporters in Alabama, because he 
didn't like the way former Alabama Coach Bill Curry handled his move this week 
to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Smith will be missed in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
After Curry announced Sunday that he was resigning, Crimson Tide center Roger 
Schultz told the Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald: "We're going over to Coach 
Smith's house to kidnap him and beat on him until he agrees to stay." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, though, Smith was already in Los Angeles with Donahue, who told a 
reporter last month that Smith was "more capable of getting the most out of a 
football player than anyone I've ever been around." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Smith nor Donahue was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's hiring was greeted with excitement by UCLA players. 
</P>
<P>
"There's probably 250 days until our next game, but as of right now, everybody 
seems pretty fired up to get things turned around," said Jim Bonds, expected to 
be involved in a three-way fight for the starting quarterback position this 
spring with Johnson and freshman Tommy Maddox. "A lot of hope has been restored 
now that Homer's coming. He's going to help our recruiting and our attitudes 
because of the success he's had." 
</P>
<P>
Said tight end Rick Daly: "Everyone is really happy about it. Talk is, we're 
going to the Rose Bowl next year." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who will coach the Bruin quarterbacks, replaces Greg Robinson, who 
served as offensive coordinator for one season after spending most of his 
coaching career as a defensive coach. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Robinson was named assistant head coach, assigned to rebuild the 
Bruin defense. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA quarterback Rick Neuheisel, who coached the Bruin quarterbacks the 
last two seasons, will be reassigned to wide receivers.

JIM MURRAY: BEFORE WRITING HIM OFF, REMEMBER WHAT HE DID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of people are professing outrage over the notion of the upcoming George 
Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight. Words like Hoax! Farce! Travesty! Insult to the 
intelligence! surface. 
</P>
<P>
OK. Don't go see it. But before you let your indignation run away with you, let 
me tell you a little something about George Foreman first. Before you make up 
your mind. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw George Foreman, he was standing in the middle of a 
boxing ring in Mexico City waving and kissing a tiny American flag he carried 
in his massive fists. He had just defeated a mastodonic Soviet heavyweight to 
win the Olympic gold medal, but nothing personal. He brought a bouquet of red 
roses to give to the fallen foe. 
</P>
<P>
Believe me, the United States could use the victory that night. Oh, not for the 
medal count. We had won plenty of those in Mexico in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It was the psychological lift my country 'tis of thee sweet land of liberty 
got. The country was in a long losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
We were the guys in the black hats in those rocky years. Fighting for a 
principle in Vietnam, we were under heavy attack from Jane Fonda, to say 
nothing of students in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Olympic Games, some of our finest athletes took to the victory 
stands to make a statement against racism in America. Tommie Smith and John 
Carlos raised black-gloved fists at our national anthem; Lee Evans, Larry James 
and Ron Freeman showed up in black berets at the medal ceremony -- and though 
they took them off for the raising of the flag, the message was clear: America 
the Beautiful was being held up to the world as a lynch mob. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed tame enough, given the provocation. A black sociologist at San Jose 
State had even proposed a total boycott of the Games to remind America of 
broken promises. The trouble was, it sent a message to some very nasty 
characters that the Olympics were a great place to make a political statement, 
as they were to prove bloodily four years later at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
So, the actions of George Foreman were a beacon to the beleaguered U.S. Olympic 
Committee, the first ray of light for a group that had been portrayed as a 
congress of Simon Legrees before the assembled world press. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a black athlete who didn't want to burn down the White House. In fact, 
he got invited there a few days later by Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be an American," George Foreman told the press. "I don't have no 
disrespect for the flag." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC could have kissed him. The rest of the team felt good about itself for 
a change. He stalled some of the negative publicity in the foreign press. 
Indeed, in the American press. George Foreman was nobody's Uncle Tom. He had 
been there. He started life as this tough street kid, school dropout and pool 
hall thug. He didn't blame the world. "Nobody made me do it," he was to say. 
"Nobody could make me do anything. That was the trouble. Nobody made me put the 
bottles of wine to my lips. Nobody made me break 200 straight windows once. It 
was my own idea. Nobody made me drop out of school in the ninth grade. They 
would have educated me if I let them." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's life turned around one day when he put down the pool cue to watch a 
TV commercial for the Job Corps. "They weren't offering no miracles, just a 
chance to learn a skill, to quit messing around with your life," Foreman 
recalls. "I was ready." His mother, working as a cook and a waitress, was about 
at the end of her rope. And George seemed to be headed for the end of his rope, 
too. One with a noose in it. 
</P>
<P>
The Job Corps bailed out George Foreman. He got off the mean streets of 
Houston's Fifth Ward and into the work ethic world of Camp Vannoy in Grants 
Pass, Ore. "The only four-letter word I didn't know was w-o-r-k, " Foreman 
admits now. "I found out the American system is run on hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman became heavyweight champion of the world. He was strangely miscast for 
the role. In spite of the massive chest, the python-like arms, the left jab 
that looked like a telephone pole with a glove on it, there was a gentleness 
about George Foreman that defied pugilistic custom. It wasn't that he lacked 
the killer instinct, it was just that, well, he was the kind of guy who would 
bring roses to the guy he was going to knock out. 
</P>
<P>
When he lost the title, fight fans were surprised he became a parson. For 
Foreman, it was a calling. He later fought an in-and-outer named Jimmy Young 
and lost -- because he was seeing a vision. "I saw myself and I was dead," 
Foreman recalls. "It was just as clear, and I saw Jesus and he was bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's ministry in Houston concentrated on the young George Foremans he 
still saw on the streets around him. But he had a fatal flaw as an evangelist: 
He hated to beg for money. "I went on a show back in Georgia, and the reverend 
made a pitch for money, and I was embarrassed. I decided to go get my own 
money; I didn't want to be ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
So, George Foreman made a comeback. He has knocked over 19 palookas since then. 
He is hoping for an eventual shot at Mike Tyson. But first, there's Gerry 
Cooney, whom he fights in Atlantic City, N.J., next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
So, he's fat and 40. So, Cooney hasn't had a fight in three years and hasn't 
won one in four. So, he can't fight. 
</P>
<P>
So, Foreman needs the money. Why knock it? Nobody's holding a gun at our heads 
to go see it. On the other hand, why not? 
</P>
<P>
So far as George Foreman is concerned, look at it this way: We owe him one.

OWNERS UNVEIL REVENUE-SHARING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TEAM OFFICIALS ALSO SCHEDULE A MEETING FOR FEB. 9 TO CONSIDER SPRING 
TRAINING LOCKOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With baseball's owners scheduled to meet Feb. 9 to decide on a spring training 
lockout, their Player Relations Committee presented an outline of its 
revenue-sharing concept to representatives of the Major League Players Assn. 
during collective-bargaining talks Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at eliminating arbitration for players with zero to six years of service 
and protecting clubs in smaller markets, the revenue-sharing plan calls for all 
salaries of players in the zero-to-six category to be shared equally by the 26 
clubs and for those salaries to be determined by performance statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The union was aware of that basic framework but had also been interested in 
learning how the committee would define revenue and how much of that revenue 
would be shared with the players on a salary basis. 
</P>
<P>
While neither side would confirm it, the PRC plan apparently calls for 48% of 
the owners' gate and media (TV-radio) income to be shared with the players on a 
salary basis. 
</P>
<P>
"They are excluding concessions, parking, licensing and a number of other 
income sources," Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said by phone at the 
end of Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"What they are talking about sharing is substantially less than their entire 
revenues, no matter how you define it." 
</P>
<P>
And his reaction? 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he was reluctant to make a premature evaluation and response but that 
the union opposed any pay-for-performance system that did not account for a 
variety of intangibles, and would not turn back the clock by giving away 
already-held bargaining rights such as arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the union would accept the status quo, providing the new 
agreement contained assurances against collusion and improvements in pension 
and minimum salary, which the union is attempting to raise from $68,000 to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if there is a spring training lockout it will stem from the resolve of 
the owners to overhaul a system that is expected to produce an average salary 
in excess of $500,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the PRC instructed the clubs to put their spring training plans on 
hold until the owners meet in Chicago on Feb. 9, six days before camps are 
scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, acting head of the PRC, said Wednesday that the union has 
known for a year that the owners want an agreement before spring training. The 
aim, he said, is to avoid the pressures of a mid-season stoppage, by which time 
the players would have collected more than half their 1990 salaries while the 
clubs would still have 80% of their TV revenue -- stemming from postseason 
games -- at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we can cross all the t's and dot all the i's or even find all 
the t's and i's by Feb. 9," he said, "but surely we can reach an agreement that 
a change in direction is needed and then fill in the blanks during the season." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he was not surprised by the PRC memorandum because there has been 
speculation about a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
He said the imposition of a deadline was unfortunate in that it compounded a 
difficult process. 
</P>
<P>
"They took months to put together this radical proposal that we get for the 
first time today, and they're asking us to absorb it and reach an agreement 
within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unlikely it can be done that fast and that it would be terribly 
tragic to stage a lockout simply if there is no agreement on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"If their objective is to test the players, then they'll test them, and nothing 
I can say will prevent it, but I would suggest that it won't get them 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The next bargaining session isn't scheduled until Jan. 24. The clock is 
ticking. Fehr reflected and said of the owners: "We'll see if they're simply 
following a script or legitimately bargaining. It's too early to tell."

Bryant Gumbel, an avid golfer, has agreed to serve as the main host for 12 of 
the 19 golf tournaments NBC will televise this year. 
</P>
<P>
The new assignment is expected to have little effect on his role as the host of 
the "Today" show. Over a six-month period, he may miss only four days. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has named golfer Johnny Miller as its top analyst. He and Gumbel will work 
from the tower at the 18th hole.

Gumbel and Miller replace Vin Scully and Lee Trevino, NBC's main golf team 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Scully, choosing to spend more time at home, recently severed ties with the 
network since it has lost baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino left NBC to play on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Other newcomers to NBC's golf announcing team will be Joel Meyers, former UCLA 
radio announcer, and football commentator Bob Trumpy, who recently gave up his 
radio talk show in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers, hired as a pro football announcer last summer, this week was given a 
new multi-year contract calling for more extensive work. 
</P>
<P>
Terry O'Neil, the executive producer of NBC Sports, said: "Joel is one of the 
newcomers of the year in network television. Joel can certainly handle the 
diversity of different sports. He will have a key role in Barcelona (at the 
1992 Summer Olympics)." 
</P>
<P>
About the hiring of Miller, O'Neil said: "Johnny Miller was thoroughly -- and 
sometimes painfully -- candid as a player, about both his own game and the 
other tour players. He is absolutely independent. He's honest and contemporary 
and fully willing to speak his mind." 
</P>
<P>
NBC's first golf tournament of the year will be the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic 
at La Quinta next week. The early rounds, beginning Wednesday, will be 
televised on ESPN, but Gumbel will not be a part of those. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Jones will serve as the main host during the early-round cable coverage 
of NBC tournaments. Jones, who has been doing golf for NBC since 1965, will 
continue to work in one of the NBC towers during weekend coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wolfing will serve as a course reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel, who carries a 13 handicap, has been close to golf for years. Among 
other things, he is the host of an annual benefit golf tournament at Walt 
Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"For about 12 years, golf has been my passion and I play as often as I can," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gumbel wasn't a candidate for the job until last week. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, who is both the president of NBC Sports and the executive in 
charge of the "Today" show, had Gumbel in his office when he took a call from 
Scully. 
</P>
<P>
Scully had called to tell Ebersol he had decided not to accept an offer to stay 
and do golf. 
</P>
<P>
After Scully hung up, Gumbel said to Ebersol, "So who are you going to get to 
replace Scully?" 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said he didn't know, so Gumbel said, "Well, you haven't asked me." 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol jumped at the idea and was able to work out details with Gumbel's 
agent, Ed Hookstratten. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel did some fill-in golf work back in 1980 but hasn't done any since.

IT TOOK HIM A YEAR TO GET FEET WET; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: EVERETT-TO-ANDERSON HAS BECOME ONE OF THE NFL'S MOST EXPLOSIVE 
COMBINATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Henry Ellard seemed to hang in the air, twisting his body to snare a ball 
thrown behind him for a 26-yard gain that revived a third-quarter scoring 
drive. Then he made a textbook sideline catch, dragging the toes of both shoes 
across the sideline, for a first down on the Giant 14-yard line that set up the 
game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ellard had eight receptions during the Rams' victory over New York 
Sunday, at least two of them spectacular. He gained 125 yards and the Rams 
needed every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson found a gaping hole in a poorly executed zone defense and 
scored a touchdown right before halftime. Then he outran single coverage and 
scored the game-winning touchdown in overtime. Two catches. Fifty yards. 
Without them both, the Rams are on vacation this week. 
</P>
<P>
So guess who had the biggest crowd around his locker after the game? 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson, media superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have guessed? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not his grandmother, who nicknamed him Flipper as a baby because he 
sounded like a dolphin when he cried. And probably not Terry Donahue, the UCLA 
coach who didn't seem to have much regard for the long pass, even though he had 
Troy Aikman to throw it and Anderson to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
And certainly not anyone who saw Anderson on the street. He's listed at 6 feet 
but is probably about two inches shorter and can't weigh more than 175. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ram Coach John Robinson admitted recently that Anderson "came out of 
nowhere this year." 
</P>
<P>
This Flipper hit prime-time with a real splash, too. He's only in his second 
year in the NFL, but already has gained elite status. Don't bother Anderson 
with the down-and-dirty-across-the-middle stuff. He's strictly a home-run 
hitter. You know, a league-leading 26-yards-per-catch, 78-yard touchdown jaunts 
and seven touchdowns in only 48 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Just the game-breakers, please. 
</P>
<P>
Flipper set an NFL single-game record with 336 yards receiving against New 
Orleans. He stole the show and stole the ball as he raced through the end zone 
and up the tunnel out of Giants Stadium after his sideline streak meant sudden 
death for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Flipper is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
And it's even kind of hard to say that Anderson is playing in the shadow of Pro 
Bowl player Ellard when he has a battery of klieg lights shining in his face. 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons, though, for Anderson's flash to stardom. Some are quite 
logical. And one is a little mystical. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME, RIGHT TEAM 
</P>
<P>
When Aaron Cox, teammate and best friend, pulled a hamstring in training camp, 
Anderson was elevated to a starting role. It's a spot he has never 
relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate that Aaron was hurt, but that happens in football," 
Anderson said. "I got my opportunity and I never looked back." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Rams are a dream team for Anderson. He couldn't find a situation 
better suited to showcase his talents. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard is slicing through the hearts of defenses, routinely making incredible 
catches in clutch situations. Tight end Pete Holohan is a sure bet for at least 
10 yards if a team dares to cover him with a linebacker. And running back 
Robert Delpino is so proficient a pass catcher that the Rams use him as a wide 
receiver in some formations. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's quarterback Jim Everett, whose ability to put the ball in his 
receivers' hands has put the Rams in Sunday's NFC championship game in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The wealth of talented receivers means that Anderson is bound to face some 
man-to-man coverage. He is blessed with great speed and has good hands and he's 
going to get open some times. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to a foot race, well, I'm going to win most of those," 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
When he does, Everett often completes his end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
It's really pretty simple. 
</P>
<P>
"It all works because of the entire passing package," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say Anderson's success is merely a result of good fortune. He 
has discovered that a little dedication can add up to a lot of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he was a rookie who had trouble concentrating during practice. He 
spent more time thinking about running between car dealerships and clothing 
stores than running pass routes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of rookies probably go through something like that," Anderson 
said. "You know, you go through college having no money at all, then you have 
all these big checks coming in. You think about what you're going to do after 
practice because you have a lot of free time on your hands. I think that became 
a factor last year. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never doubted my talents. I just had to apply myself." 
</P>
<P>
So, after the season, Anderson decided to adopt a Spartan mind-set about the 
business of playing football. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Aaron worked out three times a week during the off-season, running and 
lifting weights," he said. "I took it upon myself to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
And when training camp started, he started paying closer attention in meetings 
and film sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing an interview with Flipper on TV a couple of weeks back and 
he was talking about a two-deep zone," Everett said. "I can't imagine him 
saying anything like that last year." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has been impressed with this sudden infusion of maturity. It seems 
that Anderson has made the transition from slightly flaky rookie to role model 
in just one season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Flipper's done can be a real catalyst for the other young players 
on this team," Robinson said. "He's learned what it takes to make it. He didn't 
know his first year, but this year, he's learned to work and his talent has 
been unleashed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAYBE IT'S MAGIC 
</P>
<P>
Even Robinson will admit that there's something less tangible than X's and O's 
involved here. Some things you can't draw on a chalkboard. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at any of the big-time combinations, like say (Joe) Montana to 
(Jerry) Rice, you see the same kind of uncanny rapport between thrower and 
catcher," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
With all that's going on out there, how does Jim Everett know just when to lob 
a bomb out there for Flipper to sprint under? 
</P>
<P>
Everett says it's more a matter of positive thinking and confidence than 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trust," Everett said, smiling. "I just know that everything I throw to 
Flipper, he's going to catch." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Anderson about it and you get that same Cheshire Cat grin. Two guys sharing 
a secret. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a confidence thing," he said. "Being in the same situations, week in 
and week out, you just know you can go up and make the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a basketball player who gets hot and everything he puts up goes in. 
If Jim throws it up, I just feel like there's no way I won't come down with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Everett-to-Anderson has developed into a potent weapon in the Ram arsenal and 
the playbook has undergone some revisions as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of deep routes in our system now and (offensive coordinator 
Ernie) Zampese has a lot of confidence in our ability to throw the ball down 
the field," Anderson said. "We do that better than a lot of teams in the NFL 
and we take pride in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I only get a couple balls thrown at me a game and they're both probably going 
to be deep. So I've got to make the most out of them." 
</P>
<P>
He has done that often enough to force some opponents to reconsider their 
defensive schemes. "If you're going to blitz us, you're going to probably get 
hurt," Robinson said. "Philadelphia talked about what they were going to do us 
and every time they blitzed, they rang up points on the scoreboard for us. The 
Giants tried it just a couple of times and paid a big price both times." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has made a difference on this team. But then he's used to being an 
impact player. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'OOOOH, I COULD THROW' 
</P>
<P>
Willie (Flipper) Anderson was a quarterback in Pop Warner League football and a 
quarterback for three years at Paulsboro High School in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
He played receiver as a junior and realized his chances of continuing his 
football career would be greatly improved if he concentrated on catching 
footballs, not throwing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Just coming up, you know, they usually have the best athlete playing 
quarterback and I was always a pretty good athlete," Anderson said. "My junior 
year, I played receiver, but then my senior year, I was thrust back into the 
quarterback position. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no intentions of playing quarterback in college, but not because I 
wasn't good enough -- oooh, I could throw. . . . No, it was just that I wasn't 
big enough and I didn't feel like dealing with the pressures of playing 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, Anderson led the team in receiving both his junior and senior seasons. 
He had 44 catches for 851 yards and six touchdowns and was an honorable mention 
All-Pac-10 selection as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Anderson isn't one of those who believe the passing game was 
unfairly neglected at UCLA in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of weapons," he said. "We threw deep, but Gaston Green was being 
pushed for the Heisman and I don't think anyone knew how good Troy could be in 
the beginning of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who was drafted in the first round in 1988, is a fixture on the Ram 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
And second-round pick Flipper Anderson is a regular on Sunday night highlight 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have guessed?

REEVES BLASTS TAGLIABUE FOR A 'ROOKIE' MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves of the Denver Broncos criticized a decision by the NFL to 
allow the Cleveland Browns to arrive in Denver later than usual for Sunday's 
AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"They took advantage of a rookie commissioner (Paul Tagliabue)," Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
League rules require visiting teams to arrive at least 48 hours before a 
championship game, but the Browns sought and were granted a waiver from 
Tagliabue allowing them to arrive on Saturday, 24 hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland team physicians believe the Browns will be less bothered by Denver's 
mile-high altitude if they arrive only 24 hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to Cleveland three years ago, we had to get in there two days 
early," Reeves said. "Part of the reason was media accessibility, even though 
the only Broncos at a Friday press conference were me and one player. 
</P>
<P>
"Traveling on Friday is definitely disruptive. It's a disadvantage. You 
practice at home before you leave. You have to meet at your hotel on Saturday. 
In Cleveland, our players couldn't sleep at night because their fans kept 
driving around our hotel, honking their horns. "It's disruptive having to go on 
the road, but that's the way it's supposed to be. That's why you play for the 
home-field advantage. I agree that the rule is antiquated. But to all of a 
sudden have it changed the week before the game is a mistake, in my opinion. I 
don't agree with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves continued to needle the Browns over their apparent preoccupation with 
Denver's thin air. 
</P>
<P>
"The altitude is going to be a factor whether they come in here 45 minutes 
before the game or 45 days before the game," he said. "They went to Albuquerque 
for a whole week one year. Another time they came here the day before. It 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of our crowd and the altitude, I think most people around the league 
would agree that we have the biggest home-field advantage of any team. The thin 
air does have an effect. Our record at home proves that." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to muzzle any ideas fans might have about starting up a Denver "dawg 
pound," officials say they plan to clamp down on rowdy people who throw objects 
during Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Fans caught tossing items on the field at Mile High Stadium during the AFC 
championship game will be arrested, and could lose rights to season tickets, 
officials say. In addition, security will be beefed up. 
</P>
<P>
During an Oct. 1 game in Cleveland when the Browns defeated the Broncos, 16-13, 
fans pelted players and officials with dog biscuits, eggs and even radio 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Tom Dooley had the Broncos switch ends of the field during the game to 
avoid the "Dawg Pound," after he was hit on the head with an AA battery. The 
"Dawg Pound" is the nickname given to the east end of the Browns' stadium where 
the rowdiest fans sit. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bud Carson dreams of having his Cleveland Browns run through the Denver 
defense the way the Pittsburgh Steelers did for half a game last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But he says it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't duplicate Pittsburgh's running game," Carson said. "There are a few 
things that they do that we also do with our running game, but we don't do them 
as well. We're a different team than they are."

49ERS WILL TRY TO ESTABLISH RUN -- REALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seeing the Giants run the ball successfully against the Rams last week has 
given the 49ers some ideas. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that 49er quarterback Joe Montana, the NFL's most proficient 
passer, will be restricted to handing the ball off, but Coach George Seifert 
said Wednesday that running back Roger Craig and fullback Tom Rathman will 
probably get to carry the ball more often than in San Francisco's 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something, sure, we have to do to have a chance to win the football 
game," Seifert said. "Most coaches say the same thing, but it's true. It's 
something that has been true the last few ballgames and something we really 
tried to focus on once we won our division. 
</P>
<P>
"In our games against Buffalo and Chicago we really concentrated on running the 
ball more and we did (in practice) in the week prior to our last playoff game. 
And I think it paid off in our last ballgame and it's something we have to do 
in this ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had 162 yards rushing last Sunday in their 41-13 rout of the Vikings, 
led by Craig's 18 carries for 125 yards and a touchdown. Rathman had seven 
carries for 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams yielded 171 yards rushing to the Giants in their 19-13 overtime 
victory at the Meadowlands and were fifth in the NFL in rushing defense during 
the regular season.

49er nose tackle Michael Carter, who has been on injured reserve since Oct. 29 
because of a sprained right foot, will probably be activated for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors plan to turn him loose, though he's in some pain," Seifert said. 
"Defensive lineman is probably one of the positions you can come back quickest, 
especially as a pass rusher, which is probably how we'd use him." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Matt Millen, the former Raider, said he's not surprised to see the 
Rams advance this far in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that impresses me most about them is that they can score from 
anywhere," said Millen, who considered signing with the Rams as a free agent 
but instead went with the 49ers. "If you look at one team in the NFL that's 
getting better and better each week, it's the Los Angeles Rams. Earlier on, 
they were doing things they weren't quite sure of, but now (quarterback Jim) 
Everett knows his receivers and they have an experienced offensive line. 
They've gotten better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Millen said he doesn't plan to be taken by surprise Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been on my heels and I never plan to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been asking the 49ers if Everett is a young Joe Montana -- 
Seifert compared him with Dan Fouts for his "sense and feel for the attack" -- 
and the 49ers have been generous in their praise. But although Everett may be a 
budding Montana, the original is no slouch. 
</P>
<P>
"The most impressive thing about him is, he's so accurate," Rathman said. 
"He'll make a tough throw and it'll be easy to catch. He'll make it with 
pinpoint accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Pierce Holt agreed that Everett is up and coming, but Montana 
is already there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams have just gotten better and better. Look at them now," he said. "And 
look at Everett: He had some problems, but he knows now where his guys are 
going to be and they just turn around and the ball is there. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got it down to a science (and) he's got a great offensive line in front 
of him. . . . The thing about Joe is that he's played so well in big games. We 
have to see how Jim does in big games." 
</P>
<P>
49er tight end Jamie Williams has a unique way of preparing for games: reading 
comic books. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who dresses in a Spiderman costume for off-season appearances before 
children's groups, chooses the comic according to the nature of the pending 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Conan is really the one I get into when I have to get down and dirty," he 
said. "Spiderman is my overall psych." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difference in the scores, Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur 
doesn't think the Rams' 13-12 victory in San Francisco and the 49ers' 30-27 win 
at Anaheim were different types of games. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people looked at the two games as completely different from a 
defensive point of view, but I didn't," he said at Rams Park. "If you take the 
two big slants (John Taylor's touchdowns of 92 and 95 yards) out of there, I 
don't think you'd call (the second) a wide-open game. 
</P>
<P>
"We knocked them out when they were inside the 20 with interceptions early in 
the ballgame. And the first time, we made them kick field goals four times." 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur says the Ram defensive players are confident they can contain the 49ers 
because they have done just that for all but a couple of plays in the last two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Those slants, well, that was unique," he said. "I know they've done that to a 
lot of people, but normally you'd like to think you could get the guy on the 
ground before he gets 90-some yards out of a six-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great deal of respect for 49ers, but, in the past, we were all a 
little nervous about playing them. Now we look at it as a tremendous challenge, 
but with a feeling that we can play with them. And that's a good feeling.

THREE WORLD CUP SOCCER TEAMS TO PLAY IN TOURNAMENT AT COLISEUM 
</P>

Three World Cup soccer teams will play in the Marlboro Cup of Los Angeles, Feb. 
20 and 22, at the Coliseum, but the United States will not be among them. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, Colombia and Costa Rica will join a Mexican club, Chivas of 
Guadalajara, in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, one of 24 teams to qualify for the World Cup finals this 
summer in Italy, will not play in Los Angeles because it already has an 
exhibition game scheduled against the Soviets Feb. 24 at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"'We're trying to expose our players to as many quality games as possible, 
sure, but we also want to expose them to as many different styles as possible," 
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said. "There's so few games we're going to be able to 
play. To play one team twice within a week, I don't think that serves our 
purposes in developing a team." 
</P>
<P>
Gigi Vera, manager of Marlboro's soccer operations, said the United States 
would agree to play in Los Angeles only if it was guaranteed that it would not 
face the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to help them out, but we didn't want to change our format 
for one team," she said. "That wouldn't be fair to the other teams." 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 20 games will match the Soviets against Colombia and Chivas against 
Costa Rica. The losers will play for third place and the winners for the 
championship on Feb. 22. RANDY HARVEY

Media mogul Ted Turner and five other former America's Cup skippers have asked 
New York's highest court to rule against the San Diego Yacht Club, which won 
the sailing race with a catamaran. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and the other skippers filed papers with the New York Court of Appeals, 
asking to join a friend-of-the-court brief filed last month by seven other 
former skippers. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments in a challenge brought by New Zealand's Mercury Bay Yacht Club, which 
lost the 1988 race, are scheduled for next month. Under century-old rules, the 
court is the final arbiter of disputes over the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the catamaran captained by Dennis Conner for the San Diego Yacht 
Club, which successfully defended the America's Cup in 1988. The challengers in 
that race, the Mercury Bay Yacht Club of New Zealand, have argued that the 
vessel gave the Americans an unfair advantage and should have been 
disqualified. Several yacht clubs have also come out in support of the New 
Zealand club.

All-American linebacker Keith McCants said the Alabama coaching change would 
not affect his decision on whether to skip his senior season and enter the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reports that the 6-foot-5, 256-pound McCants will turn professional, 
possibly becoming the No. 1 choice in the draft, he would not say if he will 
give up his final year of collegiate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not announced that I am coming out for the draft," he said. "I'm still 
a junior and I'm registered at the University of Alabama for the second 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
McCants said his eventual announcement would have "nothing to do with Coach 
Curry."

Murad Muhammad filed a lawsuit against fellow boxing promoter Don King, asking 
in excess of $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stems from heavyweight champion Mike Tyson's proposed fight against 
Canadian Razor Ruddock last November in Edmonton, Canada. Tyson pulled out 
because of illness. Muhammad handles Ruddock's fights. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who now is scheduled to fight Buster Douglas on Feb. 12 in Tokyo, is not 
named in the suit. Douglas' fights also are promoted by King. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks not only damages, but an injunction against King promoting Tyson 
fights until Ruddock has a title shot. The injunction would begin after the 
Tyson-Douglas fight.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SISTER CITIES FUNDS SPENT PROPERLY, 
AUDITORS FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $55,000 in public funds granted to a Sister Cities program overseen 
by Juanita St. John were properly spent, despite some contract and accounting 
irregularities, Los Angeles city auditors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The money, approved by the City Council under two contracts, was intended to 
help fund a July, 1986, international conference of city representatives at 
Universal City, according to an audit released by City Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The audit was ordered in part because St. John, a business associate of Mayor 
Tom Bradley, is the focus of a criminal probe of possible misuse of funds in an 
Africa trade task force. Auditors found the city's contract with the Sister 
Cities group was vague, poorly monitored by the city clerk and some provisions 
were violated, but that the money was appropriately expended.

UNEMPLOYED MAN, 21, SEIZED IN SERIES OF RAPES IN NORWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives have arrested a 21-year-old unemployed man in connection 
with a string of rapes and break-ins that have unnerved neighbors in a 
four-square-block area of Norwalk for the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
David Ross of Norwalk was arrested at 4 a.m. Tuesday while walking along 
Seaforth Avenue in one of the areas hardest hit by the attacker, said Sgt. 
Matthew McDannel. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ross was arrested on suspicion of committing rape and burglary, McDannel 
said detectives had not charged him yet Wednesday. "We are still 
investigating," McDannel said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the attacks began last July, the Sheriff's Department has intensified 
patrols in the area, using squad cars, dogs and helicopters. Residents who said 
they were frightened by the string of three rapes and 10 break-ins invested in 
security systems, left their porch and patio lights on at night and spoke of 
forming a Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
McDannel said that Ross lives nearby and generally fits the description that 
victims and other witnesses have given police, although he was not carrying any 
weapon or mask. He was spotted by a passing patrol car as he peered through a 
fence into a resident's yard, McDannel said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives have held at least two neighborhood meetings to warn residents that 
the rapist apparently watches a house for days to determine what time the 
victim will be alone. During each assault, he has worn some type of mask and 
has been armed with a gun.

CAMPAIGN RACIAL OVERTONES RAISED IN COUNTY REMAPPING SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: BURKE TELLS HOW HER PHOTO WAS USED IN DANA LITERATURE. SCHOOL 
BUSING WAS ALSO AN ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Called to testify about racial overtones in political campaigns, Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, the only black to serve on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, told a federal judge Wednesday that her 1980 campaign opponent 
included her photo on his campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, who lost to Deane Dana in 1980, was called by the plaintiffs in a 
lawsuit that alleges that the county's 1981 redistricting plan discriminates 
against Latinos in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Among the 
factors that can be considered for determining whether there is a violation is 
evidence of racial appeals in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, appointed to the board in 1979 by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to 
represent a predominantly white district, said Dana also made mandatory busing 
of school children a major issue in the campaign, even though it was a matter 
over which the supervisors had no control. 
</P>
<P>
A former congresswoman and state assemblywoman, she testified that only once 
before had her picture appeared in the literature of an opponent, that of a 
leader of the John Birch Society. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Burke, who is now practicing law, said: "I never 
charged racism, and I am not charging it now," adding that it was up to the 
judge to draw conclusions. But ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum contended that 
Dana's campaign "appealed to racial sentiments." He pointed out that Dana's 
mailer containing Burke's picture was never sent to predominantly black 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smith, manager of Dana's 1980 campaign, testified that he used Burke's 
picture in campaign literature in a comparison of the candidates' positions. 
"In any other campaign, I would have used the opponent's picture even more," he 
said. "We tried to be careful to stay away from racial issues." 
</P>
<P>
Smith pointed out that Burke spent $1 million on television commercials during 
her unsuccessful 1978 campaign for state attorney general. "Our polling showed 
that over 90% of voters knew she was a black woman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith acknowledged that busing was not a county issue. "This was not a campaign 
over how to widen a street. It was a philosophical campaign between a liberal 
and a conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn testified for less than 10 minutes Wednesday as opposed 
to Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who spent 4 1/2 hours on the stand Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn could not recall the discussions leading up to the 1981 remapping. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, however, told U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon that he has made 16 
failed bids over the last eight years to win the supervisors' approval for 
enlarging the board from five to seven members "to give better representation" 
to blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for one supervisor to represent more than 1 million people," 
Hahn said. He noted that the county population, which was about 4 million, when 
he was first elected to the board in 1952, now totals about 9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Education Fund, have asked the court to consider expanding 
the county board by an unspecified number. The U.S. Justice Department, also a 
plaintiff, is seeking to create a predominantly Latino district, from which a 
Latino would stand an improved chance of winning a seat on the board.

$25-MILLION WEST L.A. FIRE CALLED ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Fire Department said Wednesday that arson was the cause of a 
fire that spread from a condominium construction site to an exclusive 
neighborhood in West Los Angeles on Dec. 23, causing at least $25 million in 
damage and forcing 150 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've eliminated all possible reasons for an accidental cause of the fire," 
Battalion Chief Lon Purcell said of the fire at the Devonhill Condominiums, 
which began at about 3:30 a.m. Purcell said he could not discuss the evidence 
found at the site of the fire at the intersection of Devon Avenue and Wilshire 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But a source familiar with the investigation, who asked not to be identified, 
said investigators smelled gasoline at the site of the blaze in the partially 
completed condominium project. The source also said witness statements after 
the fire were consistent with a fire fed by a large quantity of fuel spread 
over the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said they heard an explosion, while others reported a loud 
"whoosh." When they looked outside, they said, the flames already were reaching 
the top of the four-story structure, which is consistent with a fire that was 
intentionally set, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Whipped by Santa Ana winds, the fire hopscotched along Wilshire Boulevard and 
into nearby neighborhoods, damaging 15 buildings. Although the initial 
assessment of the damage was placed at $25 million, Fire Department officials 
said the figure could go as high as $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Purcell said the department has identified no suspects and the source said the 
department does not even have strong suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
There was a security guard on duty the night of the fire, but he said he saw 
nothing and passed a lie detector test, the source said. The source said, 
however, there was "significant opposition" to the building in the surrounding 
area, although he did not say what that opposition was based upon. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the source said, "there had been a lot of labor problems" at the job 
site. Some workers had been laid off recently, according to the source. That 
contrasted with the public statements of construction officials at the site, 
who said they knew of no labor trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The source said the Fire Department learned that the fire was suspicious early 
in the investigation, but delayed announcing the cause. Fire officials were 
cautious because of criticism the department received for its handling of two 
other high-profile fires, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
In both fires -- a $22-million blaze at the Los Angeles Public Library and one 
that destroyed the historic Pan Pacific Auditorium -- suspects were arrested 
and then released for insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The department felt unfairly treated in those incidents, claiming that in the 
case of the Pan Pacific fire it had been pressured by the mayor's office to 
announce the confession of a man whose attorney later said would "confess to 
killing President Roosevelt if you asked him."

JUDGE RULES KOREAN CHURCH, NOT PRESBYTERY, OWNS PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling in a lengthy and bitter dispute between the nation's oldest 
Korean-American church and its governing religious body, a Los Angeles judge 
said that church property claimed by both parties belongs to the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow, in a decision released Wednesday, ruled that 
the Korean United Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles is the owner of the 
buildings and grounds in the 1300 block of Jefferson Boulevard where the 
congregation has gathered for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
During trial, lawyers for the Korean church and the defendant, the Presbytery 
of the Pacific -- a 23,000-member nonprofit corporation that handles financial 
and judiciary matters in 56 Presbyterian churches in Los Angeles -- said an 
appeal would likely follow, regardless of which side won the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Counsel for the Presbytery, which has 60 days to file an appeal, could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute that led to the lawsuit began in 1986, when arguments within the 
congregation began to disrupt church activities, the court decision states. As 
a result, the Rev. Sang Bon Woo, pastor of the Korean church, was stripped by 
the Presbytery of his position as head of the congregation's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
The deposed minister decided to leave the Presbytery and took most of the 
congregation with him. 
</P>
<P>
The Presbytery labeled the minister a renegade and required that his 
congregation turn over the church property to a Presbytery-approved Korean 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the issue of whether the Presbytery has the ability to 
determine who is the rightful congregation has finally been addressed by the 
court," said Edward Masry, lawyer for the Korean church, which was founded in 
1903 by former sugar cane workers from Hawaii who were among the first Koreans 
to settle in the United States. "We hope that the Presbytery will not carry the 
case any further and will allow the Korean church to worship as it pleases." 
</P>
<P>
Although officials of the Presbytery conceded that the property and buildings, 
valued at $3 million, were paid for or were in the process of being paid for by 
the congregation, Presbytery lawyers argued that an early church deed, signed 
in 1937 and bearing the name of the Presbytery, was proof of longstanding 
understanding of who owned the property. 
</P>
<P>
"The properties of individual churches have always been understood to be held 
in trust for the denomination," Robert Long, attorney for the Presbytery, said 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The policy is written in the governing body's constitution or Book of Order and 
is commonly practiced by all member congregations, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the (Korean church) ever agree to hold its property in trust for the 
Presbytery . . .? Clearly the answer is no," Morrow wrote. ". . . The bylaws 
and articles and the declarations in the Book of Order are nothing more than 
expressions of present intention. . . . They do not create an express trust." 
</P>
<P>
The Presbyterian Church U.S.A. Inc. -- of which the Presbytery is a member -- 
has been involved in court disputes with several seceding churches across the 
nation. Decisions in those cases have been conflicting. In some instances 
property has been awarded to the congregation; in others, property has gone to 
the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.

IRATE KILLER SLAIN BY BYSTANDER, POLICE BELIEVE

<P>
A mechanic who had just been fired sprayed an auto repair shop with gunfire 
Wednesday, wounding his boss and the boss's wife and killing a customer before 
a bystander shot him to death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings occurred shortly before 3 p.m. after Alfonso Alonzo Romero, the 
owner of El Gato Repair Shop at 1706 W. 1st St., fired the mechanic, Santa Ana 
Police Lt. Robert Helton said. Romero then asked the mechanic to return his 
uniform, Helton said, and that's when the mechanic pulled out a 9-millimeter 
pistol and began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators are not certain what happened next, they believe that a 
bystander picked up a gun from the body of the dead customer and fired at the 
mechanic, hitting him in the head. The mechanic was later pronounced dead at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange. Neither the mechanic nor the slain customer was 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The bystander then ran from the repair shop and drove off in a 1981 yellow 
Toyota pickup truck. He was last seen heading north on Walnut Street, police 
said. A witness, however, said that she saw two men run from the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"This person on the premises saw the gun, grabbed it and then shot the suspect. 
We don't consider him a suspect right now. He is, however, a major material 
witness," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they do not know what the bystander did with the gun as he 
fled from the auto repair shop. He could face possible charges, but for now he 
is only wanted for questioning, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several witnesses said they heard as many as seven shots, police said 
they do not know how many were fired. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a whole lot of shots fired. We can't make an exact count yet," 
Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators late Wednesday were interviewing witnesses and trying to piece 
together the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, 30, was apparently the first to be shot. He was taken to UCI Medical 
Center, where he was listed in critical condition with head and chest wounds. 
He underwent surgery late Wednesday.

El Gato Repair is in a small outdoor mall that includes three other auto repair 
shops and an upholstery store. Several witnesses were either at El Gato or at 
the other stores in the mall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven witnesses were being questioned by the police Wednesday evening.

Tillie Flores, who lives on Walnut Street, said she saw not one but two men run 
from the mall after the shootings. One man ran north and the other, who police 
believe was the bystander who killed the suspect, jumped into a Toyota truck 
and sped off.

"They looked terrified. They did not look like they wanted to be around at 
all," Flores said.

DEUKMEJIAN SAYS O.C. FREEWAY PROJECT, OTHERS FACE CUTS IF GAS TAX FAILS

Without the passage of a gas tax increase this year, Gov. George Deukmejian 
warned Wednesday, the state's transportation program will have to absorb $533 
million in budget cuts that would force a moratorium in new highway 
construction until July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in the awarding of new construction contracts would postpone 
completion of such showcase transportation projects as Los Angeles County's 
Century Freeway and the Harbor Freeway transitway, as well as the widening of 
the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A $52-million state contribution toward Los Angeles' Metro Rail would also be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
But some lawmakers accused Deukmejian of tailoring the transportation cuts so 
that vote-rich areas of the state would feel the cuts the most and be more 
inclined to endorse the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the governor is very Machiavellian in cutting Metro Rail as a way to 
get people in Los Angeles to vote" for the gas tax proposal, said Assembly 
Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
The governor, who is leading a campaign to win voter approval of a 
9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase in June, painted the bleak picture of 
California's transportation future in his final budget proposal to the 
Legislature. It was the first time his Administration presented a definitive 
outline of the effect the failure of the gas tax increase would have on the 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
For the state Department of Transportation to live within its finances, 
Deukmejian said, many major programs would have to be either reduced or 
eliminated, a hiring freeze would have to be instituted and new equipment 
purchases would be severely curtailed. He said none of the cutbacks would be 
necessary if the tax increase is endorsed by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Decision day is coming," said state Transportation Director Robert Best. "The 
budget for this coming year shows that we do not have enough revenue to meet 
our needs and underscores the importance of a long-term solution like" the gas 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials in Sacramento listed possible cutbacks if the gasoline tax 
is not approved, Caltrans officials in Orange County said they have not been 
told which projects will be delayed here. Most, however, guessed that a portion 
of the Santa Ana Freeway widening project between the Santa Ana Freeway and the 
Costa Mesa Freeway will have to be postponed another year. Work is already 
under way on one segment and several interchanges as part of the $1.6-billion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the county may have been lucky this time around, because 
the cuts would affect mainly new projects that would have begun construction 
next fiscal year -- a year when new construction on highway projects in Orange 
County is supposed to go into a temporary hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the governor spoke, however, a series of projects to be constructed 
after 1991 had been put on hold, including the $45.4-million final phase of the 
Santa Ana Freeway-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange reconstruction, $35 million in 
state funds for the new Interstate 5-Corona del Mar Freeway tollway interchange 
in San Juan Capistrano, and the $62.6-million widening of the Santa Ana Freeway 
from 4th Street to Santiago Creek in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, without passage of SCA-1 (the proposed gas tax increase) in June, 
Caltrans will become a rehab and maintenance organization and there will be no 
new construction," said former Orange County supervisor Bruce Nestande, a Costa 
Mesa development firm executive who is vice chairman of the California 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad to see this happen," Nestande added, "because it simply means that 
the highway system is going to slow down and there will be no relief." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian suggested that Caltrans could save $102 million by eliminating all 
construction projects paid for entirely by state funds, $120 million by 
discontinuing the department's use of private engineers, $64 million by 
withholding funds earmarked for mass transit -- including $52 million for Los 
Angeles' Metro Rail project -- $58 million by hiring and equipment cutbacks and 
$65 million by delaying new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The programs that would remain intact under his proposal include seismic 
retrofitting of bridges, litter collection -- a pet project with the Republican 
governor -- and maintenance of highways. But even while highway maintenance 
funds would not be cut, Deukmejian noted that there would be no increases "to 
handle added inventory on the system or to reduce maintenance backlogs." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the programs slated for financial surgery are supported either 
entirely or in part by the state's beleaguered 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. 
For years officials have complained that the gas tax, one of the lowest in the 
nation, has not produced enough revenue for the transportation system to keep 
pace with inflation and the state's phenomenal growth in population. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Deukmejian and the Legislature proposed doubling the tax but 
determined that the increase would not go into effect unless voters approved a 
constitutional amendment modifying the state's spending limitation next June. 
The tax increase -- which cannot go into effect unless voters approve a 
constitutional amendment in June to modify the state's spending limit -- would 
help pay for an $18.5-billion program designed to expand the highway system, 
ease congestion, construct mass transit facilities and catch up on projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the gas tax increase proposal has been attacked by several powerful 
interest groups including teachers and developers, and the prospects for its 
passage are in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the governor's budget is realistically grim," said Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). "If (the gas tax) 
does not pass there will not be enough money to both maintain roads and expand 
the system. It will delay projects which will mean increasing congestion . . . 
and the nightmare continues." 
</P>
<P>
Both legislators and Caltrans officials saw the new construction moratorium as 
having the most severe impact on California's transportation system. State 
Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said it "really translates into a deferral of 
$350 million worth of projects" because of lost federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
"This really translates into a deferral of $350 million worth of projects 
because most of these are 20% state money, 80% federal or 10% state money, 90% 
federal," state Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said.

SCHOOL ROLLS GROW BY 3%; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ETHNIC MINORITIES ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE INCREASE. OFFICIALS ARE 
SCRAMBLING TO OBTAIN MORE MONEY AND BILINGUAL TEACHERS TO MEET THE CHALLENGE.

Driven by a substantial increase in the number of ethnic minorities, enrollment 
in Orange County's public schools jumped 3% this school year, continuing a 
steady, decade-long climb that is testing the ability of the school system to 
meet new and growing demands. 
</P>
<P>
Educational administrators say that the increasing number of students forces 
them to seek additional state funds for the development of more school sites 
and also requires more bilingual teachers in the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly isn't a bilingual teacher in Orange County out of work," said 
Vergil Hettick, director of research and evaluation for the Santa Ana Unified 
School District. "We are strongly encouraging all of our teachers to go back 
and learn other languages to meet these demands." According to the Orange 
County Department of Education, total enrollment in Orange County grew to 
360,000 this school year from 350,000 in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
The education department's figures, released this week, show that minority 
groups make up 45% of the student population, compared to 41% last year. There 
are now about 12% more Latino students in the county than last year, along with 
6% more Asians, 6% more Filipinos and 6% more blacks. White student enrollment 
decreased 3%, or 5,725 fewer students. 
</P>
<P>
School districts in Santa Ana, Westminster and Garden Grove experienced the 
greatest enrollment increases. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase of minority students is certainly a mirrored reflection of what's 
happening throughout the county," said William Gayk, senior analyst with the 
county administrative office. "The minority population has had a steady growth 
pattern for years in this area and is continuing to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gayk said, white families are moving to San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties in pursuit of affordable homes at the same time that the birthrate 
among whites is declining. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1981, about 19,000 of 33,000 births were white. In 1988, only 20,000 out of 
42,000 births were white," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to adapt to shifting demographics and a multitude of cultures, 
Santa Ana Unified, the county's largest school district, is offering $1,000 
incentives to teachers who receive bilingual credentials. Though the district 
also has the highest percentage of nonwhite students, ethnic minorities make up 
only 25% of the teaching staff, Hettick said. 
</P>
<P>
"In every way possible, we are asking teachers to help and offering them 
reasons to do so," Hettick said. "We are even sending recruiters out to most of 
the local colleges to seek out minority teaching students and also to encourage 
everyone at that point to learn another language." 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate its student overflow, Garden Grove Unified School District has 
added portable classrooms to several of its campuses and is considering 
reopening schools that were closed in recent years because of a decline in 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are now getting is the overflow of the increased population from the 
Santa Ana district," said Alan Trudell, public information officer for the 
district. "Right now, after a long decline in enrollment, we are bursting at 
the seams with students, particularly at the elementary level." School 
administrators also express hope that this most recent increase in students 
will encourage the state to allocate much-needed funds for the building of 
additional schools. 
</P>
<P>
"At any one time, we are in the process of planning the development of more 
schools," Hettick said. "But you have to have the kids to show for it and we 
certainly do."

PLANNERS APPROVE SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Over neighborhood protests, the Planning Commission approved plans Tuesday for 
a 20-acre shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour public hearing, the commission voted 3-1 to allow the 
Mission Viejo Co. to build 158,150 square feet of retail and office space, a 
six-screen cinema and restaurant on Santa Margarita Parkway near Los Alisos 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The completion date for the proposed Trabuco Hills Shopping Center is February, 
1991, said Wayne Peterson, director of planning for the developer. The Mission 
Viejo Co. also plans to build a medical office building, retail shops, an auto 
service center and a gas station on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Although seemingly resigned to the overall project, about 25 residents in the 
heavily residential section of northeast Mission Viejo, at the base of the 
Saddleback mountains, protested the plans to build the cinema within 300 feet 
of a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
With Trabuco Hills High School on nearby Cordova Road, homeowners said students 
would loiter near the theater, causing problems and making noise. "This is too 
close to the high school," said Gerry Matsukane, a board member of the 
Evergreen Ridge Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
While most people will use the cinema "just a few nights a year," she said, 
"our homeowners are going to be bothered every night of the year." 
</P>
<P>
But the harshest criticism of the cinema was leveled by Planning Commission 
Chairman Craig Galbraith, the lone vote against the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be fights," he said. "There will be drug deals going on back there. 
There's no doubt of that." 
</P>
<P>
But the panel's majority sided with the judgment of the County Sheriff's 
Department, which saw no problem policing the area. "As far as unsavory 
characters hanging out at movie theaters," Sheriff's Lt. George Johnson said 
Wednesday, "that's not our experience here in South Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
At least one security guard will patrol the shopping center, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Several area residents spoke in favor of the cinemas. Young Lee, who lives 
about half a mile from the site, said the theaters would be a family center. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see a happy hour there, a family happy hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The center would be the second shopping center in the area. Portola Plaza, a 
21-acre collection of retail stores, is across Santa Margarita Parkway from the 
proposed center. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the works for the area is a football stadium at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center has also been criticized by the Saddleback Area 
Coordinating Council, a citizen's committee sponsored by the county that 
reviews development issues in Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic keeps getting worse and worse as time goes on," said coordinating 
council member Jim Thor. FRANK MESSINA

KENNEY WON'T RUN TO KEEP COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Dan Kenney announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection 
in November. Kenney, who was first elected in 1981, said he had never planned 
to serve more than two terms, which are four years each. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the council eight years," Kenney said. "I'm announcing now 
because this is the time of year when a lot of people decide whether they are 
going to run." 
</P>
<P>
Kenney, a director of pharmacy services for two hospitals in the county, was 
mayor twice, in 1984 and 1986. He was reelected in 1985 on a campaign pledge to 
improve parking, fight offshore oil drilling and oppose the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor toll road. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to remain active in civic affairs.

TWO HELD IN SALE OF PHONY COCAINE

<P>
Two men were arrested Tuesday in San Clemente for allegedly trying to sell 
drywall disguised as $2.5 million worth of cocaine to undercover police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects Arcesop Espbar-Benitez, 31, of Sherman Oaks and Nestor Martinez, 36, 
of Downey had been tracked for a month by police from San Clemente and El Monte 
and federal Drug Enforcement Administration officials from San Diego, San 
Clemente Sgt. Richard Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to fool undercover officers, who had arranged to buy 150 
kilograms of cocaine from the suspects, drywall boards were cut into 
10-by-6-inch blocks and dusted with small amounts of cocaine, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
The men packed the drywall, which resembles hard-packed chalk, into the trunk 
of a new black Mercedes-Benz and met undercover officers at a coin-operated car 
wash on South El Camino Real, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone went to a lot of trouble to cut this up and wrap it in brown, stamped 
paper and everything," said a DEA agent on the case who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine if you would have been fronting $2.5 million to buy this stuff," said 
Downing, who added that the price charged was the "going rate" for that amount 
of cocaine. He could not estimate its street value. 
</P>
<P>
"If they would have tried this switch with underworld drug dealers, they 
probably wouldn't have lived," Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were first arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine, then 
confessed to officers that the substance was phony, police said. They then were 
arrested on suspicion of "sale of a substance in lieu of a controlled 
substance." 
</P>
<P>
The men had sold cocaine to undercover officers in previous deals made during 
the investigation, police said. WENDY PAULSON

JUDGE WON'T BLOCK CAMPAIGN TRANSFERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Wednesday refused to grant state Senate candidate Ron 
Isles' request to block his two main opponents in the 31st District race from 
using more than $21,000 in campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Judge W.F. Rylaarsdam rejected Isles' argument that Assemblymen Gil Ferguson 
and Frank Hill violated a campaign law when they transferred money from their 
Assembly war chests to their Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Hill (R-Whittier) moved more than $20,000 from his Assembly campaign account in 
December; Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) transferred $1,000 of Assembly funds to 
his Senate campaign the month before. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawmakers said they received approval from Fair Political Practices 
Commission officials before moving any funds. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' attorney contended that the transfers violated two sections of 
Proposition 73, a campaign reform measure approved by state voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Shandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the FPPC, said Wednesday that there is a 
clause in the measure that requires candidates to use only campaign funds 
gathered specifically for that race. 
</P>
<P>
However, a federal court order in Sacramento allowed candidates to move 
campaign funds within their own control while a trial concerning the 
constitutionality of portions of Proposition 73 is in progress, Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Isles' attorney, Ed Haggerty, contended that Isles still had the 
right as a private citizen to challenge the legality of the funds transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rylaarsdam, without commenting on the case directly, rejected Isles' 
request for a temporary restraining order and set up another hearing for Jan. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
The two assemblymen and Isles, a Brea city councilman, are the main GOP 
candidates for the state Senate seat vacated by William Campbell (R-Hacienda 
Heights), who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
The primary in the heavily Republican district that stretches from West Covina 
to Laguna Beach will be Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's attorney, Roy Ogden, hailed the judge's decision and blasted Isles for 
"coming into court and using the judiciary for political motives." Ferguson was 
not represented by an attorney at the hearing. SHELBY GRAD

MARSHALS EXONERATE DEPUTY IN SCUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county marshal's office has exonerated a bailiff who was accused of 
manhandling a Vietnamese interpreter in a back hallway of the courthouse in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Marshal Richard H. Emmons, who is a bailiff to Superior Court Judge 
David O. Carter, was cleared of wrongdoing in an Oct. 17 scuffle with 
interpreter Jamie Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, 33, said she is considering filing a lawsuit against Emmons over the 
episode, which began when Emmons was escorting a prisoner through a private 
courthouse hallway used only by court personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said Emmons, 42, had come at her "like a mad dog" when she got in his 
way, twisting her arm behind her back and wrestling her to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons said that she had defied his orders to move aside and that her conduct 
had endangered the security of the watch he was keeping on his prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons has been told by superiors not to discuss the incident or the 
investigation. A marshal's office spokesman said it is department policy not to 
release the results of internal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the outcome confirmed that Emmons has been exonerated 
of wrongdoing.

NEW LANDING SYSTEM RUNNING AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new instrument landing system was switched on at John Wayne Airport on 
Wednesday, replacing equipment blown to bits by a jet blast more than three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new equipment makes landings safer in foul weather because it gives pilots 
altitude and descent rate information that is unavailable through the airport's 
other, less precise landing system, said Joe Fowler, chief of the Federal 
Aviation Administration's control tower at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up and running fine," Fowler said. "We're back to normal instrument 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
The new $225,000 system is unusual because it is on a raised platform at the 
runway threshold. It was raised above ground, officials said, to combat signal 
distortion caused by tall buildings nearby and to boost the signal's power. 
</P>
<P>
An engine blast from an America West Boeing 757 blew apart the small red and 
white shed that contained the old instrument landing system, delaying 30 to 40 
departing or arriving aircraft of various types for two hours the morning of 
Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said the pilot, who was testing an engine, had failed to 
follow proper procedures by revving the engine too soon, before he had taxied 
the aircraft to the blue line mark on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
However, airport officials acknowledged at the time of the incident that the 
pilot, who was verifying engine repairs, had permission from an unidentified 
air traffic controller. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot returned the airplane to the gate, and it left later on a routine 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said that the FAA's legal department is still 
reviewing the possibility of billing Phoenix-based America West for the new 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she said refinement of the system's use for northbound departures, which 
are used during Santa Ana wind conditions, is still under way. JEFFREY A.

Huntington Beach has been charged with eight counts of felony embezzlement in a 
double-dipping payoff scheme that siphoned off $10,000 in taxpayers' money, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond J. Orlando, 56, was arrested by Huntington Beach police at his Trotter 
Road home Tuesday evening, capping a five-month investigation into alleged 
fraud by city contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The probe was conducted by the special assignment unit of the Orange County 
district attorney's office, according to Police Lt. Ed McErlain. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was requested by City Administrator Paul Cook after evidence 
surfaced into "possible misuses of city employees and time, as well as theft of 
city property," McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charges, Orlando, who has been the town's building maintenance 
supervisor for 2 1/2 years, retained contractors to repair city-owned block 
walls damaged in traffic accidents, then submitted two bills -- one to the 
city, and another to automobile insurance companies -- for the same work. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said the double payments were made to the contractors between May and 
August, 1989, and that Orlando also arranged for contractors to be paid for 
work that was never done. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the contractors offered cash kickbacks to Orlando, but the 
charges allege that the contractors performed construction work on Orlando's 
home at no charge, McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said the investigation is continuing and further arrests are expected, 
although no other Huntington Beach city employees are expected to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando was arraigned Tuesday night and posted $10,000 bail, McErlain said. 
Reached by telephone at their home Wednesday, Orlando's wife, Vickie, said her 
husband had no comment.

SWEDISH RUNNER SAYS SHE'S HEADED FOR UCI

Maria Akraka, a three-time Swedish national champion and world-class 800-meter 
runner, said Wednesday she is planning to enroll at UC Irvine and compete for 
the Anteaters' track and cross-country teams. 
</P>
<P>
Akraka, 23, a junior transfer from Iowa State, moved to Irvine last Wednesday 
with her boyfriend, world-class hurdler Danny Harris, in hopes of attending UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who was a three-time NCAA intermediate hurdle champion at Iowa State, 
is competing for Nike International and will be training at UC Irvine's track. 
Harris is best-known for ending Edwin Moses' 10-year victory streak. 
</P>
<P>
Because UC Irvine already has used its women's track scholarships, Akraka must 
wait until other financial aid is worked out. Although the NCAA allows a 
university to offer as many as 16 scholarships for women's track and 
cross-country, Irvine offers three. 
</P>
<P>
Akraka attended Iowa State for two years, from January 1987 until February 
1989, competing for the Cyclones in indoor and outdoor track and one 
cross-country season. Her best time in the 800, 2 minutes 1.67 seconds, which 
she ran in August 1988 at Sweden, is more than two seconds faster than the 
winning time of the NCAA women's final last June. 
</P>
<P>
Because Iowa State Coach Dick Lee honored Akraka's request to be released from 
her scholarship last year, Akraka will have two years of eligibility remaining 
in track and three years in cross-country, NCAA spokesman Shane Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Akraka could be competing in an Anteater uniform as early as 
Feb. 17, the date of UC Irvine's home opener against UC San Diego and Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Akraka, whose mother is Swedish and father is Nigerian, said she left Iowa 
State because she wanted to see a different part of the United States. "I liked 
Iowa State," she said. "But I'd been there for two years. I wanted to 
experience another part of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Akraka, who was born in London but grew up in Stockholm, said she considered 
attending UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it, but I didn't want to stay in L.A.," she said. "I talked to 
(UCLA women's coach) Bob Kersee, but nothing really was worked out. He 
should've called me back, but he didn't. Anyway, I really like it here." 
</P>
<P>
Providing she does enroll at Irvine and is eligible to compete, Akraka would 
probably be the most talented athlete in the program's history. 
</P>
<P>
"If she's eligible for UCI, she should be a force to be reckoned with," said 
Jon Hendershott, editor of Track &amp; Field News. "She's definitely for real." 
</P>
<P>
Akraka placed seventh in the NCAA 800 final in 1987 and 1988, and is strong in 
cross-country as well. She placed 30th in the 1988 NCAA cross-country 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll (offer Irvine) immediate visibility, national prominence, and bring up 
the level of the other competitors who are here," said Danny Williams, UCI 
women's track and field coach.

JUDD IN SWIM OF THINGS AFTER ADJUSTING ATTITUDE

From Apathy to Ironman . . . The Brian Judd Story. 
</P>
<P>
 That title is not available at video rental stores, but maybe it should be. 
Brian Judd, UC Irvine swimmer and avid video cameraman, is full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Judd, a senior, came to Irvine after earning All-American honors at Fountain 
Valley High School. By his sophomore year, however, Judd was ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Judd trained primarily as a long-distance swimmer, putting in 
many hours and thousands of yards of distance training. When he came to Irvine, 
though, he found himself in a program based on shorter, quality workouts. 
</P>
<P>
This did not suit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a terrible freshman year," Judd said. "I had a bad attitude. I was 
whining all the time and it's impossible to get better when you have a bad 
attitude. I swam slower at (the Big West) conference finals than I did as a 
senior in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Judd realized he was slipping out of his championship form -- 
namely on the mental side -- he stopped swimming after the season ended, taking 
five months off. He joined a fraternity, moved in with a few of his "brothers" 
and allowed swimming to sink on his priority list. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having fun and making lots of new friends, but when the season started, 
I was so out of shape, it was a joke," Judd said. "We swam at the USC 
Invitational, and I had horrendous times. I didn't want to swim. I didn't want 
to be there. I just said to myself, 'What am I doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
That question, along with his poor performances, was enough to make Judd 
realize that he had to commit to swimming one way or another. After several 
days of self-evaluation, he decided to make swimming his top priority. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, his performances had improved significantly and he 
qualified for the U.S. senior nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Judd is a role model for his teammates. Last season, the Anteaters gave 
him the "Ironman award," honoring the swimmer with the best work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty drastic (turnaround)," Anteater Coach Charlie Schober said. 
"Brian just decided he was going to do it and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Judd said, it's not easy to remain motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll complain more than anyone before I get into the pool," he said. 
"Sometimes I'll start out saying, 'I'm not gonna work that hard, I'm not gonna 
work that hard,' then all of a sudden it's 'Gosh dang it! I'm gonna work hard.' 
As soon as I dive in, it's 'OK, let's go as hard as you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone really respects him," said senior swimmer Tim Hinchey, one of Judd's 
roommate. "When he swims he doesn't just do it, he does the best he can every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The hard work is paying off -- Judd has set school records in the 1,650-yard 
freestyle (15 minutes 45 seconds, this year) and the 500 free (4:27.94, last 
year). However, Judd said he'll consider his swimming career complete if he 
meets his top goal: qualifying for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships March 22-24 at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Judd considers his best event the 500 free, and his best time is nearly five 
seconds short of the NCAA qualifying mark of 4:23.04. However, Schober said 
Judd's chances are realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought his time down from 4:31 to 4:27 last year, so making (4:23.04) 
would be about the same measure of improvement," Schober said. 
</P>
<P>
If he does qualify, he would be only the second UCI swimmer to do so since the 
Anteater program gained Division I status in 1977. Brian Pajer, one of Judd's 
roommates, was an NCAA All-American last year and already has qualified for 
this year's NCAA championships in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
While Judd has recommitted himself to swimming, he hasn't stopped having fun 
out of the pool. He and Hinchey spend their extra time cruising their Irvine 
neighborhood making videotapes of anything that comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird, stupid stuff usually," Judd said. "But our idol is Chuck Henry 
(host of Channel 7's "Eye on L.A."). We want to be Chuck Henry." 
</P>
<P>
What Judd would most like to capture on film though is a race he has yet to 
swim. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my swim career have I had a race where you finish and, like you see 
in the Olympics, a guy finishes and just goes crazy because he's so happy he 
did so well," Judd said. "Just once, I want to have a race where I can feel 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The UCI men's tennis team is rated ninth in the Volvo collegiate rankings for 
the period of Jan. 9-March 6. . . . The middle distance track clinic, which 
will be hosted by UC Irvine Saturday, will feature several nationally known 
coaches, including Lance Harter of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Skip Stolley of 
the Southern California TAC. A $5 fee (doesn't include parking) is good for the 
entire day. "It's basically a freebie for coaches in the area," UCI Coach Vince 
O'Boyle said.

IRVINE CO. SIGNS PACTEL CELLULAR TO $65-MILLION LEASE 
</P>

<P>
The Irvine Co. said Tuesday it has signed a $65-million lease with PacTel 
Cellular for 10 floors of office space at its Jamboree Center office park next 
to the San Diego Freeway, the second most expensive lease ever signed in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The signing ends months of speculation in the local real estate industry about 
where PacTel would relocate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's largest cellular telephone companies, PacTel had been 
sought as a tenant by some of the county's biggest developers. It is thought to 
be the largest of a handful of big companies recently looking for office space 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Such tenants are eagerly sought by local landlords because office vacancy rates 
are high -- about 22% throughout the county -- and the large number of 
buildings available keeps rents down. 
</P>
<P>
PacTel, a subsidiary of San Francisco's Pacific Telesis Group, will move more 
than 500 employees from leased offices in Newport Beach and move its 
headquarters from elsewhere in Irvine to the new building, which is under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The lease -- signed Friday -- runs 10 years and covers more than 200,000 square 
feet of office space in 3 Park Plaza, one of three 20-story office buildings at 
Jamboree Center. 
</P>
<P>
The building is scheduled to open in August. PacTel will take the bottom 10 
floors, and the company's name will be displayed on the building. 
</P>
<P>
The only lease involving a larger sum in Orange County was another Irvine Co. 
deal, an agreement with computer products manufacturer Western Digital to take 
360,000 square feet in Irvine Spectrum, the Irvine Co.'s huge office and 
industrial park south of Jamboree Center. The Irvine Co. says that lease -- 
signed in 1988 -- is worth more than $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
The signing continues a remarkable run of big leases signed by the Irvine Co. 
recently at Jamboree Center, the developer's last big office park in the 
Newport Beach-North Irvine area. The company has no land in that area suitable 
for building another high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Los Angeles law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher signed a 
15-year lease for 111,000 square feet on five floors of the 20-story 4 Park 
Plaza. That lease is for about $60 million. Also under construction, 4 Park 
Plaza is scheduled to open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1988 the Geneva Cos., which specializes in mergers and acquisitions, 
leased 100,000 square feet on five floors at 5 Park Plaza for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
That means all three big office towers at Jamboree Center now have major 
tenants, although the Irvine Co. is rich enough to have built the three towers 
before having any large tenants signed up -- and indeed had planned to build 
them before these deals were signed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last few years, we've signed more than a quarter of a billion dollars 
in big leases," said Michael T. Lutton, an Irvine Co. vice president. "We've 
dominated the local office market." 
</P>
<P>
PacTel chose Jamboree Center because it needed a big building. PacTel expects 
to expand further. 
</P>
<P>
PacTel Cellular serves customers with car telephones. It recently concluded a 
large deal to provide service in West Germany, which will mean even more growth 
in its office staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The cellular industry is expected to be one of the super-growth businesses in 
the '90s," said a prepared statement from Jeffrey R. Hultman, president and 
chief executive officer of PacTel Cellular, "so we have an urgent need for 
facilities that will allow us to efficiently expand our operations during this 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
That was why an earlier deal between PacTel and Griffin/Related Properties of 
Santa Ana fell through, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Its Griffin Towers at the Hutton Centre office park in southern Santa Ana 
proved too small for PacTel's needs. One of the two 12-story towers was 
entirely leased, and the other was one-third leased when Griffin and PacTel 
were near a deal in August, said Roger N. Torriero, a principal at Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
But PacTel realized that the building did not leave it enough room to grow, 
Torriero said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good part was we were leasing up those buildings very quickly," Torriero 
said. "The bad part was we lost a big tenant." 
</P>
<P>
PacTel was then courted by some of the county's other big developers, brokers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s Lutton said he began talking to PacTel a little more than two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jamboree Center also includes two 12-story buildings and a 550-room Hilton 
hotel. It is not far from the booming office center near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The more lavish buildings a little farther away from the airport -- such as 
Jamboree Center -- have proven attractive to a lot of professional concerns, 
such as accounting and law firms, brokers said.

CALCOMP SELLS SUBSIDIARY TO BOOST JAPAN MARKET SHARE

CalComp Inc. said Wednesday it has sold a majority interest in its Japanese 
marketing subsidiary to two major Japanese corporations in order to increase 
sales of its computer graphics products in that country. 
</P>
<P>
William P. Conlin, CalComp president, said in an interview that the sale of 56% 
of Nippon CalComp to Nippon Steel Corp. and Sumitomo Corp. was the only way 
ensure that the company would gain access to the entire Japanese marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been satisfied with the growth rate of our subsidiary in Japan, which 
has been around 20% to 25% a year for the past few years," Conlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Conlin said CalComp doesn't do as well in the Japanese market as it does in 
other international markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of strong local competition in Japan, which is not true 
elsewhere, and in Japan you just don't get total access to the market if you 
are not a Japanese (owned) company. We wanted to have a subsidiary that was 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary, now called NS CalComp, had less than 5% of the estimated 
$750-million annual market for computer graphics equipment in Japan, Conlin 
said, while CalComp, with about $450 million in sales last year, has about 10% 
of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
CalComp, a Lockheed Corp. subsidiary, will realize a $20-million gain from the 
sale. Nippon Steel bought 51% of the marketing while Sumitomo's trading company 
subsidiary bought a 5% interest. 
</P>
<P>
NS CalComp will market, service and support CalComp's plotters, digitizers and 
graphic display products, which are used in a wide range of computer-aided 
design, presentation graphics and graphic arts applications. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the joint venture, new products designed specifically for the 
Japanese market will be developed jointly by CalComp and Nippon Steel's 
Electronics &amp; Information Systems Division, Conlin said.

<P>
Tony Guerrero owes his current career as promising young fluegelhornist to a 
grade-school teacher he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd do anything to get out of that class," the 23-year-old Santa Ana native 
relates. "One day the music teacher came in and asked if anybody wanted to 
start taking music lessons once a week. I joined right there." 
</P>
<P>
What followed was anything but promising. Guerrero asked to play drums but was 
assigned a set of bongos instead. He requested a switch to trombone, but was 
given a trumpet. No matter; it was two weeks before the young initiate learned 
the difference between the two instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all this seems far away as the accomplished, largely self-taught 
instrumentalist and composer releases his second recording, "Different Places," 
for Los Angeles-based Nova Records. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Brian Bromberg, who appears on the album and includes one of Guerrero's 
tunes on his own recent release, "Magic Rain," is a big fan of the 
fluegelhornist. "(Tony's) a decent human being who's also a great musician; 
dedicated, sincere. He's not the kind of person that's going to abuse his 
gifts. He's young, and if he sets high enough goals for himself and defines 
what he needs to do to get there, he'll become one of the leading voices on his 
instrument." 
</P>
<P>
The tunes on "Different Places," all but one written by Guerrero, range from 
funky backbeat numbers to cool, soothing ballads, graced by its leader's 
smooth, melodic fluegelhorn tones. One of the longer numbers, "Mangione," is an 
unabashed tribute to both the playing and compositional style of Guerrero's 
chief influence, fluegelhornist Chuck Mangione. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, it was his song 'Children of Sanchez' that got me started," he 
says. "I went out and got the album and started accumulating other Chuck 
Mangione albums. And I would listen to albums with people who worked with him. 
It was kind of like tunnel vision for a while; I just saw the Mangione thing. 
It was a long time before I got into be-bop and all the other possibilities of 
what jazz can be." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's musical path continued to be rocky after his first experiences. He 
took private trumpet lessons, but, he says, "I never practiced like I should 
have. There's a point in your childhood when you get really bored sitting there 
playing scales and just want to go out and learn how to play 'Proud Mary' or 
something. Needless to say, I made several trumpet teachers kind of mad." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's early musical tastes ran to Kiss and Led Zeppelin. During his 
freshman year at Saddleback High School, Guerrero's former music instructor 
from McFadden Middle School, Mark Takeuchi, enlisted Guerrero to help him 
establish a jazz band at Saddleback. Guerrero agreed, even though he wasn't 
exactly sure at the time what jazz was. Takeuchi introduced him to jazz 
generally and Chuck Mangione specifically. "(Takeuchi's) been a very 
inspirational guy to me," says Guerrero. "He really opened me up to what 
passions in music are." 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of the year, Takeuchi left Santa Ana to take a job in 
Watsonville. Guerrero was determined to keep the school's jazz band running. 
The school provided practice space but no money for buying music, according to 
the fluegelhornist. So he began to write out his own arrangements for the 
ensemble and now credits this experience with getting him started as a 
composer. Before long, Guerrero had formed his own band, and, minus his 
presence, the high-school jazz ensemble dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
It was also during high school that Guerrero began to favor the fluegelhorn. "I 
started getting into it and feeling the difference," he says. "I've never 
really pursued the lead or studio trumpet sound. I'd rather be known as 
something of a solo voice, and I think my voice is the fluegelhorn. It's a bit 
more conducive to melodic playing. The trumpet is such a bright, brash 
instrument comparatively. I still do occasional things on trumpet, but most of 
the horn work I do is on the fluegel." 
</P>
<P>
Along with a lot of straight-ahead jazz, Guerrero has lately been listening to 
the Gipsy Kings, whose sound, he says, fits his own attitudes towards music. 
"It's incredibly soulful and generally very simple. That's something I've 
always tried to gear my own music towards: simplicity, or the less-is-more 
thing. Their melodies are simple, their harmonics are simple, yet it's 
beautiful, beautiful music. There's a lot of emotion coming from them." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's band, featuring keyboardist Bill Cantos and saxophonist Gary Gould, 
now plays the occasional gig at Bon Appetit in Westwood and has appeared in 
concert at Cal State L.A., UCLA and Pepperdine College. On Sunday nights this 
month, he fronts a different group at Newport's Cafe Lido, where he plays 
ballads and jazz standards like "Let's Fall in Love" and Miles Davis' 
"Milestones" as well as his own compositions. 
</P>
<P>
The young fluegelhornist's goals in life are simple. "I'd love to be able to 
afford to raise a family by scoring for films, cutting my own albums, and doing 
concerts, kind of that Quincy Jones thing. I'd just like to make a living doing 
what I love." 
</P>
<P>
Does he, when looking back, think Orange County was a good place for a budding 
musician to be? 
</P>
<P>
"There's really nothing for musicians in this area, and there was little 
support from my school district for a jazz band. There's a couple of good 
colleges -- Orange Coast College has a good program -- and there's really only 
one decent jazz club now that Just Like Perry's (in Mission Viejo) has closed. 
There just doesn't seem to be a lot of support for jazz out here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony Guerrero Band plays Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at the Cafe Lido, 501 30th 
St., Newport Beach. Admission: free. Information: (714) 675-2968.

<P>
The hundred-pound-plus Rottweiler, jaws as big as a suitcase, strains at the 
end of his leash, whoofing and itching for a chance to attack. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ann Hill gives the command, and Sasko clamps his massive chops down on 
the protective leather sleeve held by trainer Brad Franz. After a few seconds 
of twisting and tugging, Hill calls her dog off, and Sasko is sweet as sugar. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my baby," says Hill, of Yorba Linda, the wife of former Los Angeles Rams' 
tight end David Hill. "I don't think (my husband would) have any other kind of 
dog. I just feel so safe." 
</P>
<P>
Safer, no doubt, than the ill-advised intruder who would invade the territory 
of Sasko, or any other well-trained guard dog -- such as Ashley, Jeannie 
Salazar's black German shepherd. Salazar, who lives in Santa Ana, took her dog 
to protection training classes for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in her breeding," Salazar said. "I can take her to the park, and she's 
great around the kids. But if anyone comes around the house, forget it. No one 
even comes up to the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Burglar alarms are cleaner and don't need feeding. Deadbolts are cheaper. But a 
dog -- particularly one schooled in protection -- remains one of the most 
effective methods of improving home security. 
</P>
<P>
"The presence of a dog in a back yard will keep intruders outside," said 
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. "They bark and make a racket. That will 
certainly deter someone from going back there." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Michael Gray, head of the Anaheim Police Department's community services 
bureau, says residents at neighborhood watch meetings often ask about the 
advisability of purchasing dogs to guard their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We recommend anything that would make a person feel more comfortable in their 
home, and more secure," Gray said. "There are ways to defeat a dog -- throw it 
meat and such -- but they're definitely a deterrent. . . . If you're going to 
have one, you ought to have it trained." 
</P>
<P>
An untrained dog can be either too vicious -- presenting both safety and 
liability problems -- or too passive, providing no real security, say police as 
well as dog trainers and breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have control over your dog, then you really won't have problems," said 
Tom Tackett, a trainer and breeder in Orange. "If the dog is not in control, if 
it's just plain mean, well, then you don't have much of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth agrees that a trained guard dog is better than simply a vicious one -- 
but even then, he has reservations about the presence of large, dangerous dogs 
in family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"There are numerous occurences in a residential neighborhoods, like when a kid 
kicks a ball over into your yard and he goes to retrieve it, where a guard dog 
might react differently from the average dog," Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Tackett, who runs his business out of his home, says he turns away more than 
half the dogs brought to him for protection training. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like to see in a dog is that they're very sociable, friendly and 
self-confident," Tackett said. "If he has those traits, we can train him." 
</P>
<P>
A "sharp" dog, on the other hand -- a dog that is quick to snap if startled, or 
one that shows its teeth and tries hard to look vicious -- is not a good 
guard-dog candidate, Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
"A dog that's sharp, quite often he's got some insecurities," he said. "He's 
putting up some kind of bluff." 
</P>
<P>
A stress test allows Tackett to quickly assess a dog's confidence and 
aggression levels. With the dog on a tether, the trainer slowly approaches him 
from the side, establishes eye contact, and then comes at the dog straight on, 
waving a bag or stick. 
</P>
<P>
Some dogs can't handle the stress and show extreme fear. Others raise their 
hackles and bare their teeth, hoping to scare the attacker. "The ideal dog is 
at the end of the cable, barking, tail up, muscles forward," Tackett said. 
"He's saying, 'OK, you want to fight? Great, let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then, the trainer drops the threat and quickly tries to befriend the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal dog can handle all of that," Tackett said. "Some freak out." 
</P>
<P>
Some breeds make better guard dogs than others. Rottweilers, German shepherds 
and Belgian Malinois -- an increasingly popular breed, particularly with law 
enforcement agencies -- are ideal for protection work, trainers agree. Hunting 
dogs, such as golden retrievers, are normally too friendly. "They're too 
passive, too easygoing," Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
Terriers, however, do "extremely well," he said. "They're small, but they don't 
think they are. . . . A dog 45 pounds and up can handle himself and take out a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
Dobermans, while menacing, are not the most reliable breed, and tend more than 
some others to bark unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Pit bulls? "We don't see them too often," said Tony Terrazas of K-9 Companions, 
which operates out of Yorba Linda and Riverside. "Their owners believe their 
dogs are aggressive as is. . . . What they've got is a gun without a safety." 
</P>
<P>
Mixed breeds sometimes turn out to be trainable, but if what you really want is 
a first-class, four-legged bodyguard, you should buy a dog that has been bred 
for that kind of work, Terrazas said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to put your money into it, you want a Cadillac," Terrazas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An untrained Rottweiler costs between $800 and $1,500, while a trained dog of 
that breed might sell for $2,500, according to Terrazas. German shepherds are 
somewhat less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs with champion bloodlines, however, cost much more. 
</P>
<P>
One of Tackett's Rottweilers -- 10 year-old Bruno von der Herzogslinde -- cost 
$10,000, while Arras Zur Spielmanns-Au, a former world champion and the 
grandfather of a recent litter of "Rotties" at Tackett's house -- all of which 
were sold before birth -- is worth about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
These dogs, and others with similar bloodlines, are entered in Schutzhund 
(protection dog) competitions, which test a dog's skills -- including its 
ability to run and knock down a man wearing a full protective body suit. 
</P>
<P>
"You teach them to tackle like a linebacker," Tackett said. "Some of the 
trainers have gotten cracked ribs . . . and most of them end up with bad backs. 
It's very physical work." 
</P>
<P>
Training a dog can cost from $300 for basic obedience to $3,000 and up for 
advanced, specialized protection training. 
</P>
<P>
For about $800, a dog can be trained to provide an acceptable level of 
protection, Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll alert when told, and bite if someone gets aggressive," Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tackett and Terrazas agree that the demand for protection dogs has 
increased in recent years. "It used to be 10% of my business; now it's probably 
40%," Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrazas says that business often picks up after highly publicized crimes, such 
as the Night Stalker murders or the 1988 killing of auto racing figure Mickey 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, more people want it," Terrazas said. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hill said she got her first guard dog because her husband was out of town 
so often "and the football schedule's right there in the paper for everyone to 
read." 
</P>
<P>
"The dog's great with the kids," said Hill, who has two young boys. "And we 
don't get too many magazine salesmen."

Be not afraid of any man. 
</P>
<P>
 Not matter what his size; 
</P>
<P>
 When danger threatens, call on me 
</P>
<P>
 And I will equalize. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 19th-Century motto, Winchester Rifle Co. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Escandon steps up to the starting line, her three-inch heels sinking 
into sandy desert soil, a purse slung jauntily over one shoulder, eyes 
invisible behind black-tinted sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
She considers the enemies before her: targets painted to resemble such would-be 
attackers as a burly, middle-aged white man, a skinhead with a Mohawk and a 
swastika tattoo, and a bare-chested black man. 
</P>
<P>
At the signal, she reaches into a secret compartment of the purse and pulls out 
a snub-nosed, .38-caliber revolver. The five-foot, 100-pound Escandon rushes 
toward the targets, a flash of fire exploding from the revolver muzzle with 
each pull of the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The bullets sing as they pierce the targets, the sound echoing through the 
desert valleys of San Bernardino National Forest, as Escandon strikes the last 
of the assailants square in the chest. "All shots are good," an instructor 
announces, and Escandon returns to a car where she packs the revolver and 
ammunition in a shiny black Lancome makeup bag with a zipper top. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Escandon described herself as "totally anti-handgun." But with 
all the crime these days -- the FBI reports that a forcible rape occurs every 
six minutes in this country -- Escandon says she must learn to defend herself 
in ways she never imagined. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she recently found herself spending a chilly Saturday in a remote 
public shooting area, participating in a firearms class for women that 
rehearses real-life scenarios, such as having to draw from a purse while 
wearing high heels. Another scenario involves rolling out of bed and using both 
a pistol and a shotgun to mow down intruders. 
</P>
<P>
The rehearsals make Escandon feel more comfortable about using the revolver she 
keeps in a drawer of her nightstand. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so much safer," said Escandon, a Costa Mesa resident whose husband is 
often away on business trips. "I feel secure knowing that I have it. I pray I 
never have to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Mace, stun-guns, personal alarms, martial-arts training, pistols, even shotguns 
-- these are some of the self-defense tactics that women are turning to because 
they don't feel safe anymore, according to Cathy Tolley, who organized the 
firearms class for women. 
</P>
<P>
Tolley, a registered nurse, is a firearms instructor certified by the National 
Rifle Assn. She has informally conducted several classes for women in the last 
year, recruiting participants from the standard firearms courses she and her 
boyfriend teach. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day class for women included a morning of firearms training in the 
living room of Tolley's Anaheim home and an afternoon of shooting in the 
desert. Tolley said she designed the all-female shooting class because for many 
women, learning to handle firearms "is like going into the men's locker room." 
</P>
<P>
The class also incorporated other self-defense strategies, including the proper 
response to wolf whistles ("I would appreciate it if you would keep your 
comments to yourself") and how to elude intruders in your own home ("Look for 
places to hide, or where your opponent might hide"). 
</P>
<P>
But even Tolley, who has eight years of martial-arts training and arms strong 
enough to pump a shotgun effortlessly, says the only way she could overpower a 
male attacker would be with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
"A firearm is the ultimate equalizer," Tolley told the class. "No matter how 
big the man is, how many drugs he's on, you'll be able to defend yourself. I 
believe if all those men knew we were . . . carrying a pistol in our purses, 
they'd think twice about attacking." 
</P>
<P>
None of the seven women in the class have had to use a gun against an attacker. 
In fact, none said she had turned to firearms training as a result of being 
assaulted. Rather, they perceive through news reports that women are 
increasingly on the receiving end of violent crimes and that those who assault 
women spend little, if any, time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"No place is safe," said Deborah Benjamin of Anaheim, who keeps a .357-caliber 
pistol in her bedroom. "There's wackos everywhere you go. Those creeps know 
they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
One of Escandon's friends was recently assaulted in the parking lot of a 
department store by a crowbar-wielding robber. "A crowbar," she said. "Can you 
believe it?" 
</P>
<P>
Amy Clover, a 19-year-old Fullerton College student, said she resents the way 
men often size her up. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry not about date rape but about rape, period," Clover said. "The way 
some people look at me . . . I can tell what they're thinking. I know what's on 
their minds." 
</P>
<P>
Until September, Clover said she had never fired a gun. It was the controversy 
surrounding the state Legislature's ban on assault rifles that motivated her to 
seek firearms training. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been paranoid of guns, but once I went to a class it was fun," 
Clover said. "I don't have a gun and I don't plan on getting one right now. I 
just wanted to know how to use one." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Jones had done a little shooting with her father and brothers when she was 
a child, but when her husband mentioned this year that he wanted to buy a gun 
to keep in the house, "I was scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
However, she agreed to take a firearms class and discovered that firing a gun 
could be pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
"I really surprised myself about how much I enjoyed it, particularly the 
competitive aspect," said Jones, 30, of Long Beach. "I go to the shooting range 
at least once a week. It's a great release of stress." 
</P>
<P>
Jones also found it intoxicating to shoot more powerful pistols such as .38- or 
.45-caliber weapons instead of the .22-caliber guns often recommended for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had ever encouraged me to try a more powerful gun," Jones said. "After 
the first time I shot a .45, I thought: 'That's amazing. I'm a woman, and I can 
handle this.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is legal to keep firearms in the home or a place of business, and last year 
28,071 firearms were legally purchased in Orange County, up from 26,823 in 
1987, according to the state Department of Justice. Since the state requires 
only a one-time notification of a firearms sale, there is no way to tell how 
many Orange County residents overall own guns or how many firearms have been 
purchased illegally, said Margaret Bourff of the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a concealed weapon, however, is against state law unless the gun owner 
has a permit. Such permits are rarely issued, except to some public officials 
or individuals who demonstrate the need for a concealed firearm. In Orange 
County, there were only 225 concealed weapons permits issued in 1988, according 
to state figures. The year before, only 10 of the 257 permits issued went to 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting someone with a concealed weapon is a felony, and local law enforcement 
agencies frown upon teaching people how to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't condone any type of instruction for anything that's against the law," 
said Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Tolley is careful to advise her students of the implications of shooting with a 
concealed weapon, including the likelihood of arrest and the possibility of 
going to prison. But in Tolley's opinion, "it's better to be judged by 12 than 
carried by six." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take my chances," Escandon said. As for the idea that an attacker will be 
able to take her gun away, Escandon said, "I'm not going to let anybody get 
that close to me." 
</P>
<P>
Although the women are staunch opponents of gun control, including the ban on 
assault rifles, they have been reluctant to disclose their use of guns to 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
Escandon said that some members of her family still don't know that she started 
shooting about six months ago and now owns a gun. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of people when they learn you have a gun . . . it's like all of a 
sudden I'm this vile person because I have a gun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said she took her co-workers by surprise when she mentioned she likes to 
shoot. "It's been a more positive response than I expected," she said. "You 
just have to get people to see that you're buying it for self-protection, that 
you're trained and know what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question of killing another living thing, be it a deer, a dove or an 
attacker, can be a troubling one for women. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't shoot people to injure them," Tolley told the class. "If you didn't 
think it was a killing situation -- kill or be killed -- then you'd better not 
shoot somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Toni Bauer, a Garden Grove mother of two, said she has considered whether she 
is capable of shooting another person. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that if someone threatened my children, I could do it," Bauer 
said. "But if was just me . . . I don't know."

Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
In medieval times, a moat and drawbridge kept most intruders out of the castle. 
But modern Orange County residents increasingly are turning to sophisticated 
high-tech equipment to protect their dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Police and security specialists say there are several reasons for the boom in 
burglar-alarm sales. More families are relying on two incomes, and their 
deserted homes become tempting break-in targets during daytime hours. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the price of home security equipment has dropped, putting it 
well within the reach of budget-conscious families. Today's high-tech alarms 
also appeal to young adults who have become hooked on electronic gadgetry, from 
personal computers to compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, daily reports of gang violence and drug abuse have heightened concerns 
about personal safety. Although home burglary reports in Orange County have 
been declining slightly since 1984, a single high-profile crime spree can send 
many residents scrambling for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Night Stalker was out, our phone didn't stop ringing," recalled 
Clarence Peer, owner of Dial One Amtech Security Corp. in Brea. "We were 
backlogged continuously." 
</P>
<P>
Today, security-conscious homeowners are faced with a dizzying array of 
products and services, from install-it-yourself alarms for less than $500 to 
customized technician-installed systems for up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing a growing demand for modestly priced systems, mass marketers such as 
Brinks and Black &amp; Decker have targeted the Orange County home security 
market in recent years, creating mixed reactions from independent installers. 
</P>
<P>
"They advertise a lot," said Peer. "It makes people more aware, and it helps 
all of us." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "These cut-rate prices are exactly that -- their marketing 
philosophy is to put a lot of systems in very quickly and pick up the monthly 
monitoring account. Then people have to be concerned about how well it will be 
serviced." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Brinks and Black &amp; Decker insist that the quality of their 
products is comparable to that offered by independent installers. Nationwide 
marketing helps them keep the costs down, they said. 
</P>
<P>
George De Marco, president of the Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. of Orange 
County, said he's not disturbed by the lower-priced systems. "I think there's a 
market for that," said De Marco, who is president of Greater Alarm Co. in 
Huntington Beach. "More competition is good for any industry." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 19,000 home burglaries occurred in Orange County during 1988, according 
to the California Bureau of Crime Statistics. Of these, 9,577 occurred during 
daytime hours and 4,960 at night. The time of the break-in was uncertain in the 
remaining 4,428 burglaries. Security experts say 85% of home 
</P>
<P>
burglaries occur when no one is at home. The front door is the most common 
entry point, with windows a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who buy burglar alarms usually announce it to potential thieves via 
lawn signs or window stickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Crooks are not smart but they are percentage players," said Robert M. Johnson, 
president of Anaheim-based Central Station Security Systems, which handles 
burglar alarm calls from 31,000 homes and businesses. "The first purpose (of a 
home security system) is to be visible as a deterrent. The second part is to 
detect an entry and to let everyone know a burglary has been committed -- even 
the burglar." 
</P>
<P>
Police agencies concede that they can't constantly patrol the neighborhoods 
targeted by burglars. "We have absolutely no problem whatsoever with anyone who 
wants to make their life more secure by installing a home security system," 
said Lt. Richard Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But residents of unincorporated Orange County and most of the county's cities 
must pay a penalty if they trigger more than two or three false alarms annually 
to the Sheriff's Department or local police. The fines vary by city, but in 
Newport Beach, repeated false alarms can result in a fine of more than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Security experts say a home burglar commonly seeks a television set, video 
recorder or computer in the family room and cash, jewelry or firearms in the 
master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such break-ins, the typical home security system uses electrical 
contacts that signal a controller box when a door or window is open while the 
system is active. A resident usually has about 40 seconds to turn off the 
system by punching a code into a key pad, similar to that on a touch-tone 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
If the code is not entered, the alarm sounds, usually causing the intruder to 
flee immediately. Many systems are also connected to an automatic telephone 
dialer that either signals police directly or alerts a security monitoring 
service. 
</P>
<P>
If a service is used, the operator usually telephones the home. If the alarm 
was triggered accidentally, the resident gives a password, and the alarm is 
disregarded. If no one answers or an incorrect password is given, the operator 
contacts the local police department. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribing to a monitoring service generally costs $20 to $30 per month. 
Proponents say these private operators prevent police from being flooded with 
false alarm calls. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the door and window contacts, many home security systems use 
motion detectors that trigger an alarm when an intruder is inside. These 
include infrared models that sense body heat, photoelectric units that activate 
when an intruder breaks a light beam and ultrasonic detectors that use sound 
waves to find moving objects. 
</P>
<P>
People who have indoor pets face an extra challenge when using motion 
detectors. In some cases, the devices can be positioned to create "pet alleys" 
so animals moving close to the floor will not set off the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is an under-carpet foot sensor that is triggered by the 
weight of human intruder but not a lighter pet. 
</P>
<P>
For residents who worry about a face-to-face confrontation with an intruder, 
many security systems also provide panic buttons in the bedroom and elsewhere 
to allow immediate activation of the alarm. Portable panic buttons that fit 
inside a purse provide peace of mind when walking from the car to the house. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond burglary, a security system can be linked to a smoke detector to summon 
firefighters even if one is at home when a blaze begins. 
</P>
<P>
The cost and sophistication of home security systems vary significantly. Alarm 
sensors can be wired directly to the controller, running beneath the carpet or 
through the attic. Or battery-powered wireless sensors can trigger the alarm 
with radio signals or audible tones. 
</P>
<P>
For the do-it-yourself set, Radio Shack offers motion sensors, sirens and entry 
switches or alarm package sets starting at less than $150. 
</P>
<P>
For $295, Brinks will install a hard-wire system with three entry switches and 
one interior motion detector. Brinks retains ownership of the equipment and 
requires a minimum two-year subscription to its monitoring service, which costs 
$19.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
For about $500, Black &amp; Decker sells a wireless system that the homeowner 
can install with just a screwdriver. It includes sensors for six entry points, 
two sirens and a lamp flasher. A telephone dialer and monitoring service are 
options that about one-third of Black &amp; Decker's customers choose for an 
extra charge, company spokesman Peter Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who hire an independent security firm to install a customized 
hard-wire system in an average Orange County home can expect to pay about 
$1,500. But that cost can vary according to the size of the home and complexity 
of the system. 
</P>
<P>
BUYING A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
The Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. of Orange County and local police offer these 
tips for buying a home security system: 
</P>
<P>
* Get estimates from at least three companies and make sure the quotes are for 
comparable equipment and services. 
</P>
<P>
* Find out how long the company has been in business and ask for references. 
Make sure the company is licensed by the California Department of Consumer 
Affairs. For elaborate installations, a state contractor's license may also be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
* The county and most Orange County cities have burglar alarm laws. Find out 
about permit requirements, false alarm penalties and restrictions on the length 
of time a burglar alarm is allowed to sound. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask if a monthly security monitoring contract is required. Ask about 
connection to a smoke alarm, if that protection is desired.

ANN CONWAY: THEY'LL BE BACK AGAIN ON SUNDAY -- TO HAVE A BALL AND SEE A BALL 
(GAME)

"Next Sunday, you're all coming here again!" The Rams slayed the Giants, 19-13, 
and John Crean's face was pink with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"You sure you want us all back?" a guest replied at the football-watching party 
Crean staged in his Santa Ana Heights home last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. But it looks like we'd better buy some more chairs!" he told the 
SRO crowd. 
</P>
<P>
This was no plop-on-the-floor-and-watch-football get-together. This was a party 
staged in the movie-set like theater in Crean's yet-to-be-completed 
40,000-square-foot mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of feels like we're on a cruise ship, doesn't it?" said Crean, 
grinning like a schoolboy as his eyes took in the room with the wall-size 
screen, the plush carpet and the 20 or so padded chairs. 
</P>
<P>
To say the least. And Crean's pals -- among them, Supervisor Don Roth and his 
wife, Jackie; Ritz-Carlton Vice President Henry Schielein and his wife, Carol, 
and Ted and Lois Lundberg -- were willing passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the mansion early for the 9:30 a.m. kickoff, they climbed its 
sweeping, Tara-esque staircase with the temporary railing (made of 2x4s and 
chicken wire) and swept into the gleaming new theater after selecting 
made-to-order omelets, lox, bagels, fresh fruit and hot buttered popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Don and I met at a Rams game," Jackie Roth said, beaming at her husband as she 
settled into a chair to root for the Giants. The Giants? "Just for today!" she 
said, looking sheepish. (However, the feisty redhead was on her feet rooting 
for the Rams during the overtime that saw Jim Everett sail the winning 
touchdown pass to Flipper Anderson.) 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," Jackie continued, "when Don and I told Carroll Rosenbloom (Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere's late husband) that we met at a Rams game, he sent us 
a beautiful gift. We've known Georgia for years." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene was Katie Klein, wife of Marshall Klein, Rams vice president 
of media and community relations. There could be no doubt which team Katie was 
rooting for. She wore a tiny, solid gold Rams helmet around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Katie said, fingering the diamond-studded pendant, a gift from her 
husband. "And I love the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
Come this Sunday, the gang will be at the Creans' home again and so will the 
omelets, the agony and the ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more fun than this?" Crean wanted to know. "That's what this theater is 
all about. It's a way to bring people together. It's more fun than all of us 
being at our own homes watching the game by ourselves, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
By the look on guests' faces, the answer was a gimme-10 "yes!" 
</P>
<P>
Also rooting for the Rams: Crean's wife, Donna ("I'm looking forward to using 
this theater to watch my soaps!" she said, laughing); his sons John and Andy, 
with his wife, Charlene; Jerry Kobrin, and Dr. Bob Roper. 
</P>
<P>
A Winter Dinner: On its "12th Night of Christmas" party, Opera Pacific Gourmet 
Diners' Guild gave to its members: boneless pork loin, sweet and sour red 
cabbage, parsley-butter potatoes, a fresh fruit platter, several pasta salads, 
and a piano concert by Danny Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
It all happened at Bill and Laila Conlin's Chateau Musique in Newport Beach on 
Saturday night, the warm and cozy kind of party that has become the hallmark of 
the Gourmet Diners' Guild. 
</P>
<P>
Chairing the second annual affair was Myril Kreuder, who attended with her 
husband, Norm. "Everybody likes to come to Myril's events," said Laila, dressed 
in a midnight blue satin blouse and flowing velvet skirt. "She always makes 
sure everyone has a wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
Arriving guests were greeted with the sound of a drum roll and the sight of 
little-drummer-boy decor, a theme the guild plans to use year after year. 
</P>
<P>
After guests helped themselves to the hearty fare cooked up by Jay's Catering, 
they pulled up their chairs to listen to Shapiro, who thrilled the opera buffs 
with selections by Beethoven, Chopin and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
Laila Conlin, founding president of Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance, said the 
Gourmet Guild was one of 11 guilds (with 700 members) that have contributed 
$500,000 to Opera Pacific since being established two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a variety of guilds to appeal to a variety of interests," Laila said. 
"People have so many things to support we decided to come up with a new idea. 
We didn't want to be a clone." 
</P>
<P>
Guild Alliance members can join the Gourmet Diners' Guild; the Viva Guild (a 
group that visits operatic productions staged by companies other than Opera 
Pacific); the Prologues Guild, which stages educational events, and the Opera 
Ball Guild, which is strictly dedicated to staging Opera Pacific's annual gala. 
There are also tennis and bridge guilds and a newly developed guild, New You, 
devoted to self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"The unique thing," Laila said, "is that our members can belong to any or all 
of the guilds. All they have to do is put up the money!"

CYPRESS COLLEGE AWARDS DINNER GETS A MAGICAL KICKOFF 
</P>

<P>
For 70 North County movers and shakers, Disneyland's plush, members-only Club 
33 was a personal Magic Kingdom last week. 
</P>
<P>
They rode in an old-fashioned elevator copied from one Walt saw in Europe, 
walked past a crystal phone booth from the set of "The Happiest Millionaire," 
sipped wine by the buffet, and piled hors d'oeuvres onto tiny plates. 
</P>
<P>
Then they moved into the main dining area, which has dark wood, heavy green 
drapes and framed etchings -- the re-created Old World that Walt Disney dreamed 
to life. Unfortunately, he died five months before Club 33 opened in May, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Gathering at Club 33 -- its discreet entrance off one of the streets in the 
park's New Orleans Square -- were organizers of the annual Americana Awards 
dinner staged by Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, slated for late February, has its own Disney theme this year. The 
$125-per-person fund-raiser will be at the Disneyland Hotel and its chief 
honoree is Ronald Dominguez, executive vice president of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the kickoff party were escorted through the park at closing time for 
cocktail hour pep talks from dinner chairman Don Karcher, Cypress College 
President Kirk Avery and college foundation President Irv Pickler. 
</P>
<P>
But first -- a little eating and ogling inside the club. 
</P>
<P>
Etched and painted pirates and beasts fight for a spot on the crowded walls. An 
antique grandfather clock ticks in one corner, and in another, under a silk 
cover, sits a harpsichord that belongs to Lillian Disney, Walt's widow. In one 
dining room, the chandeliers are rigged with microphones -- Walt's idea for 
parlor games only he could imagine -- and in another, a fireplace mantel holds 
a spray of peacock feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Ned Fox grinned when asked about his impression of le club. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here for other occasions," said the Cypress Chamber of Commerce 
executive director, "and I always feel the same. Any time you get to go to Club 
33, it's a special night." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me where to sign up (for a membership)," said Christine Nelson, looking 
around. "I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
"If we sign up now," joked her husband, Keith, "maybe our grandkids could get 
in, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, there is a waiting list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," said Nelson, a college foundation member. "We're just glad to be 
getting a look in here." 
</P>
<P>
So was Buena Park Councilwoman Donna L. Chessen. "I've been supposed to come 
here . . . and it's never worked out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Guests munched on beef teriyaki brochettes, quiche Lorraine, duck pate on 
endive, and smoked oysters and cucumbers stuffed with lobster salad and topped 
with slivers of smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher, Avery and Pickler took turns at the podium discussing the upcoming 
awards dinner, which according to Pickler is expected to raise more than 
$100,000 for the college.

JOSEPH N. BELL: DOCUMENTARY DRIVES HOME A LESSON ON GM'S PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of years ago, I wrote a piece for the Saturday Evening Post about a 
bachelor factory worker in Chicago named Joe Swedie who used every cent he 
earned not required for basic living to rent movies and show them to kids in 
hospitals. He discovered what a joyous relief from pain and despair this 
provided sick children when, as a GI in France in World War II, he took his 
company projector and films into French hospitals. When he returned home, he 
just kept on doing it, without help or recognition -- neither of which he ever 
felt he needed. 
</P>
<P>
He was real. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ways he saved money for renting films was by driving an ancient 
Chevrolet that had 270,000 miles on its speedometer when I first came upon this 
exemplary man. After my story was finished and accepted, I saw the page layout 
several weeks ahead of publication and discovered the Post was using a large 
picture of Joe with his car. This was an enormous plug for the staying power of 
Chevrolet, so I wrote the CEO of General Motors, told him what was coming up, 
and suggested that GM could get some further mileage from the story by giving 
Joe a new car, as publicly as they chose. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics may have been questionable, but the motive wasn't. Joe's car was 
almost at the point of collapse, and I had made his rounds with him enough 
times to know what a terrible loss it would be to his kids if he could no 
longer get there. So I took a shot at getting him a new car. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of hearing from the CEO, I received a form letter from the personnel 
director of the Chevrolet Division saying that the company had no openings at 
the moment but would put my letter on file. It so angered me that I made a copy 
of my original letter and returned the form letter to the public relations 
director of Chevrolet, along with some scabrous comments about the compassion 
and perspicacity of GM. 
</P>
<P>
This produced a telephone call from the PR director inviting me to Detroit at 
GM's expense to have lunch with him. I told him I didn't want to have lunch 
with him, I just wanted a car for Joe Swedie, and he said that he couldn't help 
there, but he sure would be happy to pop for lunch -- and there the matter 
ended. Joe got a car some months later as the subject of one of Ralph Edwards' 
"This Is Your Life" episodes (which is quite another story, almost as bad as 
the GM episode) -- and I've carried a mild dose of rancor toward GM ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to last Saturday night when I went to see "Roger &amp; Me," 
presently playing in Orange County movie houses. This is an absolutely 
marvelous documentary account of the efforts of an ex-journalist named Michael 
Moore to get the current CEO of GM, Roger Smith, to come to Flint, Mich., and 
see firsthand the destruction the company has wrought by closing all its plants 
there and moving them to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The film offers a devastating depiction of corporate greed and stupidity in 
which GM officials contribute mightily on camera to their own execution. It is 
also patently and outrageously unfair and jovially tunnel-visioned. Moore uses 
his interview subjects with a kind of blithe savoir-faire that often leaves 
them looking like idiots in order to make his points. 
</P>
<P>
I came away with a lot of mixed feelings. First, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing GM 
-- which certainly has the wherewithal to protect itself -- get its 
comeuppance. Second, I realized at what a disadvantage people being interviewed 
find themselves since they have no idea how the interview will be used, 
especially if it takes place on camera. That, in turn, raised the question in 
my mind of whether it is justifiable to stomp some minor players in order to 
stick it to a bully that richly deserves such treatment. I don't have an answer 
to that one yet. And, finally, it left me wondering if the public relations 
profession had been dealt a mortal blow by "Roger &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
No one -- not even Roger Smith -- comes out looking quite as bad as the GM PR 
people. I have no idea if they advised Smith to cooperate and he refused or if 
they counseled the course of action he took. Either way, they blew it. With 
cameras grinding away, they played directly into Moore's hands by sounding 
confused, officious, obstinate, unfeeling and -- a couple of times -- as if 
they were bordering on panic. The only company representative who defended the 
company's position in an honest, straightforward way (whether or not one agreed 
with him) was later fired. GM should have canonized him. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered if local public relations professionals shared these feelings -- and 
how they would have handled Michael Moore and his documentary had they been in 
charge of GM public relations? 
</P>
<P>
So I called one of Orange County's leading public relations practitioners who 
once held a similar post in a major corporation. He was uncomfortable about 
being publicly critical of his associates so asked if he could talk without 
attribution -- a noblesse oblige to which I agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "the automotive industry is notorious for its bad 
public relations. So this doesn't surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have handled it in the same way I think most of my associates in 
Orange County -- and most good public relations professionals anywhere -- would 
have handled it. Under no circumstances would I have tried to avoid filling the 
request of anyone with legitimate media credentials. Such avoidance simply 
makes it possible for the person seeking the interview to make a big deal out 
of not getting it. 
</P>
<P>
"If the CEO refused my advice to cooperate -- for whatever reason -- I would 
try to put the media person with the next highest administrative officer in the 
company. Openness is always the best policy." 
</P>
<P>
If GM's high-priced public relations people had recognized and acted on this 
simple rule of thumb, there probably never would have been a "Roger &amp; Me." 
So it serves them right. Besides, they should have given that car to Joe 
Swedie.

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev flew to Lithuania today and urged its restive people to 
remain within the Soviet Union, warning that their drive for independence could 
lead to national tragedy and that his personal fate hinges on their choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader addressed a crowd of several hundred in Vilnius as at least 
200,000 people began massing for a demonstration in the Lithuanian capital to 
demand the restoration of the Baltic republic's prewar independence. 
</P>
<P>
His comments were aimed at cooling pro-independence passions as he embarked on 
a crucial mission to persuade Lithuanian Communists to reverse a decision to 
split from the federal Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been tied together for these 50 years, whether we like it or not," 
Gorbachev said, walking through a crowd of several hundred after laying a 
wreath at a monument to V. I. Lenin. "And all the more so, we have not lived in 
a federation. We have lived in a unitary state with its own realities." 
</P>
<P>
One person called out to Gorbachev: "People must decide their own fate!" 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will be decided without you," Gorbachev responded as he slowly made 
his way back to his limousine. "We will decide everything together." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Remember, if someone succeeds in pitting us against each other 
in a clash, there will be a tragedy. We should not allow this." 
</P>
<P>
Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania along with the two other Baltic states, Latvia 
and Estonia, in 1940 under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Subacius, a spokesman for the Sajudis political movement pressing for 
Lithuanian independence, said in a telephone interview to Moscow that several 
hundred thousand people gathered in Cathedral Square for an evening rally. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering began with 15 minutes of silence. Many people held candles, red, 
green and gold Lithuanian flags, and the red-and-white banner of neighboring 
Latvia, Subacius said. 
</P>

Vytautus Landsbergis, head of Sajudis, referred to Gorbachev as "head of a 
great neighbor state," emphasizing the view that Lithuania is an independent 
land, Subacius said.

<P>
As the rally was going on, Gorbachev was meeting elsewhere with Communist Party 
members, according to an unofficial schedule. 
</P>
<P>
As never before in his nearly five years in power, Gorbachev put his personal 
prestige on the line in coming to Lithuania, exposing himself to a population 
that openly disagrees with him. At times, he adopted a pleading tone as he 
spoke to the people earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We have embarked on this path and I am the one who chose it," he said. "My 
personal fate is linked to this choice."

If Gorbachev fails to bring the Lithuanians back to the fold, Communist Parties 
in the 14 other republics could feel encouraged to break with Moscow.

The Soviet leader said the rights of all minorities in the Soviet Union must be 
respected, or it could endanger the unity of the country's more than 100 ethnic 
groups.

Persistent dense fog continued to hamper operations at John Wayne Airport this 
morning, causing the cancellation of one flight and the rerouting of several 
others after the airport was shut down at 6:45 p.m. last night because of poor 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines Flight 112 scheduled to depart at 6:50 a.m. today for 
Minneapolis was canceled, according to an airline spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers were taken to Los Angeles International for a substitute flight, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket agents and John Wayne Airport officials reported at least three other 
flight interruptions today. A number of flights were delayed last night, 
according to airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
One incoming American Airlines flight from Oakland was diverted today and its 
passengers bused into Orange County, said Gail McKinzie, assistant manager for 
airport information at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Airlines officials reported that one flight from Tampa, Fla., had to land 
in San Diego this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Two Northwest Airlines flights -- one from Seattle and the other from Minnesota 
-- had to be rerouted to airports in San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fowler, manager of the tower at John Wayne, said visibility "went below 
flight minimums for arrivals and departures." 
</P>
<P>
An airport official said he expected the fog to lessen this afternoon and 
Friday. He said flight operations will continue to be "hairy" and noted that 
rain predicted for Friday should help dissipate the fog.

Los Angeles police have begun a search for the killer of an 85-year-old Van 
Nuys woman after an autopsy revealed that she was raped and beaten to death in 
her bed at a local retirement home, authorities said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Libbie Noble was found dead at 7 a.m. Sunday at the Valley View Retirement 
Center in the 7700 block of Woodman Avenue, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy conducted Wednesday found evidence of sexual assault, and the cause 
of death was listed as blunt force trauma, Detective Jim Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no identified suspects in the case. Vojtecky said there was no sign 
of forced entry in the second-floor apartment Noble shared with another elderly 
woman. The roommate, who is deaf, apparently slept through the attack and has 
been unable to aid police, Vojtecky said.

<P>
The man chosen to enforce Chicago's ethics laws resigned today, one day after 
officials learned that he had been implicated in alleged campaign fund-raising 
violations in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Gary M. O'Neill, who started work as executive director of 
the Board of Ethics on Dec. 12, was announced in a statement from the board. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who helped Louisiana's Commissioner of Insurance Doug Green finance 
his successful 1987 campaign, was a defendant in a lawsuit by Louisiana's 
ethics board. The lawsuit accused Green of attempting to conceal the source of 
$2.2 million in contributions to his 1987 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was thrown out last year when the ethics board's enforcement 
provisions were declared unconstitutional by a state judge. A re-hearing of the 
issue is pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the Board of Ethics has egg all over their face because they're 
supposed to make the appropriate checks" before hiring someone, said J. 
Terrence Bruner, executive director of the Better Government Assn., a watchdog 
group.

UTILITY PLAYS HOST TO JURY AFTER FAVORABLE VERDICT

<P>
Dallas jurors who gave Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. a favorable verdict in 
a $419-million lawsuit will be flown to Houston at the utility's expense for a 
tour of its nuclear plant and a stay at a luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The utility confirmed that it invited the jurors about a month ago, the Houston 
Chronicle reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Graham Painter said that because the jurors' role in the case is 
over, there is nothing improper about HL&amp;P Chairman Don Jordan playing host 
and showing off the plant. 
</P>
<P>
He did not know how many jurors would accept the offer, nor would he estimate 
the cost of the air fare and overnight accommodations during the trip this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors decided in July that the utility's partner in the South Texas 
Nuclear Project, the city of Austin, deserved no damages for HL&amp;P's 
withholding information that would have allowed the city to anticipate huge 
cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Austin said the invitation to jurors and the judge was just 
the latest impropriety in the utility's push for the plant, whose cost 
ballooned from $900 million to almost $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's highly unprofessional and very questionable. Until the people of Texas 
realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the people hundreds of millions of 
dollars, it won't stop," said City Councilman George Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and awards no damages 
and a short time later, they're offered free air fare, free lodging, free meals 
and first-class treatment, it can't help but cast a doubt."

Columbia's astronauts mopped up water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they 
closed in on the floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space 
Friday with the shuttle's robot arm. 
</P>
<P>
Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee executed three engine-firing 
maneuvers today, putting Columbia on a near-collision course with the satellite 
they have been chasing since they were launched Tuesday onto a path 1,725 miles 
behind their quarry. 
</P>
<P>
Once the astronauts move in on the 11-ton target, they will fly in formation 35 
feet away while mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar reaches out with Columbia's 
50-foot mechanical arm to snare the 30-foot satellite, which is as large as a 
small school bus. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, she will make the catch at 9:48 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of the satellite, 
known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low interrupted their flight plans 
for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of about two gallons of 
water, shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads. 
</P>
<P>
They shut off the faulty dehumidifier, shifted to a backup, and then went to 
work on the water with towels and a hand-held vacuum, using a flashlight to dry 
cables and other surfaces. Loose water, which forms beads and globules in 
weightlessness, can interfere with electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the water, 
Brandenstein remarked, "It's kind of a mess right now. I'll get the 
plumber-of-the-year award, but not the housekeeper-of-the-year award." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how various systems and 
materials withstood the long stay in orbit, information that will help in 
designing the space station and other space vehicles.

Flood waters from a series of storms that killed six people in the Pacific 
Northwest were receding today, but highway and rail traffic between the 
region's two major cities remained seriously curtailed. 
</P>

Damage from high winds and five days of rain and flooding was expected to run 
into the tens of millions of dollars, said state officials and insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not even begun to assess financial damage," said Joanne Schwartz, a 
commissioner in Washington's Lewis County. "We do know that we have numerous 
county roads that have to be rebuilt. This is the worst flooding everybody says 
that they have ever seen."

Ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov is likely to face charges of abuse of 
power, fraud and violating human rights, a member of a parliamentary commission 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry might stop short, however, of unearthing irregularities by 
Communists still in power, said Petar Beron, a commission member and 
pro-democracy activist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy job," Beron said, because some of Zhivkov's associates "are 
still very much at large." 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission is also looking into "the drainage of public money" by 
Zhivkov, the hard-liner who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until his ouster Nov. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Beron said Zhivkov had siphoned millions from state-run foundations promoting 
arts and education, to help build more than 30 villas and luxurious residences 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Lyuben Kolishev, a leader of the commission, said Tuesday that enough evidence 
had already been gathered on Zhivkov to open criminal proceedings on charges of 
embezzlement of state funds. 
</P>
<P>
Kolishev said he has evidence that Zhivkov had Swiss bank accounts. He gave no 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
Beron said the government requested Swiss authorities to open the accounts but 
noted this would only be agreed to once a legal case was opened for crimes that 
would also be punishable under Swiss law. 
</P>
<P>
Beron said Zhivkov will be charged and then brought to trial after the 
commission completes its investigation, probably by the end of January.

China today dismissed as "utterly illegal and absurd" an approach by Taiwan to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Geneva-based world trade watchdog 
organization must reject the application. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Economic Ministry said a week ago that the island had formally applied 
to join GATT as an independent customs territory. 
</P>
<P>
By filing the application, the spokesman told a briefing for foreign 
journalists here, the Taiwan authorities were posing as the government of a 
sovereign country although the island is part of the only legal Chinese state, 
ruled by Beijing. Both Beijing and Taipei insist that there can be only one 
true China.

Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. has come up with a new plan to produce compact cars in

</P>
<P>
The plan was presented today to Polish public vehicle production company 
Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych. 
</P>

The Daihatsu plan calls for FSO to assemble 6,000 Daihatsu-designed Charade 
cars annually, with components supplied by Daihatsu in Japan. The phased-in 
investment will represent no financial difficulties for the Polish firm, said 
Daihatsu. 
</P>
<P>
In a previous proposal FSO and Daihatsu had faced difficulty securing loans 
from the Japanese government because more than $690 million was required, a 
Daihatsu spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan is expected to provide financing for this 
project, the spokesman said.

WATERFORD CRYSTAL WORKERS WARNED JOBS ARE ON THE LINE

The boss of the Waterford Wedgwood PLC crystal and china group told its workers 
today that they could lose their jobs if they reject new cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Further sacrifices must now be made. . . . Anything else leads to commercial 
suicide," chief executive Patrick Galvin said in a letter to the group's 2,000 
crystal workers in Waterford. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most highly paid industrial workers in Ireland, they have angrily 
rejected management plans to stop bonuses, cut contract staff by 250 and bring 
in longer hours. Six months ago they agreed to a three-year wage freeze. 
</P>
<P>
The crystal and china group is weighed down by debts of up to 150 million Irish 
punts ($235 million), and sales have slumped in its crucial British and U.S 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has gained new urgency since Tony O'Reilly, the Irish-born chairman 
of U.S. food giant H. J. Heinz, recently put together a group of foreign 
investors in his Fitzwilton PLC industrial holding group to negotiate to buy a 
stake of up to 29.9% in Waterford. An interest of that size, the highest that 
can be held without having to make a full takeover bid, is valued at 70 million 
punts ($110 million).

He declined to confirm or deny a report in today's Wall Street Journal that

It would be the first venture in Eastern Europe for GM and the first of any

MOST COMPANIES EXPECTED TO DISREGARD KING HOLIDAY 
</P>

<P>
Four out of five companies nationwide are expected to ignore Monday's Martin 
Luther King holiday, with social services the most likely business sector to 
respect the day commemorating the black civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
Financial trading exchanges are mostly snubbing the holiday, fearing that 
investors would simply switch to overseas markets rather than miss a day's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of National Affairs Inc., a Washington-based information service, 
surveyed hundreds of companies and of the 317 firms that responded, 18% said 
they will grant a paid holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 17% gave a day off, against the 14% that observed the holiday when 
it began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It's barely a rise at all over the years. The primary reason is probably 
simply that it does cost employers money to give an extra paid holiday," said 
the bureau's Mike Reidy. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that unionized organizations and government agencies are most likely 
to respect the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Among non-business organizations -- such as hospitals, schools and government 
agencies -- 37% will grant a day off, against 18% of non-manufacturing and 9% 
of manufacturing companies that replied. 
</P>
<P>
"And although the difference is borderline, it has shown up for the past two 
years that the holiday is least prevalent in the West and most prevalent in the 
Northeast," Reidy added. 
</P>
<P>
The King Federal Holiday Commission, set up by Congress to encourage the event, 
also saw regional differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Southerners are most sensitive to it, and in the Northwest frontier, people 
are unaware. But one in five businesses nationally -- that would be wonderful, 
a big step," said the commission's Charles Sadler. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is a racial overtone behind some companies' decision to ignore 
the day. "In part, it's also money. And a lack of popular support among the 
personnel too." 
</P>
<P>
Sadler said businesses are reticent to lose money while some of their staff are 
uninformed, or uninterested, in King. 
</P>
<P>
"The private sector has given donations but has not given real support by 
institutionalizing the holiday," Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
Most trading exchanges will operate as usual during the federal holiday. The 
New York Stock Exchange will hold a two-minute moment of silence on the trading 
floor at 11 a.m. This is an adequate sign of respect for a U.S. holiday in the 
era of global trading, said NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin. 
</P>
<P>
"Our market doesn't just serve New York, or the United States, it's an 
international exchange and should be available for investors around the world," 
said Gamsin.

MYTHOLOGY MIXES WITH HISTORY IN A BOLD TV SERIES ABOUT PRESLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ZURAWIK, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concept itself is pretty bold. A weekly, half-hour dramatic series about 
Elvis Presley. In fact, there has never been a weekly television series based 
on a contemporary real-life character. 
</P>
<P>
But in March, ABC will introduce "Elvis," starring Michael St. Gerard, with 
Priscilla Presley as an executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
ABC showed an episode of the series to critics recently, and the show is one of 
the most culturally fascinating pieces of television created in some time. 
</P>
<P>
The episode opens in Tupelo, Miss., in 1940. We see a young boy with big eyes 
looking up at a menacing sky. A storm's brewing. But it's more than a storm. It 
is the gods speaking. 
</P>
<P>
And then we see the boy's mother run out of their humble house to scoop him up 
in her arms and take him into a cellar where the two of them are going to ride 
out the storm in the dark, dank underground. More myth and symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
After this visual epigram, we're in Memphis, 1954, and Elvis is in the studios 
of Sun Records with Mr. (he's always called mister here) Sam Phillips, who is 
producing an Elvis recording session. 
</P>
<P>
We all know the story. Elvis is singing some drippy song, and Mr. Phillips is 
bummed. Mr. Phillips tells Elvis to take a break. Scotty and Bill, the guitar 
and bass players, tell "E" (that's what some in the inner circle called Elvis) 
to cut loose and play his real music. And Elvis starts singing Arthur "Big Boy" 
Crudup's "That's All Right, Mama." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Phillips hears it, runs back into the control room, turns on the recording 
machine and the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter that we've seen so many versions of this scene that we know 
not only what's going to happen but also what the main players are going to say 
before they speak. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that's the point. That's part of what makes it real mythology. 
</P>
<P>
The myth here is a blue-collar one. The rest of the preview episode shows Elvis 
struggling at his job loading trucks at Crown Electric in Memphis and studying 
for the electrician's exam in a delivery truck parked outside a nightclub on 
Beale Street. 
</P>
<P>
All this happens before Mr. Phillips gets Elvis' record played on WHBQ radio 
and everyone in Memphis starts hearing the name Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
St. Gerard mainly sat at the critic's press conference looking a lot like the 
young Elvis. Occasionally, he said things like, "I just hope I'm doing justice 
to Elvis' genius." It seemed to be what is called practiced humility. 
</P>
<P>
The first season will deal only with Elvis in the early 1950s. "This has always 
been my favorite period of Elvis," said co-producer Jerry Schilling. "This was 
Elvis as Marlon Brando and James Dean. . . ."

cast of "Les Miserables" got caught with its pants down when costumes from one 
scene in the musical were accidentally thrown in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes were placed in plastic trash bags Sunday to be taken to the 
cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
But an employee of the Benedum Center for Performing Arts, where the touring 
show of the Broadway musical is being performed, mistakenly added those bags to 
the theater's garbage, and all of it was taken to the dump on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Actors wear raggedy outfits typical of clothing worn by street rebels of the 
French Revolution. The wardrobe director, Jerry Wolf, confirmed Wednesday that 
the costumes -- worth about $50,000 -- were discarded inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
The show went on as scheduled without the costumes, and replacement clothing 
has been sent from New York.

STING LOBBIES FOR BRAZIL INDIANS

British pop star Sting met Brazilian President Jose Sarney on Wednesday for the 
second time in less than a year to lobby for the nation's Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Kaiapo Indian chief Raoni, with whom he toured the globe to 
raise funds last year, Sting asked that lands be demarcated for the Kaiapo 
tribe in the Amazon state of Para. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting at the presidential palace, Sting told Reuters that he would 
tell Sarney that he was also concerned about the fate of the Yanomami Indian 
tribe in the state of Roraima. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanomami are the biggest forest tribe left in the Americas, but the 7,000 
who live in Roraima are dying from malaria and other diseases brought there by 
some 40,000 gold prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell him (the president) the killing of the Yanomami must stop," Sting 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Brazil announced that the government had negotiated a peaceful 
departure of the prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
Sting last year founded the Foundation Mata Virgem (Virgin Forest) with a view 
to preserving the Amazon rain forest and its native people. His spokesmen said 
the singer had raised more than $1 million for the cause during his travels.

HERE'S A big scoop coming from Esquire in its February issue. The magazine that 
once used to be "for men" but now is for all the sexes, has put fiction on its 
cover for the first time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Editor Lee Eisenberg is crowing over a new short novel by Philip Roth, titled 
"Deception." They do say behind the scenes that there'll be lots of guessing as 
to the identities of the protagonists -- a man and his mistress in a London 
hotel room. The man is called Philip, as a matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Roth himself, who lives in New York with actress Claire Bloom, did not like it 
that Esquire speculates somewhat mildly in the magazine's introduction of his 
book as to who the real-life subjects might be. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Roth, that very autobiographical author, says fiction is fiction. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about the TV Hall of Fame taping festivities which will 
appear on the Fox network come Jan. 24. Here was an evening of honors and fun 
and the biggest names in Hollywood. Things were sailing along with the top 
peers of the entertainment realm having a ball. It was a dream until Milton 
Berle appeared to introduce honors for Perry Como. Milton couldn't read the 
teleprompter and his moments stretched out into unbearable minutes. Finally, he 
introduced Frank Sinatra, who came on sounding as if he had swallowed a shot 
glass. Sinatra couldn't read the teleprompter either and this again elongated 
the segments. Backstage, Fox's Barry Diller was pacing frantically and the 
producers -- Dwight Hemion and Gary Smith -- were having kittens. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Como arrived to save the day. But he couldn't read the teleprompter 
either and proceeded to drone on for what seemed like ages, reading lists of 
the names of everybody who had ever helped him since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
It will be fascinating to see how Fox edits this portion of the dazzling 
evening for the TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE ALSO talking about "Miss Manners," aka Judith Martin, and her 
devastating New York Times review of the new Michael Thomas novel about Wall 
Street, "Hanover House." Judith came right out and said it was an anti-Semitic 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, author Thomas has his own saucy Observer column in which to defend 
himself and he equates his famous reviewer, the etiquette queen, with having 
WASP values that would do justice to Edith Wharton while being a rather 
super-sensitive Jewish person herself. Oh, my -- another feud. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, read "Hanover House" with its whopping great cast of characters and 
its financial sturm und drang over the decades and decide for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
PAULETTE GODDARD, one of the most adorable of all "The Women" ever to come down 
the movie pike, has sold her famous Diego Rivera portrait, done in Mexico in 
the early '40s, and she received $220,000 for it. This leads some to speculate 
that the 87-year-old Miss G is "broke." But I'll bet she has diamond bracelets 
she hasn't even worn yet.

ONLY DEATH COULD PUT AN END TO RUN OF BRONKO NAGURSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY POVICH, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a memory, undimmed by the passage of 52 years, of the worst mismatch 
these eyes ever beheld. This was in Chicago's Wrigley Field on Dec. 12, 1937. 
Bears vs. the Redskins in the NFL title game. First quarter, the Bears behind 
by 7-0 and lusting for the tying touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears were deep in Redskin territory and in these circumstances, with the 
Redskins' defense running out of yardage, Sammy Baugh moved up from his usual 
safety position to middle linebacker. The Bears, of course, would give the ball 
to Bronko Nagurski. The rail-thin, 6-foot-2, 175-pound Baugh in the Redskins' 
last line of defense against a Nagurski charge? What a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Nagurski, 230 pounds of shoulders and high knee-action, did not trample Baugh. 
He lowered his head and gored him. Flung him high in the air and out of the 
vicinity, getting the Bears the big first down they needed, unimpeded by the 
Redskins' middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Nagurski died at 81, his place in both college and professional 
football firmly fixed. Probably no football player ever commanded so many 
superlatives, and in this appreciation of the Bronk, may I ask to be indulged 
to digress for a moment to relive that Redskins glory day in 1937 when the 
rookie Sammy Baugh beat the Bears for the title, 28-21, flicking touchdown 
passes of 55, 78 and 35 yards? 
</P>
<P>
For all his fame as a quarterback, Baugh wasn't a quarterback then. He was 
throwing the passes and doing the punting as the team's tailback in the 
double-wing system. Riley Smith, on the flank, called the signals. But Baugh 
often operated on his own. So with the Redskins huddled in their end zone early 
in the game, they heard him say, "We're a-goin' in punt formation but we're 
really gonna pass." He took the snap and threw 55 yards to Cliff Battles to 
launch the first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But this week belongs to Bronko Nagurski. There are many remembered examples of 
his fame, as once were listed in the book "Sports Immortals." "When you tackle 
the Bronk, it's like an electric shock. If you hit him above the ankles, you 
could get killed," Red Grange said. 
</P>
<P>
It was put another way by fellow hall-of-famer Ernie Nevers: "Tackling Bronko 
is like tackling a freight train going downhill." In the pros, Steve Owen, 
whose New York Giants were often wrecked by Nagurski's charges, suggested his 
formula for dealing with the Bronk. "The only way to stop Nagurski is shoot him 
before he leaves the dressing room." 
</P>
<P>
The version of Nagurski's power that I liked best was the comment of his 
college coach, Bernie Bierman of Minnesota, whose team was en route to a road 
game by railroad. When that train suddenly braked hard and came to a jolting 
stop, Bierman exclaimed, "My God, Nagurski has tackled the train." 
</P>
<P>
Nagurski's fame led to fantasy. It was a college football scout who first told 
how he was recruited: "Driving by, I saw this powerful young man plowing a 
field. Then I noticed he had a plow but no horse. I asked him directions to a 
certain town, and he pointed in the opposite direction -- with the plow in his 
left hand." 
</P>
<P>
Nagurski came out of Rainy River, Ontario, moving to International Falls, 
Minn., with his Polish-Ukrainian family at an early age. He lost his given name 
of Bronislaus when a teacher, perplexed by his mother's broken accent, 
simplified his name by entering it as Bronko. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bears, Nagurski was the symbol of the Monsters of the Midway, the team 
that dominated the NFL for nearly a decade, with one winning streak of 18 
games. He alternated at fullback and tackle, often playing both positions in 
the same game, as he had in college. 
</P>
<P>
During his last two years in college, he was a near-unanimous all-American, and 
in 1929 he received the ultimate reward from the New York Sun, which allotted 
him two places on its all-America team that year as fullback and tackle. 
Eventually, he was named to the college and the professional halls of fame. 
</P>
<P>
For all his size and power, Nagurski was a gentle, sensitive soul off the 
field, and in 1937 he quit the Bears, offended by George S. Halas' failure to 
raise his $5,000 salary, the same figure he was paid in 1930. He was persuaded 
to try pro wrestling, for which he was unsuited, but he was quickly made a 
world champion by the wrestling folks in the manner that they do such things. 
Fact is, some of the old pro wrestlers worked hard to keep from pinning down 
this novice. In 1943, he returned to the Bears for one more season. 
</P>
<P>
During his later years, Nagurski returned to Minnesota, working as a fishing 
guide and later owning a service station. It was long after 872 carries of the 
football in the toughest company in the world, and after leading the blocking 
for Beattie Feathers when that chap set the NFL rushing record of 1,004 yards, 
that Bronko, at 70, announced that he was retiring. "My legs started bothering 
me," he said.

NBA HOLDS KEY TO MATCH-UP OF MAGIC, MICHAEL

<P>
Promoters are hoping for a one-on-one match-up of basketball giants Michael 
Jordan and Magic Johnson, but NBA officials could foul the deal by withholding 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The players, Jordan for the Chicago Bulls and Johnson for the Lakers, have 
already agreed to the battle of the giants. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Jordan and Johnson have met periodically with the NBA and 
the players' association and remain optimistic that they will approve the 
charity event, scheduled tentatively for the last week in June, said Ross 
Levinsohn, a New York-based spokesman for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last meeting with the NBA and players' association was last Thursday," 
Levinsohn said. "We've been in semi-constant contact." 
</P>
<P>
But the NBA remains tight-lipped about whether it intends to approve the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"An event such as this -- like any other basketball-related exhibition -- 
requires approval by the NBA and the players' association," said NBA spokesman 
Terry Lyons in a telephone interview Wednesday from New York. "This event has 
not been approved by either." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said a player's contract "specifically states that any basketball event 
or competition has to be approved by the NBA and the players' association. From 
my understanding, the players' association isn't behind this and the NBA isn't 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I don't know where the next 18 months will take us." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Grantham, executive director of the players' association, said, "We are 
looking at the proposal, and we will make a decision at some point in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
The one-on-on would consist of two 15-minute halves to be broadcast on pay TV 
by Choice Entertainment of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The winner would receive $1 million, with any additional money going to 
charities of the players' choices, Levinsohn said.
