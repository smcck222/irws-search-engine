'TEACHERS TAKE EXTRA DUTIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Rich Connell's article on teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed almost no women and no elementary teachers were mentioned as earning 
large salaries. The opportunity to earn extra income is significantly less in 
elementary schools. Few elementary teachers can teach inter-session or summer 
school as we do in secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
I would suspect that the majority of women teachers have family obligations 
that would make most of these extra paid assignments impossible. Considering 
the fact that 71% of LAUSD teachers are women, this system takes on an element 
of sexist discrimination. It appears that the few extra assignments that are 
available are mainly for male secondary teachers. 
</P>
<P>
This article is misleading by giving the impression that any teacher who is, as 
school Board President Roberta Weintraub says, "really entrepreneurial" can 
earn $60,000 to $70,000 per year. It makes those of us who don't, look like a 
bunch of unmotivated goof-offs. The truth is that few teachers have the 
opportunity to get the additional paid assignments. Many more, including 
myself, don't have the time or energy for extra paid assignments after 
preparing for, teaching and evaluating five classes of 38 or 39 students per 
day. Additionally, teachers are then required to attend a couple of faculty 
meetings per week, open house and back to school night; compute and write 
progressive reports and report cards; call parents, and supervise students. 
This all adds up to more than a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that only .007% of the teachers in LAUSD earn $70,000 or more is 
evidence that the opportunity to earn that amount is very small. Do you really 
think that so few teachers would opt to earn $70,000 per year if the 
opportunity was really there? 
</P>
<P>
Teachers should not be expected to work night, day and weekends to earn a 
living wage in Los Angeles.

'TEACHERS TAKE EXTRA DUTIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This morning, on one of my so-called vacation days, I went to my school to fill 
out a stolen property report. My room had been broken into, again, and $1,100 
worth of my own personal property was taken in addition to $2,200 worth of 
school property. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15 years that I have taught at Kennedy High School my room has been 
broken into and/or vandalized five times, twice in the last two months. Last 
year, while I stayed after school to help some students, my car was stolen by a 
student. In past years I have suffered a fractured rib after having been 
knocked down by an automobile in the student parking lot, and in a separate 
incident I was bitten by a student. Although I am quite aware that there is a 
large segment of our society that receives a lower annual salary than that of a 
teacher, for some reason, at this particular moment, my present teacher's 
salary just doesn't look all that great. 
</P>
<P>
How many of your readers, other than policemen, can document job experiences 
such as my own? My college education has done little to prepare me for the 
realities of teaching (drug and alcohol abuse, pregnancy, broken homes, child 
abuse, parents who don't care) that I have to deal with on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
I would hope that all of this would not lead you to believe that all teachers 
have the same job experiences as myself. Most teachers are able to teach their 
whole careers without any outside problems, yet, I know for a fact that many 
teachers have had to endure hardships far greater than my own.

RULING ON FIRED WORKERS' SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've said all along that Gov. George Deukmejian used the death penalty issue as 
a smoke screen to get rid of the (former California Chief Justice) Rose Bird 
court. The proof was on the front page Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry wanted the Rose Bird court out, because the justices 
were upholding the awards by juries to citizens who were injured on the job, 
etc., or who were fired unlawfully, etc. By eliminating the punitive awards for 
their injuries, it makes it almost impossible for an attorney to take such 
cases, as his fee has always been a percentage of that award. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the voters will wise up and realize that Deukmejian is no friend. They 
voted out of office probably the best friends they ever had in the Bird court. 
</P>
<P>
Remember these names. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas; Justices Edward Panelli, 
John Arguelles and David Eagleson. 
</P>
<P>
They are Deukmejian's appointees, and when they come up on the ballot for 
confirmation vote them out of office.

RULING ON FIRED WORKERS' SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pared to essentials, the California Supreme Court decision in the Foley case 
("Justices Limit Damages in Fired Workers' Suits," Part I, Dec. 30) says to 
fired employees: 
</P>
<P>
1. You still can sue and collect punitive damages from an employer who fires 
you because you "whistle-blow," won't break a law or take some other action 
that benefits the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
2. You don't need a written contract to sue an ex-employer for failing to keep 
promises, whether they're express or implied, but your damages will be limited 
to back pay or reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
Wrongful termination still lives in the law, even though the court has refused 
to protect employees from "bad faith" contract abuse. That's reserved only for 
those who sue insurance companies.

THE SAVINGS SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rising indignation of taxpayers over the burden that they will bear in 
bailing out failed savings-and-loan institutions, and probably a number of 
banks as well, is understandable. The public has been betrayed by a culpability 
that runs from dilatory regulators and complacent bureaucrats in the executive 
branch of the federal government to a Congress eager to please the politically 
powerful masters of the thrift and banking industries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there will be an inescapable cost of close to $100 billion that 
the taxpayers themselves will now be forced to pay over the next three or four 
years. The cost is inescapable because the good faith of the government must 
protect, within the prescribed limits of the law, the depositors placed at risk 
by the profligate mismanagement of so many thrifts and banks. 
</P>
<P>
That outrageous cost may be just the beginning. Nothing that the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board has done to address the crisis in the savings-and-loan industry 
is a remedy for the underlying problem. Indeed, critical elements of the 
generous and virtually risk-free deals being struck by the board with private 
investors, ostensibly to cut the cost to taxpayers for the rescue mission, 
raise a flood of questions about their equity and about the real commitment of 
the new investors to reform and a long-term role. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, both Congress and the Reagan White House, through the Council of 
Economic Advisers, have been so busy blaming others that they have ignored 
their own glaring responsibility, including the responsibility to come up with 
real reforms. More, much more than a clean-up of management, is required. 
</P>
<P>
Time is wasting. Even as regulators and legislators rush to their own defense, 
the problem is getting worse. Some of the FHLBB interventions have eased the 
interest rates that thrift institutions have to pay for new money. But they 
have not deterred a continued, perilous mounting of more liabilities at a time 
when the loans made by the troubled institutions already exceed the valuation 
of the projects for which they were made in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The collaboration of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. officials with 
megabuck bailout investors in the final days of December, to assure these 
investors a maximum tax benefit before the law changed on Jan. 1, raises 
serious questions for Congress to pursue. Federal regulators argue that these 
midnight deals were in the public interest. They also point out that they were 
given few options because FSLIC reserves had fallen to only a fraction of the 
obligations to depositors. It is now for Congress to find out whether the right 
thing was done. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress itself will be ignoring the public interest if it fails to do more 
than conduct noisy hearings. This is not a Republican-Democratic partisan 
issue. The deregulation that is at the heart of the crisis was voted by 
Congress in the Carter Administration, then reinforced in the subsequent Reagan 
years. It would be ridiculous to maintain any federal role, any deposit 
insurance, unless regulations are restored to minimize the risks.To do 
otherwise would be to force taxpayers to pick up the losses of a financial 
sector more akin to a casino than the prudent institutions envisioned when 
deposit insurance was invented. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Congress must look sharply at the decision of the FHLBB that its 
function is to save the industry, not just to protect those with deposits up to 
the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Perhaps it is cheaper to reorganize 
failing institutions rather than to padlock their doors and pay off depositors. 
But Congress needs to know who this grand scheme will benefit beyond the 
insured depositors and the traditional customers of mortgage money. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has elicited expressions of outrage from the savings-and-loan 
institutions that are well managed and in strong condition. But their protests 
had been muted until Congress raised the prospect that all of the industry will 
have to bear an increased share in the costs of finding remedies, of 
refinancing the FSLIC. We see no alternative to continuing and probably 
enlarging the special FSLIC assessment paid by all savings-and-loans. That need 
not preclude introducing a risk-related supplementary insurance premium for the 
institutions that might choose to continue dubious investments. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the savings-and-loan crisis takes center stage, unresolved problems are 
being compounded in the banking industry. The new federal budget includes 
warnings about the risky rush of major banks to fund leveraged buyouts of 
businesses -- a highly profitable venture only so long as economic growth is 
maintained and recession is avoided. 
</P>
<P>
A sensitive issue dims the likelihood of effective action on Capitol Hill. That 
is the cozy relationship between so many in Congress, including the leadership, 
and the thrift industry, which has been politically and financially helpful to 
them. There will be a temptation to continue coddling the industry at a time 
when it needs a reassertion of stringent controls. There will be a reluctance 
to reassess whether, in fact, savings-and-loan institutions should continue to 
have a protected place in the American economy today, long after they have 
diversified so broadly from their historic function of providing mortgages for 
home and commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
In facing this crisis, Congress needs to remember what the public interest is. 
There is no public obligation to bail out investors, to reduce the risk of 
those rushing in with new money, to protect failed managers, to guard the 
stockholders of mismanaged companies. The public obligation is to protect the 
depositors within the limits of the law. And to see that it doesn't happen 
again.

TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY B. EPSTEIN, Jerry B. Epstein, one of the original developers of the 
county's Marina del Rey,is the chairman of the county Energy Commission and the 
vice president of the Board of Airport Commissioners. 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Imagine if New Jersey did not have a governor. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine if companies like Coca-Cola and Pacific Telesis had no chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Now imagine an enterprise with 75,000 employees, serving 8 million people, with 
a $9-billion budget -- and no chief executive. Unbelievable? Not for Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are more residents in Los Angeles County than in 41 states, yet 
there is no single elected official who can speak for this entity here at home 
or in Sacramento or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Today the County of Los Angeles has an annual budget higher than those of 31 
states. It provides services to the public through 35 independent departments 
and takes the advice of nearly 200 citizen commissions, yet there is no single 
elected official who is accountable for the executive functions of county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
This is no way to run a company, or a government. And, as our county's growth 
accelerates, the situation deteriorates every day. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted in inefficiencies instigated by an 
administrative system rife with bureaucratic end runs to five different 
supervisors divided as often by personal animosity as by political philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Human tragedies occur daily because of the bureaucratic paralysis. A pathetic 
example is the inexplicable division of the domestic-violence and child-abuse 
administrative functions between two entirely separate departments. 
</P>
<P>
The system is broken, and it needs fixing. In Los Angeles County, five 
supervisors -- each of whom represents 1.6 million people -- hold executive, 
legislative and quasi-judicial power in their collective hands, contrary to the 
system of checks and balances that is the hallmark of American democracy. They 
have been called kings, and they preside over their districts as if Los Angeles 
County were a collection of five fiefdoms. And, in defiance of our country's 
most cherished principle and a Justice Department order, the five are refusing 
to revise their boundaries so that the county's Latino population, which is 
fast growing toward majority status, might have representation. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago the voters of Los Angeles County narrowly defeated an initiative 
to establish a county executive, or mayor. Given that the reform-minded 
proponents of the initiative -- supported by Common Cause, the League of Women 
Voters, the Bar Assn. and the Los Angeles Times, among others -- spent only a 
few thousand dollars and came so close to their objective, it seemed only a 
matter of time before the status quo crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the entrenched interests held fast, and the prospect for 
efficient government is bleaker today than ever before. Our problems mount, and 
regional solutions are demanded, yet the supervisors go about their business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
The county budget is twice the size that it was in 1978, 20 times the size of 
the 1960 budget. Our transportation system is gridlocked -- in fact, held 
hostage by one supervisor determined to control every bus in his district. Our 
solid and toxic wastes accumulate while the supervisors lack the political will 
to find a suitable site to locate a new disposal zone. The numbers of homeless 
and AIDS victims increase. Yet the Board of Supervisors cannot even agree on a 
simple efficiency like consolidating some of the county's 50 warehouses, let 
alone make the tough decisions to improve -- or even maintain -- our present 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
More distressing still, there appears to be no "light at the end of the 
tunnel." As recent elections demonstrated, it is nearly impossible to unseat 
incumbent legislators at any level of government, most of whom have stockpiled 
campaign funds to insulate them effectively from electoral challenge. Despite 
the widespread concern about the inadequacies of the present system, the cost 
of mounting a county executive initiative today would be prohibitive. Even to 
get the measure on the ballot, before the voters, would require incalculable 
resources to neutralize the supervisors' political and financial power to block 
it. 
</P>
<P>
So Los Angeles County seems destined to face the future without an independent 
and organized executive branch of government, and without a single spokesperson 
for the interests of all the people of the county. 
</P>
<P>
There is a political adage that "all politics is local." We in Los Angeles 
County suffer daily because of the dilemmas created by parochial politics. In 
the decade since the voters last had the chance to speak, Proposition 13 has 
squeezed local governments, and the problems associated with an aging and 
overburdened infrastructure have escalated. Still, our "local" supervisors, 
each of whom represents a population equal to that of almost 20 of our nation's 
states, wield unchallenged authority, turning one problem after another over 
for "further study" without accountability to any other branch of government or 
to the people. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is all but immobilized. What kind of crisis will it take to 
energize our community to bring county government into the 21st Century?

GOV. DEUKMEJIAN NEEDS TO MEET THE NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
A KINDER CLIMATE FOR ALL WHO LIVE HERE IS ACHIEVABLE -- IT'S A MATTER OF CARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. WOOD, Father William J. Wood, S.J., is the executive director of 
the California Catholic Conference in Sacramento. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One has every reason to admire and take seriously Gov. George Deukmejian's 
commitment during the last two years of his Administration to find a window 
through which a star of hope and opportunity will shine for all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
His search for that star should be kicked off with a reality tour of the state, 
beginning with visits to the persons and communities to which the window of 
opportunity has been tightly shut over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's State of the State address and his speech on the presentation of 
the new state budget confirm the need for such a reality tour. Once again the 
glaring absence of any mention of those suffering from homelessness in this 
state gives evidence that Deukmejian -- for all his obvious sincerity, 
dedication and good will -- simply does not know the rich diversity of the 
people of California whom he sincerely wants to serve. If he is to develop a 
budget plan "that is balanced, fair and compassionate to all Californians," he 
needs to move into the community and get to know his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial itinerary should include at least one shelter for the 
homeless, a detention center for illegal aliens and a center for persons with 
AIDS -- perhaps the Star Cross Community for abandoned babies with AIDS in 
Sonoma County, where he could learn firsthand about the second phase of this 
disease. He needs to come into contact with the inner city and the rural poor, 
to chat with people in unemployment lines and in agricultural labor camps. 
Prisons would be an important stop, especially San Quentin's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Such a tour, if seriously undertaken, could change information into real 
knowledge, putting faces and names on disturbing facts and figures. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian might be pleasantly surprised to find not only problems and needs in 
the community but also the tremendous inner resources of the people of 
California, from the newest immigrants to native Americans. He will not be 
alone in his newborn approach. There are numerous church-based and secular 
social-service agencies and community organizations that have been grappling 
with the problems, often ignored by the governor, for a long time. They would 
welcome his leadership. The good and generous people of California need to hear 
their governor, by his example, challenge them all to place the public interest 
over private gain. 
</P>
<P>
One must also hope that Deukmejian will be moved to reconsider some of the 
policies that he has championed. Has not the emphasis on capital punishment and 
a tough law-and-order rhetoric, for example, distracted us from getting at the 
real issues of criminal justice? 
</P>
<P>
Farm policies bear close reevaluation, too. The dismantling of the Agricultural 
Labor Relations Act has been one of the meanest and most senseless actions of 
this Administration. Monterey County officials report that living conditions 
for farm workers there were worse in 1988 than at any time since the Great 
Depression. The policy bias toward the concentration of land ownership and the 
industrialization of agriculture has created poverty and health hazards in 
rural communities while scuttling the institution of family farming and 
destroying the land for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
At root we face a crisis of values. And it is the values that we commit 
ourselvesto that will determine how the issues will be resolved. We must 
recover in public policy the values that mean so much in our private lives -- 
selfless care for others,a sense of justice, a recognition of the intrinsic 
worth, dignity and potential of every human being, a sense of responsibility 
and reverence for Mother Earth. What is wrong in California is that misplaced 
economic and cultural values are bolstering a system that is tilted toward the 
benefit of the already wealthy and powerful at the inevitable expense of the 
most vulnerable. The challenge of leadership for Deukmejian is to help us 
rediscover America's values. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of his 1988 book, "Family Farming: A New Economic Vision," 
Marty Strange recalls a scene from Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." It 
offers a lesson from the Industrial Revolution that Deukmejian, and 
Californians in general, might well take to heart. The Spirit of 
Christmas-Yet-to-Come leads the terrorized Ebenezer Scrooge to his own marker 
in a desolate, overgrown and debris-strewn cemetery. For all his mean avarice, 
we feel for him and wish that he could do something to avoid this fate as he 
sobs out, "Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point, answer me one 
question. Are these the shadows of thethings that will be, or are they shadows 
of the things that may be only? Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to 
which, if persevered in, they must lead. But if the courses be departed from, 
the ends must change. Say it is thus with what you show me!" 
</P>
<P>
Whether we have a gentler, kinder California for all who live here is not a 
matter of fate. It is a matter of caring. It is a matter of political will. It 
is a matter of enlightened leadership. Gov. Deukmejian, you have two more 
years.

Westchester 77, University 56 -- The Comets have undergone the transition from 
a poor shooting team at the beginning of the season to a squad that's on fire 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester shot 55% from the field Wednesday at University and broke open the 
game in the second half to record the victory. Earlier this season the Comets 
shot under 30% in two tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
Center Zan Mason paced Westchester with 19 points and 10 rebounds, Renaud 
Gordon scored 17 points and grabbed 11 boards, and Sam Crawford contributed 11 
points and handed out 9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester improved to 9-3 overall and 2-0 in Coastal Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance 61, Palos Verdes 41 -- Rick Robison scored a game-high 24 points to 
lift the Tartars to a Bay League victory at home. Toby Waller contributed 15 
and Art Terrell chipped in with 11 for Torrance (8-5 overall and 3-0 in 
league). Palos Verdes (3-8, 1-2) was paced by Ian Chatfield's 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 71, Bosco Tech 69 -- Despite the absence of 6-10 center Ed Stokes, 
who missed the game because of the flu, the Vikings won because Mark Raveling 
(27 points) and Terrell Steen (19) tossed in career highs in the Camino Real 
contest. St. Bernard (13-2 overall and 3-0 in league play) missed 12 free 
throws in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw 111, San Pedro 65 -- Bigger, stronger and deeper is how Pirates Coach 
Jack Kordich described Crenshaw, and the Cougars proved it Wednesday afternoon 
in a Southern Pacific Conference game at San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Bad enough to have to face the powerful Cougars with a full complement, but the 
Pirates had to play with one of their best players, Willie Sanchez, ailing with 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez did score 18 points, but all in the first half, while John Wells led 
all San Pedro scorers with 23. 
</P>
<P>
"We just ran out of gas," Kordich said. "Then I looked up and saw their 
substitutions and couldn't tell the difference between them and the guys that 
were coming out. They are so good." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro fell to 5-6 overall and 0-2 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey 62, Banning 52 -- Banning was moving along nicely, holding onto an 
8-point halftime lead, until Dorsey stormed back with a strong second half to 
secure the Southern Pacific Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots (7-8 overall and 0-2 in conference play) were paced by Chris 
Waller's 18 points while James Floyd yanked down a game-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Carson 76, Gardena 65 -- In one afternoon at Carson, the Colts avenged an 
earlier loss to the Mohicans and kept their Southern Pacific Conference record 
unblemished at 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Carson (8-5 overall and 2-0 in conference) led throughout and opened a 20-point 
lead with 1:59 remaining in the third quarter. But before the blowout could 
materialize, Gardena came roaring back and cut the lead to 51-42 with more than 
7 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts again forged a comfortable margin midway through the final period, 
and, after Sandy Davis and Vince Washington knocked down consecutive baskets, 
they led 64-51. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mohicans kept coming back and cut the lead to 66-60 when Darryl 
MacMillan scored off Cedric Williams' steal on an inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
Carson then cooly made the free throws it needed when the game was on the line 
and secured the win. 
</P>
<P>
Washington led all scorers with 21 points and Davis came off the bench to knock 
down 14, including 8 in the decisive final period. Ray Bennett scored 15 and 
N'Cosie Littleton contributed 10. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (10-5 and 1-1) was paced by MacMillan, who scored 20 points (11 in the 
final period) while Williams chipped in 19, including four 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Gardena edged Carson, 70-69, in the Artesia Tournament.

LISA LESLIE; 
</P>
<P>
SHE'S A CHARMER WITH A WARM SMILE AND BUBBLY PERSONALITY MOST OF THE TIME, BUT 
ON THE COURT SHE'S A TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sitting down, Lisa Leslie hardly looks the intimidating type. With her warm 
smile, stunning brown eyes and youthful exuberance, she could easily have been 
the inspiration for Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little 16." 
</P>
<P>
But that impression quickly changes when the Morningside High School junior 
takes the basketball court. Then it's easy to see how Leslie could strike fear 
in opponents. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-5, she would be considered tall on a boys basketball team. Against high 
school girls, most under 6 feet, she looms like a giant. 
</P>
<P>
She earned the nickname "Dunkin" for doing exactly that against Manual Arts in 
Morningside's season opener, becoming the first girl to slam dunk in a high 
school game and only the second to perform the feat in the history of U.S. 
women's basketball, according to scout Len Locher. 
</P>
<P>
And her exceptional skills are only part of her arsenal. She can gain an edge 
with mere presence. 
</P>
<P>
Although she says she never intentionally tries to intimidate an opponent, 
Leslie admits she'll go for the jugular if she senses fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell when people are intimidated," she said. "They start to look at each 
other. Whenever I see a weakness, that's when I feel it's time for me to take 
over because they're scared of me." 
</P>
<P>
It was Leslie's presence that spelled doom for Redondo in last Friday's Ocean 
League game at Morningside. After she scored three straight baskets in the 
opening minutes, Redondo center Vanessa Vogelsang came to the bench during a 
timeout and reportedly told Coach Tim Ammentorp: "I can't play against her." 
Ammentorp, upset with her attitude, benched Vogelsang for the rest of the game 
as the Lady Monarchs romped to a 77-11 win. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2 Vogelsang entered the game averaging 25.3 points, tops in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie intimidated everybody in the gym," Ammentorp said. "We had people get 
their shot blocked and immediately look to throw it out (of the key). We had 
people who didn't want to bring the ball up court. There were people open, but 
we wouldn't throw it because Leslie was standing there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a girl who can dominate the game as she does." 
</P>
<P>
Locher, director of Western Girls Athletic Services, rates Leslie the 
third-best high school girl ever to play in Southern California behind former 
prep All-Americans Cheryl Miller (Riverside Poly) and Teri Mann (Point Loma). 
</P>
<P>
That's elite company. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, considered by many the finest women's player ever, starred at USC and 
led the U.S. to the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics. She holds Southern Section 
records for most points in a career (3,446), most in a season (1,197) and most 
in a game (105). Mann, a burly center nicknamed "Baby Moses" (after Moses 
Malone), guided Point Loma of the CIF San Diego Section to an unprecedented 
four straight state titles in 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
"She's improved a great deal over the last year," Locher said of Leslie. "Right 
now she's without a doubt the No. 1 underclassman in the country." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, translates into a tremendous amount of recruiting interest in 
the Morningside center. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to about three coaches almost every other day," Leslie said. "It 
doesn't bother me because if I don't want to talk, I won't." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who carries a solid 3.5 grade-point average, says USC, Stanford, 
Tennessee and Auburn are the colleges currently at the top of her list. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have a hard time keeping her out of the boys starting lineup," said Ron 
Randle, co-coach of the Morningside boys team. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's success is part God-given, part hard work. She gets her height from 
her parents. The late Bernard Leslie was 6-4 and Leslie's mother, Christine, is 
6-3. Both played basketball in high school. 
</P>
<P>
But to think that Leslie's talents are solely the result of heredity, is to 
make a mistake. Since the seventh grade she has spent long hours in the gyms of 
Carson and Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
She got her start in organized basketball on an otherwise all-boys team at 
Victoria Park in Carson. As a 12-year-old seventh-grader she was 6-2 and the 
tallest member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I towered over everybody," Leslie recalled. "All of the guys were about 5-8. 
They knew me from shooting around. They would always say, 'Hey Lisa, want to 
play with us?' So I played with them. I got put on a team and I didn't know 
what to expect at first. But it wasn't hard to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
First, though, she had to earn the respect of her male teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played my first game, they wouldn't give me the ball," she said. "The 
coach had to tell them, 'Hey, give Lisa the ball.' They got me the ball and we 
won." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was named most valuable player of the team, the first of many honors to 
come her way. 
</P>
<P>
A varsity starter as a freshman, she developed into a force near the basket for 
Morningside last season and was named to the All-CIF Southern Section 4-A first 
team after averaging 21.3 points, 12.2 rebounds and 6.1 blocked shots. Her play 
helped the Lady Monarchs to a 33-2 record, the 4-A and Southern California 
titles and the runner-up spot in the state Division I tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Out from under the shadow of graduated senior Shaunda Greene, last year's 4-A 
co-player of the year, Leslie entered this season on several All-American 
lists. She's fulfilling those expectations by averaging 24 points, 14 rebounds 
and 6 blocks. She was named MVP of all three tournaments the Lady Monarchs 
played in last month -- Morningside, Oakland Miramonte and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an all-around dominating figure right now," said Morningside Coach Frank 
Scott, whose team is 13-1, 3-0 in the Ocean League and is considered among the 
top 10 teams in the nation. "She's almost unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
Ammentorp, the Redondo coach, says he knew Leslie was headed for greatness 
during her freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer before her freshman year, my assistant coach said they've got a 
girl who's going to be an All-American," Ammentorp recalled. "And I said, 'Come 
on, coach. Let's get serious.' By the time the basketball season came around, I 
knew he was right. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaunda Greene was a great basketball player, but Lisa is so tall, she's such 
a force. You can't take the ball inside against her because she blocks it. She 
has amazing timing for somebody as young as she is. And you can't guard her 
because she turns and has nice touch around the basket. You have to have 
somebody who's almost her size to have any chance against her." 
</P>
<P>
Ammentorp believes Leslie's statistics would be more impressive if she did not 
play on a balanced team, one that includes heavily recruited senior guard Jo Jo 
Witherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
"If Lisa were on our team, she would probably score 50 points a game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie doesn't mind sharing the wealth with her teammates. Her primary goal is 
to return to the state Division I championship game and reverse last year's 
disappointing 53-52 loss to Oakland Fremont. The Lady Monarchs have not lost to 
a California team this season, their only defeat coming to highly regarded 
Southern High of Louisville, Ky., 52-50, in the final of the Santa Barbara 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see any team in California beating us," Leslie said. "If 
someone beats us, it's going to be a big upset." 
</P>
<P>
A loss in league play would go beyond the realm of an upset. It would be 
mind-boggling. Morningside has won 61 consecutive league games, most by 
lopsided margins. The Lady Monarchs' three Ocean League wins this season have 
been by 43, 66 and 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie complains that the easy competition sometimes makes it difficult to 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard because Coach Scott wants us to go out there with the same 
intensity as we would if it was a hard game. But it's hard for me to go in 
there and dominate if the girl isn't defending me very hard. We have to keep 
the intensity up in practice. Going against each other in practice is harder 
than the games we play." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie learned about grueling practices from her cousin, Craig Simpson, a 
former basketball player at Dorsey High. During eighth grade, Leslie says she 
spent nearly every night in the gym taking instructions from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd do my homework and then go to the gym," she said. "Working with my cousin 
is how I got my skills. I told him I liked basketball, and that was it. He made 
me do all kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
The regimen included conditioning drills: jumping rope, doing push-ups and 
sitting on a wall with her legs tucked up to strengthen stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember being upset and saying, 'I'm not going to do this anymore,' " she 
said. "And he'd say, 'Well, I'll tell you what. You can either do it or this is 
the end of your basketball career.' He wasn't going to let me come to the gym 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie stuck with it, and it paid dividends when she entered high school. 
Although she appears gangly, Leslie displays the skills of a conditioned 
athlete. She can post up inside, but she also handles the ball well for a big 
girl and has the quickness to defend guards. 
</P>
<P>
Locher says the combination of height and athletic ability are what make Leslie 
such an outstanding prospect. However, the scout says she needs to increase her 
bulk and strength. 
</P>
<P>
"She has to develop more of a physical game," he said. "She has trouble playing 
against more physical kids. It doesn't hurt her in high school, but on the 
college level she will have a rough time. She has trouble playing against 
pounders." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie figures she has time to prepare for college. After all, she still has 
more than half of her junior year remaining, a long summer of off-season 
basketball and her senior season to look forward to. She will try out for the 
Olympic Festival team in April, keeping her sights on making the 1992 Olympic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
And there's always the possibility she may grow another inch or two. That, she 
says, wouldn't upset her. Sure, she's been the target of teasing because of her 
height, but Leslie says she has never desired to be shorter. 
</P>
<P>
"It never bothered me because my mom is tall," she said. "My mother always told 
me, 'Someone is going to say something negative, but small minds you don't pay 
attention to.' I've been taller since kindergarten, so I've dealt with it my 
whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Now other basketball players are dealing with it. And coming up short.

Harbor 78, Trade Tech 71 -- Despite a 15-point halftime advantage, the Los 
Angeles Harbor College basketball team had to endure a fierce rally by the 
visiting Los Angeles Trade Tech Beavers to post a 78-71 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks remain unbeaten atop the Southern California Athletic Conference 
at 3-0, 10-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers came to within 3 points at 74-71 with 10 seconds remaining but 
could climb no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Billingslea scored a game-high 28 points for Harbor before fouling out 
late in the second half.

WestPoint Pepperell's first-quarter net income dropped 46% from a year ago to 
$11 million. Sales climbed to $683 million, up 42%. The West Point, Ga., maker 
of apparel, fabric and rugs attributed the results in part to special charges 
of $17 million for an enhanced early retirement program, a reserve to cover 
related expenses from the company's announced intention to move certain apparel 
support functions from Troy, N.Y., to locations in the South and expenses 
related to the unsolicited tender offer by Farley Inc.

ARCHITECTURE: HOPE SEEMS INSPIRED IN SEAPORT PLAN

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city has been arched, peach-stuccoed and tiled to death in the quest for 
the elusive "regional style." Awkward combinations of these elements are 
marching across the county like so many Stepford wives. 
</P>
<P>
The planned expansion of Seaport Village could rise above it. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by San Diego's Hope Architects &amp; Engineers, this new cousin of the 
existing Disneyland-style tourist mall will take its cues from the old police 
station on Market Street, a large part of which will form the heart of the new 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in the late 1930s, the station was one of the last projects from the 
offices of Quayle Brothers &amp; Treganza. Some of its ornate Spanish Colonial 
details -- especially on two entry arches and a tower -- make it one of the 
finer remaining San Diego buildings from the latter end of a romantic period in 
local architecture that began in 1915 with the richly detailed buildings in 
Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is this: Can we trust the Seaport Village developers, led by 
M. B. Taubman and Lee Stein, to come through with the commitment the project 
deserves? 
</P>
<P>
Such a commitment will mean dollars, probably tens of thousands, to give the 
project the detailing it needs. Otherwise, it will join the ranks of the local 
Stepford family, just another drone. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, one of the biggest local firms, isn't an obvious choice for the project. 
Its work, spanning 60 years in San Diego, has generally tended in recent years 
toward large, often disappointing corporate build 
</P>
<P>
ings. First National Bank, formerly Columbia Centre, at Columbia and B Streets, 
is one example. Its greatest single shortcoming is its failure to involve 
pedestrians at the street level, a problem that would be even more intolerable 
at people-oriented Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the Seaport addition, the firm made a conscious decision to steer 
clear of a slick, easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
At Hope's downtown offices recently, project architect Bruce Green brought out 
the firm's initial design, an attempt to contrast, rather than work with, the 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I thought we needed a glass pavilion or something out front, like 
I. M. Pei added to the Louvre," Green said, pointing out just such a bauble. 
But, during four years of design work, the approach shifted to one of 
harmonizing with the police buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The project looks inviting. Arched police station entries to be preserved on 
Market and Pacific Highway will send a romantic call to pedestrians. A new 
entry on Kettner Boulevard near Market (soon to become the realigned Harbor 
Drive) appears to mirror the existing architecture in scale and form, but Green 
said the detailing has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling that Green, who has historic-preservation background, would 
love to see authentic plaster-cast details applied. But such quality is rare in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
As for the inside of the project, it will emphasize shops and restaurants 
grouped around a large L-shaped courtyard the developers call their "Night 
Court." For one cover charge, patrons can do justice to a variety of 
restaurants and night spots, including a "jazz and blues club." 
</P>
<P>
Like the exterior decoration, the design details of the interior shop facades 
are still up for grabs. A soon-to-be-hired consultant will work with Hope on 
guidelines here. Inappropriate materials such as large commercial aluminum 
windows should be written out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Compliments go to the developers for including people-oriented elements in 
their project, such as a 300-seat open-air amphitheater, a new water's-edge 
Ferris wheel and the wonderful 1890 Looff carrousel, to be moved to a central 
location next to a new, man-made pond. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening along the waterfront has as much to do with the spaces between 
buildings as with the buildings themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment of Harbor Drive is just part of waterfront plans that also 
include the potentially stunning "linear park," now being created by landscape 
designers Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with local architects Austin Hansen 
Fehlman Group. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this long, narrow strip of landscaping and art, which will tie 
pedestrian, auto and trolley circulation neatly together, will extend down the 
new Harbor Drive nearly to the edge of the Seaport addition. 
</P>
<P>
Green said thick landscaping placed to camouflage the new parking garage and an 
extra-wide pedestrian strip at this corner will help relate Seaport Village to 
the linear park. 
</P>
<P>
Water figures prominently in the expansion. Taubman, founder and chairman of 
Seaport Village, has called the theme "water, water everywhere," including 
fountains and the new central pond by the carrousel. 
</P>
<P>
As for tying the project to the existing Seaport Village, the older complex 
doesn't have a thing to do with this '80s Spanish Colonial revisited, and it's 
a bit too theme-park-oriented anyhow. So scale, not style, will link the new 
Seaport to the old. The back of the addition will include smaller-massed 
buildings that open onto the pedestrian space behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Several fine old palms ring the police station, both singles and impressive 
clusters. Landscape architects ONA Inc. have recommended keeping them, which 
makes both historic and economic sense. According to Green, replacement 
groupings of six or so mature trees could cost $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are several good signs here. With this project, Hope has a chance to set 
an example for the other giant San Diego architectural firms. If the architects 
are sticklers for detail, and the developers don't balk at spending for 
quality, the project's completion sometime in 1992 could prove that it is 
possible for corporate-size architecture machines to turn out sensitive, 
human-scale projects.

MAGAZINES: PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON THE TABLOIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teen star Drew Barrymore's account of her drug and alcohol addiction in this 
week's People developed partly as a preemptive strike against the tabloid 
press, according to the reporter who interviewed the 13-year-old actress for 
the first-person account. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Gold of the magazine's Los Angeles bureau says that at least one tabloid 
writer was on Barrymore's trail, apparently after overhearing a comment in a 
studio commissary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Garbled Accounts 
</P>
<P>
"He heard someone say something like, 'Yeah, Drew can read (for a part) after 
she gets out of rehab,' " Gold explained, noting that tabloids did run short, 
garbled accounts of Barrymore's hospitalization. The tabloid reporter began 
staking out rehabilitation centers in the Los Angeles area and eventually 
spotted Barrymore's mother paying a visit to one, Gold added, noting that the 
tabloid type passed himself off as a medical professional. 
</P>
<P>
By picking a magazine that offered a first-person format, Barrymore, now free 
of drugs and alcohol, was assured that her story would be told her way, said 
Gold, who also collaborated with singer David Crosby for a similar article in 
April, 1987. Compared with the long lead times for other magazines, the fact 
that the weekly could do the story fast also was a plus, Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors played a role in getting the story for People, said Gold, who got 
a call from Barrymore's publicist -- and a friend of the reporter's -- 
proposing the story. The idea of giving an interview came from Barrymore's 
therapists who saw an up-front account as a way for the young actress to deal 
with public curiosity about her problems, Gold said. "From now on she can say, 
'Yes, I have a problem, I've talked about it' . . . and put it behind her," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost" Barrymore wanted to tell about her slide into drinking and 
cocaine abuse to 'help other kids,' " Gold said. The article is accompanied by 
an interview with an expert on juvenile alcoholism who said Barrymore's peers 
are "a depressed generation." The expert added, "Too many children feel that no 
one cares about them, and too many of them are right." 
</P>
<P>
Gold couldn't say whether the actress, best known for her roles in "E.T." and 
"Irreconcilable Differences," also might have picked People because she's a fan 
of the magazine. But he "saw a stack" of back issues at Barrymore's home, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrymore's narrative of her nightmare seems to pull no punches. She admits to 
taking her first drink at age 9, smoking marijuana at 10 and using cocaine at 
12. She has been through two drug rehabilitation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I became famous in 'E.T.,' my life got really weird," Barrymore 
told People. "One day I was a little girl, and the next day I was being mobbed 
by people who wanted me to sign my autograph or pose for pictures or who just 
wanted to touch me. . . . I was this 7-year-old who was expected to be going on 
a mature 29." 
</P>
<P>
Following a relapse, Barrymore says she took a credit card from her mother's 
purse and flew from New York to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"In L.A., we went to my house, blasted the stereo and decided to take my 
mother's BMW to go out to dinner," Barrymore recalled. "Even though I'm 13, my 
driving is pretty good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Stacy and I drove around Hollywood for awhile. At one point we were being 
tailed by a cop, which was frightening because we had the coke on the 
dashboard. But once we got out of that, we went shopping. By that time my 
mother had reported the credit card stolen, but we still managed to buy several 
hundred dollars' worth of clothes by conning the sales people." 
</P>
<P>
Since the magazine appeared Monday, Gold said he has received a number of calls 
about the story, including one from a mother interested in finding treatment 
for her daughter and three from book publishers interested in publishing the 
teen-ager's life story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit on the Bloom 
</P>
<P>
If this is April it must be strawberries -- on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the thinking behind California Food, a monthly set to debut this spring 
as a sort of hybrid -- a trade publication with consumer appeal. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by Stan Jones, executive director of the California Commission 
for Food and Wines, the glossy magazine to promote California crops to about 
20,000 food executives around the country may also appeal to food fanatics who 
just can't learn enough about the state's real fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
With the consumer angle in mind, Jones said each issue -- bearing artful photos 
of the big crop of the month on the cover -- will include regular features by 
leading chefs on how they use California products and by the heads of wineries 
about various aspects of wine-making. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said it's premature to estimate how big California Food could grow as a 
consumer magazine. But two magazine publishers already have expressed interest 
in acquiring the magazine for its potential beyond the narrow world of food 
wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many trade magazines aimed at a specialized audience, California Food 
promises to be an attractive package. Prototypes shown by Jones contain a 
generous use of color and attractive, uncluttered layouts -- including what may 
be a first, a center spread on avocados. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presidential Perfection 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon had a deep and abiding concern about furniture and interior 
decoration. In fact, the former President and Californian, who resigned in 
disgrace in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, spent a good deal of time 
writing memos to his staff and his wife about fixing furniture, acquiring 
furniture and preserving historic scuff marks on the Oval Office floor, 
according to an article in the January issue of Washingtonian magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpted from the book, "From: The President, Richard Nixon's Secret Files," 
(edited by Bruce Oudes) the selected presidential broodings show a taste for 
minute detail as well as global issues. 
</P>
<P>
In a January, 1969, memo to his wife Pat, Nixon fretted that he needed an end 
table beside his bed "which will accommodate two Dictaphones as well a 
telephone." The impersonal memo, in which Nixon refers to himself in the third 
person, also reported that he needed a bigger table in his room for night paper 
work. "The table which is presently in the room does not allow enough room for 
him to get his knees under it," Nixon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When the Oval Office floor was refurbished, Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman 
cautioned another staffer that "The President wants to be sure that the cork 
segments in the doorway leading to the terrace, which bear the marks of 
President Eisenhower's golf shoes, are carefully preserved and removed. . . ."

JACK SMITH: ANOTHER QUOTE ATTRIBUTED TO A QUOTED OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing the other day about kittens, I quoted an eternal truth as expressed 
in verse by Ogden Nash: 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with a kitten is 
</P>
<P>
THAT 
</P>
<P>
Eventually it becomes a 
</P>
<P>
CAT 
</P>
<P>
That attribution has provoked a literary footnote from attorney John Hamilton 
Scott: "It is said that Jeremiah Clarke died of despair because his best 
Trumpet Voluntary was constantly attributed to Henry Purcell. I sometimes think 
that Richard Armour is suffering the same fate by having his works constantly 
credited to Ogden Nash. Richard Armour is one of the best American writers of 
light verse, and I believe that he does not deserve to be obscured by the more 
well-known name of Nash. 
</P>
<P>
"I must, therefore note that it was not Ogden Nash who wrote about kittens 
becoming cats; it was Richard Armour. His verse, entitled 'Lady, your claws are 
showing,' appeared in his first collection, entitled 'Light Armour,' and reads 
as follows: 
</P>
<P>
One dreadful truth I rather wish 
</P>
<P>
I did not know is that 
</P>
<P>
The woman who is kittenish 
</P>
<P>
May one day be a cat. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say first that I am a friend and a great admirer of Richard Armour, and 
I agree that in the writing of light verse he has few peers. Armour achieves 
his felicitous rhymes without distorting words, as Nash often does, e.g., (from 
"Reflections on Babies") -- 
</P>
<P>
A bit of talcum 
</P>
<P>
Is always walcom 
</P>
<P>
However, in Nash's defense, I must say that I do not consider his verse on 
kittens plagiarism. Nash was writing about kittens. Armour about women. Though 
his point was that they are in some sense similar, it remains that they are two 
different species. Besides, an idea can not be copyrighted. Armour's 
observation that kittenish women sometimes become cats, is no bar to Nash's 
observation that kittens always become cats. 
</P>
<P>
If Armour's verses are sometimes attributed to Nash, it is also true that 
Nash's verses are sometimes attributed to others. Most people think it was 
Dorothy Parker who made this classic observation -- 
</P>
<P>
Candy 
</P>
<P>
Is dandy 
</P>
<P>
But liquor 
</P>
<P>
Is quicker 
</P>
<P>
That was written by Ogden Nash. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, on the other hand, is sometimes given credit for -- 
</P>
<P>
Men seldom make passes 
</P>
<P>
At girls who wear glasses 
</P>
<P>
That was written by Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also notes that another famous Armour verse, "Going to Extremes," appears 
in "Light Armour" -- 
</P>
<P>
Shake and shake 
</P>
<P>
The catsup bottle. 
</P>
<P>
None will come, 
</P>
<P>
And then a lot'll. 
</P>
<P>
Another eternal truth encapsulated in four brief lines. ("A lot'll" is a 
precise rendition of how we say "A lot will.") 
</P>
<P>
Armour is living in retirement with his wife, Kathleen, in Claremont, and 
illness, alas, has strictured the flow from his own creative bottle. But in his 
creative lifetime Armour probably made more insightful comments on life in 
America, in fewer words, than any other writer. 
</P>
<P>
He made fun of such sacred institutions as art, education, medicine, history 
and sports, among almost everything else. In "Good Looking," from "All in 
Sport," he employed a mischievous comma to make his point -- 
</P>
<P>
It's not her figure skating that 
</P>
<P>
Men find exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
No, what they're always looking at 
</P>
<P>
Is just her figure, skating 
</P>
<P>
In the foreword Armour defined sport as -- 
</P>
<P>
Exercise 
</P>
<P>
In disguise 
</P>
<P>
He added: "That is about all I can say also for the verses in this little book: 
they are short and they rhyme. They scan, too, if your read them right. There 
is no use analyzing them for symbolism or hidden meaning or for the influence 
of Milton, John Donne, or T. S. Eliot." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Armour -- a man for our times; 
</P>
<P>
He sees, he scans, and he rhymes.

ART BUCHWALD: SON HAS DISARMING RESEARCH METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I receive a lot of interesting calls at my office. My favorite so far this year 
was from a mother who lives in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if you'd mind answering some questions on the U.S.-Soviet missile 
treaty?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be happy to," I told her. "Why do you ask?" 
</P>
<P>
"My son is home from college and he has to write a term paper on disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
"I see. Why doesn't your son call me himself?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's very busy. He needs to get his car tuned, and the only time he can see 
his girlfriend is when he comes home." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think there is something wrong with a son asking his mother to do 
his term paper for him?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind," she replied. "There is so little he needs from me these days. 
Was it Reagan's idea or Gorbachev's to reduce the missiles in Europe?" 
</P>
<P>
"Look, ma'am, I don't mind answering your questions, but if you do the work, 
your son isn't going to get anything out of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, he will. If the paper is any good, they'll give him an A." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what I mean. Mothers shouldn't be writing term papers for their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not? We pay their tuition." 
</P>
<P>
"The term paper itself isn't important -- gathering the research for it is what 
helps make the scholar." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm sure my son would research the material if he could spare the time. 
He was never lazy when he lived at home." 
</P>
<P>
"Whose idea was it for you to do this paper?" 
</P>
<P>
"Both of us. He kept complaining that his entire vacation was being ruined 
because he had to look up facts about ICBMs. Since I didn't have any other 
commitments, I volunteered to help him. After all, he is flesh and blood." 
</P>
<P>
"But if you just give him all the information, he won't understand any more 
about disarmament than he does now." 
</P>
<P>
"If he gets stuck, he can always call me. I always like to hear his voice." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know what to tell her. "Somehow I feel party to a crime," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Lipkin always helped her son Milton with his papers, and now he works for 
the State Department. Will you please tell me everything that took place in 
Geneva before they reached an agreement?" 
</P>
<P>
"That'll take a long time." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going anywhere. My son is using my car." 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there is no child abuse in your family." 
</P>
<P>
"None whatsoever. We're very close." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you are. But I would still prefer to discuss disarmament with your 
son." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter? Are you afraid that a woman can't understand it?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that. What concerns me is if something I tell you about the missile 
treaty is wrong, your son would never forgive you." 
</P>
<P>
"He has in the past," she told me. "Once I did a paper for him on Tolstoy. Are 
you going to help me or not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you so impatient?" 
</P>
<P>
"He has to get the paper in by Monday, and my husband needs at least a day to 
type it for him on his computer."

YOUR WHEELS: GETTING STEERED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I think I have a wheel-alignment problem on my 1986 Dodge van, 
because sometimes I have to turn the steering wheel about 20 degrees to keep 
the van going straight. A dealer said the steering box was defective and would 
have to be replaced at a cost of $350. He claimed steering boxes are a problem 
on large vans and usually need to be replaced every 40,000 miles. Your 
comments, please. -- A.N. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The steering box or steering gear is not usually the cause of an 
off-center steering position. What's more, unless the steering wheel is 
pulling, an off-center wheel position may only require an inexpensive alignment 
to correct. 
</P>
<P>
A mechanic usually can center a steering wheel by adjusting the tie-rod ends 
during an alignment. The steering wheel can go off center as the steering 
system wears or when the front end goes out of alignment. 
</P>
<P>
The steering gear, which converts the rotating motion of the steering column 
into the lateral motion needed to turn the front wheels, can wear out. When it 
does, a car or van usually will wander or weave in driving. The steering will 
feel loose. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chrysler steering system, there are two adjustments possible to correct 
looseness that occurs as the gears wear out. At some point, the steering gear 
cannot be adjusted any further, but that seldom occurs by 40,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1981 Oldsmobile 88 with a diesel engine. About every 10,000 miles, 
I have to return to the dealer to have a D ring replaced in the 
diesel-injection pump. It's only covered under warranty until 50,000 miles. 
Isn't there some way General Motors Corp. can make a part that won't wear out? 
-- W.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: The part you refer to has troubled many diesel owners and has been 
redesigned a number of times, GM officials say. The part keeps the governor 
assembly on the injection pump in place. Without it, the pump doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been that engine heat causes the part, made from a synthetic 
material, to deteriorate. GM believes that it has solved the problem with the 
D-ring design on its 1985 models. Dealers expect to soon receive the new 
version of the part, so check back with your dealer again in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I just bought a 1987 Honda Accord LX. When do I need to change the oil, and 
how often do I need to change it? -- R.M.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: The owner's manual recommends changing the oil every 7,500 miles. You should 
not make the first oil change any sooner, because the manufacturer uses a 
special oil in the engine to help break it in. 
</P>
<P>
But most auto experts suggest that after the break-in period you should change 
your oil more frequently. A change every 3,500 to 4,000 miles will probably 
keep your engine running cleaner and longer.

NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS; 
</P>
<P>
AN EASIER WAY TO POLISH METAL PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new product on the market that cleans tarnished silver, silverplate, 
gold, copper, bronze, most brass and most jewelry in about five seconds, 
without messy creams, rags and rubber gloves. Called Qwicksilver and just 
introduced by Silver Cleaners USA in Culver City, it works by an electrolytic 
process -- in your sink. 
</P>
<P>
Qwicksilver comes in a kit with a reusable 6x8-inch metal alloy plate and 16 
packets of an "activator powder." To clean precious metals and jewelry -- 
except for pearls and enameled items -- you place the plate in the bottom of 
the kitchen sink, fill with hot water and mix in a packet of the powder. Then 
place your jewelry and metal items in the water for a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman explained that a low-density magnetic field is created by 
the plate and powder, which safely draws the soft sulfur ions of tarnish off 
the metal pieces. She said that the powder is nontoxic. It won't do any damage 
to your sink, or hurt your hands, so you don't need rubber gloves. It's also 
odorless. 
</P>
<P>
"The tarnish comes off in about five seconds, unless something is really 
heavily tarnished, then you'll probably have to immerse it several times," she 
said. "Then you just rinse it and wipe it off with a clean towel." 
</P>
<P>
The starter kit of Qwicksilver, with plate and 16 packets, costs $30, with 
powder refills available at $12 for 20 packets. Reorder forms come with each 
kit. In Southern California, you can buy Qwicksilver at the Broadway, Bullocks, 
J. C. Penney and Robinsons.

<P>
Take Note is a handy new paperless message board that is magnetized to stick to 
your refrigerator or can be converted to an adhesive-backed board to put on the 
wall next to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
The 8 1/2x11-inch board comes with a marker pen so you can write the message 
directly on the face of the board, then erase the ink by wiping it with a dry 
tissue. Manufactured by Westar of Los Angeles, Take Note comes in seven colors 
-- white, pink, turquoise, pastel or royal blue, yellow and red -- and sells 
for $9.99. It's available at the Time Machine in Montrose, or Omni Office 
Supplies outlets.

Protecting Car Radios 
</P>
<P>
Lasso Lock is the latest in products to deter car burglars. This one, from 
Redondo Beach inventor Jay Derman, helps prevent the theft of your car stereo 
cassette deck/radio. 
</P>
<P>
Lasso Lock features a plastic-coated braided steel aircraft cable with a loop 
at one end and a locking device that fits into your cassette deck opening. 
</P>
<P>
After wrapping the cable around the spoke of the steering wheel or the steering 
column, you pass the lock through the loop to form a "lasso" around the wheel, 
then insert the lock into the cassette deck opening -- making sure it fits 
snugly against the outside radio face plate. You then insert the key and turn 
it counterclockwise, which adjusts the locking mechanism so it fits the 
cassette deck's internal configuration and locks. 
</P>
<P>
Derman said that his Lasso Lock is designed to fit car cassette decks that have 
narrow insertions for tapes, not the wide ones. "It also offers an alternative 
to removing a cassette radio and having to hide it under a seat or tote it 
around in a radio bag," he explained. "You can't cut the cable with pliers or 
files or saws. You need heavy duty bolt cutters, and that would deter car radio 
thieves. (And) if they want to steal the car, with Lasso Lock they'll have to 
break the radio to turn the steering wheel." 
</P>
<P>
Lasso Lock, which comes with two keys, costs $29.95, including shipping and 
handling and California sales tax, and is available from Z-Lock Manufacturing 
Co., 1201 N. Catalina Ave., P.O. Box 949, Redondo Beach, Calif. 90277 or by 
calling (213) 372-4842. LYNN SIMROSS

FATHER-SON TALE WITHOUT THE PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Watching the Body Burn by Thomas Glynn (Alfred A. Knopf; $18.95; 301 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Like the fisherman, the writer snags his catch out of a flowing element, now 
clear and now murky, but resembling the shining quarry not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Of the writer, though, we require something more than catching the fish. We 
need to know what is to be done with it. Is it to cook, to release, to mount 
and display, or to sneak inside someone's pillow? The writer should sense, in 
some fashion, why he is pulling the fish out, and let us sense it as well. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Glynn's novel of a son recalling his father seems to be starved of this 
sense. There is some elegant and, at times, beautiful writing. But we lack a 
father and a son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pain and Resentment 
</P>
<P>
The father, apart from a biography of eccentric dilapidation, doesn't exist as 
a character who lives or has lived. He exists as the son's pain, resentment and 
thwarted love. He approaches and recedes with the son's searching and 
distancing. And apart from a splendid section about boyhood friends and 
expeditions, the son barely exists, except as a consciousness exercising a 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than the first-person fictional memoir, the literary search for a 
mother or a father risks a kind of ultimate narcissism. The child's identity 
disappears into the parent's. And the parent, evoked to feed the child's need 
for acknowledgement, reconciliation or revenge, has no identity to begin with. 
Nobody is at home. 
</P>
<P>
The father in this book is a doctor who is a lapsed Catholic and an alcoholic, 
and incapable of holding down a position. He is a would-be writer and tinkerer, 
a man of sporadic grandiose visions and pronouncements, and utter 
unreliability. The narrator's early memories of him are vivid but without 
foundation or continuity. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy is older, the mother and father separate, and the latter wanders 
erratically from job to job around the country, turning up occasionally and 
finally, in helpless old age, spending his last days at a sister's house. He 
dies in a fire set by a dropped cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Glynn's narrative is written in the straightforward fashion of a 
memoir. At times, the memories come, as childhood memories can do, in a kind of 
dream-like fragmentation. At other times, the writing goes into a surreal, 
expressionist overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
There is, at the beginning and the end, the image of the old man in a sheet of 
flame and later, wasting away in the hospital. There is an image of the father 
and another man on a golf course, methodically slicing strips of flesh off each 
other with their clubs. There is an image of the boy's uncles dumping tons of 
baking soda on a lawn, and then joining in a slow dance. 
</P>
<P>
There is a recurring use of air images. The father speculates that people are 
simply machines that run on air, and that disease "is stagnant air where fresh 
should be." He is gripped by a fear that he is evaporating into the air, a 
representation, perhaps, of his instability. Contaminated by the image, the boy 
collects bottles -- possibly, small air reserves. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of thing tends to stand unattached. It is a dream passage that may 
suggest less to the reader than to the writer. 
</P>
<P>
In the sections recalling the narrator's fights, games, arguments and rambles 
with his boyhood friends, the touches of hallucination can be more effective. 
Glynn is at his best, in fact, in suggesting the removed world of boyhood, and 
the unease and alarm that can suddenly invade a child's pursuits and 
speculations. 
</P>
<P>
There is a splendid battle between the narrator's gang and a stronger gang on a 
nearby block. The other block smells strange, like socks or lasagna. The power 
of a smell to disquiet or reassure is peculiar to childhood, and Glynn suggests 
it powerfully. 
</P>
<P>
The fight oscillates between the prosaic and the mythical. At one point, one 
member of the rival gangs jumps from a rooftop onto a pile of mattresses he has 
thrown down beforehand. "I felt that I was in the presence of an authentic 
hero," the narrator says. "He had a sense of sadness and resignation as if he 
had no control over his heroism." The evocative tone is reminiscent of 
Alain-Fournier's adolescent classic, "The Wanderer." 
</P>
<P>
In another passage, one of the boys, after witnessing a minor car accident, is 
triggered into a wild paroxysm of death-seeking. He runs from the police 
station to a funeral home to a hospital in a vain attempt to be allowed to see 
a corpse; finally, he nails himself to a fence. The extra-real vision works 
remarkably well in suggesting how a child's erratically growing consciousness 
can be swamped suddenly by a tidal wave of futurity. 
</P>
<P>
Realistic and surreal by turns, the book founders on the inert character of the 
father-son quest. The style and stylishness adorn a bare grievance. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the book, for example, the narrator, now grown, recalls his father 
returning unexpectedly when he is not at home, and leaving a note on his 
apartment door. "Quietly descending the staircase, the boy's father hoped that 
the note would make the boy feel guilty," he tells us. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a real person tiptoeing down the stairs. It is the narrator's 
resentment, self-pity and self-abdication. Even his name is self-abdicating. He 
gives himself no name; at 50, he is only "the boy." 
</P>
<P>
There is no real father without a real son.

CITY FAILS TO ACT ON ASBESTOS PERIL AT SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Workers at the Point Loma Sewage Treatment Plant have been continually exposed 
to asbestos particles for more than a year, despite knowledge by city officials 
of an asbestos hazard at the plant, according to memos obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is a known cancer-causing agent. 
</P>
<P>
Workers said Wednesday that they worked without protective clothing in clouds 
of asbestos dust for up to six weeks in 1987 when a private contractor hired by 
the city to remodel the aging facility -- the city's only sewage processing 
plant -- unknowingly exposed asbestos in the ceiling. City officials eventually 
halted the project. 
</P>
<P>
And, more than six months after the city's asbestos expert warned other 
officials of a continuing asbestos hazard at the plant, the city has yet to 
initiate any action. In a memo dated Dec. 30, 1988, and sent to Larry King, 
Buildings Division deputy director, Alan J. Johanns noted that the city's risk 
management office had agreed on an "action to be taken" on July 8 for removal 
of all asbestos materials. 
</P>
<P>
"A change order was written and an asbestos consultant was interviewed to write 
specifications for the proper and safe removal, but for some reason no action 
has been taken. I recommend that this material be removed by this change order 
or a separate contract be written as soon as possible before the barrier falls 
and recontaminates the room and exposes the personnel," said Johanns' memo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sealing the Cracks 
</P>
<P>
The "barrier" mentioned by Johanns is plastic sheeting hanging under the 
ceiling in the plant's central control station. City safety officials ordered 
the plastic sheet draped above the workers' heads, secured by duct tape against 
the walls. Tape was also used to seal cracks in the control panels and around 
the myriad dials and gauges to prevent asbestos particles from escaping. The 
plastic is covered with dust, which contains asbestos particles that have 
fallen from the ceiling. The old ceiling in the room remained intact when city 
officials halted the remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
Workers continually enter and leave the control room to monitor the giant 
sewage and sludge pumps that serve the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several workers interviewed said they unwittingly worked in "asbestos dust 
storms" for up to six weeks in 1987 -- without respirators or protective 
clothing -- before the city and the contractor realized that the old ceiling 
was coated with asbestos. The workers also told The Times that supervisors 
ordered them to sweep up dust particles containing asbestos and throw the dusty 
powder in office trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, fearing retribution from management, agreed to talk to a reporter 
on a condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't told that it was asbestos," one worker said. "We didn't know it was 
asbestos. . . . About 20 of us here have been exposed to asbestos and taken it 
home in our clothing and shoes. I personally feel that it's criminal negligence 
on the city's part." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects Not Known 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say that asbestosis, a form of cancer caused by asbestos 
fibers, occurs after prolonged exposure. It sometimes takes years before the 
cancerous condition develops. In this case, it is not known what effect the 
brief exposure will have on workers. However, some workers fear that they were 
exposed long before 1987. 
</P>
<P>
They said that, before the plastic sheet was installed, the control room was 
often shaken by the giant pumps that move the sludge and sewage, dropping dust 
particles and fibers into the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
According to the workers, about 90% of the asbestos-coated ceiling was removed 
before city officials discovered that it was coated with the deadly fibers. 
Plant workers said the construction began in November or December, 1987, and 
lasted four to six weeks before it was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to confirm this date with city agencies were unsuccessful, as one 
official after another directed a reporter to a different agency and city 
official. Roger Graff, an engineer with the Water Utilities Department, said 
the dates sound right but he is not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Rudolph Hradecky, who was brought into the fray after the 
fact to study any liabilities that the city may be held accountable for, said 
he is not sure if the workers' exposure lasted six weeks. "I couldn't give you 
a factual period of time, but it wasn't for just one day," Hradecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Will Pslugh, vice president of Engicon Corp. in Sorrento Valley, the 
construction company hired to remodel the plant, declined comment and referred 
all questions to city officials. However, a female employee at the company who 
would not give her name confirmed that the project was halted when asbestos was 
found in the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Graff said Engicon is not licensed to handle asbestos and is still negotiating 
with the city over a change order. In order for Engicon to continue with the 
project, the company will have to subcontract the asbestos removal to a 
qualified firm, Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Up With Inaction 
</P>
<P>
Workers and representatives from the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, Local 127, which represents some employees at the plant, 
said they agreed to meet with a reporter because they were fed up with the 
city's inaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to work under these conditions for over a year now. The city told us 
that they would monitor our health by giving us physicals every year. . . . 
Maybe we've already been killed or maybe we haven't," one worker said. "It 
takes 20, 30 or 40 years before asbestos turns to cancer. I guess the city 
figures that by then we'll all be dead or too old to sue them." 
</P>
<P>
According to several workers who described the conditions in the plant, there 
was "a lot of dust, clouds of it" hanging inside the building while Engicon 
employees removed the old ceiling. Workers said asbestos dust covered 
everything in the office areas and occasionally got in their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"When it piled up too heavy on the floor, several of us were told to get brooms 
and dustpans and sweep it up. Dust was constantly flying around everywhere, and 
we walked around in our regular work clothes," said another worker. 
</P>
<P>
After city officials discovered the asbestos, plant workers were issued 
protective clothing and respirators, employees said. The remodeling was halted 
a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by a reporter to get a response from city officials to the employees' 
accusations were unsuccessful Wednesday, when no fewer than 10 officials from 
different agencies either failed to return calls or referred questions to other 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stephens, spokesman for the California Department of Industrial 
Relations, said his office had not received any complaints about the Point Loma 
facility. But Stephens said that, if it receives at least one complaint about 
asbestos contamination from an employee or union official, the department will 
send an investigator to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an imminent hazard, the area could be put off limits, closed off 
until the hazard is taken care of," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
If state officials closed the Point Loma plant, they would shut down the city's 
only waste-treatment facility.

UNION BOSS PUT ON LEAVE DURING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wyleen Luoma, general manager of the 6,500-member County Employees Assn., and 
her top aide were placed on a 10-day paid leave Wednesday. The group's 
executive committee is investigating charges of misconduct and abuse of 
authority leveled against Luoma. 
</P>
<P>
The committee acted after a stormy, six-hour meeting that began at 6 p.m. 
Tuesday. CEA officials declined to discuss the action publicly and said a 
decision on Luoma's and Kathleen Thompson's future will be made by Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Internal Fighting Waged 
</P>
<P>
The CEA, one of the largest independent labor groups in the state, has been 
torn apart by an internal rift the past two years. Last month, the union lost a 
major battle when almost 500 members from the health-services unit voted to 
have their interests represented by the Service Employees International Union, 
Local 102. 
</P>
<P>
Health workers complained that Luoma and field representative Katy Scales 
failed to return phone calls and generally ignored grievances against 
management. The controversy continued when the workers discovered that Scales 
had no labor experience and is a family friend of Luoma. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Martin, president of the CEA and an ally of Luoma, was also "temporarily" 
impeached during the raucous meeting by the group's board of directors, said 
one participant who requested anonymity. Martin can be removed permanently at 
the next meeting if the board upholds her impeachment by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleas Were Unheeded 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was placed on leave because she is a loyal ally of Luoma and the 
subject of several charges of misconduct and lying, the participant said. Luoma 
and Thompson pleaded their cases Tuesday night but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
The CEA's internal problems and the SEIU Local 102's success at raiding some of 
the association's members have encouraged other local unions to look at the 
possibility of recruiting some of the group's members.

STRONGER ODOR OF NATURAL GAS TRIGGERS COMPLAINT CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric has been bombarded the past week by calls from 
about 6,000 customers reporting natural gas leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Few major leaks, however, have been found by SDG&amp;E employees dispatched to 
check out the complaints, said Fred Vaughn, a spokesman for the utility. 
Instead, most cases have turned out to be customers with normally undetectable 
leaks reacting to a stronger odor in gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is odorless, tasteless and colorless in its natural state. "We use 
an odorant so that if gas leaks you will detect it by smelling it," Vaughn 
said. "With regular concentration of the odorant, only with a very serious leak 
will you smell it. With a larger concentration of odorant, with any minute leak 
that wouldn't normally be a problem, you'll smell it." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the stronger odor is unknown, but Vaughn speculated that it 
might have been caused by a shift to a different supply of gas. The supply 
source in Texas was changed when a processing plant went out of service, 
prompting a change to a different gas field and pipeline. The increased 
concentration could have resulted during the changeover, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn said the concentration of odorant should return to normal within a few 
days. Until then, SDG&amp;E employees are working overtime to check out 
gas-leak complaints. "We've got a safety problem, and we're telling customers, 
'We'll get to you, but it may take a little bit longer.' " 
</P>
<P>
Small leaks usually pose no danger, Vaughn said, but the utility is responding 
to all complaints. "You never can tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with the public. We can't take a chance. We have to go out and 
check it." 
</P>
<P>
Calls to SDG&amp;E increase during the winter, but the calls are usually 
related to appliance adjustments, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually don't get quite so many," he said. "We've had so many calls this 
week, it's close to some sort of record."

THIRD WORLD DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Living standards in sub-Saharan Africa have been declining steadily for more 
than a decade," says Barber Conable (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 3). In other words, the 
mother who bought a loaf of bread in 1980 now gets by on a half. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the rest of his column the president of the World Bank loses touch with 
that mother. He prefers sophisticated financial arguments over Third World 
debt. The economic-adjustment programs applied by the bank have resulted in big 
reductions in health care and social services in debtor countries. So the 
mother must walk farther to the clinic when her children are sick. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it is the poor who suffer most from the debt crisis. As part of 
U.S. support for the World Bank, we must force it to look at the human face of 
poverty. The problems of the African mothers are easily hidden behind the 
billions of dollars of debt.

NO ACCORD IN DISPUTE OVER FUTURE OF MIRALESTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula school board and a parents group exchanged 
compromise proposals this week aimed at resolving disputes over the future of 
Miraleste High School and the group's effort to split the district into two 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous reconciliation efforts, however, both compromises were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The parents group, the East Peninsula Education Council, said it still wants to 
set up a separate system, but offered to be "very flexible" in negotiating a 
division of district property if the board agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, whose decision last year to close Miraleste sparked the secession 
movement, countered with a proposal to convert Miraleste to a 
sixth-through-eighth-grade intermediate school and ordered a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No High School 
</P>
<P>
The district's proposal would still leave no high school on the east side of 
the peninsula, but students could attend east-side schools until eighth grade. 
Under the old plan, only first through sixth grades would be taught at 
east-side schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," said Donna Perrin, the parent group president, after a 
discussion of the proposals at a board meeting Monday night. The trustees 
"missed the heart of a very exciting idea, which was to structure a win-win 
solution in which both sides could get what they need." 
</P>
<P>
Countered district spokeswoman Nancy Mahr: "We don't see two districts as any 
sort of compromise." 
</P>
<P>
The parents council, which formed after the school board's decision in late 
1987 to close Miraleste, takes an either-or position: Continue 
kindergarten-through-12th grade education on the east side of the peninsula, or 
form a separate school district. 
</P>
<P>
The school board maintains that with its declining enrollment, the district 
cannot afford to keep Miraleste open as a high school, and that splitting the 
9,100-student district would lower the quality of education for all students, 
Mahr said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's efforts to close Miraleste have been blocked until at least next 
school year, pending the outcome of legal maneuvers by the two sides. 
Meanwhile, the state Board of Education is reviewing the east-side group's 
petition to create its own district and is expected to issue its ruling in 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
If the state agency concludes that legal criteria for setting up a new district 
have been met, it will call an election to settle the issue. It will also 
decide whether the vote will be districtwide or limited to voters in the 
proposed new district, which is generally bounded on the west by Crenshaw 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 25% of Voters 
</P>
<P>
Perrin, the council president, conceded that the sparsely populated east side, 
which has only about 25% of the peninsula's voters, is unlikely to prevail if 
the vote is districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
However, she contended that east-siders have a right to decide by themselves 
whether to set up a separate district in their area. In the unsuccessful effort 
this week to gain the school board's support for that position, the council, in 
a letter to the board, offered "to consider any reasonable proposal" for a 
"fair and equitable" division of the district's reserve funds and property. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a negotiated settlement, Perrin said, the division of assets 
would be governed by state law, to the potential disadvantage of the district. 
She said the settlement would have to be approved as special legislation to 
ensure that it is "legally binding and enforceable." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro) has offered to carry the legislation, 
Perrin and Tom Jankovich, the council's chairman, said in their letter to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
East-Siders Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
Perrin, in a telephone interview, said east-siders are skeptical about the 
trustees' proposal to convert Miraleste to an intermediate school. For one 
thing, she said, the change would not be binding on future school boards and, 
for another, the parents council is committed to keeping Miraleste open as a 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
That goal can be achieved in the existing district, the parent leaders 
contended in presenting a second alternative to the board. They said the 
district's financial picture has improved, making it feasible to continue 
operating Miraleste along with two larger high schools on the west side, 
Rolling Hills and Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Mahr said nothing has changed, in terms of finances and educational programs, 
that would justify operating three high schools.

ALREADY $1 MILLION AHEAD, CAMARILLO MAN TO SPIN LOTTERY WHEEL 3RD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only man in state lottery history to win three appearances on the "Big 
Spin" said Wednesday he owes his good fortune to Abe Lincoln and Japan's 
tallest mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Warrick Woodard, 48, of Camarillo will make an unprecedented third appearance 
on the lottery's television show Saturday night -- armed with some pebbles from 
Mt. Fuji and a penny he found in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard, a Navy boatswain's mate at Port Hueneme, said that kissing the penny 
and the rocks before spinning the lottery's wheel during two appearances on the 
TV show last year helped him win $1,010,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a poor country boy making $25,000 a year before I found this penny and 
took out this holy rock from my collection of travel mementos," Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard is the first person in the California State Lottery's three-year 
history to win three chances to spin the wheel, lottery spokesman John Schade 
said. Lottery officials hold a weekly drawing of scratch-off ticket winners to 
select contestants for the half-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of being picked three times are "really astronomical," Schade said. 
"This guy has the luckiest streak of anyone I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Three other people have been on the Big Spin twice, Schade said. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard is guaranteed another $10,000 simply by appearing on the show. But if 
his lucky charms really come through for him, he could win another $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found Lucky Penny 
</P>
<P>
Before Woodard struck it rich on the Big Spin, he said, things weren't going 
that well in his life. He and his wife, Darlene, were living on opposite coasts 
while they waited for affordable housing to become available at the Port 
Hueneme base. 
</P>
<P>
Then Woodard, who was living in a barracks on the base, found his lucky penny 
in the parking lot of a nearby convenience store and began buying about 12 
lottery tickets a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won $10,000 on the show in April. Five weeks later, he won $1 million, which 
lottery officials said he will receive in $50,000 annual installments over the 
next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
After his big win, his wife, 40, promptly moved to Camarillo from Stafford, Va. 
The couple bought a $250,000 house and a new car. 
</P>
<P>
But the Woodards say their phenomenal luck hasn't changed them much. 
</P>
<P>
Warrick Woodard said he doesn't plan to retire from the Navy until 1993 when 
his hitch is up. And Darlene Woodard complained that the price of Wonder bread 
is more than twice as much in Camarillo as in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got so sick to my stomach from nerves the day we won a million 
dollars," she said. "Maybe the penny and those stones are all psychological, 
but, heck, if it works, go for it."

RAGTIME WINS: COURT RULES HORSE CAN STAY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ragtime, the 28-inch-high miniature horse, has cleared what appears to be the 
last hurdle in a two-year-long fight by its owner to keep the animal as a pet 
at her Thousand Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Municipal Judge John J. Hunter on Wednesday found Ragtime owner Patty 
Fairchild not guilty of charges that she violated a city zoning law prohibiting 
horses and other livestock in her Oakbrook Village neighborhood. Following a 
two-day trial, the judge ruled that because of its size, Fairchild's American 
miniature horse should be considered a domestic pet, such as a cat or dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless," Fairchild said in a telephone interview. "I was crying and 
hugging my attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling is the latest in a series of court battles fought by 
Fairchild, who was first told by city officials to remove Ragtime in December, 
1986. After appointing a citizens committee to study whether Ragtime was a 
horse or a pet, the City Council voted in May, 1987, to press efforts to have 
Ragtime evicted. Since then, attorneys for the city have lost two other court 
cases against Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
A judge had ruled in September, 1987, that the city zoning code regarding 
horses was poorly worded and unenforceable. The law at the time prohibited the 
keeping of two horses on properties that are smaller than 20,000 square feet, 
such as Fairchild's. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city appealed the decision. But an appellate court upheld the 
ruling in July. Two days after the appellate court ruled that the city law 
could not be used to prosecute Fairchild because it did not mention 
restrictions against a single horse, the city issued a new citation under a law 
revised to close that loophole. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild, who faced fines of up to $160 a day for keeping Ragtime at her home, 
said the animal made a good impression before the judge during a court 
appearance Tuesday. "He was compared with a Great Dane that weighed the same as 
Ragtime but came in panting and knocking things over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild said she hopes that this is the last time she hears from the city 
about Ragtime. Officials from the Thousand Oaks city attorney's office did not 
return telephone calls for comment. "I just hope that they don't waste any more 
taxpayers' money," Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said he could not calculate how much 
the city has spent trying to evict Ragtime.

TORRANCE SEEKS STATE FUNDING FOR BIKE PATH AROUND MADRONA MARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to improve the appearance of Madrona Marsh, Torrance officials are 
seeking state money to help pay for a tree-lined bicycle and jogging path 
around the 42-acre nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council unanimously approved an application for a $427,000 
grant from the State Department of Parks and Recreation. The total cost of the 
path has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed path, varying in width from 8 to 20 feet, is expected to be 
completed by next January if the city can raise the money, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Madrona Marsh, which is bounded by Sepulveda Boulevard, Madrona Avenue, Maple 
Avenue and Plaza Del Amo, is a seasonal wetland used by about 140 species of 
migratory birds, frogs, snakes and other small animals. It is one of the few 
natural wetlands remaining in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The path, lined with trees, bushes and an irrigation system, would replace the 
overgrown weeds and litter along the marsh's perimeter. "Right now it looks 
like a big hole in the ground," said Parks and Recreation Director Gene 
Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said a new fence would replace the deteriorating chain-link fence 
surrounding the marsh. He said a new fence is needed to keep trespassers from 
disturbing wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert agreed. "It will provide a buffer from the noise and 
traffic" of the streets, she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The frontage along Sepulveda Boulevard already has a paved bike path, but it is 
not landscaped or fitted for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that the city is applying for this (grant)," said Ken Gaugh, 
president of Friends of Madrona Marsh, an environmental group that has worked 
for more than a decade to preserve the marsh. "It will be better aesthetically 
for the people." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tickled pink," said Shirley Turner, a longtime member of the group. "I 
couldn't be happier." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it stinks," said Sam Suitt, a former president and current member of 
the preservation group. "It's a needless encroachment on the marsh." 
</P>
<P>
Suitt said the proposed path will take away too much land from the sensitive 
nature preserve. "A 4-foot-wide sidewalk would be sufficient," he said. "But 
the whole point is to keep it as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett acknowledged that the path will encroach on some sensitive portions of 
the marsh, but not substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of degree," he said. "Frankly, I don't see it as a significant 
impact on the marsh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Builder Donated Land 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1983 agreement between the city and the developers of Park Del Amo, a 
massive residential and office project next to the marsh, the developer won the 
right to build 1,482 residential units and 850,000 square feet of office space 
in exchange for donating 34 1/2 acres of marshland and selling an additional 8 
acres to the city. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the developer also agreed to pay for a path along 
Plaza Del Amo, Maple and Sepulveda. Barnett said the details have not been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said he is optimistic about getting the grant but that if the request 
is rejected, the city will try for other state or federal money.

REFERENDUM FOR REPEAL OF CONSTRUCTION LIMITS IS UNDER REVIEW IN ROLLING HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A referendum petition seeking the repeal of an ordinance that allows Rolling 
Hills to reject construction in conflict with the city's General Plan is being 
reviewed by the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of the ordinance, which was unanimously approved by the City 
Council in November, has been suspended pending verification of the petition's 
validity, said City Manager Terrence Belanger. 
</P>
<P>
Under that process, the city attorney first must determine if the petition's 
wording complies with state law. If it does, the Los Angeles County registrar 
of voters will be asked to verify that the petition contains 148 valid 
signatures -- 10% of the city's 1,478 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
If the petition -- which contains 185 signatures -- are validated, the City 
Council can rescind the ordinance or put it to a vote, said Belanger. The 
council would make that decision this month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the council does not rescind the ordinance, an election must be held within 
75 to 89 days of the date the council makes that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was to have become effective Dec. 28, but opponents filed 
petitions against it on Dec. 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which applies to all new construction including remodeling, was 
approved unanimously by the council in November despite significant community 
opposition. Council members said the ordinance would support the goals of the 
General Plan, which include the preservation of a rural atmosphere, open space, 
natural vegetation and hilly topography. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the ordinance decried a trend over the past few years to build 
large homes to the limits of city codes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said they feared the measure would limit the size of homes that could 
be built on large lots and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
Should the ordinance be repealed, it cannot be considered again by the council 
for a year. If it is not repealed, the ordinance takes effect on the date the 
referendum results are certified to the council.

SMOG-RIDDEN BURBANK TO STUDY HOW TO CUT CAR USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with some of the worst air pollution in the Los Angeles area, the Burbank 
City Council has approved a study of several measures designed to cut down on 
the number of city employees driving cars to work. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank transportation officials plan to consider seeking more convenient bus 
service and encouraging city employees to ride bicycles to work or share cars. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is requiring all private and 
public employers of more than 100 people in Southern California to submit plans 
to cut down on the number of vehicles that employees drive to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans are to be used by the AQMD and the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments to implement a regional plan to reduce air pollution by the year 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Development Controls 
</P>
<P>
Burbank, which approved the study late Tuesday night, is also considering 
placing controls on development and rescheduling and reducing work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, Helene Buchman, the city's transportation planning 
manager, said that 78% of city employees at three sites come to work in their 
own vehicles on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the city of Burbank will need to create aggressive programs at 
each site to encourage more ride-sharing and use of public transit," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Buchman added that a survey of city employees concluded that they are 
not interested in ride-sharing, and it would take considerable effort on the 
city's part to encourage participation in such a program. 
</P>
<P>
The workplaces surveyed were City Hall, the Police Department and the main fire 
station, which are downtown; the Public Service Department at 164 W. Magnolia 
Blvd., and the Public Works Department at 124 S. Lake Ave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
85% Survey Response 
</P>
<P>
The survey was answered by about 85% of all city employees, Buchman said. It 
found that between 6 and 10 a.m., 1,717 employees a week arrive downtown to 
work, 1,410 employees arrive at the Public Service Department and 1,145 
employees arrive at the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Buchman proposed that an employee transportation coordinator be appointed at 
each site to form ride-sharing programs, as well as to promote public transit 
and alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The feasibility of van pools and car pools will also be explored, Buchman said. 
</P>
<P>
An AQMD report released last year named the Burbank area -- which includes 
Glendale, North Hollywood and Van Nuys -- as one of three "hot spots" for air 
pollution in Los Angeles County. Hot spots are areas that show significantly 
higher concentrations of toxic air contaminants, the agency said. The other two 
areas singled out were Rancho Dominguez and Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrations in the areas pose a cancer risk that, while low, is twice as 
high as in other areas of Los Angeles, the report said. The increased risk 
means that the amount of contaminants could cause cancer in 100 of 100,000 
people, based on the assumption that a person could be exposed to the high 
concentrations over 70 years, district officials said.

EL SEGUNDO SETS SPECIAL ELECTION ON NEW TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo City Council members, uncertain whether a recent court decision lets 
them impose new taxes without a citywide vote, have decided to hold a special 
election on two tax measures. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting in special session Tuesday night, council members let stand their 
earlier decision to schedule the March 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
The measures would increase taxes for businesses and property owners and raise 
an estimated $6 million for the financially strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
Council members held the special session to reconsider the issue mainly because 
canceling the election would have saved the city an estimated $20,000, 
according to Councilman Scot Dannen. However, if it had been canceled, the 
council majority -- made up of Dannen, Mayor Carl Jacobson and Councilman Jim 
Clutter -- could have enacted whatever revenue measures they preferred, and 
they have opposed higher taxes on residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reluctant Compromise 
</P>
<P>
The council's November decision to put the two measures on the ballot, which 
under state law requires four votes, was a compromise with which no council 
member was happy. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority reluctantly agreed to put the measure affecting property 
owners, including residents, on the ballot only after Councilmen Alan West and 
Bob Anderson insisted on it. West and Anderson have generally opposed imposing 
any new taxes on businesses unless new taxes are also imposed on residents. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council decided to proceed with the election after it was 
confronted with conflicting legal interpretations of a decision handed down by 
the Court of Appeal in Santa Ana last September. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court, in an opinion written by Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr., 
invalidated Proposition 62, the initiative sponsored by Howard Jarvis in 1986 
that required voter approval for all taxes imposed by cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Over Approval 
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling held that the city of Westminster had the authority to 
impose a utility users' tax without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley interpreted the higher court's ruling to 
mean that the El Segundo council could impose new taxes without a citywide 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney for the city clerk's office, Stephanie Sher, interpreted the 
ruling to apply only to cities that imposed taxes before the passage of the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster City Council enacted that community's utility user's tax in 
September, 1986, less than two months before California voters approved 
Proposition 62. 
</P>
<P>
Even though El Segundo will hold an election, Councilman West called it a waste 
of taxpayers' money because the council has yet to reach final agreement on an 
overall fiscal strategy for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have our act together," he said. ". . . I think it is time to step 
back and look at our needs and itemize them in great detail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Right to Decide 
</P>
<P>
But Dannen said the election should tell council members how voters want the 
city's money problems to be solved. And regardless of the confusion over the 
recent court decision, he said, the electorate should have the right to decide 
tax issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If the voters do not have the right to vote on these taxes, they should," 
Dannen said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the measures on the ballot would impose a $60-per-unit tax on 
residential property. Owners of non-residential property of less than 5,000 
square feet would pay a flat rate of $200 a year. Larger businesses would be 
taxed according to floor space. 
</P>
<P>
The other measure would boost the utility user tax, which applies only to 
businesses, to 4% and make it permanent. The current 2% utility tax is due to 
expire in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The measures will require a simple majority to pass.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of sexually molesting a 
9-year-old girl, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Darnell Randolph, 45, of the 1300 block of East Main Street, was helping 
friends move out of an apartment on Avocado Avenue when they asked him to stay 
with their daughter while she slept, El Cajon police said. 
</P>
<P>
While the parents moved some belongings, Randolph allegedly sexually molested 
the girl, awakening her, police said. When the parents returned, the girl told 
them what happened and the parents called them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph was arrested at the Avocado Avenue apartment without incident, a 
police spokesman said. He was being held Wednesday at San Diego County Jail, in 
lieu of $25,000 bail.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST: WRIGHT QUITS ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political consultant Rod Wright has dropped out of the race for the 50th 
Assembly District seat of the late Curtis R. Tucker. He endorsed Tucker's son, 
Curtis R. Tucker Jr., in the Feb. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime campaign consultant, Wright said Wednesday that the short campaign 
period and the backing of powerful Democrats make Tucker unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in being a spoiler," said Wright, who had never run for 
office before. "I don't want to run in a race when I don't feel there's a 
chance I can win." 
</P>
<P>
Wright's name will still appear on the special election ballot, along with 
fellow Democrats Tucker, Inglewood school board member Lois Hill-Hale and Los 
Angeles police officer Carl McGill. Business consultant Michael Davis is the 
only Republican. Wright said his withdrawal makes it more likely that Tucker 
will get more than 50% of the vote. If he does, Tucker will win the seat and 
avoid an April runoff against Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The district encompasses El Segundo, Inglewood, Lennox, Westchester and parts 
of South Los Angeles.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHO BERNARDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn its complaint against 
Northern Telecom Electronics, a Rancho Bernardo firm that had faced a $20,000 
fine for allegedly violating federal Clean Water Act guidelines by dumping 
3,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide into city sewers last April. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald in San Francisco said Wednesday that the spill 
was not as dangerous as the company first thought when it voluntarily reported 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The original complaint was based on information they themselves provided to 
us, and there were some errors in their data," she said. Among other things, 
the waste-water discharge didn't contain the high levels of acidity that were 
first believed, and the waste did not upset sewage treatment at the Escondido 
plant that treats Rancho Bernardo's sewage. 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the company, which manufactures computer chips for 
telecommunications purposes, has corrected the deficiencies that led to the 
spill.

<P>
The California Highway Patrol on Wednesday was still investigating a motorcycle 
accident in which a Rancho Santa Fe man was killed when his bike hit a fence 
post. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy House, 23, of the 14000 block of Via de la Valle, was going about 50 
m.p.h. as he rounded a corner, heading west on San Dieguito Road, west of Calle 
del Nido, when he crashed about 6:15 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said. He was not 
wearing a helmet.

<P>
"We know what happened, but we don't know why," said CHP spokesman Jerry 
Bohrer. 
</P>
<P>
House was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital, where he died of head injuries 
shortly after 7 p.m., hospital spokesman Mike Dabney said. 
</P>

WOODLAND HILLS BUILDING BAN ON SMALL HILLSIDE LOTS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 2-year-old prohibition on the building of large houses on small lots in a 
hillside area of Woodland Hills was extended for six months by the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was proposed in late 1986 by Councilman Marvin Braude because of 
concern about problems caused by the construction of large houses on 
substandard lots in the Giraud tract, a 1 1/2-square-mile area south of Ventura 
Boulevard and east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The area was developed by Woodland Hills founder Victor Giraud in 1922 as a 
weekend retreat for Los Angeles residents. Lots were subdivided to average 
about 3,500 square feet -- less than a third the size that now would be 
required for a building lot. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium is designed to give city planners time to review ways of 
regulating development in the area, such as restricting the size of new homes 
or requiring parking, sewers and street improvements before building. It 
prohibits building on any lots less than 5,000 square feet. Property owners can 
seek exemptions from the City Council.

MCMAHON WOULD APPROVE TRADE TO CHARGERS: AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agent for Jim McMahon says the controversial quarterback is unhappy with 
the way the Bears treated him in 1988 and that the Chargers are one of two 
teams McMahon would consider playing for if the Bears trade him. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego would be an interesting place for Jim," agent Steve Zucker said. "If 
we had to pick a spot, we'd probably pick San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's season ended Sunday in Chicago when the Bears lost, 28-3, to the San 
Francisco 49ers in the NFC championship game. McMahon, starting for the first 
time in 10 weeks because of a sprained knee, completed 14 of 29 passes for 121 
yards and had 1 pass intercepted. Bear Coach Mike Ditka removed McMahon with 
6:53 remaining and replaced him with Mike Tomczak. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended a frustrating season for the former Brigham Young quarterback who 
injured his knee in Week 9 and missed 7 games. McMahon said he was ready to 
return and was miffed when Ditka started Tomczak the last regular season game 
and the first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bears treated him (McMahon) so bad, you have no idea," Zucker said. "It's 
been a very rough year the way the Bears treated him." 
</P>
<P>
It was also a year in which the Bears saw enough improvement in Tomczak to 
consider him a starter. More and more, it begins to look as if McMahon is the 
quarterback of somebody else's future. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker said he was unaware of any trade talks under way between the Bears and 
the Chargers. There were unsubstantiated reports Tuesday in two Chicago 
newspapers suggesting a deal between the Chargers and the Bears for McMahon was 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
But no official for either team has confirmed any such talks. Steve Ortmayer, 
the Chargers' director of football operations, and Alex Spanos, the team's 
owner, did not return phone calls from The Times Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Bear president Michael McCaskey said: "You think that (a 
trade) is happening. It's not. You guys (the media) are talking about that and 
nobody else is. We just haven't had time to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears traditionally spend the first week after the season evaluating their 
personnel and trying to decide what direction they want to head during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not spent much time thinking about those things (trades) yet," 
McCaskey said. 
</P>
<P>
But it's no secret the Bears have grown increasingly weary of McMahon's 
outlandish behavior and continual public potshots at McCaskey, Ditka and 
others. At one point this season, McMahon said team trainer Fred Caito couldn't 
tell "the difference between a blister and a compound fracture." 
</P>
<P>
The injury-prone McMahon will turn 30 in August. The most games he has started 
for the Bears in his 7-year NFL career was 13 in 1983. In 1985, he returned 
from shoulder, neck, leg and buttocks injuries to lead the Bears to a 46-10 
victory over New England in Super Bowl XX. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim's mobility is still good," Zucker said. "His knees are fine and he can 
still move." 
</P>
<P>
But most regular observers of the Bears this season did not share Zucker's 
opinion of McMahon's skills. 
</P>
<P>
A news columnist with the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that the Chargers 
would have to give up a No. 1 and a No. 3 pick in the 1991 draft for McMahon. 
However, word around the league is that many teams wouldn't take McMahon off 
the Bears' hands for free: Too little discipline; too many injuries. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon has 1 more year remaining on a contract that will pay him a base salary 
of $800,000 in 1989. The other West Coast team he has talked about playing for 
in the past is the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Raiders just spent a lot of money on Jay Schroeder," Zucker said. 
"Besides, Jim feels like San Diego (Jack Murphy Stadium) is his lucky stadium. 
It's grass and it's good weather." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980 Holiday Bowl, McMahon led BYU to a thrilling 46-45 victory over 
Southern Methodist when he hit receiver Clay Brown with a 41-yard touchdown 
pass as time expired. In that game, McMahon completed 32 of 49 passes for 446 
yards and 4 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the Holiday Bowl with the Cougars the following year to complete 
27 of 43 passes for 342 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 38-36 victory over 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question the Chargers need a quarterback, a point former Cleveland 
Coach Marty Schottenheimer reportedly emphasized to them over the weekend in 
his talks with Ortmayer and Spanos about the team's vacant head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Charger starter is Mark Malone, who finished last among AFC 
quarterbacks in 1988 with a rating of 58.8. Malone played behind an offensive 
line that improved dramatically during the season, but one that was made up of 
four free agents and a fourth-round rookie.

BELL RETURNS HOME, GAINS NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>

<P>
Coming home to play his senior season at San Diego State sounded soothing to 
Shawn Bell. 
</P>
<P>
He had seen enough of the country in 3 barnstorming seasons at Chicago State. 
It was time to return to the city and neighborhood he left at age 17, only a 
few months removed from his playing days at Morse High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt real good about it -- to be back where I was born and raised," Bell 
said. "I had this idea about going back to see old friends, relive old times." 
</P>
<P>
Bell cherished those times the most. But as he soon learned, home was different 
now. It had changed; he had changed. Those simple times were lost. 
</P>
<P>
He has found some old friends down and out. He has discovered others deep into 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The drugs are what really shocked me," Bell said. "I left at age 17, that age 
when you're just coming out of high school, and you and your friends are real 
close. But I was gone for 3 years and lost touch. To come back and see a lot of 
my friends using drugs, it really hurt me. It was something that was unreal." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stories tear at Bell's heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I went by one guy's house from high school and his brother was there," Bell 
recalled. "He told me, 'Shawn, you need to talk to my brother. He is messing 
around (with drugs). He's skinny and looking bad.' It really hurt me to hear 
that. You try to talk to them, but when they are in that condition, it doesn't 
do much good." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing old friends in trouble has made his return to San Diego a time of 
reflection for Bell. It has helped him put basketball in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be a season he devoted to playing basketball, a chance to learn the 
game's finer points from SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg and play out the final 
moments of his college career in front of family and friends. But it has become 
more than that. It has been a time for Bell to better understand where he was 
raised, the people he knew then and adult life he has begun to build for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bell is the father of a 7-month-old child named Brandon. Bell lives with his 
son and Tracy Bonner, the baby's mother and his girlfriend of 3 years. They 
share an apartment across the street from his mother's house in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a child is something that really woke me up," Bell said. "Usually the 
athlete's existence in high school and college is kind of wild. But being a 
father has made me realize a lot of responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Bell said he and Bonner debated whether she should move from her home in Los 
Angeles so they could live together in San Diego. After some discussion, they 
decided to make their home here. Bell said he was influenced by his own 
experience of growing up in a single-parent home. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up without a father," Bell said, "and I always told myself that if I 
ever had a kid, I would do whatever I could to take care of that child." 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has made the decision, Bell said he could not be happier, despite 
the difficulties in raising an infant while trying to be a full-time student 
and basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"After about 2 months, I had to go to my mother and thank her," Bell said. "Now 
I know what raising a child like me must have been like, because I was a rough 
kid growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"But to see Brandon grow up, to see him get his first teeth, to come home to 
him. It's an experience that is hard to describe." 
</P>
<P>
While his domestic duties have added to Bell's responsibilities, they have not 
prevented him from trying to do his best on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding that this is an important year for me," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
The early results have him firmly holding the starting spot at small forward. 
He enters tonight's Western Athletic Conference game at Brigham Young (6:30 
PST) among the team leaders in the most important categories. He is second in 
rebounding (6.2 per game) and third in scoring (10.6 points per game), assists 
(40) and steals (14). 
</P>
<P>
His ability to step in after sitting out last season under National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. transfer rules and make an immediate impact is one reason the 
Aztecs (8-4, 2-0 in WAC) are off to their best start in 4 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"When we took Shawn, we thought we would get a very athletic basketball player 
who could run and jump and rebound," Brandenburg said. "Shawn sees himself more 
as an offensive player than a rebounder, defensive-type player; we've been 
working with him to make him more of an all-around player." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a 6-foot 6-inch senior, said the opportunity to develop his overall 
skills is one of the main reasons he decided to play for Brandenburg. Bell said 
he wanted that kind of discipline after 3 seasons at Chicago State. 
</P>
<P>
Bell came to Chicago State when the school first moved up to NCAA Division I 
play. It was a time of transition in which Chicago State, a new independent, 
traveled the country looking for games. In Bell's junior season, Chicago State 
had a schedule of 18 road games and 10 home games, including a nearly 
month-long, 9-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun at first," Bell said. "But the travel got a little tiring in the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
The pace got to the coach, too, and Bob Hallberg left for Illinois Chicago 
after that season. The school did not name a new coach until late in the summer 
and during that time Bell became disenchanted with the program and the school. 
It was then that he thought about returning home. 
</P>
<P>
Bell had come full circle from his reasoning at the time that he decided to 
attend Chicago State. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I needed to get away because the way I grew up here, the surroundings 
weren't that great. I thought it would be best for me to get away from here, 
mature and really find out what life was about." 
</P>
<P>
So Bell went back to San Diego. He found a different city then the one he 
remembered. But sometimes he wonders if it is the city that has changed or the 
way he views it. 
</P>

Brigham Young (5-6, 0-2 in WAC) is coming off losses at New Mexico and Texas El 
Paso. The Cougars are without forward Andy Toolson, who had surgery to repair a 
broken thumb Sunday. Toolson, the team's second-leading scorer at 16.9 points 
per game and leading rebounder (8.1 per game), is expected to be replaced by 
freshman John Fish (2.7 points per game). . . . After playing at Brigham Young 
tonight, San Diego State continues its first Western Athletic Conference trip 
of the season Saturday at Utah (9-8, 0-2).

D'ALESSANDRO, TRUE TO HIS WORD, RETIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three decades ago Frank D'Alessandro, Monroe High's football coach, made a pact 
with himself: Thirty years of coaching and then it's adios. 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro, 55, made good on that promise this week, announcing his 
retirement from coaching after 30 years at the high school level, including 28 
as a head coach. D'Alessandro coached at Washington, Fairfax and Monroe, 
compiling a 146-91-14 record as a head coach, including a 9-2 mark at Monroe in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro, who will retire from teaching at the end of the school year, will 
coach one more game, sharing responsibilities with Bill Redell as head coach at 
an all-star game sponsored by the Daily News of Van Nuys this summer. Redell 
also left a high school job after the season, resigning as Crespi's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said I'd go 30 years and get out, and it is nice to go out after 
having a good season," D'Alessandro said. "I know I'm going to miss it after 
being out there after 30 years. I'll miss the kids and other coaches, but I'll 
probably miss game day the most. It's so invigorating. The kids are pumped up, 
you're pumped up. And you've got to make decisions right now." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe Principal Joan Elam said that D'Alessandro will be difficult to replace. 
"He was a great coach who was very sensitive to the young men he worked with," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Elam said the search for a replacement has begun, but there are no deadlines 
set for applicants. Neither of D'Alessandro's assistants -- Joe Lipari and 
Brian McGregor -- teaches on campus, so Elam will look to other schools, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro, a Pepperdine graduate, began his coaching career as an assistant 
at Washington High in 1959 and became the school's head coach 2 years later. He 
compiled a 43-31-6 record in 10 seasons before moving to Fairfax. In 13 seasons 
Fairfax was 78-40-6 and won 5 league titles. Twice he was The Times West Side 
Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he moved to Monroe with co-Coach Howard Reisbord, who shared the job 
until last season. In D'Alessandro's 5 seasons, Monroe was 25-20-2 and won 2 
league titles, including the Mid-Valley championship last fall. 
</P>
<P>
D'Alessandro listed Clarence Davis of the Oakland Raiders among the best 
players he coached. Davis played at Washington and USC before his career in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Scott ranked among the best backs he coached, D'Alessandro said. Scott, 
The Times Valley Player of the Year last season, rushed for 1,943 yards and 
scored 18 touchdowns. In a playoff win over Roosevelt, the Monroe senior tied a 
state record with 54 carries and set the state mark for consecutive carries 
with 22.

<P>
RIBARICH KEY TO PASSING TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
5TH-YEAR SENIOR SHOULDERS LARGE LOAD IN CLASSROOM, ON COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Ribarich plans to carry quite a course load when Cal State Northridge 
begins its spring semester later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Ribarich, an engineering major, is enrolled in 23 units -- the bulk of which 
are upper division. 
</P>
<P>
That's almost twice as many as the 12 units most athletes take during their 
semester of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Classes aren't the only challenge Ribarich will shoulder in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Northridge men's volleyball team opens its season at the 24-team 
UC Santa Barbara Invitational tournament. And Ribarich, a fifth-year senior 
setter, is being charged with the responsibility of engineering the Matadors' 
drive to what would be their first NCAA playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll be one of the best setters in the league," said John Price, who 
begins his fourth season as Matador coach. "He made a big turnaround last year 
and his experience is really going to help us." 
</P>
<P>
If Ribarich can complete all 23 units, he will graduate in May and join his 
brother, John -- a former All-American setter at Hawaii -- playing 
professionally in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
His main concern, however, is keeping Northridge on a season-long high. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Matadors finished 15-9 overall and 7-11 in the powerful 
Division I Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. They fell just short of 
qualifying for a regional berth. 
</P>
<P>
Despite establishing a school record for conference wins, the Northridge 
players had no one to blame but themselves for wasting several opportunities 
that might have landed them in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
After dominating Cal State Long Beach and Stanford in home matches, the 
Matadors lost to both teams with uninspired efforts on the road. Northridge, 
which finished 12th in the Tachikara coaches' poll, beat San Diego State on the 
road then sleepwalked through a home match and lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all part of the learning curve for our program," Price said. "We were 
good last year and the players knew it. The second step was learning that when 
you're good, you have to go hard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
For Ribarich, maturation as a leader had more to do with knowing when to let 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Ribarich was accustomed to success when he arrived at Northridge in 1984. He 
grew up in Brentwood and played volleyball at Palisades High -- a perennial 
City Section power. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really feisty and cocky," Ribarich said before practice Wednesday. "I 
had the totally wrong attitude that a setter needs to have. He has to support 
the team. He has to bring guys up. 
</P>
<P>
"During my first couple years, I'd just rag on people. If they hit a ball out, 
I'd get on their case." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Ribarich's antics, the Northridge coaching staff often resorted to 
similar tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely had what we call the 'Palisades attitude' " said Price, who was 
an assistant coach at the time. "He was cocky beyond realism -- not real 
team-oriented or real concerned what teammates and other people thought. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's evolved into a team, do-anything type of player, and he's capable of 
leading us into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Teammates apparently feel the same way. They elected Ribarich captain of a unit 
that will be without 6-foot, 7-inch middle blocker Jeff Campbell, an honorable 
mention All-American who teamed with 6-6 Robert Samuelson to give Northridge 
one of the most powerful attacks in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell decided to skip his final season of eligibility because of chronic 
knee problems. Had he returned, CSUN would be talented and deep. Without him . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest area it hurts us is depth, not talent," Price said. "We have so 
many fifth-year seniors, there is a real team orientation. There's not as much 
individuality as we have had in past years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're capable of playing as a team this year and that wasn't always the case 
in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Ribarich (6-1), Samuelson, outside hitter Andrew Greskovics and middle blocker 
Ron Graening are fifth-year seniors who will start for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael Tulino, a sophomore middle blocker, and outside hitter Neil Coffman, a 
redshirt sophomore from Chatsworth High and UC Santa Barbara, round out the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Key reserves include hitter Joe Sorenson, a redshirt junior from Pierce; 
freshman middle blocker Mike Marzahl from Reseda High; and setters Tony Rusen, 
a senior, and Matt Unger, a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
After the Santa Barbara Invitational, Northridge will play preconference 
matches against Chapman and UC San Diego. The Matadors open WIVA play Jan. 24 
at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're highly talented," Ribarich said, "I can't see us losing. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in the past has been that not a lot of guys knew what it feels 
like to win. But after last year that should all change."

CROW DELIVERS 24 IN EL CAMINO REAL UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With starting forwards Brent Lofton and Jason Farrell scratched from the 
lineup, El Camino Real High Coach Mike McNulty needed one of his lesser-known 
players to step forward in a Northwest Valley Conference game against Granada 
Hills on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So Charlie Crow, a 6-2 senior, delivered in the clutch at El Camino Real, 
scoring a game-high 24 points in the host Conquistadores' 62-57 upset of the 
Highlanders, the fourth-ranked team in the Times Valley poll. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton (21.9 points a game, 10.3 rebounds) was recovering after collapsing 
Sunday night because of dehydration, and Farrell was out with bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
In their absence, Crow made 10 of 16 field-goal attempts and 4 of 6 free throws 
as El Camino Real (4-5, 1-1 in conference play) snapped a 4-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Steele's basket broke a 48-48 tie early in the fourth period and Granada 
Hills (9-4, 1-1) never recovered. Steele scored 10 of his 14 points in the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
Bertram Mitchell and Mike Stasiak, who replaced Lofton and Farrell in the 
starting lineup, each scored 8 points for El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a half-court trapping defense and it seemed to bother them some," El 
Camino Real assistant Jeff Davis said of Granada Hills. "Our goal was to slow 
down their offensive attack and we accomplished that. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to let them run on offense. You can't let Granada Hills run on 
offense or they'll kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Playing without guard John Johnson (flu) for the second consecutive game, the 
Highlander attack was sluggish. Center Joey Rosas scored 13 points and forwards 
Alvin Brown and Aaron Lattimore added 12 and 11 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Taft 81, Canoga Park 33 -- With Canoga Park's 97-point loss to Cleveland last 
Friday fresh in his mind, Toreador Coach Jim Woodard only played his starters 
in the first and third quarters at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 9 of Taft's 10 players scored, led by Dedan Thomas, who had 25 
points on 10-of-13 shooting from the field. Thomas, who has signed a letter of 
intent to attend Nevada Las Vegas, also had 11 assists and 11 steals. Tony 
Middleton added 13 points and 9 rebounds for Taft (12-1, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Sean Reyes scored 14 points for Canoga Park (2-10, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 54, Birmingham 51 -- Tyrone Craig's 3-point attempt at the 
buzzer would have sent the game into overtime, but the ball caromed off the 
back of the rim and North Hollywood prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Jones led North Hollywood (7-4, 2-0) with 16 points, 7 rebounds and 8 
blocked shots. Ed Davis added 15 points and 7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Craig led Birmingham (5-7, 1-1) with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 57, Reseda 51 -- Forward Setro Terzian snapped out of a season-long slump 
with 17 points and 12 rebounds as the Lancers won at home. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian, who entered the game averaging 6 points, made 7 of 10 field-goal 
attempts and 3 of 9 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Watkins came off the bench to score 17 points on 8-of-16 shooting for 
Grant (9-3, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hawkins scored 17 points and Mike Basowski added 11 for Reseda (3-8, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Poly 50, Van Nuys 47 -- Hugo Parra and Scott Cooper each made 2 free throws in 
the final minute as Poly erased a 47-46 deficit and won at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Parrots trailed, 38-37, after 3 quarters but forced 6 turnovers to ignite 
their fourth-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
Six players scored for Poly in the final quarter. Senior forward John Bruner 
led the Parrots (6-6, 1-1) with 19 points and 7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Foster scored a game-high 20 points for Van Nuys (0-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 79, Sylmar 74 -- Monroe held off a Sylmar rally to win at home. 
</P>

36 MILLION POUNDS OF DIRT MAKE A BIG MESS IN STADIUM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a 6-year-old boy who wanders into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium any 
time during the next few weeks, you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Either that, or you'll think they are filming the world's biggest detergent 
commercial. ("Has your kid ever gotten really dirty ... ?") 
</P>
<P>
 It is every youngster's dream -- and it comes true at some point for most -- 
to frolic in the dirt. Get knee deep in it. Maybe head deep, if you can hold 
your breath. 
</P>
<P>
Throw a little mud in there for good measure, and you've had yourself quite an 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the stadium would be a great place to be. Right now, there is dirt 
as far as the eye can see. Waist-deep dirt. And mud. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this mess -- Whatever happened to the 50-yard line? -- is 
Saturday night's U.S. Hot Rod Motorsports Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought the Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers 
had some behemoths, wait until you get a load of this: 
</P>
<P>
-Monster trucks and tanks, high-powered machines with names such as "Mechanic's 
Nightmare," "Big Foot," "Prosecutor" and "Exterminator." 
</P>
<P>
-Flame-throwing Funny Cars. 
</P>
<P>
-And one car that transforms from a 35-foot long racer to a two-story, talking 
robot. 
</P>
<P>
Fun? Excitement? Well, it all depends on how you look at it. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing's for sure. Only a very large backyard could handle this much 
wild activity. And that's where the dirt comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Lots and lots of dirt. By the time the Mickey Thompson Off-Road event takes 
place in the stadium in a couple of weeks, more than 12,000 yards of dirt will 
have been hauled in to cover the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Because each yard weighs a little more than 1 1/2 tons, that's means at least 
36 million pounds of dirt will be piled upon the field. 
</P>
<P>
"That's enough to give you nightmares," said Steve Wittman, the stadium's head 
groundskeeper. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more. Before the dirt is brought in, workers place about 2,600 
square yards of plastic sheets and 7,800 sheets of plywood on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea is to make sure nothing happens to the field itself," said E.A. 
Rosa, the superintendent for dirt contractor James Kitchens. "We do everything 
we can to make sure the field stays in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
But, Wittman says, there's no way it can remain in "good" condition after it 
takes this kind of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be re-sodding the entire field after the off-road events are over," 
Wittman said. "We have to." 
</P>
<P>
Wittman used to work as the head groundskeeper at Mile High Stadium in Denver, 
and he has been through this before. This weekend's event will be the first 
since the field at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium has been in his care. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, 'Thank goodness I've been through it before,' " Wittman 
said. "That way, I won't have a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Kitchens just finished with an event at Anaheim Stadium. And the company has 
helped create the dirt tracks for most of the off-road events in Southern 
California for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Kitchens gets its dirt from the A-1 Soil Company in Mission 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as good a dirt as we get to use," Rosa said. "In New Oreans, for 
instance, we can only use silt, which is dirt that comes straight out of the 
(Mississippi) River. That stuff is a lot harder to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff we get down here is easier. When we're done with it, we just give it 
back. We use most of the same dirt every year." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa said it takes about 2 days for the company to transform Jack Murphy 
Stadium from a football field to a rather large sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks transport the dirt in and tractors help the contractors create the right 
configurations. 
</P>
<P>
For Saturday's mud-racing competition, Rosa's crew will have to build a pit 150 
feet long, 15 feet wide and 30 inches deep in some parts. The pit will be built 
with dirt and filled with mud. 
</P>
<P>
And adults will be playing around in it instead of kids.

TORREY PINES BREEZES PAST MT. CARMEL

<P>
John Farrell, Torrey Pines High's boys' basketball coach, was sitting just as 
close to the edge of his chair, chewing his gum just as hard and shouting 
instructions just as loudly in the second half as in the first half of his 
team's 95-58 Palomar League victory over Mt. Carmel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he remembered. Last season, Mt. Carmel was the only team to defeat the 
Falcons in the regular season. A learning experience? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Farrell said with a smile. "We learned that they beat us. We don't want 
that to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
If Wednesday's game at Torrey Pines was any indication, it probably won't this 
year. The suspense was over almost as quickly as the national anthem, which the 
Torrey Pines band played briskly in 1 minute 14 seconds. For all practical 
purposes, the Falcons (16-1, 2-0) put the game away about 3 minutes into the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied at 9, Torrey Pines went on a 14-2 run with center Kevin 
Flanagan and guard Kyle Armstrong scoring 6 points apiece. Flanagan scored 23 
first-half points, his high of the season, and finished with 25 after an 
unspectacular second half. Courtie Miller added 22 for the Falcons, Armstrong 
had 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons led, 32-16, at the end of the first quarter, 63-29, at halftime 
and, 81-44, at the end of the third quarter. Armstrong was 4 of 5 from 3-point 
range in the first half. Flanagan led Torrey Pines in rebounding with 10; 
Miller had 9. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel (9-6, 1-2) played without center Shane Knight, who is sick with the 
flu. In last season's Mt. Carmel win, Knight, a slender 6-foot 7-inch forward, 
burned the Falcons with backdoor layups and defensive rebounds. His services 
were sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have Shane next time," said Mt. Carmel Coach John Marincovich about the 
teams' other league meeting. "That will make a difference. We don't have much 
experience after him." 
</P>
<P>
Without Knight, Mt. Carmel was easy pickings for the Falcons, who broke a 
school record of 61 with 63 first-half points. Torrey Pines looked well on its 
way to a 100-point game when Farrell decided to have his team work on 
man-to-man defense and some new offensive schemes. So the second half lacked 
punch, and the entertainment factor waned anyway as the game's 2 dunks came in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"The second half left a lot to be desired," Flanagan said. "I think we tried to 
work on some things that we're probably not as good at." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel was led by 6-3 forward Mike Graves, who scored 10; Jason Mann and 
Mike Herman added 8 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said Torrey Pines had a little extra incentive for this game. Last 
year's game is still clear in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I forget?" he asked. "I was sure we wouldn't lose this one." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines' only loss this year came against Miami Carol City in the final of 
the Palms Tournament 2 weeks ago in Ft. Myers, Fla. The Falcons were 
overmatched against Miami's two 6-10 forwards and its 7-foot center. 
</P>
<P>
"They're solid all the way around," Farrell said. "They've got all the tools 
and they complement each other. They haven't lost a tournament in 5 years." 
</P>
<P>
But here in San Diego, the Falcons are finding few opponents that can stay with 
their quick offense. Morse gave them their closest tussle of the season last 
Saturday in a 3-point Torrey Pines' victory. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, though, doesn't plan to take the Palomar League lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can give you a good game if you're not ready," he said. "This is a 
good league."

The 50th anniversary of American Ballet Theatre (founded in 1940) will be 
celebrated with an 18-month season and a number of special events, artistic 
director Mikhail Baryshnikov said Wednesday in New York. The plans include a 
retrospective of company repertory along with extended U.S. and international 
touring, a traveling exhibition of company memorabilia, a new PBS "Dance in 
America" telecast and a gala performance in New York next January. The company 
also has a new logo: a fuzzy blue ballerina trailing red and white veils. 
Philip Morris Companies Inc. is sponsoring the celebration and national tour

The world premiere of an unpublished musical satire secretly composed nearly 30 
years ago by Dimitri Shostakovich to express his contempt for the Stalinist 
regime will be conducted tonight in Washington by Mstislav Rostropovich, the 
Soviet-born conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. Rostropovich acquired 
a copy of the score and libretto for the 15-minute "Rayok" ("Little Eden") only 
recently, but will not reveal how it fell into his hands. "There are a lot of 
counterfeits around," he says, "but I'm willing to put my life on the line that 
this is Shostakovich's music." ALEENE MacMINN

DEADLINE PUTS FUNDS FOR CAMPUS IN LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California State University officials acknowledged this week that they may miss 
a deadline for spending $7 million earmarked for a Ventura County campus, but 
said there was little chance that funds for the project would dry up. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cal State loses the money if it does not acquire a site before July, 
1990, lawmakers agreed that renewing the allocation would not be a major 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who sponsored the 1985 legislation 
that provided the $7 million, said he would gladly introduce such a bill again. 
And Hart predicted that, barring a severe budget crisis, the money would again 
be available. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can show that some real progress is being made, I think we'll be able to 
persuade the Legislature to keep the ball rolling," he said. "It's not a slam 
dunk or a guarantee . . . but I'm reasonably optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Hart last week introduced legislation for a $900-million educational bond act 
that, if approved by the Legislature and California voters, could give the 
university $400,000 to help develop a West Ventura site. His last bond measure, 
Proposition 78, was approved by voters in November. It earmarked $100,000 for 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State officials had hoped to take steps toward acquiring a portion of 
scenic Taylor Ranch during their quarterly board meeting in Long Beach this 
week. But several studies that they had ordered for the ranch last summer -- 
and that were expected to be completed this month -- still have not been done, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be too difficult to get the deadline extended," said 
Jack Smart, Cal State's vice chancellor for university affairs. "Everything 
seems to take longer than it should." 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the owners of Taylor Ranch threw the search for a campus site into 
turmoil when they announced that they were no longer interested in selling the 
oceanside property. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the Cal State Board of Trustees in July ordered an appraisal and an 
environmental impact report for the ranch -- steps consistent with condemning a 
portion of the hillside land. 
</P>
<P>
Under the California Civil Code, public agencies can acquire properties through 
eminent domain if a project is in the public interest and serves the greatest 
public good while causing the least public injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eminent Domain 
</P>
<P>
Although Cal State officials will not confirm whether they intend to use 
eminent domain, they acknowledge that it is an option. Smart declined to 
predict when those studies will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been wrong so many times in the past," he said. "I don't want to be wrong 
in the future." 
</P>

In comparison, the northern San Diego County campus proposed by Cal State about 
the same time as the Ventura County campus is already in the works. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos site, which was purchased last year, is being graded and readied 
for construction. If work goes according to schedule, classes should begin in 
the fall of 1992, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, Cal State Northridge and UC Santa Barbara have offered classes 
jointly to as many as 1,000 third- and fourth-year students in a cramped office 
building in mid-town Ventura. The Cal State wing of the university center moved 
to a larger facility near Seaward Avenue last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed campus is initially expected to serve 2,500 upper level students 
and, within the next 20 years, could be expanded into a four-year university 
serving 5,000 students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Once a site is acquired, officials said, they will need at least four years for 
planning and development before the first student enters a classroom.

TEEN WRITERS' HEARTS SURFACE IN WINNING PLAYS

<P>
A teen-age boy seeks to spark a friendship into a romance. A man, frustrated 
with his job, reduces his wife to a prisoner. A hapless rich man in the 1930s 
enlists the help of a talented but poor young woman to conceive a musical. Five 
high school runners learn about themselves and one another on a cross-country 
track. A boy agonizes about the choice between applying to the college he wants 
to go to and his father's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the subjects on the minds, hearts and pages of the winning entries in 
the fourth annual California Young Playwrights Competition. Three of the works 
are being presented (through Jan. 22) as full productions at the Gaslamp 
Quarter Theatre Co. The musical "Broads!" and the play "Not What the Doctor 
Ordered" -- the conflict about college applications -- are scheduled as staged 
readings Jan. 25-29. 
</P>
<P>
When the California Young Playwrights Project (CYPP) debuted in 1985 at the 
Gaslamp, even its founder considered it daring. Deborah Salzer, creator and 
project director, remembers being "terrified" after getting the go-ahead from 
co-founders at both the Gaslamp and San Diego city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"For the whole first year, I didn't even believe 
</P>
<P>
the program existed," she said. "I was afraid no one would write scripts and 
afraid no one would show up to see them." 
</P>
<P>
CYPP members began playwrighting workshops in local schools in March, 1984, 
collected plays in June and presented them in January, 1985. Audiences gave 
their approval, and the project, open to all California students under 19, has 
since expanded northward, teaching students in Orange County and Los Angeles as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Salzer's involvement with teen-age artists dates from a decade ago when she was 
working in Harlem to start a theater company for young people. One challenge 
was finding plays with parts for teen-agers. Then she met Gerald Chapman, a 
veteran of a young playwright project in London, whom Stephen Sondheim had 
brought to the United States in 1980 to start the Young Playwrights Festival in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, now deceased, gave Salzer a handful of scripts the Young Playwrights 
Festival had produced for her student theater. In 1982, Salzer took the plays 
with her when she moved to San Diego with her husband, Beeb Salzer, who had 
accepted a teaching post at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the basis of these scripts that Salzer convinced the San Diego city 
schools and Kit Goldman, managing producer of the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, of 
the potential of a young playwrights program. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the strength of the scripts at the Gaslamp has led to what Sarah Luft, 
a producer at KPBS-TV (Channel 15), said may become a young playwrights series 
on the local public broadcasting station. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Luft accompanied her teen-age daughter to the CYPP festival because 
one of her daughter's friends was acting in one of the plays. She was so taken 
with the work that she decided to produce for KPBS the play about the troubled 
maturation of a young Mexican-American girl, "Simply Maria, or the American 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Josefina Lopez of Los Angeles, who wrote the semi-autobiographical "Simply 
Maria," is now in town making revisions for the TV production. Shooting begins 
in March for a summer airing. 
</P>
<P>
At 19, Lopez is now too old to compete in CYPP contests. However, her friend, 
Pamela Mshana, also of Los Angeles, is back for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mshana's "Ebony" told the story of a daughter of an unwed mother who 
tries to escape her mother's fate only to become an unwed mother in turn. Dell 
Books will publish it in a collection next year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Mshana, an 18-year-old sophomore at New York University, addresses 
the issue of a husband abusing his wife in "A Toast to Leslie." 
</P>
<P>
Carla Kirkwood, an Emmy-winning director who was given her choice of CYPP plays 
to direct, said she selected Mshana's work because she was stirred by what 
Mshana was trying to say. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation that Pamela's play deals with conjures up the Joel Steinberg 
case," said Kirkwood, referring to the recent New York trial in which 
Steinberg, a lawyer, was tried for beating his illegally adopted daughter to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
For Lopez, Mshana and Holly Frenzel, the 16-year-old sophomore at El Capitan 
High School in Lakeside who authored "Broads!," the playwrighting contest was 
an introduction to CYPP. The three were among the 2,500 students who started 
their plays because of CYPP workshops in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Searching for the Big Dipper," a story about friendship by Beckie Andersen, 
17, a senior at Crawford High School in San Diego, was used in a workshop 
taught by local playwright Janet Schechter-Tiger. "Runner's High," by Michele 
L. Mitchell, 17, a graduate of Esperanza High in Anaheim who now attends 
Northwestern University, was also developed in a workshop, as was "Not What the 
Doctor Ordered," the story about a boy torn between applying to Stanford -- his 
father's choice -- or to the school he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kirazian, 18, a graduate of Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, who 
wrote "Not What the Doctor Ordered," did not know she would be attending 
Stanford University herself when she based the play on someone she knew in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although CYPP's breadth and approval rating has never been greater, 
the prospective audiences have never been smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Salzer didn't realize that plays with modest casts would translate into modest 
advance ticket sales. Last year, the winning plays had large casts, and the 30 
actors brought friends and teachers to see their work. This year's full 
productions call for a total of 12 actors, some of whom come from SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that the students get a chance to see their work 
professionally mounted in an environment where their work is "respected, valued 
and safe," Salzer said. 
</P>
<P>
At CYPP, the young playwrights get their work seen by critics and read by 
theater professionals. This year, the selection committee included Robert 
Blacker, associate director and dramaturge of La Jolla Playhouse; Jessica 
Teich, literary manager, Mark Taper Forum; David Hay, associate director, Old 
Globe Theatre; Michael Harvey, professor of drama, San Diego State University; 
Margaret McKerrow, professor of drama, SDSU, and Will Simpson, artistic 
director, Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company. 
</P>
<P>
Salzer said the rewards come opening night. 
</P>
<P>
"I always feel wonderful watching the playwrights watching their work," Salzer 
said. "When Josefina (Lopez) was working with us, she got accepted into a 
playwrighting program in New York. The night she had to leave for New York, her 
entire family came down to San Diego to see her play. She sat in a place where 
she could see the show and see her parents, who spoke no English, hoping that 
they would see the love and the humor in the work. Near the end of the play, 
the heroine decides to go off and accept a scholarship. She writes a letter of 
goodby to her family. She thanks them and tells them she will always be Mexican 
in her heart but is leaving to embrace her new country. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point Josefina started weeping because that was exactly what she was 
doing in real life. She was weeping because she was relieved to see that her 
family accepted her play and that she was sitting in a full house that liked 
her work. And I was sitting right next to her, handing her Kleenex and hugging 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy and felt very alive to be a part of this young woman and her 
artistic development. A lot of what rewards me is the nurturing going on. I 
felt like her producer and her San Diego mother and her friend all rolled up 
into one."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK; 
</P>
<P>
THE YEAR SAW GOOD NEWS AND BAD ON HOME FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aglance at San Diego's busy dance calendar for 1988 would suggest that it was a 
very good year for dance on the home front. More big-league ballet companies, 
mainstream moderns and even cutting-edge postmodern dance troupes made stops in 
San Diego than ever before. And, despite the unprecedented onslaught of quality 
imports, local dance managed to hold its ground and even make a few small 
strides. 
</P>
<P>
But the year-end announcement by the San Diego Foundation for the Performing 
Arts (one of the city's leading presenters) that it was canceling two scheduled 
concerts and drastically curtailing operations in the wake of growing deficits, 
caused dance watchers to take a closer look -- and had some insiders wondering 
whether the recent dance boom was headed for a bust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we did too many events this year," said the foundation's guiding 
force, Danah Fayman. "We're presenting 'KODO,' and we'll still do 'David 
Gordon' (a collaborative project with UC San Diego), but there might not be a 
season next year, or we might just have isolated performances." 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Townsend, founding director of San Diego Performances, is more 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The only disappointment we had at the box office last year was with the Martha 
Graham concerts. The rest did very well, and we have $100,000 in proposals out 
for next year," she said. "Of course, if none of them came through, we'd be in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a great deal from the community," she said, "only about 
$400,000, and we hope to get the funding since we do so much community outreach 
with local schoolchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Sushi's Lynn Schuette has presented some of the leading postmodernists in the 
country in her no-frills studio setting over the past few years, and, from her 
vantage point, the prospects for new dance in San Diego are very promising. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, everything has been up over last year. We only have 100 seats to 
fill," she acknowledged, "but we're still building audiences and are very 
satisfied with the response to our programs -- not just dance, all across the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were signs that support is growing for the local product. 
California Ballet extended its season and imported its first long-term guest 
artist, although among the ranks of home-grown dancers, the quality still 
varies considerably. Three's Company's two critically acclaimed appearances in 
San Francisco, and its commitment to a spring concert in New York -- a first 
for any local dance troupe -- improved its image at home. 
</P>
<P>
And two newcomers joined the ranks of area dance groups, most notably John 
Malashock's tight little modern dance troupe. Unfortunately, while female 
dancers are beginning to come of age, the small pool of accomplished male 
dancers in town continues to cause serious imbalances, and limits the 
choreographic range of grass-roots efforts. Among other things, local dance 
needs a few good men before it can move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the San Diego Area Dance Alliance cast a rather skimpy shadow on the 
local horizon. Only its bimonthly calendar of events and those marathon dance 
festivals attested to its existence. 
</P>
<P>
But 1988 brought the alliance out of obscurity. First, it hosted a successful 
statewide meeting of dance professionals, which went a long way toward putting 
San Diego on the California map. Then, the alliance came up with the Performing 
Arts Laboratory project -- to showcase all levels of dance on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
The PAL project will present its third concert Jan. 15. at Sushi's downtown 
gallery. True to its original intent, this PAL concert will feature a potpourri 
of local dancers performing works by several choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Los Angeles-based Laurie Sefton will join the home team with her own 
Clairobscur Dance Company. Judith Sharp, Alison Cutri, Sandra Mangusing and 
Terry Sprague will make PAL debuts this Sunday also, while both Al Germani and 
Darshana Ellis return for their third PAL-sponsored appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of PAL is to offer a space in which to present works in progress as 
well as polished pieces, without the pressure and financial obligations full 
evening concerts afford our independent artists," said Sharp, coordinator of 
this innovative program. "The costs are minimal and so far have been absorbed 
by the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
PAL has even generated several new members for the alliance, and, according to 
Sharp, the fringe benefits keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of PAL is not only because of the excitement generated among the 
dancers, choreographers and artists involved, but in the variety of the 
audience members," she said. "And I personally hope to spread the word among 
the other arts for an increased cross-section representation. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no screening process for the artists, and experimentation is 
encouraged, the quality of PAL performances can vary as much as the 
programming, but that hasn't discouraged sellout crowds. Sunday's performance 
will begin at 3 p.m., followed by an informal reception and discussion with the 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta-based Celeste Miller bills herself as the "Talking Dancer," so expect 
some patter in her solo performance when she makes her local debut at Sushi on 
Friday and Saturday evenings. Storytelling, zany graphics, offbeat props and 
contemporary dance motifs are part and parcel of Miller's "Lost and Found in 
America: Some of the Stories," the series of three semi-autobiographical pieces 
headed our way this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Like the recent Sushi visitor Tim Miller (no relation), Miller culls her 
material from the innocent and painful memories of growing up in America.

SCHOOLS FOCUS ATTENTION ON KOREAN INFLUX 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Lori Kim moved to Los Angeles from her native Korea in 1973, she was a shy 
12th-grader bewildered by Hollywood High School and faced with the difficult 
task of learning the English language. 
</P>
<P>
It did not help, said Kim, who is now a 31-year-old Glendale schoolteacher, 
that her teachers made little effort to get to know her or her culture. It did 
not help that there were no Korean teachers to help with her studies. And after 
a childhood in Korea where educators, she said, spend a good deal of time 
visiting students' homes, it did not help that American teachers kept their 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with the population of Korean students in Glendale schools rapidly 
multiplying, Kim has joined with district officials to make sure a new 
generation of young immigrants do not repeat her experience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 1/2-Hour Conference 
</P>
<P>
One outcome of their efforts will take place today, a 5 1/2-hour conference 
meant to bring together district educators and Korean parents to listen to 
lectures on Korean culture and to share a little food, dance and song from a 
culture that dates back more than 5,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first of its kind in California, said Alice Petrossian, 
director of intercultural education for the district. A cooperative effort of 
the district and the Los Angeles-based Korean American Educators Assn., it is a 
prototype of a program the association hopes to repeat at schools throughout 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"My point is, the Koreans are coming and we better find out about them before 
we find ourselves in the same situation we did with the Armenians," Petrossian 
said. "We were unprepared for the Armenians and look where that got us -- 
chaos. We don't want that to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Coming they are. 
</P>
<P>
While the increase in the number of Korean students in the district does not 
compare to the sudden influx of Armenian refugees to Glendale schools in the 
past year, the growth is significant, with new Korean students enrolling 
steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Koreans were the district's sixth-largest minority group. Today 
they are the third, Petrossian said, outnumbered only by Latinos and Armenians. 
And district records show that since last August, when the district established 
an orientation center to help immigrant students, more than 13% of the students 
coming through its doors have been Korean. 
</P>
<P>
At Crescenta Valley High School, the cluster of Korean students in one corner 
of the schoolyard is nothing new. Neither are the long cafeteria tables filled 
with Korean faces, Principal Kenneth Bierman said. But the clusters are getting 
larger and the tables are getting crowded, he said. Last year, the school's 
Korean Club had a membership of 20. This year its membership has grown to 60, 
club faculty adviser June Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are more Koreans coming in right now," said Jim McLashen, 
director of testing and evaluation for the district. "There's certainly been a 
significant increase over the last eight years. And anytime you have a large 
number of immigrants, in order to make them feel more comfortable you try to 
get out there to the community, to make sure the kids get the kind of education 
their parents want." 
</P>
<P>
What the parents of the district's more than 2,000 Korean students want, Kim 
said, is often significantly different from what the school district can 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Up to the Professionals' 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea, parents leave education up to the professionals," Kim said. "The 
parents think it is their place to just cooperate, not to get involved in the 
schools the way American parents do. In Korea, even suggesting anything to the 
school sort of meant that you're saying the school isn't doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Kim said the conference is a way to get the parents involved. And many have 
responded enthusiastically. While the conference is being funded by the 
district, more than $900 has been donated for the program from Korean parents, 
Petrossian said. It was also the idea of parents to serve the educators and 
administrators attending the conference a traditional Korean dinner of 
dumplings, noodles, barbecue and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they have long known they could be doing more to help 
Glendale's Korean students. Since 1981, when the South Korean government began 
sponsoring educational junkets, 28 Glendale educators have traveled to the 
country along with teachers from throughout the United States and Canada. And 
Korean clubs have long been a fixture of many district schools. 
</P>
<P>
But while there are more than 2,100 Korean students in Glendale schools, the 
district has only two Korean-speaking teachers. And with district educators 
frantic to help the rapidly growing population of Armenian students, there has 
been little time for teachers to learn about Korean culture, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruited by District 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who last taught at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, was recruited three 
years ago by Glendale district officials in part because of her Korean 
background, Petrossian said. Since then, the high school chemistry teacher has 
been something of an informal counselor and Korean community liaison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unwritten requirement of the job," Kim said. "The Koreans think that 
we are all family and we are supposed to help one another. They take a big 
pride that I am a teacher in the American educational system -- and they trust 
me with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, a member of the Korean American Educators Assn., proposed the conference 
to district officials last fall. Since then, she has been working with the 
intercultural education office to put it together. The program will include 
lectures by teachers in Los Angeles and Torrance who have long dealt with large 
Korean student populations, a talk by the Korean government attache on 
education, Hyung Kee Sun, and a talk on Korean immigration to the United States 
by Korean American Educators Assn. President Jung Hae Kim. 
</P>
<P>
"People are finally realizing that, OK, there are many Koreans in Glendale," 
Kim said. "At the same time, the Koreans are talking about getting more 
involved. They are beginning to feel they are needed."

SOUTH GATE OKS PLAN TO IMPROVE WATER SYSTEM

SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a $20-million plan, which will result in higher 
water bills, to finance a $5.5-million water-treatment plant and other 
improvements in the city's 60-year-old water system, which has lost 55% of its 
water supply because of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The financing package would increase the typical monthly residential water bill 
from $9.38 to a high of $27.44 by the year 1999, city officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-0 Monday to sell city-backed certificates of participation, 
a municipal financing tool much like bonds, to raise $11 million to build the 
water treatment plant at South Gate Recreation Park, construct a storage and 
pumping facility on the city's Westside, and replace rusting pipeline. Revenues 
from water bills would be used to pay off the certificates. 
</P>
<P>
"A pay-as-you-go method would have taken us five to six years to raise enough 
to build the treatment plant," said Councilman William H. DeWitt. "We need the 
project now." Since 1985, six wells have been closed because of chemical 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $9 million more would be raised over the next 11 years through 
increased water bills to pay for additional pipeline replacements and other 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The city has one of the area's more serious water pollution problems. Since 
1985, six wells have been closed after tests found that an industrial solvent 
in the water was at a higher level than recommended by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The last well was closed Dec. 19. State officials have stated that even though 
the chemical is suspected of causing cancer in humans, the exposure had been so 
brief that it posed very little risk to residents. 
</P>
<P>
State guidelines recommend closing a well or cleaning or mixing its water when 
the level of tetracholorethylene , a degreasing industrial solvent in all six 
wells, reaches 4 parts per billion. The levels in the closed wells have ranged 
from 5.3 to 9 parts per billion. 
</P>
<P>
More details on the treatment plant should be available at the council's Feb. 
13 meeting, said Rollie D. Berry, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will be built in South Gate Recreation Park, near four of the six 
contaminated wells. The other two wells, located elsewhere in the city, are 
expected to receive treatment in the future. The city has tested a number of 
treatment methods, but has yet to settle on a specific one, Berry said. The 
city must also set a date for the sale of the certificates.

BELLFLOWER OKS FORMATION OF RENEWAL AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BELLFLOWER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, exercising the authority granted to it two months ago by 
voters of this mostly residential community, unanimously approved the formation 
of a Community Redevelopment Agency in an effort to improve the city's 
financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they hoped the Monday night council vote would end years of 
controversy that once sharply divided residents, business leaders and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real opportunity for Bellflower," said City Administrator Jack A. 
Simpson, who has argued that a redevelopment agency would be a "valuable tool" 
in attracting new retail business and upgrading the city's downtown shopping 
district. "I hope all that (past controversy) is behind us now." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over a proposed redevelopment agency arose in the early 1980s. 
Redevelopment supporters have argued that an agency would ensure that the city 
remains competitive for sales-tax dollars while opponents have complained that 
an agency would wield too much power over property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday's vote, Bellflower was one of three Southeast cities with no 
redevelopment agency. Nearby Artesia and La Habra Heights have no such 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have spoken," said Councilman Joseph E. Cvetko, who once staunchly 
opposed formation of a redevelopment agency but joined the other council 
members in this week's council decision. "The people voted it in, you have to 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
The new law becomes effective Feb. 9. The council members will also serve as 
board members of the redevelopment agency, which will direct renewal projects 
and seek to draw potential retail development into the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the dispute over whether such an agency is a blessing or a bane to the city 
of 60,000 residents is far from over, said redevelopment opponents, who 
launched a petition drive Tuesday morning to force a special election. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of requests (to begin gathering signatures)," said Ruth 
Gilson, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against Another Redevelopment Plan. 
</P>
<P>
CAARP officials, who campaigned against three initiatives that were narrowly 
passed in the Nov. 8 general election, claim that many voters were confused. 
</P>
<P>
They said that a number of residents complained after the election, saying they 
voted yes on Propositions Q, R and S in the belief that they were keeping 
intact a 5-year-old law that prevented the council from forming an agency 
without voter approval. Voters, fearing an agency would have the power to take 
their homes, passed that 1983 prohibition by a 4-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 51.3% of 16,000 voters favored the ballot measure rescinding the 
1983 law. CAARP officials contend that the final tally was too close to prove 
that a majority of residents now support an agency. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were just plain confused," Gilson said Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Besides voting to give the council power to create a redevelopment agency, 
residents also voted to prohibit a redevelopment agency from condemning 
residential property, and to designate a U-shaped corridor along Lakewood, 
Artesia and Bellflower boulevards as a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draft of Bylaws 
</P>
<P>
Next month, city officials will present a draft of the new agency's bylaws to 
the council for approval. After that, public hearings will be scheduled, 
Simpson said. Simpson, who will act as redevelopment agency executive director, 
said no additional city personnel will be hired to staff the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of the agency could take up to a year, said city officials, who 
added that they have yet to decide how the agency would be funded. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency fund, which could be raised through the selling of 
special municipal bonds or through loans from the city's general fund, is used 
to finance initial land acquisition. The property could then be given to 
developers or offered at reduced cost as an incentive to build in the city. The 
agency later receives a percentage of the increased tax revenue from 
redeveloped property to finance new projects. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said the agency's first endeavor probably would be an auto mall on 
Artesia Boulevard, which parallels the Artesia Freeway. City officials last 
year warned that the city's handful of car dealerships, the largest source of 
tax revenue, would relocate to auto malls in Signal Hill and nearby Cerritos if 
there were no efforts to keep dealers in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep these (dealerships) in the city," Mayor Kenneth J. Cleveland 
said, adding that the city faces financial trouble without redevelopment. "If 
we can get one good project going and show the people what can be done (through 
redevelopment), we will have no resistance." 
</P>
<P>
But Gilson's husband, Dale, who co-founded CAARP in the summer after the 
council agreed to put the initiatives on the November ballot, disputed 
Cleveland's claim that the city would suffer financially without an agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continue the Fight 
</P>
<P>
He told the council Monday night that he would continue the fight to block 
establishment of an agency in the city through a special election. 
</P>
<P>
"You all know how I stand on redevelopment," Dale Gilson told the council. "I 
don't think the (issue) is dead. " 
</P>
<P>
Gilson has charged that the city acted improperly during the campaign by siding 
with redevelopment advocates. He filed a complaint with the Fair Political 
Practices Commission before the election, contending that city officials 
"misappropriated public funds" in their alleged support of the three 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The city spent more than $6,000 in preparing informational brochures and hiring 
redevelopment experts to answer questions during a series of public sessions at 
the 675-seat William Bristol Civic Auditorium, Simpson said. Redevelopment 
opponents claimed that the information sponsored by the city was one-sided, 
containing no anti-redevelopment views. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who once published a pro-redevelopment column in a local newspaper, 
has maintained that city officials remained neutral during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
State election law forbids city officials to take a formal stand on an 
initiative and to spend city funds to support a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the CAARP petition, which will be mailed to households in the city, Gilson 
continued his claim that the city acted unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore circulating this petition to gain the right to a fair and 
honest election -- where the truth will prevail," Gilson wrote in the petition. 
He said that the commission has yet to take action on his complaint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return Envelope 
</P>
<P>
The mail-in petitions, paid for by unspent CAARP campaign funds, will include a 
return envelope for residents to send in signed petitions. CAARP officials hope 
to gather 3,500 signatures by the beginning of February, 700 more than the 
required 2,800 signatures needed to force a special election. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Cleveland, who has been a longtime redevelopment supporter, said the 
Gilsons and other redevelopment opponents are "beating a dead horse" by 
continuing their effort to block formation of an agency. 
</P>
<P>
"They lost," Cleveland said. "We came up from a very deep hole and we won. We 
can make a lot better community if we pull together."

EX-NORWALK OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Norwalk City Administrator William H. Kraus was sentenced in federal 
court in San Diego to five years' probation and fined $1,000 for his part in a 
land-fraud scheme that bilked investers out of more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus, 50, is also required to pay $20,000 in restitution over the next 4 1/2 
years to victims. U.S. District Judge Rudi M. Brewster sentenced Kraus on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The former city administrator pleaded guilty in 1987 to one count of mail 
fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $1,000 
fine. But in an interview this week, Kraus maintained he was not involved in 
the scam and that he was held responsible for the actions of a co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had had the resources to have legally fought it all the way, the 
determination would have been different," said Kraus, who resigned from his 
Norwalk post in 1983 after questions arose about personal business dealings 
unrelated to the current case. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus and seven other men were charged in 1985 with 23 counts of mail fraud in 
the use of two companies, one in California and one in Utah, to defraud 
investors. Some of the victims lost money by purchasing real estate at 
artificially inflated prices. The majority lost money by investing in a company 
that promised a 36% to 48% annual return based on what turned out to be a 
series of phony transactions. 
</P>
<P>
In all, from 50 to 100 investors lost about $3.6 million. The victims were from 
California, Utah and other states. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael R. Pent, the prosecutor in the case, said 
Kraus received a relatively light sentence because he played a limited role in 
the fraud ring and because he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Pent said 
Kraus would have testified against his co-defendants had they been tried. 
</P>
<P>
"We did evaluate his culpability as less than the others," Pent said. "We 
informed the court that he did cooperate in the manner we requested. As far as 
we know, he was ready to testify as per the (plea) agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The charge to which Kraus pleaded guilty involved a single San Diego County 
property. Pent said Kraus allowed a beach condominium to be bought under his 
name in 1981. He then transferred the title to a co-defendant, and paid for 
appraisals that greatly inflated the property's worth, Pent said. 
</P>
<P>
Two investors in the property lost about $50,000, said Pent, who added that 
there was no proof Kraus made any money off the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus left his Norwalk job in 1983 after a decade as the city's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus said he is now self-employed, running a Garden Grove firm called William 
H. Kraus &amp; Associates. The firm manages three nonprofit associations in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus has a Ph.D. in public administration and taught a class called 
"Foundations of Non-Profit Association Management" as recently as last year at 
California State University, Long Beach. A university spokeswoman said Kraus is 
not scheduled to teach at the university during the spring semester. Kraus said 
he will teach at three Southern California colleges this spring but he declined 
to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Sentenced 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant was sentenced along with Kraus on Monday. Charles Carrasco, a 
former member of the Del Mar Fair Board, received a 90-day sentence, was fined 
$100 and paid $10,000 in restitution, Pent said. Carrasco pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor obstruction of the mails, which carries a maximum sentence of six 
months in jail and a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The restitution money will go into a fund that will be divided among the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Four other defendants in the case are scheduled to be sentenced next month and 
in May on charges ranging from mail fraud to accessory after the fact to mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution of another defendant has been deferred and will be dropped if 
he pays $30,000 in restitution and serves community service, Pent said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another defendant, Lynn Dale Bogart of San Diego pleaded guilty in 1986 to 
one count of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He is 
serving a 10-year prison term on those charges and a separate counterfeiting 
charge.

ART CENTER PACKAGING CLASS CREATES PROTOTYPES OF PORTABLE HOMES FOR THE 
HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With a couple of quick motions and a flick of the wrist, Sterling Marshall 
tucked his final exam under his arm, portfolio-style, to demonstrate how it 
could meet a homeless person's need for a portable shelter. 
</P>
<P>
He was carrying a human-sized, waterproof corrugated cardboard contraption that 
opened to form a tent for sleeping and closed into a compact, easy-to-carry 
package. 
</P>
<P>
At the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Marshall's creation passed the 
final exam for his advanced packaging class. He was among five graduating 
seniors assigned to produce individual shelters for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out to where the homeless were, to see where and how they slept," said 
Marshall, a Pasadena resident. He said the students also checked with missions 
and agencies serving homeless people before they came up with five designs in a 
variety of materials. 
</P>
<P>
The shelters had to withstand rain, wind and dirt, yet be lightweight, compact 
and able to maintain body warmth. They had to be made with inexpensive 
materials that would be durable for about a week. 
</P>
<P>
Although the students' involvement with the shelters ended with their designs, 
they said they hoped manufacturers and donors of materials would produce the 
shelters, which could be distributed by missions, food kitchens and other 
relief organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the students targeted a particular type of homeless person -- 
"those who come here looking for a better way of life and happen to be sleeping 
under cars or park benches for a few days until they can find employment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to promote the homeless situation, we just want to give a 
helping hand." 
</P>
<P>
John Ochoa, executive director of the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the 
Homeless, an organization of agencies and community leaders offering aid to the 
homeless, lauded the students' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about what I hear," Ochoa said when told of the project. "We never 
have received such a proposal but would be interested in looking into what 
these students have done. If they would like to meet with me, I would be 
delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said he was especially pleased that students showed an interest in the 
homeless. "That probably is more important than the product itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's cardboard "tent" was painted with a camouflage design that would 
blend with urban surroundings but would be easily identifiable and not mistaken 
as "just another piece of cardboard." Strips of Velcro keep it in shape. He 
estimated the manufacturing cost at $20. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Ashworth designed a garment that looked like a spacesuit, complete with an 
inflatable hood to serve as a pillow, using Mylar, a thin but strong material. 
The shiny silver suit could be compacted to the size of a fist and would cost 
an estimated $5, she said. "Sometimes homeless people have to move in a hurry, 
and they could walk away in this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Newport Beach, Ashworth said her inspiration for a protective 
suit first came three years ago when she was visiting San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so shocked to see girls my age sleeping on public bathroom floors," she 
said. "Since then I've wanted to do something to help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Designs 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wilks of San Diego and Gregorio Amaro of El Paso, Tex., made shelters 
of polyfoam that looked like sleeping bags. Each weighed about five pounds and 
would cost about $15 to manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
David Clark of Burley, Ida., produced what appeared to be an attache case -- a 
black box with a handle that stretched into a human-sized accordion-pleated 
tunnel. It had a built-in foam pad and was sealed against the elements with a 
wax spray. Clark estimated its cost at $15. 
</P>
<P>
Although graduating and about to begin new jobs, the students said they hoped 
to continue their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been emotionally involved with poor people, so this is what I'll 
pursue," Amaro said. 
</P>
<P>
"The is the direction I want to go," Wilks said.

MOTORIST ACCUSED OF KILLING 4 PEDESTRIANS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A part-time maintenance worker accused of killing four pedestrians in Glendale 
has been ordered to stand trial later this month in Pasadena Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of William K. Conway, 27, is scheduled to begin Jan. 24. Conway is 
charged with four counts of manslaughter and two counts of causing an accident 
with injuries while driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of a preliminary hearing Monday, Glendale Municipal Court 
Commissioner Joseph F. De Vanon ruled that a prosecutor had presented 
sufficient evidence to bring Conway to trial. Before ruling, De Vanon called 
the case a "horrible, horrible tragedy from any angle you look at it." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Conway, an employee of the Glendale parks and recreation 
division, could be sentenced to a maximum of 17 years and eight months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members of 2 Families 
</P>
<P>
Police said Conway was driving south on Canada Boulevard near Verdugo Road 
about 8:30 p.m. July 13 when his car struck members of two families waiting on 
a traffic island to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Cramer, 32; her daughter, Brianna, 9; Patricia Carr, 36, and her 
daughter, Karen, 6, all of Glendale, were killed. Cramer's son, Billy, 11, 
suffered a broken finger and an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Conway's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Michael Allensworth, 
challenged the California Highway Patrol's figure for his client's speed at the 
time of the accident and the validity of the blood-alcohol tests that police 
gave him. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on the testimony of forensics expert William Painter, Allensworth 
argued that Conway's car was not traveling 79.2 m.p.h., as the California 
Highway Patrol had concluded, when it hit the traffic island. Painter estimated 
the car's speed at 65 m.p.h. The speed limit where the accident occurred is 35 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Allensworth argued that blood-alcohol tests given to Conway by Glendale police 
were not conclusive. Conway's blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.15% about 
an hour after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timing Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Allensworth said the amount of time that lapsed between the accident and the 
testing raised doubts about the accuracy of the results. 
</P>
<P>
California law presumes that a motorist is driving drunk if he or she has a 
blood-alcohol content of 0.10% or greater within three hours of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Several accident witnesses, police officers, coroners and a Los Angeles Police 
Department criminologist testified Friday, the first day of the preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James E. Rogan said the testimony of the 14 prosecution 
witnesses and other evidence would be sufficient to prove that Conway's 
blood-alcohol level was high when his car struck the two families and that his 
car was traveling at a high rate of speed. 
</P>
<P>
Conway is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail.

OCCIDENTAL MARKS DEMOCRACY IN W. GERMANY, MARSHALL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials and representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany 
met at the Occidental College in Eagle Rock on Tuesday evening to begin the 
city's yearlong commemoration of the Marshall Plan and West Germany's 40 years 
of democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
In brief remarks to an audience of about 50 people, West German Deputy Consul 
General Klaus Rupprecht thanked Americans for the foresight and generosity that 
made democracy possible in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Keynote speaker Lawrence Mihlon, whose coming novel "Out of the Ashes" is set 
in the reconstruction period, summarized the Marshall Plan and the development 
of West German democracy as "a time of vision and courage the like of which the 
United States may not see again." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre used the event to propose a new 
Marshall Plan for the poor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The reception marked the opening in the Occidental College library of a 
traveling exhibit on the Marshall Plan, the U.S. aid program that set the stage 
for democracy in the shattered postwar nations of Europe through economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit consists of dramatic photos of a devastated Europe -- battered 
cities, hungry children, displaced people grubbing for coal in icy fields -- 
and more optimistic pictures of rebirth -- buildings being erected, people 
eating, coal miners working with pneumatic tools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figures of the Mid-Century 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the immediately grasped picture story are drab shots of 
almost-forgotten figures of the mid-century such as British Foreign Secretary 
Ernest Bevin, French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, Soviet Foreign Minister 
V.M. Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Among the photos are a scattering of documents, including a copy of the 
typewritten text from which Marshall read as he proposed the historic plan in a 
short address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is produced by the German Marshall Plan Fund, an organization that 
promotes scholarship and appreciation for the program that is considered 
America's boldest and most successful foreign policy achievement of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
It has been traveling to universities and museums around the United States 
since 1987, the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, and reached Los Angeles 
in December, first staying two weeks in UCLA's International Student Center. It 
will move to Cal State Northridge later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Its arrival in Los Angeles brought the celebration of European recovery to a 
new phase, keying on the 1949 adoption of the West German Constitution, known 
as the Basic Law. 
</P>
<P>
Through the formation of the Out of the Ashes committee, Los Angeles became the 
nation's first city to honor the anniversary of West German constitutional 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Jurgen Pelzer, an associate professor at Occidental, arranged 
for the exhibit and reception at the Eagle Rock campus as a double celebration 
for the Marshall Plan and the Basic Law of his native West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At Occidental, the commemoration will continue with a film festival on U.S. and 
West German relations and a panel discussion in the fall on political issues, 
Pelzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Los Angeles, the Out of the Ashes committee will sponsor German jazz 
festivals, radio broadcasts and a conference on European democracy.

DAY TO LEAVE COUNCIL; DOOR OPEN FOR FLOOD OF CONTENDERS

<P>
John F. Day, a member of the Glendale City Council for 12 years, announced this 
week that he will step down from the post, opening the door to a potential 
flood of candidates in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there long enough," said Day, 69, who announced his decision Monday 
after returning from a two-week trip to Portugal and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Day, the only Democrat on the five-member council, said he decided not to seek 
a fourth term because he wants "to give someone else, with perhaps a different 
outlook, an opportunity to serve the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Day has grown increasingly contentious in recent months, particularly toward 
council member Ginger Bremberg, who is quick to return the fire. But Day said 
his frequent disagreements with other members were not a factor in his decision 
to quit. "We disagree with each other -- sometimes vociferously -- but there is 
nothing personal in it," Day said. "It's disagreement on issues, rather than 
personalities, and that's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up for Reelection 
</P>
<P>
Two other council members whose terms are up -- Bremberg and Mayor Carl W. 
Raggio -- are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
So far, four challengers have entered the race for the three council seats 
since the candidate filing period opened Jan. 5. They are Robin Westmiller, 
Shirley Yap Griffin, Vito Cannella and Richard C. Diradourian. The filing 
period for the April 4 election closes Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Westmiller, 35, is a community volunteer and serves on the board of directors 
of Glendale's Human Relations Council. A resident of southeast Glendale, she 
said she wants "to get government back to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, 50, represents the College Hills Homeowners Assn. for the Glendale 
Hills Coordinating Council, an umbrella group of homeowner activists. She is 
critical of rapid growth in the city and said council members have been too 
permissive toward developers. 
</P>
<P>
Cannella, 60, a member of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission and 
a Glendale parking commissioner, picked up nomination papers last week but said 
Tuesday that he is considering dropping out of the race. A Montrose barber who 
ran unsuccessfully for the council in 1975, Cannella said he has been ill with 
the flu and unable to collect the signatures required for nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Diradourian, 40, is an architect and treasurer of the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He said he is seeking election 
because he feels that he "would add a dimension to the council with my 
expertise in a number of areas -- the moratorium, toxic waste, housing for the 
elderly." He said he is not a member of, nor is he endorsed by, a building 
industry coalition formed to oppose the existing construction moratorium. 
However, Diradourian was among a large group of speakers who voiced opposition 
to the moratorium before the council in October. 
</P>
<P>
With one seat vacant, more candidates, who may have been reluctant to compete 
with incumbents, are now expected to enter the campaign, City Hall officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have been just waiting" for Day's decision, said Bremberg, who 
added that she has "heard as many as 15 names" of potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Express Interest 
</P>
<P>
Several community and civic leaders have expressed interest in running for the 
council but have yet to file papers. They include Gerald W. Briggs, 49, a 
12-year veteran of the Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals, and 
Richard Jutras, 49, former Planning Commission chairman who has led a citizens 
advisory committee on zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Nida Solana Brown, 54, a former zoning and planning commissioner, announced her 
candidacy Wednesday. A probate attorney, Brown is a close friend of Day, who 
appointed her to the commission positions. 
</P>
<P>
Also considering entering the race is developer Joe Ayvazi, who won the support 
of the council for his proposal to preserve the historic Goode House in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Robert K. Holmes, a trustee of Glendale Community College for six years who was 
considered a likely candidate for the council, announced Wednesday that he will 
not be a contender, citing the amount of time required of council members. 
Holmes, an attorney, said: "It would not be fair to the voters to have me as a 
part-time council person. That is a full-time volunteer job which I am not 
ready for at this stage in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Key issues in the race are expected to revolve around growth and to focus on 
traffic congestion, parking limitations, overdevelopment and a moratorium on 
apartment and condominium construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Moratorium 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg, the only woman on the council, said she is seeking a third term 
because "there are too many issues that have not been resolved and I would like 
to see them through." She mentioned the proposed downtown hotel, construction 
moratorium and implementation of a traffic management plan. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio, who is conducting his first reelection campaign, said: "I want to make 
sure the city of Glendale retains its quality of life." He too is concerned 
about traffic management and development of the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
Voters on April 4 will also fill three expired terms on the boards of both the 
Glendale Unified School District and Glendale Community College. All six 
incumbents are seeking reelection, and only one challenger had requested 
nomination papers by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Incumbents Running 
</P>
<P>
Seeking reelection in the school district, which governs elementary through 
secondary education, are Charles E. Whitesell, board president who is seeking 
his second term in office; June F. Sweetnam, a three-term veteran, and Jane M. 
Whitaker, in quest of her third term. 
</P>
<P>
The sole challenger in the school district race is Richard N. Matthews, vice 
president of corporate communications for the Carnation Co., who has long 
expressed interest in politics in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent candidates in the college district are Phillip C. Kazanjian, an 
attorney seeking his second term; Ted W. Tiffany, principal of Daily High 
School in Glendale who has served two terms, and Kenneth N. Sweetnam (no 
relation to June Sweetnam), a retired administrator of Cal State Los Angeles 
who is bidding for his third term. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Aileen B. Boyle, acting city clerk, is so far running unopposed 
for the position formerly held by Merle H. Hagemeyer, and City Treasurer 
Elizabeth W. Evans said she will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible, candidates must submit petitions with the signatures of 500 
registered voters to the Glendale city clerk by 5 p.m. Jan. 26. Candidates are 
charged a $25 filing fee and must pay a $400 deposit for a ballot statement.

<P>
HEARING WILL EXPLORE USES OF FEDERAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Community Advisory Board will hold a hearing Tuesday to receive public 
comment on how about $850,000 in federal funds should be spent in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 13 years, the federal government has given Pico Rivera Community 
Development Block Grants. The money has been used for rehabilitation of homes 
and commercial buildings, code enforcement, alley improvements, parks and the 
Senior Citizen/Art Center now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Projects eligible for funding must either provide benefits to low- or 
moderate-income people or to eliminate slum or help improve blighted 
conditions. The hearing will begin at 7 p.m. at the Recreation and Community 
Services Building, 6767 S. Passons Blvd.

NO-SMOKING RULES ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday adopted the most stringent smoking ordinance in the 
San Gabriel Valley. It will significantly restrict smoking in most public 
buildings and in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will take effect in 30 days, except in workplaces, where 
employers have an additional 60 days to formulate smoking policies required 
under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
It prohibits smoking in elevators, hospitals and health care facilities, public 
meeting places, theaters, auditoriums, public restrooms and service lines. In 
the workplace, smoking is barred in a businesses' common areas and allows 
non-smokers to designate their immediate workplace a non-smoking area. The 
wishes of the non-smoker take precedence in settling disputes. 
</P>
<P>
For restaurants of 50 seats or more, the ordinance requires that 50% of the 
seating be designated for non-smoking. Bars and smaller restaurants are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is modeled after a Pasadena law passed in 1984, but it doubles 
Pasadena's requirement that restricts 25% of a restaurant's seating for 
non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Hitt offered an amendment to require that smoking sections be 
located in the back of restaurants so non-smokers could avoid walking through 
smoke. Hitt's amendment will be considered in February.

SUIT OVER SCHOOL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The often-divided City Council has voted unanimously to file a lawsuit against 
the Alhambra School District, charging that a plan to expand crowded San 
Gabriel High School is ill-conceived and injurious to residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The school, San Gabriel's primary public high school, is actually in Alhambra, 
just across San Gabriel's western boundary. The district plans to build a new 
cafeteria, increase classroom capacity by more than 300 students and build a 
parking lot with access onto Fairview Avenue in a residential section of San 
Gabriel known as the Village. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Stephanie Scher said an environmental impact statement prepared by 
the district gives little indication how many students would be assigned to the 
school, which city officials say already has 50% more students than it was 
designed to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Village residents worry that their streets will be flooded with school-related 
traffic. "The problem is that it would dump traffic onto the streets all at one 
time, like opening a spigot," said City Administrator Robert Clute. 
</P>
<P>
The council and the district have held numerous negotiating sessions on the 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"They've turned a deaf ear on us," said Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak. 
</P>
<P>
Scher said the suit would be filed before the end of the week in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
District officials declined to comment.

THEATER CHAINS INVITED TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying there are plenty of Long Beach residents who would flock to a downtown 
movie theater complex -- if one existed -- the local Redevelopment Agency is 
asking major theater operators to submit proposals for an 8- to 14-screen 
cinema complex. It would be constructed within a redevelopment area bounded by 
1st and 3rd streets, Pacific Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard on land that the 
agency would sell to the operator. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's old theaters have closed or been demolished over the years, 
leaving a dearth of movie theaters in most parts of Long Beach. The city's only 
two major complexes are both located in the southeast corner, on Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment officials say a number of major theater operators are convinced 
there is a strong local market to support a downtown complex as large as 14 
screens. The city has long envisioned theaters as an important piece of the 
downtown redevelopment picture.

DRUG EDUCATION PROJECT EXPANDED TO 8TH GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Downey City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the expansion of the 
Drug Abuse Resistance &amp; Education (DARE) program to middle schools 
throughout the Downey Unified School District. It will go into effect in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the DARE program has been geared to fifth-graders, providing 
information on drug misuse, alternatives and ways to promote self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will double the number of students involved, to more than 2,000 
fifth- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the program is effective," said Robert Cosgrove, administrator of 
curriculum and instruction for Downey schools. The prevailing attitude among 
students who witness the program is drugs are "not a smart thing to do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey Police Department is adding another officer to the program, now 
represented by Cynthia Billings. The estimated cost for the additional officer, 
who will assist Billings in advance of the fall semester, is $50,000. "There is 
only one way to stop drug traffic and that is to steal its customers," said 
Mayor Robert Cormack, who views DARE as a method to improve students' life and 
life expectancy.

4% HIKE IN RESIDENTIAL WATER RATES APPROVED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Downey City Council voted Tuesday to raise water rates 4% to pay for the 
increased cost of operating the municipal water system. 
</P>
<P>
The water bill for an average residential customer will jump from $23.93 for a 
two-month period to $24.96 beginning Feb. 1, Water Supt. Greg Mayfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a cost-of-living increase," Mayfield said. "It's to maintain 
the current level of services." 
</P>
<P>
The Downey water system serves about 23,000 residences and businesses 
throughout the city. Water rates were last raised in January, 1988.

AGENCY GIVES $33,000 TOWARD CARNAVAL DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After castigating a downtown business group for not running last year's 
Carnaval in a more business-like fashion, the Long Beach Redevelopment Agency 
agreed this week to give the group $33,000 to help pay off its Carnaval debt. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Long Beach Associates (DLBA) has a $66,000 debt left over from the 
Brazilian-style street festival, held for the first time in May. Although the 
event drew about 40,000 people and was deemed a success, DLBA officers say they 
overestimated income from beverage sales, which raised only a portion of the 
$150,000 it cost to stage the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
The agency approved the donation on condition that the business group raise 
money to pay off the rest of the debt by the end of June. More than half of the 
agency's contribution will be taken from the agency's special-events fund, 
thereby reducing the amount left over for other special events this year. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown merchants, saying they want to build the festival into a thriving 
tradition, plan another Carnaval this year.

COUNCIL OKS LAW ON LIQUOR SALE PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In spite of warnings that the legislation will be challenged in court, the 
Glendale City Council adopted an ordinance Tuesday requiring conditional-use 
permits from gas stations that sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
The council vote came after a lengthy public hearing in which lawyers 
representing some of the city's eight gas stations that sell alcohol warned 
city officials that the ordinance would face legal challenges and would not 
decrease drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
An AM-PM Mini Mart representative and three attorneys representing individual 
gas station marts cited numerous surveys and reports, which they said show that 
only a minimal percentage of drunk drivers buy their liquor at gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they claimed repeatedly that the city cannot impose further 
restrictions on gas stations operating with approved liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Frank R. Manzano said that "there is nothing in the law that 
prevents the city from terminating nonconforming uses contrary to zoning 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
"The dispute over the ordinance is clearly going to end up in court," attorney 
Robin Wiener testified. 
</P>
<P>
"It is likely to be defeated, and will cost the council a lot of money that 
could be used in hiring more policemen" to look out for drunk drivers, said the 
attorney, who represents gas station-mini mart owner Charles Mussalli. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was adopted by 4 to 1, with John F. Day dissenting. Council 
member Jerold Milner said that approving the ordinance would send a strong 
message to city's residents about the council's commitment to fight drunk 
driving "because actions speak louder than words."

COMPTON HIGH BASKETBALL COACH GOADS TEAM WITH TOUGH TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compton High School was losing a basketball game, something it had never done 
when Louie Nelson played. Now, 20 years later as the Tarbabes coach, Nelson 
walked into a locker room, bounced his clipboard off the concrete floor and 
screamed: "Everybody's playing scared, you don't want it bad enough." 
</P>
<P>
"You're 6-5, you got one damn rebound," he raged at junior Calvin Curry. "Let 
me tell you why you don't play, Calvin. You don't put out." 
</P>
<P>
That was at half-time of Compton's Moore League opener Friday night at Long 
Beach Wilson High. The day before, in the green-walled classroom where he 
teaches algebra, Nelson had said, "I don't like to lose. I was trained not to 
lose in basketball, I'm not used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Long before losing began to persist at Compton, Nelson starred on the school's 
1967-68 and '68-'69 undefeated state championship teams. In his first year as 
coach, he has revived the Tarbabes, who were 4-16 overall a year ago but are 
11-4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional During Game 
</P>
<P>
"I'm emotional, they're laid back," said Nelson, 36, who was a wreck in the 
65-56 loss to Wilson. His shirttail was out. He rarely sat. He pleaded with the 
referees and berated them for calling a multitude of fouls on his aggressive 
players. He abruptly benched forward Ron Williams, telling him, "Don't you ever 
talk back to me again, you understand me?" 
</P>
<P>
Away from the charged atmosphere of his sport, Nelson's beard frames a smile 
and he gives no hint, while helping students master equations, that he is 
capable of blasting anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I do things without thinking," he said. "My personality fluctuates. 
There's only two ways I can be, real nice or real mean. If we're not winning, 
I'm mean." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's top priority has been to instill discipline in his players. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep adding rules because they're used to doing things on their 
own," he said. "It's different in the inner city. Most of them don't have a 
father image, they don't know what to expect from a black adult male. They're 
not used to taking orders, so they have a tendency to mouth back a little." 
</P>
<P>
One of Nelson's rules is that if a player does not come to school or class on 
the day of a game, he does not play that night. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize the job it is getting them to go to class," he said. "They 
come to school, come to practice, but they won't go to class. I tell them to go 
to class, but I can't walk them to class because I'm teaching." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Team Catching On 
</P>
<P>
Faced with Nelson's tough-guy approach, the Tarbabes have begun to catch on to 
what he is telling them. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us respect him," said point guard Alonzo Lemmons. "He's always thinking 
positively. He only yells for us to do better. I'd rather have him yell at me 
than make a mistake over again." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who lives in Montclair, hopes he will be a positive role model for his 
players but worries about their outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectations are not the same," he said. "When I was coming along, if you 
were a black man, you needed to prove yourself. Now, expectations are low. They 
don't really feel good about themselves. I think most of these kids don't know 
whether they want to be successful. They live day to day and I thought about 
long-range goals. I wanted to be comfortable in life, have a good job, be able 
to afford nice things." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Compton High, Nelson played at the University of 
Washington and then spent the mid-'70s in the National Basketball Assn. as a 
6-foot-3 guard with Washington, New Orleans, Kansas City, San Antonio and New 
Jersey. At New Orleans he was the back-court partner of Pete Maravich and 
averaged 12 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know of me," he said, recalling his introduction to the Compton 
players. "To the kids I'm old. The principal had told them I played, but you 
don't really know until you get on the court, so a couple of times I had to get 
out there and show them I could still do the job." 
</P>
<P>
After his playing career, Nelson decided, because of an affinity for math and a 
desire to have summers off, to become a teacher. He earned a teaching 
credential at Cal State Los Angeles in 1981 and was an assistant basketball 
coach there for five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weak in Fundamentals 
</P>
<P>
When he took the Compton job last June, he discovered a team that had talent 
but was weak in fundamentals and had little knowledge of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was programmed to win, these kids were programmed to accept losing," Nelson 
said. "As long as they played hard and almost won, that was good. They don't 
realize the sacrifices it takes to win. To go home from practice, eat and go to 
bed so they can be at practice at 8 in the morning. They might go home, then 
hang out, or watch videos till 2 in the morning and miss practice. When I 
played we thought it was a cardinal sin to be late." 
</P>
<P>
Compton's leading scorer is senior forward Terrance Adams, who is averaging 17 
points a game. But Adams, who called a timeout late in the Wilson game when 
Nelson did not want one, has not won his coach's respect. 
</P>
<P>
"He's used to doing it his way," Nelson said. "He's really talented, but he 
uses his skills only to score or block a shot. He plays toward a crowd. I don't 
think he'll learn this year." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night was a hard lesson for all the Tarbabes, who had made a comeback in 
the fourth quarter before letting Wilson pull away. They picked up their blue 
gym bags and walked gloomily back to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of you guys don't know how to win," Nelson told them without screaming. 
"Almost don't get it, fellas. We lost 'cause you guys won't play together. 
Practice tomorrow at 9 o'clock, be on time." 
</P>
<P>
The shouts of the Wilson players celebrating in an adjoining locker room could 
be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to the bus, just be quiet," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing else to say.

BRONCO WOMEN TO OPEN BASKETBALL TITLE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona, which has won or shared the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. championship in women's basketball for seven straight years, will open 
defense of its title at UC Riverside at 5:45 p.m. Friday in the conference 
opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which reached the NCAA Division II quarterfinals last season, is 11-4 
and Riverside is 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
While the Broncos would appear to have an advantage over Riverside, Pomona 
Coach Darlene May is looking at the game cautiously. "We have to be ready for 
them," she said. "Riverside is not going to win every game, but they're going 
to beat some people." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will face a Riverside team that is led by its front line featuring 
center Tonie Carter (5-11) and forward Cokey Drake (5-8). Carter is averaging 
18 points and 8.8 rebounds and Drake 13.6 points. Another top player is reserve 
center Patti Held (6-1), who averages 11.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will counter with one of top front-line players in the conference 
in junior center Niki Bracken (6-2), who averages 18.5 points and 9.2 rebounds. 
In addition, Pomona starts senior Susan Luckinbill (5-8) and sophomore 
Stephanie Coons (5-10) at forward. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is also talented at guard with senior Cathy Gooden (5-5), who averages 
14.1 points and 4.9 assists, and sophomore Carrie Egan (5-8), who averages 9.7 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles has fallen a little short of its goal of making the NCAA 
Division II women's basketball playoffs the last two seasons, but Coach Fran 
Buckless thinks he may have a better chance this time heading into the team's 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. opener against visiting Cal State 
Northridge at 5:45 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, who finished third in the conference last season, entered 
the week with an 8-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal State L.A. has won two straight since adding 6-0 forward Trisha Maly, a 
transfer from Pepperdine. In her first two games last week, Maly scored 32 
points and grabbed 10 rebounds despite the fact that she hadn't played in more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year that's a goal for us and I think that's a little more realistic with 
the addition of Trish and the way the other players are playing," Buckless 
said. "We're real pleased to have Trisha." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles have two other outstanding players on their front line in 
center Lupe Quintana (6-0), who averages 14 points and 10 rebounds, and forward 
Tina Slatinsky (6-1), who averages 13 points and 6.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which finished second in the conference last season, enters 
conference play at 11-3. The Matadors are led by senior forward Chris Cavalin 
(5-10), a transfer from Chapman who averages 17 points and 10 rebounds. Two 
other top players are forward Julie Arlotto (5-11) and guard Bridgette Ealy 
(5-8). 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team can improve its winning percentage to 
.500 with a victory in its conference opener Friday, although it will not be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (5-6) face powerful UC Riverside (11-1) at 8:05 at Riverside. Among 
Riverside's wins was a 110-92 decision over Iowa, which had been ranked No. 4 
in the NCAA Division I, in the final of the Chaminade Christmas Classic in 
Hawaii last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders are led by senior guard Maurice Pullum, who averages 18 points, 
and junior forward Chris Ceballos (6-5) at 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's top players include forwards Matt Sample (6-5) and Nate Macon (6-3) 
and guard D. J. Norman (6-1).

NEW CIF CAGE PLAYOFF FORMAT DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he learned that the CIF Southern Section was revamping its 1988-89 playoff 
format for boys and girls basketball teams to move in step with the state's 
system, which is based on enrollment, El Monte High Coach John Gillette 
couldn't believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
For Gillette's team, which has struggled in recent seasons since reaching the 
Southern Section 2-A Division final in 1985, it resulted in a giant leap up 
from the 2-A to the 5-A. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the reasoning behind it -- getting in line with the rest of the state," 
he said. "But I can't believe it. Hey, we have the largest section in the 
state. Why don't they get in line with us?" 
</P>
<P>
But Don Holbrook of Los Altos, whose girls team moved up from 3-A to 4-A, saw 
the change in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was about time," he said. "I think it's the only way you can do the 
playoffs so you're competing against teams your own size. I wish they'd do it 
for the leagues, too." 
</P>
<P>
Added St. Monica Coach Leo Klemm, whose boys team dropped from 5-A to 2-A: "I 
think like any change you're going to affect a lot of people. But for the most 
part people are going to benefit by the change. . . . In the long run, I think 
it's a good change." 
</P>
<P>
Under the change, the top three teams in each league (or two in a five-team 
league) are placed in one of nine playoff divisions based on enrollment. Teams 
with winning percentages of .500 or more can also be considered for a playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section 5-AA and 5-A will compete in Division I at the state 
level; 4-AA and 4-A in Division II; 3-A in Division III; 2-AA and 2-A in 
Division IV and 1-A and Small Schools in Division V. Divisions for all-boys and 
all-girls schools are determined by doubling the school's enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Crowley, associate commissioner of athletics for the Southern Section, 
said the CIF had been discussing the possibility of a format change before it 
was approved by the Southern Section's board of governors last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has gone to the enrollment format for the playoffs and we have teams 
that are smaller in enrollment competing against larger schools in their 
(state) division," Crowley explained. "It doesn't help the big schools because 
the big schools are good at any level. But last year we had no team (from the 
Southern Section) in the state playoffs in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
"We were losing good teams from the tournament. We had no one in Division III 
and very few in Division IV and V (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said that, in the long run, the format change will benefit Southern 
Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, it's going to allow some of the smaller schools to 
get into the state tournament," he said. "We're the largest section in the 
state, with over 500 schools, and we're the only one playing by division. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have a state championship in California, I would say we should go 
back to the old classification system. But under the circumstances, with state 
championships being conducted by enrollment, I think this is the fairest way to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound fair to most coaches, but not everybody is enamored of the new 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can use just one criterion, such as enrollment, as a playoff 
basis," said Alhambra's Jim Wetmore, whose boys team steps up from 3-A to 5-AA. 
"We have a lot of Asians here and we have only one player over 5-11 on our 
squad. . . . I don't think we're really a 5-AA school, but we have no choice in 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people who made this (change) walked around our campus, I think they'd 
be amazed. We're a school of 3,300, but you should see our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gillette: "What the CIF didn't take into account is we're 5-A in 
enrollment but where do we draw our talent from? . . . I thought the idea of 
divisions was meant to be equitable by talent. Now it's done in a way that 
looks fair but it really isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had this format in place a few years ago, we would have never made it to 
the (Southern Section) finals. . . . You start pairing us with teams like 
Capistrano Valley, Ocean View and Lakewood -- give us a break. I think you've 
effectively eliminated a 2-A type of school from winning the title." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said the format will almost certainly create numerous mismatches in 
the early rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Say we finish third in our league and now we have to move up to play Mater Dei 
in the first round," he said. "Holy cow! You're going to see some real blowouts 
in the playoffs. At least on paper it would appear there's a chance for a lot 
of blowouts throughout the championships." 
</P>
<P>
Wetmore doesn't think his team has much of a chance if it makes the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it," he said. "If we go up against a team that goes say 
6-7, 6-7 and 6-6 across, how are we going to go up against them. We played 
Pasadena in a non-league game and they beat us by 30 points, and they're a 
division below us (5-A)." 
</P>
<P>
The new system gives coaches the opportunity to move up to a higher enrollment 
division, but not a lower one for the playoffs. By last week's filing deadline, 
15 boys teams and five girls teams had decided to move to a higher division for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial power St. Bernard was one of the schools that decided for a higher 
division, moving from 3-A to 5-AA. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Bernard has only 600 boys, so we should match up against teams of about 
the same size," Coach Jim McClune said. "All things being equal, that's how it 
should be, but all things aren't equal. We just happen to have a good 
basketball team. We've made the CIF 5-A semifinals about four times in the last 
eight years, so we've been pretty successful at that level. So we're 
comfortable with that for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Klemm's St. Monica team also opted to move up to 5-AA for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to play at the 5-AA level even though we are a small school 
because we feel we are competitive at that level," he said. "We were already 
playing at the 5-AA level (5-A last year). For another team it might have been 
another thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said that for his team, under the new format, it wouldn't make much 
difference what division he chose. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking maybe it would be more beneficial to move up to the 5-AA 
because it looked (at first) like there were a few less good teams there," he 
said. "But what difference is it going to make? At any level, I can't see us or 
any schools like us going very far under this format." 
</P>
<P>
Wetmore said he thinks schools should have the option of moving down for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If a team can move up, a team should be able to move down, too," he said. "It 
should be a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches also think that allowing schools with .500 records or better to 
make the playoffs as at-large teams will encourage schools in tougher leagues 
to play easier non-league schedules. 
</P>
<P>
But Klemm doesn't think that would be beneficial. "Our philosophy is always to 
schedule the best opponents," he said. "When you don't do that, you're going 
against yourself. A person can schedule that way, but I think you suffer for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said the new format will stay in effect for at least the next two 
seasons, although he said that it is not permanent by any means. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about staying this way, but this is not etched in stone," Crowley 
said. "We will go with playoffs by enrollment this year and next year. We will 
poll the schools in January or February of next year about whether they want to 
stay in this format. If a large majority says stay with it we'll keep it, and 
if not we can try another option. 
</P>
<P>
"Playoff groupings are on a two-year cycle, so this is the way it will be the 
next two years." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, for one, is hoping that the new format doesn't last any longer than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way it's going to be this particular year, but I would have to 
imagine that if there's enough noise something could be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, like it or not, it is something that he will have to live 
with.

MORE ONE-BEDROOM UNITS SOUGHT;

<P>
QUALITY OF LIFE A CONCERN IN APARTMENT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
When city planners wrote the new zoning ordinance that the Glendale Planning 
Commission considered this week, they had two goals in mind -- reducing the 
density of new apartments and making them more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance would force developers to build shorter apartment and 
condominium buildings that sit farther back from the street and would blend in 
better with Glendale neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings would be smaller and have more one-bedroom apartments and more 
parking spaces. And developers of structures with more than 24 units would have 
to install swimming pools, laundry facilities and landscaping or pay special 
fees to the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Giant Cubes' 
</P>
<P>
The revamped zoning ordinance is meant to curtail the construction of large 
apartment buildings with four- or five-bedroom units that Councilwoman Ginger 
Bremberg likened to "giant cubes" because of their boxiness. 
</P>
<P>
Often, these buildings take up as much space as possible, consuming most of the 
grounds that otherwise could be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the trend," developer Berdj Karapetian said. "More developers are 
building and more people are buying large apartments." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the new ordinance will attempt to reverse that trend by reducing 
the bulk and scale of future projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff proposal would encourage the development of more modest-size 
dwelling units, including one-bedroom apartments, which are currently not being 
proposed by the development community," Planning Director John McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
City planners are also seeking ways to cushion the impact of Glendale's 
continued population growth. One of the ways is to require more space between 
buildings. Another is to require deeper building setbacks from the streets. The 
proposed ordinance would do both. 
</P>
<P>
The number of parking spaces required would increase to a minimum of two per 
unit. Developers would no longer be permitted to fulfill parking requirements 
with compact car-sized spaces substituting for full-sized spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the new ordinance would treat each level of a partially underground 
parking garage as a full story, a change aimed at lowering the overall height 
of new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Building Costs 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the ordinance would add a number of features that could upgrade the 
occupants' quality of life and would certainly make it more costly to build 
apartments in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
All new buildings with more than three units would have to be equipped with 
spas, for example. Structures with more than 24 units would have to include 
swimming pools. If builders do not wish to build the pools, they may pay fees 
to the city instead. 
</P>
<P>
Elevators would be required for apartments three stories or taller. Landscaped 
outdoor space would be required, as would laundry facilities.

CHLORINE LEAK FORCED SIMI VALLEY EVACUATION; 
</P>
<P>
DEFECTIVE ALARM ON GAS TANK SUSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN and CARLOS LOZANO, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County fire officials said they are investigating whether an alarm at a 
Simi Valley textile plant was working when a cloud of poisonous gas leaked from 
a 30-ton chlorine tank last Thursday, forcing the evacuation of more than 
12,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials believe that the alarm may have been defective because they 
first learned of the leak at the plant, Travelin' West Textiles, from a nearby 
business owner who called to complain of chlorine odors, Battalion Chief Dan 
Spykerman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that emission of the cloud of chlorine gas from Travelin' 
West on Easy Street could have been prevented had firefighters learned of the 
leak sooner, Spykerman said. But authorities should not have to depend on 
citizens' complaints to learn of emergencies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, businesses that use chlorine and other hazardous materials 
must install leak-detection systems equipped with alarms and maintain them in 
good condition, Spykerman said. Violating the law is a misdemeanor offense 
punishable by a maximum fine of $2,000 and up to two years in County Jail, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bleaching Waste Water 
</P>
<P>
Travelin' West, which uses chlorine to bleach waste water infused with dye 
before discharging the water into the sewer, had an alarm attached to the 
bottom of its outdoor chlorine tank, he said. However, it is unclear if the 
alarm was activated last Thursday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Melody Knitting Mills, which owns the Travelin' West plant, could 
not be reached for comment. Joe Lange, an attorney for the Travelin' West 
plant, said Wednesday that "nobody in the company received any calls from the 
alarm company." 
</P>
<P>
If the device at the Travelin' West plant had been working, it would have 
sounded at the dispatch center of a private alarm company, but not at any of 
the county's fire stations, Spykerman said. Such alarms are not hooked up to 
fire stations because firefighters often are out on calls and might not hear 
them go off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the device did go off, the alarm company would have called Richard Bates, 
owner of the textile plant, or other company officials, Spykerman said. State 
law does not require business owners to notify authorities in the event of 
toxic leaks, although it does mandate that they report fires, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The law only implies that they must report toxic problems, but it's not 
specifically spelled out like it should be," he said. "I think this will 
eventually go the way of sprinklers in high-rises: It'll take a disaster to 
strengthen the law, which is a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Spykerman said officials are reviewing tapes of calls made to the Fire 
Department last Thursday morning to see whether Bates, or anyone else connected 
with the textile company, reported the leak. However, it appears that during 
the hour that followed the 6:30 a.m. call from the nearby business owner, no 
one telephoned authorities about the leak, Spykerman said. He declined to 
identify the business owner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the alarm failed to work until later in the morning, when 
the gas built up, and that Mr. Bates called us when he was notified of the 
leak," he said. "But the detection device should have worked from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning was not the first time that the Fire Department received calls 
about chlorine odors from the textile plant, Spykerman said. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, firefighters would arrive at the plant once or twice a 
month, only to find that the odors were coming from the tank where the dyed 
water and chlorine were mixed -- not from the chlorine tank itself, Spykerman 
said. The odors were annoying, but not strong enough to be hazardous or to 
violate pollution laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Offender 
</P>
<P>
Chlorine, one of the most commonly produced chemicals in the United States, is 
also one of the hazardous materials most commonly involved in industrial 
accidents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Between July, 1986, and December, 1987, chlorine was named in 43 
hazardous-material incidents throughout California, according to a report by 
the state Office of Emergency Services. Of the 200 chemicals listed in the 
report, chlorine ranked 11th among those most often involved in industrial 
accidents, said Fred Lecari, a spokesman for the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
When inhaled, chlorine gas can cause choking and coughing. If breathed in 
sufficient quantities, chlorine can cause pulmonary edema, or the buildup of 
fluid in the lungs, which can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, 20 people, including five Ventura County firefighters and a 
sheriff's deputy, were injured after inhaling the toxic gas. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a cloud containing a chlorine compound escaped from a southeast 
Los Angeles manufacturer of chlorine tablets for swimming pools, forcing the 
evacuation of about 28,000 residents from the cities of Commerce, Montebello, 
Monterey Park and unincorporated areas of East Los Angeles.

WINTER NOTEBOOK /SEAN WATERSEND OF WIN STREAK CAUSES LOSS OF SLEEP FOR BUENA'S 
HANNAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena High boys' basketball Coach Glen Hannah stayed up to watch the sun rise 
Tuesday morning because he didn't want to experience another nightmare, 
especially after the Bulldogs' performance against Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans ended the Bulldogs' Channel League winning streak at 24 games with 
a 78-53 victory. 
</P>
<P>
What gave Hannah insomnia wasn't the final score but the manner in which the 
Bulldogs lost. Buena committed 22 turnovers and made only 12 of 29 free throws. 
The Bulldogs also were outrebounded, 39-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't give ourselves a chance to win," Hannah said. "We must have missed 
seven front ends of one-and-one free throws. They pressed us in the second half 
and we came out real panicky. We were trying to get rid of the ball in a hurry 
instead of paying attention to where the ball was going." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah said that he stayed awake after the game designing drills to teach his 
players how to handle a press, but he won't lose any sleep trying to figure out 
his team's season-long problem at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," Hannah said. "Maybe we can make a rule where the 
referees can't call any fouls against the other team. If that doesn't work, 
maybe we can have the option of taking the ball out instead of shooting free 
throws." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah said he was upset that the streak ended, but added it didn't bother his 
players too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get the players behind the streak because it started two seasons 
ago," Hannah said. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict: The Southern Section Executive Committee will meet Saturday to 
discuss possible sanctions against Santa Clara for forfeiting a pair of games 2 
weeks ago in the Estancia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara failed to show up for its 2 consolation games after its initial 
loss of the season, to Huntington Beach Edison, in the second round. Coach Lou 
Cvijanovich said that the officiating was biased toward Orange County teams and 
pulled the Saints from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The most severe penalty Santa Clara could receive would be suspension from the 
Southern Section for breaking its contract. 
</P>
<P>
According to Southern Section rule 151.3: "When a school fails to engage in a 
contest agreed upon, without giving notice to the other school and securing an 
honorable release, it may be suspended from membership." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member executive committee consists of superintendents, principals and 
athletic directors from throughout the Southern Section. Santa Clara sent a 
tape of the game and an extended narrative from Cvijanovich to defend its case. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich refuses to comment about the case until the Southern Section office 
makes a ruling. Southern Section official Dean Crowley does not believe that 
Santa Clara will have its membership suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with Lou and I believe he deeply regrets it and is sorry about making 
the decision to pull out of the tournament," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley added that the Orange County Officials Assn. apparently did not assign 
the referees for the tournament. "One official from the association did the 
assigning for the tournament, and we need to ascertain whether those officials 
were qualified for varsity games," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting over: The Ventura girls' basketball team had to forfeit 6 wins after 
senior starting guard Nichole Force was found by the school to be athletically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Force, who transferred last year from Oxnard, was in her fifth year in school. 
According to Southern Section rules, an athlete is eligible to compete for 8 
consecutive semesters. 
</P>
<P>
Force was the team's second-leading scorer with a 13.6 average. She had missed 
the past 2 games and will remain ineligible unless Ventura succeeds in its 
attempt to have her reinstated by the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Four-corners mistake: Hueneme Coach Howard Davis made a 6-point mistake by 
calling for a four corners offense during the Vikings' league opener against 
Dos Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was trying to get his players to hold the ball with a 52-49 lead and 3 
minutes left. The Vikings had scored 15 unanswered points to overcome a 
12-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But when Davis yelled "stall," he received a technical foul sign from the 
referees. 
</P>
<P>
"They called a technical foul because I got out of my chair to talk to my 
players," Davis said. "But that's an old rule that was changed this year. I was 
enraged and they gave me another technical. The timing was ridiculous. I get up 
a lot during a game. Why didn't they give me the foul earlier in the game when 
I first got out of my chair?" 
</P>
<P>
Billy Barry of Dos Pueblos made all 4 free throws and a short jump shot to give 
Dos Pueblos a 55-52 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The referees admitted they had made a mistake and apologized afterward, but 
Davis remained irate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my seventh year of coaching and that was my worst night," Davis said. 
"If ever there was a night to call it quits and leave coaching, it was that 
night."

SEASON OPENS SATURDAY FOR VENTURA YACHT CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Stanton will not be launching his 40-foot racing yacht into the chilly 
waters of the Santa Barbara Channel this weekend for the Ventura Yacht Club's 
season-opening regatta. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton, 52, of Ventura, a veteran of hundreds of yacht and sailboat races, no 
longer feels compelled to compete on the opening day of the racing season. He's 
content now to wait until the conditions are more hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll wait until the weather gets warmer before I go out and race," Stanton 
said. "If you do this year after year, in order to keep your sanity and your 
family together, you can't compete in the entire racing schedule." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's regatta launches the Ventura Yacht Club's annual spring series 
of races. Six area yacht clubs will compete in the series, which begins 
Saturday and continues Feb. 11 and March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Racers will compete on marked, triangular courses off Ventura Harbor, racing 
distances ranging from 3 to 15 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The racing season runs from Jan. 14 through Nov. 11, with the Ventura Cup, the 
premier regatta of the season, slated for Sept. 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for such a long season is that the strong prevailing winds 
that whip through the Santa Barbara Channel, which extends 100 miles from north 
of Santa Barbara to Point Dume, provide ideal racing conditions, according to 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Ventura Yacht Club, which recently celebrated its 50th 
anniversary, 5 other clubs will compete in this weekend's race -- the Anacapa 
Yacht Club; Channel Islands Yacht Club; Pacific Corinthian Yacht Club; Pierpont 
Bay Yacht Club; and the Santa Barbara Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Three classes of yachts will compete -- the spinnaker, yachts with the big 
balloon sail at the front of the sailboat; the nonspinnaker; and the Catalina 
38 class for sailboats up to 38 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Three races are slated for Saturday, beginning at 11 a.m. All races start at 
the Ventura Harbor.

WATKINS, AIDS PANEL HEAD, TO FILL ENERGY POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Bush, filling the final slot in his Cabinet, plans today to 
name as his secretary of energy retired Adm. James D. Watkins, former chief of 
naval operations and chairman of the highly regarded presidential commission on 
AIDS, sources close to Bush said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, 61, fits one of the prime criteria that Bush has laid out for the 
energy post -- knowledge of the nation's nuclear industry and the problems of 
the country's troubled nuclear weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
A protege of the late Adm. Hyman Rickover, Watkins served as a nuclear 
submarine commander and as manager of naval reactors for the Atomic Energy 
Commission before becoming commander of the U.S. Pacific fleet and the Navy's 
chief of operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Difficult to Fill 
</P>
<P>
The energy job, which President Reagan once pledged to abolish and then treated 
as a low-profile assignment, has proved to be among the most difficult for Bush 
to fill. The difficulty has stemmed from conflicting political pressures 
surrounding the job as well as from the controversial issues the new secretary 
will face, particularly the massive job of cleaning up the country's troubled 
nuclear weapons plants. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, a Texan with a political base in the oil states of the Southwest, had 
come under intense pressure to pick an energy secretary with ties to the 
petroleum industry. Numerous oil and gas industry executives had been backing 
former Louisiana Rep. W. Henson Moore for the post. 
</P>
<P>
With other Bush advisers arguing that picking an energy secretary with oil 
industry connections would be a political misstep, transition aides in recent 
weeks floated a series of names of potential nominees for the energy post. 
Each, in turn, was shot down by fierce opposition, much of it from Bush's Texas 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, however, does not appear likely to draw that sort of fire. Unlike 
several of the other people who had been considered, he has no ties to the 
unpopular energy policies of the Jimmy Carter Administration. And the reviews 
of his performance in his military posts have been almost uniformly glowing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of a guy whose name I keep in my little black book when a job 
needs to be done," Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department has responsibility for producing nuclear material for the 
nation's stock of strategic warheads and atomic bombs, and the plants that make 
that material have deteriorated in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The plants, built mostly in the 1950s, are now largely shut down because of 
disrepair and mounting environmental problems. Congressional leaders have 
estimated that rehabilitating and cleaning them up could cost more than $100 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waste Piling Up 
</P>
<P>
The department also must find repositories for the radioactive waste generated 
by the nation's civilian nuclear industry. The waste -- highly radioactive 
spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors as well as low-level radioactive waste 
from medical laboratories and other sources -- has been piling up in temporary 
storage around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan picked Watkins to head the AIDS panel in October, 1987, after 
the admiral had served as a member of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins' appointment as chairman was viewed as a way to create a more 
cooperative atmosphere, since the panel had become ensnarled in political 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's final report, released in the summer of 1988, called for passage of 
a federal law prohibiting discrimination against people infected by the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in filling his top posts, still must choose a nominee to take charge of 
the new Administration's war on drugs. The job, while not at the Cabinet level, 
will have equivalent status. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John H. Sununu, Bush's White House chief of staff, has finished 
filling the senior White House staff positions. Among those named: Roger B. 
Porter, assistant to the President for economic and domestic policy; Stephen M. 
Studdert, assistant to the President for special activities and initiatives, 
and Richard Breeden, assistant to the President for issues analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Porter is a professor of business and government at Harvard University, and a 
former director of Reagan's White House office of policy development. Studdert 
is executive director of the inauguration and was a senior White House official 
during Reagan's first term. Breeden is a Washington lawyer who has served as a 
deputy counsel to Bush.

CUBAN RIGHTS CRACKDOWN, PSYCHIATRIC ABUSES TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON A. SCHANCHE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HAVANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cuban government has launched a new crackdown against human rights 
activists and for the first time stands accused of using electric shock 
treatments and psychoactive drugs against forcibly hospitalized political 
prisoners, according to leaders of the country's two major human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of grudging official tolerance of the groups, beatings, 
arrests and surveillance of human rights workers have accelerated since 
mid-September, said Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission for Human 
Rights and National Reconciliation, and Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, vice president 
of the Cuban Human Rights Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sanchez and Arcos charged in separate interviews, widespread 
rights abuses, including at least one unprovoked police killing of a minor 
offender, have again increased under the regime of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the groups, which are technically illegal, called the crackdown 
"renewed repression" and said that, ironically, the beginning of the trend 
coincided with a 10-day investigation last September by a delegation from the 
U.N. Human Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commission's visit had aroused hope among many observers for a further 
easing of government pressure against dissidents. A formal report of the 
inquiry has not yet been written, but members of the U.N. group had been quoted 
as reporting that they found fewer rights abuses in Cuba than they had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
The charges of psychiatric abuse against political prisoners, once common in 
the Soviet Union but never before reported in Cuba, came from both human rights 
groups, acting independently. Each said it had forwarded its information to the 
U.N. commission and to independent rights groups such as Americas Watch and 
Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
Arcos said the best-documented case is that of Jesus Leyva Guerra, an activist 
member of his human rights committee, who has been held since July 14 at a 
psychiatric hospital in Santiago de Cuba, on the island's southeast coast. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Leyva, about 40, was given a series of six shock treatments 
shortly after being detained and hospitalized and another series of six in 
December. Afterward, Leyva reportedly was so disoriented that he did not even 
recognize his wife. The last treatment was so excessive, according to Sanchez, 
that it left Leyva with electrode burns on his temples. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't sick," Arcos declared. "They used these medical things to destroy his 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez noted that when human rights groups and Leyva's wife protested, the 
authorities responded that Leyva was "crazy" and that they were trying to cure 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"We think when he leaves the hospital he will be worse," Sanchez said. Both 
Arcos and Sanchez displayed documents from Leyva's wife to support their 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
A Cuban government official, asked to comment on the charges, responded by 
shrugging his shoulders and rolling his eyes, then warned that it was dangerous 
for foreign journalists to interview the human rights dissidents without first 
advising the government. The groups are under constant surveillance and any 
contact they make with foreign correspondents is quickly reported, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A second case cited by Sanchez was undocumented, but he repeatedly stressed 
that it was authentic, based on interviews by monitors from his human rights 
group with another man who underwent the same treatment. He said the man, named 
Quesada, was released several months ago after being confined in one of two 
police-controlled pavilions at Havana's main psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, he was completely sane," Sanchez said. "Now he is not the same man. In 
the psychiatric hospital he received massive electric shocks and psychoactive 
drugs." Psychoactive drugs, which are drugs designed to have a specific effect 
on the brain, could be used to tranquilize or otherwise alter prisoners' 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said Quesada had been too affected by the treatment to talk with a 
foreign journalist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Control' 
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital's two pavilions are under the strict control of the 
Interior Ministry, adding: "Usually the political police hospitalize dissidents 
in those pavilions. What occurs there is out of all democratic or humanitarian 
control." 
</P>
<P>
With Sanchez during a recent interview was 24-year-old Jose Luis Alvarado, who 
charged that he had been given shock treatment and heavy doses of psychoactive 
drugs in 1980 and 1982 at one of the pavilions while under sentence for 
attempting to leave Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I was given two sessions (of electric shock), and the second 
only one," Alvarado said. "I also had to take psychopharmic drugs three times 
daily, and so did the others. There were about 100 prisoners in the pavilion. 
They used the psychiatric hospital to destroy the will of the person." 
</P>
<P>
The two human rights officials described dozens of recent arrests, beatings and 
public clashes with police to underscore their belief that a new campaign 
against them is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to silence the human rights groups eased in 1987 after Castro bowed to 
pressure from international human rights groups and a U.N. campaign led by the 
United States. He released hundreds of political prisoners and permitted 
leaders of the fledgling organizations to meet with visiting human rights 
workers, diplomats and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is more repression than in 1987 when the level -- in terms of 
brutal violations of human rights -- began to decline," Sanchez said. "Together 
with that decline came the flowering of the human rights groups, which 
continued until the arrival of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in September. 
During the visit, and above all after they left the country, there has been an 
increase in repression." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and Arcos cited week-by-week chronologies of reported human rights 
violations during and since the U.N. commission's visit. More than 20 persons 
were arrested during the visit for attempting to talk with U.N. investigators, 
they said, and at least 10 of the 80 to 100 people who were actually 
interviewed by the U.N. team were later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the rights leaders charged: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six artists and writers from a group favoring artistic freedom were beaten 
and arrested when they attempted to place flowers at a downtown Havana monument 
to Jose Marti, the 19th-Century revolutionary poet revered as the father of 
Cuban independence. Five more members of the group, called Pro-Arte Liberal, 
were later taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two leaders of a political offshoot of Arcos' group, the Cuban Human Rights 
Party, also were jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dozens of youths calling for greater freedom and more leisure activities 
for young people were attacked by plainclothes policemen when they marched 
through downtown Havana last Oct. 23. "It was almost a street battle," Arcos 
said, adding that all but one of 36 youths arrested that day were teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In ensuing months, dozens more have been taken into custody and charged 
with civil offenses such as disorderly conduct for marching in demonstrations 
in at least three provinces outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cuba had charged such suspects with political crimes against the state 
until about two years ago, all the recent detainees have been sentenced or 
fined for civil offenses, Arcos and Sanchez said. This permits the government 
to deny that anyone is being held for political crimes, they charged. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a long list of other rights abuses, Arcos accused a Havana policeman 
of murder in the shooting death of a 25-year-old street salesman named Pedro 
Ortega Concha, who was peddling homemade plastic bottle caps, an illegal 
capitalist enterprise in Communist Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"The policeman asked him to hand over the bottle caps and, when he refused, 
shot him in the liver," Arcos said. "He died in a few minutes. The policeman is 
still working." 
</P>
<P>
Another youth was shot when a group of policemen stormed a Havana bus station 
looking for the person who scrawled "Down With Castro" on a wall, Arcos said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of such responses by police, there are few such public 
manifestations of anti-Castro feeling here. But a number of young people in the 
capital have been laughing lately over apparently spontaneous outbursts of a 
popular song when Castro has appeared on the screen at local movie houses. The 
song: "That Man Is Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent rights crackdown, Cuba is meeting pledges made over the 
past year to release hundreds of political prisoners, according to American 
officials who monitor the situation here. They said that of the 450 prisoners 
Castro promised he would release, 250 are now free, most of them living as 
refugees in the United States. The promise was made last May to New York's 
Cardinal John J. O'Connor during the Roman Catholic prelate's visit to Cuba.

U.S. VIEWS LIBYA CRISIS AS FADING; 
</P>
<P>
149 COUNTRIES DECIDE TO BAN CHEMICAL ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 149-nation conference on chemical weapons unanimously agreed here Wednesday 
to outlaw the use of lethal gases by "completely eliminating them." 
</P>
<P>
All the countries promised "not to use chemical weapons" and to "condemn such 
use." 
</P>
<P>
The Paris conference also urged concluding "at an early date" a binding 
convention in Geneva on "the prohibition of the development, production, 
stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons, and on their destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Such a chemical weapons ban, said the final resolution of the conference, 
should be "global" and of "unlimited duration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arab Threat Averted 
</P>
<P>
A threat by Arab nations not to sign the final document unless it made 
reference to banning nuclear weapons in the Middle East was averted during the 
overnight drafting of the final text. Conference sources said that Arab League 
members do not want to be blamed for not agreeing to abolish chemical weapons 
-- particularly since one of their number, Iraq, is widely believed to have 
used poison gas in its war with Iran and against Kurdish rebels within its own 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a final paragraph spoke of the need for "complete disarmament under 
effective international control," which Arab nations took to include nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Among the signers of the final resolution were the United States and the Soviet 
Union, the only nations that admit to producing and possessing poison gases, 
and another 20 countries with the capability to manufacture the lethal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, suggested by President Reagan in September, was prompted in 
part by the charges that Iraq had used poison gas and was designed to speed up 
long-standing negotiations in Geneva on a complete ban of chemical weapons by 
focusing world attention on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.S. delegation, William F. Burns, head of the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency, declared Wednesday that the conference had "forged a 
powerful global consensus" and given "a significant political impetus to the 
Geneva conference on disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Affairs Minister Roland Dumas, president of the conference, said 
the five-day meeting provided a "decisive step" toward a chemical weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
However, the final declaration sidestepped such tough issues as naming 
violators of a 1925 Geneva convention against the use of chemical weapons or 
warning Libya against completing the plant that the United States says is for 
manufacturing lethal chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The document also skirted the issue of demanding firmer export controls on 
chemical shipments that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The conference only noted its "serious concern" over recent violations. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which carries no enforcement powers, also avoided the subject 
of sanctions against violators, leaving that issue to the U.N. secretary 
general. 
</P>
<P>
However, most participants seemed to get what they wanted out of the 
conference. The United States was able to focus attention on the chemical 
warfare talks in Geneva. The Soviet Union gained maximum publicity for its 
announcement, made here, that it will start reducing its stockpile of chemical 
weapons. The Iranians got an international forum for their complaints about 
Iraq. And the Arab nations received a similar spotlight for their charges that 
they are threatened by Israel's alleged nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
But at a deeper level, analysts here said the conference showed just how 
difficult it will be to get a universal, verifiable chemical warfare ban in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the United States failed to line up much support for its charges that 
Libya is about to produce chemical weapons that will endanger the world 
community. Instead, it received some unexpected criticism from nonaligned 
countries such as India for insisting that Libya abort plans to produce 
chemical weapons while itself continuing to produce binary gases -- chemical 
agents that are harmless in isolation but deadly when combined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third World View 
</P>
<P>
Indian delegate Muchkund Dubey, reflecting a common Third World view, declared 
of the U.S. position Wednesday: "We can't accept the principle that chemical 
weapons are safe in some hands but not in others. It is too much for a nation 
to say they are the only responsible power in the world, and the others are 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Washington also was unable to win stronger language invoking sanctions for the 
final declaration. 
</P>
<P>
As Burns put it: "It was a consensus document." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz said many 
Arab nations were "not satisfied with the final resolution" because it "didn't 
speak of the one country which has nuclear weapons in the Middle East 
(Israel)." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether other governments had sent experts to Iraq to learn the 
technology of producing chemical weapons, he answered: "Whatever experience we 
have, we will not spread it to other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Another topic avoided by the final resolution was the issue of chemical export 
controls. Even West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher failed to 
mention the subject in his speech, although the United States charged recently 
that West German firms have supplied materials for the controversial Libyan 
plant, and Genscher's government said Tuesday that it will put curbs on 
chemical exports. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was it emphasized just how arduous it will be for Geneva negotiators to 
devise a treaty that will really rid the world of chemical weapons, given the 
ease with which they can now be produced, even by Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the feeling here," said one chemical weapons specialist, "that the 
phosgene is out of the canister. Chemical weapons are a military ace in the 
hole for the poorer countries. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't know just how much the Geneva negotiators, with the best of 
intentions, can do about it."

MODERN PHONE; 
</P>
<P>
DIAL F FOR THE FUTURE -- IT'S HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When telecommunications executive Lee Cox begins the daily commute to his 
office in San Francisco, he presses a button on his car phone to hear a summary 
of traffic conditions. By punching another button on the phone, he can retrieve 
a stream of voice-mail messages recorded overnight by colleagues stationed 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
With other buttons, Cox can tap into stock market reports, pick up scores of 
ball games or get a rundown on the weather outlook for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, president of PacTel Corp., clearly has far more at his fingertips than all 
but a handful of telephone customers. But that won't be true for long. The once 
basic-black telephone is about to become supercharged with new computerized 
features and capabilities that are expected to come into widespread use in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wider Possibilities 
</P>
<P>
And Cox is barely scratching the surface of what can be done with the telephone 
today -- not to mention what will commonly be done tomorrow. Although rarely 
used as such, the dozen push-buttons on the common phone can actually function 
as keys on a computer terminal. By pressing a button or combination of buttons, 
a caller can choose among a broadening array of information services, enter a 
pledge in a fund drive, reply to a recorded opinion poll, or select and charge 
merchandise from catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
As phone companies finish converting their switches to carry information in 
digital form, the old twin strands of twisted copper wires linking homes, 
offices and factories will be transformed into high-speed conduits that carry 
voice, computer data and video transmissions -- all at the same time and over a 
single phone line. 
</P>
<P>
And the key to unlocking that wealth of information is the common and 
ubiquitous telephone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expanding Market 
</P>
<P>
The types of services Cox receives through his car phone already are widely 
available to people who subscribe to databases and have computers linked to 
phone lines with communications devices called modems. But the phone system of 
the 1990s promises to dramatically open the market for these and other services 
by making them easier and cheaper to use. No longer will the user have to buy 
or learn how to use comparatively costly computer equipment; anyone with a 
push-button phone will be able to tap in. 
</P>
<P>
Once the power of the computer becomes readily accessible through a phone's 
key-pad, it produces a sort of "superphone" that may change life styles and 
work patterns before the start of the 21st Century, said Richard Adler, a 
futurist specializing in such "teleservices" for the Institute of the Future in 
Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"You will more and more have the option to do at home what you had to do at the 
office before," Adler said. "People will choose to do at home what is 
convenient, and when they leave home it will be a matter of choice -- for 
socializing, business, recreation or diversion." 
</P>
<P>
Larry L. (Butch) Brown of Natchez, Miss., is part of a tiny minority of 
telephone customers getting a taste of the future today, and he is clearly 
enthusiastic about his phone's new powers. "It's an incredible instrument," 
Brown said. "I couldn't live without it." 
</P>
<P>
The local phone service available to Natchez's 22,000 residents through South 
Central Bell offers features few consumers are familiar with. For one thing, 
the Brown household's busy phone now can vary its ring to let each of the four 
family members know for whom the bell sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are three short, quick rings we know it's for our son," Brown 
explained. "If there are two short, quick rings it's for our daughter. If it's 
the regular ring we know it's for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Browns' phone also can intercept unwanted calls, answering these with a 
message explaining that the call will not be accepted. If the Browns can't get 
to the phone before it stops ringing, no problem: Push a button and the phone 
will call back whatever number was last on the line. And if the family becomes 
bothered by crank or obscene calls, it can signal South Central Bell's computer 
to record the time of day and phone numbers of the parties on the line. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technological Wizardry 
</P>
<P>
"If I only want to get one call, I can program that into the phone, which will 
reject all other calls but put that one through, or forward it to wherever I'm 
headed," Brown said. "And if I dial a line that's busy, I can program the phone 
so it keeps calling every 10 seconds or so until it gets through. Then it calls 
me!" 
</P>
<P>
Each of these features adds $4 to $5 a month to the family's phone bill, but 
Brown said he considers the enhancements worth the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
In communities here and there across the nation that are served by a similar 
computerized switching system, such services are now on the market. Over the 
next three to five years, these features will become widely available as 
switches everywhere are upgraded. Pacific Bell, for example, plans to begin 
offering them next year, first in the San Francisco Bay Area. And GTE 
California is conducting tests in Lancaster, Carpenteria and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1990s, the technology should spread worldwide and be far beyond 
the testing phase. Plans are in the works for a seamless, global network 
capable of carrying conversations, computer data and video signals 
simultaneously over the phone lines already running into homes and businesses. 
Consequently, callers will not get a busy signal, as now, when the phone line 
is carrying computer data. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, British Telecom and France 
Telecom inaugurated a new transatlantic, fiber-optic cable that extends that 
capability across the ocean; another consortium expects to offer transpacific 
service next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The key to supercharging the telephone lies in completing a network 
"intelligent" enough to understand computer and video "talk" without requiring 
customers to hook on special devices such as the modems now needed to send data 
over telephone lines, said Richard Brennan, a senior consultant for AT&amp;T 
Technologies in San Ramon, Calif. Brennan calls this intelligent network "the 
major revolution in the telephone since Alexander Graham Bell invented it." 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of this transformation is that it requires changing the big central 
switching devices but nothing between there and the customer, Brennan said. And 
once these potent switches are interconnected, what emerges is an "integrated 
services digital network," or ISDN. This is a network built to a common set of 
electronic standards, or protocols, that convert communications signals from 
devices of all kinds to a single format that then can be transmitted at the 
speed of light rather than of sound. 
</P>
<P>
The ISDN technology splits each existing phone line into three communications 
channels. That makes it possible, for example, for one member of a household to 
send computer data while another uses a phone on the same line to call a 
friend; the same line also can be used for such chores as monitoring a 
household security system, turning on lights or an air conditioner, or letting 
a utility company read water, gas and electric meters from its office. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, said Sudhir (Sid) Ahuja, who heads a research unit at AT&amp;T's 
Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., true electronic meetings become possible. 
"You and I can literally have a meeting as if we were sitting across from one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
In an electronic meeting, participants don't gather around a table but before 
phones and video screens in any locations linked by ISDN technology. The 
screens can display small images of each participant as well as documents and 
charts to be worked on during the meeting, with movable, color-coded "pointers" 
-- one keyed to each participant -- so that all hands know who is proposing 
what changes. 
</P>
<P>
"You can share information, and you can shift from one 'meeting' to another by 
putting someone on 'hold,' or bring in a third party," Ahuja said. GTE 
California operates a similar network linking 60 computer terminals and 
telephones in its offices in Ontario and Norwalk with company headquarters in 
Thousand Oaks. "We use it on a day-to-day basis," said Lennard D. Glogauer, 
general manager of business applications. 
</P>
<P>
Is this all too complicated for most people? Adler, the futurist, acknowledged 
that there are human limits. For one thing, he said, electronic meetings work 
best with teams and groups accustomed to sharing and coordinating activities 
and information. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it doesn't work so well," he said, "is in sensitive negotiations -- 
where, as someone put it, you want to go in and pound on somebody's table." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the technology on social behavior can be overstated, Adler 
warned. He recalled the unfulfilled predictions of a few years ago that 
computers would create "paperless" offices. For example, he said, electronic 
meetings might seem likely to reduce the need for business travel but in fact 
seems to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies over more than a decade show that the more people communicate the more 
reason they have to get together," he explained. "What it does do is let people 
work together more intensively on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, changes in the way people live may be no greater than those triggered 
by such previous major technological advances as the automobile or television, 
Adler said. Broadcasting, for example, "brought the salesman into the home," 
and advanced telephone technology will extend that phenomenon to "bring the 
stores into the home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Test Planned 
</P>
<P>
On a national scale, advanced telecommunications will get its first major 
commercial test later this year as the federal government begins phasing into 
operation an integrated telephone system that soon will tie together its vast 
and dispersed civilian work force. To perform the work, the General Services 
Administration awarded a pair of multibillion-dollar contracts last month to 
teams headed by AT&amp;T and U S Sprint to install the new system to serve the 
government's civilian employees nationwide into the new century. 
</P>
<P>
And in California, Fresno recently awarded a $2.9-million contract to Pacific 
Bell to build the state's first such advanced system. The city now must 
maintain two separate networks -- one to carry conversations, the other data, 
explained Paul Romito, assistant director of general services. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed something that would be good for 10 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These advanced phone systems, said Ahuja of Bell Labs, allow "even more 
flexibility in your working hours. If you get a great idea at midnight, you can 
get up and work on it. Or you can cross time zones" -- sending messages for 
retrieval during normal business hours -- "and yet, you can work the 
information in an integrated fashion -- voice, data or video." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just pushing along the natural thrust right now to make things more 
flexible," he said. "Communications are already going that way -- for example, 
with car phones. This does the same with information generally." 
</P>
<P>
Most local phone companies are testing such information services on a limited 
basis. In Cerritos, for example, GTE California is about to begin an ambitious 
program that will offer to a sampling of residents information services and 
cable television by phone line, with a wide selection of films and starting 
times. Eventually, these connections will be upgraded to high-capacity, 
static-free, fiber-optic cables, making live video transmissions possible, 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumer Interest 
</P>
<P>
One marketing goal is to learn just what services appeal to consumers -- not to 
mention what they are willing to pay for them, said Donald Bache, the project's 
general manager. "This is a real-world test of new services and technology." 
</P>
<P>
There will, of course, be a price to pay for the technology that makes these 
advanced phone services possible. The basic phone bill of those who subscribe 
to the new features will easily double from the $25 a month paid today by the 
typical California residential customer. Consumer groups are worried, however, 
that all of this new technology will inevitably also mean higher costs for all 
customers -- even those who only want inexpensive, local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T consultant Brennan maintains that "the bottom line is that if you 
don't want to do any of this you don't have to. It's kind of like broadcast TV 
versus cable TV versus pay TV. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be levels of telephone service," he said. "This will give you more 
options and greater flexibility. You'll be able to design your own telephone 
network."

NATIONAL PHYSICIANS' GROUP URGES BROAD FEDERAL HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring "our health-care system is failing," a national physicians' group 
Wednesday proposed a comprehensive federal health plan that would abolish 
private insurance but still guarantee medical care for every American. 
</P>
<P>
In news conferences around the country and in an article published today in the 
New England Journal of Medicine, doctors from Physicians for a National Health 
Program, a 1,200-member physicians' group, made their case for a fundamental 
change in the way medical bills are paid. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Dr. Howard Waitzkin, an internist and a 
founding member of the group, cited recent national surveys showing that there 
are now 35 million Americans with no insurance and another 20 million who are 
"under-insured," with coverage that does not pay for all their medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rekindles Debate 
</P>
<P>
Though the plan currently lacks congressional sponsorship, its publication in 
the prestigious journal rekindles the debate about publicly financed health 
insurance within the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"As practicing doctors, teachers and researchers, we're deeply troubled that 
many people can't get the most basic health services," Waitzkin said. "That has 
got to change." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerome Tobis, a UC Irvine professor who chairs the medical center's ethics 
committee, agreed, saying, "The health-care system today in America is a 
jungle, and correction is urgently needed." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for a National Health Program's solution is a plan, patterned after 
Canada's 20-year-old national health insurance program, that proponents say 
would cut bureaucracy, do away with the "often unjust dictates of insurance 
companies," save up to $50 billion annually but still allow patients to choose 
doctors, clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying premiums to insurance companies, individuals under the plan 
would be taxed, paying an amount roughly equivalent to their premium into a new 
national health program. Most employers could expect to pay slightly less than 
they are now paying for health insurance benefits, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
As Waitzkin and the medical journal article described it, patients would not be 
billed for any medical service. Rather, all medical costs would be paid 
directly to providers through the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, regional or statewide payment boards would negotiate fees 
with doctors. Also, the boards would set budgets for hospitals, group practices 
and health maintenance organizations, a practice that would "eliminate 
billing," according to the Physicians for a National Health Program article. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, regional planning boards composed of "expert and community 
representatives" would decided whether a hospital or clinic could make capital 
outlays for new diagnostic equipment. That decision would be based on need and 
quality," and "for-profit investment would be barred," the journal article 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Waitzkin and other Physicians for a National Health Program doctors said they 
would like to see demonstration projects in several states, including 
California, before the plan is enacted across the country. But they also hoped 
that their proposal, which currently has no congressional sponsor, would add 
new life to the controversy over national health insurance that has raged on 
and off again since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the California Medical Assn., 22% of all Californians 
have no medical insurance. In the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, 27% of residents 
are uninsured; 26% of San Diego County's residents have no insurance, and 23% 
of Orange County residents have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"What we hope is to spark debate," said Dr. Isaac Taylor, retired dean of the 
University of North Carolina Medical School, who kicked off the group's press 
conference in Boston on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That was the hope too of Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor in chief of the New 
England Journal of Medicine, who published the Physicians for a National Health 
Program article, as well as another plan for national health insurance in 
today's issue. 
</P>
<P>
The second paper in the journal, written by Alain Enthoven and Richard Kronick 
of Stanford University Business School, proposed a less radical plan for 
universal health insurance. Their program would retain private insurance but 
require employers to provide coverage for their workers. Those not covered at 
work would contribute through taxes, and poor people's coverage would be 
totally subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
The authors argued that a complete government takeover of health-care 
financing, such as the other group suggested, "would represent far too radical 
a change to be politically feasible in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Relman did not endorse either plan. But in what amounted to a call to arms to 
doctors, his editorial in the same edition referred to "our disastrously 
inadequate health-care financing system. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for our profession to make common cause with the government 
and with the major private payers in seeking solutions to a pressing social 
problem that is not going to solve itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Early reaction to the Physicians for a National Health Program plan ranged from 
quiet interest to flat rejection. Officials representing the 
multibillion-dollar insurance industry suggested that such a plan was absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the American public wants a monolithic health-care system," 
said Pat Schoeni, director of public affairs for Health Insurance Assn. of 
America, a Washington lobby that represents 350 national health insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's certainly problems with the (health) system. . . . Certainly 
people are not covered," Schoeni continued. "But the vast majority of people 
have health care, and everybody has access to emergency care. You may be able 
to fix the pieces that are wrong without having to redo the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William G. Plested III, a Santa Monica thoracic surgeon who is 
president-elect of the California Medical Assn., agreed that there is a 
"crisis" in health care because of the large number of Americans who are 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
However, Plested also questioned whether U.S. consumers would accept a 
Canadian-style health plan in which high-tech medical supplies are rationed, 
with some clinics getting scanning machines but others only allowed to have 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the American consumer will stand for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Schoeni, Plested argued against "dismantling" the whole medical system. 
</P>
<P>
But one consumer advocate, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen 
Health Research Group in Washington, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who say, 'It ain't broke; don't fix it,' are wrong," Wolfe said. "Our 
country is in a worldwide scandal with its failure to act. It's the only 
industrialized country outside South Africa that does not have national health 
insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe said he agrees with "many elements" of the Physicians for a National 
Health Program plan, but "the point is we have to get a national health plan. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who says we don't need national health insurance is just off the wall," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Physicians for a National Health Program has no congressional sponsor 
for its national health plan, Waitzkin said, some elements of the plan are 
contained in pending national and California legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In Congress, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) will continue to push legislation 
that would require all employers to provide health insurance for their workers, 
Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan said. But unlike the Physicians for a National 
Health Program proposal, the federal government would play no role in the 
Kennedy plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no political support" for national health insurance, Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the House, Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) plans to reintroduce 
legislation to establish a national health service, Dellums' aide Max Miller 
said. Under the bill, which has been pending in revised form since 1977, health 
care would be funded out of general revenues, progressive taxation of 
individuals and employer contributions. Under the plan community boards would 
select area health-care providers, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the House, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) plans to reintroduce a 
measure, similar to the Kennedy bill in the Senate, that would require all 
employers, regardless of size, to enroll their workers in a health-care plan. 
It would also prescribe minimum health benefits for all employees. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) plans to reintroduce a bill he 
first proposed in 1987 that would set up a California health insurance plan. 
The proposal, which died in committee last year, would not eliminate private 
insurance, Hauser said, but would require all employers to pay at least 50% of 
a worker's health insurance costs.

AFTER 3 YEARS, GIRL NEEDS NEW HEART DONOR 
</P>

<P>
A new heart is needed by a 17-year-old girl whose body is rejecting the heart 
of a friend that was transplanted into her after his unexpected death three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Ashlock has been treated for 10 episodes of organ rejection since she 
received the heart of her classmate, Felipe Garza Jr., her father said, so her 
doctors are seeking a new donor for another transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a new heart they were going to give her last Thursday night, but it 
didn't match," Ray Ashlock said Tuesday at their home in this Central 
California farming town. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Ashlock's case became famous because of the circumstances surrounding the 
heart that has been beating in her body since January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Garza, a 15-year-old who had a crush on Ashlock, knew that she had a 
degenerative heart disease and would not live much longer without a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had not been ill, Garza told his parents, farm workers, that he 
wanted his heart donated to her after his death. A short time later on Jan. 4, 
1986, he died unexpectedly when a blood vessel burst in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
As Garza wished, his friend, then 14, received his heart in an operation at 
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. Patterson's City Council 
named a park in the boy's honor. The family has since moved away from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Ashlock has had to return to the hospital 75 miles northwest of her home often 
since the operation for organ rejection treatment and check-ups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejection Common 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Millhouse said it is fairly common for a body to 
reject a transplanted organ. "In 5% to 10% of the cases, there is chronic 
rejection. She's been through a lot and she's handled herself well." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Ashlock said his medical insurance as a city employee did not cover all the 
$500,000 cost of Donna's initial operation, and bills for treatment and 
transportation have mounted since, leaving him wondering if he can ever pay off 
all of his daughter's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some bills that are $35,000 a whack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Ashlock, who turns 18 on April 1, is anxiously awaiting another heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be better off with a new one," said the teen-ager, who studies at 
home since her condition keeps her from attending regular classes at Patterson 
High School. She will graduate this spring if she can stay well enough to 
maintain her grades. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to go to college and become a nurse, not because she has had so many 
nurses care for her, but because "I like helping people and stuff."

LUCKIEST MAN KEEPS ON SPINNING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The luckiest man in the history of the California State Lottery's "Big Spin" 
says he owes his good fortune to Abe Lincoln and Japan's tallest mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo resident Warrick Woodard will make an unprecedented third appearance 
on the televised "Big Spin" show Saturday night -- armed with some pebbles from 
Fujiyama and a Lincoln penny he found in a parking lot. Three others have 
appeared twice. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard, a 48-year-old U.S. Navy boatswain's mate stationed at Port Hueneme, 
said Wednesday that kissing the penny and the rocks last year before spinning 
the lottery's wheel of fortune helped him win a total of $1,010,000 in his 
first two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a poor country boy making $25,000 a year before I found this penny and 
took out this holy rock from my collection of travel mementos," Woodard said in 
a lazy, Southern drawl. 
</P>
<P>
He is the first person in the state lottery's three-year history to win three 
chances to spin the wheel, lottery spokesman John Schade said. Lottery 
officials hold a weekly drawing of scratch-off ticket winners to select 
contestants for the half-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds of getting picked three times can't be calculated. But it's safe to 
say they are really astronomical," Schade said. "This guy has the luckiest 
streak of anyone I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Woodard is guaranteed to win $10,000 simply by appearing on the show, Schade 
said. But if his luck holds out, Woodard could win $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Things certainly weren't going so well for the enlisted man early last year, 
Woodard said. He and his wife, Darlene, were living on opposite coasts while 
waiting for affordable housing to open up at the Ventura County base. 
</P>
<P>
Then the sailor, who was living in barracks, found his lucky penny in the 
parking lot of a convenience store near Port Hueneme and began buying about 12 
scratch-off lottery tickets a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won $10,000 on the show in April. Five weeks later, he won $1 million, which 
lottery officials said he will receive in $50,000 annual installments over the 
next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Woodard, 40, promptly moved out to Camarillo from Stafford, Va., and 
the couple bought a $250,000 house and a new car. 
</P>
<P>
Their phenomenal luck hasn't changed the couple all that much, Warrick Woodard 
says. He does not plan to retire from the Navy until 1993, when his hitch is 
up, although he says he is considering starting a second career as a building 
contractor.

REFUGEES GIVEN MORE TIME TO LEAVE S. TEXAS

A judge Wednesday extended for three weeks the period in which Central American 
asylum-seekers can leave South Texas, where an immigration policy was blamed 
for trapping hundreds in desperate conditions. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit 
filed last week against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The hearing 
had been scheduled for today, when a temporary restraining order against the 
INS policy was to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The order issued Monday restored the right for asylum-seekers to travel to U.S. 
destinations while their cases are resolved, a right they will retain until the 
rescheduled hearing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds Stage Exodus 
</P>
<P>
The order inspired an exodus of hundreds of Central Americans from the Lower 
Rio Grande Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something fine for us, because we can go be with our families, and here 
in the valley we don't have anybody," said Ana Rodriguez, a 23-year-old 
Honduran headed for Austin, where she has relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 16 INS policy under fire required asylum-seekers to stay close to the 
application center nearest their point of entry while their requests are 
considered. Many Central Americans enter the United States in southern Texas 
and file their requests at the busy center in Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
The policy left Rodriguez and other aliens unable to leave the area, where they 
resorted to living in primitive camps, abandoned buildings and church shelters.

MEXICO'S ARREST OF OIL UNION CHIEF SPURS PANIC BUYING AT GAS STATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican motorists jammed gas stations in panic buying and armed soldiers 
guarded most of the nation's refineries against possible sabotage Wednesday 
after the violent arrest of the leader of the oil workers union on arms 
smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the powerful union chief, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, the day 
before provoked early morning work stoppages and slowdowns Wednesday at several 
of the state oil company's installations, but most of the workers apparently 
were back on the job after receiving orders from union leaders meeting in 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The government news agency Notimex reported that the navy was protecting 
coastal installations and oil tankers in the Gulf of Mexico. Reporters in 
Campeche state said military airplanes were circling the 36 offshore drilling 
platforms in Campeche Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The government had feared violence by some of the nearly 200,000 oil workers 
who are considered to be fiercely loyal to Hernandez Galicia, but there were no 
reports of disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met privately with Fidel Velasquez, the 
leader of the Mexican Workers Congress, the umbrella group for organized labor 
in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI. The oil workers 
union is a key sector of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to meet today with the congress' entire executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina, is the popular and allegedly corrupt 
power behind the union in the nation's strategic oil industry. He was detained 
by federal police and the army Tuesday morning at his home in Ciudad Madero in 
the coastal state of Tamaulipas, after a gun battle with his bodyguards that 
left one federal agent dead. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office said 44 other people have been arrested in 
conjunction with the case, including the secretary general of the union, 
Salvador Barragan Camacho. Barragan Camacho, who turned himself over to 
authorities before dawn Wednesday, is in police custody at a Mexico City 
hospital, where he is being treated for a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
Security agents found 200 Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns and thousands of 
rounds of ammunition in Hernandez Galicia's house and are charging the union 
leader with arms stockpiling and smuggling, the attorney general's office 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials charge that Hernandez Galicia was conspiring to take over 
installations of the state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, to 
destabilize the government. 
</P>
<P>
An opposition member of the federal Chamber of Deputies, however, was quoted in 
the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada as saying he saw the army plant the guns 
in Hernandez Galicia's house. Alfredo Pliego Aldana, a member of the leftist 
National Democratic Front, said, "I was there . . . (the army) brought the 
weapons in a military truck, unloaded them and took them into La Quina's 
house." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charge by Unionists 
</P>
<P>
Union officials charge that the government has framed Hernandez Galicia and 
other leaders in a political move to break their power and that of the union. 
In a simultaneous attack on Hernandez Galicia's economic interests, the 
government arrested Sergio Bolanos, the businessman who is said to handle 
Hernandez Galicia's business affairs. Bolanos and several of his associates are 
accused of evading $1.5 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman who declined to be identified by name said that two of 
Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards in detention told authorities that they murdered 
one of Hernandez Galicia's rivals in 1983 on orders from their boss. According 
to the official, the bodyguards said they killed Oscar Torres Pancardo, mayor 
of Poza Rica in the state of Veracruz, who appeared to have died in a 
mysterious car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soldiers surrounded several of the country's nine refineries while 
troops in army jeeps escorted trucks delivering gasoline to stations throughout 
the country. Motorists fearing an eventual strike waited in long gas lines that 
clogged streets throughout the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are panicked and we have long lines because they think there is 
going to be a shortage," said Alberto Servin, an attendant at one Pemex gas 
station. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas in Short Supply 
</P>
<P>
With the high demand, some stations ran out of gas, but Pemex officials 
guaranteed that all stations would have gas today. 
</P>
<P>
In Ciudad Madero, where the union headquarters is situated, state officials 
reported stores and gas stations closed and a morning demonstration in the 
central square by about 3,000 union members protesting "the kidnaping" of 
Hernandez Galicia. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers are disoriented and alarmed," said Manuel Montiel, spokesman for 
the state government. 
</P>
<P>
By afternoon, however, the Notimex news agency reported that "hundreds of 
workers" had gone back to the refinery there after receiving orders from the 
local union leader. 
</P>
<P>
In the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Oaxaca, reporters said that protesting 
workers returned to their jobs by midday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tabasco, a local newspaper reporter said that soldiers were searching 
employees as they entered the 25 Pemex work sites. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's arrests have met with mixed reactions. Business leaders generally 
have lauded the move while the leftist opposition has protested the violent and 
allegedly illegal way in which Hernandez Galicia was detained. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of a permanent joint committee of Congress, lawmaker Jesus Ortega 
of the opposition Democratic Front called the arrest a "classic example of 
state terror." He said the oil union was targeted because "the government does 
not want an obstacle to its policy of privatizing the nation's industries." 
</P>
<P>
President Salinas favors selling off many of the government enterprises and 
breaking up others.

BRITISH GROUND 737S TO CHECK WARNING SYSTEMS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE TERMED 'PRECAUTIONARY'; POSSIBILITY OF INSTRUMENT FAILURE SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority, in what it described Wednesday as a 
"precautionary" move, ordered British airlines to ground all their late-model 
Boeing 737 aircraft pending an inspection of their engine fire-warning systems. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first suggestion that some sort of instrument failure may have 
contributed to last Sunday's crash of British Midland Airways Flight 092. 
Forty-four passengers died and 82 other passengers and crew were injured as 
their crippled aircraft undershot the runway at a central England airport 
during an emergency landing attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it is also "urgently" preparing detailed instructions for more 
frequent mandatory engine inspections on the newer Boeing 737s, as well as 
European-built Airbus A-320s, which use the same power plant but have different 
warning systems. Initial checks will have to be performed on those airplanes 
within 24 hours of the new instruction being issued, according to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it was acting upon recommendation of investigators probing the 
British Midland crash, which involved a 12-week-old Boeing 737-400 series 
twin-engine jet. And while the Transport Ministry stressed in a separate 
statement Wednesday that "much work remains to be done" to pin down the exact 
cause of the disaster, the order served to shift speculation back toward 
technical malfunction after speculation the day before that pilot error might 
have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
While the order immediately affects only 37 aircraft here, it has implications 
for several times that many planes, many of them in service with American 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the International Air Transport Assn. said in a telephone 
interview from Geneva on Wednesday that more than 250 aircraft have been 
equipped with the late model CFM-56 engines that are subject of the CAA order. 
That order, he added, puts "fairly compelling pressure on other governments to 
take similar steps," if only because of the potential liability if there were 
now a similar accident involving the targeted planes. 
</P>
<P>
Alerted to developments by the British, the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration ordered similar warning-system inspections of 300 late model 
737s flown by American carriers, wires 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starboard Engine Cut 
</P>
<P>
According to the official account of the England crash so far, Flight 092 pilot 
Kevin Hunt reported shortly after taking off from London's Heathrow Airport for 
Belfast, Northern Ireland, on Sunday evening that he had shut down his 
starboard (right) engine because of a fire. He was diverted to the East 
Midlands airfield, Britain's 11th largest, about 110 miles northwest of here. 
</P>
<P>
As he neared East Midlands, witnesses reported that his port (left) engine was 
in flames, and the aircraft slammed into an embankment alongside England's 
busiest highway, the M-1, breaking into three pieces. It was about 500 yards 
from the end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence obtained early in the investigation indicated that both the No. 1 
(port) and No. 2 (starboard) engines might have suffered a related failure," 
according to a Transport Ministry statement Wednesday. While physical evidence 
as well as information from the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders 
confirmed in-flight failure and fire of the port engine, investigators have so 
far found no evidence of fire or other malfunction in the starboard engine. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed that "a great deal of significant evidence relating to 
this (starboard) engine has yet to be obtained." However, its findings had 
fueled widespread speculation here that Hunt might have mistakenly shut down 
his "good" (starboard) engine instead of an already crippled port engine. 
</P>
<P>
"Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine," asserted the main headline in the tabloid 
Sun newspaper Wednesday. "Fatal Error," proclaimed the Daily Star. 
</P>
<P>
While pilot error may still prove to be a factor, however, the aviation 
authority's announcement made it clear that such judgments are at least 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
The airplane's engine monitoring system includes separate heat and vibration 
sensors in the left and right engines, and separate alarms in the cabin to warn 
of a problem, according to aircraft experts here. At one point, however, the 
left and right systems pass through a common circuit. 
</P>
<P>
What the agency's directive means, these experts said, is that it is now 
thought possible that because of some technical fault, the warning system in 
Flight 092's cabin may have indicated fire in the right engine when it was 
actually the left that was malfunctioning. That could have misled Hunt into 
shutting down the wrong engine, according to this theory. 
</P>
<P>
From the cockpit, it is impossible to see either engine on a Boeing 737, the 
experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Source Found 
</P>
<P>
"They have pinpointed a possible source of the problems the captain 
experienced," commented Freddy Yetman, technical secretary of Britain's Air 
Pilots Assn. He added that the association had "protested strongly" over 
earlier suggestions of pilot error because they were "without a shred of 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Yetman conceded that it also "seems unimaginable" that the ultra-sensitive 
engine fire warning system could have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Workmen removed both engines as well as the wreckage of the fuselage from the 
M-1 embankment Wednesday, shifting it onto the road itself until it can be 
hauled away for further inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The engines will be taken to the facilities outside Paris of SNECMA, the French 
manufacturer which, in partnership with America's General Electric, makes the 
CFM. There, the power plants are to be stripped down to find out what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Transport Ministry officials here said it is still possible that closer 
analysis will reveal a malfunction of the starboard engine that was not 
apparent from the on-site inspection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunt Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Also as part of their continuing probe, officials of the Air Accident 
Investigations Board questioned Hunt in the hospital Wednesday. He is at least 
temporarily paralyzed with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he is being treated, said 
Hunt was "anxious" before the meeting but relieved afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Pepperman, the doctor in charge of the intensive care unit, said that 
while hospital staff had kept from Hunt some of the harshest press accounts so 
as not to undermine his medical recovery, "we have made him aware of the 
comments that have been raised, and he hasn't passed any comment." 
</P>

Following the Air Accident Board's recommendations, the Civil Aviation 
Authority said British airlines flying Boeing 737-300 and 737-400 series 
aircraft "are being required to carry out checks of the fire, overheat, and 
vibration monitoring systems on their aircraft." While the ill-fated British 
Midlands plane was a 737-400, it is basically a stretched version of the 
737-300. It uses virtually the identical CFM-56 engines. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier versions of the 737 carry a different engine.There are also earlier 
versions of the CFM-56 engines that are not affected by the agency's order. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's crash, there are three Boeing 737-400s on the British registry 
of commercial aircraft, and all were immediately grounded voluntarily by their 
operators. The new engine warning system checks "are required to be 
satisfactorily completed before further flight," the CAA said. 
</P>
<P>
Checks on Series 300 Boeing 737s "must be carried out before the first flight 
after midnight tonight," Wednesday's order said. There are 30 Series 300 
aircraft in use here, operated by nine different airlines. The carriers said 
they hope to carry out the checks without disrupting their schedules.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it is ordering new 
engine inspections for 300 Boeing 737-400 and Boeing 737-300 aircraft after the 
crash of a 737-400 in England last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said its directive requires the inspection of the engine fire-warning 
system and the vibration monitoring circuitry on the eight Boeing 737-400 and 
292 Boeing 737-300 planes operated by U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the U.S. airlines operating the new Boeing 737-400 and the older 
Boeing 737-300 would be required to make the new, one-hour inspection within 72 
hours of receiving the order.

As many as 10,000 Soviet Jews were allowed to visit relatives in Israel last 
year in a wave inspired by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of 
more openness, it was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arrivals began last spring and "in 1988 we figure there were between 8,000 and 
10,000 who visited," said Rabbi Richard Hirsch, executive director of the World 
Union for Progressive Judaism, a private lobby. 
</P>
<P>
He said that even more Soviet Jews could visit this year. "We consider this a 
harbinger of better times," said Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, many of whom travel on tickets paid for by kin in Israel, have 
tourist visas and stay as long as three months.

ASPIN URGES NEW WAYS TO FUND WEAPONS 
</P>

The Defense Department, facing flat or declining budgets for the foreseeable 
future, should adopt a radical new approach to planning and financing the 
nation's strategic forces, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the National Press Club, Rep. Les Aspin proposed pooling all of 
the funds now spent by the military services on long-range nuclear weapons and 
the "Star Wars" missile defense system, keeping the figure constant for 10 
years and buying new systems one after another, rather than in small pieces all 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predicts More Stability 
</P>
<P>
The result, Aspin said, would be funding stability for key programs and a 
chance to build a consensus on costly weapons like the MX missile and the B-2 
stealth bomber that have generated intense political controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"With everything on the table, imaginative solutions and political consensus 
have a chance to emerge," the Wisconsin Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci called the proposal "an interesting idea," 
but said that it poses problems if Congress later goes back on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci cited the MX missile, which is not very popular in Congress, and 
questioned whether lawmakers would be willing to agree to a long-range 
financing plan without the right they now have to review the program on a 
year-to-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
If lawmakers decided to stop funding the MX, Carlucci noted, the Pentagon would 
be faced with huge "termination costs" that must be paid to contractors if a 
contract is canceled before its agreed-upon end date. 
</P>
<P>
"You not only don't get the savings, but you lose a considerable amount of 
money," Carlucci said Tuesday in a session with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin's plan would take the $31 billion now spent annually on all strategic 
systems -- ballistic missiles, long-range bombers, missile-carrying submarines 
and the "Star Wars" space-based program -- and keep the number steady after 
inflation for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Surge or Starve' 
</P>
<P>
That would allow military planners to decide which systems best meet military 
requirements and quickly build and develop them. Under the Reagan 
Administration's "surge or starve" defense budgeting, weapons have gotten 
started at high production rates, then have been slowed drastically because of 
spending cuts. The result is program instability and inefficient production, 
Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a 10-year plan, as one program begins to tail off, another can be fit in 
and funded. The sequencing of programs becomes the prime consideration," he 
said. "The question is no longer merely either/or. It is also sooner or later."

LATINOS FACE ANOTHER 'HARD DECADE,' STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Calling the 1980s "a hard decade for Hispanics" in the United States, a 
research group Wednesday predicted an increase in Latino poverty, unemployment 
and discrimination in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization that analyzes 
population trends, said in a new report that the growing Latino population, 
burdened by inadequate education and poor English language skills, is suffering 
severely from a lack of good jobs, affordable housing and opportunities to 
achieve a better life style. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for significant improvements in the next few years do not seem 
great, but longer term changes can be made through a concerted effort by the 
Latino community, business leaders and the government, said Rafael Valdivieso, 
author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Attention 
</P>
<P>
"We need to focus national attention on the Hispanic community to solve these 
problems," Valdivieso said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso said the growing Latino community must focus on becoming more 
educated and politically involved. 
</P>
<P>
While the report said that Latinos are "grossly under-represented politically," 
Valdivieso said the next decade offers a chance for members of the group to 
become active in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, a third of the Latino population cannot vote because it 
does not have citizenship and many of those who are eligible to vote are not 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an enormous potential for political involvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sounding one optimistic note, he said that "the 1988 presidential campaign 
marks the first national election in which the Hispanic vote has been openly 
courted." 
</P>
<P>
Valdivieso, a vice president for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, 
called on business and industry to address the plight of Latinos by offering 
more job opportunities and paying more attention to the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispanics could fill a need by both business and government for literate, 
English-Spanish bilingual professionals" and they "make up a $130-billion 
market that is relatively untapped," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Using this potential "will help to make the United States more competitive in 
the world," Valdivieso said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said some Latino leaders believe the community has "been brought 
together by the lack of attention," he added that "this has been a hard decade 
for Hispanics and the Reagan Administration has to take its share of the blame 
for that."

SURVEY EXAMINES HOUSING, JOBS, LAW; 
</P>
<P>
BLACKS, WHITES DISAGREE OVER BASIC RACIAL ISSUES 
</P>

<P>
In a vivid illustration of the gulf still dividing American society, a new 
national survey released Wednesday found dramatic disagreement between blacks 
and whites about the severity of racial problems in such basic areas as 
education, housing, job opportunities and the law. 
</P>
<P>
For example, two-thirds of the whites surveyed believe that black people "get 
equal pay for equal work," while two-thirds of blacks believe just the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, half of the black people surveyed said that local police "keep 
blacks down," while an equal percentage of white people said that police are 
more helpful than harmful to blacks, according to the study, which was 
conducted by Louis Harris for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"These gaps in perception underscore the need for continuing educational 
efforts to help white Americans appreciate that race continues to be a factor 
in influencing our daily lives," the study's authors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Experiences 
</P>
<P>
James O. Gibson, who directs the Rockefeller Foundation's national programs on 
equal opportunity, said that the gap stems from the differences in experiences 
among blacks and whites. "If people aren't touched by (racial bias) then they 
have no informed basis for an attitude," he said. "It's the out-of-sight, 
out-of-mind factor." 
</P>
<P>
On housing, 55% of whites said that blacks are not worse off than other groups 
with comparable education and income, but 64% of blacks believe they are worse 
off. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the study found significant areas of agreement. About 8 of 10 
respondents of both races, for instance, agreed that more money should be spent 
attacking the causes of crime -- such as poverty and lack of motivation -- than 
on sentencing criminals to long jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of every 10 blacks and whites also believe in the need for special school 
programs to motivate poor youngsters to stay in school. And 9 of every 10 
members of both races support efforts to locate more jobs in areas where poor 
people live, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"While there are some differences among whites and blacks, there is compelling 
evidence that the public is ready to get on with the business of attending to 
many of the race-relations issues that have not been addressed during the past 
eight years," Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Affirmative Neglect' 
</P>
<P>
His comment reflects the view, held by many black people, that the election of 
George Bush offers minorities and poor people an opportunity to reverse some of 
the social policies initiated by President Reagan, who practiced what one fund 
official called "affirmative neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fiscal handcuffs about to be passed on from Reagan to Bush because 
of the huge federal deficit, Chambers asserted that "some new programs will be 
necessary" to improve conditions for the impoverished. The programs "will cost 
something," he said, "but it's a worthwhile investment." 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of the depth of negative feelings black people hold against Reagan 
and an example of the perceptual gap between blacks and whites generally, the 
survey found that half of the whites questioned believe his Administration has 
been helpful to blacks while almost 80% of blacks in the survey consider the 
Administration oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some areas of agreement between the races, whites continue to 
stereotype blacks, the study found, noting that more than a third of whites 
think that "blacks tend to have less ambition than whites" and a fifth believe 
that "blacks breed crime." The study said that 17% of whites believe that 
"blacks have less native intelligence than whites." 
</P>
<P>
While these figures represent a decline in stereotyping since 1963, "that level 
of bias indicates that the anti-black virus among whites is still abundant and 
not hard to find," the study said. It found similar views among Asians and 
Latinos, noting, for instance, that one-third of Asian-Americans and one-fourth 
of Latinos who identified themselves as white feel that "blacks breed crime." 
</P>
<P>
The survey, called "The Unfinished Agenda on Race in America," was conducted 
from June to September and included 3,123 interviews with people of all races. 
</P>
<P>
The fund also released a separate survey of blacks who are persistently poor, 
finding that many do not receive federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Special Training 
</P>
<P>
That survey of 347 people in eight cities, including Los Angeles, New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago, found that only 11% said they receive 
federal or state housing subsidies to help pay rent and that only 15% have ever 
received special job training. 
</P>
<P>
A huge majority of these poor people, called part of the "underclass," said 
they want more education, the survey said, adding that "finding productive 
work" was the most important objective cited in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
This survey "decisively refutes the notion that the people in the underclass 
have no desire to lift themselves out of poverty," the study said. However, the 
study called the lack of child-care facilities "the major stumbling block" 
faced by poor women seeking work, with 86% of the single mothers surveyed 
getting no child care help from their family or the government.

CUT THE STATIC AND POSTAGE COSTS, GTE ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission ordered GTE California on Wednesday 
to reduce static on its telephone lines by 30% during the next three years and 
to develop a plan for cutting the cost of postage on bills to its 3 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The actions were the latest in a series of PUC orders aimed at prompting GTE to 
reduce costs and improve the quality of its telephone service. The commission 
has been examining the company's operations after customer complaints made 
during public hearings in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
GTE could improve its transmission quality by replacing equipment and improving 
maintenance of its telephone lines, said Norman Johnson, the administrative law 
judge who wrote the orders for the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
Most customers of GTE California, formerly known as General Telephone, are in 
the Los Angeles-Orange County area, but the company also serves parts of 
Northern California, as well as Palm Springs and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate Increases 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, GTE received approval for several substantial rate 
increases after telling the PUC that it needed increased revenue to pay for new 
equipment. During the 1970s, customers had complained strongly about the 
quality of the company's service. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that GTE transmission quality has improved since then, because 
much new equipment has been installed, but that further improvement is needed. 
</P>
<P>
After studying complaints about the physical size of GTE's bills, the 
commission concluded that the bills are made up of too many pages. Carole 
Kretzer, a PUC spokeswoman, said GTE's billing format does not make efficient 
use of paper and that the utility has been paying twice the normal postage to 
send some bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything they can do to reduce postage will reduce the budget, and that will 
lead to lower rates" for customers, Kretzer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Billing Problems 
</P>
<P>
The commission's order requires GTE to develop and submit a plan for reducing 
the number of billing pages within 150 days. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, GTE has ordered new bill-printing equipment, 
machinery that will be delivered later this year, according to Stephanie 
Bardfield, spokeswoman for GTE. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking steps to make the bills more user-friendly -- to reduce the pages 
without reducing the size of the print," Bardfield said. "There are lots of 
other areas where we'd like to spend, other than postage." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also said Wednesday that GTE has also improved its relations 
with its customers since the early 1980s but that more work is also needed in 
this area. The company is responding to customers' complaints more promptly, 
the agency said, but it added that some customers have reported discourteous 
treatment by GTE representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC cited a 1986 poll in which 94% of GTE's customers said their service 
was adequate, good or excellent. A 1982 poll showed that only about 65% were 
satisfied.

WILDLIFE OFFICIAL WHO RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS DISMISSED

<TEXT>
<P>
Rolf Wallenstrom, director of the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service who raised concerns about offshore oil drilling in California and 
agricultural pollution at western wildlife refuges, has been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Calling himself the target of agency politics, Wallenstrom, 56, confirmed 
Tuesday that he has been fired effective Friday. He said he is considering an 
appeal to the federal Merit System Review Board or a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Interior officials said Wallenstrom was terminated for refusing a 
transfer to a new post. Wallenstrom contended the job was created to isolate 
him from decision-making in several western states. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenstrom, based in Portland, Ore., argued that he was the victim of a 
political vendetta by Fish and Wildlife Director Frank Dunkle. Dunkle, who is 
seeking reappointment, has rejected UPI requests for interviews on the 
Wallenstrom matter. 
</P>
<P>
He issued a statement Tuesday expressing regret that a career employee "had 
chosen to leave the service under unfortunate circumstances." He said 
Wallenstrom "tried to politicize an issue that had nothing to do with 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Wallenstrom said a decision to appeal would be "influenced by whether Frank 
Dunkle is reappointed. If he leaves and I leave, then I will not appeal," 
Wallenstrom said. "If he is maintained, and if I can afford it, I probably will 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who has tried to save Wallenstrom's job, said 
she was "appalled" at his firing. "It was bad enough he was reassigned and now 
he's been fired for trying to do an objective job," Boxer said. 
</P>
<P>
Boxer led a group of 20 members of Congress from four states who requested an 
investigation by the General Accounting Office in November into the Wallenstrom 
matter and other alleged efforts by Dunkle to politicize the agency. That 
investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began last summer after disclosure of an internal report that said 
oil drilling off the Northern California coast could have disastrous 
environmental consequences. President-elect Bush supported the oil drilling 
proposals until the report was leaked to the news media. Wallenstrom said 
Dunkle unfairly blamed him for leaking the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkle said he wanted Wallenstrom to take a newly created position to oversee 
investigations into pollution problems at the Kesterson National Wildlife 
Refuge in Central California and at other western wildlife refuges polluted by 
Interior Department irrigation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Wallenstrom refused to take the position and Dunkle called for his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Recce, the department's deputy assistant secretary for fish and wildlife 
and parks, wrote a five-page letter to Wallenstrom last week upholding the 
firing.

Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), whose office was raided in August by 
the FBI as part of its Capitol sting operation, has been elected majority whip 
by her fellow Democrats, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said the 
action was to let people know that "we have confidence" Moore. The whip is the 
member responsible for alerting fellow Democrats to caucus positions and for 
tallying support and opposition before floor votes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 and in 1988, Moore was author of special-interest bills to benefit 
phony companies set up by the FBI in the sting. They passed but were vetoed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off. 
</P>
<P>
Moore received $10,500 in campaign contributions from the businessmen, 
including $3,500 funneled through a lobbying firm and a $5,000 contribution, 
which she promptly returned.

Steven Seagal was definitely the action/adventure find of 1988. His "Above the 
Law" continues to be a strong rental -- No. 5 on the Billboard magazine chart. 
Few expected it to be this high on the chart or to have such longevity (nine 
weeks on the chart). Seagal is a challenger for the No. 2 spot -- battling 
Stallone and Chuck Norris -- behind action/adventure king Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. "Bloodsport," a bloody martial arts flick starring Jean Claude 
Van Damme, is making a big splash on the rental chart (No. 17 after two weeks). 
</P>
<P>
* "Red Heat," debuting at an impressive No. 11, should be the red-hot rental of 
the next few weeks. This one wasn't great box-office, but many of those 
Schwarzenegger fans who missed it in the theaters will probably rent it.

The pilot killed in the crash of a light plane in fog on Pleasanton Ridge 
earlier in the week was identified as Barbara S. Gellman, 43, a Newport Beach 
attorney and businesswoman. Authorities said Gellman, the mother of three, was 
en route to Oakland from John Wayne Airport in Orange County for a business 
meeting when her plane crashed at about the 1,000-foot level of the ridge. The 
Federal Aviation Administration said she had radioed air traffic controllers 
for assistance as she was approaching Oakland. Controllers three times radioed 
warnings that she was flying too low in the poor visibility. Investigators said 
she acknowledged one warning.

Geologists have discovered an "inactive" fault near the Savannah River Plant 
nuclear weapons complex in South Carolina, according to a report by the Energy 
Department. The Pen Branch Fault runs within half a mile of the K-Reactor and 
the site of a proposed reactor scheduled for construction beginning in 1991 or 
1992, according to Steve Wright of the department. He said the other two 
reactors on the site, the P-Reactor and the L-Reactor, are several miles from 
the fault, a fracture or zone of fractures in rock strata where pressure and 
displacement can cause earthquakes.

Vietnam has told the United States that it will return the apparent remains of 
25 Americans killed in the Vietnam War and also let five U.S. teams into the 
country to investigate incidents involving missing Americans, Pentagon 
officials said. The 25 sets of remains will be repatriated Jan. 23 when an 
American cargo plane flies to Hanoi. The remains will then be flown to Hawaii 
for identification. The five teams of specialists will arrive in Hanoi this 
weekend to work with Vietnamese counterparts in the fourth such 10-day joint 
mission.

President-elect Bush, who will attend the Feb. 24 funeral for Japanese Emperor 
Hirohito in Tokyo, said he is not worried about possible criticism over 
honoring the emperor of a wartime enemy. "We have a good relationship with 
Japan. I want to see it even better," said Bush, a former Navy flier whose 
plane was shot down by the Japanese in the Pacific in 1944. "I feel you look 
ahead, not always look back." Bush, who will become President on Jan. 20, said 
he has no plans to visit other Asian countries during the trip. He is expected 
to be accompanied by James A. Baker III, his choice for secretary of state.

The Constitution's ban against cruel and inhuman punishment does not shield a 
retarded killer from execution even if the defendant has the mind of a 
7-year-old, the U.S. Supreme Court was told. Assistant Atty. Gen. Charles A. 
Palmer of Texas urged the justices to permit the execution of Johnny Paul 
Penry, 32, whose reasoning capacity has been described as that of a child of 7. 
"He knew what he was doing," Palmer said of Penry, who stabbed to death Pamela 
Moseley Carpenter, 22, on Oct. 15, 1979, in Livingston, Tex., after he raped 
her. Palmer recited evidence that Penry killed the woman to prevent her from 
identifying him. A ruling is expected by early July.

France has asked Syria to extradite wanted Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner, the 
French Foreign Ministry said. Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, who tracked Brunner 
to Syria 16 years ago, described him as the most important Nazi war criminal 
still alive. Brunner has been accused of organizing the deportation of 100,000 
Jews from Germany, France and Slovakia to Nazi death camps during World War II. 
There have been reports that Brunner, 76, is responsible for reorganizing 
Syria's secret services. Syria says it has no knowledge of him. Brunner, 
sentenced to death in absentia by a French court in 1954, has been described as 
the right-hand man of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who masterminded the 
extermination of Jews.

The U.S.-backed Contras announced a new peace proposal and again called for new 
talks, despite last month's refusal by Nicaragua's Sandinista government to 
resume direct peace negotiations. The new plan, announced in Miami, sets a 
six-month deadline for the completion of democratic reforms in Nicaragua 
instead of a 70-day deadline and also drops a longstanding demand for the 
removal of Nicaragua's Supreme Court justices. Contra leader Adolfo Calero 
called the new plan more flexible and said it will be delivered to Managua 
after first being presented to the presidents of other Central American 
countries.

COSTA RICA DEBT-FOR-NATURE TRADE DUE TO PROTECT LAND

Conservationists have made their largest single debt-for-nature swap, buying 
$5.6 million in discounted debt for $784,000 to help protect over 355,000 acres 
in Costa Rica, an environmental group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy, an international land conservation group, said it 
purchased the debt from American Express Bank in the fifth debt-for-nature 
transaction and the one with the largest face value so far. 
</P>
<P>
"The over $3 million generated by the debt swap transaction will fund park 
protection, conservation training, educational programs, biological inventories 
and land acquisitions variously at nine conservation projects throughout the 
country," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The debt will be converted to Costa Rican currency bonds valued at $1.7 
million. The bonds, paying an average yearly interest of 25% over five years, 
are expected to generate more than $3 million, the Nature Conservancy said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Wildlife Fund made the previous biggest swap, valued at $5.4 million 
in March, 1988, also in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is experiencing the highest deforestation rate, outside of its 
parks, of any country in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the Costa Rican National Parks Foundation, a 
private organization, and authorized by the Costa Rican Natural Resources 
Ministry and the Central Bank.

Blanca Quintero has lived nervously in this country for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Afraid that she was "not smart enough" to become a legal resident, the Mexican 
native avoided the government for years and lived quietly and anonymously with 
her two children. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, who has worked as a housekeeper for five years for John Gavin, former 
U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said, "I was afraid to go out because I thought the 
police were going to get me and send me back to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, Quintero said she was "set free" -- and it was much easier than 
she expected. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of 15 amnesty applicants to earn permanent residency by passing a 
15-question exam, administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service at 
its Wilshire Boulevard office for phase two of its amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 immigrants applied for amnesty in the Los Angeles area under 
the first phase of the program from May, 1987, to May, 1988. In the second 
phase, these applicants must demonstrate a knowledge of English, civics and 
U.S. history in order to obtain permanent residency status. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said they expect 300,000 of the applicants to follow Quintero's 
lead by taking the multiple-choice exam at one of the 16 INS offices throughout 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Others may choose to prove their English proficiency by taking INS-approved 
classes at one of 300 schools in the area and thus would not have to take the 
test. Applicants younger than 16, or 65 years and older, are exempt, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Ezell, INS Western regional commissioner, said his staff is negotiating 
with religious and community groups in hopes that they will become licensed to 
administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be tough to find enough space for everyone to take the test, so 
we are hoping to get Catholic charities, local schools and other groups 
involved to help out," Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appointment Needed 
</P>
<P>
To take the test, immigrants must fill out an appointment card, available at 
all INS offices, and the agency will notify applicants of the time and date of 
their exam through the mail. Applicants have 18 months from the time of earning 
their temporary residency card to complete the second phase of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The test, to be given on Thursday nights starting Jan. 19, will be administered 
by videotape to groups of immigrants. Applicants must sign a statement at the 
top of the test that says they have studied at least 40 hours of English and 
U.S. history, and then they have to answer nine of the 15 questions correctly 
to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"If they fail the test the first time, they can take it as many times as they 
need to pass, free of charge," Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Pass It 
</P>
<P>
But if the applicants who took the test Wednesday are any indication, passing 
is not going to be a problem. Fifteen of the 16 test takers passed -- five with 
perfect scores. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so easy," said Quintero, who has taken night classes for the last year. 
"They asked questions that you hear every day, like, 'Who was the first 
President of the United States?' and 'Who can declare war in this country?' " 
</P>
<P>
Maria Lafarga and her husband, who both got perfect scores on the test, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how easy it was. I was so nervous when I came in here," said 
Lafarga, who hopes to work as a supermarket cashier. "I feel like a new 
person." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>

These are the centers in Los Angeles County where amnesty applicants can take 
the written exam. Applicants need an appointment before taking the test.

SUBURBS' POLITICAL CLOUT STACKS DECK AGAINST CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suburban political power has stacked the deck against attempts by urban 
lawmakers to oppose Gov. George Deukmejian's budget proposals to limit and 
reduce medical aid and welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
A clear example of that is Los Angeles County, where the state's biggest 
collection of suburbs -- most with conservative voting histories -- ring an 
urban area, the city of Los Angeles, where large numbers of poor who are 
dependent on aid payments and public hospitals and clinics are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
The numerical dominance of suburban lawmakers in the Legislature assumed new 
importance Wednesday as such Democratic urban legislators as Sens. David A. 
Roberti and Diane Watson of Los Angeles prepared to oppose the Republican 
governor's budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
They will do so in a long process in which many factors will play a part -- 
disputes between cities and counties; the power of Democratic leaders of the 
Senate and Assembly; the lame duck status of the governor, and even drug 
company lobbyists fighting Administration proposals to reduce Medi-Cal 
prescription drug payments. 
</P>
<P>
But two political scientists said the impact of suburban power on the budget 
process is a graphic illustration of how California's changing political 
demography -- with new suburbs overpowering old cities -- is affecting state 
policies and legislative politics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just one factor in a complex process," said Alan Heslop of the Rose 
Institute, a Claremont-McKenna College political think tank. But he said it is 
an important part in the playing out of the budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cain, a Caltech political scientist, said, "These suburban legislators 
reflect their constituents on issues." And these voters have been hostile in 
the past to more welfare spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I reject the idea they are selfish people," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden, 
(D-Santa Monica). "But they are skeptical. They are like K mart shoppers. They 
want to know what will be done with their tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County legislative delegation, largest in Sacramento, is 
dominated by senators and Assembly members from suburban areas by almost a 2-1 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to suburban power is the makeup of the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, which operates the state-federal-county financed welfare and 
health programs. Three of its five members are conservative suburbanites who 
have little enthusiasm for doing battle in Sacramento for welfare recipients. 
That makes it unlikely that the Sacramento delegation will get sharp prodding 
from the County Hall of Administration in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cain said that population growth in the county from the middle class on up has 
been in the suburbs, and these are the people most likely to vote. Urban 
population growth has been from the poor, for the most part, who tend to vote 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Although Republican registration is increasing in suburban areas, party lines 
are not always determining factors on such cutting-edge issues as welfare. 
Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda represents a prosperous 
middle-class San Fernando Valley district around Cal State Northridge where 
Democrats hold a registration lead of about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
But they are not especially loyal to a party identified with liberal policies 
such as the Great Society, generous welfare payments and civil rights 
legislation. While Democratic U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston received 53% of the Katz 
district vote in 1986, President Reagan, who rose to fame as a welfare critic, 
overwhelmingly carried the area when he was reelected in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Democrat Katz, while a close ally of liberal Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown, is cautious in discussing the budget. Asked about the health and welfare 
parts of the budget, he said, "I don't know yet." Keenly aware of the concerns 
of his constituents, he said, "I have to find out why Cal State Northridge 
didn't get some of the buildings it was supposed to get." 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the growth of conservative suburban political power in the 
Legislature would have been even greater if it had not been for Democratic 
reapportionments of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can look at the statewide electorate and not be impressed by its 
conservative, anti-tax bias," Heslop said. "The presidential election, the 
gubernatorial election, the last Senate election (Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's 
reelection) put a different cast on the state than the legislative and 
congressional elections." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Control by Democrats 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the fact that Democrats maintained control of the Legislature 
and of the congressional delegation, whose districts were also drawn by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The political arithmetic is expected to force the liberal Democratic leadership 
in the Senate and Assembly to wage their fight against the Deukmejian cuts in 
subtle, intricate ways. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Katz noted that Speaker Brown has put a large number of urban 
Democrats on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, that house's budget-writing 
body. "The committee has enough urban folks so that the urban areas are 
represented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, it takes a two-thirds majority of the 80-member Assembly and 40-member 
Senate to pass a budget, where most bills require only a simple majority. That 
ability to deny a two-thirds edge enhances the power of the outnumbered 
urbanites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Force Concessions 
</P>
<P>
With that leverage, Katz said, liberals could force concessions from Deukmejian 
and legislative Republicans. In exchange for going along with his proposal to 
deny cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients, Katz said, liberals could 
demand strong support from him and the conservative Republican lawmakers for 
repealing the Gann limit on state spending. Deukmejian has already said he is 
willing to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
But political scientist Cain said the conservative constituencies of Democrats 
such as Katz limit the ability of liberals such as Speaker Brown to fight 
Deukmejian. Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers fear too liberal of a 
leadership, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the leaders) have to deal internally with these divisions (between urban 
and suburban Democrats) because part of the price of staying in power is having 
a homogenous caucus," Cain said. "Underlying (the debate over) these cuts are 
the fundamental values that divide them (Democrats)."

PLAN TO CUT OFF CLINICS' FUNDS CALLED ILLOGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling on the hot line was a tearful, stammering 15-year-old girl with 
gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
She was coaxed into visiting T.H.E. Clinic for Women in Los Angeles, where she 
had a medical exam and was given antibiotics to cure her condition. She also 
got her first birth control device. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was one of more than 500,000 young females statewide who last 
year visited hundreds of state-supported family planning clinics that are 
scheduled to lose their funding in July under Gov. George Deukmejian's newly 
proposed state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Health care advocates denounced the governor's plan Wednesday. They defended 
the state's expenditure of $36.2 million -- by far the largest source of 
support for family planning services -- as one of the state health department's 
most cost-effective programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd gotten past this kind of illogical cutting of programs that are 
so cost-effective," said Sylvia Drew Ivie, executive director of T.H.E. Clinic 
on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in the Crenshaw area. 
</P>
<P>
Her clinic receives about $300,000 a year in state family planning funds to pay 
for birth control supplies, exams, counseling and testing for sexually 
transmitted diseases in more than 3,000 low-income females, who are mostly 
Asian, black and Latino. None of these state funds may be used for abortions, 
although some clinics do provide abortion referrals. 
</P>
<P>
"We save the taxpayers an enormous amount of money by helping women prevent 
unwanted births through birth control," Ivie said. 
</P>
<P>
Without the state funds, she said, services at T.H.E. Clinic, founded in 1972, 
would be "devastated." Statewide, these cuts will cause "more unwanted 
pregnancies, less prenatal care and a higher infant mortality rate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood officials in Sacramento said that it has been shown that $6 
in medical care and social services is saved for every $1 spent on family 
planning services, according to a study by the Institute for Health Policy 
Studies at the University of California. Planned Parenthood's 90 clinics 
statewide receive about a quarter of the state's family planning funds, 
spokesman David Alois said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government also funds family planning services, amounting to $12.5 
million in the state last year. That funding is expected to continue, but would 
probably be stretched so thin that drastic cuts would undoubtedly have to be 
made in innovative programs such as the one at T.H.E. Clinic targeting pregnant 
teens and adolescent boys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal, State Money 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, about $9.4 million in state money and $4 million in 
federal funds support 90 family planning clinics. Half are run by nonprofit 
groups and the rest are public clinics located in county facilities, said Tom 
Kraing, director of the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council, which 
distributes both the federal and state money. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that many excellent nonprofit clinics would be forced to close, 
including perhaps T.H.E. Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Ivie described the clinic's family planning funds as "the core of . . . our 
financial strength." Cuts in these services, she said, would jeopardize the 
viability of the whole clinic, including its other services -- prenatal care 
for hundreds of pregnant women, AIDS testing, nutritional programs, free 
immunization of children as well as free breast examinations and pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislative Action 
</P>
<P>
To eliminate $36.2 million in family planning funding, the Legislature must 
repeal legislation that set up and funded the state health department's office 
of family planning. If the Legislature refuses to do so, Deukmejian has said 
that he will gut the program by slashing its budget by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not wish to have to make any of these reductions," Deukmejian said 
Tuesday. "But if the Legislature does not support such actions, I fear that the 
alternative will be much worse." He threatened to slash other programs, 
including those for local mental health, Alzheimer's disease research, senior 
nutrition and alcohol and drug treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
The matter will be debated during the next six months. Meantime, a spokesman 
for the state Health Services Department said, grant applications for family 
planning funds will be accepted and evaluated.

MURDER SUSPECT FACES MENTAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge has appointed a psychiatrist to determine the mental competency of the 
man charged with fatally shooting two Universal Studios security guards, saying 
he believed they were Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Florence Bernstein ordered the psychiatrist to prepare his 
report on the defendant, Nathan Trupp, for a Feb. 7 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If found to be mentally unable to understand the nature of the legal 
proceedings, Trupp will be placed in a state mental hospital until he is found 
competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp is also accused of shooting to death three people in Albuquerque, N.M., 
days before the Dec. 1 shootings in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Trupp shot the two security guards while stalking actor 
Michael Landon.

2 GROUPS GET OK TO DON LAPD UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to permit off-duty and retired 
police officers to wear their LAPD uniforms during crowd and traffic control at 
filming locations. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to grant the off-duty and retired officers authority to 
direct traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Both votes brought the city into compliance with a new state law requiring 
off-duty officers who moonlight as private security personnel to wear their 
city-issued police uniform. The state law required each city to specifically 
authorize the off-duty activity as well as establish rules governing it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state law did not address the issue of retired officers, city 
officials decided that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates will decide which retired 
officer may wear the LAPD uniform while at filming locations. Any retired 
officer would be required to wear a special badge indicating he is retired.

MANSION WILL BE MOVED, CONVERTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 102-year-old Strong House, a historic landmark threatened with demolition 
because it is in the path of a Convention Center expansion project, will be 
moved to the MacArthur Park area and rehabilitated with a $550,000, 
low-interest loan from the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA board Wednesday approved the loan to the nonprofit Los Angeles Family 
Housing Corp., which plans to convert the mansion into six apartments for 
people with very low incomes, CRA spokesman Marc Littman said. The building is 
to be moved 2 miles from its downtown site to a city-owned lot on Coronado 
Street near Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The move, by flat-bed truck, is expected to take place by the end of next month 
so the $390-million Convention Center project can begin on schedule in March. 
The rehabilitation and conversion work on the house is expected to be finished 
by early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The once-elegant, three-story Victorian house, last used as a 27-unit apartment 
building, was built in 1887 and first occupied by a salesman named Edward 
Strong. It was declared a city historic landmark in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA plans to sell or lease the house to the Family Housing Corp., Littman 
said.

FUNDS FOR CARE OF ECCLESIA YOUTHS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oregon legislative subcommittee has agreed to appropriate $500,000 to pay 
the state's cost of caring for the 53 children removed from the Watts-based 
Ecclesia Athletic Assn. camp in October. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee of the Legislative Emergency Board made the recommendation 
after being told by the state Department of Justice that there was little 
chance of getting the money from the children's families. 
</P>
<P>
The 53 children have been in state custody since Oct. 14 after the death of 
Dayna Broussard, 8, the daughter of Ecclesia founder Eldridge Broussard Jr. The 
children have been kept at the Hillcrest School for Girls, the MacLaren School 
for Boys and with foster families.

THAIS PLAN LOGGING BAN TO CUT FLOODING

The Thai Cabinet has approved a nationwide ban on logging, which was blamed for 
aggravating November floods that killed more than 350 people, a Thai official 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Floods fed by heavy rain caused havoc in 12 southern provinces. In the 
worst-hit area, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many people were killed when mud, logs 
and trees cascaded down barren hillsides and buried entire villlages. 
</P>
<P>
The ban would end the 301 logging concessions awarded nationwide. It is 
expected to take effect when Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and King 
Bhumibol Adulyadej sign it within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Choonhavan says Thailand's need for wood products can be met by imports.

JIM MURRAY: IN MODERN GOLF, YOU CAN'T THROW OUT THE FIRST-ROUND LEADERS

<P>
The early rounds of a 5-round golf tournament are like the first few rounds of 
a heavyweight championship fight. A lot of clinching, jabbing, shoving, 
bobbing, weaving. A reluctance to close with your opponent, to wake him up, to 
dare him. You don't throw any crazy rights, you don't go for the quick 
knockout, you protect yourself at all times. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you make birdie if you can, but you don't risk a double bogey to do it. You 
tend to take the high-percentage way around the course. You hit for the fat 
part of the green, away from the water, around, not through, trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But even in this heyday of no-star golf, you would think the doings of one or 
two key players would filter through the clubhouse or press room the way they 
used to. It was not so long ago that, even in a sorting-out first round, the 
buzz would go through a club: "What is Hogan doing?" Or, "Anybody hear a score 
on Snead?" 
</P>
<P>
A golf tournament was not under way until a Palmer watch had been set up. Or a 
Nicklaus or Trevino information network had been established. And then, 
latterly, no golf gallery would go a hole without checking, "Has Raymond 
(Floyd) gone off yet?" or, "What hole is Greg (Norman) on?" 
</P>
<P>
You had to see what Johnny Miller was up to before you could write your lead in 
the press tent. Johnny might cobble it up for you by coming in with a 61 late 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament golf has become such a crapshoot, you don't hear that anymore. A 
golf field is like a claiming race at Caliente. You stick a pin in a program. 
You don't really see how any of them can win it. I mean, nobody hurries over to 
a leader board to see if Shawn McEntee or Brian Tennyson is making a run at the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
One consequence is, you no longer throw out the unknown first-round leaders. 
The attitude used to be of no-names atop the leader board: "Very cute. But you 
don't belong there. Wait till Saturday night. Order will be restored." 
</P>
<P>
There were, at last count, 11 first-time winners on the PGA Tour last year. 
It's not a tour, it's a lottery. It probably has less form than anything in the 
whole firmament of sport at the moment. The ribbon clerks don't get scared out 
of this pot. They see and raise. 
</P>
<P>
They've got a whole lot of U.S. Open winners in this field at the Bob Hope 
Chrysler Classic this week. They've got a couple of British Open winners. It's 
awash with former Masters winners. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody's in a hurry to bet any of them. 
</P>
<P>
When Andy Warhol said that everybody in the United States was going to be 
famous for 15 minutes, he must have had the PGA Tour in mind. It's the world's 
biggest Alphonse-Gaston act. So nobody was yawning when word filtered down 
early that a young nobody named David Ogrin was leading the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The good news about David Ogrin was that he had never won a PGA tournament. 
Which makes him practically an "out" price to win here, the way things have 
been going on the tour. Besides, he has only been on the Tour 7 years. What is 
he, a machine? 
</P>
<P>
David is about as average as you can get in today's golf. Naturally, he's 
blond. Plays out of Texas but comes from Illinois. So he lives and dies with 
the Chicago Cubs, a la Raymond Floyd. Ogrin's greatest fear is not a ball in 
the water in a playoff but that a player the Cubs traded to Texas will suddenly 
hit .380 next year. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogrin is not leading this tournament, but his opening 68 on a windy, 
blustery day at Bermuda Dunes puts him squarely in position. 
</P>
<P>
David has no illusions about being the next Ben Hogan. He knows he has a better 
chance of being the next Ben Franklin. He knows where he fits. 
</P>
<P>
"I make $138,000 on the tour and everybody comes up and says, 'Great year!' " 
he says. "Bob Tway makes $368,000 and everybody comes up and says 'What's wrong 
with Bob Tway?' " 
</P>
<P>
For a non-winner on the tour, Ogrin became a minor celebrity in his first year 
in the game when a golf magazine printed his rookie's diary. 
</P>
<P>
"I dumped all over Las Vegas," he admits, only somewhat ruefully. "The town, 
not the golf course. Then, I blasted on Memphis. The golf course, not the town. 
Then, I almost won my first tournament at Memphis. I finished second in 1985. I 
lost a playoff to Hal Sutton." 
</P>
<P>
His candor cost him $1,000, the fine levied for "shedding unfavorable light on 
the players and the sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Ogrin: "The old-timers would admit, 'What Ogrin says is true. But I 
would never say it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ogrin is not only more careful with what he says but how he plays. His game is 
patience, he says, but he is satisfied with his progress up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with my 6 years. Golf is a game which can't be rushed." 
</P>
<P>
No one can accuse David Ogrin of rushing it. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to a course year after year is like going back to old friends," he 
says. "You get more comfortable each time." 
</P>
<P>
He also likes to point out that he made the cut -- shot well enough to stay in 
the tournament from start to finish -- 20 times last year. This is a long way 
from Byron Nelson's 113 straight cuts or Jack Nicklaus' 105. His game, of 
course, may always stay well short of Nicklaus' or Nelson's. It may not even 
catch up with Joey Sindelar's. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, he has to catch up with leader Fred Couples here this week. And 
then get to the point where, some year, he will rack up a half-million or so in 
a year's earnings and have someone come up and say, "What's wrong with David 
Ogrin?"

MANNING IS OUT FOR REST OF THE SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
TORN LIGAMENT MAY CAUSE HIM TO MISS 1989-90, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Danny Manning will require major reconstructive knee surgery that will sideline 
him for the rest of this season and possibly all of next, Clipper team 
physician Dr. Tony Daly announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Daly confirmed speculation that, during the first quarter of last Wednesday's 
game at Milwaukee, Manning completely tore the anterior cruciate ligament in 
his right knee, one of the worst injuries a basketball player can suffer. Daly 
had said previously that the rookie star suffered some damage to the knee and, 
more recently, said that he was 95% sure the ligament was torn. 
</P>
<P>
"If all goes extremely well, he could be ready at the start of next season," 
Daly said before Wednesday night's loss to Sacramento at the Sports Arena. 
"Realistically, the general consensus is that it takes 1 year." 
</P>
<P>
But could Manning also miss the entire 1989-90 season with rehabilitation that 
has been known to take 18 months? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a possibility," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
Is there also a possibility that Manning will never play again? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there is. He could get a stiff knee out of it all. . . . But the 
odds are that he'll be back. Will he come back at 100%? That's the part we're 
unsure about." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the diagnosis of his team doctor, Clipper owner Donald Sterling said of 
Manning's status: "I want to reserve comment until after the definitive tests 
are performed." 
</P>
<P>
But Manning and agent Ron Grinker, satisfied with a pair of computer-enhanced 
X-rays taken Friday and Tuesday, said there will be no more tests. They said 
the operation will take place within a week, but since they have decided 
against having Daly perform it, they first need to select a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Grinker said five or six doctors across the nation are being considered. It is 
known that Manning met Wednesday with Robert Kerlan, a prominent Inglewood 
physician, who asked him to return Friday for a re-evaluation. But Manning may 
leave Southern California for the surgery and subsequent rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said at a halftime news conference: "The night after the game, I knew 
it was a little more than a hyperextension (as originally diagnosed). But it's 
something that happened, and I can't go back in time, so I have to prepare for 
the future. The future for me is surgery and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get it done as soon as possible. The sooner the surgery is done, the 
sooner the leg will heal, the sooner I can begin rehabilitation and get back to 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a chance I will come back and might not be the same player. But 
those are the cards I was dealt, so I have to go from there. I can't stand up 
here and cry about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play basketball again, but I just don't know at what level. I will walk 
again, and that's the most important part." 
</P>
<P>
The operation, a procedure that can last from 1 to 2 hours, involves taking a 
tendon from the leg and putting it where the damaged ligament used to be. The 
tendon will be attached to the knee and eventually will act as the new 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
The anterior cruciate ligament, which on the right leg runs in a diagonal from 
the shinbone to the back of the thighbone, keeps the leg from flexing forward 
beyond a straight leg. Because of the constant stopping, starting and turning 
on a hard floor, the joint takes a severe pounding in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's injury is the same one that sidelined, among others, Steve Kerr, then 
at the University of Arizona and now with the Phoenix Suns; Bernard King, then 
of the New York Knicks and now with the Washington Bullets; Mitch Kupchak, then 
with the Lakers and now the team's assistant general manager; former Clipper 
Michael Brooks; Eddie Lee Wilkins of the Knicks, and Archie Marshall, Manning's 
friend and teammate last season on Kansas' NCAA championship team, who is now 
out of basketball. Kupchak, Kerr and Marshall suffered additional damage to 
their knees. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, 23, the Clippers' No. 1 draft pick, who missed the first 4 games of 
the season because of a contract holdout, was averaging 16.7 points and 6.6 
rebounds. Having emerged as one of the leading candidates for rookie of the 
year, he was already an integral part of the Clippers and was regarded as the 
foundation of the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
Without him, the immediate future, at least, looks bleak. Since his injury, the 
Clippers have lost 4 games by an average of 26.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on a slam dunk 
just before the 1985-86 season. Kupchak injured his left knee 26 games into the 
1981-82 season and, likewise, had major reconstructive surgery and lengthy 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Now they empathize with Manning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have quite a bit of compassion for him," Kupchak said. "At first, you think 
about his ordeal. Then you think about the Clippers being snakebitten again. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to L.A. (in 1981), and midway through my first season, I went down. Now 
it's his first season in L.A., and he goes down. It's certainly not the way 
anybody would have planned it, but I certainly know what he's going through. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the joints in a basketball player's body, the knee and the ankle 
are the most important. The knee goes through some very unusual movements in 
basketball. If you were to do a slow-motion picture of the leg up close in a 
game, what it does to the knee is hard to believe, with all the turning and 
stopping after a full sprint. 
</P>
<P>
"If he gets a good, tight repair and disciplines himself real hard during 
rehabilitation, he should be able to come back in some form." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, who has rejoined the Knicks, said: "It was real frightening. My year 
and my career could have been ending, and at the time, I didn't have a 
contract. Dr. (Norman) Scott (the Knicks' team physician) told me there was a 
good chance I would never play again. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have got to want to come back. This injury is very 
career-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said his rehabilitation took 1 1/2 years. Now he said he is "better 
than before, because I probably work my legs harder than before the operation." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins had some advice for Manning: "I'd tell him that he has an example out 
there that you can come back from this surgery. Then I'd tell him it will take 
a total effort with a lot of pain and a lot of time. It's not going to happen 
overnight. It may take a year, it may take 2 years, but he can make it back."

MORNING BRIEFING: PEOPLE ASKING WRONG REID FOR NBA ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people are assuming that 6-foot 11-inch All-American forward J.R. Reid of 
North Carolina will forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and make 
himself available in the National Basketball Assn. draft this year. 
</P>
<P>
Reid has been asked over and over about it, but Anthony Cotton of the 
Washington Post says the questions have been directed at the wrong person. The 
opinion of Reid's father, Herman, a former NFL player for the Baltimore Colts 
and now a schoolteacher in Virginia Beach, Va., figures to carry plenty of 
weight when the decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
"In our family, we push education. We don't talk about pro ball," Herman Reid 
said. "As parents, you want your son to stay in school for 4 years. Right now, 
if we have anything to do with it, he will. His family isn't rich, but he's got 
nice things. We want him to enjoy college." 
</P>
<P>
Says J.R., "I can't recall the last time I did anything without his consent." 
</P>
<P>
Add Reid: "I remember when it was time to pick a college," J.R. said. "Maryland 
was the first place I visited and when I got back I wanted to go there. My mom 
said to wait, and sure enough I decided that Carolina would be better for me. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget that about college athletes. I'm only 20 years old. I'm young, 
still learning about life. I've watched others and learned and benefited from 
their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBA's been there a long time, I'm sure it'll be there without me for 
another year." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky of the Kings probably is still the best all-around player in the 
National Hockey League, but Mario Lemieux may lead the league in intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Said goalie Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders after Lemieux had scored 3 
goals to lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 5-3 victory Tuesday night: "There 
has to be something involved with the height of the man (6 feet 4 inches) and 
the weight behind the shot (200 pounds), because when he one-times a shot, when 
he gets all of it . . . I'm not going to concede a goal, but it's the next best 
thing to a sure one." 
</P>
<P>
A reference Wednesday to Cazzie Russell being the last Laker to wear No. 32 
before Magic Johnson arrived was a digit off. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, who played on the 1974-75 Laker team that had lost 8 straight road 
games, was the last Laker to wear No. 33 before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar arrived the 
next season. Bill Bridges wore No. 32 on that '74-'75 team.

NCAA TAKES TOUGHER STANCE ON PROPOSITION 48; 
</P>
<P>
NEW LEGISLATION WILL ELIMINATE POTENTIAL SCHOLARSHIPS FOR PARTIAL QUALIFIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
College coaches will no longer be able to give athletic scholarships to 
freshman who do not meet the academic requirements of Proposition 48, according 
to a proposal adopted Wednesday by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule eliminates so-called partial qualifiers, prospects who achieve an 
overall grade-point average of 2.0 but fail to meet the minimum grade-point 
average in college preparatory courses or do not achieve the minimum required 
score on standardized entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
An NCAA spokesman said that about 1,800 athletes in the last 3 years would have 
been affected by the rule, which will be implemented in the 1990-91 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula Walsh, director of research for the NCAA, said by phone from Mission, 
Kan., that NCAA schools have given scholarships to about 600 partial qualifiers 
each year since the implementation of Proposition 48, which established minimum 
academic standards for freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Under current legislation, partial qualifiers can be awarded full scholarships 
but must sit out their freshman year, neither playing nor practicing while 
losing a year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
When the new rule is implemented, they will still have to sit out while losing 
a year of eligibility, but will also have to pay their own ways. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt of Vanderbilt said the rule would send "a clear and 
unambiguous message" to high school athletes. "And that is, there is no 
substitute for diligence and study in their chosen field of education." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fred Jacoby, commissioner of the Southwest Conference: "I think there was 
a feeling that some students really shouldn't be in college. By that, I mean 
those that are not academically qualified." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, introduced by the Southeastern Conference, passed by a vote of 
163-154 after being rejected Tuesday, 159-151. 
</P>
<P>
It was opposed by black educators, who believe that standardized entrance exams 
are racially discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Al Avant of Chicago State called Proposition 48 a failure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just an attempt by the NCAA to look good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of predominantly black schools, however, chose not to speak 
against the proposal Wednesday on the convention floor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some battles that are perhaps better left alone for a while," said 
E. M. Jones, Grambling State faculty representative. "I think that the partial 
qualifier ought to have access, as a non-qualifier ought to have access. To 
deny access to anyone is just simply wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) Sometimes I simply become tired of going forth and trying to fight the 
battle. And right now I'm trying to regroup or hope that some of the members 
will get some degree of backbone and decide that the education of the student 
is most important. 
</P>
<P>
"The conscience of some of these people is going to have to change. They're 
going to have to start seeing these (Proposition 48 non-qualifiers) as they 
would see their own children." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Charles Theokas of Temple argued that proponents of the 
measure were more concerned about rivals gaining a competitive edge than they 
were about the well-being of the athletes who would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some very selfish motives," an emotional Theokas told delegates 
before Wednesday's vote was taken. "If this passes, the entire concept of not 
being punitive with (Proposition 48) is out the window. Now we're saying, 
'Let's not even talk to these people.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alan Williams, faculty representative at Virginia and chairman of the NCAA 
infractions committee, made the request to reconsider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming group of students seem to be much, much better prepared for 
college than they used to be because of Proposition 48," Williams said. "But 
there seems to be a persistent group of people who do not take academics 
seriously because they felt they had a way out through the partial-qualifier 
provision. That's the group we were looking at." 
</P>
<P>
Most non-qualifiers will wind up in junior colleges, Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not really depriving them," Jacoby said. "You're just sort of steering 
them onto a different route for the first 2 years."

A proposal to establish a season-opening college football game each year at 
Anaheim Stadium was approved Wednesday by the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. at its convention. 
</P>
<P>
The first Disneyland Pigskin Classic will be played in August 1990, said Tom 
Starr, executive director of the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Schools will be allowed to play in the game not more than once every 5 years 
and each of the country's 7 major conferences must be represented once every 7 
years. The same guidelines are followed by the Kickoff Classic, which is played 
each August at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The major beneficiary of both games is a retirement trust fund for the American 
Football Coaches Assn. JERRY CROWE

REPORT OF LAKER TRADE FOR CENTER DENIED BY WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, denied a report that the club is 
considering trading forward Orlando Woolridge, or other players or draft picks, 
to the Indiana Pacers for center Herb Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," West said Wednesday. "I haven't even talked with (Indiana 
officials) about that. Donnie Walsh, Indiana's general manager, and George 
Irvine, another Pacer executive, have followed the Lakers the last 2 games. 
They had attempted to hire Laker assistant coach Randy Pfund as new Pacer coach 
Dick Versace's top assistant. Pfund turned down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 30, averaging 12.6 points and 8.7 rebounds a game going into 
Wednesday night's Pacer game at Boston, is earning $983,000 this season, part 
of a long-term contract. Woolridge reportedly is making $500,000, meaning that 
the Lakers would face salary-cap problems if they went after Williams. SAM

NEWSWIRE: WINFIELD ACCUSED OF MAKING LOANS TO GAMBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees informed the baseball commissioner's office in 1987 that 
Dave Winfield allegedly made loans to a gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Levin, a spokesman for Peter Ueberroth, confirmed that the commissioner's 
office was aware of the charges after two sources told the Associated Press 
that the Yankees had made the information available. "The office of the 
commissioner has been aware of the charges raised by the New York Yankees about 
the possible involvement of Dave Winfield with an individual who allegedly has 
participated in sports betting," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
"To date, evidence has not been presented or uncovered which would warrant 
commissioner action. We will continue to investigate the matter, taking into 
account any information which may arise out of the current litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield and the David M. Winfield Foundation sued Yankee Owner George 
Steinbrenner Friday, charging him with failing to make $450,000 in payments to 
the foundation, as required by Winfield's contract. Ken Warner, a lawyer for 
Steinbrenner, said the $450,000 had been placed in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner countersued Winfield and the foundation on Monday, charging misuse 
of funds and alleging that Winfield failed to make $380,000 in payments to the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's lawsuit included allegations by Howard Spira, 29, of New York, 
who said that Winfield agreed to lend him $6,000 in 1981 with the understanding 
that he would pay back $8,000 a week later. Spira said that Winfield knew at 
the time that the money was to be used to pay gambling debts. 
</P>
<P>
Spira also said that Winfield had lent him $15,000 on another occasion, with 
the understanding that Spira would pay back $18,500 within 2 or 3 weeks. Spira 
accused Winfield of threatening his life when he did not repay the money and 
said that he went into hiding for a year before settling his debt. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Klein, a lawyer for Winfield, said the outfielder was unaware that Spira 
was associated with gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Rule 21 of the Professional Baseball Rules, which is posted in all clubhouses, 
states penalties for players who bet on games, but it does not have any 
specific provisions for associating with gamblers.

Stacey Augmon scored 18 points, including 4 in the final 3 minutes, and 
11th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas got past Fresno State, 83-77, Wednesday night in a 
Big West Conference game at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon rebounded his own missed shot and scored with 2:44 left to give UNLV 
(11-2 overall, 6-0 in the Big West) a 75-74 lead. Moses Scurry stole a Fresno 
State pass and scored on a layup 23 seconds later to make it a 3-point Rebel 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, which trailed most of the game, was behind, 41-37, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Jervis Cole scored 26 points for Fresno State (7-5, 2-1), including 2 free 
throws that gave the Bulldogs a 74-73 lead with 3:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Anthony added 16 points for UNLV; David Butler had 15 and Anderson Hunt 
14. Freshman Wilbert Hooker came off the bench to score 14 points for Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV took a 20-12 lead, but Fresno bounced back to go in front, 38-30, behind 
Cole, who scored 12 of his 16 first-half points during the 8-minute run. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 88, Maryland 72 -- Kevin Madden scored 25 points, and Rick Fox 
had 18 to help the eighth-ranked Tar Heels overcome the Terrapins in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Reid, still playing as a reserve since his return to action from foot 
surgery, added 17 points as North Carolina (14-2) built a 46-35 halftime lead 
and coasted to victory in its ACC opener. 
</P>
<P>
Jerrod Mustaf scored 18 points for Maryland (6-8, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 76, Pitt 57 -- Charles Smith scored 19 points, and the 
seventh-ranked Hoyas held the Panthers to 19 points in the first half of a Big 
East game at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt (7-6, 1-2) made only 7 of 23 shots in the first half and committed 14 
turnovers. It marked the first time that the Panthers have lost two straight 
games under Coach Paul Evans, who took over the team in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
John Turner added 18 points for Georgetown (11-1, 1-1), which is 7-0 against 
Pitt at the Capital Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 75, South Carolina 52 -- Pervis Ellison scored 11 of his 13 points 
in the second half, and the ninth-ranked Cardinals trounced the Gamecocks in a 
Metro Conference opener at Louisville for their 11th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina (8-3) was within 48-43 when James Brewer's short jump shot with 
8:41 left ignited a 15-2 run that gave the Cardinals a 63-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (11-2) held the Gamecocks to 9 points in the last 9:28 with its 
pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 100, LSU 96 -- Ian Lockhart twice tipped in missed free throws in the 
last 90 seconds, and the No. 17 Volunteers slipped past the Tigers in a 
Southeastern Conference game at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (11-1, 4-0) had a 14-point lead in the first half but had to make 7 
of 9 free throws in the final minutes to hold on. Lockhart tipped in the 2 
misses. 
</P>
<P>
Dyron Nix had 20 points for the Volunteers despite sitting out nearly 13 
minutes of the second half with 4 fouls, and Lockhart added 19 points. Chris 
Jackson scored 26 points for LSU (9-5, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 74, Iona 58 -- The 13th-ranked Pirates turned around a 10-point 
deficit with 17 straight points and defeated the Gaels at White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Iona (6-8) took a 13-3 lead in the first 6 minutes before Seton Hall (14-1) 
rallied. Frantz Volcy scored 6 points in the run as the Pirates held the Gaels 
scoreless for 5:36 during their streak. John Morton scored 18 points for the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 100, William &amp; Mary 38 -- The top-ranked Blue Devils forced the Tribe 
into 27 turnovers and scored their most one-sided victory in 35 years at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary (2-10) also was the victim in 1954 when Duke won, 109-44. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Laettner scored 13 points for Duke (12-0). 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 85, Jacksonville 70 -- George McCloud scored 35 points, including 
6 3-pointers, and the No. 14 Seminoles downed the Dolphins at Jacksonville, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (11-1) is off to its best start since winning 11 of its first 12 
in the 1979-80 season, when the Seminoles went 22-9. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Taylor scored 15 points for Jacksonville (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 88, Virginia 70 -- Eldon Campbell had 20 points, and the Deacons 
outscored the Cavaliers, 18-3, to start the second half in an ACC game at 
Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 55-27, with 14:38 left, Virginia (7-6, 0-2) made a run to

LOYOLA USES DEFENSE TO DEFEAT USF, 113-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Coast Athletic Conference play opened Wednesday, and the University of San 
Francisco tried to hold Loyola Marymount to a moderate pace. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Lions introduced a new wrinkle: A tough defense to go with its vaunted 
offense. The result was a 113-95 victory over the Dons before a crowd of 3,286 
at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' pressure defense helped them overcome an early deficit and win their 
16th consecutive regular-season conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is 7-5 overall, USF 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers led Loyola with 36 points. Enoch Simmons scored 20 and Jeff Fryer 
17, including 2 3-pointers late in the game that helped put it away. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Joel DeBortoli led USF with 30 points, including 21 in the second half, 
but star center Mark McCathrion had a subpar 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the pace of the game, especially the first 8 or 9 minutes," 
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "We had to do it off our defense. Pressure 
defense makes sure we get enough (offensive) runs. When you press, you 
neutralize the star (McCathrion)." 
</P>
<P>
USF was coming off an upset of Notre Dame in which it turned the ball over only 
8 times. The Lions forced 25 turnovers, 15 after halftime. They outscored USF, 
64-56, in the second half, a margin more to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pressure bothered us, no question about it," Don Coach Jim Brovelli 
said. "We made a little run, then they hit the 3-pointers that put it away. 
They forced us to make the mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
USF had control for much of the first half. Loyola lost a 20-13 lead as the 
Dons went ahead, 25-24, on Scott McWhorter's 18-foot jumper. McWhorter's 
rebound shot made it 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to stimulate the Lions, whose press began to force turnovers and 
produce fast-break baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Paced by Gathers and Simmons, the Lions went on a 17-6 run to gain a 43-33 lead 
with 1:39 left in the half. Simmons had 10 points in the span. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions maintained the double-figure lead at halftime, 49-39, a relatively 
modest output for them. Gathers had 16 points and Simmons 13. 
</P>
<P>
But the tempo picked up in the second half behind Loyola's defense. The Lions 
opened the half with a 14-8 run and were ahead, 63-47, just 4 minutes into the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The lead increased to 85-63 as Loyola began connecting on 3-point shots -- with 
6 after halftime -- and the Dons continued to make turnovers. Loyola broke 100 
points with 2:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for an opener," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions play host to Santa Clara at 7:30 tonight in a matchup of two 
conference favorites.

WAVES ABLE TO HOLD OFF BRONCOS FOR 72-63 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presence of old enemy Santa Clara brought out the best -- and the beast -- 
in Pepperdine Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, playing much more aggressively and shooting a little better than 
they have all season, moved out to an early 17-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But old enemies die hard. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara made the game close in the second half, but Pepperdine finally 
escaped with a 72-63 victory before 1,766 fans at Firestone Fieldhouse in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In winning their West Coast Athletic Conference opener, the Waves improved to 
9-7 overall. Santa Clara fell to 11-3 and 0-1 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, overplaying on defense, came up with several steals early in the 
first half. As a result, the Broncos weren't getting many shots, while the 
Waves were making theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves shot 46.4% in the first half. Going into the game, Pepperdine was 
shooting 44.1%. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind by as many as 13 points in the first half, however, the 
Broncos came back strong. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pepperdine's turn to get rattled, and Santa Clara took advantage of Wave 
lapses, twice cutting the lead to 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-point shot by LaCoby Phillips narrowed the margin to 52-50 at 7:12. About 5 
minutes later, Phillips made 1 of 2 free throws, and Santa Clara closed within, 
63-61. 
</P>
<P>
But Dexter Howard, who led Pepperdine with 21 points, made a turn-around bank 
shot in the lane with 1:32 left, and Santa Clara was forced into fouling. The 
Waves made 9 of 10 free throws in the last 1 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lewis scored 17 points for the Waves. Santa Clara was led by Jeffty 
Connelly with 14 points; Phillips added 13 and Osei Appiah 12. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said there was a good reason why his team appeared 
to be so full of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"After a poor effort against Boise State (last Thursday night)," Asbury said, 
"we came out and had our best practice sessions of the season on Saturday, 
Sunday and Monday. And it showed this evening." 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Santa Clara came out flat, while Pepperdine was fired up. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves spurted to a 17-4 lead, ignited by 3-point shots by Marty Wilson, 
Craig Davis and Lewis. The 3-pointer by Wilson, a fifth-year senior guard, was 
the first of his career. 
</P>
<P>
But when Pepperdine began running out of gas, the Broncos filled their tank and 
took off. Jens Gordon hit 2 quick baskets to get Santa Clara started, cutting 
the lead to 20-12 with 8:58 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:47 left in the half, freshman guard Phillips tossed in a 15-foot jumper, 
and Santa Clara pulled within 23-20. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the basket by Phillips, Gordon picked up his third personal foul 
and left the game. That loosened up the Bronco defense a bit, and Davis made 2 
more 3-pointers, spurring the Waves to a 36-26 lead at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves will play host to the University of San Francisco at 7:30 tonight.

LEONARD-NUNN MATCHUP APPEARS TO BE IN THE CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless Frank Bruno shows up with Robin Givens on his arm in Las Vegas next 
month for his fight against Mike Tyson, boxing's 1989 blockbuster show could be 
Sugar Ray Leonard against Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
That appears to be what promoter Bob Arum has in mind for the middleweight 
division. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing at a New York news conference Tuesday that Nunn would fight Sumbu 
Kalambay in a middleweight unification bout March 25, Arum also said he was 
negotiating with Mike Trainer, Leonard's attorney, and Manny Steward, Thomas 
Hearns' manager, for a Leonard-Hearns bout in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
If Leonard-Hearns II is set up, the following probably would occur: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Nunn-Kalambay winner would become the International Boxing Federation 
and World Boxing Assn. champion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That winner would meet the winner of the Feb. 24 bout between Roberto Duran 
and Iran Barkley, the World Boxing Council champion, with the winner becoming 
the undisputed middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leonard and Hearns would fight in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, late next summer, the undisputed middleweight champion would meet 
the winner of Leonard-Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn would be a lopsided favorite all the way to a bout against Leonard or 
Hearns. And Leonard, off his impressive showing against Donny Lalonde in 
November, would be a big choice over Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, 25, possibly boxing's hottest young property next to Tyson, won the IBF 
middleweight title convincingly last July when he stopped previously unbeaten 
Frank Tate, largely on the strength of one body punch. Nunn defended it easily 
against Juan Roldan Nov. 3, knocking out the more experienced Roldan in the 
eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
The Kalambay bout will put Nunn into the million-dollar-purse class, and 
possibly on the way to a pay-per-view cable TV showdown with Leonard, should 
Arum bring Leonard and Hearns together. 
</P>
<P>
If that happens, Nunn could leap to an 8-digit payday with Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn (32-0) has boxed for the Ten Goose Boxing Club in North Hollywood since he 
turned pro in 1984. He grew up in Davenport, Iowa, where he was a nationally 
ranked amateur middleweight. Early in his pro career, the quick-footed Nunn was 
dismissed as a "runner" who was piling up decision victories over opponents who 
couldn't catch him. But the victories over Tate and Roldan, both of which were 
achieved with firepower as well as finesse, left no doubt that Nunn was 
suddenly the sport's dominant middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Leonard's camp, Trainer confirmed this week that negotiations are 
under way for Leonard-Hearns II. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob (Arum) came to see me Monday, put a proposal on my desk, and I've 
discussed it with Ray," Trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can reach an agreement with Bob that makes Ray happy, then, yes, Ray 
wants the fight. It's better than 50-50 it'll happen. . . . The level of 
interest among people who want to promote it is very high." 
</P>
<P>
What's proposed by Arum and at least one other promotional group, TitanSports, 
is a rematch of the memorable Caesars Palace battle the two had in 1981, when 
Leonard rallied from certain defeat to stop Hearns in the 14th round, when both 
were welterweights. 
</P>
<P>
TitanSports, parent company of the World Wrestling Federation, promoted 
Leonard-Lalonde. That promotion, according to sources, earned Leonard about $15 
million and Lalonde $5 million. Leonard's knockout of Lalonde in Las Vegas Nov. 
7 was his first appearance in a ring since he defeated Marvelous Marvin Hagler 
in April, 1987. Leonard's conditioning appeared to be superb, and if he had 
lost a significant measure of quickness or power from his prime, it wasn't 
clearly visible. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, however, seems to have fallen far from his peak years, the late 1970s 
and early 1980s. Off his last two performances -- a shocking knockout loss to 
Barkley and an unimpressive decision over James Kinchen -- he would be a 
decided underdog against Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns almost lost to Kinchen, and there were boos when he was awarded a split 
decision. Kinchen knocked Hearns on his wallet early in the fight and took 
Hearns' once-feared right-hand shots for 12 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns, 31, has a 46-3 record, and Leonard, 32, is 35-1. When they met in their 
classic 1981 battle, Leonard was 25 and Hearns nearly 23. At the time, it was 
the richest bout in history, generating between $30 million and $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
With boxing economics now geared toward pay-per-view revenue instead of 
closed-circuit telecasts, the two conceivably could generate more money the 
second time around, even with neither holding a championship. 
</P>
<P>
And so for two middleweights, at opposite ends of their careers, it seems that 
a beginning and an ending are at hand: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nunn, once dismissed as a quick-stepping slapper, seems on the verge of 
becoming one of boxing's highest-paid stars. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For Hearns, the painful 8-year wait may be over for a rematch with the man 
who broke his heart in a long-ago 14th round.

10 : TO-THE-DOOR GROCERS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS PROVIDE HOME DELIVERY OF FOOD ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether you depend on the service regularly or just use it once in a while, a 
market that delivers can be worth its weight in groceries. Those in the 
Southland range widely in size, specialties and business policies. 
</P>
<P>
The following information was compiled through interviews with each market but 
doesn't tell the whole story. It would be best to visit the store you plan to 
use, and check the scope of items available, prices and the quality you can 
expect to receive. If it's physically impossible to go to the market, place a 
minimum (or small) order that provides a sampling of fresh produce and meat, 
poultry or fish. 
</P>
<P>
All of these markets stress personal service, but find out about their other 
specialties. Some pride themselves on their meats, others tout their fish or 
produce. Ask about items they carry exclusively. Prices vary, but don't expect 
to find any discounting. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to prevent any later misunderstandings, discuss with a person in 
authority: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What delivery charge, if any, there will be to your exact address. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Double check the hours and days of the week that telephone orders are 
accepted and how long it will take to receive the groceries once you've placed 
an order. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Find out if the vehicle used to make the delivery is equipped with 
refrigeration. If not, will the groceries reach you quickly enough to still be 
in optimum condition? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arrange how payment will be made. Some stores accept nationally recognized 
credit cards or personal checks. Others invite in-house charge accounts and 
bill monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Market -- 608 E. Balboa Blvd., Balboa, (714) 673-8310. Orders of any 
size and amount will be delivered without a service charge. Call from 8 a.m. to 
10 p.m., and delivery can usually be made within two hours to anywhere in the 
harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
Chalet Gourmet -- 7880 W. Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 874-6301. A minimum 
$35 order is required for delivery. There's no charge for local service, but 
one may be added as distance from the store increases. Orders may be placed 
from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Delivery time depends on the size of the order and 
distance from the store -- it may be as quick as 15 minutes for a delicatessen

MUSIC CENTER GEARS UP FOR A GALA 25TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A yearlong parade of about a Dozen events celebrating the first quarter century 
of the Los Angeles Music Center was announced Wednesday by center officials in 
the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-anniversary events range from free performances in the three 
performing-arts theaters and a party on the plaza the night of Dec. 6 to swank 
galas, a private Hawaiian weekend and a signed Sam Francis commemorative 
lithograph for the very top donors. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center formally opened Dec. 6, 1964, when the Pavilion raised its 
curtain for the first time with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and violinist Jascha Heifetz as soloist. The Mark Taper Forum and 
the Ahmanson opened in April, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed a better community, a better people, for what goes on in this 
cultural campus," said Joseph Pinola, chairman and chief executive officer of 
First Interstate Bancorp and chairman of the board of governors of the Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary announcement, attended by political and arts officials, was 
made in the same hall where last month the Music Center named Frank O. Gehry of 
Venice, Calif., as architect of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the $100-million 
structure that will become the fourth building in the Music Center complex. 
</P>
<P>
F. Daniel Frost, president of the Music Center Foundation and a co-chairman of 
the anniversary event, traced the history of the Music Center and commended 
"the public sector-private sector partnership" that became "a role model for 
the entire country." 
</P>
<P>
He then read a statement that Dorothy Buffum Chandler, the Music Center's 
founder, wrote at the opening of the building that bears her name: "In a world 
more immediately imperiled by mediocrity than intercontinental missiles, the 
Music Center will stand forever as a symbol of what creative man can accomplish 
when he sets high his standards and has vision far beyond our present 
horizons." 
</P>
<P>
Frost added that on Tuesday he had spoken with Mrs. Chandler about the 
25th-anniversary celebration activities, and read to her from a history of the 
center that had been prepared for the Disney Hall architectural subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Frost said she told him: "I can hardly believe that 25 years have passed so 
quickly. I don't think I could have done it if I had realized at the beginning 
what was involved. And I certainly would not have been able to do it without 
the loyal support of so many friends, the dedication of the Board of 
Supervisors throughout and the understanding and total backing of my wonderful 
husband, Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to give something back to the 
community that has given so much to my family and to me," Mrs. Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to its future, the Music Center also announced establishment of 
a newly formed International Council that will sponsor a 21st-Century Arts 
Award program. Each year, the Music Center will seek out and pay tribute to 
three outstanding young artists in music, dance and theater. "History is only 
meaningful as a prelude to the future," said Music Center President Esther 
Wachtell. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the quarter-century celebration, a multicultural community arts 
festival highlighting Southern California's diversity will take place on the 
Music Center plaza July 8 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 23, there will be a dinner for major donors and Music Center 
officials. On Sept. 24, the center will feature its resident companies in an 
anniversary performance in the Pavilion. The program will offer performances by 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Music Center Opera, the Joffrey 
Ballet, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper 
Forum and Ahmanson Theatre. Nick Vanoff and Gary Pudney are producing the 
event, which is expected to eventually become a television special. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, the center's resident companies will commemorate the 
anniversary with special performances. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper will dedicate three programs to the anniversary, including the world 
premiere of "Sansei" on the main stage March 23 through May 7, created and 
performed by the band Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Music Center Opera will present Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's 
"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny." 
</P>
<P>
The production was conceived for Los Angeles by British director Jonathan 
Miller and Los Angeles artist Robert Israel -- or, as Livingston quipped: "The 
setting of this will take place in Hollywood -- perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 30 through Dec. 3, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will present Stravinsky's 
"Oedipus Rex" conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and directed by Taper artistic 
director Gordon Davidson. The Los Angeles Chorale will participate. 
</P>
<P>
On April 22, the Los Angeles Master Chorale has designated its "Scottish 
Highland Celebration" featuring Jean Redpath as its commemorative event. 
</P>
<P>
Although Music Center officials were anticipating privately that 
President-elect George Bush and his wife, Barbara, would be honorary co-chairs 
of a "glittering gala" for 1,000 persons to follow the Sept. 24 performance, it 
is uncertain whether they will be able to do so. While Pinola said with a smile 
that Bush "went ahead and got himself elected," anniversary event co-chair 
Nancy Livingston added: "It doesn't mean that that won't happen."

STEPPING ABOARD THE STARSHIP 'ENTERPRISE' 
</P>

<P>
Watching Howie Seago drop his dark gray felt hat onto his strawberry blond 
curls, there was no question he was an actor. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't just put on his hat. He did it with style and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Seago has had to be more purposeful than most of his acting colleagues. He is 
deaf, which limits job possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made the work myself by my own perseverance," he said in an interview 
at Los Angeles International Airport the other day, where he had a couple of 
hours to spare between planes. 
</P>
<P>
Most actors have dreamt up characters whom they would like to play on a popular 
TV show. In Seago's case, he took his idea for a deaf character on "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" to the show's producers last summer, and the result is an 
episode in which he guest stars as a 24th-Century mediator, not unlike Henry 
Kissinger. The episode airs in Los Angeles at 8 p.m. Saturday and again at 5 
p.m. Sunday on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Hurley, the effusive co-executive producer of "Star Trek," recalled 
that he and his colleagues knew as soon as they met with Seago that they would 
use him on the show in some way. "Because he has the presence of a movie star, 
and I'm saying movie star, I'm not saying just a good actor," he explained. "He 
dominates. You can't take your eyes off him." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't simply Seago's blue-eyed attractiveness. It's his way of 
communicating. 
</P>
<P>
Since he prefers to sign rather than speak, he has several interpreters he uses 
regularly. At the LAX interview, it was Rico Peterson who signed the reporter's 
questions to Seago and spoke Seago's signed responses. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't sound very dramatic, but the 35-year-old Seago used his eyes, 
face, hands and body so expressively that he very nearly gave off sparks. 
Peterson kept up with him, translating sign to word with such close 
synchronicity that the interpreter's presence faded from mind. 
</P>
<P>
Onstage or onscreen, of course, Seago is on his own. Once the cameras began 
rolling on "Star Trek," for example, he needed visual cues from the other 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek" star Patrick Stewart, who worked closely with Seago during filming, 
said, "It requires a technique for communicating which can be learned very 
briefly. By the end of the first day's work, I was unaware that there was 
anything different." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Stewart said, there was something special about the 
experience: "When you're dealing with an actor who has the authentic handicap, 
that person carries an authentic tension around with him and it never 
dissipates; it's always present. Whereas with an actor without the handicap, 
that is necessarily going to fluctuate. And I think all the actors in the show 
were sensitive, aware of, and sometimes even nervous of that very 
idiosyncratric tension. And tension is what makes theater." 
</P>
<P>
Talking Heads musician David Byrne was so impressed when he saw Seago star in a 
1986 adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy "Ajax," staged at Washington, D.C.'s 
Kennedy Center and then at the La Jolla Playhouse, that Byrne and his producing 
partner Robert Wilson recruited Seago for the lead role of the Forest King in a 
play they produced in Germany last fall, "The Forest." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as Achilles in a National Theater of the Deaf production, "The Iliad, 
Play by Play," Seago moved Newsweek's Jack Kroll to write, "Not since Olivier's 
Oedipus has an actor come so close to the primal power of Greek tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
For the role of Caliban in a 1987 La Jolla Playhouse production of "The 
Tempest," Seago competed with hearing actors, and won. 
</P>
<P>
What's significant about the "Star Trek" role for Seago -- aside from the 
exposure, his biggest audience yet -- is that "I started the idea from 
scratch," he said, crediting his wife with the inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife (Lori Seago), who is a Trekkie, suggested to me that since 'Star Trek' 
is science fiction, the problem of providing a voice for a deaf character could 
be handled very creatively." 
</P>
<P>
Developing that thought, Seago "borrowed the idea of using a chorus from 
'Ajax,' " he explained. In the finished "Star Trek" episode, he communicates 
through a chorus of three -- a warrior, a scholar and a cultured woman. "If he 
wants to be aggressive, he'll use the warrior's voice; if he wants to be 
gentle, he'll use the woman. If only it were true in real life!" 
</P>
<P>
The show is the result of an unusual degree of collaboration between guest star 
and producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek's" Hurley recalled that Seago originally brought to them a "general 
idea for a deaf character. He wanted to be a regular on the show, maybe. We had 
a general exploratory conversation and in the course of that, he mentioned 
something that triggered off the whole idea of Henry Kissinger. Then we just 
started working on the story." (Jackie Zambrano is credited as the episode's 
writer.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Seago, "When I first started working, I thought that my character had to 
sign, so the chorus would understand him. But the producers had a more unique 
point of view. They wanted Riva to be arrogant, like Kissinger in real life, so 
his signing became unimportant to him. He and the chorus are so attuned, he 
would communicate with a simple gesture in place of many lines. So when he gets 
to the crisis point (and has lost his chorus), he has to use a more 
conventional mode of signing, which makes for a nice contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first draft clashed with one of Seago's strongly held beliefs, however. "To 
resolve the dilemma when he's cut off from communication, they wanted me (his 
character) to speak overnight," the actor said. "I told them I couldn't do that 
because it would perpetuate the psychological harm that's done now in forcing 
deaf children to use their voice whether they can or not. I didn't want hearing 
parents to use the show to perpetuate the oppression of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"And they (the producers) understood that. I was expecting them to be more 
intractable. That was a real, honest-to-God relief for me and a credit to the 
producers, not only in accepting the idea but in executing and designing it 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Seago can speak understandably, but the issue of speech is a complicated one 
for him. "I grew up in an oral program where sign language was not permitted," 
he said. "It was repressed." Meanwhile, at home, "I used homemade sign language 
with my brothers and my friends all my life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only when I went to college and learned (standard) sign language that I 
started to develop as a person. I'm still angry that I was repressed all those 
years of my education by too much emphasis on learning to speak, rather than 
learning. And that's still going on (in some schools)." 
</P>
<P>
Before he made a decision to stick with signing in professional situations, he 
had some strange meetings with casting directors, he said: "They just didn't 
seem to understand that I was deaf. (He explained that, as a good lip reader, 
he may catch half or three-fourths of what is said.) So they would think of me 
as hard of hearing, or some kind of alien with a strange voice." 
</P>
<P>
A stint at working local theater in Hawaii proved important to the actor 
because "there was a woman who was a director with a youth theater there who 
had a good idea of how to use deaf actors in regular productions," he said. "I 
felt that I was finally free of the ball and chain of being 'a deaf actor.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the TV and movie industries, however, the ball and chain are still there. 
"Theater is more open to nontraditional casting than TV or movies," Seago 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hurley acknowledged that if it hadn't been for the Writers Guild strike 
last summer, Seago and his idea might never have been looked at by the "Star 
Trek" producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting around during the strike," he recalled, "and someone said 'Do 
you want to meet an actor with good credentials, who happens to be deaf?' And 
we did it for that reason -- that there was really not a whole lot else to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone had called me last spring (before the strike), and said, 'There's a 
deaf actor who wants to meet you,' I'd say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call 
you,' but with the time constraints of episodic television, you just don't have 
time to do those kinds of things. Since this happened, it's made me more 
willing to listen to the phone. If some strange phone call came now, I'd think, 
'I better take it. I'd better not miss a chance to meet another Howie Seago.' "

A NOGGIN OF NUTRITION;

<P>
WHOLESOME DRINKS ARE A HEALTHY WAY OF KEEPING THOSE RESOLUTIONS TO LOSE WEIGHT.

<P>
More than 40% of the American adult population perceive themselves to be 
overweight, according to an independent national study, released Tuesday by 
Weight Watchers International, Inc. Of those, some two-thirds went on a diet at 
least once last year and will begin another in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The preoccupation with weight-loss is especially prevalent at this time of 
year. Upwards of 1.2 million people across the nation have already begun their 
New Year's resolutions and enrolled in the Weight Watchers program. (The 
organization's average weekly attendance is 600,000, according to a company 
representative.) 
</P>
<P>
The New Year is the time when countless Americans try any means possible -- 
some nutritionally acceptable and some not -- to lose the excess weight 
accumulated during holiday festivities. For many, the gluttony began as far 
back as Thanksgiving and has added as much as 10 to 15 pounds. So they join 
exercise gyms, participate in diet programs, swallow diet capsules and ingest 
diet foods and protein drinks in an effort to shed the extra weight. 
</P>
<P>
The hectic pace of today's life style is one explanation for the popularity of 
radical diets that eliminate food groups or suggest unusual food combinations. 
But dietitians warn against such extreme and unusual methods of losing weight 
-- specifically when undertaken as a means of undoing the damage from the 
holidays. Instead, people are encouraged to choose a sensible eating pattern 
that fits into their individual routine. 
</P>
<P>
A way to accomplish this, according to Linda Dahl, president of the California 
Dietetic Assn., is to resume previous dietary habits that were established 
before the holiday eating frenzy took place and to begin or continue a regular 
exercise program. This means cutting back on high fat foods and controlling 
portion sizes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually if you return to your previous dietary habits and exercise program you 
will return to your previous weight," said Dahl, "and that makes a lot more 
sense than going on a diet, which is temporary and you may go off it and wind 
up in the same place you were during the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
One sensible approach is to eliminate the traditional morning meal and opt 
instead for a nutrient-rich blender drink. Since it is the hour of the day when 
time is at a premium, it tends to be a time when fast-food or coffee and sweets 
are favored. Or, if one's schedule permits and a traditional breakfast meal is 
an option, it typically features high-fat meats like bacon, sausage and eggs, 
pancakes, syrup, fatty breads and spreads or cereals loaded with cream and 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
But a nutritionally-adequate blender drink can meet the body's energy supply 
needs as well as the palate's desire for good taste, and for a lot fewer 
calories. These beverages can be powerhouses of nourishment when packed with 
foods rich in vitamins and minerals. They offer waistline-watchers an 
alternative to high-fat breakfast fare on the run. 
</P>
<P>
By combining wholesome ingredients such as nonfat milk and yogurt, dried and 
fresh fruits, vegetables and grains, it is possible to achieve the 
calorie-sparing benefit of a light meal, provided that sufficient fiber and 
other nutrients are included in meals the remainder of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"People are in a hurry in the morning," Dahl said, "We've gotten away from the 
traditional breakfast. I think that beverages are handy but the problem I have 
with them is they are very low in fiber. We manage to get in the fruit and the 
milk, but we don't get in the insoluble fiber." 
</P>
<P>
To increase the amount of fiber in the beverage meal, Dahl explained, add a 
tablespoon of bran to the mixture. It lends sufficient fiber. Then, include 
whole grain breads, legumes and other carbohydrate-rich foods in the remaining 
daily meals to meet the recommended daily allowance of fiber. 
</P>
<P>
This way, Dahl said, nutrition drinks "can fit into a sensible diet program -- 
especially for people on the run," as long as they are not denying themselves 
food and using the beverages as an entire intake for the day. That doesn't 
teach people how to choose lower fat foods and control portion sizes. "We're 
not talking about the modified fasts for weight reduction," she emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
Bananas, fruit juice, dairy products and wheat germ are the most popular 
ingredients in blender drinks. But, if meeting the daily requrement for fiber 
isn't a problem, use the juice extractor for fresh, natural juices from all 
sorts of vegetables. The automatic juice extractor will separate solids from 
almost every fruit and vegetable imaginable, leaving the pure concentrated 
juice for use in recipes. 
</P>
<P>
If a juice extractor is not an option, use the blender to puree such fruits as 
pears, peaches and berries. It will create nectar rather than clear juices, but 
these can be strained and diluted with water or thin juice and combined with 
crushed ice for a thick and frosty drink. 
</P>
<P>
Pureed, steamed vegetables are another possibility. Mix with clear fruit juices 
or homemade chicken broth (it is lower in sodium than commercial brands) and 
serve with cucumber slices, radishes, celery or carrot sticks or sweet pepper 
strips for swizzlers. Health food stores or the health food section of the 
supermarket also have large displays of vegetable juices including some 
surprising ones such as spinach, celery and cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure nutritional adequacy of the beverage, here is a list of important 
vitamins and minerals, their function in the body and their dietary sources. 
Follow the recipes given, then mix and match according to the desired taste or 
nutrient emphasis. Oat bran is a good alternative to wheat germ, but we learned 
when developing these recipes in The Times Test Kitchen that the oat bran tends 
to thicken the drink upon standing. Therefore, unless several people will be 
served, those recipes should be scaled down to serve only one then doubled when 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vitamin A: Needed for normal cell growth, healthy lining of body cavities 
and glands, healthy bones and teeth, maintenance of the cornea; its precursor, 
beta carotene, is linked to cancer prevention. Food sources: green leafy 
vegetables such as spinach, turnip tops, chard and beet greens; green stem 
vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli; yellow vegetables such as carrots, 
sweet potatoes, winter squash and pumpkin; and orange fruits such as apricots, 
peaches and cantaloupe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vitamin C: Important for cell formation, synthesis of collagen and 
absorption and use of iron. Deficiencies usually result in poor wound healing, 
poor bone and tooth development and, although rare today, scurvy. Food sources: 
citrus fruits, pineapple, berries, tomatoes, melons, cabbage, broccoli, 
strawberries, potatoes and some green leafy vegetables like kale, cabbage, 
kohlrabi and greens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vitamin D: Necessary for calcium and phosphorous regulation to prevent 
brittle bones and teeth. Food sources: fortified milk and very small amounts in 
egg yolk and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vitamin E: Primary function is as an antioxidant. It prevents oxygen from 
combining with other substances and damaging them. Deficiency is rare since it 
is widespread in plant foods. Food sources: vegetable oils are principal source 
but whole grains, wheat germ and dark leafy vegetables contain appreciable 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vitamin K: Fat-soluble vitamin necessary for blood clotting. Food sources: 
green leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calcium: Responsible for bone and tooth formation, blood clotting and nerve 
transmission. Many women fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for 
this mineral and as a result may suffer brittle bone disease (osteoporosis) at 
menopause. Food sources: dairy products -- milk, cheese and yogurt -- tofu, 
greens and some whole grains. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Iron: Found as a component of blood protein (hemoglobin) and muscle protein 
(myoglobin). It enables these proteins to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide 
to and from body cells. Intake is usually below the RDA. Food sources: whole 
grain and enriched cereal products contribute substantial amounts as do peas, 
deep green leafy vegetables, dried fruits such as raisins and apricots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magnesium: A factor in bone mineralization, muscular contraction, 
maintenance of teeth and protein building. Food sources: whole grains, green 
vegetables, chocolate and cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Potassium: One of three minerals found in the body that preserve water 
balance. The others are sodium and chloride. None are particularly regarded as 
in short supply in the body since they are all widely available in food. Food 
sources: bananas, potatoes, milk and plain yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Zinc: Involved in making genetic material and the normal development of the 
fetus, the transport of Vitamin A, taste perception and wound healing. Food 
sources: whole grains.

LUNCHEON OR DINNER; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECT ETIQUETTE FOR SERVING SOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When soup is served for a luncheon or dinner, Emily Post's "Etiquette" offers 
the following advice: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soup should be the first of six courses. It should be followed by fish, the 
entree, salad, dessert and coffee. Six is the maximum number of courses for 
even the most elaborate dinner; and for an informal luncheon, two or three 
courses are sufficient -- soup, entree and dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soup at a luncheon is served in two-handled cups. The soup is eaten with a 
teaspoon, or the cup may be picked up and the soup may be sipped, if it has 
sufficiently cooled. A clear soup is usually served. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sherry is the first wine offered at dinner, and then usually with a soup 
that contains Sherry in the preparation. Sherry should never be offered with 
cream of chicken soup or vichyssoise, but with turtle or black-bean soup, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clear soups are often served in a shallow bowl rather than a cup. When the 
level of soup is so low that you must lift the bowl to avoid scraping the 
bottom, lift the near edge with your left hand and tip the bowl away from you. 
Then spoon the soup away from you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both soup cups and soup bowls should be served with a saucer or plate 
beneath them. The spoon, when not in use or when the soup is finished, is laid 
on the saucer underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Vanderbilt, in the "Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette," says soup 
should always be kept flowing in the opposite direction from one's lap. The 
soup spoon should be filled from its far side, and soup then poured gently into 
the mouth with its near side. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt says that if dumplings, vegetables, mushrooms or other garnishes are 
floating on top, eat these first by using the spoon, before the liquid part of 
the soup is drunk. If noodles are at the bottom of the bowl, spoon them up 
before consuming the liquid. 
</P>
<P>
If you take a large spoonful of extremely hot soup, don't spit it out, 
concludes Vanderbilt. Instead, take a quick drink of water to cool your mouth. 
If you have burned your mouth, an exception may be made to the rule against 
drinking with food already in your mouth.

RECORD BEEF PRICES PROJECTED FOR '89; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE GROUPS CITE HERD REDUCTIONS, EXPECT 4%-7% JUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Record-high beef prices are in store for consumers in the coming months, 
according to meat industry projections. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates vary on the extent of the increase, but two leading trade groups 
expect prices to jump between 4% and 7% above last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
And premium cuts, such as steaks and roasts, will rise at a rate well in excess 
of the average cost for all beef products. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the hikes are steady reductions in the nation's herds. In fact, 1989 
will mark the first time since the early 1960s that fewer than 100 million head 
of cattle are being raised in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complex Reasons Given 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, declines in consumer demand for beef and competition from other 
protein sources such as chicken forced cattlemen to thin their livestock 
holdings. The decreased meat supplies resulting from widespread liquidations 
are now responsible for the rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the availability of leaner cuts has renewed interest in the leading 
red meat. Even consumers who may have avoided beef because of its fat content 
are taking another look at the slimmed-down version marketed as USDA Select 
Grade. Also contributing to the change in beef's fortunes is a 
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer perceptions of beef have improved in the last year or two. The beef 
in the retail case is a leaner product that is more consistent with demand," 
said Chuck Lambert, an economist with the National Cattlemen's Assn. in Denver. 
"But it will be one or two years before we can respond with increased supplies 
to meet the changes." 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, consumers can expect prices to reach a peak during a 
three-month period beginning in February, according to Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The average price currently paid for all beef cuts at the retail level is $2.81 
a pound, down slightly from an all-time high of $2.85 reached in late 1988. 
However, the present price will begin an upward swing in the coming months and 
hover at a $2.90-a-pound average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reverse 
</P>
<P>
The renewed interest in beef, however, is not expected to reverse a decade-long 
slide in per capita consumption. The disparity between consumption rates and 
retail costs exists because the industry has better balanced supplies and 
demand than has been the case in decades. 
</P>
<P>
Citing U.S. Department of Agriculture figures, Lambert said that Americans will 
eat about 66.8 pounds of beef in 1989, down from 72.1 pounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, chicken consumption is expected to increase to 65 pounds per person 
a year, or up about 2.5 pounds from 1988's levels. Consumers also eat about 
62.7 pounds of pork annually as well, a level that has remained fairly steady. 
</P>
<P>
Overall per capita meat consumption in the United States now totals about 221 
pounds per person a year, and beef's share of this category will slip below 33% 
for the first time. In fact, USDA projects that chicken will surpass beef as 
the nation's most popular meat sometime in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, this past year there were record supplies of all meats if you total 
pork, poultry and beef," Lambert said. "There is a lot of competition for 
consumer spending and the (other) meats have gained market share. We are not 
operating in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing news about consumption trends, 1989 will be the fifth 
consecutive year that cattlemen have seen profits, Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining profitability, though, will require that the industry constantly 
juggle production levels in order to prevent consumer resistance to steadily 
higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the best of times for producers because it is putting money in their 
bank accounts," said Rosemary Mucklow, executive director of the Oakland-based 
Western States Meat Assn. "But if, in the process, the public gets turned off 
from the product then . . . that will be sad." 
</P>
<P>
When beef costs skyrocketed in the early 1970s, for instance, many people 
readily turned to other meat and non-meat protein sources. This time around, a 
move away from beef would be much easier on the public psyche because of 
changes in dietary habits that can be traced, in part, to that very era. 
</P>
<P>
Also entering the pricing equation is the European Economic Community's ban on 
sales of U.S. beef treated with growth hormones, a trade measure that went into 
effect on Jan. 1. There is some uncertainty, though, about the actual impact 
this action will have on domestic prices. Much of the U.S. beef sold to Europe 
is composed of specialty cuts -- such as organ meats -- that are not popular in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beef Byproducts 
</P>
<P>
Mucklow said that the beef byproducts the Europeans are rejecting may force 
producers to raise prices elsewhere in order to compensate for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are more beef byproducts on our domestic market, then their price 
will go down because liver and kidney is not consumed much here. And if those 
items become cheaper, then there is more (upward price) pressure on the balance 
of the carcass to even things out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Countering the export loss in Europe, however, may be an expanded market for 
U.S. beef in Japan. Under a recently signed trade agreement, the Japanese will 
import 60,000 metric tons of American beef annually for the next three years. 
At that point, the Japanese will lift the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, though, the Japanese are likely to be interested primarily in the 
premium cuts of beef, said Lambert of National Cattlemen's. 
</P>
<P>
And it is these premium cuts -- sirloin, prime rib, etc. -- that will 
experience the sharpest increases in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"The premium cuts are the loin and rib, the center meat in the animal," said 
Mucklow. "You cannot increase the prices of the beef rounds or chucks the way 
you can the premium cuts. Out of the whole carcass you cannot increase the cost 
of the byproducts, the briskets, whatever, as you can the steaks and roast. 
When everything goes up 5% to 10%, the center cuts go up much higher." 
</P>
<P>
While the current conditions linger, however, cattlemen can congratulate 
themselves on deriving profit from declining market share. 
</P>
<P>
"Beef is going back on the center of the plate again," said Mucklow. "People 
realize the value of having it in the diet. They are missing it and pleased to 
have it back again. But if beef is priced out of the pockets of most people, 
then that would be very unfortunate."

HINTS FROM HELOISE: USING LEFTOVER BREAD FOR CROUTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have the greatest recipe for turning leftover French bread into 
homemade croutons. They are wonderful to put in salads or for just plain 
snacking. 
</P>
<P>
The recipe calls for one-half loaf of French bread, one teaspoon of minced 
basil (fresh is best), two cloves of minced garlic and one stick of butter or 
margarine. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat your oven to 275 degrees and simmer the butter, basil and garlic in a 
sauce pan. While the butter mixture is simmering, cube the French bread and 
place the cubes in a roasting pan. Pour the butter mixture over the bread cubes 
and place them in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until they are 
golden brown and very crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
Store the homemade croutons in a tightly sealed plastic container. 
</P>
<P>
 -- PATRICIA, Massapequa, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: If you have ever covered a pan of yeast dough with plastic wrap 
to help it rise faster, you know how the dough can stick to the wrap. To 
prevent this, I spray one side of the plastic wrap with non-stick vegetable 
spray and put that side against the dough. 
</P>
<P>
When the dough is ready to bake, the wrap peels off easily. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LINDA, Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: If you have a pastry blender in your utensil drawer, you'll be 
surprised at how many times one can come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
They are perfect for mashing avocados, bananas or any other slightly soft food. 
Try using it to mix up dips, cream cheese or anything that is too stiff to be 
mixed in the blender. You can also use a pastry blender as a substitute wire 
whisk for beating eggs. 
</P>
<P>
I guarantee you'll love using it and will find a pastry blender to be one of 
the handiest things around your kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROSEMARY, Baltimore, Md. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Before filling a store-bought pie shell with filling, I had to 
remove the clear plastic protective shield from the pie crust. This is when I 
came up with an ingenious idea for reusing it that I would like to share. 
</P>
<P>
I washed and dried it. When the pie was ready to be placed in the refrigerator 
for chilling, I inverted the cover over the pie and crimped the foil edges of 
the pie pan over to hold it in place. The shield proved to be very useful and 
could be taken off and on as many times as needed. 
</P>
<P>
So, next time you buy a pie-crust shell that is protected by a plastic shield, 
by all means don't throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LOUISE, Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When preparing a whole chicken for frying, if you don't care for 
the neck and giblets, don't throw them away. Try this: Boil them and freeze the 
broth for future soup stock, gravies and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Levelland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: After many years of my skinny silverware handles falling through 
the basket in my dishwasher, I have finally found a simple solution. 
</P>
<P>
I cut some plastic mesh (used for crafts) to fit into the bottom of the 
silverware basket. This keeps the handles from falling through, and I am able 
to place the handles down, the way I prefer to wash them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEANNE, Sun City West, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I fix apples for my children's lunches, I like to cut and 
core them to make them easy to eat. 
</P>
<P>
To keep them from turning brown by lunchtime, I squeeze the juice of one lime 
into a resealable bag, add the apple slices and agitate. The slices go into 
another bag for lunch, and they stay tart and fresh.

DEAR HELOISE: Whenever I find a hint or a recipe, I clip it out and tape it to 
the product. I taped a special recipe for a tuna casserole to the tuna can. If 
I find a cleaning hint, I tape it to whatever has to be cleaned so the next 
time I can try it. It works real well for me. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GAY, Bradford, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm writing you about a letter from a reader who placed a 
tablecloth on the table for her son's birthday party. Then she had the children 
sign their names on it and she embroidered their names. You stated it could be 
used for future parties. 
</P>
<P>
I think it would be nice to put the date and year on the cloth, using a 
different color for each year. After a while this could be quite a conversation 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 -- P. C., Westerville, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Shopping used to be one of my favorite things to do. Now that I 
have a small child, it can be something else. He would get quite cranky after a 
couple of stores and I would end up going home without finishing my shopping. 
</P>
<P>
So, we made a pact. If he behaves while I finish all my shopping, then he gets 
to choose a store or other place that he wants to visit. This way he is more 
tolerant of my shopping and looks forward to our shopping trips. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY, Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I appreciated the tip about using a skewer to get a small amount 
of lemon juice, so I thought I'd return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
For fresh and easy lemon, lime or orange peel, save the skins in a sealed bag 
in the freezer. When a recipe calls for them, they're much easier to grate when 
frozen and taste incredibly better than the expensive grated peels in bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN, Rapid City, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm an elderly citizen and sometimes forget that I have taken my 
vitamins. I turn the container over after I have taken them for that day so I 
will always know at a glance if I have taken them. Simple, effective and 
relieves stress and doubt. 
</P>

THE KITCHEN CABINET: GETTING THE WRINKLES OUT OF SHOPPING FOR A NEW IRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's just no escape to ironing, a domestic chore that has pressed its way 
back from the Egyptian era to modern day. And with the resurgence of natural 
fibers, laundry irons have become even hotter. Another trend that puts irons 
back to work is dressed-up tables, using a variety of interesting fabrics for 
tablecloths, overlays and napkins. A far cry from the clunky and heavy early 
electric inventions, the new streamlined irons are lightweight, a feature that 
can be attributed to improvements in plastic technology. 
</P>
<P>
Today there's an iron for every whim or need. If you're forgetful, there are 
irons equipped with electronic timers and microchip controllers that shut off 
automatically when not in use. If you can't live without the spray bottle, you 
definitely should look into an iron that features a spray button, which 
releases thin jets of water to dampen those creases. And don't worry about 
having to use distilled water, another great development is that the new irons 
can take tap water. 
</P>
<P>
And who's got the best steam? Competing in this hot arena are models with 
"burst of steam" features and larger reservoir capacity. Another welcomed 
factor is ease in ironing and cleaning. To alleviate this common problem, 
soleplates now come finished with specially treated, easy-glide, non-stick 
coatings. And if looks are important to you, some irons now come in fashion 
colors, in bold or pastel shades. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in the market for a new iron this year, these newer irons were 
designed to make ironing a more pleasant and bearable task for you. 
</P>
<P>
The most unique feature of the Tefal Steam Iron is its extremely smooth 
soleplate. In tests conducted by ironing across the zipper on a pair of jeans 
12,000 times, non-stop, the soleplate on the Tefal iron came out like new -- 
smooth and scratch-free. This lightweight iron from France exclusively features 
Super Gliss soleplate, a coating of pure Durilium. Tefal's theory is that when 
the plate is scratched, it picks up starch and dirt and becomes difficult to 
clean. Easy gliding is possible because friction between the fabric being 
ironed and the iron surface is also reduced by up to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Sleek-looking in white with pastel trims, the Tefal irons are available in two 
types of model series: the more deluxe Pressing Plus series (from $75 to $80) 
and the lightweight Pressing Light Series ($60). The first type, which comes in 
two models, features the following: an automatic shut-off system after 30 
seconds in a horizontal position and after five minutes when left upright; a 
self-cleaning feature, an anti-clogging valve, six temperature control settings 
to suit any fabric, water spray button, burst of steam (30 grams steam per 
minute) a transparent water tank with 7 1/2-ounce capacity, a reversible cord 
for left or right hand use and convenient cord storage in heel. 
</P>
<P>
The Pressing Light Series has all of the above features except for the 
automatic shut-off and limited burst of steam functions; both irons provide a 
10-year limited warranty on the soleplate. 
</P>
<P>
A company that's been in the iron business for over 75 years and who pioneered 
the first automatic steam iron is Rowenta from West Germany. In addition to its 
popular line of Tapmaster Iron series (from $55) that features all the bells 
and whistles found in an ideal steam-and-spray iron, Rowenta has included two 
advanced models. The latest and and most exciting addition is the Rowenta 
Excellence Iron DA-82 ($75). This powerful 1,200-watt iron is designed with a 
convenient "tank-within-a tank" system that maintains hydrostatic pressure 
necessary inside the water tank to produce a constant level of steam no matter 
how much water is in the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
The Excellence iron seems to have a mind of its own. As the density of fabrics 
increases, the steam pressure increases, forcing steam into the nap of even the 
most difficult fabrics; and vice versa for light and delicate fabrics. The 
water tank is transparent and detachable and when removed, one can maneuver the 
iron under cuffs or inside pleats. Aside from having the power to deliver a 
super shot of steam on demand, the Rowenta iron has extra large-size soleplate 
for greater steam distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The Rowenta Control Electronic Iron DA-80 ($80) offers a full shiny metal base 
and is said to "think on its feet" even when it's not standing. Like the Tefal 
iron, it is equipped with a microchip that enables the iron to turn off 
automatically if it is left resting on its base for 30 seconds or if left 
upright unattended 8 minutes. But going a step further, the Rowenta version 
even turns off automatically if it tips over or drops to the floor. The 
shut-off is indicated by a built-in audible alarm that instantly beeps for two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Another appliance manufacturer that has been taking irons seriously for years 
is Proctor-Silex. Made in the USA, the newer offerings range from mid-size 
lightweight irons (from $17 to $27) to full-size irons (from $33 to $48). Each 
mid-size unit has a reversible cord that wraps up and snaps securely for neat 
storage. They're available in white body and colored handle cover and trim 
(slate blue, light gray or almond). 
</P>
<P>
The full-size irons from Proctor-Silex have extra-large soleplates with 53 
steam vents for wider coverage. The plates also have slim points with button 
grooves for quick ironing of collars, sleeves and around buttons. The full-size 
iron range includes models with electronic shut-off memory (shuts off when left 
unattended on its heel for 15 minutes, or unmoved on its soleplate for 30 
seconds); blast of steam and spray features; SilverStone, and self-cleaning 
plates. The irons are also available in white with pastel trims. 
</P>
<P>
Last but not least is the steam/spray/dry Caretex Iron ($80) from Robert Krups. 
The 1,000-watt iron has an adjustable steam feature for varied types of fabric. 
Its see-through water tank is removable. The professional-type iron comes with 
a unique napped fabric shoe that is a separate ironing piece shaped like the 
iron's flat surface, but with many more holes for even steam distribution. This 
helps eliminate the sheen that you get when ironing corduroy, flannel and 
velvet. Other features include automatic steam shut off and power spray. 
</P>
<P>
The Tefal Pressing Plus irons are available at Bullock's and Adray's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Krups Caretex irons are available at selected Broadway stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rowenta irons are available at Bullock's and Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Proctor-Silex irons are available at May Co., JC Penney and Long's Drugs.

LET'S EAT OUT: MUMTAZ IS A COMER ON MELROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I knew a fellow named Mumtaz when I was growing up in New York. We called him 
"Mummy," for short. Mummy was a street kid. Tough, rough. Raw. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Mumtaz restaurant sign jumped out at me on Melrose Avenue while I 
was driving by one day, I knew I had to see what was inside. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurant is a far cry from the Mumtaz I knew. I mean 
personality-wise. The Mumtaz restaurant is, by comparison, feminine (named 
after the Queen Mumtaz, who inspired the Taj Mahal) and elegant -- or at least 
it tries very hard to be -- for a place without the trappings of decor or 
design. Even so, the crisp pink napkins standing like soldiers at attention on 
the plates, the Indian sitar music undulating in the background, the bow-tied 
waiters, whose manner is reminiscent of Colonial India, ooze a sense of decayed 
grandeur that I find charming. 
</P>
<P>
Mumtaz is a neighborhood restaurant and nothing more. Nor does it pretend, I 
think, to be more. Yet the food, to my pleasant surprise, was more than I 
expected. Good show, really, for a struggling 
I-don't-know-how-they-manage-but-they-do, not-with-it, restaurant on the 
hottest spot on restaurant row. I plan to make Mumtaz a regular answer to my 
frequent curry and Indian bread cravings. 
</P>
<P>
Mumtaz's cuisine, however, covers a range of Indian cuisines, from north, south 
and southeast regions, represented in such dishes as the Northern tandoori, 
Southern curries and Southeastern vegetarian fare. 
</P>
<P>
There are two prix-fixe dinners -- vegetarian and five-course kebab or curry 
dinner with dessert for $10.95 and $15.95, respectively, that will give you a 
good range of the cuisine. Or, if you're around for lunch, stop by and try some 
of the combination luncheons, which include samplings of items from several 
regions, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the individual dishes are relatively inexpensive and abundant for 
the price (which range from $1.95 for some very good deep-fried onion cakes, to 
$15.95 for King prawns cooked with tomatoes) and worth mixing and matching 
according to your taste. 
</P>
<P>
The categories will help you develop a menu. You can start with appetizers 
(don't miss the onion pakoraz, the Mumtaz version of Tony Roma's fried onion 
rings, except that these are shaped into cakes. The samosas, stuffed pastries 
filled with minced meat or potatoes, were outstanding, thanks to the delicately 
crisp and flaky crust that I found better than the oil-drenched samosa crusts 
one finds even in the grandest restaurants. The chicken tikka served as an 
appetizer is almost as abundant as entree tikkas are at other Indian restaurant 
menus. So you're getting a good deal, even if you stick only to two or three 
appetizers. But don't. Give the restaurant a break and order a few of the 
entrees. 
</P>
<P>
The breads are terrific, by the way. And if you want to start with a nibble of 
food before the dishes parade in, a fine pappdam -- the crisp, spicy wafer 
served with dipping sauces -- should help. It's not to an Indian waiter's 
liking to serve bread as a premeal snack because bread is customarily served 
with the meal in India. But he'll fetch it graciously and soon learn that in 
Los Angeles -- maybe the United States -- bread is an antidote to 
finger-tapping disease. The naan was extraordinary. The layered wheat paratha 
was so-so, although it seems to have been so-so no matter where I have dined. 
</P>
<P>
The yogurt-marinated tikka dishes (chicken and lamb) were exceptionally good. 
So were the tandoori dishes (those cooked in the vertical clay tandoori oven). 
Among them whole tandoori quail is offered along with chicken, fish, lobster 
and prawns, plus the tikka and kebabs. 
</P>
<P>
I like to dig into the curries category of Indian menus; and there are several 
to choose from, including the classic vindaloo, which is hot enough to rocket 
you to the moon. When Mumtaz says hot, it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
The massala, a yogurt-tomato sauce curry is also good. I'll try the Madras 
another time. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few biryani dishes, including pulao, the saffroned basmati rice. 
The biryanis are mixed dishes, including some type of meat or vegetable. 
Seafood lovers will find a few very interesting dishes, such as shrimp dhansak, 
a slightly sweet and sour shrimp cooked with lentils and herbs (for the 
extra-daring), and bhoona, made with shrimp fried in butter and simmered in a 
spicy sauce. There are lots of vegetables to choose from: dal turka (lentils 
cooked in butter and garlic); brijal bhajee (spicy eggplant); bhendi massala 
(okra fried with onions) the palak paneer (cheese and spinach) and mixed 
vegetables. So there is just no way a vegetarian can go hungry at Mumtaz. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will you go dessert-less if you have a sweet tooth, although Western taste 
for East Indian dessert is generally open to argument. I don't find Indian 
desserts to my liking. I'm not crazy about the unsweetened rice pudding, the 
too-sweet gulab jamun (milk powder fried balls soaked in syrup) or the 
pistachio ice cream that tastes like mastic. But it's all a matter of taste. No 
offense, chef. 
</P>
<P>
Two things worth mentioning: The chef's specialty of Kashmir tandoori chicken, 
stuffed with minced lamb and served with fried rice, serves two for $25. I 
suggest you give them a hour's notice if you're in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
For a party at the restaurant or at your own home, you can order a whole leg of 
lamb served Muglai style with a massala sauce, enough for 15 to 20 persons. At 
$80, it comes with appetizers and desserts. Give Mumtaz a 24-hour notice and a 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mumtaz, 7166 Melrose Ave. (213) 933-2945. Open for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 
2:30 p.m.; dinner from 5:30 p.m. to closing (last man out). Reservations 
accepted. Major credit cards. Wine and beer license pending.

COOK IT LIGHT: CHICKEN RECIPE CUTS FAT WITHOUT LOSING FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: I've enclosed one of my favorite recipes for revision. It's 
delicious, but I think a few of the calories could be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SHARON, Olympia, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHICKEN PARISIENNE 
</P>
<P>
2 whole chicken breasts, halved 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1 small onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sliced mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
1 (10 3/4-ounce) can cream of chicken soup 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup Sherry 
</P>
<P>
Season breasts with salt and pepper. Melt butter in skillet. Brown chicken on 
both sides. Arrange chicken, onion and mushrooms in baking dish. Combine soup, 
sour cream and Sherry in separate bowl. Pour over chicken. Bake at 400 degrees 
40 to 50 minutes. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with rice. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SHARON: My revision of your recipe will require just a little more work on 
your part, but the end result will be just as tasty and much better for you. 
</P>
<P>
I was able to achieve a substantial reduction in the calories and cut the 
cholesterol and fat by about half simply by making the recipe with homemade 
cream soup instead of canned. This also results in a huge reduction in sodium 
and eliminates the additives many canned soups contain. 
</P>
<P>
By substituting margarine for the butter and by reducing the amount used, fat 
and cholesterol are further reduced. Yogurt works beautifully in place of the 
sour cream; and you can lower the calories, cholesterol and sodium in my 
revision even further by simply removing the skin of the chicken before you 
cook it. In fact, per serving you can save about 80 calories, 10 milligrams 
cholesterol and another 10 grams of fat if you cook the chicken with the skin 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
You will notice a big difference in my revised casserole when it cools down -- 
no more thick layer of congealed fat covering the top. 
</P>
<P>

ABOUT WINE: SATTUI WINERY PROVES THAT THE WAY TO THE PALATE IS VIA THE STOMACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. HELENA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Just look at that building!" exclaimed the tourist. Then, checking into a 
sheaf of travel literature, she said to those around her: "This place is 100 
years old. Wow." 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Sattui was amused by that remark late one cold winter afternoon. It's 
just what he would like people to think. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Sattui wants his successful Napa Valley winery to look as if 
it's been here a long while, even though the building is only 3 years old. But 
to Daryl, it stands as a tribute to hard-headedness and to the belief that a 
dream can be turned into a phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Phenomenon is the word most apt for this winery, which started out on a 
shoestring and managed to buck all the odds despite naysayers every step of the 
way. Today, the operation grosses $4.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the winery is V. Sattui, and even some wine connoisseurs have never 
heard of it, because it sells no wine in retail stores and has just four 
restaurant accounts; 99% of the wine is sold consumer-direct. 
</P>
<P>
Sattui himself is an anomaly, a man who always wanted to make great wines and 
who today does just that, but who started out with no money, no skill as a wine 
maker or grape grower, and absolutely no idea that what he was trying to do was 
next to impossible. However, Daryl used a unique approach to marketing wine: 
through food. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch meat, more specifically. As well as picnic tables, sourdough bread and a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
A writer trying to tell the Sattui story faces some convoluted concepts that 
only a plethora of paragraphs will unravel. It starts with the recent history 
of the Napa Valley, circa 1973. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, before wine developed the cult following it has in the last 
decade, California 29, which runs through the gut of the Napa Valley, was a 
tourist's dreamscape. In the 18-mile stretch of two-lane road between 
Yountville and Calistoga, one could stop every mile or so to sample, without 
charge, the fruits of some farmer's labors. 
</P>
<P>
There was Mondavi on the left, BV on the right, Inglenook across the road, the 
then-new Franciscan on the right, Sutter Home to the left and Martini on the 
east side. As the day wore on, travelers would feel a tad peckish. But where to 
eat? 
</P>
<P>
Outside of a couple of often-filled coffee shops in St. Helena, there were few 
places in which one could have a modest meal. (Some expensive restaurants did 
exist, of course, but they were a half-day proposition and costly.) 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Sattui saw the need for a cheese shop/deli where travelers could buy 
salami, rolls and a pickle and then pop outside to a picnic table to eat, 
without having to pack it into a car and go to some remote grassy area. 
</P>
<P>
Sattui envisioned selling a submarine sandwich and a bottle of his own wine -- 
the perfect ambiance for a wine-country outing. 
</P>
<P>
The image was a natural. Sattui comes from a family of bakers and wine makers. 
His great-grandfather, Vittorio Sattui, had started a winery in San Francisco 
in 1885, growing successful before Prohibition closed its doors. Vittorio lived 
to be 94, and Daryl recalls visiting the patriarch of the family at the old 
winery building and hoping one day to enter the wine business. 
</P>
<P>
But two succeeding generations of Sattuis ignored wine in favor of the 
insurance business, and when Prohibition put V. Sattui Winery into hibernation 
for a half century, Daryl was left with no more than a dream and a load of 
memorabilia from the old San Francisco winery building. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from college and taking a two-year tour of Europe, he returned 
to the Napa Valley and began working at odd jobs. He washed tanks at the 
Christian Brothers, cleaned barrels at Carneros Creek, worked as a tour guide 
at Beaulieu and sold wine in a San Francisco retail shop. But he admits that 
all this "experience" gave him virtually no sense of the business side of 
owning a winery, which he admits he was slow to learn even after deciding in 
1973 to open a winery. 
</P>
<P>
Sattui had about $5,000 of his own at the time (which he had saved by living 
out of his VW bus). This was hardly enough on which to start a winery in the 
Napa Valley, so he wrote a complex business plan and set out to raise $100,000 
from investors. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so stupid I didn't even know that the experts were saying that you 
needed a million bucks to start a winery," says Sattui with a laugh today. 
Eventually, investors gave him all of $52,500. Then a local real estate agent, 
believing Sattui's enthusiasm was a commodity worth banking on, bought a 
four-acre parcel of land on the east side of California 29 south of St. Helena 
and leased it to Daryl, giving him an option to buy the place. 
</P>
<P>
The tasting room was built by the investors, and by 1976 V. Sattui Winery was 
open. Cheese, bread and lunch meat were the drawing cards, as well as a parking 
lot with easy access to California 29. And it was south of St. Helena, which 
meant that hungry travelers coming in from San Francisco would hit Sattui 
before they saw the coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year we sold more food than wine," said Sattui. And since he had 
made no wine in prior years, the wine he sold in the early years was purchased 
in bulk from other wineries and bottled with a label that read "V. Sattui 
Winery," using the logo from his great-grandfather's winery. 
</P>
<P>
I have in my cellar magnums of 1973 and 1974 Sattui Cabernet Sauvignon that I 
bought at the winery in 1977 (for $5 a magnum). Years later, Daryl would reveal 
that that wine was purchased in bulk from the Robert Mondavi winery. 
</P>
<P>
To make his place look authentic, he needed the trappings of a winery, such as 
barrels. "But I couldn't afford barrels. Al Brounstein (owner of Diamond Creek 
Winery in Calistoga) had barrels, but he didn't have any place to store them. 
</P>
<P>
"So I told him he could store his barrels in my winery," said Sattui. For 
years, the barrels that lined the walls inside the Sattui tasting room read 
"Diamond Creek" on the side, but few noticed, and V. Sattui had the ambiance it 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, things were rough. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of money hurt for a long time. Hey, I lived like a pauper for 11 
years. I slept in the winery on an air mattress that I folded up every morning 
and I showered under a faucet in the winery." 
</P>
<P>
The first year he was in business, the "winery" showed a small profit, a 
virtual impossibility in today's world. By 1980, V. Sattui was in full swing. 
Daryl hired as his wine maker Rick Rosenbrand, a local hero who had starred on 
the St. Helena High School basketball team and had attended the University of 
Mississippi on a basketball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't cut out for that kind of life," said the sandy-haired, casually 
dressed Rosenbrand. So he came back to the Napa Valley and began working at 
wineries. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick didn't have any formal training as a wine maker," says Sattui with 
candor, "and frankly, one reason we hired him was, we could get a little help 
from his father." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy was brilliant. Now semi-retired, Theo Rosenbrand had worked for 
years under the great Andre Tchelistcheff at Beaulieu and later, when Rick 
first joined Sattui, Theo was head wine maker at Sterling Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only that, but Rick's mom, Paula, makes the rice-artichoke salad for the 
deli," said Sattui, "and Rick's brother, Ron, is a grower here in the valley. 
It's nice having a family like that around." 
</P>
<P>
As good as the cheeses are, Sattui's wines today are the big attractions in the 
always packed tasting room. Sattui does little advertising, and his major 
merchandising tool is the tasting bar that wraps around the large room and is 
ringed with old casks and loads of hand-printed promotional material about the 
awards the wines have won. 
</P>
<P>
And the awards are numerous, notably for the Cabernet Sauvignons from the 
nearby property of Dick Preston, whose name appears on the labels. Another name 
now being seen on Sattui labels is Suzanne's Vineyard, named for Daryl's wife. 
It is a new 34-acre vineyard adjacent to the winery. 
</P>
<P>
The Sattui Winery was a welcome addition to the valley in the mid-1970s. One 
former resident recalled: 
</P>
<P>
"When Daryl opened his cheese store and deli, I was working for Louis Martini 
(a few hundred yards up the road), and we'd send people down there to have a 
picnic with a bottle of Martini wine, or Daryl's. We all thought it was a great 
idea having a place with tables, cheeses, salami and bread." 
</P>
<P>
But the situation turned heated and controversial some years later as the 
number of wineries in the valley grew and existing wineries wondered if it was 
fair for a cheese shop to call itself a winery. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as Sattui grew more and more successful and applied for permits to 
expand the winery and add parking spaces, seven of his 12 neighbors sued him at 
one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
Sattui defends himself, saying he was a winery all along, that he began making 
wine right from the start, even if it was only a tiny amount. Moreover, he 
says, his expansion plans were modest compared to some other wineries. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, his neighbors (all but two, Daryl admits) agreed that Sattui 
expanded carefully and without undo harm to the community. Today, wine makers 
all over the valley acknowledge privately that Daryl's wines are very good. And 
publicly, they admit that he has one of the best cheese shops in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The tasting room and adjoining cheese-gift shop are busy even in the dead of 
winter, and non-wine goods account for about 35% of V. Sattui's gross sales. 
Included in that total are such items as cutting boards, oatmeal cookies, 
aprons and pot holders. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention paper plates and plastic utensils (25 cents) and plastic wine 
glasses (15 cents). 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-fourth of Sattui's wine sales these days are via mail order, and 
they go to virtually every state in the country. Sattui is pleased that he has 
such strong response to his wines, especially since he does no promotion. "It's 
all word of mouth. People come in here and they like the place, and they like 
the wines, and they go home and order it by mail." 
</P>
<P>
One element they recall is the hand-chiseled stone facing on the winery 
building that makes it look 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait," says Sattui. "When the grape vines start climbing up the side of 
the building, this place will really look old."

FORUM ON HOMELESS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Hollywood Small Business Council will sponsor a community forum from 7 
to 9 p.m. Jan. 24 at Plummer Park's Long Hall to discuss a proposed 
$1.2-million comprehensive center for the homeless on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of speakers will discuss "Sheltering the Homeless." Many of the 
council's more than 80 members own small businesses on the east side and have 
expressed concern about the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-bed permanent facility is to occupy the second floor of a furniture 
company warehouse, 1033 La Brea Ave. Despite objections from some merchants and 
residents, the City Council last September ratified a lease for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said they hope to be able to open the facility by next summer.

LOW-COST HOUSING HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Planning Commission hearing has been set for next Thursday to consider a 
proposed amendment to the city's fledgling General Plan that officials say is 
needed to encourage development of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the City Council, the amendment would be the first since the 
General Plan was adopted last June. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, backed by city housing officials, would allow nonprofit 
developers to build up to twice the number of units allowed under the plan for 
certain low- to moderate-income housing projects of 20 or fewer units, said 
Debbie Potter, the city's housing and economic development manager. 
</P>
<P>
In the parlance of housing officials, low-income people earn 50% to 80% of the 
median income; a moderate income is 80% to 100% of the median. In West 
Hollywood, the median annual income is $18,367 for a single person and $21,060 
for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Potter said a nonprofit developer has expressed interest in building affordable 
housing on a parcel on the city's east side. The General Plan would allow only 
eight units on the land, but the developer insists that at least 16 units are 
needed to make the project economically feasible.

TEACHER DRAFTS APOLOGY FOR UNION CARTOON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's often difficult to find the right words to admit an error. So Culver City 
High School teacher Howard Bennett has said it the way he knows best: in a 
cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Over the New Year's weekend, Bennett mailed his colleagues a cartoon depicting 
school employees as a school marm covering her mouth and exclaiming, "What have 
I done?! " as she watches an autocratic man representing the teachers' union 
tearing a paper with campaign promises as he says, "Promises? What promises? " 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Bennett launched a successful cartoon campaign to replace the 
teachers' union with a rival group to negotiate a new contract that would 
include lifetime health benefits. Under the current contract, health benefits 
end at age 65. In the cartoons, he characterized the union representing 
teachers at the time, the Culver City Federation of Teachers, as being asleep 
on the job. He also said it made false promises. 
</P>
<P>
But now Bennett is saying he was wrong to support the Culver City Teachers 
Assn., which had promised to negotiate for a 10% raise in salaries and lifetime 
health benefits. In October, teachers ratified a contract that included a 6% 
raise and an agreement to study the possibility of a new city property tax to 
pay for the health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that I am an old fool," Bennett told The Times this week. "I trusted 
and believed in people who sold us. I think the federation is still laughing 
and wanting to profit from the discomfort of the CTA, but I have no malice 
against either group." 
</P>
<P>
David Meilke, president of the ousted Federation of Teachers, said his members 
knew all along that the Teachers Assn. was not going to be able to deliver on 
all its promises. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the thing that irritated a lot of people was that after months of 
promises, they settled the new contract inside of a month," Meilke said of last 
October's contract ratification. "I'm happy to see that Howard now sees the 
light." 
</P>
<P>
Meilke said the association should have at least waited to see the outcome of 
Proposition 98, approved in November's general election, which establishes a 
minimum level of state funding for schools and requires excess state revenues 
to be used for education. 
</P>
<P>
Its specific effect on Culver City or any other district is not known, but it 
could mean additional money for some districts. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers Assn. President Bess Doerr said she was disappointed that Bennett has 
withdrawn his support for the federation. "I understand how he feels," she 
said. "But we did not promise that we would get lifetime benefits. It was more 
than a one-issue campaign last year." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to acknowledging his error, Bennett said he hopes his latest 
cartoon will remind teachers that their health benefits will still end at age 
65. He said union officials are now beginning negotiations for 1989-90 salary 
and benefits adjustments, and he said he hopes teachers will not ratify any 
changes without lifetime health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to really wake up the membership," Bennett said. "Let's all stick 
around and no one retire until all of us are given lifetime health coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett last fall formed his own group, School Employees' Assn. for Lifetime 
Health Coverage, to push the district into extending teachers' health benefits 
through the state Public Employees Retirement System, which does include 
lifetime coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett also hopes to wake up both the union's negotiators and Culver City 
Unified School District officials next week when he announces the winners of a 
contest he initiated to find money within the district's annual $18.5-million 
budget to pay for the health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Both district and union officials have said that the $300,000 needed annually 
to pay for increased health coverage is not available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found $2.4 Million 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett claims that his contest has found $2.4 million that could be used 
for increased health benefits without increasing the budget or cutting salaries 
or school programs. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett would not disclose where or how the money could be raised. He said the 
six winning ideas would be announced next Wednesday at 5 p.m. at the Culver 
City Veterans Memorial Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
(The winners will receive prizes, donated by merchants, ranging from a garbage 
disposal to a weekend trip to Las Vegas.) 
</P>
<P>
Meilke said that Bennett's contest could adversely affect the collective 
bargaining process, but "the issue of benefits transcends the concerns of union 
affiliations, so if Howard has found a way for us to obtain benefits, then we 
should listen to him." 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said she will not be able to attend Wednesday's meeting but said she 
hopes Bennett has found the money for the extended benefits. She said another 
representative of the federation would be present at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Villani, the assistant superintendent who handles negotiations for the 
school district, said he had no comment on the contest, and that he does not 
plan to attend the Wednesday announcement.

AUTHOR FINDS HOLOCAUST CHILDREN USED GAMES TO PLAY OUT THEIR FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC WILHELMUS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stripped of their innocence at an early age, Jewish children who were held 
prisoner in concentration camps and relocated to ghettos during World War II 
spent their few idle moments playing "Gas Chamber," "Gestapo Agent" and other 
games that reflected the horror of their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than play games that would help them escape their misery, these 
children, ages 2 to 14, often played games that mirrored their surroundings, 
said George Eisen, a Cal Poly Pomona physical education professor. He has 
written "Children and Play in the Holocaust," published by the University of 
Massachusetts Press. 
</P>
<P>
The book describes games played by Jewish children who lived in concentration 
camps, ghettos and in hiding during Germany's occupation of Europe. The Nazis 
systematically exterminated 6 million Jews, an estimated 1 million of them 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Eisen found that in Auschwitz, children played "Gas Chamber," during which they 
would imitate the screams of the people they heard being gassed to death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pretending to be Hitler 
</P>
<P>
In "Burial," they mimicked the mass burials conducted by the Germans. A few 
children would lie down and play dead, and others would roll them into shallow 
graves. In one variation of the game, a child pretended to be a dead Adolph 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Other games included "Doctor," in which a child would take food rations away 
from children pretending to be sick and refuse to help them without a bribe, 
and "Blockade," in which the children reenacted being sealed off from their 
families by German forces. 
</P>
<P>
The children also played "Blowing Up Bunkers," "Slaughter," and "Seizing the 
Clothes of the Dead." 
</P>
<P>
"Games in any culture are an important means to understanding reality," said 
Eisen, a Jewish native of Hungary whose field of study concerns the sociology 
of sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Playacting came to provide a naturally reflective mirror of all the sorrows, 
dismay and absurdity of the children's brief existence," Eisen says in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"This transcends the Holocaust," he said. "Mass exterminations have occurred in 
Beirut, Lebanon, Cambodia and Ireland. Where playing reflects the surroundings, 
where children have been traumatized, it means they will be traumatized in 
adult life as well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imitating What They Saw 
</P>
<P>
Eisen, who as a youth spent a year in hiding with his Jewish mother while his 
father was held prisoner in a concentration camp, said the children didn't 
necessarily play to have fun. Rather, they may have been imitating what they 
saw in an attempt to understand and cope with the atrocities surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
As their living conditions worsened and the children saw the murder of hundreds 
of their friends, relatives and acquaintances, the games increasingly became 
anti-German. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often it was hard to recruit a group of children willing to play the 
hated enemy, the German soldiers," writes Eisen. 
</P>
<P>
The repercussions of these games followed the children into adulthood, Eisen 
said. "They didn't necessarily go back to playing regular games after the war, 
and many had recurring nightmares and major emotional problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous source in the book says that because of her experiences in two 
concentration camps, "I don't even feel I know how to play and I found that 
it's a very big lack with my own children." 
</P>
<P>
Eisen said that although adults in the ghettos participated in games such as 
volleyball and track, they played for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
"The major difference between adults and children was that adults used games 
for escapist reasons," he said. "Adults have the power to rationalize their 
actions; children don't." 
</P>
<P>
Eisen was born in German-occupied Hungary in 1943. He has taught in Cal Poly 
Pomona's physical education department since 1979. He attended high school in 
Hungary, college in Israel and received a doctorate from the University of 
Maryland. While in Israel, he enlisted in the Jewish army. 
</P>
<P>
He got the idea for this book while researching organized Jewish sports in 
pre-World War 11 Europe for his doctorate degree. 
</P>
<P>
While working on his dissertation in 1979 on the social and political aspects 
of sports in Europe, Eisen came upon the diary of a Jewish ghetto resident. It 
questioned how the Jews could play games while they were being systematically 
exterminated. 
</P>
<P>
He mentally filed the topic away, and later spent three years traveling to 
Israel and Europe, visiting concentration camps and looking through archival 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Eisen said he was fascinated by the "coexistence of games and sport and mass 
murder, the ability of the the Jews to maintain life amidst death."

STANDOUT CENTER DOING WELL BUT BRUIN WOMEN NOT HITTING AS A TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molly Tideback, UCLA's 6-foot 3-inch freshman center from Waterloo, Iowa, is 
doing well this season. 
</P>
<P>
She leads the Bruins in scoring with an average of 13.6 points a game, in 
blocked shots with 12, in free-throw percentage (82%) and in field-goal 
percentage (47.3%). In addition, she set a school record by hitting 14 free 
throws against Pepperdine, and her 23 straight foul shots over three games just 
missed tying Denise Curry's school record of 24. 
</P>
<P>
That's very good for a freshman, but Tideback is not just any freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, women's basketball Coach Billie Moore was quoted as saying 
that she is the "type of player that can take your program to another level." 
</P>
<P>
Tideback's name is symbolic of the role she had been expected to play when she 
came to UCLA: help stem the tide of losses that has kept the Bruins out of 
postseason play since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't been happening. After defeating California and losing narrowly to 
Stanford last week, UCLA was 4-7 overall and 1-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that won't do the job if the Bruins expect to go to the NCAA 
playoffs. She said it will probably take a record of 19-9, maybe 18-10, to make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That means the Bruins, who play USC at 5:45 this evening at the Sports Arena, 
can afford to lose only a couple of their remaining 16 games. They won't be 
able to do that unless they start shooting better and Tideback stops fouling 
out of games. 
</P>
<P>
In the team's first nine games, the Bruins shot a dismal 37.4% from the field, 
and Tideback fouled out of three games and got in early foul trouble in a 
couple of others. She played only 22 minutes in a season-opening 67-60 loss to 
North Carolina and just 11 minutes in a 59-57 loss to Cincinnati. She played 17 
minutes and scored but 4 points when the Bruins were routed by top-ranked 
Tennessee, 82-50. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the team's "inability to put the ball in the basket" has been 
UCLA's chief problem and that "we've been our best opponent and our worst 
enemy. We've beaten ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the UCLA offense "is geared to get the ball inside to Molly." But 
she added that Tideback "hasn't shot enough" -- partly because foul trouble has 
cut down on her playing time, partly because she has felt "she is not shooting 
well." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and Tideback may be turning the corner. More will be learned about that 
against USC tonight. 
</P>
<P>
At home last week, the team's shooting improved to 41% in its 72-57 defeat of 
California and to 42.6% in a 73-71 loss to Stanford, ranked eighth nationally 
and a co-favorite with Washington to win the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Tideback, freshman guard DeDe Mosman and freshman forward Elaine Youngs, a 
starter this year for UCLA's 34-1 volleyball team, did not play against Cal. 
They were benched for the game for violating "a team rule, something minor," 
said Moore, who would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Tideback bounced back with a good game against Stanford. She didn't foul out 
and led the team with 10 rebounds and 20 points, including 12 of 13 from the 
foul line. 
</P>
<P>
She said she sometimes feels the pressure of being regarded as a savior of the 
UCLA program. "But I like a really big challenge," she said, "and now that 
conference play has started, it's time for me to really get started." 
</P>
<P>
She might not have faced such a stiff challenge if she had stayed home and 
played for the University of Iowa. She was a consensus prep All-American as a 
senior and all-state for four years. She averaged 28 points, 9 rebounds and 4 
blocked shots a game in 4 seasons at Columbus High in Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Iowa is willing to ship as much corn as possible to other states, 
but it didn't want to send Molly Tideback to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
She said that there was a lot of pressure on her to enroll at Iowa, where she 
and three other girls would have constituted "almost a whole team of Iowans." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother and stepfather also wanted her to play for the Hawkeyes and refused 
to sign her letter of intent to UCLA. She said her natural father finally 
signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that her mother and stepfather "didn't want me to go so far away. 
But right now my mom is accepting it more." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that when she saw that the situation was "kind of splitting the 
family and putting Molly in an uncomfortable position, we withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
"But she was emphatic that (going to UCLA) was what she wanted to do. I give 
her credit. She did it against difficult odds and she made it work. Not a lot 
of 16- or 17-year-olds would go against what their parents wanted them to do." 
</P>
<P>
Why was she so set on UCLA? Tideback said she has dreamed about playing for 
UCLA since she was about 9 and playing youth league basketball. She said she 
was probably influenced by Coach John Wooden's 10 NCAA championships with UCLA 
men's teams. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has had some difficulty adjusting to college basketball because 
"there is so much more thinking in the college game than in high school. I'm 
learning that for sure." 
</P>
<P>
She added that there is also a vast leap in talent between high school and 
college. "When you played against big girls in high school they were usually 
slow; in college, everyone is big -- and good. Now I'm playing against players 
</P>
<P>
who are as big as I am; in high school, they were just big." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has had a losing record, she said, because of "turnovers, a lack of 
scoring and because I need to bring up my game. Our main problem is that we're 
not putting the ball in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the Bruins also might be doing better "if I could play a whole 
game," if she didn't get in early foul trouble and have to come out, or if she 
didn't foul out so much. 
</P>
<P>
"They're usually stupid fouls, but I'm getting better at it, though." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that in her first nine games Tideback "has been able to play barely 
half a game when she hasn't been in foul trouble" and that "she can't be 
effective" if she doesn't play enough. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Tideback usually picks up one or two "foolish fouls" and one or 
two that possibly should have been called against an opponent. "It takes a lot 
of experience and maturity to (avoid fouling) without changing your game. . . . 
It's a matter of learning to get in the right position. (She picks up some 
fouls) because she's aggressive and takes the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"She has the capability of being one of the top freshman in the conference and 
in the country. I don't think she's really had the opportunity to show her 
ability consistently because she hasn't played enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We need her on the floor to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
The kind of success that Moore and her Bruins would like may have to wait until 
next year. Injuries against Cal last week to junior center Sheri Bouldin and 
freshman guard Michelle Miles, who has been starting, may dictate the 
postponement of NCAA Tournament hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Bouldin, who dislocated her left shoulder, is expected to be out for at least 
four weeks. Miles, who received a concussion and sprained her neck, is to be 
re-examined by doctors this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have to get it together," said Tideback, "or it will be a very 
rough road. Some people accept losing, but I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said her players believe they can have a successful second season in 
conference play. "That's half the battle," she said. "The other half is getting 
out there and doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that mentally we are gaining confidence. We have a new life, a second 
chance. One benefits by being in a conference. We're sure going to give it our 
best run."

Eastern Airlines, seeking to raise cash, has sold six A-300 wide-body jets to 
sister carrier Continental Airlines, the company announced. Eastern will 
receive $103 million in cash and a $67-million note at 17.5% interest for the 
sale, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said in Miami. The planes had been 
leased earlier to Continental and therefore will have no effect on the size of 
Eastern's fleet, she said. Ceremsak said the sale was unconnected to the 
breakdown Monday of federally mediated talks between Eastern and its machinists 
union.

ROCKWELL, EATON UNIT CANCEL DEAL OVER EQUIPMENT GLITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement for Rockwell International Corp. to buy the Eaton Corp. subsidiary 
that makes electronic defensive gear for Rockwell's B-1B bomber has been 
canceled because of development problems with the equipment, the companies 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also disclosed that it has been hired by Eaton to help work out the 
bugs in the so-called electronic countermeasures system, which is designed to 
help protect the high-tech supersonic bomber that Rockwell makes for the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo-based Rockwell announced last month that it had reached an agreement 
in principle to buy AIL Systems Inc. of Deer Park, N.Y., a subsidiary of Eaton 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Reconsider 
</P>
<P>
The deal was canceled, the companies said in a joint announcement, because of 
uncertainty about AIL's contract to produce the ALQ-161 electronic 
countermeasures system for the Air Force. No price was ever disclosed, but some 
industry analysts put AIL's value at $350 million to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
If bugs in the program are ironed out and the contract stabilized, Rockwell 
would reconsider the purchase, said Rockwell spokesman William Mellon. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, prime contractor on the B-1B, delivered the last of the $280-million 
planes to the Air Force in April. The Air Force has said that the bomber is 
fully operational, but critics in Congress say its ability to perform in battle 
would be hampered by flaws in the countermeasures system designed to befuddle 
enemy radar and other electronic gear. 
</P>
<P>
AIL built the electronics gear under a $3.5-billion contract and has offered to 
remedy its flaws for $520 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4,400 Employees 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement was the first public indication that Rockwell would 
take part in making the fixes. Spokesman Mellon wouldn't reveal Rockwell's 
exact role in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland-based Eaton, a maker of automotive and electronics products, has had 
AIL up for sale for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
AIL, with 4,400 employees, has headquarters in the Long Island city of Deer 
Park and factories at Hauppage and Melville, N.Y., and in Westlake Village.

FOR THE RECORD

An Associated Press article in Thursday's Business section said Rockwell 
International broke off its agreement to buy the AIL subsidiary of Eaton Corp. 
because of "development problems" with electronic warfare equipment of the B-1B 
bomber. Rockwell said Thursday that the story was incorrect, that Rockwell had 
decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of "an absence of 
definitive contracts with the U.S. Air Force on all aspects of AIL work on the 
B-1B."

REAGAN AGAIN PUSHES NAVAL OIL RESERVE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan is making one last stab at selling off the Naval Petroleum 
Reserve, telling Congress to unload it or else. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of trying unsuccessfully to persuade Congress that the 
government should get out of the oil business, Reagan in his final budget this 
week tied the sale of the reserves to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"He is telling Congress that if they don't sell (the Naval Petroleum Reserve), 
they had better find the money somewhere else to fill up the SPR," said a 
congressional staffer. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan proposal will be endorsed by President-elect George Bush when he 
takes over later this month, Administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House plan calls for the sale in fiscal year 1990 of the Naval 
Petroleum Reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo., for a bonus 
payment of $1 billion. Under the proposed terms, the purchaser would be 
required to deliver 50,000 barrels per day for five years to the SPR salt domes 
along the Gulf Coast. Additionally, the buyer would also have to provide 10 
million barrels of oil to a newly established Defense Petroleum Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underground Caverns 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the sale, national preparedness will be enhanced due to the 
establishment of the Defense Petroleum Inventory and the increased oil provided 
for the strategic reserve," according to Reagan's budget message to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress balks at selling off the naval reserves, so-called because they 
were established to keep Navy ships in fuel in case of emergencies, the SPR 
would be filled at a rate of only 22,000 barrels a day in fiscal 1990 under 
Reagan's proposal since the Energy Department would be given only $127 million 
to spend for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress agrees to the sale, the fill rate would be 72,000 barrels per day, 
which would mean that the planned inventory of 750 million barrels would be 
reached early in fiscal year 1996, along with the ability to distribute 4.5 
million barrels a day to the national pipeline system. 
</P>
<P>
Started in 1975 as a hedge against supply disruptions, the six underground salt 
caverns along the Gulf Coast now hold some 550 million barrels. The Energy 
Department contracted with the Mexican state oil company, Pemex, to provide 
78,000 barrels a day in fiscal year 1989 for about $242 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this is much more palatable to Congress," said Deputy Energy 
Secretary Joseph Salgado. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the outgoing Administration persists in trying to sell Congress on 
the idea after years of rejection, Salgado said: "It's because we think it's 
the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration from the start has wanted to sell the naval reserves, 
arguing that the private sector could operate it more efficiently and that it 
would help in reducing the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress, backed by a reluctant Navy, has never warmed to the idea of 
selling off a national asset. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming Bush Administration agrees with the sale proposal, transition team 
officials say, so it could become an issue in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Barter System' 
</P>
<P>
"They have improved the salability," said a House staff member who has tracked 
the proposal for the past eight years. "For years, the objections to selling it 
off has been mainly that you should not unload something without replacing it 
with something of value. 
</P>
<P>
"They have dropped the idea of just getting some cash and gone back to the 
barter system," he said. "It's a creative move and if Bush really pushes it, it 
just might work." 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials say that even if Congress approves the sale, it 
would take some time before oil companies would be able to bid on it. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, studied the 
issue and said a major problem in putting the reserves on the market is that 
the government has no solid idea on how much oil is in the ground, an essential 
point in any planned sale. 
</P>
<P>
Production at both Elk Hills and Teapot Dome is about 50,000 barrels per day 
combined but could be raised to about 100,000 barrels per day, government 
officials say.

Ford Motor Co. fired the first round in what could be a new auto incentives 
war, announcing that it was offering 4.9% financing programs on four small car 
and truck models as well as rebates of up to $3,000 for some 1988 model cars. 
Analysts said the action reflects growing buyer concern about rising interest 
rates and could trigger other cut-rate financing programs. Ford said it is 
offering the 4.9% rate on 24-month loans on its 1989 Ford Escort and Festiva 
small cars, Mercury Tracer subcompact and the Ford Ranger small truck. It is 
offering a 3.9% financing rate on Tracer models sold in California.

A plan to revive steam train passenger service to the Grand Canyon has won 
tentative approval from the National Park Service, provided its operators can 
show that it will reduce automobile traffic. Grand Canyon Railway earlier in 
the week said it plans to establish service over the 64 miles between Grand 
Canyon Village on the south rim and Williams, a town of 2,400 people near 
Flagstaff, Ariz. The line was built in 1901, but passenger service was halted 
in 1968. The Park Service says it supports restoration of train service because 
it might help reduce automobile traffic at Grand Canyon National Park.

KOHL CALLS FOR SOLUTIONS TO BEEF CONFLICT

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday called for a reasonable 
solution to a trade dispute between the Economic Community and the United 
States over a ban on the imports of American hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should resolve their problems in a reasonable way in the spirit of 
transatlantic partnership and aware of their responsibility for the world 
economy," Kohl told reporters at a news conference in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
The EC ban on U.S. beef produced from cattle that had been fed growth hormones 
took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The United States retaliated with punitive tariffs on several European 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"Such trade conflicts can only hurt both sides economically and politically," 
Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
He said such disputes give a "completely false signal" for a meeting of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will be held in April and for the 
world economic summit scheduled this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl did not suggest any solutions to the beef dispute. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged strong support for the 12 European nations' efforts to forge a 
single European market by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached the point of no return; the target date will be met," Kohl said, 
adding that West Germany will make every effort to assist Spain and France, 
which hold the rotating EC presidency this year, in pushing through important 
decisions that must be made.

Share prices rose to a record close for the third consecutive day Wednesday on 
continued optimism at the start of a new imperial era.

declines.

"People are thinking brokers will come out with new sales campaigns for the new 
era," said Jeff Bahrenburg, a market strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"That will give the market, over the next month, an upward bias of about 10%," 
he said.

The sudden surge brought in some profit takers this morning, bringing the index 
down 102.63 to the day's low of 30,903.88.

GLUT OF GLOVES PUTS SQUEEZE ON MEDICAL SUPPLIER'S PROFIT

A medical supplier that profited from an AIDS-induced shortage of latex rubber 
gloves says it expects to report a big loss because a glove glut has emerged, 
leaving it with mountains of unsold merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have millions of gloves -- and more arriving," said John Murray, vice 
president for finance at Moore Medical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Moore Medical Corp. had profits of more than $4 million a year in 1986 and 1987 
and pretax earnings of $3.1 million in the first three quarters of 1988, but it 
has alerted stockholders to brace for a loss in the final quarter and for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said a one-time charge in the fourth quarter would be in the range 
of $7 million to $11 million, or $4.3 million to $6.8 million on an after-tax 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's situation is typical of that of many medical supply firms. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity about coming in contact with AIDS-contaminated bodily fluids created 
an unprecedented demand for the gloves last year. By spring, Moore Medical and 
other distributors were rationing gloves to customers at a few boxes per order. 
</P>
<P>
"We doubled and tripled up on orders to suppliers," Murray said. But then 
supplies from new factories in Asia began arriving. By late fall, he said, "all 
of a sudden a lot of our orders were coming in (and) what had been close to 
zero supply became a glut."

Household International Inc. said Wednesday that it would dissolve its 
$1-billion manufacturing empire, narrowing the company's operations to 
financial services after four years of restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it would spin off three of its manufacturing units to its 
shareholders, creating three independent companies, and sell the other six, 
which include Thermos Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company will be left with four financial-services operations: Household 
Finance Corp., Household Bank, Household Commercial Finance and Alexander 
Hamilton Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
Household said in a statement that it would use the proceeds from the 
transactions to reduce its $500-million debt by about $255 million and pump 
about $95 million into its financial services operations. 
</P>
<P>
"These actions are intended to create more focused entities and should increase 
the value of Household shareholders' investment," Chairman Donald C. Clark said 
in a statement. "The actions represent a logical next step to several years of 
restructuring in a continuing effort to maximize shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thermos Co. on Block 
</P>
<P>
The three independent companies to be created are Eljer Industries Inc., a 
building products company with anticipated 1988 sales of more than $400 
million; Schwitzer Inc., a maker of engine parts with anticipated 1988 sales of 
$140 million, and Scotsman Industries Inc., a manufacturer of commercial 
refrigeration products with anticipated 1988 sales of $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
Household said it was considering a tax-free distribution of one new share in 
each of the three spun-off units for every five shares of Household's common 
stock. The spinoffs are expected to occur on or about April 15, Household said. 
</P>
<P>
The units to be sold are: Thermos Co., the well-known maker of insulated 
products for storing and serving food; GC-Thorsen, a marketer of entertainment 
accessories and hand tools; Albion Industries, a leading manufacturer of 
heavy-duty casters; King-Sealey, a major supplier of cooking-appliance 
controls; Omni Products International, a furniture maker, and WaterTest Corp., 
a provider of water-testing services for consumer and commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The combined 1988 sales of the six units to be sold are expected to total about 
$300 million, Household said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which is based in this northwest Chicago suburb, said it expected 
to receive "well in excess" of $120 million for the six units. Household also 
said it would be repaid funds borrowed by the divisions to be spun off. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Household's exit from manufacturing was not surprising, 
considering the company's sale in 1985 of its Household Merchandising 
subsidiary (a chain of supermarket, discount, hardware and variety stores) and 
of National Car Rental a year later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cyclical Influence' 
</P>
<P>
"If you had read between the lines, their strategic emphasis on the financial 
side of the business probably would have led you to this conclusion," said 
Frederick Wightman, vice president of research with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Wightman said investors perceived manufacturing as having a "cyclical 
influence" on Household's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyclical earnings are not valued as highly as steady earnings," he said. "If 
Household can remove the cyclical component and retain the fairly stable 
financial component, this will enable them to realize a higher multiple (or 
price-to-earnings ratio) on their stock," and thus attract more investors.

Coca-Cola is about to be removed from the Arab League blacklist for dealing 
with Israel and plans to open bottling plants throughout the Persian Gulf, a 
company official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plans to open bottling plants throughout the gulf," said Peter 
Beaumont. He would not release details on the number of plants involved or say 
when they will open. 
</P>
<P>
In Syria's capital of Damascus, where the official boycott committee met 
Wednesday, one participant acknowledged that the Coca-Cola issue was discussed 
but refused to confirm that the U.S. conglomerate was off the blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott office, based in Damascus and an arm of the 22-nation Arab League, 
put the soft drink maker on the list 21 years ago because it did business with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola bottling plants are being built in Bahrain and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola also is on supermarket shelves in the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar and 
Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, the latest edition of the kingdom's official register 
said the company and its products were no longer on the Arab boycott list. 
</P>
<P>
Carbonated drinks are popular in the arid Gulf where the summer temperatures 
soar in the vicinity of 122 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish all our items sold as well," said a supermarket manager in Riyadh, 
explaining that almost all of the 200 cases of Coke he just received have sold 
out within a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Olayan Co. of Saudi Arabia received permission to distribute the soft drink 
in a market that is dominated by Pepsi, Coke's traditional rival.

UP TO 200 ACRES BURN IN TRABUCO CANYON FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
WIND-DRIVEN BLAZE CONTAINED BUT FIREFIGHTERS MAINTAIN VIGIL; HOMES, LIVESTOCK 
THREATENED 
</P>

More than 200 firefighters from throughout Orange County converged on the 
Trabuco Canyon area late Wednesday night to battle a 200-acre brush fire that 
threatened homes and livestock, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No structures had burned by late Wednesday night, but firefighters remained on 
alert throughout the night as dry Santa Ana winds swept through the canyon 
area. Flames briefly threatened the Joplin Youth Center, a county home for boys 
at the end of Rose Canyon, near the Cleveland National Forest, County Fire 
Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which reportedly was sparked by a downed power line, started 
somewhere in the hills between Live Oak Canyon Road and Rose Canyon Road. It 
was whipped by winds gusting to 80 m.p.h. and was contained at about 200 acres 
at 10:10 p.m. Wednesday, Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hugh Madlock said. 
</P>
<P>
"This fire could pick up again," Madlock said. "We still have some hot spots 
within the control zone. . . . If embers start flying, we could have real 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Madlock said the first report of the fire came at 8:22 p.m. Because of the 
severe winds, all available crews and equipment were summoned. 
</P>
<P>
"This has got everybody out of bed tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary O'Neal, one of two owners of Senor Lico's restaurant, 20722 Rose Canyon 
Road, said 20 to 30 diners were in the restaurant about 8:30 p.m. when fire 
officials came in and told them all to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea there was a fire until we saw the first fire truck going up the 
street, and then we could smell it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned "right across the street from the restaurant" about 75 feet 
away, but by 10:30 p.m., O'Neal said it looked "like it's pretty well 
contained. They have over 100 firefighters here going house to house just 
putting out embers." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said about two dozen residents of the canyon area came to his restaurant 
and were awaiting word from fire officials allowing them to return to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department told us it was caused by a downed electrical line that 
started an old house on fire, up Rose Canyon Road on Ferber Ranch," O'Neal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Madlock said the official cause of the brush fire had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters made an early stand around the Joplin Youth Center, a county 
facility for boys that are wards of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Joplin was threatened for a while, but there is no structural damage so far," 
Madlock said. "We were at one time going to evacuate, but we sent 10 engine 
companies up there to protect" it. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the blaze, 50 engine companies and more than 150 firefighters 
and two bulldozers were on the scene, led by five battalion chiefs and three 
commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Madlock said calls for immediate aid were put out throughout the county 
"because of the potential. We have a canyon that is small, with old homes on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We had, at the time of the fire, 75-m.p.h. winds and had a potential to burn 
basically the whole town of Trabuco, which has approximately 400 residents. 
Probably 75 homes were threatened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Madlock said the first report was of 10 acres burning "and the fire was moving 
out fast, with winds at 60 m.p.h. and gusts to 75 to 80 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said many residents evacuated without prompting from 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have a problem with horses," Madlock said. "At one time, 16 horses were 
running around. People thought they would be safer if they were let free." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Keener, manager of Cook's Corner at Live Oak Canyon and El Toro Canyon 
roads, said residents who came to the restaurant told her that flames appeared 
to come as close as 50 feet to some homes. 
</P>
<P>
Keener said she went to her house to pick up her dogs, which she locked in her 
car. She said the restaurant would stay open throughout the night to shelter 
any evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind is coming through these mountains, and the fire seemed to bounce off 
of one mountain, then switch to another," Keener said. "That was the scary 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Emory, owner of Emory's Country Store at Trabuco Oaks Drive and Trabuco 
Canyon Road, said his son telephoned him at the store to alert him to the 
blaze, which was burning at the ridge top, near the boys home. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 acres of dry brush is behind his home, Emory said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire "was starting to crest the hill pretty fast," Emory said. "It came 
down the ridge real fast and down toward the creek." 
</P>
<P>
Once word of the fire spread through the rural community, "everybody here was 
gathering their goods" to get out, Emory said. And because of the high winds, 
they also feared for their horses and brought them to Trabuco Elementary 
School, which residents say is a 110-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
Emory said the fire came down to about 300 feet from Hickey Creek, a tributary 
of Trabuco Creek. "Everybody feared it would jump the creek," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Fire Battalion Chief Capt. John Cox said that by 11:30 p.m., winds had 
calmed to 25 to 30 m.p.h. with occasional gusts of 35 to 40 m.p.h. When his 
crew arrived shortly after the fire started, winds were about 50 to 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the red glow of the flames when we got here," Cox said. "It was 
still real active." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Young, a Coto de Caza mechanic and resident of Trabuco Canyon, said he was 
home when the fire started shortly before 8:30 p.m. Young said it looked as 
though the whole hillside was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the flames coming off the hill. It was an awesome sight," said Young, 
who has lived in the canyon for 15 years. "I sent my wife and two kids out. . . 
. We were lucky, because the wind was heading out of the canyon. It looked like 
it was heading to" Joplin Youth Center.

PROPOSED SLASHES IN HEALTH CARE SOUND A GRIM NOTE IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health-care programs for thousands of poor, disabled and elderly Orange County 
residents would be significantly curtailed if the $47.8-billion state budget 
proposed this week by Gov. George Deukmejian is enacted as written, county 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pretty picture from the standpoint of health care," said Ronald R. 
Di Luigi, assistant director of the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the governor's blueprint to cut $485 million from health and 
welfare services in the state's 1989-90 budget are county programs serving 
low-income families and the medically indigent. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Deukmejian's recommendation to withhold cost-of-living increases 
for recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children would affect 55,000 
county residents, many of them single, unemployed women with children. The 
maximum grant the welfare program currently provides a family of three -- a 
mother and two children -- is $663 a month. The cost-of-living increase would 
have provided the family with another $32 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"To the average individual, that may not seem like much, but to a single mother 
trying to cope with the county's high cost of living, $32 is significant," said 
Bob Griffith, chief deputy director of the county's Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget proposals will go through months of legislative hearings 
before they are returned to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
But initial reactions among county officials to the proposed health and welfare 
cuts unveiled on Tuesday were gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
John Sibley, assistant county administrative officer, said the governor's 
proposed budget would further strain the county's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly good news in light of our situation," Sibley said in referring to 
the county's own budget troubles. In recent days, the Board of Supervisors 
reached funding agreements with the County Employees Retirement Board and 
county judges that are expected to bail it out of a budget crisis. But the 
picture still is not bright. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in past years, Sibley said, it would be difficult to absorb the proposed 
health and welfare spending cuts because of the county's own fiscal problems. 
Yet by law, the county must provide a certain level of service for the poor and 
disadvantaged -- something that the county has succeeded in doing by using 
large amounts of federal money. But this year, Sibley said, is a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"Our opportunities to match funding shortfalls (are) very limited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley and other county officials said that the cuts were not altogether 
surprising. The passage of Proposition 98, approved by voters last year, 
required Deukmejian to provide additional money for education. To comply, 
Griffith said, health care and welfare programs were likely targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anticipating this," Griffith said. "Welfare and health programs are 
big-ticket items. We knew we were going to get hit . . . but that doesn't make 
it any easier." 
</P>
<P>
A key component of the Deukmejian package is a $63.9-million spending reduction 
for in-home nursing care services provided to low-income elderly and disabled 
people. About 4,500 county residents receive assistance under the program. It 
is designed to keep elderly and disabled people out of nursing homes and other 
such institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients are given help with such tasks as cleaning, cooking and shopping. 
The governor recommended that payment for such services be restricted to 70 
hours a month; county residents are now receiving payments that cover care for 
an average of 79 hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith estimated that the governor's proposal would reduce payments under the 
program from $335 to $297 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed cuts in the state's funding for programs for the medically indigent 
could affect 12,000 county residents who currently receive free or heavily 
subsidized hospital and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian proposed replacing some of that money with funds from a November 
ballot measure that enacted a 25-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes. But 
Di Luigi said that using Proposition 99 revenue to offset spending cuts is 
"disappointing." Many health-care providers had hoped that money would be used 
to expand medical care for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 99 revenues offered the first real sign of daylight in our 
attempts to provide adequate health care for those people," Di Luigi said. "It 
was a rare chance to improve our level of service. The governor is simply 
suggesting we shuffle dollars around."

Sid Vicious, an 8-foot boa constrictor best known at Mission Viejo High School 
for devouring rats whole, will teach students and medical experts a new lesson 
today, when he undergoes an experimental laser treatment for cancer of the 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
For veterinarians, the procedure will be a landmark in the care of cold-blooded 
creatures and could provide data applicable to humans. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what will happen, but we're willing to give it a try," said 
Michael Berns, director of UC Irvine's Beckman Laser Institute, where the 
procedure will be performed. "We're just going to see if we can help the animal 
and not get eaten in the process."

For students, who discovered the malignant tumor on the classroom pet's lower 
jaw 6 weeks ago, "it's interesting and gross," said Rich Meyer, a 16-year-old 
biology student. 
</P>
<P>
Sid, a mild-mannered South American boa who doesn't live up to his notorious 
punk-rock-star namesake, was injected Wednesday with a light-sensitive dye. He 
will be anesthetized today for the treatment, in which a laser will be used to 
"excite" the dye, causing it to release compounds that are toxic to the 
surrounding cancer cells. The treatment is valuable because it allows the 
selective destruction of tumors without damaging healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the laser procedure has been approved for humans, the dye to be used 
today -- phthallocynanine -- is still experimental, Berns said. In treatment of 
dogs, cats and other mammals at the Beckman Institute, it has worked more 
effectively than other light-sensitive dyes. 
</P>
<P>
But the dye has never been tried on a reptile. Plans to treat a 500-pound 
desert tortoise were dropped recently because no one could figure out how to 
transport the turtle, according to Berns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first non-legged patient," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Sid slithered his way into the experimental treatment with the help of Dr. 
Steve Weldy, a veterinarian who specializes in exotic animals. Weldy, a 1975 
Mission Viejo High graduate who treats classroom animals there for free, is 
also a consulting veterinarian for UC Irvine's biological sciences department. 
He will assist in the procedure, to be performed by Dr. Mary Kay Klein, a 
veterinary oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
Because the process is experimental, there will be no charge for Sid's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Weldy sees the potential scientific value of learning to help humans by first 
treating animals. But as former president of Mission Viejo High School's 
Herpetology Club, he also views the cool creature with a touch of warmth. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance to save this snake that deserves to live," Weldy said. "And 
emotionally, it means a lot to the school and all the students there." 
</P>
<P>
Sid seemed quite underwhelmed. He was moved Tuesday from the glass cage that he 
shares with his 6-foot mate in Emmett Carlson's biology classroom to an 
aquarium in Weldy's office. There his unlikely neighbors were Charlie, an 
uninterested white cat, and Addie, a very interested terrier. 
</P>
<P>
"Snakes are pretty mellow," explained Carlson, who let Sid curl around his 
shoulders as he spoke. "The only time they move is when they're hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Students in Carlson's classes have followed each step of Sid's treatment, from 
a biopsy that diagnosed the malignant carcinoma to later surgery to remove the 
tumor. They also learned that all the cancer could not be removed and that, 
without further treatment, the tumor would return and eventually kill their 
reptilian pet. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just biology -- it has been a lesson in life. If the procedure is 
successful, Sid, now about 8 years old, could live to the age of 15 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will pull through," said student Chris Currie, 15. "We handle the 
snakes -- they feel really weird. But you get to care about them."

SOUTH COUNTY PROPOSALS; 
</P>
<P>
POLARIZATION MARKS ANNEXATION DEBATES 
</P>

<P>
Nick Ugrin and Wallace Bjornson live within the same walled confines of the 
sprawling Leisure World retirement complex in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they were on opposite sides Wednesday at an acrimonious public hearing on 
south Orange County cityhood issues. Ugrin, president of the governing 
foundation of the retirement community of 21,000 residents, testified in favor 
of a merger with the proposed city of Laguna Hills; Bjornson threw cold water 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Heyes and Ron Kennedy also are neighbors, in Aegean Hills. But they, 
too, disagreed over the proposed annexation of their unincorporated community 
by the city of Mission Viejo. Kennedy said he favors immediate annexation; 
Heyes is dead set against it. 
</P>
<P>
These disagreements typified the polarization among more than 100 south Orange 
County residents who crowded into a 3-hour hearing Wednesday before the 
county's Local Agency Formation Commission. It was the second hearing in a year 
set by LAFCO to air assorted cityhood drives and annexation efforts that have 
entangled unincorporated south county areas in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking his head in exasperation, LAFCO Commissioner Don R. Roth said 
afterward: "I think we got the full load today. It was like the preacher giving 
nine sermons on the same Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
In all, six proposals were pitched Wednesday to the five-member commission, 
which reviews annexation and incorporation proposals and decides whether they 
can go forward or be put to a vote of residents. 
</P>
<P>
Among the annexation or cityhood plans were: 
</P>
<P>
* Combining the 21,000 residents of Leisure World with about 24,000 residents 
in surrounding neighborhoods to form a city of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* Incorporating Laguna Niguel as a city that eventually would have more than 
60,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
* Merging Laguna Niguel and Laguna Hills into one super-city, a suggestion by 
the LAFCO staff. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing the city of Mission Viejo -- with its 68,000 residents -- to annex 
Aegean Hills, a community of 7,000 adjoining the city, which became 
incorporated only last March. 
</P>
<P>
* Considering eventual cityhood for the El Toro-Lake Forest area by endorsing 
the two adjoining communities' creation of a Municipal Advisory Council and 
then a Community Services District. Those steps are a prelude to incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing the city of San Clemente to claim 11,000 acres of rural land within 
its sphere of influence, a step that would precede annexation. 
</P>
<P>
While the Aegean Hills annexation plan involved a relatively small number of 
residents, it sparked the most debate and controversy at Wednesday's hearing. 
The five-member Mission Viejo City Council has voted unanimously to pursue the 
annexation. LAFCO is to consider the Aegean Hills matter at a separate hearing 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Mission Viejo Co., developer of the planned community of 
Mission Viejo, adamantly opposed the annexation, as did a number of Mission 
Viejo residents, on grounds the community's master design was not intended to 
include adjoining neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burden for City 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not dilute the planned community," said John Ben, vice chairman of the 
Citizens' Action Committee of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Driskill, chairwoman of the committee, said many residents also object to 
the annexation request because it would prove too burdensome for the new city. 
Driskill said the city is having trouble even putting a staff in place, adding 
that the new government has lost a city manager and has 16 unfilled staff 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing in favor of the annexation plan were Kennedy and James Burns, Aegean 
Hills residents and members of the Citizens to Unify Mission Viejo, which first 
applied for annexation a year ago. The annexation request was tabled by LAFCO 
pending an election Nov. 8 to determine the outcome of a proposed city of 
Saddleback Valley. Both Aegean Hills and Laguna Hills were part of that 
cityhood proposal, which went down to defeat by a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do it now?" Burns asked rhetorically of the Aegean Hills annexation 
request. "Because we've waited and it's our turn." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a city of Laguna Hills told LAFCO members that they, too, had 
waited patiently for the outcome of valleywide cityhood and that it was their 
turn for consideration as well. LAFCO is to take up the question of cityhood 
for Laguna Hills at a Jan. 25 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Failure of the valleywide incorporation effort "was an overwhelming defeat of 
the larger city," said Alan Songstad, a Laguna Hills lawyer who is leading the 
drive to form a city of Laguna Hills. "Now we are the only proposal involving 
this area." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills cityhood plan also spurred controversy beyond the boundaries 
of Leisure World. Some residents of neighboring El Toro complained that a new 
city would siphon off lucrative tax revenue from the Laguna Hills Mall, even 
though the mall draws customers from the entire region, including El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Staff Proposal 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO staff members acknowledged that creation of new cities such as Laguna 
Hills could divert revenue from nearby unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to address that concern, LAFCO Executive Officer Jim Colangelo 
submitted a report to commission members earlier Wednesday urging them to 
consider incorporation of a much larger area than Laguna Hills, suggesting a 
merger of Laguna Hills with Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Such a merger, Colangelo said, would more equitably distribute the south 
county's tax revenue. He noted that Laguna Hills' proposal includes about 36% 
of the unincorporated south county's population, but about 50% of the area's 
sales tax and hotel bed tax revenue. In contrast, he said, Laguna Niguel 
cityhood would include about 19% of the area's residents and 15% of the 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, though, Colangelo said Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel consist of 55% 
of the residents and 64% of the revenue of the area. With Laguna Niguel 
projected to continue growing in population, Colangelo predicted the two 
communities eventually would become closer in population. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of these two areas would represent a more equitable 
distribution of revenues than would either of these proposals by themselves," 
Colangelo said in his report to the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
However, Laguna Niguel and Laguna Hills cityhood leaders maintained that such a 
merger would not work because the communities have totally separate identities. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Krembas, president of the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, also 
told LAFCO that his community has had its cityhood request -- submitted in 
December, 1986 -- postponed long enough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's Dreams 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Laguna Niguel has battled neighboring Dana Point over a tax-rich 
coastal strip. Dana Point eventually won in court. At a November town hall 
meeting, however, more than 500 Laguna Niguel residents voted overwhelmingly to 
pursue cityhood with or without the coastal strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Niguel has dreams," Krembas said. "You must now concur that it is time 
to let our citizens get on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO on Wednesday set a Feb. 15 meeting to consider the Laguna Niguel request. 
</P>
<P>
After the public testimony ended, the LAFCO commissioners took no action, but 
expressed a willingness to press on with the incorporation and annexation 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is time to move ahead with the future of south Orange County," said 
Commissioner Donald A. Holt Jr., who is leaving LAFCO later this year to move 
to Chicago.

ANAHEIM HILLS HOME HEIGHT LIMIT MAY RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 25-foot height limit on homes in the posh Anaheim Hills area would be 
raised to 30 feet for turrets, cupolas and other ornamental roof toppings under 
an ordinance proposed this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, still to be drafted by the city attorney's office, up to 
10% of the length of a home's roof line could be raised to 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In Hidden Canyon and an adjacent tract area, the limit would be 35 feet. Only 
uninhabitable architectural features would be allowed, and homeowners could 
still ask the city for variances, Mayor Fred Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure must still return to the City Council for approval. A date for that 
vote has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change follows numerous height variance requests from homeowners, 
most of which have been granted in recent years. Some residents have objected 
to the number of granted variances. Others, who favor greater heights, sought a 
more generous ordinance so that they would not have to seek variances. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-foot limit applies only to the "scenic corridor" area of Anaheim Hills, 
a demarcation established in 1971 to preserve the rural character of the hills.

<P>
CONVICTION UPHELD IN ILLEGAL EXPORT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court has affirmed the 1987 conviction of a Costa Mesa man 
for attempting to export technical military manuals to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th District U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena also upheld Posey's 
4-month prison term and $12,000 fine for trying to illegally export manuals on 
jet and transport aircraft engines. 
</P>
<P>
Through Newport Aeronautical Sales, Posey bought nonclassified military manuals 
from the government and sold them to prospective government contractors. His 
lawyers claimed that because the information he was attempting to sell was in 
the public domain under the Freedom of Information Act, his conviction should 
be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
But in an opinion written by Judge William A. Norris and issued this week, the 
court held that the government has the power to restrict the export of 
information that is already available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Posey's associate, Edward Bush of Agoura, was arrested 2 years ago as he 
attempted to board a plane to South Africa with three cases of manuals. He was 
convicted of violation of the Arms Export Control Act and sentenced to 3 years' 
probation.

KOREANS HOPE TO RAISE $130,000 FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Korean-American Assn. has begun a drive to raise $130,000 to 
establish a Korean senior citizen center. 
</P>
<P>
H. Andrew Kim, an association spokesman, said the organization recently 
received a $5,000 grant from Pacific Bell to pay such fund-raising expenses as 
postage and printing of information sent to Korean households in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
The group, established in 1987, plans to locate the senior center in a building 
bought by the association, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to help repay a $130,000 mortgage on the building at 9888 Garden 
Grove Blvd., which is now being shared by the association and Korean senior 
citizens, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The association eventually wants to move out so we can put the elderly center 
in there, because the facility is too small to handle both groups," Kim said.

ASTHMATIC JAIL INMATE WHO DIED IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Jail inmate who died at UCI Medical Center in Orange was 
identified as a Santa Ana resident, Sheriff's Department officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anniele Gillian, 37, had been arrested by Santa Ana police on Jan. 4 on 
suspicion of possession of narcotics. She was taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange Monday night after she experienced difficulty breathing, Sheriff's Lt. 
Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
When Gillian was booked into the jail, a physician determined that she had 
acute asthma and placed her in the jail's infirmary for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Gillian began having difficulty breathing and the medical staff gave her 
medication, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she suffered another asthma attack about 10:45 p.m. and the jail 
physician ordered her sent to UCI Medical Center for further evaluation and 
treatment, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
She arrived at the medical center's trauma room at 12:20 a.m. Tuesday and died 
less than 2 hours later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation is under way, and an autopsy is pending.

RITES SCHEDULED TODAY FOR PLANE CRASH VICTIM BARBARA GELLMAN 
</P>

<P>
Services will be held today for Barbara L. Gellman, who died when her 
twin-engine plane crashed into a fog-covered ridge Monday in Alameda County. 
</P>
<P>
Although a positive identification is pending, "there's no doubt who it was," 
said Irwin F. Gellman, her husband. "I wish there were. It was her plane. The 
only person who flew my wife's plane was my wife." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot of the 
Cessna was warned three times that she was flying too low. The plane 
disappeared from the radar screen of air traffic controllers and crashed at 
11:25 a.m., Alameda County Deputy Sheriff Louis Lozano Jr. said. The FAA is 
investigating the crash. "Why she was flying too low, I don't know," Irwin 
Gellman said. "She was a very careful pilot." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Gellman was traveling from John Wayne Airport to Oakland to meet a 
publicist to discuss details of a round-the-world trip she planned in her 
plane, which she hoped would set records. 
</P>
<P>
While flying was her hobby, Mrs. Gellman, 43, practiced law and was owner of 
VIP Properties Inc., a real estate firm. She lectured nationally on real estate 
law and syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Oct. 5, 1945, in Baltimore, she grew up in New Jersey, where she 
attended Dwight School for Girls. She graduated from Indiana University and 
attended Georgetown University Law School and George Washington University in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
She worked as an assistant attorney general with the state of Maryland before 
moving to Newport Beach with her family in 1977. She was active in the League 
of Women Voters and the Master Chorale of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A chapel service will be held today at Pacific View Memorial Park, 3500 Pacific 
View Drive, Newport Beach. The funeral will be at 2 p.m. Friday at the Harbor 
Christian Church of Newport Beach, 2401 Irvine Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Gellman is also survived by her children Susan, 16, Scott, 12, and 
Charles, 10; her father, Horace Schwerin, and brother, Bruce Schwerin, both of 
New Jersey.

DORNAN IN GROUP THAT SAW ARMENIAN EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE

<P>
As a Californian, Rep. Robert K. Dornan is used to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Wednesday that the impact of seeing firsthand the devastated 
Armenian town of Leninakan has left him with some chilling images. 
</P>
<P>
"The children who still had parents would usually smile," he said, " but the 
ones who had lost their parents usually wouldn't smile. I can remember one such 
girl, who had only one arm and one leg remaining, and she barely managed a 
smile when I squeezed her hand." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, a Garden Grove Republican, returned Wednesday from a two-day tour with 
Reps. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) and Robert G. 
Torricelli (D-N.J.) of the areas hardest hit by the quake last month in Soviet 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Coelho said Secretary of State George Shultz had proposed the trip as "a 
humanitarian gesture" by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take decades to rebuild to where it was," Dornan said, "but we have 
now learned how important it is to really study the California earthquake 
situation. There is something about all of that twisted rubble that is too 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Awesome Force' 
</P>
<P>
Both Dornan and Coelho said they found it difficult to imagine similar 
destruction occurring in earthquake-prone Southern California, where buildings 
are built with just such a catastrophe in mind. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dornan said he is now even more conscious of the dangers of a major 
earthquake and the need for adequate building codes and emergency preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of improper construction are shocking," he said. "We saw a stack 
of nine slabs of concrete that used to be a nine-story building. Our buildings 
are better, but (in a major quake) we would have a great deal of fires." 
</P>
<P>
Coelho echoed that concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we appreciate the awesome force of an earthquake," he said. "We 
tend to believe that we can handle anything. But the awesomeness of an 
earthquake is something even pictures can't show. When you see it, smell it, 
hear it, you realize how devastating it is. There are forces stronger than 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said the four congressmen on the tour would issue a recommendation to 
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) next week calling for a worldwide commission 
to provide immediate assistance in future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to have some coordinating commission for disasters like this," 
Dornan said. "Even hours are important when people are crushed under 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>

Red Tape Snarled Dogs

<P>
The congressmen will suggest that such a commission be set up through the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has a high commissioner for refugees," he said. "We now 
need a high commissioner for disaster relief." 
</P>
<P>
In one instance after the Armenian quake, Coelho said, search dogs remained on 
a U.S. plane for nearly 4 hours until papers required by the United States had 
been processed. 
</P>
<P>
"That is just absurd," he said. "Our government took the position during the 
Armenian quake that we were not going to do anything unless they asked. Every 
other country said they were going to help unless they object. We need to be 
able to respond faster." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan repeatedly talked about the children he saw on his trip -- on the 
streets and in the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost feel foolish passing out coloring books and candy among all that 
agony," he said, "but it's all we could think to do. We told them that the 
American people were praying for them." 
</P>
<P>
Both Dornan and Coelho said their visit seemed to have an impact on the 
survivors in Armenia as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in the eyes," Dornan said.

WORK HARDER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OUT OF COURT, JUDGE WARNS LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge, worried about a potential backlog of 
lawsuits, warned lawyers this week that they must work harder at settling 
disputes out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William F. McDonald, in a memo being circulated within the legal 
community, announced that he and other jurists who hear legal arguments in 
civil cases will soon demand "literal compliance" with a widely violated local 
rule of court. That rule requires lawyers to meet and try to iron out their 
differences before bringing legal motions to court. 
</P>
<P>
The action is aimed at unclogging of the courts at a time when record numbers 
of lawsuits are being filed. In 1985-87 alone, the number of new civil claims 
in the county climbed from just more than 33,000 annually to almost 38,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creative Arguments Expected 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers, however, doubt that the judge's warning will result in more 
productive out-of-court discussions but, instead, expect that it will spur more 
creative arguments by lawyers who want to convince the court that they are in 
compliance with the "meet and confer" rule, as it is known. 
</P>
<P>
"The court realizes that a lot of lawyers aren't meeting and conferring now, 
but this isn't going to change that much," said lawyer Robert John Rossi of 
Santa Ana. "The problem really has to be resolved between the attorneys 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court was one of the first courts in the state to 
require that lawyers make an effort to work out disputes before bringing judges 
into battles over legal motions. Several other judicial districts have followed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say the rule has been all but ignored by many lawyers in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, Judge McDonald said in an interview Wednesday, local lawyers get 
around the "meet and confer" requirement with nothing more than a quick and 
essentially useless telephone call. The lawyers then take up huge chunks of 
court time with legal squabbles that could have easily been resolved by the 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo dated Jan. 9 that will be published in local legal journals, McDonald 
declared that, beginning in March, judges will no longer tolerate a brief 
declaration from lawyers claiming that "we met and could not agree." 
</P>
<P>
And lawyers who do not demonstrate a "good-faith" attempt to resolve their 
disputes out of court will face sanctions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that this will result in a more substantial discussion between 
the attorneys and help the courts run more smoothly," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heading Off Problems 
</P>
<P>
McDonald maintained that the law-and-motion section of Superior Court, which he 
oversees, has overcome previous backlog problems and that his warning is only 
precautionary, aimed at heading off future problems. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, the daily workloads of the judges who handle 
law-and-motion matters have increased from about 15 hearings to 20 in just the 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
And several local lawyers, citing a backlog they consider to be a serious 
problem, said they often have to wait up to 2 months for a hearing, while the 
time lapse just a few years ago was several weeks.

EX-PARTNER REPORTEDLY THREATENED THOMPSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friends of millionaire Anaheim racing promoter Mickey Thompson and his wife 
have told homicide detectives that the couple complained of death threats from 
his former business partner before their gangland-style slayings 10 months ago, 
court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed with Los Angeles Municipal Court to support issuance of a 
search warrant last month, a sheriff's investigator said the couple's 
acquaintances claimed that the Thompsons said the threats came from Michael 
Goodwin, a Laguna Beach racing promoter. Goodwin had waged a fierce legal 
battle with Mickey and Trudy Thompson, who operated their lucrative promotions 
out of offices at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodwin's Santa Ana attorney, Alan Stokke, said Wednesday that his client 
would have no comment on the statements by Thompson's friends reported in the 
court document, "other than to say that he absolutely and completely denies 
that he had any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin, 43, and Thompson, 59, the first American to break the 400-m.p.h. land 
speed mark, had a falling-out in 1985 and filed several lawsuits against each 
other. Goodwin and his company declared bankruptcy after a court ordered him to 
pay Thompson $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompsons were gunned down as they were leaving their Bradbury estate in 
the San Gabriel Valley on March 16, 1988. Two men were seen leaving the scene 
on bicycles and a third man abandoned a bicycle in nearby Irwindale, hitching a 
motorcycle ride out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of Thompson's neighbors, according to the affidavit filed by Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department homicide investigator Cheryl Lyon on Dec. 9, 
recalled that Thompson told him Goodwin "was going to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
A woman reportedly remembered Trudy Thompson confiding that if anything 
happened to her or her husband, "Michael Goodwin would be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, a business associate said the famed racing figure 
once told him over the phone, "Can you believe this? The guy threatened to kill 
me if he lost the civil suit." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson reportedly went on to say -- in the witness's words -- that "the guy 
would not only kill him, but his whole family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempts 'Thwarted' 
</P>
<P>
In her affidavit, Lyon said Goodwin's attorney had "thwarted" attempts to ask 
Goodwin if he was the source of the death threats or a "link with the suspects 
who were hired to kill the Thompsons." 
</P>
<P>
The search warrant was for records at a Los Angeles cellular telephone billing 
office and was prompted by what Lyon said had been a call from Goodwin's 
57-foot boat, Believe. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide investigators would not say Wednesday 
whether they had found the person they were seeking.

WESTERN MISSES 12 OF 16 FREE THROWS IN LOSS TO SAVANNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If free throws really are free, then why couldn't Western High School buy one 
Wednesday night in its Orange League opener against Savanna? 
</P>
<P>
Western made only 4 of 16 free throws in a 54-50 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an explanation," Western Coach Greg Hoffman said. "We work on 
shooting free throws as hard as anybody. We're shooting 68% as a team, and we 
can't make a free throw in our own gym. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost every ballgame this year because we couldn't hit a free throw. We 
played well enough to beat them, and if we make the free throws, we win 
easily." 
</P>
<P>
Western (10-4, 0-1) took a 24-11 lead in the second quarter but went cold from 
the field and eventually trailed, 25-24, early in the third quarter when Jim 
Priest scored for Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
Priest continued to make the big plays for Savanna, hitting a 3-point shot that 
tied the score, 35-35, early in the fourth quarter and then padding Savanna's 
lead to 45-40 on a jump shot with 2:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Priest and teammate Tim Tillman each scored 17 points for Savanna (15-1, 1-0). 
Sam Sabbara led Western with 24 points but made only 3 of 9 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 10 games, Jim Priest has been our leader, and I thought he did a 
super job on (Joe) Romero," said Tom Gregory, Savanna coach. 
</P>
<P>
Romero, averaging 18.6 points per game, scored only 8. The 3-point specialist 
made 1 of 5 shots from 3-point range. No other Western player scored in double 
figures as the Pioneers were limited to their lowest scoring output of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly win, but then it's always an ugly game when you play Western, 
and that's a compliment to them," Gregory said. "Nobody plays harder than they 
do, and I knew we'd have problems handling their press." 
</P>
<P>
Savanna, which has routinely produced excellent point guards over the past 8 
years, is a team in need of a ballhandler. The Rebels committed 22 turnovers 
against Western's press. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 41, Valencia 33 -- Aaron Chamberlain scored 11 points and Matt 
Chamberlain 10 to lead Brea-Olinda (12-5, 1-0) at Valencia. The Wildcats 
trailed, 22-20, after three quarters but outscored the Tigers, 21-11, in the 
final quarter. Rudy Lopez scored 10 points for Valencia (3-7, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia 50, Anaheim 47 -- Jurry Jones scored 11 points to lead a balanced 
Magnolia attack at Anaheim. The Sentinels (7-6, 1-0) trailed, 37-20, at 
halftime. However, they outscored the Colonists, 30-10, in the second half. 
Danny Castro scored 17 points and Jude Barbito 14 for Anaheim (7-7, 0-1).

SADDLEBACK WINS DESPITE ESTANCIA RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a disappointing 58-55 Sea View League loss to Saddleback High School 
Wednesday night, members of Estancia's basketball team will no doubt be faced 
with the torturous what ifs? 
</P>
<P>
A select few: 
</P>
<P>
-What if Estancia had come out in the first quarter as it did in the third and 
fourth, with non-stop intensity? 
</P>
<P>
-What if Estancia played its game -- shooting from 3-point range -- instead of 
trying to drive around and through the tall Saddleback defenders? 
</P>
<P>
-And what if Estancia had shot better than 17% from the field in the first 
half? 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Estancia, which trailed, 29-17, at the half, staged a thrilling 
rally in the second half. After outscoring Saddleback, the county's top-ranked 
team, 14-7, in the third quarter, the Eagles closed the gap to 37-35 with just 
less than 6 minutes remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, it was a furious finish with Estancia finding its groove 
and Saddleback fighting to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
Malru Dottin, who finished with a game-high 26 points, proved the savior for 
Saddleback (15-1 overall and 1-0 in Sea View play). Dottin scored 11 of 
Saddleback's 22 fourth-quarter points, several of which came on follow shots 
and offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback extended its lead to 49-41 with 3:45 remaining, but Estancia, keyed 
by Andy Scholes' follow shot, came back to within 2 (55-53) with 27 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Agnew made both ends of a 1-and-1 situation to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody said it was going to be easy," Pat Quinn, Saddleback coach, said. "We 
fought and did what we had to do to win, and that's all I can ask of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were our own enemy, though. We made 21 turnovers, half of which were 
unforced. We have to get back down to business." 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was very effective at the start. Estancia missed its first 12 
shots before Augustin Heredia made a layup and drew a foul for a three-point 
play with just 43 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Those were Estancia's only points of that period though, as Saddleback led, 
7-3, after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Eagles -- who shot 69% in the second half -- a little tight in the 
early going against the county's No. 1-ranked team? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said. "We were. We had a nice comeback, 
we could have a nice pat on the back for that, but for a team that relies on 
shooting . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Estancia was especially ineffective from 3-point territory. The Eagles, who 
went into the game shooting 53% from beyond the 3-point line, did not make a 
3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia led Estancia (13-2, 0-1) with 22 points and Mike Curtis added 15. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Agnew, who was not expected to play because of an ankle sprain suffered in 
the Orange Holiday tournament, helped Saddleback with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sea View League action: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 46, University 31 -- Corona del Mar (11-4, 1-0) ran off the 
first 9 points and was never behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings hit 3 3-pointers in the first quarter, 2 by Matt Cwiertnia and 1 
from Warren Johnson. University fell to 0-1 and 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 70, Newport Harbor 61 -- Jason Moore scored 18 points to lead Tustin 
(11-5, 1-0) at Newport Harbor. Cheavly Ly scored 14 points and David Beilstein 
13 for the Tillers. Scott Gray scored 16 points for Newport Harbor (11-5, 0-1).

VAROS' BANK SHOT ALLOWS CYPRESS TO CASH IN, 61-60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mike Varos banked in a 5-foot shot with 3 seconds left as he fell to the ground 
to help Cypress College gain a 61-60 upset over Fullerton in an Orange Empire 
Conference men's basketball game Wednesday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a chance to tie the score but Geoff Adams made only 1 of 2 free 
throws with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Varos, who played the last 10 minutes of the game with 4 fouls, scored a 
game-high 21 points, including 5 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a feeling today that something like this was going to happen," 
Varos said. "I just said a little prayer before the game and hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Varos made a 3-pointer with 5:47 left to give Cypress a 59-50 lead. But Cypress 
didn't score again until Varos' final shot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fullerton came back and finally tied it, 59-59, on a layup by Jeff 
Stewart with 59 second left. 
</P>
<P>
In the final minute, each team had a turnover but Cypress had the ball with 26 
seconds left after a rebound by Vince Hizon and called timeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (9-10 overall and 2-1 in conference play) then worked the ball 
around until Varos had it with 5 seconds left, 15 feet from the basket. He then 
drove in for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (16-4, 1-1) got a final chance when Adams was fouled by Andre 
Lamoureux as he tried a 3-pointer as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams cleared to the side as Adams lined up. But his first shot rolled off 
the rim, and the game was lost. The second was good to set the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton came into the game shooting a conference-worst 61% from the 
free-throw line and shot 52% (12 of 23) in the game. Cypress was the best in 
the conference at 74% and shot 76% (16 of 21) in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great team win for us," Cypress Coach Don Johnson said. "Varos has 
got to be on the floor for us to win. He has shown he can play with fouls but 
we wish he wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had led, 43-35, at the half but the Hornets didn't score for almost 
the first 8 minutes of the second half as Cypress went on a 14-0 run and led, 
49-43. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 56, Saddleback 49 -- Dareck Crane scored 16 points and Chip Hanlon 
15 for host OCC (17-4, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 87, Rancho Santiago 71 -- Michael Stewart scored 25 points and Bobby 
Joyce 19 for visiting Riverside (18-7, 2-1). Tony Smalley scored 16 for Rancho 
Santiago (11-8, 1-2).

Connelly said.

PRIME COMPUTER MOTION ATTACKS MAI FINANCING PLAN FOR TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Computer, the target of a hostile takeover bid from MAI Basic Four of 
Tustin, has filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Boston claiming that MAI's 
proposed financing for its $970-million offer violates Federal Reserve Board 
margin requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer manufacturer, claimed that MAI's 
$20-a-share tender offer violates Federal Reserve margin requirements because 
it pledges more than 50% of Prime's stock as security for funding the takeover. 
MAI has proposed purchasing Prime's outstanding shares by using $20 million in 
cash, $875 million in high-yield "junk bonds" to be raised by the investment 
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert and $650 million in bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's motion, filed Tuesday, is an effort to bolster its suit aimed at 
blocking MAI's acquisition bid. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a computer manufacturing and service company, called the Prime motion "a 
meritless claim aimed at blocking Prime's owners from maximizing the value of 
their holdings." 
</P>
<P>
In an order issued Dec. 29, U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone in Boston said 
the highly leveraged MAI offer raised a "serious question" of whether it 
violated federal margin requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzone issued an injunction barring the MAI offer until the Tustin firm could 
provide additional details about its financing of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
MAI launched its takeover offer on Nov. 15. Prime has rejected the offer, which 
was scheduled to expire at midnight Wednesday, as inadequate. DAVID OLMOS

EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MICRO D DROPPED BY COMPETITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Micro D's largest competitor, Massachusetts-based Microamerica, said Wednesday 
that it is no longer pursuing a possible acquisition of the Santa Ana personal 
computer products distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no ongoing discussions," Microamerica spokeswoman Ann Mauriello 
said. "We kind of tested the waters, and there was not much interest." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Microamerica approached Micro D in late December about 
the possibility of acquiring all the Santa Ana firm's stock for $15 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D's controlling shareholder, Nashville-based Ingram Industries, has 
offered to acquire the 41% of the firm that it does not already own for $12.50 
per share, or about $37 million. A special committee of Micro D directors has 
rejected the Ingram offer as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Microamerica's overture to Micro D was disclosed last week in a Securities and 
Exchange Commission filing by Ingram. Microamerica, based in Marlborough, 
Mass., also had told Ingram that, alternatively, it might be interested in 
acquiring the Nashville firm, according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, a privately held company, said it wasn't interested in selling its 
interest in Micro D or being acquired by Microamerica. 
</P>
<P>
Microamerica and Micro D are the nation's two largest distributors of personal 
computers and related equipment. Ingram is a large conglomerate with interests 
in computer products distribution, marine transportation, oil and gas 
exploration, and insurance.

SCR DIRECTOR BENSON SAYS FUGARD'S 'ROAD TO MECCA' EVOKES ENORMOUS COST ARTISTS 
PAY FOR ROLE IN SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When "A Road to Mecca" opens Friday on the Mainstage at South Coast Repertory, 
it will be the third play by Athol Fugard that Martin Benson has directed at 
the Costa Mesa theater -- more than that of any other playwright. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the 51-year-old SCR co-founder is more readily associated with Shaw and 
Synge because of the accolades heaped upon his staging of their works. 
"Misalliance" in 1987 and "The Playboy of the Western World" in 1985 won 14 Los 
Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards between them. 
</P>
<P>
"The humanness of Fugard's plays is what lures me," Benson said. "The people 
are so utterly real. And they are all in a situation of extremis. Fugard is a 
great storyteller. I don't necessarily think he is a great poet, say, as 
Tennessee Williams is. But his stories are so trenchant, so piquant. They're 
always very vivid, very spare." 
</P>
<P>
The first play by the South African playwright to draw Benson's attention was 
"Blood Knot," a primal tale of love and hate between two black brothers -- one 
of whom can and does pass for white. Benson mounted the play, which can be seen 
as both a family drama and a metaphor for apartheid, on SCR's Second Stage in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The second was "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," a parable of shame taken 
from an incident in Fugard's life. The play unfolds one quiet, rainy afternoon 
in a small cafe and climaxes with a shattering insult when the proprietor's 
son, a white boy of 17, invokes racial privilege against the black waiter who 
has virtually raised him from childhood. Benson did "Master Harold" on the 
Mainstage in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Fugard often writes about his own experience," said the lanky, bearded 
director, who flies acrobatic planes as a hobby and sat picturesquely in his 
office wearing an old leather pilot's jacket with a sheepskin collar. "That is 
why he is such a great storyteller. He can take the simplest incident and 
construct around it, creating import and impact. But it starts with the 
simplest things." 
</P>
<P>
This time especially, because the central figure in "The Road to Mecca" seemed 
to Fugard glancingly remote at first, in real life a lonely curiosity shadowed 
by rumor. 
</P>
<P>
As he has written, the seed for "Mecca" was planted during a drive through the 
village of New Bethesda in the Karoo desert, 15 miles from where he was born in 
1932. On a return trip to buy one of the "dirt-cheap" houses for a hideaway 
from the city, the playwright heard of a reclusive widow in the village who was 
considered crazy by the locals. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that her craziness took the form of rather silly statues and 
sculpture that she made and had all around her house," Fugard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he used to stroll by her house to look at her garden of statues -- all 
facing in the direction of Mecca. But "apart from seeing her in the distance 
once or twice, and nodding at her," the playwright recalled, he "never got to 
know her personally." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard realized, of course, that the tensions between an eccentric widow and a 
town alienated by her deviation from the norm would make "a damn good story." 
Yet he was not hooked until years later, after she died, and an actress asked 
him why he "never had two women together" on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Fugard discovered that during the last years of her life, the 
woman, named Helen Martins, had developed a deep friendship with a young woman 
who taught in Cape Town and was rebelling against the mores of South African 
society at large. 
</P>
<P>
"The young woman gave me . . . a photograph of herself and Miss Helen," Fugard 
wrote. "I took one look . . . and there was my play." 
</P>
<P>
First staged in 1984 at Yale Repertory under Fugard's direction, "The Road to 
Mecca," is set in New Bethesda in Miss Helen's house. The time is 1974. There 
are three characters -- Miss Helen, the young teacher Elsa, who arrives one 
night on an urgent visit, and Marius Byleveld, the village pastor, who is 
concerned about Miss Helen's health. 
</P>
<P>
Fugard, who is also an actor, played Marius in a 1987 revival at the Spoletto 
Festival and again on Broadway in 1988. Given Fugard's frequently stated 
identification with Miss Helen, it was compelling casting, inasmuch as Marius 
personifies everything against which Miss Helen stands. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Mandel, the noted Beckett actor who directed Pinter's "The Caretaker" at 
the Los Angeles Theater Center last season, is making his SCR debut as Marius. 
Nan Martin, last seen at SCR in "Aunt Dan and Lemon" and more recently at LATC 
in "The Seagull," is Miss Helen. And Christine Healy, who was in "The Real 
Thing" two seasons ago at SCR, is Elsa. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most powerful messages in this play," SCR's Benson said, "is the 
artist's need to create. It doesn't necessarily have to do with a palpable 
appreciation for art, or whether the art is good even. It has to do with a 
particular urge -- genetic, psychological, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"One Sunday, when Miss Helen was all dressed up to go to church, which she had 
done every Sunday of her life. She took off her prim dress and white gloves, 
changed her clothes and mixed up some cement to create herself a mermaid. Why? 
Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"But there is an implicit lesson that says the artist is a unique individual in 
society, and that the artist pays an enormous price for that. There is a 
certain amount of isolation. There is an inevitable amount of rejection." 
</P>
<P>
More explicitly, Benson said, the drama derives its strength from the personal 
interplay between Miss Helen and Elsa, while tracing a thematic tangent about 
the moral and political climate of their country. "Mecca" focuses, for 
instance, on the difference between trust and love rather than exploiting 
"buzzwords that go off in our brain, like apartheid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for the first time in a major Fugard play, there are no black 
characters -- except in reports about their brutalized, poverty-stricken lives 
off stage. 
</P>
<P>
As to on-stage villains, Benson said the play has none -- not even Marius, 
whose Victorian values may approximate those of Pastor Manders in Ibsen's 
"Ghosts" but without his hypocritical motives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Marius truly means well," he said. "Like all of us, he does things out 
of love that are harmful. I think he truly loves Miss Helen. But he sees that 
her spirituality vastly exceeds his own, which makes him a desolate man." 
</P>
<P>
After his most recent Mainstage outings, the lack of villainy is something of a 
change of pace for Benson. Last season he directed Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan 
and Lemon," which is about the banality of evil. In September, as the SCR fall 
opener, he directed Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" about the Salem witch 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any dark moment in my soul," he said. "There was no 
tie-in in my mind. I didn't pick Miller or Fugard to satisfy some need of my 
psyche." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not. But "The Crucible," at least, must have satisfied some need in the 
public's psyche. It broke the SCR box-office record set last spring by Richard 
Sheridan's 18th-Century comedy, "The School for Scandal." 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed it would be our top-grossing show ever," said Benson, who has 
directed more than a third of the Tony-winning company's 230-plus productions 
in the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised, moreover, that "Misalliance" had also been a box-office smash 
-- although he likes to quip that Shaw is "one of the best young writers 
writing today." 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of circles," he said, "they think of him as 'dusty old Shaw,' and 
come to think of it, a lot like Miss Helen." 
</P>
<P>
Happy with the analogy, Benson paused. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said, "Shaw was reviled in his early days. He went though 
terrible depressions about his writing. His plays were crucified, just like 
Miss Helen's statues. But he kept working. So does Miss Helen. It's what 
'Mecca' is all about." 
</P>

SWING TUNES GREAT BUT NOT THE RENDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The most appropriate theme for the Big Band Classic concert at Ambassador 
Auditorium in Pasadena last week would have been "I've Heard That Song Before." 
</P>
<P>
While none of the 21 performers on the bill, which will be repeated Friday in 
Irvine, actually performed the tune, the audience that packed the theater no 
doubt could say those very words about every other tune offered during the 2 
1/2-hour tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The third in the Big Band Era series, this concert's purpose was to rehash the 
white swing music of the late '30s and early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Those applauding wildly the efforts of the Harry James Orchestra (a ghost band 
whose leader died in 1984) and singers Connie Haines, Art Lund and the Lancers, 
were, for the most part, cheering nostalgia. While the concert promised the 
best of James, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, the Pied Pipers, et al, what was 
forgotten was the quality that made those names musical institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pied Pipers, for instance, wouldn't have survived a single night had their 
singing been as out of tune as the Lancers' was. 
</P>
<P>
While the James aggregate -- populated, oddly, with youngsters whose parents 
were probably too young to remember much about the Big Band Era -- performed 
capably, albeit with not much spirit, Haines and Lund seemed oddly out of 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Lund, whose seven-tune set included a few megahits ("My Blue Heaven," 
"Mam'selle"), has lost most of his once-rich baritone voice. But his segment 
was unpretentious and pleasant enough. 
</P>
<P>
Haines, on the other hand, wallowed in embarrassing self-aggrandizement as she 
flitted about the stage coarsely whispering some of her hits ("You Made Me Love 
You," "Swing Time Up in Harlem"). Her voice, too, has suffered the ravages of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that these shows tend to take on a sideshow appearance, the 
saddest thing is that the life left in the era's repertoire is not explored. 
The songs deserve playing, not a mere rehashing that will turn them into museum 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Haines, Art Lund &amp; the Lancers join the Harry James Orchestra in 
songs by Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Harry James on Friday at 8 p.m. at the 
South Coast Community Church, 5120 Bonita Canyon Road, Irvine. Tickets: $10 to 
$12; information: (714) 856-5000.

USED-CAR MARKET 
</P>
<P>
Who buys used cars in Orange County? Lots of people, evidently. Men are more 
likely than women to have done so, as are young people and those whose formal 
education stopped at high school. Household income, however, provides no 
differential.

JOSEPH N. BELL: COUNTY'S HOMELESS GET COLD SHOULDER FROM BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing is simple. 
</P>
<P>
I got to wondering after our coldest weekend of the year why the Santa Ana and 
Fullerton armories had to be closed down to the homeless people who had found 
haven there on previous frigid nights. I knew the party line. National Guard 
exercises were scheduled last weekend, and under the governor's order that 
opened the armories to the homeless (on request of the appropriate county), 
Guard activities were to take precedence. 
</P>
<P>
OK, but what if people were freezing to death? Couldn't the Guard activities be 
rescheduled or the program modified to make the armories available at night 
when the suffering is greatest? Or is this just a flabby, soft-headed liberal 
type of question? 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather didn't think so. He's the insurance agent who devotes 20 hours a 
week of volunteer time to head the Orange County Homeless Task Force. He said 
displacing the homeless on the coldest night of the year was a tough set of 
priorities for him to understand, "but the reality is that the way the mandate 
came from the governor, our use of the armories is dependent strictly on their 
availability. It was especially tough because we didn't know in advance the 
Guard was going to be using them." 
</P>
<P>
So where did the homeless who had previously been put up at Orange County 
armories go last weekend when the weather left a filament of frost all over the 
county? 
</P>
<P>
"About 10 churches called and offered emergency facilities," said Mather. "A 
lot of volunteers came together to help. We had buses to pick homeless people 
up at designated points -- about 110 people in Santa Ana, 80 in Fullerton and 
40 in Mission Viejo. We took in everybody who came to us." 
</P>
<P>
Another crisis survived, but still the basic question remained. So I asked Maj. 
Steve Mensik, a spokesman for the National Guard in Sacramento, if armories 
throughout the state had been similarly closed. He said that 14 California 
armories had housed homeless people during the weekend and that three others 
had confined their drills to the daytime and were available to the homeless at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked why this hadn't been possible in Santa Ana or Fullerton, he said 
that not all Guard units drilled on the first weekend of the month and that 
those that did had quite different programs, only a few of which would permit 
using them for shelters on drill weekends. He also said that the Guard schedule 
is set up a year in advance and the county had been provided a copy. 
</P>
<P>
As for making an exception under crisis conditions, Mensik said: "We haven't 
been faced with a problem like that, but someone up here would have to make 
such a decision. We take orders from civilians, and we won't substitute our 
judgment for the civilians who run us. Under the governor's order, National 
Guard training has priority, but I suppose adjustments could be made to deal 
with critical needs. The county would have to make such a request through the 
state Office of Emergency Services. And as far as I know, no such request was 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it wasn't, says Margaret Beck, program manager of the Orange County 
Social Services Agency, who blames the lack of knowledge of a Guard drill in 
Santa Ana last weekend on "miscommunication between my office and the Guard. We 
know the schedule now, and it won't happen again. But we were still able to 
take care of everyone who wanted help." 
</P>
<P>
As for requesting an exception from the National Guard, "we communicated our 
problem to the Office of Emergency Services, and that option wasn't offered to 
me," she said, adding: "The Guard has been nothing but cooperative, and I don't 
think they deserve a bad press." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the firing line, Scott Mather listens to all of this and sighs and does 
what he has to do -- which is to get homeless people into warm shelters on cold 
nights. He would rather talk about permanent solutions anyway. "Homelessness," 
he says, "is a symptom of the housing crisis. As HUD funds continue to be cut 
in Washington, homelessness rises in almost direct proportion. It's going to 
take a national will to solve it, and the private sector can't do it all." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Mather sees a growing willingness on the part of Orange 
County's public agencies and private corporations to address the problem. His 
organization has developed a 5-year plan to provide permanent facilities 
throughout the county to deal with the homeless, "and we're finding increased 
sympathy in Orange County to this point of view. We're getting real help from 
areas of the private sector that simply wouldn't have been interested 5 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
He is also expecting funds generated by the passage in November of Proposition 
84, the Housing and Homeless Bond Act, to start coming down from Sacramento in 
a few months to provide seed money for this effort. "We've developed a model in 
Costa Mesa," he says, "that other Orange County communities can look to. 
Already Garden Grove is considering opening a facility, and we're looking for 
sites where zoning is in place for such facilities in other parts of the 
county. We're also trying to show residents that these facilities don't cause 
any increase in crime or a decrease in property values." 
</P>
<P>
Mather offers a kind of model himself. He understands that confrontation gets 
attention but not results -- a lesson a lot of elected public officials haven't 
yet figured out. We all owe a considerable debt of gratitude to such people as 
Scott Mather, who work quietly and effectively -- at a considerable sacrifice 
to their personal lives -- to deal with immediate social crises while they 
search for long-range solutions.

GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: WITH GRILL AND A GLAZE, HIS DINNER'S A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob McCray spent most of his life having his dietary needs determined by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
First there was his mother, then the Army and then a wife. 
</P>
<P>
He barbecued -- "burned" is a better word, he says -- occasionally, as befits 
any dutiful suburban husband and father. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the divorce and the jolting realization that (1) there's only so much 
cornflakes a family of three can consume in a day and, (2) the quickest way to 
go broke is feed yourself and two teen-agers three times a day in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I was forced to take a self-taught crash course in cooking," says McCray, 46, 
of Newport Beach. "That was 8 years ago, and I like to think I've done pretty 
well. At least, no one has died from my cooking -- that I know of, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the self-effacing McCray has done quite well, judging from comments 
by those who have enjoyed his culinary efforts. 
</P>
<P>
What he has actually done, he says, is simply master the barbecue process, both 
outside with charcoal and inside with an electric grill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things just taste better, whether it's fish or venison," the avid 
hunter and fisherman says. 
</P>
<P>
"A little glaze can do wonders." 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorites is the glaze he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys, which he 
uses on many dishes but particularly pork chops. It's basically a mixture of 
teriyaki and red-wine vinegar, with a little sugar and ginger thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a marinade, although I do marinate the meat a little in it," he says. 
"The real flavor comes during the grilling process, and I baste the meat often 
while it's cooking." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOB McCRAY'S GLAZED PORK CHOPS 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
6 medium pork chops 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
Pinch of ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
8 to 10 drops Maggi sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Mix all sauce ingredients and set aside. Soak each chop in sauce for a few 
minutes. When barbecue is at medium, place chops on grill and brush with sauce. 
Barbecue 5 to 6 minutes a side, basting with sauce every few minutes. Serve 
with rice and tomato wedges. (Serves 6.)

'TO GOOD GENES,' INDEED ;

<P>
SURPRISE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD, $5,500 GRANT CAP EVENING FOR TOP UCI RESEARCHER 
</P>

"To good genes," toasted John Wasmuth, Ph.D., as he lifted a glass of wine at 
dinner Tuesday in UC Irvine's University Club. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeknown to Wasmuth, a genetic researcher and professor of biochemistry, the 
highlight of the evening would be when he stepped up to the podium to accept 
the Research Associates' annual achievement award -- a Baccarat vase and $5,500 
grant to further his work in molecular genetics. At the time of his toast, the 
good doctor was still in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was attended by about 70 of the county's high profile set and marked 
the sixth year the Research Associates -- a support group for the university's 
College of Medicine -- have honored a faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
Among other accomplishments, this year's honoree was part of an international 
research team that linked schizophrenia to a genetic aberration, and he also 
helped identify a genetic marker for Huntington's chorea. 
</P>
<P>
After an abbreviated cocktail hour (it was a school night, after all), guests 
took their seats in a book-lined study for dinner of spinach salad and filet 
mignon, followed by fruit cocktail served with a slide-show presentation of the 
rudiments of immunology. 
</P>
<P>
The program was conducted by biochemist Gale Granger, whose infectious 
enthusiasm kept his audience as quiet as earnest undergrads. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting his award from Mary Roosevelt, Wasmuth riffed with a few prominent 
guests -- turning to Supervisor Tom Riley to ask about "this slope behind my 
house," and to Henry Segerstrom for help with "my wife's charge card at 
Nordstrom." 
</P>
<P>
A few laughs and a humble thank-you later, Wasmuth was back at his table, where 
staff member Signe Radovich whispered in his ear that $5,500 in unrestricted 
grant money would be deposited in his account. Beaming at the second surprise 
of the night, Wasmuth shook his head and said, "That's the best thing I've 
heard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In attendance were Research Associates directors Roosevelt, Renee Segerstrom, 
Floss Schumacher, Constance Morthland, Marilyn Nielsen, Jean Liechty, Ginny 
Frova and Michelle Rohe. Founder Athalie Clarke was unable to attend.

A divided state Supreme Court today reversed the death sentence of a Riverside 
man for a 1981 murder, saying the prosecutor improperly told jurors that the 
life-or-death decision was made by the law and the voters, not their own 
consciences. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-3 ruling allows a new penalty trial for Lee Farmer Jr. to decide whether 
he should be sentenced to death or life without parole. It is the 18th reversal 
of a death sentence, and only the second non-unanimous reversal, out of 65 
capital cases the court has considered since conservative justices gained a 
majority in 1987.

An armored car guard was held up shortly before 11 this morning outside a Bank 
of America near the Santa Monica Place Mall, Santa Monica police said. The 
robbers were believed to have fled, with an unknown amount of money, in a 1984 
Chevrolet, possibly a white Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance was summoned because someone was reportedly Maced during the 
robbery at 1301 Fourth St., police said. It was not known if the incident was 
connected with a series of more than a dozen armored car guard holdups during 
the last year.

WINDS RIP THE SOUTHLAND, BLOW PEPSI'S BLIMP TO BITS; 
</P>
<P>
GUSTS HIT 100 M.P.H. IN ONTARIO

Hurricane-force winds battered Southern California this morning, shredding a 
blimp, ripping part of the roof from a building and closing the runways at 
Ontario Airport, knocking over trucks, toppling trees and fanning a brush fire 
started by arcing power lines. 
</P>
<P>
At least 29,000 customers lost power before dawn as the cool, dry, winds 
blasted through areas below mountain canyons and passes at speeds as high as 
100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Police donned goggles to direct traffic as the winds whipped sand and dust into 
an opaque, tornado-like cloud between Ontario and San Bernardino, prompting a 
series of SigAlerts on Interstates 10 and 15 to warn of hazardous driving 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blimp Deflated 
</P>
<P>
The Airships Inc. blimp, used by Pepsi Cola Co. to advertise its Pepsi and 
Slice soft drinks, was "literally blown to bits" at its moorings at the airport 
in Ontario, according to airport spokeswoman Angie Summers. 
</P>
<P>
"Large pieces of it took off in the wind and proceeded to head toward Chino," 
said airport Manager Michael DiGirolamo. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than the nose cone of the airship remained attached to the mooring 
pole. The fabric of the blimp was reduced to ribbons and the gondola was dumped 
about 30 yards from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said winds up to 100 m.p.h., blowing dust, sand and debris from the 
shredded airship on the main runways combined to force closure of the airport 
from 9 p.m. Wednesday until about 7:45 this morning. 
</P>
<P>
She said at least 45 flights were delayed, canceled or diverted to other 
airports, such as Los Angeles International. 
</P>
<P>
A section of roof was torn from an Ontario Airport building that houses a 
kitchen providing food for up to 100 flights a day out of the airport. "That 
means there'll be no food on the flights going out this morning," DiGirolamo 
said. Officials said later, however, that airlines expected to fill food orders 
through other suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
David McMichael, shift manager at Marriott In-Flite Services plant, said a 
300-square-foot slab was torn from the building at about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It went 'BOOM,' flew south and snapped off a telephone pole, knocking out 
power for about two hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Jerry Hunter of the Orange County Fire Department said the 
100-acre blaze in Trabuco Canyon was started by two arcing electrical wires at 
about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said it took about 220 firefighters from throughout the county about three 
hours to control the blaze, which briefly threatened about 50 homes in the Rose 
Canyon area.

<P>
A group of prominent Americans filed a complaint today against 54 pro-Israel 
lobbying and political action committees, charging them with violating federal 
election laws. 
</P>
<P>
Among the complainants are James E. Akins, formerly ambassador to Saudi Arabia; 
George Ball, undersecretary of state in the Kennedy and Johnson 
administrations; Paul Findley, a former Illinois congressman who contends he 
was defeated in 1982 because of a campaign by the pro-Israeli lobby, and 
Retired Adm. Robert J. Hanks, who headed the Navy's Middle East Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The petition to the Federal Election Commission focuses primarily on the 
activities of an influential pro-Israel lobby called the American Israel Public 
Affairs Committee. It contends that the lobby violated the law by failing to 
register as a political action committee even though it allegedly targets 
political candidates for support and contributes to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint also charges that 53 pro-Israel political action committees made 
excessive contributions to candidates in the 1984, 1986 and 1988 election 
cycles.

The viewing audience was huge for the first live telecast from Moscow in which 
underdog Tel Aviv Maccabi beat the Red Army's CSKA team 97-92. In a nation of 
only 4.2 million, more than 2 million people were watching at the last basket, 
according to TV managing director Chaim Yavin. Even Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir, not a noted sports enthusiast, took time out to watch the game on a 
small portable set in his office.

President Reagan, flanked by new weapons of war, was honored today with a 
21-gun salute in an elaborate farewell ceremony by the military that benefited 
from his record $2.5-trillion defense buildup. 
</P>
<P>
A Marine band played martial music as Reagan, who will leave office Jan. 20, 
reviewed honor guards representing the Army, Air Force, Marines, Navy and Coast 
Guard in a huge hangar at Andrews Air Force Base on the outskirts of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who presided over the nation's biggest peacetime military buildup, told 
the assembled 1,400 military men and civilians that being armed forces 
commander in chief "is the most sacred, most important task of the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
He dedicated a moment of silence for the 595 servicemen who died on duty during 
his presidency. "They are not with us today because they are at the right hand 
of God. . . . They are our heroes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President, sent off to retirement by the marching tunes of each service, 
looked on the verge of tears when the band played strains of Auld Lang Syne. He 
blinked and swallowed hard as he stood at attention for the goodby. 
</P>
<P>
In the background were some of the weapons that joined the U.S. arsenal during 
his eight years as President -- an Army Apache attack helicopter, a Coast Guard 
search and rescue helicopter, a Navy F-18 fighter, a Marine Harrier jump-jet 
and a B-1B bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department declined to estimate the cost of the ceremony.

REAGAN ASKS $81 BILLION FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS FACILITIES

President Reagan today released a report calling for increased spending of $81 
billion to modernize the nuclear weapons complex over the next 20 years and the 
closing of four major facilities, including the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said the 31-page report "will enable the Administration and the Congress 
to adopt a long-term approach to modernization rather than a piecemeal response 
to the problems within the nuclear weapons complex." 
</P>
<P>
It recommended stopping nuclear fuels processing at Rocky Flats and three other 
sites where problems have been highly publicized: the Hanford Site near 
Richland, Wash., the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio, and the 
Mound Plant in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Waste management and environmental restoration at these sites will continue 
until completion," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether research activity would continue at Hanford, which 
produced the material for early atomic weapons during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the only three U.S. reactors capable of producing 
tritium, a critical element in modern thermonuclear weapons, could not be 
restarted until late 1989. The three reactors, all at the Savannah River Plant, 
in Aiken, S.C., have been shut down since last April undergoing changes to make 
them safer. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive maintenance, the 
reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable production efficiencies," said 
an unclassified version of the report, released at the White House.

EPA ALLOWS STOCKS OF BANNED PESTICIDE TO BE USED ON COTTON

The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it will permit cotton 
farmers to use remaining stocks of the pesticide chlordimeform this year but 
will not allow them to buy more after Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The agency last year announced its intention of canceling licenses to sell 
chlordimeform, which it said has been shown to cause tumors in laboratory 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, about 1 million pounds a year went to control the eggs and 
larvae of the cotton bollworm and tobacco budworm on about 12% of the nation's 
cotton crop. 
</P>
<P>
The two manufacturers, Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., and Nor-Am 
Chemical Co. of Wilmington, Del., had requested cancellation of the licenses 
and said they would recall inventories from sellers. Those requests were made 
after the EPA had announced that it intended to conduct a special study of 
chlordimeform. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it is requiring that those recalls be made, is canceling the 
licenses as of Feb. 19 and is not permitting any use by farmers after Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it had assumed that inventories would be used up during the 
1988 growing season but "drought and fewer pest problems" reduced use 
considerably and resulted in leftover stocks of 100,000 to 250,000 pounds on 
farms.

A robber called to say thanks after taking an undisclosed amount of money from 
a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, police in British Columbia said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten minutes after he had hit the bank, he called up and thanked them for their 
service and told them that the money will be well spent," detective Bjorn 
Bjornson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"At first he presented the teller with a withdrawal slip for $400, but it was 
illegible and he was asked to fill in the account number clearly. Then he 
produced an envelope bearing a badly written note. The teller got the message 
and filled it with money," Bjornson said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a weapon, but the officer quoted a teller as saying a gun 
might might have been mentioned in the note.

Stock prices pushed ahead today, extending the early-1989 rally that has 
carried the market to its highest level since the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.89 points to 2,222.32 -- 
less than 25 points shy of its close of 2,246.74 on Oct. 16 York Stock 
Exchange, with 899 up, 569 down and 509 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 183 million shares, up from 148.95 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.61 to 159.26. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's drive Wednesday past the 
2,200 level in the Dow Jones industrial average after a weeklong struggle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they cited a developing "bandwagon" effect as investors who had 
been bearish on the outlook for months felt increasing pressure to join in the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Bonds Hold Steady 
</P>
<P>
The market's steady advance since last fall has come without any support from 
interest rates, which have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has continued to tighten credit, and many Wall Streeters 
still believe the Fed might soon raise its discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, bond prices were mixed in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/32 point, or about 31 cents per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was unchanged 
at 9.04%. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lyski, a senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management, said the 
prices of Treasury, corporate and municipal bonds were virtually unchanged from 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the bond market was awaiting Friday's release of wholesale price and 
retail sales figures for December. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.125%, up from 9% late Wednesday.

WINDS RIP THE SOUTHLAND, FAN TRABUCO CANYON FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
FIERCE GUSTS RIP APART PEPSI BLIMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hurricane-force winds battered Southern California this morning, shredding a 
blimp, cutting electricity to thousands of homes and businesses in Orange 
County and keeping firefighters on the lookout for flare-ups in Trabuco Canyon 
hills, where a blaze destroyed 100 acres Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Residents returning to their homes in the charred hills surveyed the damage 
this morning from winds and fire and considered themselves lucky because recent 
rains and their own efforts saved their houses. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Battalion Chief Jerry Hunter said the blaze was started by two arcing 
wires at about 8:20 p.m. near Rose Canyon and Trabuco Canyon roads. After 
putting out the fire at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, firefighters stood by the 
charred area throughout the night as high gusts threatened to fan burning 
embers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the winds, they will go over the whole area piece by piece just to 
make sure there are no hot spots," Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze blackened about 10 acres atop a ridge before fierce 60-m.p.h. winds 
sent it across Rose Canyon Road and northeast toward the Joplin Youth Center. 
About 220 firefighters from throughout the county were brought to the rural 
canyon area north of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the winds died down just after 11, the fire lost its force," and 
firefighters were able to contain it, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Homes Threatened 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, although 50 homes in Rose Canyon were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said dampness from recent rains and the fact that residents had 
been conscientious about clearing brush around their homes, helped slow the 
fire. The Fire Department requires residents to clear the ground within 100 
feet of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you need a graphic example of why you should do it, this is it right here," 
Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas of Southern California, thousands of customers lost power before 
dawn as the cool, dry, down slope winds blasted through areas below mountain 
canyons and passes at speeds as high as 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. said power was restored to most of the 29,000 
customers blacked out in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties by 
late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police donned goggles to direct traffic as the winds whipped sand and dust into 
an opaque, tornado-like cloud between Ontario and San Bernardino, prompting a 
series of SigAlerts on Interstates 10 and 15 to warn of hazardous driving 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The Airships Inc. blimp, used by Pepsi Cola Co. to advertise its Pepsi and 
Slice soft drinks, was "literally blown to bits" at its moorings at the airport 
in Ontario, according to airport spokeswoman Angie Summers. 
</P>
<P>
"Large pieces of it took off in the wind and proceeded to head toward Chino," 
said Michael DiGirolamo, the airport's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than the nose cone of the airship remained attached to the mooring 
pole. The fabric of the blimp was reduced to ribbons and the gondola was dumped 
about 30 yards from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said winds up to 100 m.p.h., blowing dust, sand and debris from the 
shredded airship on the main runways combined to force closure of the airport 
from 9 p.m. Wednesday until about 7:45 this morning. 
</P>
<P>
She said at least 45 flights were delayed, canceled or diverted to other 
airports, such as Los Angeles International.

He said the bond market was awaiting Friday's release of wholesale price and

</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues rose 1/32 point, intermediate maturities rose 3/32 point and long-term 
issues ranged from up 1/32 point to up 3/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
rose 0.47 to 1,128.31. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials were down slightly. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.19 to 294.26. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.56% as the discount rose 4 basis 
points to 8.28%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.91% as the discount rose 2 
basis points to 8.42. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.12% as the 
discount remained at 8.46%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/8%, up from 9% late Wednesday.

BRAZIL PAYMENTS BOOST CHEMICAL BANK PROFITS

The first major U.S. bank reporting fourth-quarter results, Chemical Banking 
Corp., said today its 1988 net income was lifted by Brazil's payments on almost 
two years' of interest on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 4 U.S. banking company's fourth-quarter net profit rose to $288.5 
million, or $4.66 a share, from $229.6 million, or $3.83 a share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian payments are also likely to boost year-end results for other 
major New York banks, which last year suffered their worst year in history as 
Brazil halted its interest payments to commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's stepping up of repayments at the end of last year added $161 million, 
net of withholding taxes, to Chemical's fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
For the year as a whole, Chemical earned $753.6 million, or $12.02 a share. In 
1987, it lost $853.7 million, or $16.68 a share, due to adding $1.1 billion to 
its reserves for Third World loan losses that included Brazil and other 
nations.

Ford Motor Co., rich with cash from its record profits, today raised its

industry analysts. 
</P>

The increase from the previous level of 60 cents per share was Ford's first 
dividend increase since the second quarter of 1988, when the 60-cent level was 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's substantial dividend increase reflects Ford's commitment to maximizing 
the value of its shareholders' investment," Ford Chairman Donald Petersen and 
Vice Chairman Harold Poling said in a statement.

General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG for Plessey PLC to determine its 
possible impact on competition in Britain's electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
The decision temporarily blocks the bid from proceeding but allows the two 
bidders to hold under 15% of Plessey's stock. The bidders quickly increased 
their stake in Plessey to 14.9%, from about 3%, following the government's 
announcement.

Manitoba will become the first Canadian province to impose mandatory drug 
testing on amateur body builders, at the provincial championships in June, the 
president of the Manitoba Amateur Body Building Assn. said.

Randy Pearson said it's time to start weeding out steroid users. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking the place of people who don't use steroids by winning at a 
lower level and then not being able to compete after that, because there is 
testing on national and international levels," Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't expect the plan to meet much resistance.

The Cincinnati Reds said today they have acquired right-handed pitcher Luis 
Vasquez from the Boston Red Sox to complete a five-player trade made in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Vasquez, 21, from Boston's farm system completes the Dec. 13 
trade that sent first baseman-outfielder Todd Benzinger and right-handed 
pitcher Jeff Sellers to Cincinnati for first baseman Nick Esasky and 
left-handed relief pitcher Rob Murphy. The Reds also announced that veteran 
first baseman-outfielder Ken Griffey, 38, will report to Cincinnati's spring 
training camp in Plant City, Fla., as a non-roster player. Griffey, who played 
for Cincinnati in the mid-1970s, returned to the Reds by signing last Aug. 2 as 
a free agent after the Atlanta Braves released him July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez split the 1988 season between Boston's Class AA New Britain farm team 
and the Class AAA Pawtucket team.
