In office, he may have presided over 11-digit budget deficits, but Ronald 
Reagan, Private Citizen, is watching his pennies. 
</P>
<P>
A delivery truck pulled up Thursday to the Century City skyscraper that will 
soon house the Rectangular Office of the 40th president. 
</P>
<P>
Unloaded by workers who had passed Secret Service scrutiny were boxes 
containing all the office necessities a former President and actor could want. 
An observer counted three TVs (American-made) and three VCRs, one microwave, 
one coffee maker, one phone and one cassette recorder -- Japanese. And all of 
them were bought at Adray's, a chain discount store. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, this space introduced Photon, the happy zappy little 
"spokescharacter" for the L.A. Beautiful campaign to bring an end to potholes, 
litter, graffiti and other city detritus. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another Photon . . . a nationally franchised game of high-tech 
laser tag for adults -- controlled combat in a murky maze with dry-ice fog, 
bunkers and eerie music for a cathartic round of hunt-and-be-hunted. There is a 
Photon arena in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played the game," said a realtor who called to reveal the existence of 
Photon One. And "shocked at the crime rate and violence" here, the realtor 
"thought what a stupid symbol . . . for beautification." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that other Photon is really the evil twin Skippy, and L.A.'s Photon is 
going to create a kinder, gentler city. 
</P>
<P>
After 27 years, they have struck the colors on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The yellow-and-white-striped Giorgio Beverly Hills awnings that filled the 
tourists' home movies, even when they couldn't afford to fill their shopping 
bags, are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Avon bought the Giorgio fragrance and its appurtenances, so Fred Hayman furled 
the Giorgio stripes Thursday and hoisted gold-and-red awnings, his new colors, 
in their place. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the place 27 years ago from then-partner George Grant, who used the 
name Giorgio to sell Italian knit clothes. Grant could not have foreseen what 
he wrought. Wherever he is, said a store spokeswoman, he is "probably saying, 
'What did I sell?' " 
</P>
<P>
The good news: The city Bureau of Sanitation issued a press release, on 
recycled paper, announcing proudly that they had received about 3,000 old 
Christmas trees in its new recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news: The L.A. Times alone received seven copies of the release. 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't paid his rent, and thus he had been locked out of his Glendale 
apartment. That's the way it works. But he had to get back inside, the tenant 
insisted to the apartment manager. 
</P>
<P>
The fracas got so loud that someone called the cops, and inside the apartment 
in question, in two suitcases and a box, the cops found $521,248, neatly 
bundled. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Glendale there's something out of kilter about a guy with 
half-a-million dollars who doesn't pay his rent. To Glendale police, it looked 
like "major drug dealings." They took charge of the loot and arrested the 
ex-tenant, Benjamin Kardeni Bustillo, 38, a native of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Bustillo was booked for possession of a small amount of cocaine and marijuana 
-- as well as an unpaid traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The cash went into the "federal asset forfeiture system through U.S. Customs." 
</P>
<P>
The landlord is still apparently out his rent money.

HAPPILY EVER AFTER . . . THE SEQUEL 
</P>

Stephen Sondheim doesn't finish a show; he relinquishes it. As in San Diego, as 
on Broadway, "Into the Woods" (at the Ahmanson through March 5) plays like a 
brilliant notion still waiting to fall into place, a riddle unconsummated. 
</P>
<P>
But if ever a witch there was, it's Cleo Laine. 
</P>
<P>
"Brilliant" applies to the central notion here. Sondheim and librettist James 
Lapine have kidnaped some of the Grimm Brothers' favorite characters -- 
Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Jack and his cow, Rapunzel and her witch -- and 
put them into a kind of mega fairy tale, for interesting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The aim isn't to spoof them. Sondheim and Lapine do take a skeptical view of 
Prince Charming -- this show has duplicate Prince Charmings (Chuck Wagner, 
Douglas Sills), both womanizers -- and they are a little snide about Red Riding 
Hood (the wonderful Tracy Katz). Perhaps they are getting back at "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
But Cinderella (Kathleen Rowe McAllen) is seen as being just as sweet and 
blameless as in the original. All she wants to do is to go to the "festival." 
Sondheim and Lapine have no problem with that. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't Jack and his Mother (Robert Duncan McNeill and Charlotte Rae) 
get some nutrition out of that old cow of theirs? And why shouldn't the Baker 
and his Wife (characters you won't find in Grimm -- Ray Gill and Mary Gordon 
Murray) have a child? 
</P>
<P>
These are the "three wishes" that start out the story. Innocent as they are, 
they can't be achieved without a certain amount of deception, even on 
Cinderella's part. This leads to the show's central question: Does the end 
justify the beans? 
</P>
<P>
At intermission, it seems so. But when a Sondheim character sings the words 
"happily ever after," you know that something is afoot. Here, it's the Giant's 
wife, who takes very large steps. 
</P>
<P>
Laine's Witch is mixed up in this, too, both before and after her 
transformation. But enough of the plot. It is thicker than the thorns around 
Sleeping Beauty's castle, and this creates a problem. The comings and goings 
are ingeniously linked; no clue is planted that doesn't pay off later; but the 
show can't be watched with the mind-set that prevails at ordinary musicals. 
</P>
<P>
We have to keep constantly on our guard. Sondheim's jumpy, motivic score and 
intricate lyrics -- rendered with more clarity than either the San Diego or 
Broadway company commanded -- reinforce the mood. Without being breathless, the 
show rarely gets a chance to breathe, and the viewer rarely gets a chance to 
share something with a character, as opposed to learning something from her. 
</P>
<P>
This is part of the show's strategy. Act II is supposed to be the place where 
the conniving stops and our friends have to face the place that they have come 
to -- the end of the maze. This puts an enormous burden on the last half-hour 
of the show to come through emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
Sondheim's anthem "No One Is Alone" -- for Cinderella, Jack, the Baker and Red 
Riding Hood, all very much alone at that point -- will provide this 
breakthrough for some listeners, but it struck me as being an example of 
opportunistic inspiration, after an evening where almost every transaction has 
been seen as rooted in self-interest or stupidity. And what's this business 
about giants being human, too, at a moment when you're about to kill one? 
</P>
<P>
Laine's "Children Will Listen" seems less out of left field. This is rooted in 
something that the show has actually been considering, which is the 
relationship between parents and children, always either too close (Rapunzel 
and the Witch) or too distant (Cinderella and her Father). 
</P>
<P>
Forgive, forget and stop blaming: Life is everybody's fault. Those are 
wonderful things for a musical to say, and one wishes that "Into the Woods" 
were as wise and deep at its conclusion as it is amusing when it's skipping 
through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not scant the journey, though. There are lines in this show that make you 
whoop for joy -- and not just Sondheim's lines. The bad guys are always fun, 
particularly when they're congratulating themselves. Chuck Wagner's Wolf, for 
instance, a gourmet wolf who enjoys interviewing his meal first. 
</P>
<P>
The show is full of such witty and perverse conceits (no more perverse, by the 
way, than in the original). And Lapine's cast is wonderfully on the mark. One 
guesses that some of them -- Ray Gill's Baker, for instance -- were chosen for 
musical reasons first, but they're as nimble and likable as any company that 
has tripped through Sondheim's forest. 
</P>
<P>
And this touring version has Laine, whose witch is so smashing (in or out of 
uniform) that you're sorry to see her resign from the story in a snit, rather 
than resolve it. I wish, I wish . . . that "Into the Woods" were perfect. But 
there's much to admire, all the same. 
</P>

The sale of classical music station KFAC (1330) to a broadcast company that 
plans to switch to Asian-language programming looked like the end of Beethoven 
&amp; Co. on the AM dial. But now comes Saul Levine, owner of all-jazz KKGO-FM 
(105.1), to the rescue. Beginning in May, Levine's AM station, all-news KSHO 
(540), will switch its call letters to KKGO-AM at the same time that it goes to 
an all-classical format. That wouldn't have meant much to Los Angeles, given 
the station's relatively weak 1,000 watts of output. But the Federal 
Communications Commission has given Levine the go-ahead to boost power to 
25,000 watts. As a result, all-classical KKGO-AM should be capable of reaching 
as many as 10 million listeners in Orange and Los Angeles counties, living up 
to its new slogan: "Your concert hall on the air." ALEENE MacMINN

And actress Kathleen Noone, who picked up an Emmy during her 11-year run in the 
role of Ellen Dalton on "All My Children," is leaving that show the end of 
January to venture into prime-time roles. "They seem to have run the gamut for 
my character and it's time for a change," she told The Times Thursday. On her 
last show, taping Jan. 30 and airing Feb. 10, she'll go off on a business trip.

When ex-sportscaster Ronald (Dutch) Reagan heads home from Washington next 
week, he'll have a $100,000, one-year contract offer from KZLA-FM (93.9) and 
KLAC-AM (570) to consider. The stations made the offer to the President in a 
letter delivered to the White House on Thursday. "We got to talking about this 
guy who used to do sports years ago in Iowa before he got sidetracked doing 
movies and TV and politics for awhile," KLAC General Manager Norman Epstein 
said Thursday. "I brought up the fact that he'd be out of work soon." Half a 
century ago, Reagan launched his broadcast career as a play-by-play announcer 
and sportscaster for WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa. Epstein said that while the 
pay would be less than half Reagan's government salary, the hours would be 
easier, and the station is willing to install a studio in his home. "As 
President, he made $200,000, but this job isn't quite as important as that one, 
so I think the offer is a fair one," he said. The White House told Epstein that 
the President would make no decisions on his future employment until after 
Inauguration Day, but Epstein remains optimistic.

FARE FOR '50S REVIVALISTS AT THE PASADENA ELKS LODGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is this grand building? Why does it make me think of the Rose Bowl? And 
can I eat here? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is simple. It's the Pasadena Elks Lodge, and it was designed by 
Myron Hunt, the Rose Bowl's own architect. It has another New Year's Day 
connection, too, as a matter of fact. This corner of Colorado and Orange Grove 
is where the TV crews covering the Rose Parade set up. 
</P>
<P>
And sure, you can eat at the Elks Lodge -- most days, anyway, when the Elks 
aren't meeting. I wouldn't bring you all the way out here for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, a few steps down to your right after you enter from the parking 
lot, is a true time capsule that '50s revivalists might study in some detail. 
The elegant verticality motif, for instance: tall, skinny, unframed mirrors 
spotted at artfully varied heights, and wall lamps with narrow shades a couple 
of feet long, technically known as haloed downlights. Or the tamed Art Deco 
motif: On the wall behind the long bar are geometrical clusters of booze 
bottles with amber backlighting. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rather comfortable room too. There are hanging cork baffles over the bar 
so the noise level is low, and the whole place is warm and cozy. And 
reasonable. Bud on draft is 75 cents for a 12-ounce glass. One imagines Andy 
Rooney could be happy here. 
</P>
<P>
The food is time capsule stuff too. Breaded veal cutlet, for gosh sakes. And 
tomato imperial, a large tomato hollowed out and filled with tuna salad (not 
bad tuna salad, by the way) served on a vast quantity of iceberg lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
In short, plain Midwestern cooking with all its vices and virtues, the vices 
being mostly a matter of blandness and heaviness. The vegetables, moreover, are 
always cooked to death. These are the vegetables many of us were forbidden to 
leave the table until we'd eaten. As grown-ups we are entitled to leave them on 
our plates. 
</P>
<P>
What would I recommend? The sandwiches seem good. The steak sandwich comes with 
a pretty thick genuine steak, and you can't go wrong with the open-face turkey 
sandwich (a rather elegant touch: the cranberry jelly comes in a glass cup 
rather than paper). The burgers are not the thick, smoky, back-yard barbecue 
sort but more like Mom's thrifty Saturday lunch burgers, with thin patties and 
American cheese, perhaps of some nostalgia value. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, I'd always go for the specials of the day. While the regular 
menu choices at dinner include a mushy loin-cut Alaska halibut steak, the 
specials might be something rather nice, such as pork steak in very crisp 
breading (with a bland but oddly distracting milk sauce pooled on top), or very 
tender pot roast in plain beef gravy. 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays and Saturdays you can always get prime rib, regular or a huge 
bone-in cut of a size suitable for braining a dinosaur. Possibly the best thing 
I've had is the garlicky corned beef with cabbage, which is always available on 
Thursdays. Watch out for that horseradish sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The best dessert I've encountered was the coconut cream pie. Note: The "hot 
fudge" on the hot fudge sundae is actually the cold-spreadable sort. 
</P>
<P>
And if you run into Andy Rooney, say hello.

ISRAELI SETTLERS ANGRY, FEARFUL IN TENSE WEST BANK

ARIEL, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the grim willfulness that is their trademark, dozens of Israeli settlers 
tried Thursday to get to the place where the body of an Israeli taxi driver, 
slain by gunfire, was found a week ago. They were intent on building a monument 
to the victim, whom they see as a martyr and a symbol of their demands for 
greater security. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army, to avoid trouble, blocked their way with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
The insistent settlers left their cars and began to walk the 2 miles to the 
fork in the road where the body was found. But as they neared the place, 
soldiers arrived with a bus, herded them into it and took them back to their 
starting point. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous -- someone gets murdered, and they pick on us," said Ron 
Nachman, the mayor of Ariel, largest of the Jewish settlements on the West 
Bank. "But don't worry. We will return." 
</P>
<P>
The incident illustrated the increasingly uncertain condition of Israeli 
settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. After being encouraged by 
successive Israeli governments to settle on the disputed land, they find their 
future less and less certain amid increasing talk, in Israel and abroad, of 
trading the land for peace with Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they complain that the government and the army are failing to 
protect them from the hate and the stones of the Arabs, who regard them as 
aliens. Their clamor for protection is heard in Israeli enclaves from the 
hillside olive groves of the West Bank to the beaches of the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers want their status clarified, although they seem to feel that in 
the end they will be allowed to stay on land controlled by Israel, that the 
Arabs will accept it or leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We want some clear policy from the government," said Saralee Glasser, a 
resident of Elkana who immigrated to Israel 18 years ago and moved to the West 
Bank four years ago. "As far as we are concerned, we are living in Israel. We 
want the same protection as someone would get in any Israeli town. We want 
Israeli law applied here." 
</P>
<P>
The demands of the settlers -- about 70,000 of them in about 130 settlements -- 
have kept Israeli politicians busy responding with rhetoric, if not substance. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir traveled to the bleak mountaintop 
settlement of Brakh to speak at a memorial service for a security guard killed 
last month by an Arab intruder -- another example, the settlers say, of their 
vulnerable situation. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir spoke passionately of Israel's right to the land while a small group of 
enraged settlers, demanding a stronger hand applied to rebellious Arabs, tried 
to shout him down. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither murders nor stones nor Molotov cocktails will destroy the will of the 
nation of Israel to redeem the Land of Israel and settle it with many Jews," 
Shamir said. "Land of Israel" refers to the biblical Israel that Shamir wants 
to reclaim. 
</P>
<P>
"The nations of the world talk peace," he said. ". . . We tell them the danger 
to peace is not from Israel but from our enemies." 
</P>
<P>
This failed to satisfy the settlers huddled on the wind-swept crest. They 
screamed, "You're responsible!" and held up signs lettered, "The Blood of Our 
Brothers Cries Out for Revenge," referring to, among others, the taxi driver 
and the security guard. 
</P>
<P>
The body of taxi driver Shlomo Edri, of Petah Tikva, was found a week ago on 
the road near the settlement of Yakir with two bullet wounds in the chest. It 
was in his memory that the settlers wanted to build a roadside monument. 
</P>
<P>
The other victim, Yaacov Parag, was shot last month at Brakh, where Shamir 
spoke, by a Palestinian shepherd who was apparently angered over a pay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Both have become symbols of the settlers' goals and fears. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are angry," Mayor Nachman said. "They want action. Instead, the 
army stops us from building a monument." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the settlers have organized more and more protests designed to 
wrest greater protection from the government. In Jerusalem, a group of settlers 
is holding a hunger strike near the prime minister's office. In a tent, they 
display the crude weapons of the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising -- stones, 
nails, spikes, bits of scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, settlers blocked highways in the West Bank to protest the 
stone throwing that makes a nightmare of their daily passage to and from work. 
On Thursday, the settlers who were gathered at Brakh criticized comments 
attributed to Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, who suggested that the 
Arab uprising could not be crushed, only resolved politically. Some shouted, 
"Fire Shomron!" 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, the settlers defend themselves, even take the offensive against 
the Arabs. Many travel with pistols or submachine guns in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
The government and the army think some settlers are trigger-happy. This image 
was reinforced last fall when a settler shot and wounded two plainclothes 
Israeli agents trying to lay a trap for Arab stone throwers. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a frequent target of settler criticism, said 
that dissatisfaction among settlers in the occupied lands should not turn into 
a battle between Israelis -- that is, between the army and the civilian 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
At an army roadblock near Yakir on Thursday, settlers chased a group of Arab 
villagers who were taunting them. They fired two rounds from an Uzi submachine 
gun carried by one of the settlers. Soldiers looking on from nearby did 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen Israelis have been killed by Arabs since the start of the intifada, or 
uprising, including a woman and her three children who perished in a bus that 
was firebombed last fall near Jericho. Hundreds of buses have been damaged by 
rocks and at least 40 gutted by fire, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
About 13 Palestinians have been shot to death by settlers, and in all almost 
340 Arabs have been killed in the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
One settler, Israel Zeev, was found guilty in court recently of shooting to 
death a 28-year-old Arab shepherd last year near the West Bank settlement of 
Shiloh. Zeev said he fired in self-defense after the shepherd threw stones. 
Witnesses said Zeev fired without provocation. They said the victim recognized 
Zeev and shouted at him, "Israel, don't shoot!" 
</P>
<P>
Charges against two others accused in shooting cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
The settlers are a varied lot, perhaps as varied as the population of Israel. 
Some have come to the occupied territories in order to live cheaply, lured by 
concessions on costs and mortgage rates and knowing little of the area's 
biblical symbolism, which is so important to some Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the land is biblically ordained for Israelis. Under almost 
every stone they see the footprint of a prophet. Others see the land as 
territory won by Israel in what they consider a defensive war, the Arab-Israeli 
conflict of 1967, and they think it is necessary to retain this land for 
purposes of national defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as Israeli as anyone else," said Glasser, the resident of Elkana who is 
also a developmental psychologist. "We pay taxes and obey the law, and we 
demand to be treated like other Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
She has friends whose car windows have been smashed by rocks. One acquaintance 
suffered severe eye injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements are different from one another. Some look like American-style 
suburbs transplanted to the edge of the Arabian desert. Some are just a few 
inhabited boxes atop bare hills. Others consist of trailers jumbled on the 
sand. One, Ariel, has the flavor and boosterism of a small, growing, 
high-technology town. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to stay," Mayor Nachman said. "We are not like other settlements, 
a satellite of some town in Israel. We are the center of things here." 
</P>
<P>
Nachman has ambitious dreams for Ariel. He has laid out an industrial science 
park and hopes to attract new business. He would like to expand the boundaries 
but is hemmed in by Arab farms. 
</P>
<P>
"They planted these olive trees so we couldn't say the land was vacant," he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
While the settlers fret and protest, the government has undertaken a campaign 
to attract more Israelis to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Television 
commercials paint a rosy picture of life in the country. A recent campaign 
meant to attract settlers to the Gaza Strip, which like the West Bank is caught 
up in the intifada, urged listeners to "come enjoy the quality of life." Bumper 
stickers extol the sun and sand of Gaza Strip beaches. "Live in a young, 
effervescent community," a newspaper ad said. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was designed on behalf of Gush Qatif, a sandy beachside settlement 
with about 3,000 Israeli inhabitants. Gush Qatif is in the middle of the Gaza 
Strip, home to 700,000 Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have a lot to offer," said Datya Herskowitz, a spokesman for the 
settlement. "Children are safe in our community, it's quiet and there's lots of 
sun." 
</P>
<P>
However, residents of the area note that automobile trips from Gaza into Israel 
can be risky. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tense atmosphere outside," tomato farmer Ehud Neor said. Like others, 
he referred to surrounding Arab land as "outside." Neor said he once had to 
swerve his car sharply to avoid a gasoline bomb that had been hurled at him. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the settlers persevere. Developers of the newly built and bankrupt Qatif 
Beach Hotel hope for a return of visitors. The hotel was completed before the 
intifada began, then was closed when both government funds and business dried 
up. 
</P>
<P>
The government has plans for new settlements despite the problems of populating 
older ones. It is committed to starting as many as eight in the coming year, 
although it is not clear how much money is available for new settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Israel's principal ally and donor of aid, calls the 
settlements an obstacle to peace but has done nothing concrete to discourage 
them.

WINDS BLASTING TO 100 M.P.H. RIP SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hurricane-force winds battered Southern California on Thursday morning, 
shredding a blimp and closing the runways at Ontario International Airport, 
ripping parts of the roofs from two buildings, knocking over trucks, toppling 
trees and power poles and fanning two brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
At least 29,000 customers lost electrical power as the cool, dry, Santa Ana 
winds blasted through areas below mountain canyons and passes at speeds as high 
as 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Police donned goggles to direct traffic as the down-slope winds whipped sand 
and dust into an opaque, tornado-like cloud between Ontario and San Bernardino, 
prompting a series of Sigalerts on Interstates 10 and 15 to warn of hazardous 
driving conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The winds began to ease Thursday afternoon as a new weather system started 
pushing toward Southern California from the north. 
</P>
<P>
And forecasters said at nightfall that "the Santa Anas are essentially over." 
They said today should be mostly clear and rather on the cool side, with winds 
gusting to no more than 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. in the most exposed areas. 
</P>
<P>
The gusts peaked shortly before dawn Thursday, hammering hardest at the 
foothill communities in western San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 million Airships Inc. craft, used by the Pepsi Cola Co. to advertise its 
Pepsi and Slice soft drinks, was "literally blown to bits" at its moorings at 
the Ontario airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Large pieces of it took off in the wind and proceeded to head toward Chino," 
airport manager Michael DiGirolamo said. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than the nose cone of the airship remained attached to the mooring 
pole. The fabric of the craft was reduced to ribbons and the gondola was dumped 
about 30 yards from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Airships Inc. said the gondola and engines were saved. But the 
polyester fabric skin, designed to hold 233,100 cubic feet of helium, was a 
total loss. The spokesman said the skin could be rebuilt within six weeks, but 
too late for the craft's next scheduled duty -- the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario Airport spokeswoman Angie Summers said winds gusting between 80 m.p.h. 
and 100 m.p.h., blowing dust and debris from the shredded airship onto the main 
runways combined to close the airport from 9 p.m. Wednesday until about 7:45 
a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
She said that at least 45 flights were delayed, canceled, or diverted to other 
airfields, including Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
An air cargo container pushed by the winds slammed into the side of a Southwest 
Airlines jetliner parked at Ontario. Southwest spokesman Ron Todd said the 
impact dented the Boeing 737 and punched a small hole in the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
A section of roof was torn from an Ontario Airport building that houses a 
kitchen providing food for up to 100 flights a day. David McMichael, shift 
manager at the Marriott In-Flite Services plant, said a 300-square-foot slab 
was torn from the building's roof at about 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Rancho Cucamonga, the winds tore away a patch of roof at a San 
Bernardino County sheriff's substation, scattering paper work and personal 
effects around a briefing room and locker area. Several deputies said their 
personal cars in the parking lot were damaged by airborne debris. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Jerry Hunter of the Orange County Fire Department said a 
100-acre blaze in Trabuco Canyon was started by two arcing electrical wires at 
about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said it took about 220 firefighters from throughout the county more than 
three hours to control the blaze, which briefly threatened about 50 homes in 
the Rose Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
"It burned up quite a few back yards, but the houses were saved," said fire 
spokeswoman Kathleen Cha. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, a brush fire fanned by gusts of up to 60 m.p.h. spread rapidly 
in the Ramona area of San Diego County, blackening about 160 acres. 
</P>
<P>
No homes were threatened and California Department of Forestry officials 
expected full control by this morning. Officials said a downed power line 
ignited the thick grass and brush in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. said power was restored by late Thursday morning 
to most of the 29,000 customers blacked out in Los Angeles, Orange and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said only about 100 of its 
customers, in the Canoga Park and Sun Valley areas, lost electricity and in 
most cases, power was restored promptly. 
</P>
<P>
Interstates 10 and 15 remained open Thursday, but California Highway Patrol 
Officer James O'Brien said there were overturned trucks "everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"The most spectacular blow-over was where Interstates 10 and 15 meet in 
Ontario," said CHP Officer Vivian Firlien. "It left part of a truck hanging 
over the edge of one of those high transition roads, dangling over the 
motorists below." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Davis, general manager of a large truck stop in Ontario, said at least 
700 big rigs were parked there at one point early Thursday, waiting for the 
winds to ease. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the blowing dust and sand, traffic in some areas of western San 
Bernardino County was still moving at less than 5 m.p.h. at midday. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility was down to 10 feet in some places," Firlien said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times, said the high winds were generated by a large area of 
high pressure stationed over the Great Basin late Wednesday and early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the high pressure began to weaken late Thursday as a moderate, 
low-pressure storm system started to move south along the coast toward Southern 
California. The storm system will bring increasing clouds, and a "slight 
chance" of showers, to Southern California early Saturday, Beusterien said. 
</P>
<P>
It should be mostly sunny and clear on Sunday, he said, with increasing clouds 
on Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Thursday was 61 
degrees. Relative humidity ranged from 41% to 14%. 
</P>

area. Times Staff Writer Jean Davidson contributed to this article.

RACES SPLIT BY 'CULTURAL DIVIDE' 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clay Normand is a "huggy-kissy" person, a characteristic he proudly ascribes to 
his black cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the black style," says Normand, 43, a private youth services consultant 
who specializes in programs for black inner-city youngsters. "When we greet one 
another, for example, we're usually very affectionate on a 'brotherly-sisterly' 
level, no matter where we meet. You put your arm around your 'brother,' you hug 
and kiss your 'sister.' " 
</P>
<P>
But it is a style that -- along with many other black cultural styles he values 
and freely employs in his relations among fellow blacks -- Normand has learned 
to use cautiously with whites. Whites too often are offended by it, he says. 
And the consequences can be serious, particularly if the whites are ones upon 
whom your livelihood depends. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had white men let me know, in so many ways, that they were very 
uncomfortable with such expressions of friendship by me to their ladies," he 
said. "And although many white women can relate to this style with no problem, 
there are still those who find it insulting or sexist -- even though there's 
nothing sexual or demeaning to women about it." 
</P>
<P>
Even some black women have complained: "I've had them say to me privately: 'Cut 
that out in the workplace, Clay, because white folks will think we're sleeping 
together.' " 
</P>
<P>
Normand's experiences are not an isolated case. They reflect a side of daily 
life that is commonplace for black Americans and is becoming a matter of 
increasing concern and controversy between blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
Race relations have made dramatic strides in recent decades. Traditional 
barriers of color and class have fallen, old racial prejudices and stereotypes 
have waned, and blacks and whites are sharing their lives as never before -- in 
the workplace, in the classroom, at public assemblies and private gatherings, 
in restaurants and bars, and on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formidable Barrier 
</P>
<P>
But for all this progress, many social scientists and race relations experts 
say, the "cultural divide" between black and white Americans still forms a 
barrier to greater racial harmony and togetherness, a barrier that is sometimes 
even more formidable and intractable than color or class. 
</P>
<P>
These cultural differences go well beyond such issues as styles of greeting. 
They include patterns and preferences in dress, idiom, communications, 
interpersonal relationships and social behavior, and they reach even to many 
basic values and attitudes that blacks and whites hold toward life, work and 
spiritual well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks generally shy away from discussing such differences out of well-grounded 
fears that distinctive cultural traits will be mislabeled as inherent racial 
"deficiencies." Whites, on the other hand, tend to pass over the issue lightly, 
presuming that blacks operate largely -- though imperfectly -- according to the 
same cultural conventions and assumptions they use. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, divergent cultural assumptions challenge efforts to improve racial 
tolerance and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the cultural problem is the key problem right now in race relations," 
said Thomas Kochman, author of the 1981 book, "Black and White Styles in 
Conflict" and a communications professor at the University of Illinois' Circle 
Campus in Chicago. "After you deal with the problem of inclusion -- that is, 
increasing the number of blacks in the workplace and so forth and working on 
the racism, sexism and other things destructive of human potential -- you've 
got the cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
The workplace is one of the major focuses of the cultural clash, and one of the 
most troublesome spots in the work world involves the off-hours socializing 
that often is considered an unwritten job requirement in many professions and 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Status Conscious' 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and whites have often widely differing styles of socializing, not only 
with regard to preferences in food, music, dance and entertainment but in 
patterns of social behavior, male-female relationships and "small talk" as 
well. Blacks, for instance, generally are not as "status conscious" as whites, 
and thus tend to be much more intimate and "person oriented" in their approach, 
Kochman said. 
</P>
<P>
But another difficulty is that blacks also tend to consider their off-hours 
private time when they can be "black" without worrying about how whites will 
judge their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep my car radio programmed to a 'soul' station so that when I get off work 
and get into my car, I can get an instant blast of black culture -- whether 
it's rap, Motown or Whitney Houston," said a black communications specialist in 
Los Angeles who works in a predominantly white office. "If I'm angry, it calms 
me down. It makes me realize there's another world out there." 
</P>
<P>
But, particularly in careers where socializing in private life is sometimes 
deemed vital to professional advancement and success, blacks violate this 
convention at their own peril. 
</P>
<P>
At the New England university where he once taught, for example, playwright and 
black culture specialist Paul Carter Harrison declined to attend faculty 
socials because they had a style that he says was particularly at odds with his 
sensibilities as a black. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it very provincial and 'Joe Collegiate,' " said Carter, a native New 
Yorker whose books include "The Drama of Nommo" and his latest, "Totem Masks." 
"I preferred to do my socializing with black people." 
</P>
<P>
But Harrison was shocked when he received his first-year evaluation and 
discovered that he had been downgraded for what was regarded as antisocial 
behavior. "It said that I was a wonderful teacher, the students loved me, my 
work was terrific, my lectures were great, I was very well informed. There was 
only one problem: I failed to attend faculty socials." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison stormed into his department chairman's office and demanded an 
explanation. "I said: 'What's this about attending socials?' He said simply: 
'You don't.' I said: 'I'm quite sociable but I pick and choose the people with 
whom I prefer to socialize -- and I'm not interested in being with these people 
on my own time.' " 
</P>
<P>
The upshot, says Harrison, who is now playwright-in-residence at Columbia 
College in Chicago, is one that is familiar to many other blacks after such 
confrontations: "They're still there and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Kochman comments: "It's a problem blacks have all the time -- how to give white 
people what they want, and yet to stay black at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
On the job, blacks find they are often severely penalized for failing to 
conform to the usually dominant white cultural standards and practices. 
</P>
<P>
In a case last year that drew widespread attention and sparked a national black 
protest because of its symbolic value, one black employee of the Hyatt hotel 
chain lost her job and another was forced to wear a wig at work in a clash with 
company policy over their African-inspired "cornrows" -- tightly woven braids, 
sometimes beaded, that many black women wear as an affirmation of ethnic pride. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyatt worker who lost her job, a coffee shop cashier, was told that her 
braids violated hotel policy against "extreme and unusual hair styles." 
</P>
<P>
"These anti-cornrow braids policies exist in corporations throughout the 
country," said Eric Steele, a labor relations lawyer in Washington, D.C. 
"Hundreds of black women have been directly affected by them, either through 
disciplinary action or dismissal, and thousands more have been indirectly 
affected because they fear what might happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Asenath Moody, a professional wardrobe consultant in Washington who is 
black and has an exclusive clientele that is largely white, says her black 
clients are almost invariably plagued by fear that they will break some 
unwritten norm of dress and fashion in the white-dominated "power elite" 
circles in which they move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Concept of Fashion 
</P>
<P>
"I have very little trouble selling the black concept of fashion to my white 
clientele," Moody said. "In fact, they seem to enjoy being seduced from the 
solid-color canvas of their own cultural style and getting into the black 
style, which mixes feeling, comfort, color and joy. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the black woman who can afford me wants to look just like that 
solid-color canvas. She can't take the risk to her professional career or 
social status. She starts fighting me the moment she sees me coming. I've even 
had some of them try on an outfit and say: 'Don't you think that looks a little 
too 'colored?' " 
</P>
<P>
Such fears have solid grounds. Kochman, who also serves as a consultant on 
black-white relations to many private corporations, says blacks are penalized 
far more often and severely than whites for failing to conform to prevailing 
white business mores and manners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just violations of dress codes, it's across the board," he said. 
"Blacks have said all along that they perceive they cannot get away with the 
things whites can. This especially applies to black males, more so than black 
females. A constant complaint I hear from them is: 'If I did that, 'the man' 
would be all over my back.' " 
</P>
<P>
A constant source of friction between blacks and whites in the workplace is 
what Kochman calls the black "improvisational" style. 
</P>
<P>
"The Anglo work concept," he explained, "believes the shortest distance between 
two points is a straight line, and it values economy and efficiency. Only those 
moves considered essential to the job should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, in the black work ethic, there is an emphasis on spontaneity and 
individual style, on changing routine tasks to make them more interesting -- 
things that whites don't see as work-connected but as play." 
</P>
<P>
Kochman said that conflict in styles is evident on the professional football 
field, where black players try to go beyond the technical aspects of the game 
to perform not simply with proficiency but with flair. White coaches and 
officials, on the other hand, tend to view this as "showboating" or 
"hotdogging" and constantly impose rules and sanctions in efforts to deter such 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"For whites, the play is over when it's over," he said. "For blacks, there must 
always be time for the 'signature' move." He cites as an example the famous 
"end-zone shuffle" that Cincinnati Bengals' rookie running back Ickey Woods 
uses to celebrate his touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Even when blacks do conform to white cultural norms, they still run the risk of 
being perceived through racial or cultural stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seen as 'Temperamental' 
</P>
<P>
"At the newspaper in Washington where I used to work," said Sandra Gregg, 
Atlanta bureau chief for U.S. News &amp; World Report, "two reporters -- both 
women, one white and one black -- got into similar disagreements with their 
respective editors. The white reporter screamed and carried on, but she was 
seen as just being 'temperamental.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Gregg said: "The black reporter was very stern in her 
approach but became terser and quieter during the argument, in the white style. 
However, she was seen as having an 'attitude problem' -- and that reputation 
hung around her neck for years after that whenever she came up for evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
Although many blacks can adopt a "white style" in an effort to get ahead, that 
approach has a price. Kochman believes that blacks have a two-part identity -- 
one part based on race and the other on culture. He thinks that, emotionally, 
the cultural component is much more central to their personal identity than the 
somewhat artificial categorization of race. 
</P>
<P>
"To give up that cultural identity means giving up being for real," Kochman 
said. "Most other ethnic groups assimilate to the Anglo standard without any 
great sense of being false to themselves. But for blacks, that is a 
disintegration of self." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of dishonesty is reflected in such expressions as "playing the game" 
and "fronting," which blacks often use colloquially to describe getting over in 
the larger society, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debates on School Tests 
</P>
<P>
Schoolrooms and college campuses are another major focus of the cultural clash, 
with debates that frequently reach national proportions over biases in such 
areas as standardized tests and course offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks contend that standardized tests have long failed to recognize the 
distinctiveness of their culture. For example, a test administered several 
decades ago to both blacks and whites showed that, overall, blacks scored 
higher than whites on "measure of femininity" because they agreed more often 
with such "feminine" choices as "I would like to be a singer" and "I think I 
feel more intensely than most people do." 
</P>
<P>
But as Eric H. Erikson points out in his 1968 book, "Identity: Youth and 
Crisis," to be a singer and to feel intensely "may be facets of a masculine 
ideal gladly admitted if you grew up in a Southern Negro community -- or for 
that matter, in Naples." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Williams, a black psychology professor at Washington University in St. 
Louis, knows the biases of standardized tests first hand. As a sophomore at 
Dunbar High School in Little Rock, Ark., he took an IQ test and scored 82, 
barely above the level achieved by the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the score, his guidance counselor suggested that Williams learn a 
trade, so he studied auto mechanics and bricklaying. After graduation he took a 
job serving hamburgers at a drive-in restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped With Homework 
</P>
<P>
During a break one day, he helped a co-worker with his algebra homework. The 
man was so impressed that he asked Williams where he went to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't smart enough for college," Williams replied. 
</P>
<P>
"You're wrong about that!" the other man said. 
</P>
<P>
The next semester Williams enrolled in Philander Smith College in Little Rock. 
He earned his master's degree at Wayne State University in Detroit. In 1961, he 
became the first black person to win a doctorate in psychology at Washington 
University, where he now teaches. 
</P>
<P>
Williams says that what the IQ test really measured was the great cultural and 
social gap between him and the test's designers. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from a poor family that spoke non-standard English," he said in a 
published interview. "If I was presented with sentences and asked to pick the 
correct one, I chose the one that sounded the way people I knew spoke. To me, 
the sentence, 'I had went down there,' sounded correct. That's how I got an 82 
on the test. Obviously I don't have an 82 IQ, but that was how I seemed to the 
schools. . . . And the same mistakes are still made, if unintentionally, with 
kids every day." 
</P>
<P>
Williams is a prominent figure in the movement for aptitude tests that take 
into account cultural differences of black Americans. But it is a volatile 
issue that, among whites and blacks alike, tends to raise more questions than 
it answers. 
</P>
<P>
In a column last year, for example, syndicated journalist Paul Greenberg asked, 
not altogether facetiously: "How long would it be, one wonders, before those 
designing these new separate-but-equal tests would have to work out the kind of 
cockeyed racial categories that bedeviled practitioners of other forms of 
racial segregation? Would mulattoes take the test for whites or the one for 
blacks? Or half of each? 
</P>
<P>
"Would middle-class blacks from Vermont who wouldn't know June Teenth (a 
reference to blacks' celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation) from July 
the Fourth get their pick of tests? Would all Southerners whose 'life styles' 
include day-long Sunday services, chitlins and watermelon take the black test 
instead of having to wrestle with questions of how to drive on ice and snow?" 
</P>
<P>
Academic course offerings are another source of controversy over how far 
cultural conformity should go. In a move that provoked a furious "great books" 
debate among scholars across the United States, Stanford University decided 
last April to drop a mandatory list of 15 classics in the "Western Culture" 
course it requires of all freshmen, after a growing number of teachers and 
students charged that the list ignored completely the cultural contributions of 
minorities, especially blacks and women. 
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the cultural divide in schools and colleges that is becoming 
a matter of growing concern is the pervasive cultural alienation and isolation 
that black students suffer in predominantly white school settings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sit at Separate Tables 
</P>
<P>
The scene at Homewood High School in suburban Birmingham, Ala., is typical of 
those at many nominally integrated schools across the country. At Homewood, 
where blacks make up 14% of the student population, blacks and whites study 
together in the classrooms and play together on the athletic field. But in the 
cafeteria at lunch, for instance, blacks and whites almost invariably sit at 
separate tables. At school proms, the bands play the music that white students 
-- who are the majority -- favor, leaving blacks feeling -- as one black junior 
put it -- "like outcasts, because it's not what we're used to." 
</P>
<P>
Other factors come into play in creating this disaffection among blacks. For 
example, the lingering racism based on color and class certainly enters the 
picture, since most of the whites are from affluent, middle-class families, 
while many blacks are from lower-income families in a residentially segregated 
part of the community. But the cultural component seems by far the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like there's two different worlds," said Wilbert Pryor, a 16-year-old 
black senior. "There is the school life and there is the social life." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing those separate worlds together in the true sense of integration is no 
easy task. Pervasive patterns of residential segregation throughout the United 
States tend to reinforce racial and cultural boundaries between whites and 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by University of Chicago researchers, for example, showed that 
Asians and Latinos have far greater contact with other races as they move out 
of large U.S. cities and into the suburbs, while blacks still encounter major 
barriers to integration. 
</P>
<P>
This residential separation is behind the still strong patterns of the 
so-called black English that is spoken by many urban black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
William Labov, a linguistics professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an 
authority in the field of black English, says that -- contrary to expectations 
that the black vernacular would become more like standard English under the 
homogenizing influences of television, radio and the movies -- it shows 
evidence of going its own way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a healthy, living form of language," he said in an interview with the New 
York Times. "But separate development is only made possible by separate 
living." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Lankford, a 17-year-old warehouse worker who lives in Atlanta's South 
Side ghetto, knows how strong the barriers of racial and cultural separation 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't live near any whites," he said, "I didn't go to school with any 
whites, I don't have any white friends, and the white guys on the job don't 
even speak to me, much less ask me out to lunch with them." 
</P>
<P>
In an even more ironic development, an apparently growing number of talented 
young blacks are turning their backs on the mainstream world and seeking 
economic opportunities elsewhere that will allow them more freedom to express 
their black cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go into the mainstream," said Michele Booth, a Harvard 
graduate who is now a law student at George Washington University and part-time 
law clerk at a large white law firm in Washington. "I'm tired of being 'white' 
by day and 'black' by night. I want to reintegrate my black identity." 
</P>
<P>
Economic necessity may compel her and others with similar ideals to think 
differently. "When I worked for a black radio station where I could be my 
'real' self, I couldn't (afford to) eat," said Regina Gilmore, 27, the news and 
public affairs director for a country-western radio station in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
C.T. Vivian, a prominent black Atlanta civil rights leader and private 
consultant on human relations, warns that the cultural divide will not be easy 
to bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"What we find," Vivian said, "is that until white people can feel something of 
what black people feel, there is no way to either emotionally or intellectually 
comprehend what blacks go through every day in the land of the free and the 
home of the brave."

HONIG SEES 'SINISTER' DEUKMEJIAN MOTIVES IN PROP. 98 ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig accused Gov. George Deukmejian and 
Administration officials Thursday of having "sinister" motives in their 
campaign to blame the state's budget problems on Proposition 98, the 
school-funding initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, appearing before the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, 
criticized Deukmejian in the strongest terms he has used since the two 
officeholders supposedly patched up their political differences last year. 
</P>
<P>
The schools chief told lawmakers that the real blame for budget woes is an 
inadvertent $1-billion tax cut given to what Honig called "California's 
wealthiest taxpayers" in 1987 tax legislation conforming state and federal tax 
codes. After the tax shortfall turned up last year, Deukmejian acknowledged it 
and briefly proposed raising taxes $800 million to correct the problem. But the 
governor dropped the plan when it received no support in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Honig contends that Deukmejian is "paying off last year's bill" with this 
year's budget revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Health, Welfare' 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody says that Proposition 98 is the cause of this, I think there are 
sinister purposes involved," Honig said. "They would like to see a fight 
between health, welfare and schools, and they would like to get the spotlight 
off where the real problem is, which is the depletion of revenue and these 
mistakes that were made a year, year and a half ago." 
</P>
<P>
The counterattack is part of an effort to head off a campaign by Deukmejian and 
state Finance Director Jesse R. Huff to blame Proposition 98 for the state's 
budget problems and argue for repeal or modification of the school-funding 
measure, along with other laws guaranteeing automatic funding increases to 
state programs. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98 guarantees public schools and community colleges roughly 40% of 
the proposed $38-billion state general fund budget that Deukmejian is proposing 
for the new 1989-90 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, blaming Proposition 98, gave the Legislature a new budget Tuesday 
that saves $337 million by not giving cost-of-living increases that existing 
state law provides for health and welfare program aid recipients. The budget 
action would freeze welfare payments to 1.8 million needy Californians at 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Freeze 
</P>
<P>
Huff, who also appeared at the hearing, said at a budget briefing earlier this 
week that if it had not been for Proposition 98, he would not have proposed the 
budget freeze on health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
Given several opportunities, he did not respond directly to Honig's harshest 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend to stand here and verbally argue numbers with you," Huff told 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Honig's testimony, committee members clearly appeared concerned about 
the impact of Proposition 98 on the budget. Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) said 
that unless modifications are made in legal protections for programs such as 
public schools, the state will soon reach "budget gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, a top University of California official said that unless 
there are amendments made to Proposition 98 and an earlier constitutional 
amendment limiting the size of state government, UC is not going to be able to 
take care of surging student enrollments and maintain the university as it has 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spending Limit 
</P>
<P>
William B. Baker, vice president of budget and university relations, noted that 
every long-range forecast of state revenues shows that the state will be taking 
in more money than it will be allowed to spend because of the spending limit 
approved by voters in 1979 as Proposition 4. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, both Honig and Deukmejian were sharply criticized by 
spokesmen for Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
Eric D. Vega, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said 
during a Capitol news conference that Deukmejian's budget hits "the state's 
least fortunate citizens" the hardest. Declaring that the budget has "teeth," 
he said "the teeth disproportionately chew on poor people and, in particular, 
on the Latino people, the minority people in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo S. Torres of Cafe de California Inc., a Latino state employees 
association, complained that Honig "has done a dismal job of addressing the 
concerns of Hispanic children" in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Torres released a report saying that more Latino children than ever are living 
in poverty and that Latinos have not benefitted as much as blacks or Anglos by 
the economic recovery that began in 1983. He said the governor's budget does 
not effectively deal with the problem.

GOVERNOR CALLS FREEWAY 'SUMMIT'; 
</P>
<P>
SEEKS HELP DEVELOPING PLAN FOR FINANCING NEW HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, Times Sacramento Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling for "bold action to unlock the gridlock on our freeways," Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Thursday invited 27 leaders of business, labor, government and 
the Legislature to a "transportation summit meeting" to begin developing a plan 
to raise more money for highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said his goal is to draft a proposal to offer voters in 1990. The 
plan seems likely to include a combination of bond funding, which the governor 
favors, and a gasoline-tax increase, which is gaining support in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian, speaking at a Los Angeles press conference, vowed unequivocally 
to veto any legislation that would raise the gasoline tax without the voters' 
approval. Such a measure, to raise the gas tax by 10 cents per gallon, was 
proposed in Sacramento on Wednesday by Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) and Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging a serious need for more highway construction money, 
Deukmejian said the "summit" in his office on Feb. 8 should also consider how 
to "make better use of the existing transportation system." He mentioned more 
car-pooling, use of mass transit, staggered work hours and "restricting 
commercial truck traffic on our freeways during peak hours in urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on why he believes trucks should be banned during rush hours, 
Deukmejian said that "whenever there is a major accident involving a large 
commercial-type vehicle, it takes much longer to remove the vehicles that are 
blocking the traffic." Also, he continued, "we should try to get more of a 
24-hour use of the existing system" by running big rigs at night when commuters 
are at home. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea of truck bans needs to be discussed "very thoroughly" with truck 
owners and with businesses that send and receive goods, he added. Any such plan 
must be "feasible" and will require legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There already are rush-hour truck bans in some parts of the state, including 
the Pasadena Freeway north of downtown Los Angeles, California 1 in Ventura, 
California 163 through Balboa Park in San Diego and Interstate 580 in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans spokesman said that trucks make up an average of 8.3% of the total 
vehicles on Los Angeles freeways. But he added that one-fourth of the hours of 
congestion in the state's major metropolitan areas -- Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and San Diego -- is caused by truck accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian sent invitations to his "summit" to representatives of regional 
transportation commissions and local governments, highway user groups, business 
associations, organized labor, his own Administration and legislative leaders 
of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Deukmejian proposed a $1-billion transportation bond issue that 
voters narrowly rejected. The governor said on Thursday that he still favors 
bonds -- which never before have been used to build California highways -- 
because they "spread the cost throughout the entire state and I think everybody 
benefits from an improved transportation network." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he generally opposes increasing the gasoline tax because it 
"falls most heavily on low-income individuals." He added that "people already 
have very high transportation costs -- whether it's for car payments, whether 
it's for insurance, maintaining the vehicle, buying the gasoline. . . . It's 
already a very large percentage of a family budget." 
</P>
<P>
But, emphasizing his willingness to compromise, the Republican governor said: 
"I'm going to be willing to sit down and I'll argue my point. Others will argue 
their point. And I hope we'll be able to come together and reach some kind of 
accord." 
</P>
<P>
The state is facing a deficit of at least $3.5 billion in its five-year, 
$14-billion transportation improvement plan. If new funding sources are not 
found within 18 months, official say, the result will be delayed projects and 
reduced highway maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
On another subject, Deukmejian defended his proposed budget cutbacks in 
programs that serve the poor and women, including a freeze in welfare benefits 
and elimination of state funding for family planning. He reiterated his 
complaint that money that ordinarily would have gone to these programs now must 
be spent on public schools because of Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, California recipients in the Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children program receive "the second-highest level of benefits in the nation." 
And family planning programs can "get funds from other sources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also explained why he advocated in his State of the State address 
Monday that the governor and lieutenant governor run as a ticket, as the 
President and vice president do. Twice recently, Californians have elected a 
governor from one party and a lieutenant governor from another. 
</P>
<P>
While he has "had a good professional relationship" with Democratic Lt. Gov. 
Leo T. McCarthy, Deukmejian said: "We're poles apart philosophically and 
politically. It's not unexpected that I would not turn to him to help us carry 
out some of our policies and programs. I just think it would be so much more 
beneficial to the public to have a person holding that (lieutenant governor's) 
office who was far more involved. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said candidates should run separately for their party's nominations 
-- as they do now -- and then join as a ticket in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
On another matter, the governor said he changed his mind and decided to support 
moving upthe date of California's presidential primary because "political 
leaders feel California should play more of a role" in selecting the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he assumed that during presidential campaign years there would 
be three state elections -- an early presidential primary, a regular June 
primary for state candidates and a November general election. But the governor 
said he would prefer holding the state primary closer to the November election, 
perhaps in September. "It might cut down on some of the campaign costs," he 
said. "Our whole election period is much longer than it needs to be."

DEUKMEJIAN TELLS COURT HE'S NEUTRAL ON 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, 
filing a joint brief with the state Supreme Court, took no stand Thursday on 
the constitutionality of Proposition 103 or its prescribed insurance rate 
rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, they asked the court for guidance on how to interpret the measure if it 
is upheld, particularly with respect to what date any rollbacks that may be 
ruled valid are to be made effective. They also asked for a clear definition 
from the court of what constitutes a "substantial threat of insolvency" that 
may exempt an insurance company from the rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
While Deukmejian and Gillespie, two of the four defendants named in the 
insurance industry's lawsuit to overturn the initiative, stuck to a neutral 
position, the other two defendants, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and the 
State Board of Equalization, submitted a joint brief that defended the measure, 
rollbacks and all. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the split, Van de Kamp, a prospective candidate to succeed 
Deukmejian in the 1990 elections, told a Los Angeles press conference that he 
was "disappointed that the governor is not taking a strong role in defense of 
the will of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor may be neutral on this issue, but I'm not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, speaking at his own press conference nearby an hour before, said 
that he and Gillespie felt that Van de Kamp and other parties -- the insurers 
and other groups filing friend-of-the-court briefs -- would provide the Supreme 
Court with adequate arguments on the constitutional issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready, willing and able to implement all of Proposition 103," the 
governor said. "We're urging the court to make a quick decision and we are 
asking for it to clarify how 103 should be interpreted. . . . We want them to 
give us as much guidance as they can." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he felt this was the "proper role" for him and Gillespie to 
play. Their brief declared they were "mindful of their role as executive 
officers of the state who are constitutionally charged with the responsibility 
of enforcing Proposition 103" and implied that this was a reason they should 
stay out of the fray over the measure's constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the Proposition 103 campaign, accused the 
governor, however, of showing a lack of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"It says about what we've suspected all along," Rosenfield declared. "The 
governor has decided to bail out on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the day set by the Supreme Court as a deadline for defendants of 
Proposition 103 to file briefs answering the industry's lawsuit. In addition to 
the Deukmejian and Van de Kamp filings, briefs also came in from Rosenfield's 
Voter Revolt organization, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn and a coalition 
of 13 citizens groups led by Consumers Union. All of the other briefs urged the 
court to find Proposition 103 constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Its rollback provisions, calling for 20% reductions from 1987 rates in auto, 
homeowners, commercial and other forms of property-casualty insurance and a 
one-year rate freeze, have been stayed by the high court, but other parts of 
the initiative have been allowed to go into effect pending the review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's Brief 
</P>
<P>
The most elaborate presentation came from Van de Kamp, who also submitted a 
lengthy declaration by insurance expert J. Robert Hunter, president of the 
National Insurance Consumer Organization, and a critic of the industry's 
financial claims, to the effect that the insurers have been charging too much 
in California and that the industry is far better able to comply with the 
rollbacks called for in Proposition 103 than it claims to be. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said his own brief could be summarized in just 21 words: "The 
people knew what they were doing when they voted for insurance reform. And what 
they voted for was perfectly legal." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp spoke scathingly about the insurance industry's argument that the 
Supreme Court ought to strike down Proposition 103 because the public would not 
have approved it without the rate rollback provisions that the insurers argue 
are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp called this argument "a blatant attempt to thwart the people's will 
on the flimsiest of pretenses." Major portions of Proposition 103, he argued, 
"are so manifestly constitutional that not even the most fertile minds of 
insurance company lawyers can conjure up a respectable argument against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, they propose that the court throw an entire seven-course meal into 
the garbage if it decides there are too many calories in the dessert. Well, I 
doubt the justices will find that an appetizing suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
As for the rollbacks, the attorney general asserted that insurance company 
profits are at record levels, reserves are often larger than necessary, some 
companies are holding excessive surpluses and that some are wasteful and 
inefficient. Those companies that, nonetheless, cannot afford the rollbacks may 
go to the insurance commissioner for relief under terms of the initiative, he 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
A common strand running through the briefs, except for the one from the 
governor and insurance commissioner, was that both the California Supreme Court 
and other courts have traditionally been loathe to interfere with the people's 
will as expressed in initiatives, except as a last resort. Proposition 103, the 
briefs argue, does not pose issues that would justify such interference. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition 103 campaign's brief, prepared with the assistance of six 
professors from schools of law at the University of California and elsewhere, 
declared: 
</P>
<P>
"This court (is being invited) to indulge in an extraordinary exercise in 
judicial activism. Petitioners, an aggregation of large and powerful insurance 
carriers, seek to completely nullify the will of the voters of this state to 
enact broad-based insurance reform."

BILL TO OUTLAW MILITARY-TYPE GUNS NEARS COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statewide coalition of law enforcement officials, formed last fall to respond 
to what they see as the proliferation of military-type semiautomatic firearms 
among street gangs and drug dealers, has nearly completed the task of drafting 
legislation to outlaw the manufacture and sale of such guns. 
</P>
<P>
As they prepare for a showdown in the Legislature with the powerful gun lobby, 
the coalition -- whose leaders include Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Alameda County Dist. Atty. John J. 
Meehan -- has made passage of the bill its top priority of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"If law enforcement doesn't attempt to do something about it now, we are just 
going to have a whole higher level of arms race in California, and it is going 
to be extremely dangerous for innocent people," said Richard Inglehart, an 
Alameda County prosecutor and member of the task force drafting the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is aimed at semiautomatic rifles like the Uzi, AK-47 and AR-15, 
available over the counter to anyone 18 or older who provides identification 
and fills out a form declaring that he is not a drug addict, a fugitive or a 
mentally unstable person. By contrast, purchasers of handguns must wait 15 days 
for a state background investigation before taking possession of their 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
A bruising fight with the politically powerful National Rifle Assn. and the Gun 
Owners of California seems assured. Traditionally, the Legislature has been 
reluctant to enact anything that smacks of controls on guns or firearm 
ownership. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. once observed that in California, 
"you don't mess with a man's guns or cars." 
</P>
<P>
"It will be one of the donnybrooks of the legislative session," predicted Gary 
Mullen, executive director of the California District Attorneys Assn., of the 
campaign that will pit the NRA against the police. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist David Marshall of the NRA, a veteran of previous unsuccessful attempts 
to outlaw military-type semiautomatics, maintains that a prohibition against 
such firearms will not deter criminals intent on getting them but will work to 
the disadvantage of law-abiding Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave the law-abiding citizen alone," he said. "Go after the criminals and 
nail them to the wall and stop treating them with kid gloves. Get them off the 
streets. Give them mandatory jail time. No plea-bargaining. No probation. No 
parole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Military Type 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the weapon of choice for drug dealers and street gangs is the 
military-style semiautomatic gun that often is easily concealed and can be 
converted to a full automatic. At semiautomatic, the rifle fires one bullet at 
a time as fast as the trigger is pulled. On automatic, one squeeze sends out a 
stream of fire like a machine gun's. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law sponsored by the NRA, it is illegal in California to convert a 
semiautomatic to a full automatic. Likewise, it is illegal to possess a machine 
gun without a permit from the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The drafters of the proposed law enforcement gun bill say they are close to 
agreement on language in the bill that would outlaw the manufacture and sale of 
certain "bad guns" but exempt "good guns" -- those used by hunters, competitive 
target shooters and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is in distinguishing between semiautomatic military weapons and 
the semiautomatic rifles and shotguns used by sportsmen, because all operate on 
basically the same principle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Definition 
</P>
<P>
The bill would establish a broad generic definition that would fit military 
assault-type semiautomatics and be based on such things as the length of barrel 
and size of the bullet magazine. Some existing weapons would actually be banned 
by name. However, certain sporting guns that may resemble the prohibited 
firearms would be exempted by name. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would allow manufacturers of the military-style weapons to 
obtain a permit to sell the guns that is similar to what is required for 
machine guns. In general, however, they would not be allowed to sell to 
civilian outlets in California. 
</P>
<P>
A commission would be created to approve or reject new guns that come on the 
market in the future. The commission, as yet of unspecified membership, could 
add prohibited guns to the list, which sponsors said would be short, at least 
initially. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has undergone at least 10 drafts, is expected to be introduced 
next month. No legislator has yet been asked to carry the measure, proponents 
said, although Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) has 
promised to author such a bill. 
</P>
<P>
Strategists for the task force conceded that assuring hunters, collectors and 
sportsmen that their guns are "safe" and would not be affected by the bill is a 
key element in winning its approval by a Legislature highly sensitive to 
gun-owning constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure the bill doesn't affect hunters and sportsmen, even 
though the NRA will take it on and be opposed to it," said prosecutor 
Inglehart. "But there are some guns that are not designed or meant to be used 
for hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Block, an outspoken opponent of semiautomatic assault weapons, said he 
believes there is a need to "selectively regulate and, if necessary, prohibit 
certain kinds of weaponry in the interests of public safety. These weapons are 
legally available. People have exercised what is a right under the law (to 
purchase them) and I think the law has to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired Senator Active 
</P>
<P>
Joining in the fight against the legislation will be the Gun Owners of 
California, a political action committee headed by retired Sen. H. L. 
Richardson. The Glendora Republican now is in the business of producing 
conservative political videos. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said he intends to blanket the state with thousands of videos 
opposing the legislation, just as he did when he campaigned for the defeat of 
former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Gun control advocates, who were active in earlier attempts to outlaw 
military-type semiautomatic rifles, have made the tactical decision to remain 
on the sidelines in this struggle. For many gun owners and legislators, gun 
control is a code phrase for confiscating firearms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking our cue from law enforcement and looking to them for leadership 
on this issue," said Louis Tolley, state director of Handgun Control Inc. "We 
are very anxious to support them. They have the expertise in defining these 
assault weapons and how best to restrict them. We don't have that expertise."

CHINA DISSIDENT URGES POLITICAL AMNESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent dissident, said Thursday that a worldwide 
trend toward greater freedom gives him hope that China may soon release many of 
its political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In a bold challenge to the Chinese leadership, Fang has written to paramount 
leader Deng Xiao-ping with an appeal that he announce a general amnesty. In the 
letter, made available to reporters this week, Fang placed particular emphasis 
on the release of Wei Jingsheng, the country's most famous political prisoner, 
who has spent nearly 10 years in confinement and is reputed to be in poor 
health. 
</P>
<P>
"The authorities, especially Deng Xiaoping, should be able to see how far 
Chinese society has progressed over the past two years," Fang said Thursday in 
an interview with The Times. "He must be aware of progress made in the whole 
world, especially improvements in the Soviet Union last year -- the release of 
political prisoners, political reforms, glasnost and so forth. This sort of 
thing is a rising tide throughout the world. So I think there is a possibility 
that he can accept this proposal." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Fang notes that 1989 is the 40th anniversary of the founding of 
the People's Republic of China and the 70th anniversary of the May 4th 
Movement, a student-led struggle to bring greater democracy to China. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to propose to you . . . that you use the occasion of the approach 
of these two anniversaries to announce a general amnesty within China, and in 
particular to release Wei Jingsheng and all other political prisoners," Fang 
wrote. "Regardless of how one might evaluate Wei Jingsheng as a person, to 
release someone like him, who has already served nearly a decade in prison, in 
my view would be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect on 
our social morale . . . . I entreat you . . . to consider my proposal and to 
give a new emphasis to the dawning of our future." 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's interview, Fang said his suggestion is practical because "an 
amnesty is just a very small step -- it's not like allowing freedom of speech, 
or ending restrictions on political parties." 
</P>
<P>
Fang is a respected astrophysicist who was expelled from the Communist Party in 
early 1987 for allegedly instigating pro-democracy student demonstrations. The 
fame engendered by his loss of party membership has contributed to his 
emergence as China's most visible advocate of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Fang thus is a successor to Wei, who won fame with a December, 1978, wallposter 
entitled "Democracy: The Fifth Modernization," playing off the slogan of a 
government campaign of that period to modernize four aspects of society: 
industry, agriculture, science and and technology and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Wei, an electrician who edited a dissident journal, was arrested the following 
March. Later that year, he was convicted of writing "counterrevolutionary and 
reactionary" wallposters and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what Wei said in 1978 finds considerable support among Chinese 
intellectuals today, and some of the boldest, such as Fang, now get away with 
saying it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm going past what they were saying then," Fang acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fang said that some intellectuals feel that Wei did make punishable mistakes, 
while others think he did nothing wrong. But there is widespread agreement that 
he has been imprisoned too long and should be released, Fang said. 
</P>
<P>
Wei's release thus would serve to ease some of the tension between the 
government and intellectuals that has existed since the "anti-bourgeois 
liberalization" campaign of early 1987, Fang said. That campaign came after 
pro-democracy student demonstrations in late 1986 provoked a backlash by 
orthodox hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Fang himself, after being allowed to travel to Hong Kong and Australia last 
fall, was denied permission to make a scheduled trip to the United States late 
last year. This was widely viewed as punishment for outspoken comments he made 
in Hong Kong and Australia. Fang said he has reapplied to visit the United 
States, and also has sought permission to accept invitations to visit Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Fang said Thursday that although he faces punitive restrictions on travel and 
lecturing, which interfere with his life as a scientist, he is in a far safer 
situation than Wei was a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one cannot say that I face no danger," Fang said, "but the danger is 
much less than in the past. This is the result of what intellectuals have won . 
. . in the past 10 years, and the result of developments in China and the whole 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Fang also acknowledged that his visibility helps to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge students not to say too much, because it's too dangerous," he said. "I 
say, 'Don't be like me.' But I feel that I can speak out. I should try to make 
use of the conditions that allow me to speak. I must speak my mind and try to 
accomplish whatever I can."

Sikhs waging a separatist war in Punjab killed 36 people, hanging four in 
revenge for the executions of two Sikhs convicted in the assassination of Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths bring the number of people killed in Punjab so far this year 
to more than 90. At least 2,400 people were killed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The two Sikhs, Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, were hanged Jan. 6 in New Delhi 
for the murder of Gandhi, who was shot down Oct. 31, 1984, by Sikh members of 
her personal bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
Police superintendent Govind Ram said the headman of Bhujiawali village and his 
three brothers, all Hindus, were kidnaped Wednesday night by five Sikhs and 
found hanging from trees the next morning. He said a note claimed 
responsibility for a Sikh militia. 
</P>
<P>
Others killed Thursday were a Hindu couple and their two daughters and another 
Hindu couple; Sikh farmer Fakir Singh, his son and nephew, and seven others 
killed in separate attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Chandigarh, the state capital, said 16 more people were reported 
killed Wednesday night.

REBELS TARGET U.S.-AIDED PROGRAM IN RURAL EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A guerrilla policy of terrorizing mayors and other local officials, including 
the assassination of eight civic leaders and the forced resignation of at least 
39 others, is threatening an American-sponsored program aimed at winning rural 
Salvadorans to the government side. 
</P>
<P>
The program, supported by millions of dollars in economic assistance, combines 
low-intensity fighting with efforts to provide government services in areas 
where the leftist guerrillas are most active. 
</P>
<P>
But because of Salvadoran military inefficiency and doubts about the program, 
the Salvadoran army has been reluctant to implement the low-intensity tactics 
-- search and kill patrols by small units, usually at night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in the view of U.S. advisers, the Salvadoran army stays close to its 
barracks, declining to set up night ambushes and failing to pursue the 
guerrillas when contact is made. Also, although it has improved its human 
rights record, the army has still not convinced rural Salvadorans that it is 
any less dangerous to them than the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 6,000 guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front -- the FMLN, it is usually called, after its initials in Spanish -- has 
been left free to roam the countryside, causing severe economic and morale 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the resignations of so many officials, the civic action part of the 
program is also in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government can't protect the mayors, the guerrillas will prove that 
they are in control, and that means that the people, who didn't have much faith 
in the capital to begin with, will have no choice but to stand by the FMLN," a 
diplomatic source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
The resignations have only made a bad situation worse. Even before they began, 
in the middle of last month, 51 of the 262 mayor's offices were vacant because 
no one could be found who was willing to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, eight mayors were killed by the guerrillas. In many areas, mayors 
will not live or work in their own towns for fear of being killed. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the mayoral posts are now vacant. This causes difficulty on 
several levels, observers say. Not only is it evidence of government weakness 
and guerrilla strength; it also tends to deprive peasants of such needed 
services as drinkable water, electric power, schools, medical facilities, 
transportation and the means of distributing food. 
</P>
<P>
Without a working mayor and council, the municipalities cannot receive the 
financial aid provided by the United States and administered by the Salvadoran 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect way to win hearts and minds," a foreign expert said. "If you 
give them water, a good road, a school and an army that doesn't kill them, then 
they will be on your side." 
</P>
<P>
This is what led the FMLN to begin threatening and killing officials. The 
rebels have little in the way of a substitute program, so they have chosen to 
terrorize rather than attempt to convert. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the FMLN sent letters to a number of mayors accusing them of 
collaborating with the government but conceding that some were unwitting 
collaborators. The mayors were given a month to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Then, beginning in mid-December, more letters were sent out, saying there would 
be no more grace time and that any mayor who did not resign would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the example of the eight slain mayors, along with the lack of 
military protection and the low pay, about $100 a month, eliminated the 
incentive to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Emilio Ponce, the army chief of staff, would not acknowledge, in an 
interview, that the program is in danger of failing, but he said it was 
impossible to guard all the municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are supposed to protect the roads, the coffee plantations, the cities and 
the mayors and at the same time fight the terrorists," he said. "It can't all 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
And there is another dimension to all this. Half of the dead mayors and more 
than half of those who quit were members of the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, or Arena party, a rightist political party that has been accused of 
being involved with the death squads that were active here a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the party, including former Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, have charged 
the centrist Christian Democratic government with being soft on the guerrillas 
and not aggressively seeking out the rebels and their sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violence Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Former Col. Sigifredo Ochoa, an Arena party member of the National Assembly, 
has said repeatedly that if the mayors are not protected "there is going to be 
a lot of violence" in the weeks leading up to the March 20 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Arena party leaders charge that the threats and killings are part of an FMLN 
plot to scare people into voting for the leftist Democratic Convergence, a 
coalition of socialist and other leftist parties that has nominated a 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Because leaders of the convergence are allied with the FMLN, these Arena 
charges are seen as suggestions that Arena supporters may be targeting the 
coalition's leaders, particularly presidential candidate Guillermo Ungo. Last 
month a right-wing death squad threatened to kill Ungo.

China has agreed to have direct talks with Vietnam next month on a possible 
settlement of the Cambodian guerrilla war, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of a 
key Cambodian leader, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The talks would bring together the two principal non-Cambodian forces in the 
decade-long conflict for the first time since momentum toward a settlement 
began building two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I have just learned that China has agreed to receive Vietnam's minister or 
deputy minister of foreign affairs in early February," Ranariddh said in a 
statement broadcast by the radio station of the Cambodian resistance faction 
headed by his father, Norodom Sihanouk. Foreign Ministers Siddhi Savetsila of 
Thailand and Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam concluded two days of talks in Hanoi on 
Wednesday with a joint statement saying that "both sides agreed that it was 
necessary for them to work together in accelerating the process toward 
achieving a political solution to the Cambodian problem." 
</P>
<P>
The two sides, until now ardent antagonists on the issue, made no mention of 
Hanoi-Beijing talks. 
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said in his broadcast, which was monitored here and reported in the 
Bangkok press, that the Soviet Union had asked Chinese officials to meet with a 
Vietnamese delegation and that Moscow would initiate talks with Sihanouk if 
there is a Sino-Vietnamese meeting. The Cambodian issue has been a major 
stumbling block in Moscow's efforts to improve relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
China has sponsored the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the conflict, while the 
Soviets have backed the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hanoi officials said the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from 
Cambodia could take place as early as September if outside military aid to the 
resistance guerrillas is halted. But they attached conditions that have been 
unacceptable to the resistance and its allies.

'SPECIAL' RULE IMPOSED ON ARMENIA ENCLAVE

The Soviet central government announced Thursday that it is temporarily 
imposing "a special form of administration" on the predominantly Armenian 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in an effort to end months of ethnic tension 
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the top governmental 
body, gave no details about the new administration but affirmed that 
Nagorno-Karabakh will remain part of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The 
Armenian population of the enclave has been agitating for a year to unite the 
area with the Armenian republic, which is mainly Christian, instead of staying 
under the control of Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to end some of the ethnic tension in the region, the Presidium 
went into session Thursday to discuss what a government statement called 
"urgent" questions. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said the leadership "found it expedient to 
temporarily introduce in the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region a special form 
of administration, with Nagorno-Karabakh retaining its status as an autonomous 
region incorporated in Azerbaijan." 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the announcement appeared to indicate that the authorities had 
decided once again to reject the Armenians' demands that the enclave be 
administratively united with Armenia. It did not say how long the temporary 
measures would last. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the move has the "aim of preventing a continued aggravation 
of inter-ethnic relations and stabilizing the situation in the region." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two republics met in Moscow on Wednesday and said in a joint 
statement that urgent measures should be taken to calm the situation in the 
region, where an estimated 78 people have been killed in the ethnic violence 
since last February. 
</P>
<P>
The violence has left about 43 people dead since last November alone, according 
to the Communist Party newspaper Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 160,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis fled Armenia during the unrest.

SOVIET MENTAL HOSPITALS HOLD NO POLITICAL PRISONERS, DOCTOR SAYS

A key Soviet psychiatrist said Thursday that there are no patients in Soviet 
mental hospitals for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy Marozov, chairman of the Scientific Society of Psychiatrists and 
Neuropathologists, made the statement on the heels of Soviet assurances that 
Soviet authorities are no longer holding political prisoners in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no patients in mental hospitals in the U.S.S.R. who are there for 
political reasons," Marozov told Tass, the Soviet news agency. "The 
conscientiousness and competence of individual physicians can perhaps be 
questioned, but I rule out the possibility of deliberately wrong diagnoses." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moscow's chief psychiatrist said he had recommended the release of 
the last four patients being held for anti-Soviet activity. The four had been 
charged with violating Articles 70 and 190 of the Soviet legal code, which 
prohibit anti-Soviet propaganda and dissemination of anti-Soviet slander. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Tikhonenko, the chief psychiatric physician for Moscow, said in an 
interview that the four "have mental problems, but their condition does not 
warrant their continued isolation and forced treatment." 
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the four might have been released. 
</P>
<P>
Marozov said the Ministry of Health recently received from the United States a 
list of the names of 48 political prisoners in Soviet asylums, and he said the 
Soviets are "thoroughly studying" it. 
</P>
<P>
He said a group of American psychiatrists are to visit the Soviet Union next 
month to check on possible human rights violations at Soviet hospitals. He said 
they will be allowed to "familiarize themselves with the state of these 
patients and their course of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets maintain that any patients in asylums against their will are there 
only because doctors have diagnosed mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Marozov said that lists of political prisoners sent from abroad frequently 
refer to people who are not in Sovet asylums or even residing in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Measures for revamping the procedure of registration and observation of mental 
cases are now being implemented in the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitoring organization, 
has said that the practice of confining dissidents in mental institutions has 
dramatically declined since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government issued a decree that gave as the sole criterion for 
forced confinement a person's threat to his own and society's safety.

PRO-ISRAEL LOBBYING GROUP ACCUSED OF PAC VIOLATIONS 
</P>

<P>
The nation's chief pro-Israel lobbying group was accused Thursday of widespread 
election-law violations in a complaint filed by former U.S. officials 
associated with the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In requesting an investigation by the Federal Election Commission, former 
Undersecretary of State George Ball, former Rep. Paul Findley (R-Ill.) and 
others charged that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee illegally 
helped numerous pro-Israel political action committees make excessive 
contributions to congressional candidates in 1984, 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its initials, AIPAC is not registered as a money-giving PAC and 
maintains that it does not endorse candidates or help funnel money to 
campaigns. However, the 174-page complaint cites internal memos and the 
presence of AIPAC officers on many pro-Israel political action committees as 
evidence that AIPAC coordinates donations made by the PACs, action that would 
violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, filed to support the interests of the frequently divided and 
disorganized American Arab community, represents one of the most significant 
challenges yet to the power of AIPAC. AIPAC's lobbying for aid to Israel -- and 
against aid to her enemies -- is widely considered the most effective in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The action could prompt an examination of AIPAC's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Abdeen Jabara, president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 
said that it is "the fervent desire" of his 23,000-member organization to 
"trigger a full and thorough investigation of AIPAC's role in the American 
political process." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, AIPAC scoffed at the allegations and said that the 
174-page complaint is "based almost exclusively upon press clippings and 
supposed quotations." The group said that it is confident an FEC investigation 
would find its actions lawful. 
</P>
<P>
An FEC official, who declined to be identified, predicted that the six-member 
commission would agree to an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries into similar allegations in other cases led to modest civil fines 
against the American Medical Assn. and a group associated with Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.), the official said. He speculated that, if adverse action were taken 
against AIPAC, the practical effect on campaign contributions by pro-Israel 
groups would be slight. 
</P>
<P>
"These things usually result in a book-keeping shuffle, with the money being 
merely shifted around and sent by a different route," he said. "However, in 
this case, it might force AIPAC to be more visible." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint follows the recent indictment of Los Angeles businessman Michael 
R. Goland, a pro-Israel activist. Goland is charged with illegally funneling 
campaign contributions to benefit the 1986 campaign of Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), a strong supporter of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Goland, who once was associated with AIPAC and has had ties with Washington 
PAC, a pro-Israel group, also was fined by the FEC for failing to identify 
himself as the sponsor of television ads in 1984 that were critical of former 
Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Ill.) -- not one of Israel's staunchest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Sign Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ball and Findley, signers of the complaint against AIPAC included 
Retired Rear Adm. Robert Hanks, former commander of the U.S. fleet stationed in 
the Persian Gulf; James E. Aikens, former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia; 
Andrew I. Killgore, former U.S. ambassador to Qatar; Richard Curtiss, a former 
U.S. Information Agency official who is now editor of the Washington Report on 
Middle East Affairs, and Orin Parker, president of Amideast, a U.S. educational 
and development organization operating in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Killgore said in a statement that "congressmen and senators are terrified to 
oppose the wishes of AIPAC, as almost any of them privately affirm. The very 
welfare of the United States depends on exposing the machinations of AIPAC, 
which takes its direction from the state of Israel, not from America."

U.S. ADMITS DISREPAIR AT NUCLEAR PLANTS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The government's nuclear weapons production plants have been allowed to 
deteriorate so badly over the last 25 years that at least four of them probably 
will have to be closed permanently and the rest will require at least $81 
billion in repairs and cleanup, the Reagan Administration acknowledged 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The current complex of 15 plants that build and service the nation's nuclear 
bombs and warheads are no longer either environmentally safe or secure against 
terrorist threats, the Administration said in a report. In addition, "public 
opposition" to nuclear work in heavily populated areas has made some of the 
plants, particularly the heavily contaminated Rocky Flats facility near Denver, 
not worth spending the money to improve, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The report, written by a panel of officials from the Energy Department and the 
Pentagon, contains little information that has not already been released but is 
the most comprehensive Administration public statement to date on the 
production plants' problems. 
</P>
<P>
Its recommendations, stressing the need for more repairs and investment along 
with some plant closings, are not binding on the new Administration. 
President-elect Bush, speaking to reporters after announcing that retired Adm. 
James D. Watkins will be his energy secretary, said that he would not 
necessarily accept its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not committed to any report," Bush said, adding that he would ask 
Watkins, whose new department runs the weapons plants, to "immediately take a 
look" at the problems of the weapons plants. The increased money the report 
recommends would amount to a 50% increase in the budget for the nuclear program 
for the next 20 years, an increase that will be difficult to fit into Bush's 
plan for a "flexible freeze" on government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if further study of the issue might not increase risks of public harm or 
environmental damage, Bush replied: "I think there's a risk if we imprudently 
go forward (before) he and I have had a chance to take a hard look." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, saying that he had not yet had a chance to look at the report, told 
reporters that the Navy's experience with reactors proves that nuclear programs 
can be run safely. "And its about time to demonstrate to the American people we 
can do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean Bill of Health 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the plants that process uranium for Navy reactors were about the only 
part of the nation's production complex that received a clean bill of health in 
the document. The rest of the plants, which make tritium -- a radioactive gas 
-- for hydrogen bombs, process plutonium and construct the bombs all pose 
problems, it said. 
</P>
<P>
No immediate changes were recommended at the government's three nuclear weapons 
laboratories, which include the University of California's Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory. But because of increased population around the lab, 
located about 30 miles inland from Oakland, future expansion should be 
channeled to "a more remote site," the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The study called for substantial changes at the plants that make tritium, which 
decays rapidly, requiring a steady resupply to keep nuclear bombs ready for 
use. Those plants, all at the Savannah River facility in South Carolina, are 
all now shut down and probably will not be able to reopen until the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems, the report concluded, were caused by federal budget cuts 
that deferred maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that the plants, mostly built in the 1950s and mid-1960s, 
"are rapidly reaching the end of their useful lives." Modernizing them will 
cost at least $52 billion over the next 20 years, the report said. In addition, 
another $29 billion will be needed to clean up environmental hazards, which 
include radioactive wastes at some plants and toxic chemicals at others. 
</P>
<P>
Along with modernization, the report suggests consolidation of the weapons 
plants, concentrating them in a few sites that are remote from population 
centers.

BLACK RENTERS MET BIAS IN SAN DIEGO APARTMENT SURVEY 
</P>

<P>
Blacks seeking to rent apartments in seven sections of San Diego faced some 
form of discrimination 40% of the time, according to a covert test of the 
housing market presented to the city's Housing Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 of 35 locations, black test renters seeking apartments were treated 
differently from white test renters who applied for the same apartments on the 
same day, according to the report by the Urban League of San Diego, which 
conducted the test for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
While housing officials stressed that the test sample was too small to 
generalize the results to the entire city, "the survey served its purpose of 
giving a very good indication that there is discrimination out there," said 
Evan Becker, the commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, the commission's new chairman, called for wider testing 
of the rental market. 
</P>
<P>
The study was part of a larger report by the city's Fair Housing Task Force, 
which also concluded that San Diego has racially and ethnically segregated 
housing patterns, an imbalance that is partially attributable to low-income 
housing programs enacted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Poor whites are more broadly scattered about the city than poor minority 
groups, and blacks suffer more segregation than Latinos, who are more 
segregated than Asians, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords and rental agents discriminated most frequently by misrepresenting 
the availability of apartments, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"White testers were given immediate dates and shown several apartments, as 
opposed to the black testers, who were given two weeks to one month for a unit 
to become available and a lesser number of apartments for consideration," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
At one apartment, a white renter was given information on 10 apartments and 
told that one was available immediately. A black renter at the same apartment 
house was given information on only one apartment and told that none was 
available immediately. In all, the study documented 11 cases of misrepresented 
apartment availability. 
</P>
<P>
The report also documented five examples of differing levels of courtesy to 
white and black renters, ranging from "very subtle to being outright rude." 
</P>
<P>
But some examples of discrimination were more subtle. Two cases pertained to 
more extensive questioning of black renters' marital status, and one involved a 
black renter receiving a much more detailed description of the rigor of the 
upcoming credit check. 
</P>
<P>
"Differential treatment is differential treatment," said Joan Dahlin, senior 
program analyst on the project for the commission, who said that such subtle 
discrimination has a "chilling effect" on blacks' search for rental housing.

THERAPY USING SODIUM FLUORIDE STRENGTHENS BONES, DOCTOR SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An experimental treatment that promotes bone growth appears to strengthen the 
backbones of women who have suffered spinal fractures due to osteoporosis, 
researchers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves giving patients a slow-release form of sodium fluoride 
-- the compound dentists use to fight tooth decay -- and calcium supplements, 
said Dr. Charles Y. C. Pak, chief of mineral metabolism at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. His findings are being published 
in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that "intermittent sodium fluoride therapy is safe and 
produces objective and clinical improvement in patients with osteoporosis," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Spinal osteoporosis is a condition of progressive bone loss that affects 5 
million Americans -- primarily older women. The most severely afflicted are at 
greatly increased risk for spinal fractures and hip fractures; some are 
confined to wheelchairs or can only walk with assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment is intended to make the existing bone stronger but it cannot 
correct already fractured bone," Pak said at a news conference. "The hope is 
that it will make the remaining bone strong enough so it could withstand 
further fractures." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment attempts to reverse the loss of so-called spongy bone that makes 
up the vertebrae of the spinal column. Pak said he does not think the fluoride 
therapy will be of major value in patients with fractures of the hip or other 
long bones since they contain very little spongy material. 
</P>
<P>
Pak explained that other commonly used osteoporosis treatments, such as 
estrogens and calcium supplements, were useful in preventing the development of 
bone loss if they were begun during the early phase of menopause. But they are 
of limited value for individuals who have already sustained substantial bone 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Pak's research team measured the effects of the new therapy on 38 
post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and six men; the mean duration of 
treatment was about three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen an average of 3% to 6% a year increase in (spinal) bone and a 
continued increase every year," he said. The treatment also appeared to 
decrease the frequency of spinal fractures.

COSTA RICA WILL PRESERVE FORESTS IN EXCHANGE FOR REDUCTION OF DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In what was called the largest private "debt-for-nature" swap to date, the 
government of Costa Rica has agreed to take new steps to save its vanishing 
tropical forests in exchange for a reduction in its foreign debt, it was 
disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced in Washington, Costa Rica will not have to repay a 
$5.6-million loan it owed the American Express Bank. The bank wrote off the 
loan as a bad debt, took a tax deduction and sold the debt paper to the Nature 
Conservancy, a Washington-based private, nonprofit conservation organization, 
for $784,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy and another private environmental group in Costa Rica 
then renegotiated the loan with the government. Under the new terms, the 
government will owe $1.7 million plus interest, which will be used to issue 
Costa Rican currency bonds that will finance the tropical forest preservation 
project as well as other conservation measures involving 355,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange is the fifth such transaction and part of a developing trend in 
dealing with Third World debt while encouraging conservation of what are coming 
to be known as the "global commons," precious natural resources that are 
critical links in preventing or minimizing worldwide environmental problems 
such as global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Third World countries collectively owe $1.3 trillion in foreign debt and many 
are forced to service that debt by exploiting natural resources to earn hard 
currency to repay their loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The monumental environmental problems facing the world are going to require 
creative solutions," Jeff Wise of the Nature Conservancy said Thursday in a 
telephone interview from Washington. "Debt for nature . . . is a model for 
imaginative ways of dealing with the unimaginable -- the loss of a large 
portion of the world's animal species." 
</P>
<P>
He added that as debt-for-nature transactions increase in size, more indebted 
countries may be encouraged to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, a $30-million government-to-government debt-for-nature 
exchange was negotiated in Costa Rica by the Dutch government, while the World 
Wildlife Fund put together a $5.4-million package. Such exchanges were 
recommended late last year to President-elect Bush in an extensive review of 
environmental issues funded by major U.S. corporations and foundations. Ecuador 
has also made provisions for such exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
While Costa Rica has the most extensive park system in the developing world 
with 11% of its land in national parks and another 14% in some protective 
status, it experiences the highest deforestation rates outside its parks of any 
country in the Western Hemisphere, the Nature Conservancy said. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 4% of Costa Rica's total forest cover is lost to development. If 
that trend continues for a decade, the conservancy said, there would be no 
productive forest outside protected areas. 
</P>
<P>
Each year tropical forests covering an area the size of Austria are cleared and 
burned to make way for housing, agriculture and other development, according to 
Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute. That amounts to 54 acres each 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated, for example, that the burning of rain forests for 
development and agriculture contributes as much as 20% of the total human 
contribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a major 
contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, a postulated international 
warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tropical forests are significant reservoirs of biological 
diversity. It has been estimated that 75% of all species on Earth are located 
in tropical regions. 
</P>
<P>
Assisting the Nature Conservancy in purchasing the $5.6-million Costa Rican 
debt were the Stroud Foundation; the Noyes Foundation; the W. Alton Jones 
Foundation; the MacArthur Foundation; the World Wildlife Fund; the National 
Parks Foundation of Costa Rica; the government of Holland; the Swedish Society 
for the Conservation of Nature, and the People's Trust for Endangered Speces 
based in Great Britain.

20 ROBBERIES OF WOMEN IN VALLEY MAY BE RELATED 
</P>

As many as 20 armed robberies that netted more than $250,000 in jewelry, in 
which motorists in expensive cars were followed to their hillside homes in the 
San Fernando Valley and held up, appear to be related, Los Angeles police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The victims have mostly been women between 40 and 70 years old who were driving 
alone, usually in Mercedes-Benzes, police said. The robbers took cash and 
jewelry after the victims had parked at their homes, police said. No one has 
been injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies have occurred from Sherman Oaks to Woodland Hills but primarily 
in Encino neighborhoods, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is creating a great deal of anxiety in the community," Police Lt. William 
Gaida said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 30, a woman was followed to her Encino home and robbed after leaving a 
nail salon, where she and other customers had been discussing the robberies, 
Detective Randy Fredrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim said she frequently looked in her rear-view mirror and, at one 
point, thought she was being followed, Fredrickson said. However, when it 
appeared that the car turned off, she continued home, he said. But after 
parking in her garage, she was robbed by a gunman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are investigating whether five similar robberies in West Los 
Angeles, including one where a victim was shot and wounded, are connected. 
</P>
<P>
A man and woman arrested Wednesday in another series of robberies, in which 
victims were followed home from Studio City, are not suspected in the hillside 
cases, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley crimes appear to be the work of three sets of robbers, police said. 
However, the method used has been so similar that investigators believe that 
the robberies may be linked. 
</P>
<P>
"They may know each other. They may come from the same neighborhood. They may 
be using the same fence" to sell stolen jewelry, Detective Chris Biller said. 
</P>
<P>
In each robbery, the victim was followed by two men from areas near Sepulveda 
Boulevard and Mulholland Drive or from areas along Ventura Boulevard, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the robbers struck on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, arrested when he tried to enter Zaire under 
an assumed name last week, boarded a private plane to return to his exile home 
in Saudi Arabia. Amin, who is wanted by the Ugandan government for the torture 
and murder of an estimated 250,000 people during his eight-year rule, is 
believed to have been trying to make his way back to neighboring Uganda, where 
residents say he has a force of 500 guerrillas camped along the Zairian border 
awaiting his orders. A high-ranking Ugandan Foreign Ministry official had 
called for Amin's extradition to Kampala to answer for thousands of atrocities, 
but Zaire chose to deport him instead.

French police arrested 10 Spanish Basque militants, including Jose Antonio 
Urutigoechea, considered by Madrid to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque 
separatist organization ETA, French authorities said in Bayonne. Spanish 
officials, party leaders and newspapers hailed the arrest of Urutigoechea, 38, 
and said Spain will seek his extradition. Urutigoechea, better known by the 
nickname Josu Ternera, is regarded as the top man and the toughest hard-liner 
in ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), a guerrilla group that has killed more 
than 600 people in a 21-year campaign for Basque independence from Spain. 
Basque regional President Jose Antonio Ardanza said the group could react with 
a vengeance.

The government of Sri Lanka's President Ranasinghe Premadasa released 234 
political prisoners who were held without trial under emergency regulations 
that ended this week, officials said. The day before, Premadasa ordered an end 
to the state of emergency imposed in 1983 to confront a rebellion in the north 
and east by Hindu Tamils fighting for independence. Officials said about 1,500 
political prisoners will soon be freed under the new regulations.

Chile's Supreme Court named a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of 
torture of children and other human rights abuses at a secretive colony of 
German immigrants in the Andean foothills 250 miles south of Santiago. West 
Germany, which says it has evidence that settlers are mistreated and virtually 
imprisoned by colony leaders, has been pressing for more than a year for an 
investigation of the settlement, founded in 1961 by Paul Schaeffer, a former 
German army nurse. Schaeffer was forced to flee his homeland after being 
accused of child abuse at a home he ran there.

A kidnap and robbery suspect mistakenly freed from the San Bernardino Central 
Detention Center has been captured in Golden Beach, Md. Dorinda Carol White, 
21, of Leonard Town, Md., was arrested by state troopers and is awaiting 
extradition to Las Vegas in the kidnaping of a flower shop employee, San 
Bernardino County sheriff's deputies said. A "computer glitch" led to White's 
release from the San Bernardino jail, officers said. A car carrying White and 
her companion, James Manning McRay, 21, was stopped routinely in Barstow on 
Dec. 23 by California Highway Patrol officers. Arrests were made after another 
woman in the car screamed that she had been kidnaped, the CHP said. Because of 
a computer error, White and McRay were transferred from Barstow to San 
Bernardino without booking papers indicating that they were wanted in Las 
Vegas, deputies said. White was freed Saturday. McRay's paper work, however, 
showed that he was wanted in Maryland and he remained jailed.

Allie Hill is 105 years old today. So is her identical twin sister Maggie 
Lambeth. Ask them the secret of their longevity, and they'll reply: "Chew gum." 
The fact that neither one has a tooth in her head nor wears dentures apparently 
doesn't faze them. Hill and Lambeth have lived all their lives within a few 
miles of each other in rural Davidson County, N.C. In fact, neither woman has 
ever been out of the county, not even to shop in nearby Winston-Salem. Between 
them they have 16 children, 48 grandchildren, 85 great-grandchildren and 31 
great-great-grandchildren. Not surprisingly, the Guinness Book of World Records 
lists the sisters as the oldest twins in the world. Meanwhile, in Davisburg, 
Mich., the L'Esperance quintuplets -- Alexandria, Danielle, Erica, Veronica and 
Raymond -- celebrated their first birthdays this week. Maybe their mother, 
Michele, should buy them each a pack of gum.

 -- Chalk up a small victory for women's rights in Iran. One of the three 
daughters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has applied to form a women's 
association, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA. It quoted the daily 
Tehran Times as saying that Zahra Mostafavi had asked the Interior Ministry for 
permission to form the Women's Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Mostafavi, 50, a university lecturer in philosophy, has been active in women's 
affairs and was the host of an international conference in Tehran about women 
last year. The Tehran Times predicted that a large number of women would join 
Mostafavi's society once it was formed, the news agency said. However, don't 
expect its members to publicly burn their chadors.

 -- Mary Campbell, a fervent Democrat, was the last person to expect an 
invitation to President-elect Bush's inauguration Jan. 20. But she got one -- 
and she's going. Campbell, a former Democratic member of the Clover, S.C., Town 
Council, got the unsolicited tickets in the mail last month. No one knows for 
sure, but her name may have something to do with the mystery. South Carolina 
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. and Bush, both Republicans, are buddies. Gov. 
Campbell, who will attend the inauguration, asked that his sister Mary be 
invited as well. But the sister, whose married name is Mary Carpenter, didn't 
get the tickets. So the governor called for replacements for her. Tony Denny, 
executive director of the state Republican Party, said he wasn't aware of any 
mix-up but said Mary Campbell is free to keep her tickets. "I don't know her, 
but I hope she has a great time." DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN

A Korean-American businessman was arrested in Newark, N. J., on charges of 
trying to illegally buy and export deadly quarter-ton nerve-gas bombs and an 
array of other weapons, some of which may have been meant for sale to Iran. 
Juwhan Yun, the 48-year-old president of Komex International Corp. in Short 
Hills, N. J., was accused of having negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs 
Service agent to ship bombs containing a lethal gas known as Sarin. Officials 
described Sarin as a colorless, odorless poison that quickly attacks the 
nervous system after being inhaled, absorbed through the skin or swallowed. 
They added that it has not been manufactured in this country since 1970 and 
cannot be exported legally.

BLACK RENTERS MET BIAS, S.D. STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Blacks seeking to rent apartments in seven separate sections of San Diego faced 
some form of discrimination 40% of the time, according to a covert test of the 
housing market presented to the San Diego Housing Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 of 35 locations, black test-renters seeking apartments were treated 
differently from white test-renters who applied for the same apartments on the 
same day, according to the report by the Urban League of San Diego, which 
conducted the test for the Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although housing officials stressed that the test sample was too small to 
generalize the results for the entire city, "the survey served its purpose of 
giving a very good indication that there is discrimination out there," said 
Evan Becker, the Housing Commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wider Testing Needed 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, the Housing Commission's new chairman, called for wider 
testing of the rental market. 
</P>
<P>
The study was part of a larger report by the city's Fair Housing Task Force, 
which also concluded that the city has racially and ethnically segregated 
housing patterns, an imbalance that is partly attributable to low-income 
housing programs enacted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Poor whites are more broadly scattered about the city than poor minority 
groups, and blacks suffer more segregation than Hispanics, who are more 
segregated than Asians, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords and rental agents discriminated most frequently by misrepresenting 
the availability of apartments, the report shows. "White testers were given 
immediate dates and shown several apartments, as opposed to the black testers, 
who were given two weeks to one month for a unit to become available and a 
lesser number of apartments for consideration," the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
At one apartment complex, a white renter was given information on 10 apartments 
and told that one was available immediately. A black renter at the same 
apartment house was given information on only one apartment and told that none 
was available immediately. In all, the study documented 11 cases of 
misrepresented apartment availability. 
</P>
<P>
The report also documented five examples of differing levels of courtesy to 
white and black renters, ranging from "very subtle to being outright rude." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the discrimination counts pertained to more extensive questioning of 
black renters' marital status, and one consisted of a black renter receiving a 
much more detailed description of the difficulty of a required credit check. 
</P>
<P>
"Differential treatment is differential treatment," said Joan Dahlin, senior 
program analyst on the project for the Housing Commission, who said that such 
subtle discrimination has a "chilling effect" on blacks' search for rental 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The survey did not reveal the names of the apartment projects, Dahlin said, 
because its purpose was to gather information rather than to enforce 
anti-discrimination laws. Under amendments to federal fair-housing laws, which 
take effect in March, real violations of statutes could bring fines of as much 
as $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics on fair-housing violations in San Diego kept by the state Department 
of Fair Employment and Housing and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development were unavailable Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
All the violators in the study will be sent follow-up letters and invited to 
participate in fair-housing training sessions, said Elizabeth Morris, assistant 
executive director of the Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Some violations may have been inadvertent, said D. J. Ryan, executive director 
of the San Diego Apartment Assn. and a member of the Fair Housing Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, with a lot of the discrimination, they don't realize that what they 
just did was discriminating," Ryan said. "They have to be informed that, when 
you do this and when you do this, it is discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Projects Throughout City 
</P>
<P>
All the apartment projects surveyed contained more than 20 units. They were in 
the Elliott, Linda Vista, La Jolla, University City, Mira Mesa, Mission Valley, 
Mission Bay, Pacific Beach, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Penasquitos and Loma Portal 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Fair Housing Task Force was formed by the Housing Commission in 
response to a 1986 letter from HUD requiring a more active fair-housing program 
in the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The group found that the number of city census tracts where blacks are more 
than 50% of the population declined from nine in 1970 to seven in 1980. But 
this was because of the addition of members of other minorities rather than 
integration with whites. The white population of those census tracts dropped 
during that decade. 
</P>
<P>
The task force also noted that San Diego has no nonprofit or governmental 
fair-housing organization to assist state and federal enforcement. Los Angeles 
has seven such groups. 
</P>
<P>
The group called for the use of land banking -- a practice under which land is 
purchased and set aside for use as the site of low-income housing -- to help 
develop public housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
It also said the city's commitment to its "balanced community policy," under 
which public housing for the poor is scattered around the city, needs 
strengthening as the cost of land and housing continues to skyrocket.

HOUSING PANEL CENSURES TENANT FOR ANTI-DRUG SIGNS

The San Diego Housing Commission slapped a San Ysidro tenant activist with a 
lease-violation notice when she posted public signs in a campaign against 
neighborhood drug dealers, stirring neighbors' fears of retaliation, according 
to testimony to the Housing Commission Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Byrd-Reis said she posted the signs in her car windows after she found 
her tires slashed Labor Day, in the midst of her yearlong battle against drug 
dealers, drug users, alien smugglers and transients who she said used the 
parking lot of her Alaquinas Drive apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis, who said she and her family had been threatened by dealers because 
of her campaign to drive them from the Vista del Valle project, plastered her 
windshield with banners reading "TIRE WORK: COURTESY OF DRUG DEALER &amp; 
'GANGS', INC." and "DRUG DEALER, WHAT'S NEXT, WHO'S NEXT?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
Three other tenants, fearful that they could be hurt by retaliating dealers, 
complained to the Housing Commission, which operates the complex, said Dana 
Sievert, housing program director. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis was given 24 hours to remove the signs or be given a lease-violation 
notice for endangering the safety of other tenants. On Nov. 4, the sanction was 
made official, eliminating Byrd-Reis' status as a tenant in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the penalty has little practical effect -- Byrd-Reis would have to 
commit three more infractions before facing eviction -- it does prevent 
Byrd-Reis from becoming the apartment block's official representative if it 
forms a tenant council, Sievert said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard," said San Diego Councilman Bob 
Filner, who represents San Ysidro and has worked with Byrd-Reis and Residents 
Organizing to Assist Residents, or ROAR, the tenant group she leads. "If I get 
a parking ticket, I'm not disqualified from being a city councilman. We should 
be working with her, instead of ignoring her." 
</P>
<P>
Filner, who is a housing commissioner, promised to investigate Byrd-Reis' claim 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to express ourselves, the San Diego Housing Commission should allow 
us to do it, whatever form it takes, as long as it's non-libelous, non-profane, 
and doesn't incite a riot," Byrd-Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sievert, who agreed that the project was the site of drug activity, said 
that Housing Commission administrators took action in consideration of other 
tenants' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"As property managers, we need to be concerned with the overall safety of the 
place, and we'd had some calls about that," she said. "The residents were 
concerned that whoever did the first action would come back and retaliate for 
the sign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Beyond Activism' 
</P>
<P>
"It goes beyond activism that is totally constructive," said Evan Becker, the 
Housing Commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The commission fulfilled Byrd-Reis and fellow tenants' most urgent request 
Thursday, when it approved a contract to hire security guards for Vista del 
Valle and two other apartment complexes it manages. 
</P>
<P>
Three security guards will patrol Byrd-Reis' parking lot from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
on a trial basis beginning Feb. 1, Sievert said. The move is a significant 
policy shift for the Housing Commission, which had been wary of the expense, 
potential liability and precedent of getting into the security business, Becker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protection Needed 
</P>
<P>
But Byrd-Reis and some other tenants believe that security guards are the only 
way to permanently rid the complex of dealers. Although police have been 
responsive to calls, even Byrd-Reis has refused to testify in court because of 
fear of retaliation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Commission has secured doors and windows, improved outside lighting 
and added landscaping in an effort to deter drug activity, but failed, she 
said. Byrd-Reis said she has taken photos of drug dealers and confronted 
transients to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"That type of activity is like cockroaches," she said. "You bring the light and 
they disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd-Reis said she plans to appeal the lease-violation notice.

PORT TAKES ON CENTER ISSUE AS MANY STILL PROTEST NAMING IT FOR DR. KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The furor over whether to rename the new bay-front convention center for the 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. moved to the San Diego Unified Port District on 
Thursday, and a majority of port commissioners said they were inundated by mail 
and telephone calls from residents opposed to the change. 
</P>
<P>
Although the City Council voted Tuesday to rename the San Diego Convention 
Center for the slain civil rights leader, the Port District, which is building 
the $160-million center, has final say on naming it. No date has been set for a 
vote, but Port District Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer said the controversial issue 
could come before the board sometime in February. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the issue is now in Port District hands, City Council 
members said Thursday that they continued to receive public input two days 
after their vote to adopt the name San Diego Martin Luther King Convention 
Center. Public opinion ran strongly against naming the center after King, as it 
had before the vote was taken, most of the council members said. However, Wes 
Pratt, the only black member of the council and a leader of the drive to honor 
King, said calls to his office favored the decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initiative in the Works 
</P>
<P>
In another development Thursday, at least one San Diego resident was working to 
mount an initiative to overturn the council action and keep the current name of 
the center. Robert L. Pruett, a retired businessman, said he does not intend to 
wait until the port commissioners vote before beginning to collect signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Port District attorney Joe Patello said that, although commissioners are not 
elected officials, the public does have the right to overturn their actions 
through the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the Port District board are appointed by the councils of 
the five cities that have bay-front property: San Diego (which has three 
representatives on the board), Chula Vista, National City, Coronado and 
Imperial Beach (which have one each). A ballot initiative to overturn a Port 
District decision would have to go before voters in all five cities, Patello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, three port commissioners have publicly stated that they are leaning 
toward backing the decision to name the convention center after Dr. King, and 
two have said they are opposed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm appointed by the City Council, and I certainly listen mightily to what 
they want," Wolfsheimer said. "This is a building that they're going to be 
leasing from us for 25 years. They should be able to name it what they want to 
name it." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer also said, however, that he received about 100 phone calls Thursday 
from the public, and all but one of the callers opposed the name change. 
</P>
<P>
"We still ought to look into this a little bit before we vote . . . hear the 
pros and cons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners polled Thursday said they, too, had received a surprisingly 
heavy outpouring of opinion on the issue, most of it against renaming the 
facility for Dr. King. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They're the Tenant' 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Daniel Larsen, who also represents San Diego, said that, although 
he has heard opposition to changing the center's name, he would also lean 
toward following the council's wishes. "Even though we own the building, 
they're the tenant, and it's up to them what they want to name the building," 
Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Burk of Coronado is the sole commissioner who has said he will vote 
against naming the center for King. Although Burk was ill and unable to comment 
Thursday, his wife, Ramona, said a large number of phone calls have come to 
their home in support of Burk's position. 
</P>
<P>
National City representative Delton Reopelle said he wants to do more research, 
but is leaning toward objecting to the name change. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Milford Portwood of Imperial Beach remained undecided, repeating 
his previously stated opinion that he needs more information before coming to a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The only mail I've received was against renaming it, and it was mostly from 
hotel owners and from the convention center community, saying that it's real 
important that the name identifies the location of the convention center," 
Portwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Robert Penner of Chula Vista is also undecided. "I'm going to 
listen to all the arguments all the way up to the last moment, and then I'll 
make up my mind," Penner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting to See Split 
</P>
<P>
Penner had previously said that his decision would be influenced by the council 
split on the issue. He said Thursday that the 7-2 vote approving the name 
change "tells me that the great majority of people on the council would like 
it, but there is still a minority opinion. It's not a straight and absolute 
100% mandate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end analysis, it is not the paramount issue for this city. There are 
other issues that should command our attention. Whatever way we vote, the 
convention center will still be a nice thing for San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner William Rick, who represents San Diego, was unavailable for 
comment Thursday, but has said he would support the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett, a three-year resident of San Diego who has maintained a boat in the 
area for 25 years, said he started work on the initiative before dawn Thursday. 
His newly formed committee, Citizens to Keep the Name "San Diego Convention 
Center," has already drawn some support, he said. He declined to name the 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett said he opposes "the City Council's blatant disregard for the 
community," and denied that racism is involved. "It is an issue about the name 
of the convention center, period." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy developed last May over the name of the center -- under 
construction on West Harbor Drive and scheduled to open in September -- when a 
citizens advisory board recommended using it to honor Dr. King, who was 
assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 council decision to change the name of Market Street to Martin Luther 
King Way was overturned by voters in November, 1987, after a bitter campaign by 
Market Street merchants opposed to the change. In response, the council 
appointed an advisory board of community and business leaders to find an 
appropriate tribute.

4 MAIN FIGURES CHARGED IN PORT DISTRICT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four alleged masterminds behind a purchasing scam that authorities say 
cheated the San Diego Unified Port District out of at least $700,000 were 
charged Thursday with multiple felony charges of fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
The men allegedly used the money to pay for a variety of private merchandise 
such as auto repairs, televisions, stereos and computers. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against the men, two of whom worked in the Port District's 
purchasing department -- including its former director -- and two others who 
worked for the Genuine Parts/Napa auto parts store, are the result of an 
18-month investigation. The district attorney's office says the probe is 
continuing and could involve about 20 more people. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's charges follow by two months a complaint lodged against a former 
Harbor Police lieutenant who authorities say benefited from the scam by 
receiving $16,045 in goods, services and materials -- such as repairs to his 
truck and the construction of a patio and fence at his Ramona home -- that were 
billed and paid for by the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Guilty Plea 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the former policeman, William Clair, who was described by 
authorities as being on the periphery of the scandal, pleaded guilty to one 
count of felony grand theft as part of a plea agreement with the district 
attorney's office. Clair, who is to be sentenced on Feb. 28, faces up to a year 
in County Jail and a maximum fine of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony D. Samson, chief of the district attorney's fraud unit, said the four 
men charged Thursday were "the ones who caused it to happen . . . the core 
group" that both initiated and conducted the scam at least from Jan. 12, 1986, 
to July, 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The four men, who will be arraigned Feb. 2, were identified as: Richard Miles 
Cersosimo, 48, former director of the purchasing department; Rudi Michael 
Enriques, 37, a meter repairman in the Port District's purchasing department; 
Paul Robert Manes, 48, who was manager of the auto parts store on 12th Avenue, 
and Arnoldo Olivarria Castillo, 54, the sales agent who handled the Port 
District's account for the auto parts store. 
</P>
<P>
An arraignment had been scheduled for Thursday morning, but only Manes and 
Castillo appeared before Municipal Judge Charles L. Patrick, who granted a 
postponement. Enriques' attorney said he was on his way to the courthouse, and 
the lawyer for Castillo said his client was on vacation in Mexico and is 
expected to return next week. 
</P>
<P>
According to Samson, all the defendants knew they were the focus of the 
investigation, and both Enriques and Manes were publicly named as taking part 
in the alleged conspiracy when Clair was charged in November. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined in documents, Enriques faces 21 felony counts and a maximum 10 
years in prison; Cersosimo faces 11 counts and about 8 years in jail, and Manes 
and Castillo each face 9 counts and 8 years in prison. The felony counts range 
from grand theft and appropriation of public monies for personal use to 
falsification of accounts and conspiracy to defraud another of property. 
</P>
<P>
Enriques and Cersosimo both resigned from the Port District, and Manes and 
Castillo have been suspended without pay, said Roy Hedges, general manager for 
the Napa Distribution Center of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Samson said the four men worked as a team to steal from the Port District. The 
men allegedly used a blizzard of phony and altered business documents, such as 
invoices and requisition forms, to cover up illegal purchases that were paid 
for by Port District funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District paid for items it never received, and the bogus charges made 
by the auto parts store contained a 67% markup, Samson said. He noted that the 
markup not only provided the store with profit but also helped Manes and 
Castillo individually because both were paid a commission. The prosecutor said 
that Napa Auto Parts is not under suspicion and that company executives have 
cooperated with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the scandal was that, although individual purchases may have cost 
several thousand dollars each, they were "laundered" through the Port 
District's purchasing system by way of a series of low-cost invoices, each of 
which were kept below $250, thus allowing them to be routinely paid without 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Port District officials say they have instituted changes in the purchasing 
system to prevent a recurrence of the scam. 
</P>
<P>
A new aspect of the fraud revealed Thursday accuses the four of also engaging 
in a bid-rigging scheme. According to the complaint, Cersosimo allegedly 
solicited official bids for equipment, which Castillo signed for Napa Auto 
Parts offering prices below or near the cost at which Napa would obtain the 
items on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
Cersosimo, according to the charges, would then declare Napa the low bidder. 
Manes allegedly would then bill the Port District at the price the auto store 
officially submitted. But then, the complaint charges, Manes would have Napa 
bill the Port District separately for any difference between Napa's bid price 
and any higher cost Napa paid in the marketplace for the items, plus a 67% 
markup over and above Napa's actual cost. 
</P>
<P>
Samson said the investigation has taken so long because of the lengthy paper 
trail and altered documents the district attorney's office has had to analyze. 
He estimated that his office has pored over 48,000 documents and interviewed 
more than 140 people. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he believes the scandal may have cost the Port District $1.5 million, 
though his office has so far been able to identify only about $700,000.

SLUMLORD FINED, GETS 45-DAY JAIL SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted slumlord was given $18,700 in fines Thursday and ordered to begin 
serving a 45-day County Jail term next month. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Burkhalter, 56, of Los Angeles was also placed on three years' 
informal probation by Municipal Judge Suzanne Person and was ordered to perform 
1,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhalter was convicted in February, 1987, of violating fire, building and 
safety and health codes at a four-story, 63-unit apartment building he owned at 
1723 W. 9th St. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhalter, who no longer owns the building, was originally sentenced last 
March. He appealed the sentence, contending it was excessive. The Los Angeles 
Superior Court rejected the appeal in November.

REINER WARNS ABOUT ROOFING RIP-OFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner warned Thursday that the recent rainfall and the winter 
season will probably result in an increase in roofing repair scams. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner issued his warning in the wake of the arrest earlier this week of Al Tom 
Nelson, 36, of Temple City, for allegedly bilking a Monrovia man out of $700 by 
spraying commercial roofing tar diluted with gasoline on the man's roof. 
</P>

REWARD FUND SET UP IN CABBIE'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization of officers from 22 Southern California police departments have 
set up a reward fund in an effort to find whoever robbed and killed a cab 
driver after he picked up two fares at Los Angeles International Airport last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Sgt. Don Jackson, president of Law Enforcement Officers for 
Justice, said members of the group raised $1,000 among themselves for the fund. 
He said they are also accepting donations for a separate fund to be turned over 
to the family of 31-year-old Ami Fhima, whose body was found in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"We think both issues are pretty important," Jackson said. He said he and Los 
Angeles Police Officer Garland Hardeman, executive secretary of the 
organization, decided to launch the reward drive because "we were pretty much 
shocked and appalled and wanted to do something. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Both officers are residents of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Law Enforcement Officers for Justice was organized to fight racial 
discrimination in police departments. Jackson said it wants to set an example 
for the community in helping police solve brutal crimes. 
</P>
<P>
He said donations for the reward and assistance funds can be sent to P. O. Box 
225, 1617 Lincoln Blvd., Venice, 90201. Reward donations should be made out to 
LEOJ, while donations to the family should be made out to the Judy Fhima Fund, 
Jackson said.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: WHAT'S IN A NEW NAME? GOOD FRENCH BISTRO FOOD AT 
AN AFFORDABLE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directory assistance operators may grow frustrated when callers request the 
number of "that new French place at 4th and Ivy," but we may be able to glean 
some encouragement from the fact that the management of a new bistro has chosen 
to give it an outlandish, difficult to remember name. 
</P>
<P>
The little-noticed Cafe des Beaux Arts has changed hands and been rechristened 
The French Side of the West. The name doesn't have the same ring as something 
brief and punchy like Chez Jacques or La Grenouille, but it does signify 
something wonderful: The management is so thoroughly unacquainted with American 
restaurant procedures that it actually serves meals the French way -- with 
simplicity but also with an endearing attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
From one point of view, the most important fact about the French Side is that 
it serves four-course dinners at a fixed price of $12.50 and the cooking 
happens to be quite good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chef is From Burgundy 
</P>
<P>
The chef, Guy Naltet, is from Burgundy, one of the two best-known wine 
producing areas of France and a region celebrated for its robust fare. The menu 
draws on the traditions of this region by featuring such pleasant and currently 
hard-to-find dishes as coq au vin, boeuf bourguignonne, poulet chasseur and 
salmon in the special, creamy butter sauce called beurre blanc. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Philippe Beltran is a Parisian who came to San Diego by way of the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
A generously sized plate of charcuterie (the English, and not quite 
satisfactory equivalent of this term would be cold cuts) appears while guests 
study the chalkboard menu. This plate of highly seasoned meat preparations is 
like the overture to an opera -- it forcefully foreshadows that which will 
follow. Besides a slice of rather typical, country-style pate (in this case an 
unexceptional, semi-roughly textured loaf of veal, chicken and duck) the plate 
includes the excellent, seductively garlicky sausage of Lyon; jambon persilee, 
or ham cubes embedded in parsleyed aspic; rillettes, a very rich paste of 
crushed pork, simmered so long that it acquires the smoothness of butter, and a 
slice of Brie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Taste of Sorrel 
</P>
<P>
Chef Naltet does not always emphasize strong flavors. Meals include the choice 
of the soup of the day or a pretty, but rather bland, house salad. The greens 
of the latter are accented here and there with tiny mounds of minced, pickled 
red cabbage and shredded carrots, but the dressing, which a server said 
included mustard, garlic, shallots, herbs and vinegar, tasted almost 
exclusively of oil. It made a disappointing interlude between charcuterie and 
main course. 
</P>
<P>
There was a similar lack of punch in the rouille (a red pepper-based 
mayonnaise) that dressed a classy soupe de poissons, a Mediterranean knock-out 
brewed from fish, tomatoes and herbs that has a deep, briny taste. The purpose 
of the rouille is to make the flavor sparkle; fortunately, this soup was so 
good that it could do without the accent. 
</P>
<P>
A creamy germiny, or sorrel soup, went in quite the opposite direction and 
included a noticeable jolt of lemon juice. Sorrel, a multipurpose green that 
can double as an herb (it is exquisite, and is beginning to turn up in 
supermarket produce sections), has a sourish, lemony flavor of its own, and 
adding lemon to it seems rather beside the point. Nonetheless, the ploy worked 
-- this was a fine, hearty soup. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrel sauce (basically a condensed version of sorrel soup) makes an excellent 
accompaniment to most fish, and the French Side offers it as one of three 
sauces with a beautifully cooked slice of sea bass. The sorrel sauce was tart, 
the pepper sauce assertive and the beurre blanc mild and soothing. The main 
attraction, meanwhile, seemed unusually well done; sea bass can be a coarse, 
unlovable fish, but the kitchen cut the bass more thinly than is common, which 
made it tender and quite agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list runs usually to just eight items, including a grilled trout 
with fennel and a house special (served for two or more guests) of shark with 
saffron sauce and fresh noodles. Meat dishes are typical of Burgundy and 
include a steak in white peppercorn sauce, steak with Roquefort sauce, chicken 
in a pungent mushroom sauce and a special or two of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The French typically pay great attention to garnishes, as does the French Side, 
and most plates include the creamy, garlic-seasoned potato casserole called 
gratin dauphinoise as well as a selection of well-cooked vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Knack for Sauces 
</P>
<P>
The steak in Roquefort sauce also included quite a few peppercorns in its 
seasoning, which made it seem refined and racy at the same moment. Naltet 
generally knows how to make his sauces, and he also knows how to cook a piece 
of beef; this was not the finest meat available (at $12.50 for the dinner, how 
could it be?), but Naltet turned out a tender, juicy product nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The most typically Burgundian dish, boeuf bourguignonne, was the least 
agreeable of those sampled. A chicken breast chasseur took a much happier turn. 
The dish is the French version of the Italian cacciatore (both words mean 
"hunter-style"), but it is far subtler. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are in the classic French bistro style. The choice runs to 
chocolate mousse, a decent caramel custard and a pyramid of profiterolles, or 
ice cream-stuffed cream puffs doused with a good chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Beltran has put together an extremely brief list of French country wines 
suitable to the menu, and priced just as modestly.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten people were injured -- a 3-year-old girl critically -- when a car was 
struck Thursday as it sat disabled in the divider strip of Interstate 5, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Zapata of Pico Rivera was on a life-support system Thursday night at 
Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she was flown by Life Flight helicopter 
for treatment of severe head injuries, hospital spokesman Mark Morelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred after the girl's mother, Laura Zapata, experienced car 
trouble about 11 a.m. and stopped in the center median just south of Las Pulgas 
Road, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Zapata and a passenger crossed the freeway and were at an emergency call box 
talking with the CHP when they saw a Jeep drift onto the shoulder and strike 
the disabled car, a Honda. The impact knocked the three passengers still in the 
Zapata car -- Kathy Zapata; Olivia Vasquez, age unknown, and Olivia Tobias, age 
unknown -- onto the roadway, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman from Sharp Memorial Hospital said Vasquez was in serious 
condition Thursday night with head injuries. Scripps Memorial Hospital 
spokeswoman Lynn Morra said she could not release the name of victim taken 
there for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Jeep, Sherri Hiskett, 24, of Tustin was flown to Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where she was treated for injuries and released, 
according to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Six other occupants of the Jeep were taken to Tri-City Medical Center in 
Oceanside for treatment of minor to moderate injuries. They were identified as 
Debra White, 24; Daniel White, 4, and Tiffany White, 2, all of Santa Ana, and 
Melinda Hiskett, 7; Malyssa Hiskett, 4, and James Hiskett, 2. 
</P>
<P>
One traffic lane was closed for about 90 minutes, and traffic was backed up 
about 2 miles, the CHP said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Spring Valley man already charged with killing a former Los Angeles Rams 
football player during an attempted robbery in La Mesa was charged Thursday 
with a second murder. 
</P>
<P>
George Ray Cunnington, 27, pleaded not guilty to the new charge of killing 
Robert Hetmer, 51, of Spring Valley several hours before the Nov. 18 slaying of 
Rey Nicholas Phillinganes, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Robinson told the court that his office is considering 
filing special-circumstances allegations, which could lead to the death penalty 
for Cunnington if he is convicted. The grounds for the special circumstances 
would be that multiple victims were killed and that the Phillinganes slaying 
occurred during an attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick ordered bail to remain at $1 million. 
A preliminary hearing was set for March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Cunnington had lived with Hetmer for several weeks before the 
shooting. He said the house was ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
Phillinganes was in his car when a gunman approached him, tapped on the window 
with the gun and then shot him in the chest.

A man who jumped bail in U. S. District Court in San Diego while awaiting 
sentencing on charges of conspiracy to commit murder has been placed on the U. 
S. Marshal Service's 15-most-wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Thomas Innie, 38, was charged with conspiring to murder Oklahoma 
businessman Robert Lincoln Barr. Barr was shot in August, 1985, but survived.

RAIDERS HAVEN'T PAID '88 RENT, COLISEUM CHARGES IN NEW SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission sued its professional football 
tenant, the Los Angeles Raiders, again Thursday, this time claiming that the 
team has failed to pay its rent for games played in the stadium during the 1988 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The commission more than a year ago filed a breach-of-contract suit for at 
least $57 million against the team in connection with its announced plan to 
move to suburban Irwindale. But pending construction of a stadium there, the 
team has continued to play its games in the Coliseum under a lease that does 
not expire until the end of the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
According to terms of the Coliseum lease, the Raiders are supposed to pay 8% of 
a home game's admission receipts within 10 days of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Thursday, the 
team has not paid anything to the stadium under the clause for either the 
exhibition games or the regular season games. The amount in arrears is now 
estimated at about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Commission attorney Frank Kaplan said Thursday night that he did not wish to 
discuss the latest suit further. He said the commission was reluctant to 
undertake it. 
</P>
<P>
The only Raiders representative who could be reached for comment said he knew 
nothing about the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges: 
</P>
<P>
"Despite repeated demands, the Raiders have failed and refused to pay the 
Coliseum Commission any of the rentals due it for preseason and regular season 
games played by the Raiders in the Coliseum in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that the lease has been breached and that the team, 
therefore, is barred from renewing its lease, according to a clause that 
allowed three five-year options extending to the year 2006, after the 10-year 
regular term expires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders owner Al Davis has frequently expressed great bitterness toward the 
Coliseum Commission, which he charges reneged on a deal to renovate the stadium 
at the same time the Raiders were to construct luxury boxes on the rim of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Commission attorneys have obtained a Superior Court ruling that there was no 
such legally binding deal, but on Aug. 20, 1987, even before that ruling, Davis 
announced plans to move to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
The Irwindale deal, however, has been stymied for more than 15 months by a 
court order holding up arrangements for building the stadium and for a final 
contract between Irwindale and the Raiders until an environmental impact report 
on the project is found acceptable by the court. 
</P>
<P>
The report was formally certified Thursday night by the Irwindale City Council 
and an attorney for the city said an attempt will be made to get the court 
order lifted by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were involved in rent disputes with Oakland authorities before the 
team moved to Los Angeles in 1982.

DARYL GATES' COURT FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I reflect back on the past year, it seems that 1988 may be remembered for 
the violence that accompanied it. The gang violence that continues to plague 
Los Angeles County stands out most, probably because it is so close to home. 
One of the tragic offshoots of this gang violence is the miscarriage of justice 
in the decision of Larez vs. Gates and select officers of the LAPD. I have 
spent almost 20 years working in the criminal justice system. I have seen some 
perverse decisions but this one is certainly among the worst. 
</P>
<P>
I am familiar with the rigorous procedures of law governing the issuance of a 
warrant. These officers developed and presented evidence before a judge that 
this family, a family with gang associations, had possession of a gun that was 
used in a gang murder. A warrant was issued by the judge who reviewed the facts 
and evidence of this case. This search warrant was served by uniformed 
officers. Consistent with the disrespect of legitimate authority and the enmity 
which "gang" families have for law enforcement, Jessie Larez attacked the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this unprovoked attack, the officers exercised a reasonable and 
prudent amount of force to overcome the resistance. There were neither 
extensive nor multiple injuries inflicted on anyone that would have been 
consistent with excessive force. It was unfortunate that Larez received a 
broken nose, however, this is one of the possible consequences of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
What is unfortunate in this instance are the actions of Judge Robert Takasugi 
and this jury. Takasugi should have had the courage to recognize this suit as 
the frivolous action it was and to treat it as such, but this is a stand few 
judges have the courage to take. Jury members in the sterile environment of 
their chamber exercised a self-righteous pomposity not uncommon to take a slap 
at established authority. 
</P>
<P>
The message this judge and jury has sent out to the men and women in law 
enforcement is this: It is not enough that you put your life on the line for us 
daily. Your financial security and that of your families is now on the line 
too. It doesn't matter how rigorously you adhere to the law and to department 
procedures. If you offend some suspect, be prepared to lose everything you 
have. Neither does the First Amendment to the Constitution apply to you people 
in law enforcement. You are not entitled to voice personal opinions or 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this judge and jury may feel good about themselves. They have taken a 
significant step forward to take some of the risk out of gang activity and to 
promote future gang violence in our communities.

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm calling my lawyer to see whether it is possible to sue the City Council of 
Los Angeles for deciding -- in closed session, yet -- not only to pay Gates' 
$170,000 personal damage obligation but to appeal the judgment on his behalf at 
the expense of the residents of the city. The City Council believes that the 
chief's acts were within the scope of his city-paid duties and thus the 
citizens should pay for his foibles. 
</P>
<P>
But all this time and money could have been saved if only Gates, his minions 
and others who are likely to exceed the bounds of decency through 
overzealousness or prejudice would be required to buy, at their expense as part 
of their jobs, insurance to cover the cost of their defense as well as any 
damage awards against them. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would this requirement bring us a better caliber of public servant to 
begin with, but when those who water at the public trough realize that they 
must pay the cost of this coverage and that if they're not good citizens they 
may become uninsurable and/or they may cause the cost of coverage to escalate, 
the abuses will grind to a halt and the good citizens will not have to suffer 
any more than the cost of their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attorney Stephen Yagman should be accorded the blessings of every 
citizen for insisting that the people of the city should not have to pay for 
the acts of an employee who does not do what he was hired to do. We've been 
punished enough in having Gates in office.

<P>
A jury has recently held Gates liable for damages for the acts of his officers. 
Now, lawyers for relatives of two murdered jail inmates are talking of holding 
Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates personally liable. They cite the Indian 
government's action in charging Union Carbide officials in the United States 
with manslaughter in the Bhopal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
These events, together with the growing number of policemen killed in line of 
duty, should dampen the enthusiasm of able individuals to serve the people of 
California in these complex and dangerous jobs. It is as important to protect 
the police from the bullets and attacks of the public as it is to protect the 
public from excess use of police force in risky or provocative situations or 
occasional clear instances of brutality. If police heads did not support their 
officers, there would soon be no police to face the Russian roulette of gangs, 
drugs, domestic violence and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
While enthusiasm for police work may diminish, enthusiasm for the practice of 
law should increase. Just when it seemed there were too many lawyers, a whole 
new field of lucrative lawsuits is opening up, as liability is extended from 
institutions to persons in ever-widening circles. How far do we go in holding 
individuals responsible for failures in their systems? 
</P>
<P>
Shall we hold the heads of corporations legally liable for the acts of their 
employees? Generals for the misconduct of their soldiers? The President of the 
United States for the acts of his subordinates? 
</P>
<P>
Holding people responsible for the behavior of others, barring conspiracy, is 
unjust and an ominous precedent. It could negatively affect all our 
institutions, which are already overburdened with problems.

WATKINS TO THE RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in two years, Adm. James D. Watkins has been called out of 
retirement because he seemed just right for a job that might not even be 
humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
The perception was right the first time. As the chairman of President Reagan's 
commission on AIDS, plunging into an area of which he knew nothing, he stitched 
together a national policy for slowing the growth of the deadly virus until a 
cure could be found. Now President-elect George Bush has asked him to become 
secretary of energy and rescue the nation's nuclear-weapons industry from a 
calamity that government and industry have been busy creating for four decades. 
Surely the perception is right again. Better yet, this time Watkins, a nuclear 
engineer, has a running start. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that a massive assembly line of government plants woven through 
a dozen states, each plant adding its share to the fabrication of a nuclear 
warhead, has simply collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The land and streams around some of the plants are toxic wastelands; some of 
the plants that date from the dawn of the nuclear age are in such disrepair 
that they can no longer contribute to the process without risking the lives not 
only of workers but also of residents of their regions. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation start at around $80 billion 
and go as high as $200 billion -- not much less than what it cost the U.S. 
government, in constant dollars, to build the complex in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The process of cleaning up toxic wastes around plants on the assembly line may 
take 20 years. Whether some of the plants can be brought back to life must be 
settled far faster than that, particularly those at Savannah River, Ga., and 
Hanford, Wash., where the elements that give nuclear warheads their punch -- 
plutonium and tritium -- are created inside nuclear reactors. All nine of 
Hanford's reactors are out of commission. All five reactors at Savannah River 
are dormant, two of them permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Plutonium was manufactured at those two sites by bombarding enriched uranium 
with neutrons. Tritium results from bombarding lithium with neutrons. The basic 
explosive power in a nuclear warhead comes from plutonium. Tritium makes the 
bang bigger. Plutonium does not decay. Tritium does. 
</P>
<P>
By some calculations the Defense Department will have to start transferring 
tritium from one warhead to another to keep some of its nuclear weapons alive 
as early as this autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the deadline is real is one of many things that Watkins will have to 
decide for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has every reason to hope that in Watkins he has a Cabinet officer who can 
make that decision and also puzzle out other questions about the most serious 
environmental and budgetary problems on the next President's list. One good 
reason for that hope is the way another Navy man, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, evaluated Watkins' performance on the 
AIDS commission: 
</P>
<P>
"It was vintage Jim Watkins," he said. "He learned everything he could about 
it, analyzed it, then divided it up into manageable areas. It's just the kind 
of thing he does so well." On his new assignment, it is exactly the sort of 
thing that he will need to do so well.

MUST ROUTE TO TOP JOBS BE BOYCOTT?

the California Council of Urban Leagues. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the assassination of American's foremost civil-rights leader more than 20 
years ago, the self-congratulatory equal-opportunity placards displayed by 
corporations have become commonplace and, by most accounts, much more 
prominent. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Martin Luther King Day is an appropriate time to state frankly what 
most minorities want and that apparently most corporations do not yet 
understand. Minorities want contracts, not contacts. Minorities want to occupy 
corporate suites, not corporate basements. 
</P>
<P>
The most powerful and prestigious quasi-public corporation in Southern 
California, SoCal Edison, is an illustration, but by no means a unique example, 
of the hollowness of the progress that has been made since King's death or 
since Rosa Parks refused to sit at the back of that Montgomery, Ala., bus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Parks asserted her basic rights. At that time, Edison had no blacks in 
any key or leadership positions. Thirteen years later, when King was killed, 
Edison still had no blacks in key management positions. Today this $15-billion 
publicly held and well-respected corporation still has no blacks in any 
leadership positions. None of Edison's top 100 employees are black. Only one of 
its 275 employees earning more than $75,000 is black, according to recent 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are not the only minority that has been ignored. Despite the presence of 
6.5 million Latinos in California, only two of Edison's top 275 employees are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Although Edison's "segregated" management practices appear to be the worst 
among major California utilities, it is not unique in corporate America. For 
example, only one of the top 10 California-based defense contractors has a 
black on its board of directors. Not one of the top 10 defense contractors has 
a Latino or Asian director. 
</P>
<P>
Exclusion from management opportunities, 34 years after the U.S. Supreme Court 
ordered desegregation of all public schools, is only part of the exclusionary 
pattern. On the average, major California utilities awarded less than one-half 
of 1% of their $5 billion in outside contracts to black businesses last year. 
(Southern California Gas Co. was the only significant exception.) 
</P>
<P>
Defense contractors, despite receiving more than $155 billion in federal 
contracts in 1987, have a similarly poor record. The typical major contractor 
provides less than one-half of 1% of contracts to blacks, and even this trivial 
figure is often inflated by the use of minority fronts controlled by white 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
Although corporations are often praised for their philanthropy, most 
concentrate their contributions on the mainstream arts or on safe, non-minority 
civic organizations. For example, according to data recently filed with the 
California Public Utilities Commission, SoCal Edison contributed only $43,500 
to Latino organizations in 1987, and about the same amount to black 
organizations. This occurred despite the fact that Edison earned almost $700 
million in net profits that year. 
</P>
<P>
I have thought about what King might have said and done under these 
circumstances. Consistent with his commitment to nonviolence, King might well 
have considered an economic boycott, like the one that brought Montgomery, 
Ala., to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
Today the minority community has numerous economic weapons at its disposal. We 
can ask the Public Utilities Commission to block all utility mergers that 
violate the public interest, including the pending Edison merger with San Diego 
Gas &amp; Electric. We can also seek to block rate increases until utility 
policies reflect the needs and composition of our integrated society. 
</P>
<P>
We can ask Congress to award defense contracts based in part on a company's 
affirmative-action record (including employment, management, business 
opportunities and philanthropic contributions to minorities), in order to give 
a competitive advantage to those with good records. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these considerations are no longer just dreams. Minorities have 
recently filed a legal petition with the Public Utilities Commission and with 
Congress to help create a modern-day analogue of Martin Luther King's economic 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
I was a teen-ager when Rosa Parks stood firm, and I never doubted. I still 
don't.

BLAIR IS NAMED INTERIM MANAGER FOR ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Blair, San Diego city manager until he retired in 1985, will run the city 
of Escondido until a permanent city manager is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Blair replaces Vern Hazen, who resigned last week under pressure from the 
slow-growth majority on the Escondido City Council. Blair was chosen after a 
council executive session Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido will pay Blair $5,000 a month as interim manager, and he will start 
work this weekend, attending a workshop on growth management in Laguna Beach 
with council members Carla DeDominicis and Jerry Harmon, and top Escondido 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
Blair, 63, operates a private management consulting firm in San Diego. He 
served as San Diego city manager from 1978 until his retirement and had been a 
deputy city manager and assistant city manager in San Diego since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen will remain as a consultant with the city of Escondido, drawing his 
$95,000-a-year salary, until his employment contract ends in August. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Mayor Doris Thurston said that Blair will not be a candidate for the 
permanent city manager's post. The council plans to hire an executive-search 
firm to conduct a nationwide search for the city's next permanent city 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Blair said he has been offered other chances to serve as interim city manager 
but has turned them down. He said he called Escondido officials to apply for 
the post when he heard of the vacancy.

JOSE ANTONIO MACHADO WOULD BE PLEASED; 
</P>
<P>
OLD NAME PROPOSED FOR HARBOR LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was nothing more than a twist of fate that led Jose Antonio Machado, a 
Mexican wagon team driver, to marry the widow of his boss, land baron Jose 
Dolores Sepulveda, in 1825. 
</P>
<P>
Sepulveda had been killed by Indians on a trip from Monterey to his hacienda on 
the shore of what is now Harbor Lake in Harbor City. Historians suspect that 
the subsequent union of Machado and Sepulveda's widow came about so she would 
have a husband to protect the Sepulveda family's claim to the land and the 
lake, which later bore Machado's name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Change Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Machado did just that. And now, 128 years after his death, he is about to be 
honored for it. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks commissioners will 
consider a proposal to switch the name of Harbor Lake back to Machado Lake. The 
proposal is likely to pass without opposition, according to city officials. The 
park around the lake -- Harbor Regional Park -- will retain its name. 
</P>
<P>
The park is bounded roughly by Pacific Coast Highway, Vermont and Normandie 
avenues, Anaheim Street and the Harbor Freeway. The 45-acre lake curves like 
the letter C on the west side of the park. The city of Los Angeles purchased 
the lake and the park in the 1950s and named the lake Harbor Lake in 1971, when 
the park was dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
The name change was proposed about a year ago by Ken Malloy, a San Pedro 
environmentalist who is so involved with the park that he has been dubbed its 
unofficial supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw no reason why we shouldn't retain the old name, which is so necessary in 
these times when things are changing so and we're just plowing under our 
history," Malloy said. "The lake area has been pretty much passed by in 
recorded history." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has also generated support among community leaders in Harbor City, 
according to Niki Tennant, deputy to Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who 
represents the area. Tennant said the members of the Harbor Community 
Coordinating Council, as well as the Flores' Citizens Advisory Council, have 
endorsed the name change. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the staff at the Department of Recreation and Parks has given its 
approval to the plan, and park Supervisor Roger Williams said he intends to 
request that the 231-acre park, which includes a golf course and camping 
grounds, be declared a historic site by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The Machado Rancho years and years ago sat up on top of where the golf course 
is, right over there across the lake," Williams said. "The campground back in 
that area was the site of an old Indian reservation." 
</P>
<P>
According to Recreation and Parks Department literature, Harbor Regional Park 
was originally the site of two of the largest Indian villages in Southern 
California. The Sepulveda family moved onto the land in the 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
The lake apparently was named for Machado after he moved onto the property in 
the 1800s, and it was called Machado Lake for about a century, Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incorrect Name? 
</P>
<P>
During the 1940s, '50s and '60s, the lake was also known as Bixby Slough, after 
two brothers who eventually bought the land. But Malloy said that name was 
incorrect -- Bixby Slough referred to a body of water farther north. 
</P>
<P>
But Rudecinda LoBuglio, who is a descendant of the Machados and Sepulvedas, 
said, "We always called it Machado Lake, regardless of whether they called it 
Bixby Slough or some other slough or Harbor Lake." 
</P>
<P>
LoBuglio, a former San Pedro resident who lives in Janesville, Calif., said her 
grandmother was born near Machado Lake in 1883. She said she would like to see 
the lake called by its original name. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of Machado descendants in the Wilmington area and the San 
Pedro area," she said, "and I think they will all be delighted."

AFFIDAVIT CLAIMS PRINCIPAL'S USE OF SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former principal of Hillcrest High School in Inglewood set up an 
unauthorized bank account to divert at least $4,000 in school funds for his 
personal use, according to a sworn statement filed in court by a police 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Matthews, who has not been charged while the investigation continues, 
spent the money on clothes, groceries, cosmetics and a $218 Nativity scene that 
was ordered for the school but sent to his home, according to the affidavit and 
other police records filed Dec. 7 in Inglewood Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews has declined comment and his attorney, Johnnie L. Cochran, could not 
be reached. Matthews, who has worked on the election campaigns of several 
school board members and other Inglewood political figures, was suspended a 
year ago, but has remained on the district payroll. In the spring he was 
reassigned to a central office administrative post, and in October board 
members voted to initiate dismissal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still on Salary 
</P>
<P>
Those proceedings have not been completed, however, and Matthews continues to 
work for the district and draw an annual salary of about $60,000, according to 
board President Caroline Coleman, who cast the lone vote against his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' removal as principal came after a finance administrator learned of 
the existence of the unauthorized account and Inglewood police began an 
investigation. The police inquiry was slowed by a five-month delay in obtaining 
bank records, according to a sworn statement by Inglewood Detective Paul 
Harvey, who is in charge of investigating fraud and white-collar crimes. The 
investigation involved an exhaustive review of school and bank records and 
interviews of current and former school employees. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said he could not discuss the matter, but his lengthy affidavit and 
supporting documents outline the case against the former principal. The 
affidavit says that over a 16-month period Matthews deposited more than $10,000 
into the account and withdrew at least $9,600, but some of the money apparently 
was his. The investigator said police have evidence that nearly $4,000 in 
public funds was diverted for Matthews' personal use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Charges 
</P>
<P>
The documents also say investigators will soon present their findings to the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office and ask prosecutors to file 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavits allege that Matthews opened the unauthorized bank account at 
Wells Fargo Bank in Inglewood in August, 1986, in the name "Hillcrest High 
School Clubs/Leonard Matthews." The documents say he used the account to divert 
donations intended for the school, as well as profits from a student store and 
employee paychecks that had been padded with phony overtime claims. 
</P>
<P>
Several employees questioned by investigators said Matthews apparently "padded 
their time cards so their payroll checks would be larger than they should have 
been," Harvey said in the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
"By depositing these padded checks into the clubs account, he was able to write 
employees replacement checks for what they had actually earned. The difference 
between what was paid for by the district and what was earned by the employees 
was apparently kept by Matthews." 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit said at least one of the employees questioned the arrangement but 
followed the principal's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit was filed last month to obtain a warrant that enabled detectives 
to search Matthews' home and his four cars -- a Cadillac, a Mercury, and two 
Mercedes-Benzes, according to the documents. Police seized numerous personal 
and school financial records, as well as parts from an outdoor Nativity scene: 
six 30-inch choirboy figurines, six choir girls, two donkeys, two cows, a camel 
and a 30-inch angel. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers say Matthews ordered those decorations from a North Carolina 
firm, paid for them with $218.28 from the student body account at Hillcrest, 
and had them shipped to his home on 5th Avenue in a pleasant east Inglewood 
neighborhood, which he gave as the address of the school. 
</P>
<P>
According to the court filing, Matthews deposited checks from area businesses 
and individuals into the account although they were intended as donations for 
Hillcrest High School activities such as graduations and banquets. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that bank records show that Matthews also used the account to profit 
from a school awards dinner held at an Inglewood-area hotel in June, 1987. 
Police allege he deposited proceeds from the student store and private 
donations for the banquet into the account, paid for the event with those funds 
and kept the $207 difference, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, the affidavit says, Matthews obtained a $364.50 refund 
check from a store where the school had ordered and paid for file boxes. 
Instead of turning the money over to the district when the order was canceled, 
he deposited it in the account, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that Matthews made a long list of personal purchases with 
embezzled funds, including clothes bought at numerous men's shops and 
department stores, cosmetics, car repairs, and treatment of a pet dog, the 
documents say. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 3-1 board decision in October to initiate dismissal proceedings 
against him, Matthews, a 14-year employee, continued working for the district 
in a truancy program. At the time, the jobs of several higher-ranking 
administrators were eliminated and other jobs and programs were cut to overcome 
a budget deficit of more than $3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal action was one of the first moves by Supt. George McKenna after 
he assumed the post Oct. 1. McKenna could not be reached for comment this week 
on the status of the dismissal proceedings against Matthews, and other 
administrators would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees and community activists, including board member Zyra McCloud, 
have strongly criticized the delay and accused the other board members of 
protecting Matthews because he has supported them politically. 
</P>
<P>
Board members confirmed that Matthews has worked on the campaigns of past and 
current board members, including Coleman and board members Larry Aubry and 
Joseph T. Rouzan. Aubry voted for Matthews' dismissal. Rouzan was elected in 
November, after dismissal proceedings were initiated. 
</P>
<P>
Former board member W. R. (Tony) Draper, a critic of political influence in the 
school district, noted that Matthews was disciplined in 1987 by administrators 
for using district equipment to prepare political literature on behalf of 
candidates supported by Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent. Draper said the fact 
that Matthews continues working more than a year after suspicions of wrongdoing 
surfaced at Hillcrest "makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
"They just reassigned him," Draper said in an interview. "He definitely should 
not be getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
While Coleman acknowledged Matthews' political activism on her behalf, she said 
it had nothing to do with the board's handling of his case or the fact that 
Matthews remains an employee. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wins and we weren't paying him, we'd have to pay him back salary," she 
said. "It's better that he's working, rather than leisurely sitting at home." 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman spoke in Matthews' defense and said it is possible that the board 
will take some action at its next meeting to change or modify the decision to 
fire Matthews, who is scheduled for an administrative hearing Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We might decide to do something different, to alter the process," Coleman 
said. "Basically it would be to let the criminal proceedings go on, rather than 
us trying to be a jury." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said she believes Matthews is innocent but may have "violated some 
school codes." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Aubry also said there has been new discussion among board members 
about modifying the dismissal effort. He did not explain further. 
</P>
<P>
Aubry said his political relationship with Matthews had not affected his 
handling of the case, noting that he voted to fire Matthews. Aubry, who won a 
board seat in a special election in June, said "there may be some merit" to 
complaints that political factors affected the board's handling of the case in 
the first half of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rouzan said he is unaware of any new action on Matthews' case being 
contemplated by board members, though he said school board lawyers are 
negotiating with attorney Cochran in hopes of arriving at a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand they're trying to negotiate restitution," he said. Rouzan also 
claimed that board members have inadequate information because they have not 
had access to police records. If charges against Matthews are verified, Rouzan 
said, "restitution and a demotion of some sort would be the least we could 
accept. He might even consider resignation." 
</P>
<P>
Board members McCloud and Hill-Hale could not be reached for comment.

'SWAMP GAS' ELECTRIC PLANT IS READY TO LOG IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $13.7-million plant at the Palos Verdes Landfill that makes electricity from 
gas given off by decomposing organic material will be dedicated and open for 
tours on Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The plant eventually will earn as much as $7 million a year by harnessing what 
otherwise would be a waste product. It burns methane -- sometimes called "swamp 
gas" -- to produce steam that powers an electrical generator. 
</P>
<P>
The plant produces 11 megawatts of electrical power, which is enough for about 
20,000 homes, according to the county Sanitation Districts. The electricity is 
sold to Southern California Edison Co. The 180-acre landfill, at 25706 
Hawthorne Blvd. in Rolling Hills Estates, has been closed to dumping since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
While the main purpose of the plant is to eliminate the unpleasant odors, the 
sanitation districts said the project also turns a waste product -- normally 
burned off -- into usable energy and eventually will earn between $5 million 
and $7 million a year for landfill maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates will receive 1% of the gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Mitsui &amp; Co. (USA), a Japanese-based construction company, the 
plant will be acquired by the sanitation districts by 1993 under a 
lease-purchase agreement. 
</P>
<P>
John Eppich, assistant head of the districts' Solid Waste Management 
Department, said there will be little profit before then because of operating 
and acquisition expenses. But he estimated that from 1994 to 1998, the profits 
will be between $5 million and $7 million a year. The profits will decrease 
later, upon the expiration of the fixed-price agreement under which Edison has 
agreed to buy electricity. 
</P>
<P>
After 1998, Edison will pay "on the basis of the cheapest power it can buy . . 
. an unknown figure at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The county operates a similar, but larger, gas-to-energy facility at the Puente 
Hills Landfill in Whittier.

No fewer than six expert anglers will make presentations Feb. 4-5 in the 
college auditorium, not on the water. 
</P>
<P>
At the South Bay Adult School in Redondo Beach, the winter catalogue -- in 
addition to hard-core academics such as accounting, basic English and math -- 
offers courses in creating party appetizers, how to wire your house, and coping 
with burnout. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, community colleges and cities spend time and imagination 
coming up with interesting things for people to do weekends and evenings, when 
TV and puttering around the house have paled. 
</P>
<P>
The classes attract anywhere from eight to 40 people and are priced to cover 
hourly instruction costs and other expenses. Fees range from $5 to more than 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to keep a hand in this all the time, finding out what people want by 
trial and error," said Elizabeth Hightower, recreation supervisor at the Rancho 
Palos Verdes Department of Recreation and Parks, which coordinates an extensive 
program of activities from out-of-town excursions to one-day seminars, serving 
all peninsula cities. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are for recreation and you don't take tests," said Mary Lu 
Waddell of the Manhattan Beach Recreation Department, which is about to begin a 
new series of activities. In addition to creative woodworking, there is a new 
attraction, "Whales, Scales and Fish Tails," which will meet at the end of the 
Manhattan Beach Pier and explore undersea life. 
</P>
<P>
"People take these things for fun, to learn to improve the quality of their 
lives," Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more popular kinds of classes, said Hightower, are health and fitness 
courses on race walking, self-defense and Tai Chi Chuan, which relaxes and body 
and helps the mind to concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
Instructor Alan Kan, who describes Tai Chi as "a very natural healing and 
revitalization for mind and body," said he averages 40 students -- from ages 16 
to 70 -- in his beginning, intermediate and advanced courses. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Kan's advanced students are enthusiastic about the relaxation they feel 
and the heightened energy they get from the discipline of Tai Chi. "The feeling 
is nice . . . and if feeling good is addicting, I guess it is," said George 
Deerfield of Rancho Palos Verdes, a physician's assistant in Los Angeles who 
first enrolled in Kan's class six years ago after spotting it in the program 
guide. "I maintain a hectic schedule and it appealed to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hightower said some of the more popular classes are seminars on the stock 
market and estate planning, reflecting the affluence of the peninsula residents 
who take them. 
</P>
<P>
"Computers are a big thing here and (those) classes are usually filled," said 
Rosalie McCarrell, who compiles the South Bay Adult School catalogue. Self-help 
courses and cooking are popular, too. 
</P>
<P>
"People like the course on cooking for two," she said. "We're trying a sushi 
class for the first time, but I don't know how it will come out." 
</P>
<P>
As a gauge of what's hot in Manhattan Beach, Waddell said that several tennis 
classes are already filled and the rush is on for ballroom dancing and 
ceramics. In the summer, she said, beach volleyball will be the A ticket in the 
sports-oriented beach town. 
</P>
<P>
Because the goal is to make classes self-supporting, they must attract enough 
people or face cancellation. To entice registrants, classes are given clever 
names: "The Procrastination Seduction," or how to escape the syndrome of being 
too late or too busy, and "Recovering From Perfectionism" -- getting out of the 
trap of making unrealistic demands on yourself and others. 
</P>
<P>
"Reliable House-Breaking" is about training puppies, not the art of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
The cities and the schools work hard to get the word out. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Adult School, which draws enrollment from El Segundo to the 
peninsula, mails 85,000 brochures. The peninsula program guides are sent to all 
area residents four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many courses are starting now and enrollment is open. While it's best to get in 
at the beginning, people can still join through the early class meetings, 
unless there are skills involved that would make catching up difficult. Even 
late registrants must pay full fees. One activity available in the South Bay 
requires no registration, no classroom, and has no set meeting times. It's 
24-hour automated play and pay racquetball at Marine Avenue Park in Manhattan 
Beach. The cost is $1 for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jim Stecklein, city parks and recreation director, "You'd be surprised how 
many are there at 2 in the morning and as early as 5." GERALD FARIS

RENAISSANCE FAIRE SITE ACTION DELAYED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, citing environmental concerns 
about a proposed development on the former Renaissance Pleasure Faire site in 
Agoura, on Thursday delayed a decision on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, asked that the matter be 
delayed to allow officials more time to review environmentalists' concerns 
about grading, drainage and oak trees. Developer Brian Heller's proposal calls 
for the removal of 122 oaks, and opponents say it would scar the hilly area and 
flood adjacent National Park Service land at Paramount Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors plan to take up the matter again on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal parks agencies have expressed interest in buying the 320-acre 
site for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, but Heller has 
said he does not want to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Heller is asking supervisors to amend the county plan so that he can build 159 
homes on the property. The plan allows 103 houses on the parcel, but the county 
Regional Planning Department has recommended that supervisors approve the 
larger development. 
</P>
<P>
Heller told the supervisors that houses on the property would be more 
marketable if more are built. If 103 are built, they would sell for a "very 
frightening" $2.2 million each, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Ed Edelman questioned the county planners' recommendation for 
159 homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why you can't go with the density as it's allowed now," Edelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Parks officials believe that approval of the larger number of houses would make 
the property too expensive for them to buy for parkland, should Heller change 
his mind and decide to sell or should the county condemn the property. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said a delay will give the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state parks agency, extra time to make an offer to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Pete Schabarum was skeptical of the conservancy's statements 
that it wants to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Why hasn't the conservancy or the Park Service or both proceeded a long time 
ago to undertake the acquisition?" Schabarum said. "That doesn't suggest to me 
any real genuine interest or concern." 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said that his agency is 
"sincere and serious" about buying the property. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy expects to appraise the property by March 1 but not before Feb. 
2, Edmiston said. The conservancy has funds for an offer if the appraised value 
is reasonable, he said.

TRAFFIC OFFICIALS SEEK TO BAN SKATERS FROM SEPULVEDA BASIN BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles traffic officials want to put the brakes on roller skaters and 
skateboarders who use two bridges in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
City transportation officials have concluded that the two bridges, though safe 
for bicyclists and joggers, are unsafe for roller skaters and skateboarders, 
and have urged the City Council to prohibit such use. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the council's Transportation and Traffic Committee recommended 
Thursday that the council give the Department of Transportation authority to 
regulate bicycling, roller-skating and skateboarding when it considers such 
uses to be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The bridges over the Los Angeles River -- one on Balboa Boulevard and the other 
on Burbank Boulevard -- contain metal plates designed to slide as the bridges 
expand and contract because of temperature changes, according to a Department 
of Transportation report to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials were unaware of any serious injuries to roller skaters 
or skateboarders on the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Though barred from riding across the bridge, roller skaters and skateboarders 
can use the sidewalk in the rest of the basin, officials said.

VENTURA FREEWAY RAMPS TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Ventura Freeway on- and off-ramps will be closed this weekend for 
repairs, according to the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
From 9 p.m. Friday to 5:30 a.m. Monday, Caltrans will close the Winnetka Avenue 
eastbound off-ramp and westbound on-ramp, Canoga Avenue westbound off-ramp and 
eastbound on-ramp, and the Topanga Canyon Boulevard westbound on-ramp at 
Burbank Boulevard. The far right lanes of Winnetka and Canoga avenues and 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard near the ramps will also be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans will pave, paint road stripes and replace guardrails on the ramps. 
</P>
<P>
The work is part of the ongoing Ventura Improvement Project, to expand and 
repair the Ventura Freeway from Calabasas to the Hollywood Freeway. Various 
ramps between Tampa Avenue and Valley Circle Boulevard will be closed during 
the next several weekends. 
</P>
<P>

DRIVER WHO HIT TRAIN BLAMES CITY OF TORRANCE FOR LACK OF WARNINGS 
</P>

If the city of Torrance had installed warning lights or gates at a railroad 
crossing in the downtown area, Eda Miller says, she never would have driven her 
car into a train. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Los Angeles resident strained her back and broke several ribs 
when she drove her car into an Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway train 
Dec. 12 on Alaska Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Miller filed a claim with the city, blaming it for her injuries and 
the damage to her car. She has not determined how much she wants in damages, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Shall, the city's risk management technician, said she could not comment 
until the traffic department finishes its investigation. City Manager LeRoy 
Jackson said the state Public Utilities Commission is responsible for 
installing warning lights at railroad crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a quality assurance inspector for a mechanical parts manufacturer in 
the area, said she was on her way to a meeting about noon when she approached 
the railroad tracks on Alaska near Maricopa Street. Miller said the street was 
busy, and she was watching for cars pulling out in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
"I just plain didn't hear it or see it," she said. "The next thing I knew, the 
train was in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she was going 20 to 25 m.p.h. when she hit the slow-moving train, 
which was on a spur serving the industrial area. Her car was pushed to the 
opposite side of the street, nearly 20 feet from the point of impact. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the daylights out of me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that her car was wrecked beyond repair and that her injuries have 
kept her from returning to work since the accident. She said she expects to go 
back next week. 
</P>
<P>
She was cited for failure to yield the right of way, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Cohen, a paralegal for Miller's attorney, said Miller will probably ask 
the city to pay for her medical bills, the damage to her car and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Miller is also seeking unspecified damages from the railroad, 
alleging that the train operator failed to blow a whistle or give any other 
signal as it approached the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe officials said federal law requires all train operators to sound a 
whistle when crossing a roadway, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
A security officer who said he was working at a nearby plant at the time of the 
accident disagreed, saying the train was blowing its whistle and ringing a bell 
as it crossed the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The security officer, who would not give his name, said he did not see the 
collision but was less than 20 feet away when it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The train was blowin' its horn and ringing the bell and everything," he said. 
"I heard the horn and bells, and then I heard this big bang." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Steve Ross of the Police Department's traffic department said accidents 
involving trains and automobiles occur "very, very seldom" in Torrance. "The 
last one I heard about was about 10 years ago."

BYU RALLIES BEHIND SMITH TO BEAT SDSU 
</P>

<P>
Mike Smith pulled up on the dead run, leaped into the air, his right hand 
raised high above his 6-foot, 10-inch frame and let the shot fly. It swished 
from 25 feet, and Brigham Young was on its way to an 85-81 comeback victory 
over San Diego State Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Smith would finish with a season-high 35 points and match his season high with 
11 rebounds as the Cougars rallied from a 15-point second-half deficit in front 
of 21,744 at Marriott Center to hand the Aztecs their first Western Athletic 
Conference loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Ladell Andersen) is never one to talk about shooting," Smith said. "He 
has never told me, 'Smitty, don't take that shot. You can't hit that.' He said, 
'If you're open, if it's in the flow of the game, go ahead, take it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The shot was the most spectacular of what was Smith's best all-around game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
He scored from outside. He scored on a variety of medium-range baseline 
jumpers. He tipped in his share of offensive rebounds. He even scored on the 
rebound of his own 7-footer from the left baseline as he snuck under the 
basket, popped out on the right side, grabbed the rebound and dropped in a 
7-footer from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
His job was made easier, however, by the absence of the Aztecs' best defensive 
forward, Sam Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson normally would have been assigned to guard Smith but he was a late 
scratch because of a sprained left ankle that has bothered him for 3 weeks. 
Johnson, who sat on the bench in street clothes and was replaced by freshman 
Dana Jackson, also is expected to miss Saturday's game at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Johnson was not the only handicap facing the Aztecs (8-5, 2-1 in 
conference) as point guard Bryan Williams has been ill with the flu. He played 
12 minutes in a reserve role, but made only 2 of 7 shots and had 4 assists. He 
clearly was not the same player who had recorded 34 assists in his previous 4 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' place in the starting lineup was taken by Tony Ross, who finished 
with 15 points after scoring 13 in the first half. Junior guard Michael Best 
led the Aztecs with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"You take two guys out who make it work for us and it causes problems," SDSU 
Coach Jim Bradenburg said. "Bryan couldn't even talk out there." 
</P>
<P>
But BYU (6-6, 1-2) was not at full strength, either. The Cougars have had to 
make up for the loss of forward Andy Toolson, their leading rebounder and 
second-leading scorer. Toolson had surgery Sunday to repair a broken thumb. 
</P>
<P>
His injury leaves the Cougars with only two experienced players, guard Marty 
Haws and Smith. Haws responded with 19 points and Smith was put in a more 
critical role. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say, 'Yes. I do have to carry the whole load.' That's not a 
team concept," Smith said. "That is not what we advertize or publicize. . . . 
But just by the fact that our returing guys are few now some (more) of the 
leadership and scoring load falls on my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the start that Smith, a senior center from Hacienda Heights 
Los Altos High School, was off to one of his better nights, scoring the 
Cougars' first 5 points and leading all scorers with 15 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having pretty good success in the first half," Smith said. "So at 
halftime, the coach said, 'Let's try and keep going to him. He is either going 
to get fouled or score.' " 
</P>
<P>
That was just what happened as Smith scored 14 of his points in the first 8:36 
of the second half to help bring the Cougars back from 15 points behind (55-40) 
to take a 62-61 lead on Haws' 2 free throws at 10:24. 
</P>
<P>
"(Without Johnson) we just don't have the right situation," Brandenburg said. 
"We defended (Smith) with Mitch (McMullen) a little bit, but he got in foul 
trouble and we had to get him off. Shawn Bell is not quite big enough. Then we 
have to go to a freshman. Now we got problems." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the score went back and forth for the next 8 1/2 minutes as the 
Aztecs never trailed by more than 3 points and were tied, 78-78, on Best's 2 
free throws with 2:41 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But sophomore forward Steve Schreiner made a 17-foot jump shot 51 seconds later 
and the Cougars had the lead for good at 80-78. After McMullen missed a tap of 
Bell's missed jumper at 1:03, BYU made 5 of 6 free throws to take an 85-78 lead 
with 16 seconds remaining. And reserve guard Kevin Honaker's 3-pointer with 2 
seconds left was too late to do the Aztecs much good. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU had its worst shooting of the season in the second half (8 of 27) and was 
outrebounded in the half, 22-16, after holding a 22-12 edge in the first half 
in taking a 53-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs also made twice as many turnovers as the Cougars (22-11). 
</P>
<P>
"We did all the things you need to do to win a basketball game on the road in 
the first half and all the things you can't do to win in the second half," 
Brandenburg said. "We did not take care of the ball well. We shot too quick and 
missed a bunch of layins. We lost the tempo of the game."

Bernie Nicholls said the coaches jumped all over the Kings after a lackluster 
first period, and it apparently had the desired effect as Los Angeles came out 
and blew St. Louis away, 7-4, behind Nicholls' 13th career hat trick Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we didn't play well in the first period," Nicholls said of a 
period that saw only a single goal -- by St. Louis. "Give them the credit. They 
didn't give us much. We got shouted at between periods and it got a little 
hyper in here. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get excited after one bad period. We played well in the second and 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored his third hat trick of the season in running his goal scoring 
total to 43 in 44 games, second only to Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who has 
47. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring the first Kings goal of the game, Nicholls completed his hat 
trick with a pair of goals 64 seconds apart early in the third period to expand 
what had been a 4-3 Los Angeles lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski added his 12th and 13th goals for the Kings, while rookie 
Igor Liba added a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tony McKegney collected two goals for the Blues, his 16th and 17th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have won two straight games after suffering through a five-game 
winless streak. St. Louis has won only once in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Tuttle scored the only goal of the first period at 1:45. After Nicholls' 
45-foot slap shot tied the game at 2:07 of the second period, McKegney rammed 
in a 5-footer at 3:44 to make it 2-1 Blues. The Kings then reeled off three 
straight goals to take command. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille popped in a 10-foot rebound of a shot by Sylvain Couturier at 
4:29 to tie the game at 2-2. Liba's power play goal made the score 3-2 at 8:45. 
Liba deflected in Dale De Gray's shot from the blue line past goaltender Greg 
Millen. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski's first goal at 14:27 of the second came on a 5-foot tap-in off a 
pass from Liba to make it 4-2. St. Louis closed to 4-3 with 3:30 remaining in 
the middle period when Rick Meagher beat Kings goalie Glenn Healy on a 20-foot 
wrist shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference tonight is we were down 4-3 going into the third, and we know 
it's a one-goal game," said Blues Coach Brian Sutter. "We've got to play like 
we did in the first two periods. We got away from what we do as a hockey team. 
We let it slip away. You've got to play 60 minutes -- that's concentration. 
It's not that didn't get any chances because we got the opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Kings goalie Glenn Healy won his 20th game of the season, tying him for the NHL 
lead with Philadelphia's Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we came out strong," said Healy, "and when you get a cushion you 
tend to play with a lot more confidence."

Employing a full-court press that forced 39 turnovers -- including 15 in a 
7-minute span -- the Bell-Jeff High girls' basketball team beat Chaminade, 
60-35, in a San Fernando Valley League game at Chaminade on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
After the Eagles' Judy Galido made a layup to cut Bell-Jeff's lead to 5 points 
early in the third quarter, the Guards forced Chaminade turnovers on 15 of the 
Eagles' next 17 possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff (14-0, 3-0 in league play) scored 17 consecutive points, including a 
trio of 3-point baskets by guard Lisa Negrete, who finished with 18 points. 
Negrete's long-range shooting also opened up the middle for forward Andja 
Vucurevic, who scored a game-high 23 points, including 15 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Pamela Powers led Chaminade with 10 points. Galido added 8 
points and 15 rebounds. CHRIS J. PARKER

COACH TURNS LOSERS INTO WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a good thing El Camino College women's basketball Coach Kristy Loesener 
specializes in taking over struggling programs. 
</P>
<P>
The first-year coach inherited a team that won a dismal seven games last year, 
three in the South Coast Conference. The Warriors finished with a 3-11 record 
in the SCC and 7-22 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I've always done," Loesener said. "I Take over cellar programs. I 
like that challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Loesener, who played basketball at Cal State Northridge, was the head coach for 
two years at Redlands University before coming to El Camino as a health 
instructor and women's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Before that she was an assistant coach at the University of Utah and head coach 
at University High School in Los Angeles and Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
All were struggling programs that Loesener upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
"I stress fundamentals and physical conditioning," she said. "I also think that 
as a coach I'm concerned about my players not only on the court but off it. I 
even monitor their academics." 
</P>
<P>
Loesener's system appears to be working. The Warriors are ranked No. 15 in the 
state with a 9-3 record despite having only one sophomore in the starting 
lineup, forward Melinda Brown, the team's second leading scorer (10.9 points, 
12 rebounds per game). 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors are led by freshman Kim Bly from Hawthorne High (15.6 points a 
game) and Tammy Booker, a quick freshman guard from St. Mary's High. Freshman 
forward Cheri Bullet leads the team in rebounding (17 a game). 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, El Camino crushed East L.A., 84-29, to improve its league record 
to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now our defense is our strength," Loesener said. "It initiates our fast 
break and allows us to control the boards. I think if we keep playing the way 
we have, we can at least secure second place in our conference and go to the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Loesener believes her team can reach postseason play despite the suspension of 
five players over a three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 54-51 loss to Cerritos, the Warriors had only six players since 
three were suspended for "violating team rules." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors won't have a complete roster until the second round of conference 
on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can still pull through," said Loesener, who wouldn't discuss the 
specific reason for the suspensions. "Look how good we did against Cerritos, 
and we were missing a starter and two others." 
</P>
<P>
The small but tough South Coast Conference gave the El Camino men's basketball 
team its first test on Saturday, and the Warriors did just fine, beating 
Pasadena by 12 in Lancer territory. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's league schedule may seem easy since there are only five teams in 
the SCC, but three are ranked in the state's top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos is No. 1, El Camino No. 14 and Pasadena No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Originally there were eight teams in the conference, but Compton, Fullerton and 
Golden West dropped out. That leaves Long Beach, Mt. San Antonio and the three 
top 20 teams in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, ranked No. 18 in the preseason, are steadily climbing in the 
polls and have a chance to take a big step on Saturday when they play host to 
top-ranked Cerritos at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos lost to Pasadena, 84-82, on Wednesday, and the Warriors have been 
gearing for the Falcons all week. 
</P>
<P>
Even after El Camino defeated unranked Mt. Sac, 88-67, on Wednesday, Coach Ron 
McClurkin said his team was preoccupied with the Cerritos game and played 
poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Marymount Coach Jim Masterson probably wishes his team could pull out 21-point 
victories with bad performances. 
</P>
<P>
Even at their best, the Mariners can't seem to win a Southern California 
Athletic Conference game, despite consistently strong performances from guard 
Ernie Woods and forward James Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners are 0-3 in the SCAC after Wednesday's 74-70 loss to East L.A. 
Woods scored 24 points against the Huskies and Anderson 14, but that wasn't 
enough for the Mariners, who led 31-29 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Marymount (4-13) also lost its conference opener against Barstow and two days 
later fell to Trade Tech.

COLLEGE NOTES / PAUL MCLEOD: HEY, THE OTHER WESTPHAL ISN'T BAD EITHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul McLeod 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Westphal remembers the days when his younger brother, Paul, now an 
assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Assn., was 
"just a little squirt hanging around my USC buddies" in their North Redondo 
Beach neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then he was my brother," Bill said of Paul. "Now that he's famous, I'm 
his brother." 
</P>
<P>
Both count successful careers in basketball. Paul went on to an NBA career 
after following in Bill's footsteps as a player at Aviation High School and 
USC. Now Bill, who has held a variety of coaching jobs, mostly at small 
colleges, is following in his younger brother's footsteps at Grand Canyon 
College in Phoenix. Bill, 44, replaced Paul, 37, as Antelope coach when Paul 
accepted a six-year contract with the Suns, which reportedly guarantees he'll 
be the next head coach of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Paul left big shoes to fill. Grand Canyon is the defending NAIA champion. In 
two seasons Paul posted a 63-18 record. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill (182-152, 12 seasons) is not letting brother down. The Antelopes are 
13-3. Their only losses came on a five-game, seven-day road trip to the 
Southland. The team fell to Cal State Dominguez Hills (81-73), Cal State San 
Bernardino (80-66) and UC Riverside (92-78) but won the Occidental Tournament 
with victories over Chapman College (95-77) and Occidental (88-80). 
</P>
<P>
Bill described the game with Dominguez Hills as "totally weird." 
</P>
<P>
The officials didn't show and by the time one of the replacements arrived, the 
action began 25 minutes late. Grand Canyon spent most of that time on the floor 
fiddling away a shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
The team played tired, Westphal said. It had played the night before, then 
flown to Los Angeles for the Dominguez Hills game on the first leg of an 
eight-day stay. The Antelopes never got their fast break completely untracked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just ugly," said Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes rebounded by winning the Occidental Tournament two nights later, 
but neither victories reached the century mark. A week ago Grand Canyon was 
averaging more than 100 points a game but has now scored under the century mark 
for six games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
One reason has been the loss of its leading scorer, Danl Williams, who injured 
an ankle and is out indefinitely. Without him, Westphal said, the Antelopes are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Westphal was the head coach at Occidental when Paul accepted the Phoenix 
job. Bill was itching to move his family back to Arizona where he had had a 
short-lived career in the restaurant business between coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul told (Grand Canyon) when he left, 'Don't worry, I have someone to replace 
me,' " Bill said. "Paul said: " 'That guy is my brother.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bill had been at Occidental (1973-80 and 1985-88), Western Washington 
(1983-1985) and as an assistant with the San Diego Clippers of the NBA (1982). 
</P>
<P>
At Grand Canyon Bill inherited three starters off the championship team that 
was 37-6. The team won its first 11 games, 10 with Williams in the lineup. They 
are 3-3 without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the running game," said Bill Westphal. "Without Williams we'll have to 
adapt." 
</P>
<P>
Westphal said the Antelopes are likely to play more of a tempo game. Two big 
men, 6-foot-9 Robert Enge and 6-10 Chad Olson, should be back soon. Enge sat 
out the first semester for eligibility reasons and Olson recently had a cast 
removed from an injured foot. When they are back, Westphal said, he will switch 
to a power inside game. Senior point guard Craig Johnson, from Mary Star of the 
Sea High School in San Pedro, will be told to pass more. Johnson scored 31 
points against Dominguez Hills, but "I don't necessarily want 31 points a night 
out of my point guard," Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for (Craig Johnson) to play a Magic Johnson role -- to make 
everyone else better rather than do all the scoring himself." 
</P>
<P>
Williams may or may not be back this season, which prompted Westphal to say, 
"We are by no means a shoe-in for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Bill plans to be busy in the off-season. Among other things, he and his brother 
will conduct the Westphal Brothers Basketball Camp in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Junior numbers -- Several former South Bay basketball players, all juniors, are 
performing around the country at four-year institutions. Center Elden Campbell, 
formerly of Morningside High School, is shining at Clemson. He's averaging 15.3 
points a game to lead the team, is second in rebounds with 7.5 a game and is 
shooting 55.9% from the field. He leads the Atlantic Coast Conference with 41 
blocked shots. . . . Former El Camino College standout Kirkland Howling is 
seeing playing time at Clemson. He's been in all of the Tigers' games (starting 
three), but has been inconsistent from the floor, making just 45.3% of field 
goal attempts (32% from 3-point range). He's averaging 6.3 points and about 2 
rebounds. . . . Two of his El Camino teammates from the 1988 California 
community college basketball championship team have met different fates. Center 
David Lee has played in 8 of 10 games for North Carolina State, averaging about 
7.5 minutes of action. Forward Charles White, a community college All-American 
who signed early with Purdue, is asking the Big-10 Conference to restore his 
junior year of eligibility. White played sparingly in two games, then injured a 
shoulder. Purdue officials say they believe White can qualify for a medical 
exemption, which will give him two more full years of playing time. Rumors that 
White is considering quitting are unfounded, according to the Purdue sports 
information office. . . . At UC Santa Barbara, power forward Tony Akins, 
formerly of Cal State Dominguez Hills, is the ninth man in an offensive 
strategy by Coach Jerry Pimm that relies mostly on eight players. Akins has 
played in five games for the undefeated Gauchos. He's averaging 2 points and 2 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Whistle -- Substitute referee Danny Yee of Gardena made his presence 
known quickly after the scheduled officials failed to show for the Cal State 
Dominguez Hills-Grand Canyon College basketball game last week. The Toro home 
game had begun with only one substitute official, Jim Gasso of Long Beach, when 
Yee ran onto the court. He whistled his first foul two seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Early Prediction -- Coach Dave Yanai raised a few eyebrows when he said early 
in the season that Cal State Dominguez Hills would be a contender for the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball title. Contender might seem a 
bit strong, considering that the top four teams in the preseason (UC Riverside, 
Cal State Bakersfield, Cal State Northridge and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) have 
a combined mark of 40-10 while Dominguez Hills is only 7-5. Nevertheless, 
Yanai, a plotter, strategist, knows he doesn't have to take first place in the 
regular season to be a "contender." What he wants to do is position the Toros 
to grab one of the top four spots so they can advance to the CCAA postseason 
tournament where, Yanai said, anything can happen in a single-elimination 
format. Last season Dominguez Hills, which tied for fourth place, won seven of 
its last 10 CCAA games and in one of those losses had Riverside on the ropes. 
By winning three of its last four games this preseason, Dominguez Hills is 
looking more and more like a serious threat for no worse than the fourth spot 
in the CCAA. Not to be overlooked are the facts that two of its losses came in 
overtime after blowing big leads. In addition, an exhibition win over a 
Canadian team does not count in NCAA rules. "Dominguez Hills is much improved," 
said Riverside Coach John Masi. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The 68 points scored by Enoch Simmons in the last two basketball games has 
given the Loyola senior more than 1,000 for his career. He entered the week 
with 1,050, putting him 17th on the Lions' career list.

ROHR PLANNING RESEARCH SITE IN CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what Chula Vista officials see as an affirmation of its largest employer's 
long-term commitment to their city, Rohr Industries said Thursday it plans to 
build a major office, research and engineering facility on an 11.5-acre parcel 
of land that it acquired this week for $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr, a booming aerospace manufacturer, declined to release details of its 
plans for the property, which is next to and north of its 150-acre complex on 
Chula Vista's bay front at H Street. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr also declined to say what it will spend developing the site. Before 
construction can begin, Rohr faces a plan review that could take a year or 
more, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But Chula Vista redevelopment director Paul Desrochers said the land could 
easily accommodate more than 500,000 square feet of office and light industrial 
buildings. Rohr eventually will build at least one multistory building on the 
site, perhaps a headquarters office structure, Desrochers said. 
</P>
<P>
Boosted by increased worldwide demand for commercial aircraft, Rohr has 
experienced rapid growth over the last two years, causing the company to 
convert much of the research and engineering space at its H Street facility 
into manufacturing use. Rohr makes a variety of jet engine components, 
including rings, nacelles and thrust reversers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 18 months, Rohr's payroll has grown from 8,000 to 11,000 
employees, more than 6,400 of whom work in Chula Vista. Of Rohr's 5.5 million 
square feet of plant space companywide, about half is in Chula Vista, company 
spokesman Dick Dalton said Thursday. The rest is at eight other sites in the 
United States and France. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr's sales for the fiscal year ended July 31 were $906.8 million, up 46% from 
the $663.4 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr bought the land from Chula Vista Investors, an investment entity headed by 
William J. Barkett. Barkett acquired the property and about 110 more acres on 
the Chula Vista bay front in September from a joint venture of Santa Fe 
Southern Pacific Corp. and Watt Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Barkett has told the city that he plans to build two 26-story hotel towers 
totaling 1,800 rooms on the land just north of the parcel sold to Rohr. The 
Radisson Hotel chain has expressed interest in operating one of the planned 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
The land sale has been sought by both Rohr and Chula Vista for many years, 
Mayor Greg Cox said Thursday. In fact, Chula Vista's redevelopment agency 
assisted Barkett in acquiring the land by giving him a $3.25-million "bridge 
loan" to cover the cost of the parcel destined for Rohr. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted over the sale of the property," Cox said. "It's a good sign 
for Rohr and a healthy sign for the city in that it will solidify Rohr's 
presence for years into the future."

Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell to the lowest level since 
November. The Treasury Department sold $9 billion of the bills at an average 
discount rate of 8.45%, down from 8.49% at the last auction Dec. 15. The rates 
were the lowest since Nov. 17, when the one-year bills sold for 7.92%. The new 
discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 9.16% with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,145.60.

The narrowest measure of the nation's money supply, M1, rose $6.7 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted $793.1 billion from $786.4 billion in the week ended Jan. 
2, the Federal Reserve Board reported. Its growth in 1988 was 4.3%. A broader 
measure, M2, rose $3.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,068.7 billion, from 
$3,065.6 billion the week before. M2 grew 5.4% in 1988, according to a 
comparison of the last 13 weeks of 1988 with the last 13 weeks of 1987. M1 
includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank 
travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money market 
mutual funds.

PREVIEW: BEHIND THE MASKS OF 'AFRICAN FOLK TALES' HIDE PARABLES OF FRIENDSHIP

The Actors for Children theater troupe usually performs in elementary school 
classrooms and at assemblies. But Wednesday, the group will make a rare public 
appearance at the Thousand Oaks Library, which means parents will be able to 
see the show too. 
</P>
<P>
The theater troupe, which just finished a four-performance series at the Los 
Angeles Children's Museum last weekend, has toured the Ventura and L.A. areas 
since its inception in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done everything from traditional fairy tales to a play based on the 
'Guinness Book of World Records' -- once we even did an anti-war play done with 
broad strokes of mime and vaudeville," said Naomi Monroe, the group's founder 
who produces and directs all the shows. "I always look for language in the 
scripts that is not condescending. We don't want the kids to feel that some 
authority figure is stuffing something down their throats." 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's show, five actors -- Michael Lee Jones Jr., Toni Frish-Beery, 
Eileen McLoone, Ann West and Larry Woods -- will perform "African Folk Tales," 
a series of four stories written by Anita Gustafson. The central figure in the 
tales is a mouse who becomes a storyteller to help him make friends in the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this show special for Monroe are the masks the actors will wear in 
the production. They were created by Barbara Bouman Jay, a Newbury Park artist 
who lived in Africa for 1 1/2 years. "They're really works of art," Monroe 
said, "but they're functional too. It took her all summer to create them." 
</P>
<P>
The actors always make a point of putting the masks on in front of the 
audience. "We want to make it clear that these are actors," Monroe said. "We 
don't want the kids to be frightened." 
</P>
<P>
African instruments -- a drum from Rwanda, a flute from Kenya, Pygmy goat bells 
and other shakers and noisemakers -- are used to enhance the authenticity of 
the stories. At Wednesday's show, there will be an exhibit of African 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, who runs a casting service for commercials, doesn't limit her theater 
work to children. She is also the artistic producing director of the Xanadu 
Theatre Company. During the summer, the group performs at Cal Lutheran 
University; other times they can be seen at the Conejo Community Center and 
other venues -- the group has no permanent theater. 
</P>
<P>
But she believes that her work for children's audiences is especially 
important. "I found there was a tremendous ned to introduce children to quality 
theater," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't hard to find others interested in her project. "At first I leaned on 
my contacts in the business to find actors," Monroe said, "but now that our 
reputation has grown, actors have been calling me. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think it takes three times as much energy to perform before a children's 
audience. Kids have such short attention spans; to keep their interest you have 
to be physically more active and more mentally alert than you would before an 
audience of adults." 
</P>
<P>
 The Actors for Children troupe performs "African Folk Tales" by Anita 
Gustafson Jan. 18 at the Thousand Oaks Library, 1401 E. Janss Road, Thousand 
Oaks. Performance begins at 7 p.m. Admission is free but reservations are 
required. Call (805) 497-6282.

A law requiring rest breaks and special training for many workers using video 
display terminals went into effect in a Long Island, N.Y., county despite a 
legal challenge. Suffolk County health officials, who will enforce the law, 
estimated that it applies to 8,500 VDT users in 150 to 200 businesses. The 
measure is believed to be the first VDT-regulating law enacted by a local 
government. A state Supreme Court judge is expected to rule within the next two 
weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses.

Accidental release of an arsenic compound at a Hewlett-Packard Co. 
manufacturing facility in north San Jose injured five workers, fire officials 
said. Five production workers at the plant were overcome by fumes released by a 
malfunctioning gallium arsenide reactor, officials said. Four victims were 
treated at a hospital and released, a company spokeswoman said. Another worker 
was treated at the scene. Gallium arsenide, a mixture of gallium and arsenic, 
is used in the production of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the spokeswoman 
said. LEDs are the illuminated digital readouts on clock radios, other 
electronic appliances and automobile instrument panels.

NEW ARRIVALS; 
</P>
<P>
CAVALIERS, ONCE THE NBA'S DOORMATS, NOW ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, there was a pro basketball team so laughingly mismanaged, so lacking in 
talent and support that it made the Clippers, Indiana Pacers and other National 
Basketball Assn. have-nots seem successful by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the Cleveland Cavaliers defined futility in professional 
sports. They were owned by the notorious Ted Stepien, the poor man's George 
Steinbrenner. They dealt away promising players and draft picks with such 
frequency that league officials had to intervene. They were called the 
Cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
But not anymore. The team that will play the Lakers tonight at 7:30 at the 
Forum is nothing like those abysmal Cleveland teams earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may strike some as incredible, Cleveland has the NBA's best record at 
25-6. The Cavaliers, whose franchise-record 11-game winning streak was ended at 
Seattle Monday night, lead the Central Division by 4 games over the Detroit 
Pistons, one of last season's championship finalists, and by 5 over the 
star-saturated Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers have accomplished this restoration with planning, stability, 
leadership and, most of all, talented young players. A laughingstock in the 
early '80s and a rebuilder in the middle of the decade, Cleveland, as Magic 
Johnson recently said, may be the team of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are, however, that the precocious Cavaliers may reach that level 
sooner, perhaps even this season. 
</P>
<P>
Under the stable ownership of the Gund brothers, George III and Gordon, the 
savvy reconstruction of General Manager Wayne Embry and the patient teaching of 
Coach Lenny Wilkens, the Cavaliers seemingly have the talent and temperament to 
mount a serious challenge in May and June. 
</P>
<P>
They have one of the league's best transition offenses, led by guards Ron 
Harper and Mark Price, who account for an average of 38 points a game. They 
have a formidable inside game, due to Brad Daugherty, perhaps the NBA's best 
young center, and all-star forward Larry Nance. 
</P>
<P>
Their swarming, rotating defense has held opponents below 100 points in 20 
games, 19 of them victories. They also have a mostly veteran supporting cast, 
led by John (Hot Rod) Williams, that has been favorably compared to Detroit's 
deep bench. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that all that the Cavaliers lack is experience. So far this season, 
though, their immaturity has surfaced only occasionally. Until the last-second 
loss to the SuperSonics, Cleveland's last defeat was by the Lakers on Dec. 13 
at the Richfield Coliseum. That game also was the Lakers' last road victory. 
</P>
<P>
But NBA skeptics look at Cleveland's youth and believe -- hope? -- that playoff 
pressure will postpone the Cavaliers' charge until the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since we went 8-0 in the (exhibition) season, I think people were 
thinking we were going to fall apart in the regular season," Harper said. "It 
just showed that a bunch of young players who play together can win games. Once 
we get to the playoffs, if we get the home-court (advantage), ain't no telling 
what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Embry's enthusiasm, however, is more temperate. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know with a young team," he said. "I guess people would have a right 
to be skeptical because of our youth. But also, young teams are unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very conservative. We know the NBA. We are in a very tough division. It 
could change. But our attitude is, let's not get carried away with what our 
record is, because it's not important. Let's just be pleased with our progress, 
because we haven't won anything yet." Actually, they already have won something 
-- respect from the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff recently proclaimed: "I don't see any 
weaknesses there." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, the Lakers' coach, said he detects similarities in the current 
Cavaliers and the Lakers, circa 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an innocent climb they are making," Riley said. "It's got to be a fun 
time for them, because they are learning about themselves. We were that way in 
1980. I guess we should check back in 9 years and see if (the Cavaliers) are 
still together. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they are talented, but they don't have to play yet with a lot of 
expectations. It's easy to play from that position. It's going to be 
interesting to see if they can sustain it in the second half of the season. I 
think they will." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkens, always the cautious type, stopped short of making any claims after the 
loss to Seattle in the opening game of the Cavaliers' Western trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we're an elite team yet," he said. "But we are a very good 
team." 
</P>
<P>
This development has not taken place overnight. Or over a season, either. It 
began back in 1983, when the Gunds mercifully bought the team from Stepien and 
vowed patience and persistence in trying to build a winner. 
</P>
<P>
They took a major step toward that in the summer of 1986, hiring Embry as 
general manager and Wilkens as coach. Just before their official appointments, 
the Cavaliers had a bountiful draft, which Embry helped supervise. 
</P>
<P>
That draft week was an unusual time for Cavalier management. Embry was in 
transit between a lesser position at Indiana, and, with the league's blessing, 
he advised both the Pacers and Cavaliers on prospective first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
After trading Roy Hinson to Philadelphia to receive the first overall pick of 
the draft from the 76ers, the Cavaliers selected North Carolina's 7-foot 1-inch 
Daugherty, who was said by some to be too soft to dominate in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the eighth overall pick, which the league sold to the Cavaliers to 
make amends for Stepien's mistakes, they selected Harper, from Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
That week, the Cavaliers also learned that Williams, who was drafted in 1985 
and is now a valuable sixth man, had been cleared of point-shaving charges at 
Tulane and was eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, amid all the other draft-day activity, the Cavaliers completed 
what appeared to be a less significant deal by acquiring the draft rights to 
Georgia Tech's Price from the Dallas Mavericks for a second-round pick and 
future considerations. Gordon Gund has called it the most important week in the 
franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
And Embry said: "That draft gave us a good foundation. We got a quality center 
and two guards." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986-87, Harper was the runner-up in the NBA's rookie-of-the-year balloting 
and Daugherty showed promise, but Price did not immediately live up to 
expectations, and the painfully young Cavaliers finished 31-51, missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, however, Price's outside shot returned, enabling Embry to trade 
guard Kevin Johnson, the club's 1987 first-round pick, along with Mark West, 
Tyrone Corbin and the 1988 first-round pick to Phoenix for Nance and Mike 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Embry said that he hesitated giving up a first-round pick but that he and 
Wilkens belived that the Cavaliers needed to improve their inside game with 
Nance, who is averaging 18.3 points and 8 rebounds this season, and their 
half-court game with Sanders, a former UCLA star. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the trade was completed in February, the Cavaliers' new 
combination began to thrive. They won 11 of their last 13 regular-season games 
before being bumped off in the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
All along, Embry and Wilkens have concentrated on bolstering the Cavaliers' 
bench. Journeyman Craig Ehlo was signed in 1986 and has become a defensive 
specialist. Reserve center Chris Dudley, from Yale by way of Solana Beach, was 
taken in the fourth round in 1987. Guard Darnell Valentine was acquired from 
Miami for a second-round draft pick. And Tree Rollins was signed as a free 
agent to back up Daugherty and, as it turned out, Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers have seemingly made all the right moves, for once. But at the 
time, question marks abounded: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Could Daugherty be the dominant center around whom to build a team? 
</P>
<P>
Daugherty's critics labeled him not aggressive enough, a criticism similar to 
what Kareem Abdul-Jabbar heard coming out of UCLA in 1969. "I watched him from 
the time he was a freshman to his senior year, and he showed tremendous 
improvement each year," Embry said of Daugherty, who is averaging 19.1 points 
and 9 rebounds. "He was only 20 coming out of college, which meant there was 
greater growth in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever gave him that soft label is certainly mistaken. He's anything but 
soft. In fact, his body's still toning up more. I've always liked his touch 
around the basket and his fundamental skills. Very seldom do you find a center 
that passes the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Could Harper, despite his outstanding rookie season, develop an outside 
shot to give him a complete offensive game? 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot 6-inch guard whose specialty is driving to the basket, Harper averaged 
22.9 points and 4.8 assists as a rookie. But last season, he missed 24 games 
with a sprained ankle and shot just 46% from the field, and his scoring average 
dipped to 15.4. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harper said that over the summer, he worked at developing a better 
outside shot to augment his drives to the basket. This season he leads the 
Cavaliers with a 20.6 scoring average and is shooting 51.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, everybody was saying I was through," Harper said. "So I went home 
and worked hard on my game, trying to add something new. Everybody thought that 
I could just go to the hole. But I'm still developing as a player." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Which Price would show up in 1988-89, the one who shot 40.8% his rookie 
season or the one who shot 50.6% last season? 
</P>
<P>
This was a $5-million question to the Cavaliers. During the off-season, 
Washington signed Price to a 5-year, $5-million offer sheet, which the 
Cavaliers promptly matched. Price is currently the team's fourth-leading scorer 
at 17.7, is shooting 51.4% and has made 24 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of things going on my first year," Price said. "I wasn't 
playing a lot of minutes. I had to adjust to the NBA. Plus, I was out a month 
after an appendectomy. After that, I wasn't in playing shape the rest of the 
season. It was a real struggle. But last season, I was healthy and things 
turned around." 
</P>
<P>
Price improved his scoring average from 6.9 points in 1986-87 to 16 last 
season. Not coincidentally, his salary went from $175,000 to $1 million. "I 
can't go out thinking I have to prove I'm worth a million dollars," Price said. 
"I've played pretty well this season, but I only know one way to play. I can't 
change that, no matter what I'm paid." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Could Wilkens, who reportedly lost his job in Seattle in 1985 because of a 
perceived inability to relate to a young team, handle this collection of NBA 
prodigies? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Embry said. "Lenny's demeanor, meaning his patience and teaching 
abilities, is very compatible to coaching younger players. He's obviously 
proven he can coach. He's calm, but he can be firm. He has demonstrated the 
ability to establish discipline, too." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one games into the season, the Cavaliers have answered every question 
and almost every challenge. But, perhaps a little surprised themselves, 
Cavalier players say they are not looking beyond tonight's meeting with the 
Lakers, who handed the Cavaliers only their second loss in the last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us thought we'd have the kind of record we have at this 
point," Price said. "It's a long season. Everybody knows we can't continue at 
this pace. But we're trying to be consistent. We still have Detroit and Atlanta 
to deal with during the season and eventually in the playoffs. Those teams will 
be tough to beat, since they've been there before. That's where we're trying to 
get to." 
</P>
<P>
As good as the Cavaliers are now, the scary thought to the rest of the NBA has 
to be the possibility that they will get significantly better. After all, 
Daugherty is 23, Price and Harper are not yet 25 and Williams is 26. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can get better because of our youth," Embry said. "Even Larry 
(Nance) is just 29, and there still is growth to be had with our youth 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harper: "We're still trying to learn the game of basketball. We're 
definitely gonna get better."

UCLA RALLIES TO BEAT USC ON A POOH SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pooh Richardson, UCLA's senior point guard, has developed a reputation as one 
of the coolest players in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
When the game is on the line, Richardson is at his best. 
</P>
<P>
The USC-UCLA game was on the line Thursday night, and Richardson came through 
once again for the Bruins, hitting a jumper from the top of the key with 11 
seconds remaining as UCLA defeated USC, 67-66, before 6,319 fans at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The play wasn't designed for Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
"The last play was designed for me," said UCLA forward Don MacLean, who scored 
15 points. "I was supposed to come off a pick down low and take the shot. But 
Pooh, being a senior, wanted to take the shot. He had a perfect shot and he 
nailed it." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, wide open after he came around a screen by Kevin Walker, fired up 
an 18-foot jumper. The shot hit nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great screen," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "They had been switching 
it all night, but they didn't switch it that time, and he was wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have hit the shot. He didn't play very well the whole game and that 
certainly isn't like him to not perform. 
</P>
<P>
Although Richardson was the hero, he didn't play very well as the Bruins got 
off to a poor start and trailed at halftime, 41-31. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson finished with 9 points, making just 4 of 10 shots, and 9 assists, 
but he gave away 6 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, however, redeemed himself in the end. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a shot that I had to make," Richardson said. "I'm not going to 
give those kinds of shots up. You take those." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Trojans had two timeouts remaining, they didn't use one to set up 
a final play after Richardson's shot. 
</P>
<P>
USC guard Rich Grande raced the ball upcourt and fed Alan Pollard, who missed a 
desperation shot from the top of the key at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans seemed confused on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Grande said they thought they could surprise the Bruins by not calling a 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"As you look back, sure everyone says that we should have called time out," 
Grande said. "But we wanted to catch them off guard. I've got to give them 
credit. They executed (at the end), and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach George Raveling said: "We had a play set up but it wasn't properly 
executed. We wanted to get the ball to (Anthony) Pendleton off the double 
screen, but we just didn't execute it right. We had done a good job scoring off 
the option." 
</P>
<P>
Pollard said he probably should have tried to get closer to the basket before 
taking the last shot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I caught the ball, I only had 5 seconds left and I didn't see anything 
open," Pollard said. "So I just put it up. I probably should have tried to take 
a few more dribbles before I shot, to get closer to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played a very good game. It just gets so frustrating to keep 
losing like this. I know we're not as bad as people think we are. If we're the 
worst team in the Pac-10, then it must be a hell of a league or a real bad 
one." 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by as many as 12 points in the first half, UCLA stifled the 
Trojans in the second half, limiting them to 4 points in the first 9 minutes 
after halftime to get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
USC shot only 33% in the second half, UCLA 57%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense did it for us," Harrick said. "We were down digging and playing," 
Harrick said. "I give them credit. We were probably fortunate to win. Maybe 
they (the Trojans) are the heartbreak kids." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is 9-3 overall and 4-1 in the Pacific 10. USC, losing for the 6th time in 
7 games, fell to 7-8 and 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating game for the Trojans, who have been unable to win close 
ones this season. USC has lost 5 games by 5 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, who led the Trojans with 14 points, symbolized USC's frustration. He 
collapsed to the court and banged his head on the floor after Pollard's shot 
bounced harmlessly off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson led UCLA with 17 points, and Walker added 14 as the Bruins won 
for the first time this season after trailing at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Banks, Chris Munk and Polland scored 10 points apiece for USC. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 6-0, at the start, the Trojans took command with a 15-5 run to 
forge a 21-11 lead midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's offense never got into sync as the Bruins missed easy inside shots and 
committed 10 turnovers. UCLA missed 17 of 30 shots in the first half, shooting 
43.3%. 
</P>
<P>
But things were different in the second half as the Bruins blitzed the Trojans, 
17-2, in the first 7 1/2 minutes to pull ahead. MacLean keyed the spurt with 6 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans fought back with a 13-2 run to take a 58-54 lead. The game went 
back and forth before the Bruins took a 65-64 lead when MacLean hit a 17-footer 
with 2:26 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Grande and Chris Moore each made one free throw to give USC a 66-65 lead before 
UCLA called time out with 21 seconds left to set up Richardson's game-winning 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
After playing poorly in an 82-69 loss at Oregon State Sunday night, the Bruins 
played just well enough in the second half Thursday night to beat USC.

JIM MURRAY: A 12-HANDICAPPER IS A SIGHT FOR JOY, THANKS TO HIS WORK 
</P>

PALM DESERT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were Hall of Fame baseball players, Pro Bowl football players, movie 
stars, talk-show hosts, sportscasters and 128 of the finest golfers in the 
world abroad on the fairways of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament. 
</P>
<P>
So I went out in search of a player who was not even-money to break 90, will 
never play for the Green Bay Packers, make a playoff at Augusta. In fact, you 
might have to give him strokes at your home course and hope he'd press you on 
the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
But when I saw the name, Charlie Kelman, on a pairing sheet, his golf game was 
the most irrelevant thing I could think of. I went up to one of his playing 
partners, whom I knew. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you know of this fellow Kelman in your foursome?" I wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
My friend tried to be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a bad grip, but he can play some. He'll help a shot or two." 
</P>
<P>
"No, no!" I protested. "What I want to know is, is he a doctor? More 
specifically, is he an eye doctor?" 
</P>
<P>
The fellow looked puzzled. "I think he owns drug stores," he said. "Or maybe 
it's dress shops." 
</P>
<P>
There are 384 amateur players in the Hope tournament, ranging from scratch 
players to 18s. To a man, they think they're 3 to 5 shots better than they are. 
Golf is not a game, it's a delusion. 
</P>
<P>
But no one ever pays much attention to these hackers. No one wants their 
autographs on anything but a check. The pros tolerate them. The charities need 
them. They pay up to $8,600 to tee it up in here. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate America is well represented here. Guys who could shake up Wall Street 
with a phone call apologize abjectly to a club pro for a missed putt. They 
might terrorize a board room but here, they're the ones eager to please. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrity in Team No. A-36 was the great catcher, Johnny Bench, just 
elected to baseball's Hall of Fame on his first try. The pro was the meticulous 
Calvin Peete, who hasn't been off a fairway or behind a tree with a shot this 
decade. The team was 7 under par, if you care for trivia. 
</P>
<P>
If your vision is 20/20, if you have two eyes, if you never flunked an eye 
chart in your life, your interest in Team A-36 would begin and end with the 
greatest 1-man Bench in baseball history or one of the straightest pros on the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
But if you'd ever looked out at a Miami street sign and it looked as if it were 
written in Mandarin Chinese, you might want the autograph of the 12-handicap in 
the group. If you'd ever lain in a hospital bed with bandages over both eyes 
the morning after an operation, you'd know who Charlie Kelman was. 
</P>
<P>
It was some years ago, after several months of virtual sightlessness, vision 
gone in one eye and a dense cataract in the middle of another and a suspect 
retina behind it, that I stood in the office of Dr. Otto Jungschaffer. 
</P>
<P>
"There is controversy over the best way to remove a cataract, and I do not take 
part in it," he explained to me. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the traditional method and there is the method invented by a Dr. 
Kelman, in which the cataract is extruded by an ultrasonic technique. While I 
do not involve myself, I would say in your case, the Kelman 
phaco-emulsification procedure is indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"There are four doctors who are the world's best at this operation -- Dr. 
Kelman in New York, Dr. Liddle in Oklahoma City, a doctor in Houston and Dr. 
Richard Kratz here in Van Nuys." 
</P>
<P>
A few nights afterward, I was able to look up and see one of the most wonderful 
sights in the world, a television screen that didn't look like a pot of 5-color 
paint being stirred, a picture on which it was possible to read a quarterback's 
number. Doctors Kratz, Jungschaffer -- and Kelman -- had given me back the most 
precious gift a man can have: his sight. 
</P>
<P>
So, to me, the celebrity on the course at Eldorado one day this week was not 
necessarily next year's Cy Young Award winner or future Masters champion, but a 
determined, 50ish New Yorker with just a hint of a loop in his backswing, a 
forward press right out of a Tommy Armour golf book and a golf cap that looked 
as if it came with a tractor. 
</P>
<P>
I am afraid I interfered with golfer Kelman's concentration. The spectators 
thought the guy with the press badge on his sweater had gotten a businessman 
player mixed up with the pro in the group. 
</P>
<P>
I had made no mistake. If there were a Cooperstown for eye doctors, this man 
would make it. Eyes are more important than birdies. I didn't want to know how 
his round was going, I was interested in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Kelman was not going to win any glassware with this round, but he broke 
a course record years ago when he perfected the method of removing a cataract 
with the use of a needle prick and an ultrasound machine. It is almost as 
casual as removing a sliver. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists decried it, but today it is a universal tactic for cataract 
surgery, practiced all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"How did I happen to perfect it?" Dr. Kelman echoed as he stood over a trap 
shot. "Well, my cataract patients used to have to stay in the hospital for 10 
days and then spend 6 weeks in recovery period at home. One day, I was in the 
dentist's office, and he had this ultra-sonic probe and drill. I began to 
wonder why this couldn't be modified for cataract extraction." 
</P>
<P>
It could. And he did it. His first patient was a woman whose eye was so ravaged 
by diabetes, she had little to lose. The technique was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Next was a ticker-tape parade? Eye surgeon of the month? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Next was a 7-year fight with the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked with cats in the basement of my house. My wife almost threw me and 
them out. My practice suffered. I went broke. But I was stubborn. I couldn't 
see why cataract patients had to go through having their eye slit open, having 
to have 12 stitches and a long recuperative period, versus maybe one suture, if 
any at all, and being able to see right away." 
</P>
<P>
He got a reputation for being cantankerous, abrasive. The fact that he was 
right got lost in the noise. 
</P>
<P>
"There was also the fact I used to play the saxophone," he said. "On television 
and on stage with Lionel Hampton. They said, 'How can he be any kind of an eye 
surgeon when he plays the saxophone in Jersey?' They said it was too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"By now, I was operating on famous people, congressmen, senators. Great doctors 
began to see its advantage. Dick Kratz was one of the first to join with me, 
one of the first to believe in it. Now, everybody does it." 
</P>
<P>
He is working on a modification of his technique to remove brain tumors. "My 
father was an inventor," he said. "I like to find better ways to do important 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The golfer Charlie Kelman would like to find better ways to make 3s. He became 
hooked on golf about 10 years ago and has, typically, become good enough to 
play in advanced tournaments like the Hope. This is his second. 
</P>
<P>
His swing is precise, as was to be expected. He is a bold player, as was also 
to be expected. Surgeons do not deal in negatives. 
</P>
<P>
On the 11th hole at Eldorado Wednesday, the golfer Kelman bladed one out of a 
trap. It squirted off at right angles to the green just off the fringe into the 
deep grass. 
</P>
<P>
It is standard for the amateur partner when he has lost all chance to make par, 
to pick up his ball and head for the next tee. I thought Dr. Kelman, lying 3 in 
the deep rough, might honor this custom. I hauled out the notebook. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just make notes while you pick up," I explained. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at me as if I had just stepped on his ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick up?" he said. "I might chip this in!" 
</P>
<P>
Just for the record, Billy Casper would have had trouble chipping it in. But 
also for the record, Charlie Kelman damned near did. He looked surprised when 
he didn't.

TORRANCE BOWLING TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
BOHN IS STILL THE LEADER AFTER 4 ROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Roth was cranking away as usual Thursday on the lanes at Gable House Bowl 
in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The "cranker shot" that the New Jersey Hall of Famer introduced 17 years ago 
was working well enough to stay reasonably close to the leaders after 4 rounds 
(26 games) of the AC/Delco Pro Bowlers Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In the lead was Parker Bohn III, the New Jersey lefty. 
</P>
<P>
Bohn will have Roth, who is in 19th place, and 22 other semifinalists chasing 
him into 16 more games of match play today and tonight to decide 5 finalists 
for Saturday's title rolloff. 
</P>
<P>
The original 160-man field was reduced to 24 earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Three Southern Californians made the cut -- Randy Pedersen of Santa Maria 
(2nd), Earl Ziemann of Garden Grove (8th) and Tom Underwood of Long Beach 
(11th). 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 70% of the bowlers on the tour now crank the 
ball in various forms because of its proven strike proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
On the shot, a bowler basically locates his hand underneath the ball on the arm 
swing. At the release, he cranks or turns the hand, causing the ball to spin on 
its way to land on the lane. The rotating action on the ball continues as it 
slides along the slick oiled portion of the alley until it reaches a dry area, 
where it hooks into the pins with a blast. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, the classic bowling style featuring a smooth stroke prevailed," 
according to Mike Sands, PBA official. "But harder finishes came along to 
replace lacquer and other softer lane dressings because of economical and 
safety reasons. Taking note of Roth's successes, other bowlers have taken to 
cranking the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot 11-inch, 180-pound Roth, 37, is the all-time PBA money champion 
($1,360,056). His 8 titles in 1978 set a single-year record. He has 33 titles 
in all, second only to the 41 of retired Earl Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
Roth's footwork is puzzling since bowlers by and large use the same number of 
steps on each shot. Ask Roth how many steps he took on his last shot and his 
answer is liable to be, "I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow pro Mark Baker of Garden Grove said Roth's approach starts with little 
hesitation. "He just starts up, shuffling toward the line, taking as many as 5 
to 8 steps before letting go of the ball."

Defending World Cup champion Michela Figini led the Swiss to three of the top 
four places in a World Cup downhill race at Grindelwald, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Figini, 22, was timed in 1 minute 55.82 seconds for 3,062 meters, the longest 
women's downhill on the circuit this season. Half a second behind was Swiss 
teammate Beatrice Gafner. Carole Merle of France was third, and Maria Walliser

ANGELS SIGN NEW PITCHER; ROJAS ACCEPTS OLD JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels signed free-agent pitcher Bob McClure Thursday and announced that 
Cookie Rojas, who was fired as manager in September, had accepted an offer to 
return to his former position of advance scout at the major league level. 
</P>
<P>
McClure, 35, is a 13-year major league veteran who formerly pitched for the 
Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, Montreal Expos and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
He was released by the Expos last July 5 and finished the season with the Mets, 
compiling an overall record of 2-3 with 3 saves and a 5.40 earned-run average 
in 33 appearances. He has a 56-52 career record with 49 saves and a 3.88 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said that McClure enhances the Angels' left-handed 
relief corps, previously represented only by Sherman Corbett, a rookie last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
McClure's contract with the Angels guarantees him $200,000. Agent Alan Meersand 
also negotiated a provision by which McClure will receive $412.09 for each day 
he is on the major league roster. If he remains for the entire season, he will 
receive $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a player with 5 or more years of major league service, McClure had the right 
to refuse assignment to the minor leagues, but he waived it in return for the 
guarantee. Thus, the Angels can assign him to the minors, but the terms of his 
contract will remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas, in returning to the organization and the job he held from 1982 through 
1987, said his decision was based on familiarity with the Angels, the league 
and the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier than making the jump to another team," he said from his 
Miami home. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had received repeated assurances from club owners Gene and Jackie 
Autry that they wanted him to remain with the organization, and he said that he 
was not embittered by his managerial firing. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," he said. "That's the way it is in baseball. I wasn't the only 
manager fired last year. I'm just looking forward to the season and hoping that 
someday I'll get another chance to manage."

MORNING BRIEFING: BOOMER GETS OFF FIRST SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Boomer Esiason of the Cincinnati Bengals went to New York this week 
to accept the Schick trophy as the National Football League's most valuable 
player from the Pro Football Writers of America. 
</P>
<P>
While he was there, he got a jump on the Super Bowl hype. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the football writers said Boomer Esiason hasn't reached his 
potential and the Cincinnati Bengals were going to fire the coach," Esiason 
said. "I had a lot of nice names for you back then. Now this year, you're all 
my buddies." 
</P>
<P>
Add Boomer: Of his idol, former Baltimore Colts quarterback Bert Jones, Esiason 
said: "The first thing my wife and I had in common was that we both loved Bert 
Jones. I liked his arm, she liked his butt." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Boomer: The Bengals won't get to Miami, where the Super Bowl will be 
played Jan. 22 against the San Francisco 49ers, until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Esiason can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be down there now to get acclimated to the weather," Esiason 
said. "(Monday,) I spent a great deal of time in the steam room trying to 
simulate what it might be like down there." 
</P>
<P>
Rise and fall in the Big East: This conference has been one of the most 
competitive in recent years, but what's happening so far this season doesn't 
always add up. St. John's lost by a school-record 29 points to Providence, then 
bounced back and beat Villanova by 19. Syracuse lost by 5 to struggling 
Pittsburgh, then routed unbeaten Seton Hall by 24. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall upset Georgetown before its one-sided defeat by Syracuse. Pitt upset 
Syracuse at the Carrier Dome, then lost to Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
The Jekyll-Hyde routine is driving coaches to distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pitt's Paul Evans: "I was thinking of not having practice (the day after 
losing to Boston College) because I might kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Bench of the Cincinnati Reds, when he and Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston 
Red Sox were voted into baseball's Hall of Fame this week, took a swipe at the 
free agency era. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be the last two guys (to make the Hall of Fame) who played with the 
same club our whole career," Bench said. "I don't think we'll have to decide 
what uniform to hang up there." 
</P>
<P>
When rookie guard Rex Chapman of the Charlotte Hornets was at Kentucky, some 
observers were comparing him with Hall of Fame player Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
Said scout Marty Blake: "If I had $100 for every 'next Jerry West' I've seen, I 
could have retired long ago. I think Chapman would do well to be the next Danny 
Ainge." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
St. John's basketball Coach Lou Carnesecca, 64, when asked how long he intends 
to coach: "I'm going to keep going, going until they take it away. Hopefully, 
I'm smart enough to get out before I die with my boots on, but I'm not Errol 
Flynn, you know."

FIESTA BOWL DEFEATS ROSE BOWL IN TV RATINGS RACE, 17.0 TO 10.8

<P>
NBC's telecast of the Fiesta Bowl football game between national champion Notre 
Dame and West Virginia on Jan. 2 drew a 17.0 national rating, the highest of 
any bowl game this year, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing opposite the Fiesta Bowl, ABC's Rose Bowl had a 10.8 rating, lowest in 
the television history of the game, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
The rating means an average of 17% of all U.S. TV households were tuned into 
the Fiesta Bowl, or about 15.4 million households. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fiesta Bowl, of course, was for the national championship, and it was the 
highest-rated of the year, facing what traditionally is the highest-rated bowl 
game," NBC research specialist Gray Seamans said. "And we beat it handily -- by 
57%." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Cotton Bowl, in which UCLA defeated Arkansas, drew a 9.8 rating, lowest in 
its history, and the Hall of Fame Bowl on NBC had an 8.1. The Citrus Bowl, on 
ABC, had a 7.2 rating. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings were announced earlier for NBC's Orange Bowl, 12.8, and ABC's 
Sugar Bowl, 8.1, which were shown against one another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Seamans said the highest-rated bowl game ever was the Orange Bowl's national 
championship showdown 2 years ago, which had a 25.1 rating.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: CBS UP IN THE AIR ON BASEBALL JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporters who cover television for many of the nation's newspapers are holed up 
at the Registry Hotel in Universal City for a 16-day event called a press tour. 
</P>
<P>
The reporters attend various sessions to listen to and question television 
executives, producers and stars talk about future programs and pertinent 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
At one session this week was Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
A Buffalo, N.Y., reporter directed this at Pilson: "The nation is awaiting in 
fear of the possibility of Brent Musburger on baseball. Is it going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Pilson, whose network will begin televising baseball in 1990: "We have not 
discussed what talent we will use on baseball. But I do not agree with you 
about Brent. Anyone who has heard him do baseball on CBS Radio knows he is very 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Stockton is another of our play-by-play announcers who is experienced on 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Pilson said: "We will have to go after some good commentators, but we do 
not have to chase any play-by-play announcers. We already have them." 
</P>
<P>
Clarifying, Pilson said that does not necessarily mean that Musburger and 
Stockton are shoo-ins. 
</P>
<P>
"I said we wouldn't have to chase any," he said. "That doesn't mean we won't 
talk to those who come to us." 
</P>
<P>
Such as Al Michaels and Vin Scully? 
</P>
<P>
Pilson said he wouldn't speculate on any possibilities. "I'll leave that to you 
newspaper guys," he said. "We have a two-page list of possible commentators. We 
would like to have someone who is around baseball on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
Someone such as ABC's Tim McCarver, a New York Mets announcer? 
</P>
<P>
"He's currently under contract to ABC, so I can't talk about him," Pilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of possibilities, and I wouldn't rule out any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Add Musburger: Obviously, he's interested in the baseball job, even if it means 
giving up some other assignments, such as college football. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware you can't do baseball on a part-time basis," he said. "You can't 
just come in and do a baseball game every once in a while and do a competent 
job. So, yes, I know I would have to give up something." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger did one or two baseball games a month for CBS Radio last season, plus 
the National League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
He would surely do more if he were tabbed the No. 1 man on baseball for the 
television network, which will show only 12 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pilson: "We would have to find a way to keep Brent, or whoever it is, 
around baseball. We know that is very important." 
</P>
<P>
ABC used to bring in Howard Cosell to work baseball on a spot basis, and that 
was a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger's announcing partner at CBS Radio last season was new Hall of Fame 
member Johnny Bench, who figures to be a candidate for one of the CBS-TV 
commentating jobs. Another is New York Yankees announcer Bill White, who also 
works for CBS Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the others candidates: Joe Morgan, Reggie Jackson, Joe Garagiola, Joe 
Torre, Don Sutton, Tom Seaver and Jim Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
A big hit: "Home Run Derby," a series taped in the late 1950s at old Wrigley 
Field in Los Angeles, popped up on ESPN last month, usually running at 12:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The shows had a 2-week run, and because of popular demand, they will be back in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN got the shows from MGM-United Artists and used them as late-night fillers. 
They were on at 3:30 a.m. in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the shows got considerable response, particularly from West Coast 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
The format has two home run hitters square off for a nine-inning contest. 
Sluggers such as Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Harmon Killebrew 
face a pitcher who is rewarded for serving up home run balls. Anything less 
than an over-the-fence home run is an out. 
</P>
<P>
The winner gets $2,000, the loser $1,000. Also, there are bonuses for 3 or more 
consecutive home runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the series of shows last month, Aaron won $12,000. But he lost to Wally 
Post, who in turn lost a thriller to Dick Stuart, who hit 2 homers in the 
bottom of the ninth to win, 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
While one batter is hitting, the host, former Hollywood Stars announcer Mark 
Scott, interviews the other. It's high camp and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the Vin Scully of his time in Los Angeles, died of a heart attack at 45 
in 1960. His widow, Dorothy, lives in Woodland Hills. A daughter, Mary Sherman, 
37, lives in Studio City and a son, Douglas, 35, lives in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was watching ESPN late one night and saw the show and called me 
immediately," Sherman said. "It was wonderful to see Dad back on television." 
</P>
<P>
Oops Dept.: In the second quarter of last Sunday's American Football Conference 
championship game, NBC showed a man in the stands and identified him as 
Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason's father. 
</P>
<P>
One problem. The man was not Norman Esiason. NBC got his seat assignment wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the wrong guy," yelled John Filippelli, producer of the pregame show, 
as he ran into the production truck. 
</P>
<P>
NBC later showed the real Norman Esiason in a seat not far from the other man, 
who after the game was identified by reporters as Bob Reynolds of Hamilton, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said he was unaware of the error until later. "When I got home, my 
brother called and asked to speak to Mr. Esiason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Add AFC game: Paul Maguire, who was working the game for NBC, chose not to 
report details of a scuffle between two Buffalo players, veteran lineman Joe 
Devlin and cornerback Erroll Tucker, in the locker room after the Bills' loss. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire, a former player for the Bills, said he didn't think it was news. 
Funny, CBS and most newspapers treated it as fairly major news. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two Southern California college basketball teams, Loyola Marymount and UCLA, 
will make network appearances Saturday. The Lions' game at DePaul will be on 
CBS at 11 a.m., PST, and the Bruins' home game with Notre Dame will be on NBC 
at 11:30. . . . The announcers for the Loyola game will be Greg Gumbel, brother 
of Bryant, and Quinn Buckner, a former Indiana and Milwaukee Bucks player. Both 
will be making debuts for CBS. . . . The announcers for the UCLA-Notre Dame 
game will be Dick Enberg and Al McGuire. Since Enberg will be working the Super 
Bowl next weekend, NBC offered to give him the day off. But because of his 
affection for the two schools, Enberg asked to work the game. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Weisman, the executive producer for NBC Sports, attending this week's 
press tour in Universal City to talk about next weekend's Super Bowl pregame 
show, said: "Some people say 2 hours is too long for a pregame show. And 
ratings indicate they may be right. We got a 21 rating for our pregame show 3 
years ago, then CBS got an 18, and it dipped to 14 last year when ABC had the 
game. I think what we have to do is come up with more imaginative programming." 
</P>
<P>
One new feature in this year's pregame show will be the Diet Pepsi Talent 
Challenge. Each NFL team was invited to nominate a player or group of players 
with a particular talent. Twenty nominated contestants, and five finalists who 
will appear on the show, are expected to be announced today. The Rams nominated 
wide receiver Michael Young, an accomplished country and western singer. The 
Chicago Bears also nominated a country and western performer, defensive end Dan 
Hampton. The Raiders' entry is a group of players doing a rap video. 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Paris, San Francisco's 300-pound offensive tackle, entered as a poet but 
is not eligible because the 49ers are in the Super Bowl. "He'll be busy 
elsewhere," Weisman said, "so he'll have to forgo reading poetry."

<P>
The Canadiens improved their season record to 6-0-1 against the Bruins with a 
5-3 victory at Boston Thursday night.

<P>
The Houston Rockets needed Akeem Olajuwon's 32 points, including 6 straight 
baskets in the closing minutes, to rally for a 116-106 victory over the 
Portland Trail Blazers Thursday night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"We pull through one way or another," said Olajuwon, who scored 12 points in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pressure time. That's when we like it. I like to change the direction 
when it's not going our way," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon also had 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Woodson scored 22 points for the Rockets. Jerome Kersey and Kevin 
Duckworth scored 23 points each for Portland, and Clyde Drexler scored 22. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 130, Dallas 95 -- Dale Ellis broke a 2-game shooting slump by scoring 
36 points, including 4 3-pointers, as the SuperSonics won their 12th 
consecutive home game. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, who was held to 17 points by Portland and Cleveland in each of his last 
2 games, ignited a 21-5 Seattle run during a 6-minute span in the third quarter 
as Seattle turned a 14-point lead into a 30-point margin, 88-58. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 115, San Antonio 91 -- John Stockton had 26 points, 16 assists and 6 
steals to lead the Jazz past the Spurs at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone scored 31 points and Thurl Bailey added 21, while Mark Eaton had 17 
rebounds and 11 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 106, New Jersey 103 -- Dennis Johnson made a free throw and Danny Ainge 
added 2 more in the final minute for the Celtics at Boston. Reggie Lewis scored 
26 points for the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 106, Miami 100 -- Steve Colter scored 11 points in the fourth 
quarter, and Bernard King and Jeff Malone scored 32 points each as the Bullets 
rallied to beat the Heat at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
New York 106, Charlotte 89 -- -- Charles Oakley scored 6 of his 12 points 
during a 15-0 spurt to open the third quarter as the Knicks made it 12 straight

TRACK AND FIELD / RANDY HARVEY; 
</P>
<P>
SOME NAME ATHLETES TAKING WINTER OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Harvey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winter after the Summer Olympics should be one of the best for indoor track 
and field in the United States because athletes, Americans and foreigners, can 
use their 5-ring box-office appeal to turn gold, silver and bronze into dollars 
and cents. 
</P>
<P>
It is something like a victory tour, paid for by promoters who then can 
advertise that they have a dozen or so Olympic medalists in their meets. 
</P>
<P>
Most promoters, however, will be hard pressed to make such a claim during this 
U.S. indoor season, which begins Saturday night with the Dallas Morning News 
Games. Many of the sport's marquee names have decided to winter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Ben Johnson, of course, has no choice, having been sent to the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation's penalty box for 2 years after 
testing positive for steroid use at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will we see Florence Griffith Joyner or Sergei Bubka. And Carl Lewis, 
so far, has committed to only one U.S. meet, the Houston Chronicle Games in his 
hometown Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Take the money and run? Flojo has done the opposite. She ran and is now taking 
the money. We have a better chance of catching her with Arsenio Hall on the Fox 
Channel than with Evelyn Ashford at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka, the Soviet pole vaulter who recently was named male athlete of the year 
by Track &amp; Field News, apparently has enough VCRs in stock from his 
previous U.S. visits. He won't need to return until he begins dealing in 
compact disc players. He plans to compete only in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewises, Carl and Steve, and their Santa Monica Track Club teammate, Joe 
DeLoach, also will be seen more in Europe than in the United States. A fourth 
member of the club, Danny Everett, probably will run in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. track and field officials should be concerned. If the Santa Monica Track 
Club is starting a trend, U.S. indoor track could go the same way as U.S. 
outdoor track. Overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always put my athletes in U.S. meets," said Joe Douglas, manager of the 
Santa Monica Track Club. "If I had my druthers, they'd be here again this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas said that Europe and Japan offer better tracks and better pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to think of my athletes first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At least for now, though, the U.S. indoor circuit remains the most established, 
and its meets this winter will not be without attractions. 
</P>
<P>
We will see no better high hurdles competition in the world this year than in 
the Sunkist Invitational next Friday night at the Sports Arena, where 2-time 
Olympic champion Roger Kingdom will race 2-time world champion Greg Foster and 
1988 bronze medalist Tonie Campbell. Andre Phillips, who beat Edwin Moses at 
Seoul in the intermediate hurdles, also is entered. 
</P>
<P>
Foster is trying to come back after breaking his arm last summer, an injury 
that prevented him from making the U.S. Olympic team, despite a valiant effort 
at the trials. 
</P>
<P>
Also trying to come back is Mary Decker Slaney, who had a disappointing 
Olympics, finishing eighth in the 1,500 and 10th in the 3,000. She was not even 
the best American in the 3,000 as Villanova's Vicki Huber finished sixth. Two 
other Americans, Kim Gallagher in the 800 and Francie Larrieu-Smith, came close 
at Seoul to breaking two of Slaney's long-standing American records. 
</P>
<P>
Slaney proved that she is not ready for retirement by winning the Fifth Avenue 
Mile after the Olympics. But apparently not everyone was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
After a 14-year relationship with Slaney, Nike officials decided that she no 
longer was worth a 6-figure annual contract and proposed a substantial cut this 
year. She turned that down, then announced Thursday that she does not have a 
shoe sponsor but that she will be competing for the L'eggs Running Club. 
</P>
<P>
So it is important for her to re-establish herself as one of the world's best 
middle-distance runners this winter. She will be tested. Romania's Paula Ivan, 
the Olympic 1,500 champion, and the Soviet Union's Tatiana Samolenko, the 
Olympic 3,000-meter champion, are expected to compete in the United States. 
Samolenko and Slaney may meet in The Los Angeles Times/Eagle Games Feb. 17 at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Morocco's Said Aouita also has something to prove. He entered the Olympics 
boasting that he could win the 800, 1,500 and 5,000. But he settled for third 
in the 800, couldn't make it to the starting line for the semifinals in the 
1,500 because of an injury and didn't enter the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to boast that he is the world's fastest man from the 1,500 through 
the 10,000, although some close to him claim that he has run himself into the 
ground. We will see, perhaps as early at the Feb. 3 Millrose Games at New York, 
where he could meet Kenya's Julius Kariuki, the Olympic steeplechase champion, 
in the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has nothing to prove but will keep 
trying anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the amount that U.S. promoters pay her, it is not enough by half. Yet, 
in the case of the Times/Eagle meet, she waived her fee so that it could be 
donated to a charity benefiting sports programs for needy children in Los 
Angeles. Much of her time, energy and money already go toward a similar program 
that she established in her native East St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee not only is the sport's best athlete but also its best 
ambassador. She may compete in Japan this winter, but she also has commitments 
to 3 U.S. indoor meets, including Saturday's at Dallas, and may enter 3 others. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little doubt that she would rather compete in the long jump, 
her husband-coach, Bob Kersee, wants her to concentrate on the high hurdles. 
This has been on ongoing battle between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to soothe his ego by entering the hurdles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That was before she learned from meet director Will Kern during a luncheon last 
week that the Soviet Union's Galina Chistyakova, the world record-holder in the 
long jump, will compete at the Times/Eagle meet. 
</P>
<P>
When the luncheon ended, Joyner-Kersee pulled Kern aside and said, "Don't count 
me out of the long jump." 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bridgewater, who won the state high school 200-meter championship last 
year for Washington High, is sprinting for Long Beach City College. He has 
entered the 60 meters at the Sunkist meet against a field that includes Houston 
McTear, Nigeria's Chidi Imoh and Roy Martin. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Congress, which governs track and field in the United States, 
will have a third hearing Jan. 18 in San Jose for the U.S. athletes and 
administrators who competed last fall in South Africa. Two previous hearings 
have resulted in indefinite suspensions for 10 athletes and an administrator. 
Among the athletes expected to attend this hearing are Olympians John Powell, 
Carol Cady and Ruth Wysocki. TAC officials say that they will rule on the 
length of the suspensions by the end of this month. . . . TAC named Carl Lewis 
and Florence Griffith Joyner as its athletes of the year for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Great Britain's Sebastian Coe, 2-time Olympic champion in the 1,500, decided 
not to retire after being left off the British team that went to Seoul last 
summer. He will compete in the 800 meters at the European indoor meet next 
month. Another British runner who appeared as if he might be finished with the 
sport, David Moorcroft, is returning to the indoor circuit tonight at Hamilton, 
Canada. He has entered the 3,000 next Friday night at the Sports Arena. 
Moorcroft, a former world record-holder at 5,000 meters, was the subject of a 
touching profile in Bud Greenspan's film after the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Several track athletes are among the Olympians expected to attend a U.S. 
Olympic Committee career-counseling seminar Saturday at the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation in Los Angeles to discuss their lives after sports. . . . Mike Tully 
has recovered from Achilles tendon surgery and will compete Saturday at 
Barcelona in a meet for pole vaulters only. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the first Canadian indoor meet of the winter a week ago at 
Saskatoon were a little shortsighted. After remarkable times were recorded in 
the 1,500 and the 800, they decided to measure the track. They discovered that 
it wasn't long enough. . . . When Primo Nebiolo resigned under pressure as the 
president of the Italian track and field federation, speculation was that he 
also would step down as president of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation. But he denies it. He said he was forced out in Italy because of 
politics, not because of alleged corruption within the federation.

ROB AN PLUNDER'S 7-RACE STREAK IS MISLEADING 
</P>

<P>
When a 2-year-old wins 7 straight races, there's usually a coast-to-coast 
clamor about his prospects as a Kentucky Derby candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Rob an Plunder, a high-strung colt, began winning in a maiden race at Hollywood 
Park last July and hasn't lost since, but his streak has made nary a ripple, in 
California or elsewhere. In the recent Eclipse Awards voting, he wasn't even 
considered. In Las Vegas, you can get 40-1 odds on Rob an Plunder to win the 
Kentucky Derby. There are about 2 dozen horses with shorter prices in the 
future book. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Rob an Plunder will be favored Sunday in the $300,000 El Camino 
Real Derby at Bay Meadows is that undefeated King Glorious, California's 
pre-eminent Kentucky Derby prospect and currently 10-1 in Las Vegas, is on the 
sidelines with a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
Had King Glorious been ready to run Sunday, Rob an Plunder's trainer, Jim 
Benedict, would have skipped the El Camino Real and run in a stake for 
California-breds at Santa Anita last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Rob an Plunder's winning streak, which includes 6 stakes races, has been put 
together for the most part against third-rate opposition. The only significant 
race on the list was the Balboa at Del Mar in August. And that day, Bruho was 
the best horse, but he zig-zagged at the top of the stretch and dumped his 
rider, Gary Stevens, enabling Rob an Plunder to romp home. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Rob an Plunder's wins, at Bay Meadows, was the result of Big 
Conviction's disqualification for interference. Big Conviction had finished 
first by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
Since Rob an Plunder cost only $6,000 as a yearling and has earned $224,800, 
his owners know they have a bargain, but they are not deluding themselves about 
their horse being in King Glorious' class. The second and last time Rob an 
Plunder lost, at Golden Gate Fields in June, he finished 10 lengths behind King 
Glorious. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the strategy for Rob an Plunder has been simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike your daughter, you want your horse to keep the worst possible company," 
is the way Don Eidson, one of the colt's owners, explains it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Rob an Plunder, the small field for the El Camino Real Derby is also 
expected to include Hawkster and Stephen's Sooner, who couldn't beat King 
Glorious in the Hollywood Futurity last month. Other probables are Double 
Quick, Base Camp and Harmony Creek, who will run only if the track is dry. This 
is unlikely, since Bay Meadows has been muddy and more rain is forecast for the 
Bay Area for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly, the filly who has been unsuccessful in 4 starts since winning 
the Del Mar Debutante in September and then being disqualified for 
interference, has an outside chance to run, but she probably will go instead in 
the $100,000 Bay Meadows Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
All the early 3-year-old racing in Florida has proved is that there's no 
apparent quality in depth behind Easy Goer, the champion 2-year-colt for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Big Stanley, the winner of Sunday's Tropical Park Derby, has won 4 of his last 
5 starts, but all of his races have been run at Calder, where the top horses 
seldom run. 
</P>
<P>
Winners Laugh, who ran second twice to Easy Goer last fall, and Mercedes Won, 
who won the Sanford and Hopeful at Saratoga in August, were both beaten by 
Halrose, a lightly regarded Canadian import, on opening day at Gulfstream Park 
last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, who hasn't run since finishing second to Is It True in the Breeders' 
Cup, isn't likely to run in the Florida Derby at Gulfstream on March 4, but 
will probably race in the Swale, a 7-furlong race there the same day. After 
that, Easy Goer is expected to take a New York route to the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, the 9-year-old gelding who has run only 34 times because of 
physical problems, will make his first start since finishing third in last 
year's Santa Anita Handicap when he runs Saturday in the $100,000 San Carlos 
Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, who has earned $1.3 million with 15 wins, has been assigned 123 
pounds. The high weight at 126 pounds in the 7-furlong San Carlos is On the 
Line, who has won 3 straight since an ankle crack was repaired with a pin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday at Santa Anita, a large field will run in the $200,000, 1 1/8-mile 
San Fernando, which is the second leg of the Strub series for 4-year-olds and 
the first major stake at the track this season. Among the starters is Oraibi, 
who won the Malibu, the first race in the threesome that concludes with the 
Strub on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Very Subtle, a possibility for the $100,000 Santa Monica Handicap on Monday at 
Santa Anita, has earned $1.5 million, more than any filly or mare in training. 
Lady's Secret holds the filly-mare record for earnings with $3 million. . . . 
Although Alex Solis has been suspended 5 days by the Santa Anita stewards, 
through Sunday, he will be able to ride in the weekend stakes at Bay Meadows 
because of California's designated-race rule. Solis has calls on Bright Asset 
in the Bay Meadows Oaks Saturday and on Double Quick in the El Camino Real 
Derby Sunday. Last month, under similar circumstances, Solis rode Stocks Up to 
victory in the Hollywood Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, who won last year's El Camino Real, is now in the hands of trainer 
Charlie Whittingham. Jerry Moss, who owns Ruhlmann, has transferred most of his 
horses from Bobby Frankel to other trainers. Frankel gave no explanation for 
losing the horses. On the incoming side of the ledger, Frankel is now training 
Saratoga Passage, who as a 2-year-old won the Norfolk in 1987 and then 
developed physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was out of action for a few months last year with a broken wrist, 
Fernando Valenzuela, California's top apprentice, will be able to ride with a 
5-pound allowance through April 21. . . . The decision isn't due until 
February, but the Del Mar Turf Club is expected to receive a 20-year renewal, 
over 2 competing bids, to run racing at the Del Mar track. . . . In total votes 
for the Eclipse Award, Jose Santos received 105 to Chris McCarron's 88 1/2, 
with 25 1/2 votes going to other jockeys. In the total that counted, Santos was 
favored by 2 of the 3 voting groups, with the Daily Racing Racing Form giving 
him the biggest edge over McCarron, 42-27. Turf reporters and track racing 
secretaries also voted.

GRAYING BABY BOOMERS AND STRONG RATINGS ARE ENOUGH TO KEEP KJOI WHERE IT'S BEEN 
ALL ALONG -- IN THE EASY CHAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On his first working visit to his newly acquired KJOI-FM, Carl Brazell was 
absolutely certain about one thing: It would not depart from the "easy 
listening" format that has put it in the top ranks of more than 40 commercial 
radio stations in the Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
In the recently announced Arbitron ratings for fall, the station climbed to 
fifth from seventh place last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great way to start the new year and ownership," Brazell said. 
</P>
<P>
And doubtless it was one that made him -- and his bankers -- feel vindicated in 
the $79-million purchase, which was a record high price in the United States 
for an FM-only station. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for optimism is that Los Angeles is "by far" the country's 
hottest market in spending on radio advertising -- about $340 million in 1988, 
he said. That figure is 15% above the previous year, or double the 7.4% growth 
rate for the industry nationally. Los Angeles is forecast to see a 7.5% 
increase this year, compared to 7.8% for the industry nationally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also encouraging KJOI for the long run, as Brazell sees it, are the 
demographics: The gradual graying of the baby boomers seems to convert a goodly 
share of them into easy listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"KJOI is one of those wonderful stations that has a franchise in the 
marketplace," he enthused. "It is the only easy listening station in the Los 
Angeles area, and there is strong recognition for its dial position and call 
letters." (KJOI, at 98.7 on the dial, specializes in playing the sort of 
soothing music that critics love to hate but many listeners obviously like.) 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Brazell started a life's work in radio while still in high 
school, working as a newscaster for a tiny station in Louisiana's Cajun 
country. He had to take a crash course in French from a tutor for the bilingual 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Brazell spent much of his career working for Metromedia Inc.'s radio division 
and became its president in 1982, then led a leveraged buyout of the radio 
properties from owner John W. Kluge and renamed them Metropolitan Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Road 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he was a news anchor for a year at KLAC in Los Angeles in 1969. 
More recently, as head of Metropolitan, he had his finger in the Los Angeles 
market again, supervising KLAC and KMET, which two years ago was changed to 
KTWV-FM and nicknamed "the Wave." 
</P>
<P>
So Brazell has traveled a long road to become, following a complicated series 
of transactions worth $160 million, the major owner last year of a string of 
five broadcasting properties -- including KJOI, with the others in Dallas and 
Denver -- under the umbrella of New York-based Command Communications. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction was accomplished with financing from three banks and part 
ownership by Robert F. X. Sillerman, an investor in broadcasting companies. 
Among other things, KJOI's former owner, Legacy Broadcasting, acquired control 
of Metropolitan. Sillerman is an investor in Metropolitan as well as in 
Brazell's firm. 
</P>
<P>
One of Brazell's properties is Texas State Networks, which broadcasts regional 
and agricultural news and carries Dallas Cowboys games to 200 stations in 13 
states -- in both English and Spanish languages. The company also operates a 
Spanish-language news network that reaches 75% of the Spanish-speaking 
population of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish broadcasting, Brazell added, had $490 million in revenue in 1987 and is 
expected to see a 25% annual growth in advertising for the next five years, 
making it "an incredible area of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
As for KJOI, Brazell anticipates changes only in refining the selection of 
music and in a more aggressive marketing strategy. Also, he said, the station 
needs "a little more research in the marketplace" to enable it to reflect the 
changing tastes of the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
But, no matter how it is sliced, he maintains it still be easy listening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A.'S MOST POPULAR RADIO STATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron rated KJOI fifth in the Los Angeles market during the fall. Ratings 
reflect the percentage of the listening audience over 12 years old who tuned in 
during a given 15-minute period.

DEFENSE TO REMAIN FOCUS AT ENERGY DEPT.; 
</P>
<P>
CHOICE OF WATKINS POINTS UP SHIFT FROM CIVILIAN TO MILITARY TASKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Even if there were no crisis at the nation's nuclear weapons factories, the 
choice of Navy Adm. James D. Watkins -- a military man with nuclear experience 
-- to head the Energy Department squares with the transformation of the agency 
under President Reagan into a mostly military one. 
</P>
<P>
Created as a cabinet agency by President Jimmy Carter in 1977, the department 
had among its bureaucratic predecessors the Atomic Energy Commission. As such, 
it became responsible for the design, testing and production of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the impetus for a cabinet-level Energy Department was the Arab oil 
embargo of 1973, and the new agency became home to myriad civilian energy 
programs aimed at fostering conservation and production to limit the nation's 
vulnerability to further oil shocks. 
</P>
<P>
Such projects -- including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, now a 
550-million-barrel federal oil stockpile, and the ill-fated Synthetic Fuels 
Corp., intended to develop an alternative fuels industry -- quickly came to 
dominate the fledgling agency. Measured in real 1982 dollars, defense-related 
spending accounted for just a fourth of a $14-billion Energy Department budget 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
When the cost-conscious Reagan moved to Washington, he pledged to abolish the 
agency. But then came "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative, a surge in defense 
outlays at the department more than offset steep cutbacks in civilian programs. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the department once slated for extinction weathered the Reagan 
cost-cutting onslaught better than many agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Research Service found that defense spending at the Energy 
Department leaped by an inflation-adjusted 81% between 1979 and 1987, while 
spending on all other energy programs plummeted 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Even commercial programs for nuclear power suffered, a General Accounting 
Office study said. The 1987 budget, for example, shifted programs in advanced 
nuclear reactors for commercial use "to meeting the space and terrestrial power 
needs for the military." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decline in world oil prices that began about the time Reagan 
entered the White House, combined with rising domestic oil production, 
diminished the urgency with which many of the Energy Department's civilian 
projects had been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Risk, Big Payoff 
</P>
<P>
Programs to foster solar, wind and other so-called renewable forms of energy 
were abolished, while tax incentives and other measures to encourage energy 
conservation were dismantled. Even mainstream research and development into 
such fields as the enhanced recovery of oil from old fields was cut sharply. 
</P>
<P>
The non-military spending that survived was redirected toward what the 
government called long-term, high-risk, high-payoff research into such areas as 
nuclear fusion and superconductivity. An exception was increased spending on 
technology to burn coal more cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 60% of the Energy Department's spending goes toward 
defense-related projects, including the plants around the nation that produce 
tritium, plutonium and other components of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Massive safety problems uncovered at these plants and related facilities stand 
to occupy much of the Energy Department's time and money for years. If only for 
that reason, the military dominance of the agency is liable to grow under the 
incoming Bush Administration, not decline. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for this horrendous cleanup we're facing, I would have said 
that Bush would have started swinging the civilian-defense split back toward 
50-50," said one manager in the Energy Department. "But between the budget 
deficit and the weapons problem, I don't see how that is possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Military Focus 
</P>
<P>
A Senate committee has estimated that the cleanup of some 155 contamination 
problems at government weapons facilities could cost $5 billion a year for 
three decades. That alone would swallow up nearly half of the current Energy 
budget. A Reagan Administration report acknowledged Thursday that four plants 
probably will have to be closed permanently and the rest will require at least 
$81 billion in repairs and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Philip K. Verleger Jr., energy economist at the Institute for International 
Economics in Washington and a Carter Administration economist, argued that the 
military focus at the agency extends beyond funding and affects the way the 
department thinks about other energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
He cites as an example the department's emergency planning office, supervised 
by an ex-military officer, for focusing on such issues as terrorism at the 
expense of more mundane needs, including the improved flow of information about 
oil movements around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But Verleger, echoing frequent criticisms of some of the early civilian energy 
programs, said the evolving defense dominance of the Energy Department budget 
isn't bad in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that going to two-thirds defense spending is a mistake implies that a 
lot of those energy expenditures that have been cut were well justified in the 
first place," he said. "They were not."

Bhopal District Judge M. W. Deo who was hearing the case for compensation to 
victims of the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal, India, has been taken off the case, 
officials said. The state High Court ruled in November that Deo was prejudiced 
after Union Carbide Corp. complained that he ordered it to pay interim relief 
of $290 million to victims before fixing liability for the leak. Deo was 
transferred to a trial court at Mandleshwar in Madhya Pradesh state. Nirmal K. 
Jain, another district judge, has been appointed to hear the case in Bhopal.

Chemical Banking Corp., one of the nation's largest banking companies, on 
Thursday reported a 26% jump in its fourth-quarter profit and record earnings 
for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The firm cited a decrease in its provision for loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 totaled $288.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
For all 1988, its profit totaled a record $753.6 million, contrasted with a 
year-ago loss of $853.7 million. The 1988 results also included full-year 
earnings from Texas Commerce Bancshares, which earned $2.1 million last year, 
versus 1987's $120.3-million loss.

Ogilvy Group has adopted a "poison pill" anti-takeover plan, which would make a 
takeover prohibitively expensive. The move caused shares of Ogilvy, the 
sixth-largest U.S. advertising agency, to drop $1.25 to $31.25 on the NASDAQ 
market after it announced that its board passed the plan at a special meeting. 
Ogilvy stock had risen sharply in recent days on takeover talk. But the New 
York company, whose main subsidiary is Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, said it 
knew of no suitors.

A $600,000 stretch Lincoln limousine was delivered to President Reagan on 
Thursday but will be used for the first time by President-elect George Bush on 
Inauguration Day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-foot black armored presidential limousine was built from the ground up 
under Secret Service specifications during the past three years, said Jerald F. 
terHorst, Ford's director of national public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Roberts, vice president and general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury 
division of Ford Motor Co., made the presentation to Reagan in Bush's presence. 
"It's mine for a few days George, then it will be yours," Reagan told Bush. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a presidential limousine has been custom-built. Others 
have been transformed to meet White House needs. 
</P>
<P>
TerHorst, who was White House spokesman for former President Gerald Ford, said 
he expected that Bush would use the limousine when he goes to the White House 
Jan. 20 to pick up President Reagan. They will ride down Pennsylvania Avenue 
together to the Capitol. Bush and his wife, Barbara, will also ride in the 
Lincoln to start the inaugural parade. 
</P>
<P>
The new White House limousine "has all the latest communications gear that a 
president could possibly want," TerHorst said. It seats three persons in the 
rear and has three jump seats. The vehicle's interior is dark blue and adorned 
with the presidential seal inside and outside. 
</P>
<P>
The last Lincoln presidential limousine was used from 1972 to 1982. The White 
House since has leased Cadillacs from General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ford has leased its limousines to the White House but the federal 
government purchased the new model for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential limousine is always used on overseas presidential trips. It is 
expected to be flown to Japan for use by Bush when he attends the Feb. 24 
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.

Pittsburgh-based Allegheny International announced plans to cancel a merger 
agreement with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a New York securities firm, in 
favor of a deal to sell its core Oster-Sunbeam division to Towson, Md.-based 
Black &amp; Decker Corp. for $260 million. The proposed sale is the centerpiece 
of an independent plan of reorganization that management intends to present in 
bankruptcy court, where creditors had backed the proposal from the securities 
firm. The Oster-Sunbeam division makes a range of small household appliances, 
including shavers, mixers and other kitchen appliances.

NAACP SUING N.Y. TIMES OVER PORTRAYAL OF HOME BUYERS IN ADS

The NAACP filed suit Thursday against the New York Times, charging the 
newspaper with publishing real estate advertisements that almost always portray 
whites as potential buyers, in violation of civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said almost exclusive use 
of white models in pictorial real estate ads indicated a preference for white 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
It asked the court to declare the Times in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 
1968, the Civil Rights Act and the Constitution and order the Times to take 
"affirmative steps" to change its practice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paper Denies Charges 
</P>
<P>
The suit also sought unspecified punitive and compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
"These advertisements have a very negative effect on minority home seekers and 
on the housing market in general," said Benjamin Hooks, executive director of 
the civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Decades ago, homeowners would hang up signs or run ads that said, 'Whites 
Only.' The fair housing laws were designed to change all that. But now, 
developers run ads that say with pictures what they can no longer say in words. 
Either way, the result is the same and it's wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Times denied the charges and said the complaint appeared to 
be "without merit." 
</P>
<P>
"The New York Times has always conformed to all applicable laws concerning 
discrimination and historically has led the way toward the removal of racial 
barriers," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase "equal opportunity housing" or similar words recommended by federal 
regulations are required in all real estate display ads it runs, the newspaper 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charged that in the 20 years since passage of the Fair Housing Act, 
the Times has published display ads "featuring thousands of human models, of 
whom virtually none are black."

DREXEL TALKING WITH FORMER SEC CHAIRMEN ABOUT 2 TOP POSITIONS 
</P>

<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., continuing the search for a prestigious new 
chairman to improve the firm's tarnished reputation, said it is holding talks 
with John S. R. Shad, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Shad, 65, left the SEC in 1987 and is the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. 
He is also a former vice chairman of E. F. Hutton &amp; Co., a brokerage that 
is now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also said it is holding talks with another former SEC chairman, Roderick 
M. Hills, 51, about serving on Drexel's board. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said both men are leaning toward accepting the positions provided that 
Drexel successfully completes its settlement talks with the SEC and the U.S. 
attorney's office in New York. The firm recently announced plans to settle 
expected criminal charges related to securities law violations by pleading 
guilty to six felony counts and paying a record $650 million in financial 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is also negotiating with the SEC on settling civil charges of market 
manipulation, defrauding customers and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Resentments 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said Frederick H. Joseph was expected to continue as Drexel's chief 
executive. Shad had given Joseph one of his first jobs on Wall Street when he 
hired him at Hutton in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Joseph visited the firm's Beverly Hills offices Thursday in an 
attempt to answer questions and quell employee resentments stemming from the 
firm's decision to plead guilty to securities violations. Many traders in the 
highly profitable "junk bond" department in Beverly Hills are unhappy with the 
decision and are mounting a campaign, including T-shirts and newspaper 
advertisements, rallying support for embattled junk bond chief Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph told employees Thursday that the firm expects Milken to be indicted next 
week on securities charges, one source said. Milken's ability to defend himself 
has been hurt by Drexel's guilty plea, traders say. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Drexel said the firm's objective in approaching Shad 
and Hills "is to develop a fresh outlook on the problems and opportunities it 
faces, and to continue to make an important contribution to the nation's 
capital markets." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the talks with Shad came just a day after Drexel said it had called off 
discussions with former White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr. about 
the chairmanship. Drexel earlier had said that the talks were ended by mutual 
consent after Baker and the firm failed to agree on terms. A Drexel spokesman 
denied Thursday that the offer to Baker had been withdrawn because the firm had 
already decided on Shad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a telephone call Thursday to the U.S. embassy in The Hague, Shad 
couldn't be reached for comment. An embassy press attache, Leonardo Williams, 
confirmed that Shad had been approached by Drexel about becoming chairman. 
Williams declined to answer questions about the talks. 
</P>
<P>
As SEC chairman from 1981 to 1987, Shad overcame public doubts that a man with 
a Wall Street background could be tough on violators of securities laws. 
Although the actual work was done by the staff of the SEC's enforcement 
division, Shad presided over the SEC during an era when it launched its biggest 
investigations ever, including the one that led to the filing last September of 
a massive civil complaint against Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Shad is said to have significant personal wealth, and last year he contributed 
more than $20 million to Harvard Business School to found a program on business 
ethics and leadership. A Drexel official said it was understood that Shad would 
contribute a major part of any earnings he received from the firm "to 
charitable purposes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent Directors 
</P>
<P>
One source said a Drexel settlement with the SEC would almost certainly include 
a provision requiring the firm to take on independent directors and establish 
an "audit committee" of the board to monitor the firm's affairs. The source 
said the appointment of Shad and Hills would be in keeping with such a 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone, Hills confirmed that he had been approached by Drexel. He is 
chairman of Washington-based Manchester Group Ltd., a merchant banking concern, 
and served as SEC chairman from 1975 to 1977. Hills, however, refused to 
discuss the status of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
If he is named Drexel's chairman, Shad would replace Robert E. Linton, who for 
some time has expressed a desire to retire to his ranch in New Mexico.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: OWNERS MUST FACE NEW WORKPLACE CONCERNS

Providing affordable health insurance benefits, creating a drug-free workplace 
and coping with proposed workers' compensation reforms top the list of 
frustrations that will face small business owners in 1989, according to small 
business advisers and advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Small business owners may think they're too busy running their companies to 
worry much about drugs, insurance and taxes. But the experts say that new 
legislation and changing economics will force them to confront these concerns 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20% increase in health insurance costs has sent many small 
business owners searching for ways to provide adequate coverage for their 
employees, according to Lou Custrini, spokesman for the Merchants &amp; 
Manufacturers Assn. in Los Angeles. The organization represents about 3,500 
California employers with an average of 200 employees each. 
</P>
<P>
Custrini said many small employers who can't find more affordable insurance 
plans are requiring that employees pay a larger share of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the association's members are also concerned about recently defeated, 
but far from dead, national and state legislation that could require small 
companies to provide unpaid parental, adoption and maternity leaves, as well as 
leaves for employees to care for sick family members. 
</P>
<P>
Many small businesses, in fact, provide some of these benefits, he said, but 
members oppose the government requiring them. Legislation dealing with mandated 
leaves was defeated at both the state and federal levels last year but is back 
on several elected officials' agendas in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Another major issue is an outgrowth of the Reagan Administration's war on 
illegal drugs. Beginning in March, new federal regulations require that any 
company holding a federal government contract provide a "drug-free workplace," 
according to Susan Walthall, spokeswoman for the Small Business 
Administration's advocacy office. 
</P>
<P>
The law is complex, but it includes requirements that companies issue policies 
prohibiting drug use on the job and provide rehabilitation programs for 
employees who request help with their drug problems. The measure also includes 
penalties that may be levied against a company if its employees are convicted 
of drug offenses, Walthall said. 
</P>
<P>
Another new federal law may be of interest to women who own small businesses, 
Walthall said. Beginning in June, the federal government will provide $10 
million in matching grants for organizations providing technical assistance and 
management training for women who own businesses. She said the details are 
being worked out. (The Small Business Administration's advocacy office tracks 
legislation and offers a toll-free number to answer questions about federal 
issues: 1-800-368-5855.) 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Martyn Hopper, executive director of the National Federation of 
Independent Business, said he is monitoring moves to revamp the state's 
$7-billion workers' compensation insurance system. Negotiations between 
representatives of organized labor, employers, insurance companies, trial 
attorneys and physicians broke down last summer but are expected to resume 
sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
"California employers pay some of the highest benefits costs in the nation, yet 
the workers receive some of the lowest payments," Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the five divergent groups are trying to work out a "politically 
acceptable" solution to the high administrative costs and what he considers the 
excessive amounts paid to doctors and lawyers involved in the system.

The NFIB, which represents thousands of small business owners across the 
country and hires lobbyists in Sacramento and Washington, is seeking a law in 
California that would allow pension funds to lend money to small businesses. 
Hopper said similar laws exist in 22 states. If NFIB's efforts are successful, 
about $2 million in pension funds could be released for small business 
expansion loans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Small business owners may also want to consider a few ways to reduce their 1989 
taxes. Ronald Silver, director of Arthur Young's entrepreneurial services 
division in Century City, suggests talking with your accountant about a few 
areas of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said small, closely held companies who meet all the requirements have 
until March 15 to change their tax status to Subchapter S. If they qualify, he 
said, it means they would be taxed at a lower rate as a proprietorship rather 
than as a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to file one form with the state and one with the federal government," 
Silver said. "If you are a profitable company, there can be significant 
savings." He said one company that switched saved $6 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Silver also suggests that small business owners faced with rising benefit costs 
consider offering employees what is known as a "cafeteria" plan of different 
benefits to choose from. These individually tailored plans are often more 
cost-effective. They can also boost employee morale by giving the employee 
freedom to chose the benefits he or she needs most, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now is also the best time to set up new methods to separate travel and 
entertainment expenses, Silver said. He reminds small business owners that 
while travel and lodging expenses are 100% deductible, meals and entertainment 
expenses are only 80% deductible. He said many small businesses lose money by 
not keeping track of expenses properly because "they just haven't thought about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Business Plan Seminar 
</P>
<P>
"Developing a Business Plan" is the subject of a three-hour seminar scheduled 
next Tuesday, at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. Ben Pelter, former 
president of a national printing and publishing company, will lead the 
discussion from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The fee is $10. For information call: 
213-894-3016. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs to Meet 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford Entrepreneurial Forum and Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. are hosting 
a small business program next Thursday. This "venture forum" is designed to 
bring together entrepreneurs to discuss common problems, and Thursday's program 
will include a presentation by Cybermation Inc., a firm that makes 
computer-driven sound editing systems for feature films. The event begins at 
5:30 p.m. at Peat Marwick's offices, 27th floor, CitiCorp Plaza, 727 S. 
Figueroa St. in downtown Los Angeles. There is a $10 fee. For reservations, 
call: 213-955-8840.

CLOTHES TRANSFORM IMAGE OF A WOMAN CLIMBING UP THE CORPORATE LADDER

The upwardly mobile look doesn't come easily. Or inexpensively. But it can pay 
off, as it did for Tess, the lead character in "Working Girl." She's the 
"Rocky" of the secretarial set, a woman who fights her way up from messy to 
marvelous by restyling her hair, dumping her makeup and wearing her boss's 
aggressively elegant, high-ticket clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Could it happen in real life? Probably so. A former secretary exited a recent 
screening of the film with one wrist held high, Rocky-like, cheering: "She did 
it, she did it; she's just like me." 
</P>
<P>
The ex-secretary says she was able to change her professional caste and 
transform her image by "studying and imitating everything I could, including 
upper-echelon style." Her hair is short, her clothes modern and precisely cut. 
She usually shops at Bullock's Pasadena store -- "but only during sales, and 
only for well-made items I can keep forever." She will not let her name be used 
here because she now holds managerial rank in the local office of an upscale 
national magazine, where she says everyone assumes she was born authoritative 
-- and chic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sacrifices Are Required 
</P>
<P>
Of course, hardly anyone ever is. 
</P>
<P>
And hardly anyone, boss or assistant, can easily afford a closetful of outfits 
by Giorgio Armani, Sonia Rykiel, Chanel and Calvin Klein. Most working women 
can't even afford a wardrobe of good, lower-price copies. However, sacrifices 
are required for success -- and buying good clothes may be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Presented here and on Page 4 are a few "originals" by designers whose clothes 
were worn in the film, and some good-looking alternatives at somewhat lesser 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Women who know what they're looking for can find even bigger bargains if they 
wait for end-of-season sales and then splurge on the best-looking outfits they 
can afford. Suits like these do not go out of style from year to year; like 
wine, the best improve with age. Some even become "collectors' items." 
</P>
<P>
But some women simply aren't knowledgeable about style. They don't know what to 
look for, no matter how much money they are able to spend. For them, an 
educational afternoon in a retail store, trying on such top designer labels as 
Calvin Klein, Armani, Rykiel and Chanel, might be illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
The best designers, via the clean shaping of suit jackets and the subtle 
mobility of skirts, can convey an air of authority on even the most 
unauthoritative type. And, fortunately, very expensive clothes are usually 
imitated by dozens of manufacturers who produce them at a price level that the 
masses can afford.

FIRST PERSON: IN AN AIRPORT TAXI, FEAR AND SUSPICION RIDE ALONG WITH THE DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REICH, Reich lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was late on a Wednesday night and there were two men sitting in my back seat 
in the dark as I drove north on La Brea. I had worried when I picked them up. 
Two young males. Late night. Flagging a cab on the corner of San Vicente and La 
Brea. Factors that normally constitute a red flag in my book. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker was their destination: round trip to 6th and Alvarado. A drug run 
nine times out of 10. But I had already let them in and we were on our way. I 
needed one more fare to make my night, and, well, sometimes I do get too 
suspicious for my own good. 
</P>
<P>
I am the night driver of United Independent cab No. 110. I got into the above 
situation about 1 1/2 years ago after driving a cab in Los Angeles for three 
years. Luckily my worst fears did not come true as I drove these passengers to 
the drug-infested area east of Alvarado and back to a motel across the street 
from where I picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
Like most cab drivers and their families, my wife and I took the news hard 
about Ami Fhima, the 31-year-old cab driver murdered in Inglewood on Saturday 
night after picking up two men at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Few cab drivers I know have escaped the terrifying feeling of some stranger 
sitting behind you in the dark. I didn't know Ami Fhima, but I can imagine what 
happened at the taxi stand at the airport where he waited for his fare. I've 
worked the airport frequently and am all too familiar with the system there. 
Just like Ami, I was forced to make a decision one time about two 
suspicious-looking passengers at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Every evening before I hit the streets of Los Angeles, I pray: God, keep me 
safe. Bless me with long fares. Allow me to remain kind and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
And before I turn on the dispatch radio I add a final request: 
</P>
<P>
God, grant me the peace of mind to deal with whatever comes up. 
</P>
<P>
Before I drove cab No. 110, I drove another United Independent cab with a 
bulletproof partition separating me from my passengers. But it cut down on most 
conversation. Instead of using it, I try to be discriminating about who I pick 
up. I suppose I lose a hefty portion of profits, but I'd rather remain in 
control than take the chance. Besides, I get plenty of flakes, abusive drunks, 
hotheads and others who slip by my defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Once a young drunk man whose friend put him in my cab in Marina del Rey took a 
slow roundhouse punch at me (and missed) because I had told him to put his 
hands back from over the seat. 
</P>
<P>
I was waiting in line one night at the Century Plaza Hotel cab stand, expecting 
the normal polite guest going to a local restaurant. The doorman whistled. Up 
jaunted a young man in a white T-shirt and worn blue jeans with a huge tatoo on 
his forearm. He was going to Cahuenga and Yucca. Jimmy was his name. Without 
much prompting, he told me in his Ohio twang how a young businesswoman drove up 
to his spot on Santa Monica Boulevard, leaned out the window and called him 
over. Jimmy wiggled his finger, showing me exactly how she did it. "You want 
some pocket change," Jimmy quoted her. Four hundred dollars, it turned out, he 
said, including his return fare. 
</P>
<P>
We drove to an old apartment building off Cahuenga and Yucca. He ducked in for 
a minute. Then we drove back along Santa Monica Boulevard. He told me he 
stashed his belongings near this spot before he jumped in with the woman. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped about Genessee. "Turn off your lights," he said. I turned off the 
lights. He picked up something in the space between two buildings. It was not 
an overnight bag or knapsack as I expected. He admitted that he'd retrieved his 
"dart" -- a hypodermic needle. 
</P>
<P>
To be truthful, I don't have a lot of cab stories. I pick people up, and the 
next minute they're gone, vanished into the changing cityscape. I'm the 
chauffeur for the older couple in formal wear leaving the Shubert to return 
across the street to the Century Plaza. I'm the go-between for the feuding 
couple recently separated when she sends his clothes and other belongings back 
to him via yours truly. Much of the time I am the social worker for the widowed 
old ladies of Fairfax Avenue returning from the supermarkets or doctors' 
offices with taxi coupons. (The elderly are provided with $24 in taxi subsidies 
a month.) I am the driver for a lonely prime-time television soap producer who 
hops from one South Bay club to the next on Friday nights as I wait outside 
with the meter running. 
</P>
<P>
Because I ply the relatively safe areas of town, I'm not too concerned about 
ill-intentioned individuals, although I come in contact with them from time to 
time. Cab driving has brought me face-to-face with my prejudices, which are in 
essence fears, and good for absolutely nothing. Flaky and harmful people cross 
all economic strata and racial lines. Instead of relying on prejudices, I've 
tried to develop and respect instincts for disturbed people and mental cases. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes my instincts will be wrong, or what I think are my instincts are 
actually prejudices. Many times I refuse a fare or pass by people on the street 
flagging me down. I'll never know how many of them were decent and honest 
people. But as one of the weekend dispatchers says, "If it don't feel right, 
don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Deep Breath 
</P>
<P>
No matter what, whenever I get flagged down, I make sure my doors and windows 
are locked, take a deep breath, and check it out. 
</P>
<P>
The airport is a little different. The city's Department of Transportation and 
the management company it contracts to enforce its rules there both want to let 
us know that they are the bosses. I don't quarrel with their need to manage the 
cabs at the airport. LAX has long been a nasty place to pick up a cab, 
especially for passengers going only a short distance. Cab drivers used to come 
to fists over long fares. In this respect, the DOT has cleaned things up. 
</P>
<P>
The cab drivers wait in the holding lot about an hour or more until they are 
dispatched to a designated stand among 10 different locations by the baggage 
areas around the U-shaped lower arrival level. The drivers are received at each 
stand by a starter in uniform who is employed by the contracted company, 
Airport Taxi Management. The starter ushers the passengers as they arrive from 
the baggage area into the next cab in line. 
</P>
<P>
I can imagine Ami Fhima waiting there at the United Airlines stand. I've done 
it myself a hundred times. One time I was waiting there, hoping for a good 
fare, something that would make my long wait worthwhile. But I know I've got to 
swallow the short ones as well. The starter is used to complaints and hip to 
tricks by disgruntled drivers. 
</P>
<P>
So I was sitting there waiting in my cab and the cab in front pulled off with 
three Japanese men in suits, probably going downtown to the New Otani Hotel or 
the Hilton. And now I was next in line. Two young men approached wearing tennis 
shoes and jogging suits. I noticed they were not carrying any luggage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gap in Thinking 
</P>
<P>
The starter handed the dispatch ticket that describes the airport surcharge and 
average rates to one of the men. My eyes met the starter's. He knew what I was 
thinking. Well, sort of. And I knew what he was thinking -- that I'd better not 
make a fuss. Or maybe he was thinking, "good luck." There was a definite gap 
between my thinking and his. 
</P>
<P>
One gap is the sanctity of the cab driver's right to refuse a fare, no matter 
what the DOT says. Neither the starter, nor ATM, nor the DOT nor their 
commissioners work the streets and have to drive my cab with two strangers in 
the back seat in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know exactly what Ami was thinking or how close his experience was to 
mine. But I do know that he had a choice. He could have refused to take those 
two strange men. No cab driver I know wouldn't get suspicious of two men going 
to Inglewood from the airport without luggage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid the Consequences 
</P>
<P>
In my case, I refused. The consequences? I was immediately taken out of line 
and required to wait until an Airport Taxi Management supervisor arrived. He 
listened to our stories. And then he wrote me up for refusing to pick up 
passengers. I lost my place in line, which amounted to about three hours of my 
shift shot. And I was required to appear at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing several weeks later I was admonished by another ATM supervisor 
and told in the manner of a father scolding his son to admit my wrong and the 
matter would be dropped. I held to the cab driver's right of refusal. I was 
told the matter would be handed over to the DOT, but it was lost and forgotten 
forever somewhere in the recesses of the inner sanctum of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
I don't have answers for changes at the airport to help protect the cab driver. 
All I can say is that I'm very sad. My heart reaches out for Ami Fhima and his 
family. But also for all the cab drivers who have to make a choice and size up 
people based on feelings, feelings affected by the things some people do to 
others, like what they did to Ami.

ARMANI EXPANDS HIS TASTE FOR NEW VENTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fettuccine Armani? It's possible, beamed Giorgio Armani, who stopped in Los 
Angeles for a few hours last Friday and announced, among other things, that 
he'll have restaurants in his new Emporio shops slated to open in Europe this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Emporio Armani is the Italian designer's zippy young sportswear collection for 
men and women, with lower prices than his regular Giorgio Armani lines. It is 
fast becoming the status label among trendy young Europeans, who buy it in 150 
free-standing Emporio shops that dot the Continent and will soon invade the 
Orient and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for expansion of Emporio, which Armani calls "my favorite child," include 
10 new boutiques in England, 10 in Germany, 4 in France and 75 in Japan. A 
10,000-square-foot Emporio will open on lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First to Open 
</P>
<P>
The first Cafe Armani opens Feb. 14 within the new Emporio in the Knightsbridge 
district of London, Armani said. The 50-seat eatery will have the decor of a 
sleek, 1930s railroad dining car and will offer light, all-natural foods like 
those he eats. (Armani serves simple, vegetarian meals at his own home, a 
16th-Century palazzo in Milan.) 
</P>
<P>
Another Armani restaurant, same menu, will open in March in his new Florence, 
Italy, shop. 
</P>
<P>
Armani has looked for the right spot to open a Los Angeles Emporio, but says he 
hasn't found it yet. Besides, he admitted, he'd like to make sure his recently 
opened Rodeo Drive Giorgio Armani boutique is properly launched before he 
commits to any other L.A. endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
He needn't worry. The King of Italian fashion has a worldwide clientele of the 
fashionable and famous, including many top Hollywood names. (He will reportedly 
do costumes for an upcoming Meryl Streep film, but would not confirm it.) 
</P>
<P>
And as proof of their devotion, about 40 Los Angeles friends turned up for a 
luncheon last Friday to which they were invited only hours before. (Armani had 
a 5-hour layover here on his way home to Milan from vacation in Bora Bora.) 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute Bistro Gardens guest list included Lakers coach Pat Riley (who 
wears Armani on the cover of GQ this month), Elton John, Dennis Hopper, Ali 
MacGraw, Alexander Godunov, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Diane Lane, Gordon Thompson, 
"Mississippi Burning" director Alan Parker, Mike and Patricia Medavoy and 
sculptor Robert Graham. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, the designer inspected his new Rodeo Drive shop, which he hadn't 
seen since its completion. 
</P>
<P>
How did he like the store? 
</P>
<P>
"I would need days to understand this space, which is all about subtlety and 
details," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
It was a thoughtful appraisal of the 13,000-square-foot boutique, which ranks 
among the more elaborate architectural understatements in L.A. retailing. It is 
the largest of his U.S. boutiques and is expected to gross $17 million this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Is a Rare Species 
</P>
<P>
Armani is not glib. And though his life style appears relaxed and his social 
connections glamorous, he is known within the industry as a workaholic, a 
perfectionist and a design genius. He is also prolific. In addition to the 
multiple menswear and women's-wear collections he designs each season, he said 
he personally designs all the shoes, ties, scarfs, umbrellas, belts and other 
accessories that bear his logo. In other words, he is that rare species: a 
successful designer with no licensees. "I would never sell my name for use by 
someone else, just to earn money." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, when he first designed under his own label, Armani has won 
worldwide acclaim for inventing unconstructed men's clothes and minimalist 
women's sportswear so unique that they are immediately identifiable as Armani 
to any fashion buff who sees them. 
</P>
<P>
But what on Earth was this taste maker wearing on his feet, a reporter asked on 
Friday, staring at what looked suspiciously like well-worn American Topsiders. 
"They're by Timberland," Armani laughed. "I only wear them on holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was he dressed to impress. His pale, cotton knit polo shirt, rumpled jacket 
and blue wash pants were obviously vacation clothes, which he said he had worn 
for 14 hours on the plane and then out to lunch. If he had been "dressed as 
usual," he would have been in the navy sweater and gray pants outfit he 
normally wears to greet guests after fashion shows in the theater of his Milan 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear navy because I don't like to be noticed and it helps to fade me out," 
Armani said, typically humble. As Women's Wear Daily once wrote of him, "like a 
simple, country doctor, Armani's manner and personality are devoid of 
affectation. There are no stereotyped fashion house-head mannerisms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profits and Awards 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to hear Armani talk, he doesn't even realize he's "arrived." Forget 
the $350-million annual gross, the numerous fashion awards, the worldwide 
reputation for creativity and understated elegance. Armani leaned back in his 
chair the other day, pondered his goals and announced he "would like to build 
something lasting." 
</P>
<P>
"I want all my boutiques, and the merchandise inside them, to have 
lasting-power. Nothing must be disposable or good for just one season or two. 
That sounds simple, but it is the hardest thing for a designer to do." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but his clothes are already collectors' items, worn until they are 
threadbare by some of his fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do the same for home furnishings," Armani said. He will begin with 
Emporio-label stationery, paper goods and sachets, he said. Eventually, he will 
design all sorts of Emporio home accessories, including bed linens and towels.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: PBS STAGES SMASHING, 'VERY BRITISH COUP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Perkins is a menace. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the view of the rigid Establishment -- America's CIA, 
conservative elements of the British media and bureaucracy and the highest 
echelons of Perkins' own government -- which sees in this newly elected prime 
minister a monstrous threat who shows "alarming signs of turning into a major 
statesman." 
</P>
<P>
They're terrified because Perkins is a strong-willed reformer, a Laborite 
outsider and third-generation steelworker determined to sweep away musty ways 
and fulfill the campaign pledges he made to the British electorate that 
overwhelmingly elected him over his Tory opponent -- presumably Margaret 
Thatcher. Not merely distrusted because of a revolutionary agenda that includes 
dismantling nuclear weapons and ridding British soil of U.S. military bases, he 
is also targeted for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It's the 1990s, a very appropriate setting for "A Very British Coup." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a promise: You'll find nothing better on television than this rousing, 
provocative political thriller from Britain, airing on PBS in two parts Sunday 
and Monday under the "Masterpiece Theatre" banner (at 8 each night on Channels 
50 and 24, at 9 on Channels 28 and 15). 
</P>
<P>
It's smashing. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also find no more exhilarating performance than Ray McAnally's as 
Perkins. An actor of infinite surprises who keeps you intrigued by appearing 
always to withhold a little something, McAnally's work both as Perkins and that 
endearing cad Rick Pym of last fall's "A Perfect Spy" on PBS affirms his lofty 
ranking among character actors. He's a whopper. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist McAnally plays here is a tough, pragmatic, charming, slippery, 
TV-smart populist of a politician who initially seems caught off guard by the 
crippling problems he faces in office and the depth of the conspiracy to 
undermine him. He's not a man to be underestimated, however, even though the 
clandestine conspirators opposing him include a powerful media lord a la Rupert 
Murdoch and Britain's closest ally, the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Infused by John Keane's tense, dizzying music, Mick Jackson's electrifying 
direction creates somber tones of mystery and foreboding. He does more than 
place you on the perilous political high wire with Perkins. He also puts you 
inside the minds of the loathing plotters who consider Perkins intolerably 
radical. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect the freedoms our ancestors bequeathed to us," sniffs Sir 
Percy Browne (wonderfully played by Alan MacNaughtan), the government's 
shadowy, thin-lipped, elegantly malevolent intelligence chief, a dangerous 
extension of those enduring government types who become calcified to their jobs 
and tradition. 
</P>
<P>
A sort of silky J. Edgar Hoover, Browne and his smarmy, goose-necked assistant 
have at their disposal vast computerized files on everyone and the latest in 
electronic bugging and spying technology that allows them to track virtually 
every move the prime minister makes. 
</P>
<P>
Less fiction than reasonable conjecture, "A Very British Coup" is that 
endangered television species -- something to chew on. The notion that, in 
various degrees, even democracies include secret governments within governments 
that operate beyond view and without public mandate is chillingly real, 
reinforced by such contemporary U.S. history as the Watergate and Iran-Contra 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted by Alan Plater from a Chris Mullin novel, "A Very British Coup" 
presents a particularly terrifying scenario by seeming to place a head of state 
in the lethal grip of not only his political enemies but also his own 
subordinates. The story's plot twists, dark alleys and hairpin curves all 
encourage a feeling of uneasiness. 
</P>
<P>
Always slow to back formidable, potentially controversial stories about 
Washington politics, American television has offered nothing comparable to "A 
Very British Coup," which aired on Britain's bold Channel Four network. Its 
closest American counterpart this season would be "Favorite Son," an utterly 
absurd and repellent NBC clunker about an amoral vice-presidential aspirant and 
his murderous aide who lusted for power and kinky sex. "Hollywood Wives" had 
more relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Looming ahead for Hollywood scenarists is Oliver North, with one miniseries 
about the life and times of Ronald Reagan's favorite son already in the works. 
If honest and well executed, it may partially fill a void. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American viewers can decide for themselves if there are lessons for 
our own government in "A Very British Coup," whose conspirators are too 
enamored of their own opinions to trust the will of the people.

<P>
Robert Morris, 57, is an entrenched New York artist of a generation that had 
one foot in the sparest of minimal sculpture like that of Donald Judd and the 
other in surrealist fetishism like the work of Walter de Maria. Morris' work 
has not been seen in any depth around here since the days of the old Dwan 
gallery, so we are grateful for a museum-like survey even if it turns out to be 
an object lesson in what an artist ought not to do. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest works on view are large spare objects such as a huge pair of steel 
wheels or three big "L" shapes fashioned of black mesh wire. They are new works 
based on drawings from the '60s. This is curious because Morris' work has 
evolved drastically since then and it is hard to figure why he'd want to go 
back to an earlier incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are big hanging shapes of black felt, one of which is vaguely 
suggestive of a giant cowl for a black mass. So far everything is about equally 
provocative and ambiguous, leaving us mental room to contemplate the puzzling 
border where pure formalism leaves off and expression takes up. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately things grow clearer in a work like "Golden Memories," which is 
made of an ingot-like metal corner bar festooned with a nasty hanging hook an a 
bit of knotted rope. At this point we recall that Morris is the artist who once 
posed for an exhibition poster with his naked torso wrapped in chains and his 
head menacingly clad in a Nazi helmet. Suddenly this is all very suggestive of 
Crock, the cartoon character, running around bashing his subalterns with his 
iron glove. 
</P>
<P>
Morris' recent work here consists of photographs of corpses piled in the manner 
of the death camps or set out in rows like executed prisoners. These are daubed 
with color and surrounded by enormous frames made of cast body parts including 
skulls and hands gripping penises of impossible proportion. Their elaborate 
morbidity is almost funny -- like some send-up of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," 
but there is no humor in them. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson is that some artists should not make their intentions literally 
clear. Unless you happen to share this art's tiresome narcissistic obsessions 
with macho violence, sex and death, the work is as drearily predictable as a 
definition from Kraft-Ebbing. It suffocates intelligence and strangles 
imagination. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to Feb. 11.)

A dash of Man Ray's zany surreal photo manipulations, a pinch of brave new 
world technology and a good bit of popular tabloid gimmickry imbue eerie 
Polaroid portraits by New Yorker Nancy Burson. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a painter, Burson became intrigued with translating photographed 
portraits into the digitized language of computers, hoping to mathematically 
manipulate -- for instance, "age" or recombine -- faces according to pre-set 
parameters and programs. Burson and husband collaborator David Kramlick 
patented the software to systematically "age" faces, making "People" magazine 
with geriatric versions of Lady Di and Brooke Shields and helping the FBI with 
"aged" composite photos of missing children. 
</P>
<P>
Well and fine, but was it art? Burson's mid '80s "Composites" established her 
among wry political-conceptual photographers such as Cindy Sherman. "Big 
Brother," a computer combination of Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Khomeini and 
Mussolini, or "Warhead," a hybrid of nuclear power leaders Thatcher, Brezhnev 
and Reagan, put a face on abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
In this show Burson's computer scrambling creates invented faces from the 
photographed features of two or more portraits of mostly children. She's used 
Victorian period death portraits and photos of physically deformed children, 
mixed in with the heavily lashed, marble eyes or too perfectly formed porcelain 
features of play dolls. Once Burson achieves the computer image she's after, 
she shoots black and white Polaroids straight from the monitor. The result is a 
macabre collection of innocents, victims and carnival freaks who test the 
membrane between real and fictional, tugging at our pathos, curiosity and 
repulsion as tangibly as if they lived next door. (Jan Kesner, 164 La Brea 
Ave., to Feb 18.) MARLENA DONOHUE

The interplay of order and chance are at work in painted steel, wall-mounted 
sculptures by William Dwyer. Using different gauges of wire, from thick and 
stalwart in "Compression Square" to thin and spidery in "One x One Factor," 
Dwyer makes three-dimensional grids often broken up by several inch lengths of 
brightly painted wire. 
</P>
<P>
As the viewer looks through the grids, patterns of line and color emerge, 
sometimes producing a taut de Stijl arrangement, sometimes looking like the 
layout of a micro chip. 
</P>
<P>
"Compression Square" looks too much like those awful wrought iron window guards 
necessitated by urban living, and other works are overly tame. "Zenith" 
effectively manipulates interactions between the viewing space, viewers' 
perceptions of color and depth and that old standby: pleasant design. (Kiyo 
Higashi, 8332 Melrose Ave., to Feb. 16.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Gregory Vose attempts some sprightly turns in a clutch of marble pieces marking 
his first local one-person show. Small odd forms, witty cuts and generally 
light-handed treatment of a heavy-duty medium are all good signs. 
</P>
<P>
In "Botticelli," a white tray-shape perched on a graceful, three-footed metal 
stand holds a tall, faceted twist of white marble enveloping a ball and -- at a 
distance -- a small phallic squiggle lying on its side. "Little Egypt," a 
semi-abstract tabletop piece, suggests a reference to the famous burlesque 
artist via a zig-zag "profile" and peek-a-boo "belly." But when he reaches for 
a heavier theme in "Ozymandias," Vose doesn't allow the faceted bulky black 
marble pieces on the floor to be read with sufficient clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra Benjamin's paintings and watercolors are mostly of the organic-flow 
variety, with ribbons of bright color curving through space. A dated approach 
even in watercolor, where at least technical control is at issue, this imagery 
has little to redeem it as rendered flatly in acrylic paint, with a few drips 
and splatters suggesting a timid attempt at improvisation. (Gallery 454, 454 
Robertson Blvd., to Feb. 4.) CATHY CURTIS

*** 1/2 "Alphaville" 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseur. $69.95. 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Luc Godard is an acquired taste for many filmgoers, largely because of his 
seemingly perverse insistence on always exposing his materials, on insisting 
that a movie is a movie is a movie. "Alphaville" is a mixture of private eye 
thriller and science fiction, seemingly modelled, in equal parts, on "The Big 
Sleep," "Metropolis" and Jean Cocteau's "Orpheus." Eddie Constantine -- a 
popular American star of French movies -- is sent here to "Alphaville," a 
dehumanized city of night, run by computers, somewhere in the outer galaxy. All 
of the movie was shot in actual locations in 1965 Paris, to emphasize the 
movie's metaphor: This cybernetic hell is not some piece of myth. It is here 
and now, on top of us. Godard's metaphoric approach kills immediacy -- the 
actors move like puppets through a fluorescent, metallic maze. In this bright 
hell of expressionless faces, Constantine's violence becomes the only cri de 
couer, Anna Karina's Gish-like profile the only icon of soft flesh. A brainy, 
strange film: cold on top, hot underneath. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

When the Times Sunday Calendar compiled its annual "critics' consensus" last 
Sunday, there was a surprise No. 1 favorite 1988 film. "The Thin Blue Line," 
Errol Morris' documentary examining the circumstantial evidence that may have 
convicted the wrong man in a Texas cop-killing, topped "Bull Durham" (No. 2) 
and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (No. 3) in the poll of 100 American newspaper and 
magazine reviewers. Since a lot fewer people saw "The Thin Blue Line" in 
theaters than those fictional pictures, many video renters may be asking for a 
peek at the documentary this weekend, when HBO Video releases it on cassette. 
(The price for the MPAA-unrated work is $89.99.) 
</P>
<P>
Pat McGilligan and Mark Rowland, who conducted the poll, also listed the 10 
movies that the critics disliked the most; another of this week's video 
releases placed fourth on that list: "The Great Outdoors" (MCA, $89.95, PG), an 
excruciatingly unfunny comedy starring Dan Aykroyd as an obnoxious guy who 
torments brother-in-law John Candy during a summer vacation. Also new from MCA: 
"Phantasm II" ($89.95, R), an unexceptional 1988 horror sequel. 
</P>
<P>
Take MASH's Loretta Swit, veteran English comedian Peter Cook, and two of those 
brilliant actors from the wild British TV show "The Young Ones" (Rik Mayall and 
Alexei Sayle), put them in a black comedy about nuclear war, and you've got 
"Whoops Apocalypse" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R), which received extremely limited 
theatrical release last year. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA also has two marginal oldies on tape this week for $29.95 each: "Never 
So Few," a 1959 WWII drama set in Burma and starring Frank Sinatra, and "Guns 
of the Magnificent Seven," a 1969 Western sequel starring George Kennedy and 
James Whitmore. The same company has reduced "Ice Station Zebra" to $29.95, a 
price fans of the Cold-War thriller can afford even if they're not Howard 
Hughes (whose favorite film this reportedly was). 
</P>
<P>
Other Videos 
</P>
<P>
Two superstar names appear on two new non-movie videocassettes. One, Jane 
Fonda, has been there many times before; her latest fitness tape, "Jane Fonda's 
Complete Workout" is $29.98 from Warner. Michael Jackson's "Moonwalker" (CMV, 
$24.98) was reviewed in Tuesday's Calendar by Dennis Hunt, who wrote: "Forget 
the hype about 'Moonwalker' being avant-garde cinema or 94 minutes of 
mind-blowing surrealism. This is just a collection of music videos promoting 
Jackson's 'Bad' album. . . ." TERRY ATKINSON

BARYSHNIKOV &amp; FRIENDS OFFER PASTICHE ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Do you accept the term "concert version" to describe a one-act ballet that's 
been cut in half? That's how the PBS "Dance in America" series labels its 
drastic abridgement of "Who Cares?" in the two-part program called "Baryshnikov 
Dances Balanchine With American Ballet Theatre" tonight (9 p.m. on Channels 28, 
15 and 24; Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 50). 
</P>
<P>
The program title is also misleading, since American Ballet Theatre has never 
had "Who Cares?" in its repertory. In truth, what you're seeing are productions 
devised for a "Baryshnikov &amp; Friends" tour, one of those private, 
off-season ventures in which a superstar and a small number of colleagues visit 
cities where major companies seldom perform. 
</P>
<P>
This small, unacknowledged fact explains the absence of a corps in "Who Cares?" 
and the presence in "Apollo" of New York City Ballet principal Stephanie 
Saland. It also may account for the sense of stylistic dislocation in both 
ballets -- each of which has been previously seen on PBS in a more persuasive 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov is in superb physical condition throughout. The finale of "Who 
Cares?" has even been rechoreographed and now accommodates his familiar 
specialties: high-velocity compression-turns and hops on the working leg while 
turning. But he works far too hard here to ever seem relaxed or easygoing; the 
throwaway Americanisms look forced, the partnering effortful. 
</P>
<P>
In "Apollo," Baryshnikov dances with great concern for the unorthodox plastique 
of the choreography but is sometimes mannered, as if he's decided that Apollo 
is a Soviet-style character role. In other passages, however, he embodies 
neoclassic nobility -- and the extremes fail to mesh. 
</P>
<P>
The links between "Apollo" (1928; music by Stravinsky) and "Who Cares?" (1970; 
music by Gershwin) have long preoccupied dance critics, so putting the two 
ballets together ought to be more stimulating than this telecast suggests. Part 
of the problem comes from casting Christine Dunham as both Terpsichore in 
"Apollo" and her counterpart in "Who Cares?" Dunham dances with great 
refinement and a sumptuous softness, but never defines either role strongly 
enough for us to see its reflection in the other. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Leslie Browne dances Polyhymnia in "Apollo" and the "Stairway to 
Paradise" role in "Who Cares?" forcefully -- but as if they were exactly the 
same. In the latter work, Deirdre Carberry is a bit shaky in her solo but 
assured in the duet with Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
Matching Dunham's purity, but with a sharper, more crystalline quality of 
movement, Saland is exceptional as Calliope in "Apollo." For once, Apollo 
chooses the wrong Muse. 
</P>
<P>
Taped in Denmark, the telecast is decently directed by Thomas Grimm. Paul 
Connelly conducts the Danish Radio Concert Orchestra. The fine solo pianist in 
"Who Cares?" is uncredited, but ABT manages to list everyone on its payroll 
down to the company masseur.

'VISIONS' HAS A NEW-AGE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "New Visions" series presented every Sunday evening on cable's VH-1 channel 
is doing a commendable job of combining in-person music and interview shows 
(hosted by Ben Sidran) with videos of jazz and New Age artists. 
</P>
<P>
The first of this Sunday's two hours will be devoted to Fahreed Haque, a 
guitarist of Pakistani origin. Haque's music, performed both finger-style and 
with a plectrum, effectively blends jazz, folk and New Age elements. He is 
accompanied by David Spinoza on rhythm guitar and the eminent Harvie Swartz on 
upright bass. 
</P>
<P>
Sidran, who has many credits of his own as pianist, singer and composer, knows 
what questions to ask and how to keep the interviews reasonably interesting, 
though Haque comes across as a far-from-dynamic personality. 
</P>
<P>
Splitting the show with him is the duo of Carla Bley and Steve Swallow. Playing 
material from their recent album, they are an intriguing couple. Bley, a 
pianist and composer who has one foot in the avant-garde and the other in sheer 
satire, remains largely invisible through her great mass of blond hair; even 
during the interview, her eyes cannot be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Her slightly Monkish solos are conservative by her own normally abnormal 
standards. Bley tells Sidran that her attempts to be commercial having failed 
to sell, she plans to "do more weird stuff." An odd woman and self-described 
cult hero, she is at least never dull. Swallow backs her capably on electric 
bass. LEONARD FEATHER

BOA IS A PUSSYCAT AT MEDIA CIRCUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The doctors said Sid Vicious, the snake, was a perfect patient. But dealing 
with the news media, they said, was a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Vicious, an 8-foot boa constrictor owned by Mission Viejo High School, 
underwent laser treatment at UC Irvine on Thursday afternoon for cancer of the 
mouth. Laser specialists and veterinarians working on the snake proclaimed the 
therapy a success. 
</P>
<P>
But "the flash cameras in the operating room were driving me crazy," one 
veterinarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists from four television stations, one independent network and assorted 
newspapers converged on the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic at UCI. 
Because the operating room was small, the university set up a pool arrangement 
for television. Still photographers and print reporters got to stay inside, 
where they literally stepped on each other while documenting Sid's 12-minute 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Sid had little privacy. Immediately before the laser treatment, Dr. Scott 
Weldy, a veterinarian, held up the sleepy-looking boa. Weldy noted that Sid had 
been given a mild anesthetic: "He's beginning to look a little stupid now." 
Lights flashed and TV cameras whirred. 
</P>
<P>
Then the specialists took Sid into the operating room and stretched him out on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
"Why aren't we getting this?" yelled a TV reporter to a harried assistant. "I 
want this to go on the air." The agitated reporter demanded that the 
patient-entry scene be repeated. The doctors good-naturedly complied. They 
removed Sid from the operating table, hauled him out, then made another 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Sid, meanwhile, looked zonked out under the surgical lights. Then the lights 
were turned off, and the intense red laser was focused on Sid's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Sid began moving restlessly on the table. "I think the camera flashes are 
bothering his eyes," Weldy said. He and assistants taped cotton over the 
snake's eyes. Then the laser therapy continued. 
</P>
<P>
In the hall, a television reporter said: "Oprah should think about getting this 
act on her show." 
</P>
<P>
Emmett Carlson, the Mission Viejo High biology teacher whose classroom is Sid's 
home, said students "noticed something on Sid's lip a few weeks ago, and we 
later found it was cancer. We hope the treatment is successful and Sid 
survives. He's a great favorite of the students." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Berns, director of the Beckman Laser Institute, said, "This is the 
first time in the world that this type of operation on a snake is being done. 
We're using a new drug that has potential for use with human cancer patients." 
</P>
<P>
The new drug, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine, was injected into Sid 
and concentrated in his tumor. The laser reacted with the chemical, burning off 
the destructive cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
Human patients who are treated with other drugs and laser therapy report an 
itching sensation when the laser succeeds in burning cancer cells. Sid's 
movements, Berns said, indicated that the treatment was working. 
</P>
<P>
"It went very successfully," Weldy said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Weldy, Berns and Carlson held a press conference at which even Sid 
Vicious was present. Weldy had placed the sleeping snake in a pillowcase. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to get away from the cameras for a while," Weldy explained. "He's 
getting a little photosensitive."

CONVICTION OVERTURNED IN FAMILY BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you be convicted of burglary if you steal something in your own home? 
</P>
<P>
Michael Glenn Rowe, 33, of Orange had been sentenced to 7 years in prison for 
stealing jewelry and a pistol from the home where he says he lived with his 
mother and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
But the state 4th District Court of Appeal threw out his convictions Thursday, 
ruling that Rowe's jury should have had better instructions concerning Rowe's 
defense that you cannot burglarize your own home. 
</P>
<P>
Here were the circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who had been convicted on previous robbery charges, lived with his mother 
and stepfather but was involved in a family dispute with them. He moved in with 
a girlfriend, but kept his things at his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, however, had his things packaged and stored in the garage. His 
parents also had the locks on the door changed. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe was arrested in August, 1986, after his parents discovered that a ring and 
a handgun were missing from their home. Rowe later admitted to Orange police 
that he had taken them and hocked them at a pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe's primary contention at his trial was that no matter what he had done, he 
certainly could not be guilty of burglary, because it was his own home. And he 
said he did, indeed, have a key that fit the door. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville, in a unanimous opinion for the appellate 
court, ruled that you can be convicted of burglarizing your own home, if your 
access to that home is conditional. 
</P>
<P>
The justice said if the jurors had accepted Rowe's argument that there were no 
restrictions on his coming and going into the house, they may not have known 
that this was a reason to acquit him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury should have been told that "an unconditional right to enter a dwelling 
is a complete defense to the charge of burglary," Scoville ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe had ended up with a 2-year sentence on convictions of burglary and grand 
theft, but Superior Court Judge John H. Smith Jr. added 5 years because of his 
prior robbery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court threw out the convictions for both burglary and grand 
theft. The county district attorney's office must now decide whether to retry 
the case.

LARGER SCHOOLS MIGHT WANT ORANGE LUTHERAN TO PICK ON SOMEONE ITS OWN SIZE

David versus Goliath, Underdog, The Little Engine That Could . . . 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Orange Lutheran High School boys' basketball team just cannot 
live down the comparisons. No matter how hard it tries. 
</P>
<P>
The real story of Orange Lutheran -- exceptional athletes, increased team pride 
and confidence -- has been all but overshadowed by the romantic notion that 
Orange Lutheran, having come close to beating schools four or five times its 
size, has become the giant killer of Orange County basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Has it? Well, not quite. Though that hasn't discouraged the ever-growing number 
of Lancer basketball fans. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Orange Lutheran -- a Southern Section 2-A school with an 
enrollment of about 500 -- is small compared with the majority of some 65 high 
schools in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Orange Lutheran (11-3 overall, 4-0 in the Olympic League) has 
proven that it can play with the bigger schools. Because of that, and the 
publicity it has brought to the school, the Lancers have received more 
attention on campus and from alumni than in the past several years combined. 
</P>
<P>
Home crowds, once numbering fewer than 50, are at an all-time high. More than 
1,000 are expected tonight when the Lancers play host to Whittier Christian in 
an Olympic League game at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
"The band's even coming," Orange Lutheran Principal Richard Klatt said. 
"They've never wanted to come to basketball games before. Now they're 
volunteering." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (10-3, 3-0), which has won six league championships in the 
past 7 years, had to settle for a co-championship last season with Orange 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game should begin to settle the question of whether Orange Lutheran 
is, as some suspect, ready to step forward and dethrone the Heralds. 
</P>
<P>
Center Pat Bagatourian, forward Daryl Cole and off-guard Jason Neben are the 
main keys to Orange Lutheran's success this season. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet 2-inches, Bagatourian, who is averaging 21 points a game and shooting 
62% from the field, is not one of the tallest centers in the county by any 
means. But his height, Coach Jerry Simmons said, is no indication of his 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat's a center in a guard's body," Simmons said. "He's 6-2, but it's a tough 
6-2. His heart makes him more like 6-10, really." 
</P>
<P>
Cole, averaging 24 points, is one of the county's best pure shooters. "He'd 
always been a scorer," Lancer assistant Chuck Thomas said. "But now he's asking 
what else can he do for the team. His defense and rebounding have really made a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Neben, a talented option quarterback and long jumper, is the team's best 
athlete. Only 6 feet, he has a tremendous vertical leap. He has three slams so 
far this season. 
</P>
<P>
The other starters are junior forward Kent Dowding, an aggressive defensive 
specialist, and point guard Luke Aucoin, who despite being a freshman, has 
demonstrated poise and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Around campus, Lancer basketball, once a non-issue, now is a trendy subject. 
Especially after the Lancers came so close to beating three prestigious 
programs, each of which is more than four times Orange Lutheran's size. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran lost to San Bernardino Cajon, a 4-AA school with an enrollment 
of 2,150, 70-69, in early December. Capistrano Valley (5-A, 2,400) had to go to 
overtime to defeat the Lancers, 85-81, Dec. 27. And Long Beach Wilson (5-AA, 
2,900) defeated the Lancers, 62-60, Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Capistrano Valley game that generated the most excitement. The 
Cougars were the county's seventh-ranked team at the time, but the Lancers 
outplayed Capistrano Valley most of the game. 
</P>

Lancermania was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the Capo game, a lot of people, like classmates and stuff, were trying 
to make Capo bigger than they were," Neben said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying stuff like, 'You guys are gonna get your butts kicked.' But 
then after the game, everyone's all, 'Wow! You guys are good! We're so 
surprised.' A guy from last year's team came up said, 'You guys are awesome!' " 
</P>
<P>
The players say the increased school support has given them a major confidence 
boost. But some of the players point out that, in some respects, it has also 
become a bit of a bother. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when people start comparing the Lancers to giant killers. Other than 
a 71-65 victory over University (enrollment 2,180), the Lancers have not 
actually beaten a school with a great difference in enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, everybody's making a big deal out of the Capo game, but we 
lost," Bagatourian said. "Even though we lost by 4, what's the difference if 
it's 4 or 20? A loss is a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say we haven't accomplished as much as everyone says we have. I don't 
think we're deserving of all of this (attention). 
</P>
<P>
"But everybody's trying to make us into the Little Hooisers story. It kind of 
bothers me because it doesn't matter if you're a big school or a little school. 
What matters is just that a team goes out on the court, and if five guys can 
play, then that's what matters."

January appears to be a big month for consummating deals. Among the bigger ones 
announced recently: Irvine developer O'Donnell, Armstrong &amp; Partners bought 
131 acres in Rancho Cucamonga for $15 million with the Boston Co., a 
Massachusetts pension fund adviser, and plans to build 2.5 million square feet 
of factories and warehouses. Construction on the land -- next to a similar 
O'Donnell project -- begins in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Erin Mason Ltd. Inc. of Newport Beach bought 300 acres in Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties from Ahmanson Commercial Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
for $18.5 million. Erin Mason said it would build roads and other amenities and 
sell lots to heavy industry.

<P>

for $13.7 million from Balcor Realty Co. of Skokie, Ill. Located on Williams 
Street, the complex has 224 units. 
</P>
<P>
And the Coopers &amp; Lybrand accounting firm signed a $7.9-million lease for 
28,000 square feet of office space at 4675 MacArthur Court in Newport Beach, an 
Irvine Co. building. Coldwell Banker represented the landlord.

ALMANAC / COUNTY'S HOTELS AND MOTELS: OCCUPANCY DROPS BUT PRICES DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The room occupancy rate at Orange County's hotels and motels dropped to 70.7% 
from 71.9% in the 10 months ending in October, 1987 compared to the 
year-earlier period, according to Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting and hotel 
consulting firm. The average daily room rate rose to $69.90 from $68.46. 
</P>
<P>
The airport-Newport Beach area was the only one of four county areas that 
registered an increase in occupancy. The tourist-rich Anaheim area showed a 2% 
drop, but it still had the highest occupancy rate, 75.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel rooms in the county are a relative bargain compared to other California 
cities. A separate survey of average room rates in the first 9 months of last 
year showed that San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles all were more 
expensive to stay in than Orange County.

MCDONNELL COMPUTER WILL INSTALL HUNTINGTON BEACH DISPATCH SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Co., a Santa Ana subsidiary of the defense 
and aerospace conglomerate, said Thursday that it has been chosen by the city 
of Huntington Beach to install a computerized fire and emergency medical 
dispatch system for $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Company President Willard J. Freeman said the computer-aided-dispatch market 
has emerged as McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems' most rapidly growing 
business. He estimated that the market for the product doubled last year to 
$100 million. The company has sold about 40 similar systems around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Fire Chief Ray Picard said the new system should reduce the 
time it takes fire, police and medical crews to reach an emergency by at least 
25%. Installation should be completed by July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The system should prove particularly effective in deploying emergency services 
during periods of heavy calling, such as during a flood. The system is designed 
to have help on the way within 20 seconds of the first call and within 60 
seconds of all subsequent calls, Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas system will be tied into the 911 emergency telephone 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a fire, for instance, the 911 operator would, at the push of a 
button, alert the Fire Department, where a buzzer would sound. A computer 
screen at the Fire Department would instantly display the location of the 
person reporting the emergency, plus any information that the 911 receiver 
takes down. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 911 operator must telephone the Police or Fire Department, which 
in turn must take the operator's information. This process is more 
time-consuming, particularly if the calls back up, Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between a response time of 1 minute and 2 minutes 
when your house is on fire, or when you're not breathing," Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department experienced its worst backlog in responding to emergency 
calls during a flood in the mid-1970s, Picard said. During a 12-hour period, 
the department was overwhelmed by 713 calls. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, which employs about 1,000 people, designs 
and manufactures a variety of computer hardware and software products. Among 
its products is the hardware for McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Tymnet system, the 
widely used global computer communications network. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly Micro Data, McDonnell Douglas Computer has been in Orange County since 
its founding 16 years ago. McDonnell Douglas acquired the company in 1984. It 
has manufacturing facilities in Santa Ana and in Great Britain.

PARADIGM RENEWS ITS BID TO BUY FACILITIES IN MOVE TO SAVE AILING CARE 
ENTERPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third plan to rescue Care Enterprises from bankruptcy has been submitted, 
this time by a company that is renewing its bid to buy skilled nursing 
facilities from the Tustin-based nursing home chain. 
</P>
<P>
In a plan filed Wednesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, 
Paradigm Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, seeks to acquire 22 nursing homes and other 
property owned by Care Enterprise subsidiaries in Ohio, New Mexico and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Paradigm attorney Rick Bruner said Paradigm would assume about $25 million 
worth of mortgages and development-bond debt on the facilities that it wants to 
acquire. It would also pay the operational debts of those facilities, as well 
as an undetermined portion of the approximately $40 million in long-term bank 
debt owed by Care Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Paradigm said the value of the transaction would be about $43.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Paradigm's plan to help Care pay its debts is similar to offers that the Ohio 
company made to acquire Care nursing homes a year ago, before Care petitioned 
in March for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. In 
the last of those offers, Paradigm proposed paying $66.2 million for 26 nursing 
homes, including $18.7 million in cash and the assumption of $47.5 million of 
Care's debt. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Care's board of directors determined that it was not in the 
best interests of the company to negotiate the sale of any of its facilities to 
Paradigm, in part because the company was embroiled in management-contract 
litigation with Paradigm's principal owner, Ralph Hazelbaker. That litigation 
is still pending, Bruner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelbaker is a former officer and director of Americare, which in 1985 sold to 
Care many of the same facilities that Paradigm now is seeking to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner said Paradigm wants to acquire the assets of eight Care subsidiaries, 
all of which are in bankruptcy: First Ohio Investment Group, Americare Corp., 
Americare Southwest Inc., Americare Southwest of Arizona Inc., Ladera Health 
Care Center Inc., Rio Rancho Health Care Center Inc., Las Palomas Health Care 
Center Inc. and Boon County Health Care Center Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Paradigm's plan will be considered next month by the Bankruptcy Court, along 
with alternative plans proposed by Care Enterprises management and a committee 
of Care Enterprises' unsecured creditors, both of which call for the sale of 
some Care Enterprises facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner said Paradigm is attempting to obtain access to more information about 
the financial condition of Care Enterprises' facilities to fill in the details 
of its proposal.

CHAPMAN, MCFERRIN LEAD GRAMMY RACE; 
</P>
<P>
BAKER, STING, MICHAEL, WINWOOD ALSO CAPTURE MUTLIPLE NOMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tracy Chapman won the nominations derby Thursday in the first leg of the record 
industry's 31st annual Grammy Awards competition. 
</P>
<P>
The folk-minded singer-songwriter's six nominations nosed out jazz singer Bobby 
McFerrin, who had five, and pop-jazz artist Anita Baker, who picked up four. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's self-titled debut album, which has sold more than 2 million copies, 
features the hit single "Fast Car." Her nominations are for best record, album, 
song, pop vocal, contemporary folk record and new artist. 
</P>
<P>
If the 24-year-old Boston-based artist wins in all categories, it will be the 
biggest sweep in the history of the recording industry awards. Winners will be 
announced Feb. 22 during a nationally televised ceremony at the Shrine 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, who has won five jazz Grammys, was introduced to pop audiences 
through his hit single "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Besides being nominated for 
that record, he was also cited for best album ("Simple Pleasures"), pop vocal 
and song ("Don't Worry, Be Happy"). He was also nominated in the jazz vocal 
category for a work contained in Rob Wasserman's "Duets" album. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time winner Anita Baker, cited for her hit single "Giving You the Best 
That I Got," is competing in four categories -- best record and song as well as 
R &amp; B song and R &amp; B vocal. 
</P>
<P>
For best record, Baker's single, Chapman's "Fast Car" and McFerrin's "Don't 
Worry, Be Happy" are up against Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and Steve 
Winwood's "Roll With it." 
</P>
<P>
Winwood's single is from his "Roll With it" album, which is also up for album 
of the year. His competitors are Chapman, McFerrin, Sting (". . . Nothing Like 
the Sun") and George Michael ("Faith"). 
</P>
<P>
Winwood, who became the first artist to be nominated for best record three 
years in a row, was also nominated this year for best pop vocal. Sting, a 
four-time winner, is also up for three awards, including pop vocal and song 
("Be Still My Beating Heart"). 
</P>
<P>
For best song, a songwriters' award, Sting's challengers are Chapman, McFerrin, 
Baker and the team of Brenda Russell, Jeff Hall and Scott Cutler, who were 
nominated for "Piano in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
This year's big surprise was the failure of British pop sensation George 
Michael to nab more than two nominations. Michael had figured to be among the 
leaders in nominations because his "Faith" album received generally favorable 
reviews and sold more than 6 million copies. Besides the "Faith" album 
nomination, Michael's only other nod was for pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
In the best new artist category, Chapman is up against Rick Astley, Toni 
Childs, the group Take 6 and Vanessa Williams, the dethroned Miss America. 
Williams made the national pop charts last year with a single, "The Right 
Stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The winners in the 76 pop and classical categories will be determined by a vote 
of the more than 7,000 members of the National Assn. of Recording Arts and 
Sciences. Records released in the United States between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 
30, 1988, were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Two new categories were added this year: rap and hard-rock/metal. The rap 
nominees included L.L. Cool J, D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, 
Salt-N-Pepa, J.J. Fad and Kool Moe Dee. In hard-rock/metal, the competitors are 
Metallica, AC-DC, Iggy Pop, Jethro Tull and Jane's Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, male and female rock vocal nominees were lumped together because 
there were too few eligible female entries. Since this was banner year for 
female rockers, they have their own category again. The rock female finalists 
are Pat Benatar, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Sinead O'Connor and Tina 
Turner. The male rock nominees are Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Robbie Robertson, 
Robert Palmer and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
Vying with Anita Baker for the female R&amp;B vocal award are Pebbles, Taylor 
Dayne, Karyn White and Vanessa Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The male R &amp; B contenders are Luther Vandross, Stevie Wonder, Terence Trent 
D'Arby, Teddy Pendergrass and Al B. Sure!. 
</P>
<P>
In country, the finalists in the best vocal category are Emmylou Harris, K.T. 
Oslin, K.D. Lang, Reba McEntire and Tanya Tucker. For the male award, the 
challengers are Dan Seals, Dwight Yoakam, Rodney Crowell, Randy Travis and Lyle 
Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
There were few surprises in the classical field. Perennial nominees Vladimir 
Horowitz, Robert Shaw, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein -- perhaps a 
sentimental favorite in his 70th year -- filled the best album choices. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy long shots from both early and new music appeared on some of the lists. 
Period specialists Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players received a 
best orchestral recording bid for their Beethoven's Ninth, and "Nixon in China" 
was an inevitable nominee for best opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the best opera list was "A Quiet Place," by Leonard Bernstein and 
Stephen Wadsworth. Those two new operas headed the best contemporary 
composition category, which was completed with William Bolcom's Symphony No. 4, 
Ned Rorem's String Symphony (a best-album pick in the Shaw performance), and 
"Amour" by Karlheinz Stockhausen. 
</P>
<P>
 John Henken also contributed to this article.

GROVE THEATRE SAYS IT WILL TURN PRO, SHORTEN ITS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Grove Theatre Company in Garden Grove unveiled sweeping plans Thursday to 
go professional and to consolidate its 12-month season into 7 months, from June 
through December, with classical fare to be offered at both the indoor Gem 
Theatre and the outdoor Festival Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 10-year-old troupe offers a five-play amateur season of 
middle-brow programming featuring professional guest artists at the 172-seat 
Gem from October through May and, under the banner of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, a separately subscribed, semi-professional season of three 
Shakespeare plays at the 550-seat amphitheater during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, which will take effect this June, "will allow us to pool our 
production resources for both theaters, maximize our strengths artistically and 
financially and unify our marketing campaigns," Grove founder and artistic 
director Thomas F. Bradac said in an interview earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bradac said the consolidated season, despite being shorter, will present the 
same number of productions and performances as it currently does because "we 
will take a festival approach," mounting shows simultaneously rather than one 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the Gem, Grove officials announced the productions 
that will commence in June: "Romeo and Juliet," "The Two Gentlemen of Verona," 
"Twelfth Night, or What You Will," "Cyrano de Bergerac," Athol Fugard's "A 
Lesson from Aloes," "The Scoundrel" (an adaptation of Ben Jonson's "The 
Alchemist"), a play to be announced and the annual production of "A Child's 
Christmas in Wales." (See schedule on Page 26.) 
</P>
<P>
"By putting ourselves off-stride with the rest of the theaters in the county," 
Bradac said, "we will play to the strength we have already established in the 
summer. But it also enables us to get talented personnel without having to 
compete head-on for it because other theaters will be on hiatus when we're 
gearing up." 
</P>
<P>
A major change will be the implementation of an Actors Equity contract at the 
Gem, Bradac said. Under the provision for Small Professional Theaters, this 
would require that half the cast, and the stage manager, be union. Cast 
salaries, now under negotiation, have been recommended at $175 for a 
5-performance week. (The amphitheater would continue to operate under a current 
letter of agreement with Equity requiring five professional actors at $350 a 
week.) 
</P>
<P>
Grove managing director Richard A. Stein said the theater will underwrite this 
and other changes by increasing its annual budget to $660,000 in fiscal 1989-90 
-- up 16% from this year's $570,000. The theater will institute a modest rise 
in ticket prices and a new flexible subscription policy and will solicit 
private donations as well as public grants, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the company also will reap considerable fiscal benefits from the 
upcoming changes, principally by making its marketing and advertising more 
cost-effective in the effort to draw season subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The other changes include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new alliance with Cal State Fullerton. The college's drama department 
will provide rehearsal space and scenic and costume shop facilities that Grove 
lacks. In return, the theater will provide drama students with an internship 
program, utilizing them in non-Equity roles on stage and in technical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Grove used to receive financial and technical support from Rancho Santiago 
College. But that was withdrawn last year when the college decided to institute 
a semi-professional theater program of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Gem Theatre Youth Production Workshop to stage two plays from February 
through April, during the new season's "dark" months. A director will be hired 
to run the workshop, which will give hands-on experience for community actors 
and technicians ages 12 to 19. One of the plays will be chosen from the 
California Young Playwrights Program, operated by the Gas Lamp Quarter Theater 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the consolidation means we can run a single, coordinated (marketing) 
campaign that will be more concentrated," Stein said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said, the theater planned the indoor and outdoor seasons at 
different times of year and drew different audiences for each season, despite 
an overlap of about 600 subscribers. Thus, the theater had to prepare separate 
promotional literature and make separate mailings. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing everything twice was not only costly," Stein said, "it made no sense. 
Now we can also advertise in a way we couldn't do earlier. We can promote two 
plays at the same time. And our advertising dollars will stretch further." 
</P>
<P>
New ticket prices -- from $10 to $20 at the Gem and $10 to $23 at the 
amphitheater -- should not be prohibitive, Stein said. "Because we want to have 
as broad an audience as possible and do not want to disenfranchise anybody who 
can't afford tickets, we will maintain as low a bottom as we feel we can. And 
we will not increase preview prices." 
</P>
<P>
Single tickets currently run $10 to $17 at the Gem (including previews) and 
have run $15 to $18 at the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
The projected budget, to be financed by $467,000 in earned income and $193,000 
in contributed income, would allow for a decrease of 1,000 single ticket sales 
from last season's total of 13,500, he said, and would require an increase of 
only 200 season subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1,800 Shakespeare subscribers last year, and 1,600 Gem subscribers 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons will have a wide array of subscription choices: full season, indoor or 
outdoor, and a newly conceived "flexpass" providing admission to any of the 
plays in various combinations. "As Tom likes to say, we're going to make it 
very difficult for people not to subscribe," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Partial subscriptions will run as low as $30; a full-season subscription will 
cost from $70 to $149, and an eight-admission flexpass will cost $175. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of the season also will help the theater solicit donations by 
forging an image that is comprehensible to audiences and grant-making 
organizations alike, Stein said. He noted that fund-raising efforts already 
have gotten under way with substantial results. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Grove had "only a handful of corporate contributors," he said, 
with total corporate contributions of $8,500. Last year that grew to $87,000 in 
corporate gifts. 
</P>
<P>
A much-publicized funding crisis, resulting from the Garden Grove City 
Council's phase-out of a partial subsidy, spurred private contributions in 
1988. They soared to $180,000 from $47,000 the previous year, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
Long-range changes still being contemplated include touring productions around 
the county, Southern California and beyond, Bradac said. "But they will not 
happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . We're taking things one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CHAPMAN, MCFERRIN LEAD GRAMMY RACE; 
</P>
<P>
RECORDING ACADEMY STAYS ON ITS PROGRESSIVE PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman is the odds-on favorite to sweep this year's Grammy Awards 
because her socially conscious music is in perfect step with the increasingly 
dominant "progressive" wing of the Grammy membership. 
</P>
<P>
Where Grammy voters (artists, musicians, songwriters, producers) once tended to 
define pop achievement in a sociological vacuum, the tendency now is to 
acknowledge music's role in summarizing and, to some degree, shaping the times 
in which we live. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's folk-flavored tales about the struggles of society's underclass in 
her debut album lived up to that philosophy more than any other LP in this 
year's eligibility period. Her "Fast Car" was an equally significant single 
record. 
</P>
<P>
But there is strong competition in the album and single categories: Sting's ". 
. . Nothing but the Sun" album and Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" 
single. 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that the progressive-wing vote will split, allowing the more 
traditional entries by Anita Baker, Bobby McFerrin, George Michael and Steve 
Winwood to emerge the winners. However, the chances of that happening appear 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
There was a possibility of two progressive entries canceling each other out 
last year when U2's inspiring "The Joshua Tree" and Prince's equally socially 
minded "Sign 'O' the Times" were both nominated for best album. But "The Joshua 
Tree," quite correctly, won over Prince and three more traditional entries. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that predictions of victory for the likes of U2, the outstanding Irish 
rock band, and Chapman can be made with relative confidence show just how far 
the Grammy competition has progressed since it was started in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the traditionalists who dominated the Grammy balloting 
ignored the rock revolution. While some distinguished pop talents (notably 
Frank Sinatraand Barbra Streisand) were saluted along the way, the judges often 
settled on fairly undistinguished records. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, they ignored in the key categories the artists who left the 
greatest stamp on popular culture. Among them: Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, the 
Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, the Beach Boys, James Brown, Otis Redding, the 
Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
As younger, more rock-oriented musicians joined the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences (which sponsors the Grammys), the awards began in 
the '70s to reflect a balance between the the traditionalists (whose standards 
continued to swirl around studio polish, big sales and polite sounds) and the 
progressives (who reached out to more socially aggressive and ambitious 
contemporary artists). 
</P>
<P>
The argument isn't that original vision or social observation are more 
important than traditional craft, but that they are extra dimensions that add 
to the power of a record. 
</P>
<P>
There's still conservatism at work in the academy (critical favorites with 
radical edges, such as rap stars Public Enemy and rock mavericks Guns N' Roses 
have almost no chance in the most prestigious categories), but progress is 
certainly being made. 
</P>
<P>
By honoring Paul Simon's "Graceland" album and U2's "The Joshua Tree" in 1987 
and 1988 respectively, the judges showed they are on a winning streak. "Tracy 
Chapman" should make it three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Album of the Year: The choice here is between Chapman and Sting. Steve 
Winwood's "Roll With It" is a slick, but anonymous collection of largely 
undistinguished songs -- and a victory would be a major embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
George Michael, nominated for "Faith," is certainly a good singer, writer, 
producer and arranger, but he has yet to prove he is great in any of the 
categories. Bobby McFerrin's "Simple Pleasures" is an extremely likable record, 
but its strengths (imaginative vocals and arrangements) should be saluted in 
other Grammy categories. The novel a capella versions of mostly familiar tunes 
(from the Beatles' "Drive My Car" to Cream's "Sunshine of My Love") simply 
don't add up to best album credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Sting's ". . . Nothing but the Sun" would be a worthy choice most years. In the 
double-album, Sting balances seriousness of purpose and joyful musicality. But 
this is the year of Chapman, a warm and inviting mix of intimate commentary and 
sweeping compassion. 
</P>
<P>
The choice here: "Tracy Chapman." 
</P>
<P>
Record of the Year: There's a graceful aura to Anita Baker's "Giving You the 
Best That I Got," a delightfully playful edge to McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be 
Happy" and a seductive Motown bite to Winwood's "Roll With It," but none of the 
records stands as serious competition to two excellent categories: Michael 
Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car." 
</P>
<P>
"Mirror," a dramatic statement about individual responsibility from Jackson's 
"Bad" album, lives up to all the tests of a great record: excellence in the 
areas of material (it was written by Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard), 
arrangement, musicianship and impassioned vocal. 
</P>
<P>
But "Fast Car" -- a magnificently detailed account of a woman, caught in a 
poverty cycle, struggling to take control of her own -- offered an even more 
compelling and original vision. It's victory should be an inspiring signal to 
songwriters everywhere that there is room in the pop world for artists with a 
strong, distinctive point of view. 
</P>
<P>
The choice here: "Fast Car."

CRITIC AT LARGE: MCANALLY REALLY IN HIS PRIME IN 'COUP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At last year's annual conference of the Labor Party in Britain, some of the 
delegates were seen to be wearing badges that said "Harry Perkins for Prime 
Minister." 
</P>
<P>
This was a nice tribute to 62-year-old Irish actor Ray McAnally. He plays the 
Socialist steelworker who becomes prime minister in the near-future 
post-Thatcher years in the dazzling political thriller "A Very British Coup," 
which has been shown twice in Britain and which airs on PBS here Sunday and 
Monday night. (See Howard Rosenberg's adjoining review.) 
</P>
<P>
Like some Americans who found Henry Fonda so convincing as President that he 
could probably fill the office, there were murmurs that the distressed Labor 
Party might indeed think of McAnally (who is nothing if not convincing in the 
role) for P.M. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, who is visiting Los Angeles to discuss some film projects, was moved 
to write a tongue-deeply-in-cheek article for the New Statesman magazine, 
declining to run. The magazine had carried a piece asking "Is Harry Perkins the 
best prime minister the Labor Party never had?" 
</P>
<P>
In his article, McAnally noted that both Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II 
had done some acting before they went on to other work, but that he was not yet 
done with acting. "I said I'd rather be an old hand than a new statesman," 
McAnally remarked the other day with a devilish Celtic grin. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaim for his portrayal of the shrewd, tough, quick-tongued, dead-honest 
Harry Perkins has included a color picture in Time magazine. McAnally's 
preferred status as what he calls "the enigma" may be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the anonymity," McAnally says. "Maybe at a certain point, somebody will 
say, 'Wait a minute, isn't that the chap who played that other role, the 
cardinal or whatever it was?' But even then, perhaps they're not quite sure. 
Oh, no, I like not bringing a lot of baggage to a new part. I prefer being the 
enigma." 
</P>
<P>
He is, that is, the actor who immerses himself in a role so thoroughly that he 
is not the identifiable star pretending to be someone else. 
</P>
<P>
When McAnally was at the Cannes film festival with "The Mission," in which he 
indeed played the cardinal whose questioning face is the film's final image, a 
reporter kindly remarked that it was wonderful McAnally should be getting such 
acclaim for his first film. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but it wasn't quite his first film, McAnally replied. Making a joke of it 
to spare the reporter some discomfort, he added that it was actually his 207th. 
</P>
<P>
Now that was an Irish statistic, enriched by a generous infusion of blarney. 
But it might have been his 40th. McAnally's amused and enigmatic point was that 
he had been around quite a while, doing unobtrusively good work. Superior work, 
an admirer might well add. Since his early days at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, 
he has done 250 plays, 50 films, 250 television appearances and more radio 
shows than he can count. 
</P>
<P>
He worked with James Cagney in "Shake Hands With the Devil" in 1958 and with 
Gary Cooper in "The Naked Edge" in 1961. Last fall he was the ebullient con man 
Rick Pym, father of Magnus, the perfect spy, in public television's "A Perfect 
Spy." 
</P>
<P>
As Pym, he aged from 25 to 75, from the brash young trickster to a scruffy old 
man on the run, his charm and confidence now like the last bits of 
silver-plating on a cheap spoon. There was in Pym little of the sad-eyed 
worldly wisdom of the cardinal, nothing of the steely intensity and concern of 
Harry Perkins, little of the public Ray McAnally but everything of the 
thoughtful private craftsman McAnally is. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting a British Academy Award for "The Mission," McAnally said, "The 
wonderful thing about acting is that it lets you live other lives, like the 
life of a 17th-Century cardinal." 
</P>
<P>
Over lunch in Santa Monica, McAnally added that "the more seriously you take 
the roles, the more interesting a life you lead. I've operated as a surgeon, 
taken a submarine up and down, been shot, mangled and strangled and died any 
number of times. It's all bound to be good for your breadth of mind, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Rick Pym was a favorite role. "There's something intriguing about watching a 
con man conning," McAnally says. "You want him to get away with it. You see 
through it, of course, and you feel superior to the victim. 'Look at that silly 
fool being taken,' you say." 
</P>
<P>
The Pym character was based on author John le Carre's own father, who went to 
prison for fraud. McAnally met the author only once, at a dinner with BBC brass 
before production began. Le Carre entered the room just as McAnally was 
demonstrating the imposing presence of his fellow Irish actor Michael 
MacLiammoir. McAnally stood and surveyed the room in a commanding and confident 
way. "My God," Le Carre murmured to his host, "it's Rick." It was the first of 
McAnally's good reviews for the role. 
</P>
<P>
"A Very British Coup," financed by Britain's Channel Four, drew enormous 
comment at home. "The conservative press praised the acting, the direction and 
the production," McAnally remarks, "and said it was very good for a vehicle of 
the fantasy type. The opposition press ignored the acting, the direction and 
the production completely and said these matters the plot is about need grave 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally, who feels toward idleness a distaste bordering on revulsion, has done 
three films since "A Very British Coup." Just now he wound up a remake of 
"Great Expectations" for Disney with Jean Simmons and Anthony Hopkins. He has 
played a Scottish fishing boat captain in the Orkneys in "Venus Peter." He has 
been the father of Christie Brown in "My Left Foot," based on the autobiography 
of the man who has created art and literature with the only part of his body he 
could move. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally also played what proved to be the title role in "Jack the Ripper" with 
Michael Caine for television and did a four-month run in the West End as George 
Bernard Shaw in "The Best of Friends," co-starring with John Gielgud and 
Rosemary Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1988, McAnally reckons he did 16 films, three miniseries and a 
half-dozen plays. Now he's been asked to write a book about the Abbey. He 
calculates that he is a member of its third generation, and he'll probably do 
the book to preserve a piece of history that is fading. The Abbey is changing 
because young actors will no longer sign the lifetime contracts that were once 
the standard. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor five-year contracts, nor even contracts for a year," McAnally says. It 
seems a pity to him because the long, intense rehearsals and the runs 
themselves become for the players profound explorations of the characters and 
ultimately of the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing of it is," Ray McAnally says, "that the more truthful you are about 
the interior of yourself, the more universal you are in your meaning to an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
What now remains to be seen is whether McAnally, whose fame is fast increasing, 
can be well known and enigmatic at the same time.

COTTER DISSECTS ORDINARY WITH EYE FOR ABSURD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's more than a trade-off: Comedian Wayne Cotter explores very ordinary, 
everyday topics but brings to the task such singular use of detail and clarity 
of expression -- not to mention a twinkling eye for the absurd -- that he winds 
up with extraordinary pieces of stand-up that you don't hear every day. 
</P>
<P>
And there were other trade-offs evident at his performance Tuesday at the 
Irvine Improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the notable ones was Cotter's way of steering clear of anything too 
personally revealing, rarely opening a window to the darker, more painful side 
of human existence (his or ours). Thus, he misses a chance to function at a 
fully poignant, affecting level, to give his stuff the emotional edge of a Jay 
Leno or an Allan Havey. 
</P>
<P>
He's just working another side of the stand-up street, apparently more 
comfortable operating with the cool precision of a Jerry Seinfeld. And Cotter 
is clearly in the same class as Seinfeld -- not bad as downsides go. 
</P>
<P>
If Cotter is a bit of a dispassionate technician, the upside is that he's an 
engaging performer, exuding a low-key, boyish charm. While his material and 
sensibilities may not provoke a hugely emotional response, you do leave a 
Cotter show feeling quite warm about him. You sense that he's someone you would 
enjoy chatting with over a drink. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you would think that you had already talked with him when you hear 
some of his bits. For example, say you get annoyed at some of the lunkhead 
announcements made on airplanes. That's not unreasonable or uncommon. And 
Cotter knows what you mean. Early in Tuesday's show, he cited one that 
particularly incurs his wrath: "The cabin is pressurized for your comfort." 
Then, he wondered aloud, "Since when is breathing a luxury?" 
</P>
<P>
Or, say you've developed a harmless peccadillo from extensive driving, like 
watching the odometer for significant readings. Cotter has been there too. 
"When those digits all turn the same, is that a big moment for you?" he asked 
the crowd. "I love that . . . three three three three one -- it's coming!" 
Cotter then acted out a scene in which he, overcome with that kind of 
excitement, drives into a ditch and is approached by a rescuer. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuer: "Can I help you?" 
</P>
<P>
Cotter: "Yeah, just push me two-tenths more." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, audience members will connect with some of Cotter's bits and 
anecdotes more than others, depending on the experiences and recollections they 
bring to the proceedings. But, like other first-rate observational 
monologuists, Cotter has crafted material sufficiently universal that the bulk 
of it will strike a responsive chord in any crowd -- and he gives his audience 
credit for being sharp. 
</P>
<P>
During a piece on shopping for back-to-school supplies as a lad, for example, 
he indicated that, for him, this included buying a shiny, new lunch box. His 
clipped recollection went this way: "Seventh grade, first day of junior high. 
New school. I go in with a lunch box; everybody else had a paper bag. I'm 
walking around with the Jetsons under my coat." 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily side-splitting stuff, but a nice sketch of pre-adolescent 
awkwardness. And a lesser -- or less secure -- comic might have mentioned the 
crippling peer pressure and compulsion to conform that's so prevalent at that 
age. Instead, Cotter assumed that the audience would connect those dots, that 
the bit would obey the less-is-more rule. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not as if Cotter merely traffics in frothy frivolity. He does have 
some bones to pick -- and picks them effectively. Take the many numerical 
difficulties facing the average consumer. Revealing that he recently bought a 
new refrigerator, he said, "You know those egg holes in the door? Know how many 
I got? Ten. I come home from the supermarket, (and) I have to eat two eggs 
immediately. They always do this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I got an eight-speed blender. It says on the box 'eight-speed blender.' I get 
it home -- one of the speeds is off. Off is not a speed! . . . Hot dogs (come) 
12 in a package. Buns? Eight. I'm standing in a supermarket trying to figure 
out the lowest common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
He's also more than a little peeved at the way some members of the animal 
kingdom have gotten a bum rap: "I think we have a lot of misconceptions about 
animals. Like they say the mule is a stubborn animal. Do you think the mule is 
really stubborn? What's a mule typically . . . to do? Go out in the hot, 
100-degree desert sun loaded up with boulders. Climb up some craggy incline, 
eating dust all day. The mule's a little reluctant. Yeah, he's a stubborn 
animal. Like the other species would jump at the chance." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate section on pets, however, he suggested that some animals fully 
deserve their less-than-illustrious reputations. "Cats are psychotic," he said. 
"Why do cats always decide suddenly -- for no reason -- they have to be in 
another room urgently?" 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, his voice dripping with contempt, Cotter said, "My brother 
had the worst pet of all. The worst -- a hamster. The thing got sick; he took 
it to the vet! That's like bringing a disposable lighter in for repair." 
</P>
<P>
It's just this kind of pet peeve that makes Cotter stand out at stand-up. 
Headlining an extremely strong bill that also includes Michael Pace (who 
deserves some sort of most-improved award) and Bob Kubota, Cotter continues at 
the Irvine Improv through Sunday..

<P>
MUCH-ACCLAIMED WESTERN SINGER-SONGWRITER VERN GOSDIN FINALLY FINDS POPULARITY 
TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY GLEASON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 54, Vern Gosdin appears to have hit his stride. This year, two of his 
singles -- "Set 'Em Up Joe" and "Will You Believe Me Now?" -- went to the top 
of the country chart, while "Chiselled in Stone," the album that spawned them, 
received a Country Music Assn. nomination as album of the year. Gosdin himself 
was nominated as best male vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has been acclaimed for years by such fellow musicians as Emmylou 
Harris and Merle Haggard, mass acceptance is something new. Gosdin's only 
previous visit to the charts' high side was a brief one, 5 years ago, when the 
tiny Compleat Records released his "I Can Tell by the Way You Dance (You're 
Gonna Love Me Tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
"It's so funny the way things happen," Gosdin, who has been making music since 
the '50s, said with a laugh from his home outside Nashville. "Three years ago, 
right when country music looked like it was going to leave the country, I 
would've never thought I'd be able to get a deal because a lot of labels, 
including CBS (his current record company), didn't seem to be looking for real 
country artists." 
</P>
<P>
Gosdin, who will be opening for George Jones at the Celebrity Theatre in 
Anaheim Saturday night, is as country as country gets. He started singing on 
the Gosdin Family Gospel Show on WVOK radio in Birmingham, Ala. From there, he 
moved to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
When things failed to gel, he moved to Chicago and ran a country nightclub. He 
began honing his bluegrass licks and in 1960 moved to California, where he 
joined his brother, Rex, in a group called the Golden State Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Knocking around California, Gosdin met all sorts of people, including a rather 
serious young bluegrass player named Chris Hillman. Together they formed the 
Hillmen and worked bluegrass festivals around the state -- until Hillman joined 
the Byrds and helped start the folk-rock revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Byrds eventually used one of Gosdin's songs for the "Easy Rider" sound 
track. Vern, though, had no interest in pop. He had grown up listening to the 
Grand Ole Opry on Saturday nights, so that's where his heart lay. He signed 
with Capitol Records. Nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
He moved back to Atlanta, opened a glass business and sang a little on the 
side. Independent record deals came and went, but none could offer the mass 
distribution and exposure needed to get to the charts' upper reaches. 
</P>
<P>
"If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)" threatened to break but didn't. 
Gosdin got back to gospel, with an album called "If Jesus Comes Tomorrow, What 
Then?" And eventually, Bob Montgomery entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery, a producer who had helped the O'Kanes get a record deal, was 
considered a champion of honest country music. "Though we'd met several times, 
we'd never worked with each other," Gosdin recalls. "But we clicked right off." 
</P>
<P>
The result was "Chiselled in Stone." "What's funny is, this is one of the 
lowest-budget records I've ever done," he says. "I think because we had the 
right producer and the pickers, we got into the studio and knew exactly what we 
were doing. We all got together in there, played and had one fun time!" 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the album was released, Gosdin got a phone call from an old pal: 
"George Jones called to tell me he really loved the record. I've known George a 
long time, and I can't begin to tell you how good that felt, because one thing 
about Jones, to get him excited it just about takes an Act of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Gosdin himself continues to lead a quiet life with his wife on their 40 acres. 
And he talks of wanting to do another gospel record when the time is right. 
</P>

<P>
The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares. When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow-cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and 
the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's, in the Disneyland Hotel, 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
778-6600. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Hotel might not immediately spring to mind when the subject of 
restaurants comes up, but it ought to: Granville's, its flagship restaurant, is 
one of the best around. The room is designed for elegance, with mahogany 
sideboards, Regency-style chairs and overwhelming shades of burgundy. Chef Tim 
Owen trained with Boston cooking teacher Madeleine Kamman, and his cuisine is 
original and delicate. Such appetizers as Little Neck clams steamed in Pernod 
with spinach are wonderful, as are such entrees as loin of lamb in an anise 
crust, oven roasted with thyme and rosemary. There is an extensive wine list 
(featuring American wines only), and the service is impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Spats, 901 Civic Center Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 558-1883. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m to 2 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 5 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Spats is one of those maddeningly confusing little restaurants where it is 
impossible to know what you are supposed to be eating. The chef is Japanese. 
The menu is Italian and Japanese. The ambiance is pure California. Best to try 
are the more Japanese dishes like broiled beef on bamboo skewer, fresh oysters 
in the shell with Japanese dipping sauce, and soba, handmade buckwheat noodles 
treated with a simple respect. Avoid the gummy pastas and the pretentious 
Western concoctions. Most of them are better left to the concept stage. There 
is an adjoining disco if you get too impatient waiting for service. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Fish Company, 11061 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (213) 
594-4553. Open Sundays through Thursdays 11 a.m to 10 p.m., Fridays and 
Saturdays until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Order mesquite broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or 
enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore 
tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the 
restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of 
them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart, lemon mousse pie. 
</P>
<P>
Soup Exchange, 151 E. Orangethorpe, Fullerton. (714) 992-5522. Open daily 11:30 
a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Salmagundi, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. (714) 549-9267. Open Mondays 
through Saturdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sundays noon to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Eat soup, live longer at these two emporia for our favorite comfort food. Soup 
Exchange is the slicker and less expensively packaged of the two, a soup and 
salad bar with such extras as frozen yogurt and muffins and a nacho bar to 
boot. It's all you can eat and every man for himself. Salmagundi is homier and 
even a bit trendy, with such exotic soups as tortilla, wild rice and country 
Cheddar; they change daily. Salmagundi also has a dessert bar where you can 
indulge in such goodies as trifle, apple brown betty and chocolate mousse. 
Either restaurant redefines the word excess.

RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON: FROM TRADITIONAL TO EXOTIC, CHAIN PROVES ANYTHING 
CAN BE PIZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Waters first served designer pizza at Berkeley's Chez Panisse Cafe; 
Wolfgang Puck popularized it at Spago. Now it is being mass-marketed with an 
almost evangelical intensity. Gone are the days of having to elbow through 
crowds of celebrities to get at slices of pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, duck 
sausage and herbs that even your grandmother didn't keep around. California 
Pizza Kitchen is seeing nicely to that. 
</P>
<P>
This wildly successful chain has proven to be one of the hottest concept 
restaurants of the '80s. The operative idea behind the range is that anything 
can be pizza. If four people get together and find themselves unable to decide 
between Thai, Chinese, Italian or Mexican food, they can go to California Pizza 
Kitchen and have all four . . . on pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody must like the idea. Just 4 years after it was founded, the chain 
boasts eight stores from Hawaii to Georgia, with plans for several more in such 
faraway places as Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Fashion Island location opened last fall and has been packed 
since day one. And why not? It features all the trappings that made the 
restaurant popular in the first place: the open kitchen; the antiseptic white 
tile motif; the young, good-looking staff, and a menu featuring many of the 
decade's hot, exotic dishes piled atop circular platters of dough. It's the 
kind of place that makes you feel young and foolish -- young when you're in the 
company of all the gorgeous, well-dressed couples; foolish when you're cutting 
into something as absurd as a moo shu chicken calzone. But don't worry; 
traditional cheese pizza is the first item on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
All the pizzas are baked in a specially designed wood-burning oven, which gives 
them a slightly smoky taste that lovers of conventional pizza may not be used 
to. Five-cheese with tomato is one of the best; it comes topped with 
fresh-sliced tomato, basil leaves, buffalo mozzarella, Fontina, smoked Gouda 
and two kinds of Romano cheeses, which all ooze and mingle brilliantly. Goat 
cheese pizza with bacon, red onions and sweet bell pepper also works well -- no 
sensory overload from strange and unnatural combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, much of the menu is, well, non-traditional. How about a Thai chicken 
pizza with spicy ginger-peanut and sesame sauce, green onion, bean sprouts, 
carrots and roasted peanuts? Yarggh. How about Chinese, in the form of a Peking 
duck pizza with mushrooms, slivered green onions and an indiscriminate glob of 
Hoisin sauce? Not much better. And Pritikin? Yes. It's cheese-less with grilled 
eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes and a bag full of shredded spinach -- sort of like 
eating the spray from a lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the original barbecue chicken pizza with cilantro and sliced 
red onion is really delicious. There is a finely textured mozzarella calzone 
with sweet cherry tomatoes, sauteed red and yellow peppers, and a layer of 
salty Fontina for good measure. Vegetarian pizza has a simple, straightforward 
appeal, with broccoli, grilled eggplant, mushrooms and lots of oregano. And the 
two-sausage pizza, perhaps the Kitchen's best marriage of trend and tradition, 
succeeds because of excellent mild and sweet Italian sausages. Pass on the 
average duck and chicken sausage, incidentally. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of salads and pasta dishes are available. For instance, there's a 
well-mixed romaine and watercress salad in balsamic vinaigrette with walnuts 
for crunch and Gorgonzola for sharpness. The mixed-leaf salad in a Caesar 
dressing with fat croutons and shaved Romano is good too. The only salad 
letdown is a boring tuna salad that tastes of nothing more than canned tuna and 
mayo. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta here is not perfect. I sampled three: linguine with a flavorful Bolognese 
sauce, angel hair with a rough tomato-basil concoction, and a nondescript 
garlic cream fettuccine. All were on the gummy side, as if the noodles had not 
been properly rinsed after cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to the many lapses in service I've experienced. Angel-hair 
pasta arrived without the promised goat cheese. I asked the server to put some 
on. And back it came with unappetizing hunks of cheese frazzled to a charred 
tomato-basil coulis. I ordered a bottle of wine at the bar while waiting for my 
table. The bartender was too busy to open it. So how did he solve the problem? 
Simple. He produced a wine opener and wordlessly slid it over to me. But hey, I 
didn't mind. I'm a casual kind of guy. And who knows? It might be the next big 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
California Pizza Kitchen is moderately priced. Salads are $3.50 to $7.50. 
Pastas are $6.95 to $8.50. Pizzas are $5.95 to $8.95.

CROSSING RACIAL BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN WONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would seem that Greg and Amy, both 17 and honors students at Irvine's 
University High School, are a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
They radiate niceness, exuberance and brightness, the very model of 
well-behaved, relatively trouble-free youth. Their friends are much like them 
-- students whose interests range from Disneyland and beach picnics to American 
politics and global technology. 
</P>
<P>
For 2 months now, they have been going steady. But no matter what Amy and Greg 
(not their real names) do, no matter how societally correct they appear, there 
is an inescapable -- and physically obvious -- fact about them as a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Greg is white. Amy is Korean. 
</P>
<P>
And interracial dating in this day and age is still not a matter to be taken 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Interracial dating remains a societal anomaly -- a subject to be approached 
with great caution, a practice admired by some, vilified by others. 
</P>
<P>
True, there are signs that the practice is becoming more acceptable, as 
indicated by the accompanying High Life poll of students at 14 Orange County 
public and private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts in multicultural relations and assimilation argue that 
this kind of relationship, long taboo throughout American society, remains 
light-years from being widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the years of highly publicized integration efforts in housing and 
schools, the greater influxes of ethnic-minority immigrants, and the vanishing 
of anti-miscegenation laws, "I don't think the opposition to (interracial 
couples) has really eroded all that much," says one leading analyst, UCLA 
sociologist Harry Kitano. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids may downplay (racism), but it's out there, as much as ever," says an 
Orange County parent whose son, who is white, is dating a black girl. "If they 
go to a restaurant, and if they hold hands or snuggle a little -- believe me, 
they get the stares, the double takes." 
</P>
<P>
And for most families, the issue of interracial couples, while a far less 
closeted practice these days, remains an intensely private matter. 
</P>
<P>
It helps explain why there are no reliable estimates on the numbers of 
teen-agers in interracial relationships. 
</P>
<P>
However, researchers believe that such interracial dating trends parallel the 
nationwide trends in interracial marriages -- greater visibility, yes, but the 
rates of growth are relatively slow. (Nationally in 1984, according to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, there were 739,000 interracial marriages in which one of the 
partners was white.) 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some growth (in interracial marriages), especially with some 
Asian groups. But overall there hasn't been a real breakthrough, a real 
dramatic increase," says Kitano, a Japanese-American and acting director of 
UCLA's Asian American Studies Center. 
</P>
<P>
And the trend in Orange County, researchers suggest, is probably even less 
prominent, at least statistically, even though the High Life poll suggests that 
interracial couples are becoming a more visible if still small phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a highly conservative county and one that is still 
overwhelmingly Anglo," says multicultural specialist Christine Hall, former 
counseling psychologist at UC Irvine's College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"I question whether this kind of practice can ever really take hold in Orange 
County," says Hall, now an ethnic minorities administrator with the 
Washington-based American Psychological Assn. and herself of mixed black and 
Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
There is still "color" hierarchy at work in reactions to interracial couples. 
</P>
<P>
To white supremacists and other opponents, analysts say, the most taboo 
combination is still black and white, while Asian and white or 
"dark-complexioned" Latino and white are less objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're literally talking color here, the visible gradations," explains Raymond 
Vagas, a Laguna Hills-based marriage therapist, who is of African and Spanish 
descent. "When you're talking 'race' in those terms, you're including 'dark' 
Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, the reasons for entering an interracial relationship, 
counselors say, are exceedingly complex. 
</P>
<P>
It can involve such lofty reasons as multicultural idealism, defiance of 
tradition -- and love. It can also involve fascination with ethnic myths, with 
"opposites" and with protest chic. 
</P>
<P>
But that is one of the problems, says Vagas, whose clientele includes 
interracial couples. "There is this tendency to keep harping on what's 'wrong' 
with these couples." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the issue should be "what's wrong with a society that refuses to accept 
these relationships as normal," says Vagas, a member of Multi-racial Americans 
of Southern California, a newly organized support group of about 200 
interracial or intercultural families. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the parents interviewed for this story argue that this "societal 
labeling" is a key problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of (an intercultural) relationship at their age," says one Anglo 
parent, whose son is dating an Asian, "is that they're so open and fresh now. 
They're not stuck with the labels that society -- and adults -- pin on such 
relations." 
</P>
<P>
Consider a 17-year-old couple in Santa Ana -- we'll call them Deborah and Ken. 
To them, their dating -- she is white, he is black -- is not that startling, 
especially in Santa Ana. After all, the high school population in that city is 
predominantly nonwhite: 72% Latino, 12% Asian, 7% black. 
</P>
<P>
Their backgrounds, other than racial, are notably similar. Both are from 
middle-class families. Both grew up in ethnically mixed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
At their high school, their closest friends are other inter-ethnic couples, 
including Latinos, blacks and Filipinos. Mixed dating "is no big deal," Deborah 
says. "I mean, so many people are doing it, especially at our school." 
</P>
<P>
Ken is "great to be with. We kid a lot, and he's easy to talk with," says 
Deborah, who had previously dated only whites. "He's really nice. He can be 
very serious and thoughtful." 
</P>
<P>
The reactions of parents, of course, are crucial. "We know couples who don't 
dare tell their families," Deborah says. "Not us. Our parents have been real 
supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah's mother says she took the news in stride. Deborah "told me she was 
going out with someone new -- a real neat guy. Then she told me, sort of 
offhanded like, that 'he's black, you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My concern wasn't his color, but whether he was good for her," the mother 
adds. "This is the way I've tried to raise her -- to be a person without 
prejudice, to see past color and cultural differences. This is the way it's 
supposed to be in America, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I have a snapshot now of them," the mother says. "It's always in my wallet. I 
like to show it off. Why not? They're great kids. 
</P>
<P>
"People will look at it, and say, 'My, she's very pretty.' But when they see 
him, they usually say nothing. They just stare." 
</P>
<P>
Amy, the 17-year-old Korean immigrant in Irvine, represents a dramatically new 
ethnic demographic. 
</P>
<P>
Asians are no longer a rarity in that part of south Orange County. Although the 
high school population in Irvine is still overwhelmingly white -- 76% of total 
enrollment -- the number of Asian students has grown significantly, and is now 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Amy and her white boyfriend, Greg, like to say it was good old American 
politics, not some classic East/West encounter, that drew them together. 
</P>
<P>
"We're both interested in politics and we were both Dukakis supporters," 
recalls the tall, personable Greg. With a laugh, he adds, "That makes us a 
minority, all right -- a pair of liberals in Orange County!" 
</P>
<P>
Other factors may have helped. Greg has long shown an eclectic interest in 
things Asian -- particularly ancient philosophers, films directed by Japan's 
Akira Kurosawa and dining at Oriental restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
And Amy, whose family immigrated from South Korea in 1980, has become highly 
Westernized -- her English is virtually unaccented, her dates have always been 
with Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
In the other American regions where her family lived, like Idaho, there were no 
Korean or other Asian communities. So, explains Amy, who can project both 
shyness and vivacity, "if you went out, you dated Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, at first, were not pleased by this. "We were worried because our 
two cultures are so different," says Amy's mother. "Koreans are so traditional; 
Americans are so open, so direct." 
</P>
<P>
But Amy's mother says she no longer harbors such reservations, and Amy herself 
rejects any suggestion that she may be abandoning her Korean heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still respectful of my parents' culture," she says. "I will always be 
part Korean." 
</P>
<P>
Greg describes their bicultural relationship this way: "We're sharing, not 
giving up our cultures. This makes us both more receptive, I think, to real 
differences between us, not just the common bonds." 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, race is not the issue," Greg says. "The issue is that we're 
individuals -- we're persons. I don't see (Amy's) color. I see her." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, he adds: "We wish people didn't always have to bring that issue (race) 
up." 
</P>
<P>
But, intentionally or not, students involved in interracial dating cannot help 
but stand out. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these students resent being considered trailblazers," says Bruce Baron, 
an Irvine Unified School District principal, who developed a study project on 
racial and other inter-ethnic issues, including dating, for the district's high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"But in their own way," he says, "what they're doing is pretty gutsy. Whether 
they like it or not, it puts them right on society's frontiers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, counselors say, the reality of racism is as ominous as ever. And 
interracial couples are often among the choice targets. 
</P>
<P>
It helps explain why several of the families contacted for this story did not 
want to be interviewed at all. Families that agreed did so under the proviso 
that no photographs be taken or actual names used. 
</P>
<P>
Said one of these parents: "We don't hide it. My son's friends know, their 
schoolmates, and a few others." 
</P>
<P>
Citing recent reports of racist-oriented outbreaks in Orange County 
neighborhoods and campuses -- such as a lawn cross-burning and circulation of 
white-supremacy literature -- this parent adds: "But we don't want the whole 
world to know it. Not now. Not with the way things seem to be going." 
</P>
<P>
While those incidents were mostly directed at blacks, state Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp last week noted: "There is an intolerable level of hostility 
against Asian/Pacific Islanders throughout this state, and it has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
However, parents and teen-agers say, racism in Orange County is usually 
subtler, more covert. 
</P>
<P>
There haven't been any "problems," says one black youth, who is dating a white 
girl, "at least not big problems." 
</P>
<P>
"If you mean stares and people saying things to you to your face -- that 
doesn't really happen much," he says. "I mean, if you're cool about it and 
don't go looking for it -- people leave you alone in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he and the other students interviewed tend to treat the question of 
racism -- and the whole matter of interracial dating -- with a studied 
nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
But not some of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my son (who is dating a girl of another race), that he better get used 
to (racist attitudes), and if he doesn't, he had better get out of it," said 
one father. "Because if they decide to stick it out, things could get a lot 
meaner for them."

Nearly 30% fewer permits for multifamily housing units were issued during the 
first 10 months of 1988 than was the case for the comparable period in 1987. 
Many cities, however, showed prominent gains -- foremost among them Tustin, San 
Clemente, Yorba Linda and Huntington Beach. Here is the picture from city to 
city, comparing the first 10 months of 1988 and 1987:

MISTLETOE (Phoradendron flavescens): This semi-parasitic green plant, 
popularized in holiday traditions, occurs as a drooping yellowish evergreen 
bush on the branch of a host tree. The white berries of the plant, consumed by 
fruit-eating birds without ill effect, are poisonous to humans and other 
animals.

SANTIAGO CLUB PROMOTES LATINO CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL PROSPECTS IN 
COUNTY COMMUNITIES 
</P>

Five hundred people were expected, but more than 2,000 showed up. They held 
candles and walked through a grimy Santa Ana neighborhood where the sheen of 
poverty and tough workaday lives was lessened by the glow of candlelight and 
the festive air of the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The walk was Las Posadas, the traditional re-enacting of Mary and Joseph's 
search for a place to stay to await the birth of Jesus Christ. The walkers 
through the Logan neighborhood, north of the Amtrak station, included nearby 
residents and anyone who wanted a closer look at Latino culture. At the end of 
the procession came the fun: mariachis, folk dances and food. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Las Posadas festival last month was sponsored by the Santiago 
Club, a group of almost 100 men and women organized in 1984 "to promote the 
cultural, economic and educational prospects" of county Latinos, according to 
group chairman Rodolfo (Rudy) Montejano. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano, 50 -- a native of Santa Ana with a degree from UC Berkeley's Boalt 
Hall School of Law and a business law practice in Santa Ana -- said the club 
raises and donates money for varied activities, ranging from paying for a 
student's trip to Washington for an internship to pledging $8,000 to pay the 
fees of families applying to become U.S. citizens under the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Club has also helped buy uniforms for some student athletes and 
has worked with schools with large Latino populations to make students aware of 
the many community and 4-year colleges in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Godinez, a club founder who is postmaster of the Santa Ana field 
division of the Postal Service, said club members also hope to act as role 
models for Latinos in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the club broadened its activities, donating the $500 award for the 
best slogan in a Santa Ana voter registration campaign and helping pay for the 
city's decoration of a float entered in the annual Tournament of Roses parade. 
</P>
<P>
The club has an operating budget of more than $150,000 a year, Montejano said, 
charging a $500 initiation fee and $300 annual dues. It raises other funds by 
staging a 3-day Cinco de Mayo festival and a 3-day festival to commemorate 
Mexican independence day in September, both in Centennial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano said the two fiestas are "the largest events of their kind in 
Southern California," with 50,000 or more people attending, dwarfing the 
turnout for similar gatherings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a cultural event, primarily for the low-income Hispanics," he 
said. "It's open to everyone, obviously, but it's primarily . . . a chance for 
(poor Latinos) to bring the family" and have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
For $5 per adult, fiesta-goers get carnival rides and free food, plus a chance 
to buy snacks from booths selling such specialties as tacos and menudo. 
</P>
<P>
The club also raises money by sponsoring a Sunday swap meet known as El Mercado 
at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano said the swap meet not only provides money for his organization but 
more importantly provides "a commercial outlet for customers who otherwise 
would not be able to afford some of these items," which include clothing, toys 
and various kinds of food. 
</P>
<P>
Although the contributions to the Tournament of Roses float and to a Santa Ana 
city celebration mark a widening of the original scope of the club, Montejano 
said, its members are "still concentrating on Hispanic organizations and 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent activity was Las Posadas. Montejano said the Santiago Club 
brought a musical group of college students from Guadalajara to the event and 
distributed 2,500 tamales, 4,000 pan dulces (sweet bread), 3,000 of the thin, 
deep-fried, bread covered with sugar known as bunuelos, and 500 pinatas stuffed 
with candy, cookies and toys. 
</P>
<P>
"You could just see the enjoyment on the children's faces," Montejano said. 
</P>
<P>
Father Jeff Thies, a Roman Catholic priest who is associate pastor of St. 
Joseph's Church in Santa Ana, said Las Posadas "was terrific . . . a major 
event in terms of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Thies' church is also a beneficiary of the Santiago Club, which last year 
contributed a $1,000 cash prize for a raffle as part of St. Joseph's annual 
fiesta, an event that helps raise money to operate the church and its programs. 
</P>
<P>
Montejano said the club's members, who include non-Latinos, are largely 
business people and professionals. He said they include attorneys, engineers, 
restaurant owners, an architect and insurance executives. 
</P>
<P>
One member is Luis Mendoz, born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a veteran of 18 
years as a U.S. merchant sailor, and for the last 5 years a resident of Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoz said he sees the club as a way to "get some money and give it back to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoz said the organization receives several hundred requests for financial 
assistance each year and tries to assist those who are "really going to help 
the community."

What a way to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
With a few molds and some cement, Steve Gagnon started making skulls in his 
Brea back yard about 10 years ago. Every 6 hours or so, he'd place another 
skull on the old shelf in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
Obscurity was part of the business. Aside from a clientele of artists and 
educators, not many knew of his finely crafted replicas. Now, however, one of 
the skulls is a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
Featured in several scenes in the new Sigourney Weaver movie, "Working Girl," 
the saber-toothed tiger skull is part of a line of fossil replicas manufactured 
by Skullduggery in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
What was once a cottage industry run out of Gagnon's back yard has become a 
growing mail-order business managed by the Koehl family, which purchased the 
operation from Gagnon nearly 2 years ago. With the help of museum-donated 
fossils, latex molds and cement, Emmy and Peter Koehl and their son Peter Koehl 
Jr. make and sell 400 skulls a month from their tidy Tustin warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging in price from $85 to $195, Skullduggery pieces include a mountain lion, 
a grizzly bear, a wolf, a 100,000-year-old mammoth tooth and replicas of about 
a dozen other skulls. But the No. 1 favorite is the saber-toothed tiger, made 
from a 12,000-year-old skull dredged from the La Brea Tar Pits. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite, according to the younger Peter, is the human skull -- male 
and female Homo sapiens. But the Homo sapiens with the hole in the head has a 
certain following too. Called the trephined cranium, this skull has a hole 
carved in the top, identical to those carved by surgeons 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Called trephining, the surgery was performed with no anesthesia on ailing 
patients in Europe, Asia, Africa and the New World. According to the 
Skullduggery catalogue, this practice was performed most frequently in Peru, 
where about 60% of the patients survived. The surgeons carved the hole for 
religious or medical reasons, probably to let evil spirits out or nice ones in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt the trephined skull would be great for neurologists," Emmy 
Koehl says. "They could show their patients the difference between ancient 
brain surgery and modern surgery -- to show how far we've come." 
</P>
<P>
Another cranial oddity is the annular deformation skull, cast from a 
500-year-old skull that had been artificially elongated. Like trephining, 
annular deformations were practiced by ancient Peruvians for medical or 
religious reasons. Skulls were bound by tight circular wrappings soon after 
birth so the head would gradually grow elongated. There is no evidence that 
annular deformation had any effect on intelligence, according to Skullduggery. 
</P>
<P>
Emmy Koehl was asked which skull is her favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the saber-tooth because it's unique and dramatic-looking. But my 
favorite is the mountain lion, because it's small and cute. It's less 
foreboding." 
</P>
<P>
Skull replicas used to be found mostly in classrooms and artists' studios, but 
Skullduggery's products have been turning up in living rooms, offices, 
Hollywood movies and museums. 
</P>
<P>
The saber-toothed tiger skull appears in "Working Girl" as an office ornament 
-- its ferocious bite used by the director to artistically emphasize Weaver's 
tough "dog-eat-dog" character in the movie. The skulls can be seen in a more 
benign context at Newport Beach's Museum of Natural History and Science, which 
last year received Skullduggery's entire line as a donation. 
</P>
<P>
(The replicas can also be seen and purchased at the Tustin location, 621 S. B 
St., or through the company's catalogue by calling (800) 3-FOSSIL.) 
</P>
<P>
Made from a gypsum cement that is poured into a latex rubber mold cast from an 
original fossil, the skulls are carefully patched and then finished in one of 
three finishes: natural bone, antique or tar pit. The entire process takes 
about 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Koehl family is able to cast molds from original museum fossils by paying 
royalties for every fossil used. It's a good way to help museums and keep a 
skull-making business going. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship we have with the museums is wonderful, because they always 
have a hard time with income," Emmy Koehl said. "It's a good, symbiotic 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
The Koehl family knew little of skull-making before they became involved in 
Skullduggery. But ancient history held a fascination for Emmy Koehl, who is 
currently taking anthropology courses at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've learned is that there is such a wide discrepancy of ideas on 
how we evolved," she said. "There's so much still to be learned and even the 
experts disagree on a number of things. I think Skullduggery's job is to 
reproduce the physical evidence and let the knowledgeable anthropologists form 
their own theories." 
</P>
<P>
As for father and son, their interest was more entrepreneurial. The elder Peter 
Koehl, a financial consultant, knew the business could be streamlined and made 
profitable. Peter Koehl Jr. is in charge of production. He says the operation 
has been streamlined considerably since the Koehl family took over (Gagnon is 
still part owner, however). 
</P>
<P>
"When we started it would take us 6 hours to make" a skull, said the younger 
Koehl. "Now it takes us 2."

An Associated Press article published Thursday about a change in the U.S. 
government's allocation of refugee quotas contained erroneous numbers. 
President Reagan has decided to increase the quota for the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe by 7,000, to 25,000, according to State Department spokesman 
Charles Redman. The increase will be achieved by shifting 5,500 slots earmarked 
for Vietnamese political prisoners, reducing that quota to 19,500; cutting by 
1,000 the quota for refugees seeking admission from camps in Hong Kong, 
Thailand or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and trimming 500 from the quota for 
refugees from the Near East and South Asia, mostly Afghanistan.

Both the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia and Tass press agency cast doubts 
today on reports that six people had been found buried alive in the devastated 
city of Leninakan 35 days after the Armenian earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television showed an interview Thursday night with 50-year-old 
electrician Aikaz Akopyan who, speaking from his hospital bed, told journalists 
that he and five companions had been pulled out of an apartment block basement 
the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Akopyan, however, none of the other "survivors" had been traced, 
Izvestia said, despite inquiries at all hospitals between Leninakan and the 
Armenian capital, Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
"We journalists find ourselves in a difficult situation. The experience of past 
days has taught us that there is a great, a very great, wish for a miracle," 
Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
It referred to reports last week that 17 people had been found alive 25 days 
after the disaster in the town of Spitak, which was flattened by the Dec. 7 
earthquake. Those reports were later denied by relief workers and local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of the article said they visited the Leninakan street where the 
apartment block was located on the same day the six were said to have been 
pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was two in the afternoon, and the six were found in the morning. Where had 
they gone? Surely someone would have noticed them? Who saved them, after all?" 
they asked, adding that local officials knew nothing about the alleged 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Akopyan, heavily bearded and apparently unable to lift his head from the 
pillow, gave a graphic account of his experience. He related how he and his 
five alleged companions had survived by eating salted food and bottled fruit 
stored in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to imagine that someone in such a severe state would be capable 
of lying," Izvestia said. It quoted a doctor as saying that the man had clearly 
suffered a severe shock to his nervous system, although his memory appeared 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor said Akopyan knew how he had come to be in the basement and talked 
about his work and his family, still apparently unaware that his wife and 
children had been killed in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said it had based its story of the "Leninakan miracle" on a report by the 
Armenian news agency Armenpress. Journalists at Armenpress said they were 
checking the authenticity of the report and trying to find the missing five 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the story had been corroborated by eyewitness accounts but did not 
identify the eyewitnesses. It said it was understandable that people wanted to 
believe in the miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full certainty the 
authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian colleagues about the Leninakan 
miracle. Nor can we deny them."

3 HUNTINGTON BEACH SKINHEADS GET MAXIMUM IN 'GAY-BASHING'

<P>
A judge in Santa Ana today handed three young neo-Nazi skinheads the maximum 
possible sentences in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in a Laguna Beach park 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing the three of a "wolf pack " mentality, Superior Court Judge David H. 
Brickner sentenced Aaron F. Compean, 18, who assaulted the victim with a lead 
pipe, to seven years in prison. John M. Moore, 23, received four years and 
eight months for assault and attempted robbery, and Stephen Walther, 18, was 
sentenced to four years. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, all from Huntington Beach, screamed, "Kill the faggot!" when 
they attacked 48-year-old Robert Joyce. But the jury that convicted them two 
months ago rejected prosecutors' claims that the crime was attempted murder.

BUSH TO TAKE 'HARD LOOK' AT REFUGEE INFLUX INTO U.S.;

President-elect Bush said today he would take "a hard new look" at U.S. 
immigration policies, but he blamed what he called tyranny in leftist-run 
Nicaragua for the influx of refugees from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a brief airport news conference en route to a weekend of fishing in 
the Florida Keys, was asked first what he planned to do about the huge influx 
of refugees overburdening the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
Bush replied that the influx of refugees into Florida and his home state of 
Texas "is causing an overburdening of facilities like schools and hospitals. 
This is a sorry commentary on what's happening in Central America and 
Nicaragua, and we've been seeing this for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
"When I become President, we're going to take a hard new look at the 
immigration policies," he said, "but there is no easy answer to it. 
</P>
<P>
"The final answer is democracy and freedom in Nicaragua. When people are 
fleeing tyranny the United States has to be generous. But no one community can 
suffer an overload without some support." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would do about the refugees already here, Bush replied crisply, 
"The law takes care of that." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a report that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh favors scrapping the 
independent counsel law, Bush said, "I have great confidence in the Justice 
Department under Dick Thornburgh and I will await his recommendation." Bush 
said he still feels "there ought to be equal treatment for the Congress and the 
executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
On another issue, Bush defended offshore oil drilling and said it can be done 
without harming the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Queried as to whether he favors a ban on oil leasing in the Florida Keys, Bush, 
a former Texas oilman, said, "What does that have to do with fishing?" 
</P>
<P>
He went on: "Look, I've pledged two things: One is recognizing that this 
country cannot depend on foreign oil for our national security, but (needs) 
prudent development of our offshore resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I am pledged to see that that is done with total compatibility to our 
marine life and to other environmental considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, aboard Air Force II, Bush told reporters that the fact that his new 
Cabinet is heavily weighted with familiar Washington faces was just what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had promised to bring "new faces" to Washington, but he said: "I never 
pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced Cabinet. There's a lot of new 
faces in the Cabinet. It depends how you define new -- new from the old (Reagan 
Administration) Cabinet, not new from having no experience in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got," said Bush, who 
chose five Cabinet members who had served in the Reagan Cabinet and only three 
people without Washington backgrounds to fill his 17 Cabinet and Cabinet-level 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush promised he would make no news while holed up here at a private 
condominium development until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in why there's such a large traveling press corps here . . . 
when there are so many other awesome journalistic responsibilities," he 
quipped. "Sixty of you have found a way to get down here, and I salute you for 
it."

Tests on rice grown in the United States conducted for a Japanese consumer 
group found levels of pesticides that exceed limits set by Japan, a laboratory 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tests by the Environmental Monitoring Laboratory in Osaka showed that a sample 
of rice from Texas contained 0.16 parts per million of sulfadiazine, while a 
sample of rice from California had 0.11 ppm of malathion, he said. Both states 
have been pressing to sell rice to Japan.

A federal judge today set March 27 for the trial of Southern California defense 
contractor Teledyne and six individuals after they pleaded innocent to bribery 
and conspiracy charges in the Pentagon fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, one defendant tried to dodge reporters by putting on a false 
beard and baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams denied a motion by Teledyne Industries, a 
division of Teledyne Inc., and the six individuals to delay the trial to give 
them more time to examine 250 hours of government wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
Also pleading innocent in connection with the alleged sale of military contract 
data were Navy procurement official Stuart Berlin, business consultants William 
Parkin and Fred Lackner and Teledyne officials George Kaub, Eugene Sullivan and 
Dale Schnittjer. 
</P>
<P>
The judge released each of the defendants on $10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The March trial would be the first in a major two-year investigation of defense 
procurement which federal officials have said could involve up to 50 defense 
consultants, 20 Pentagon employees and more than a dozen major contractors. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Parkin donned a fake beard and a baseball cap and rushed 
away.

KEY NORTH CHARGES THROWN OUT; JUDGE BLAMES ATTY. GEN.

<P>
Federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, blaming Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's 
certification of the potential damage of disclosing national security secrets 
at trial, today dismissed the two central Iran-Contra charges against Oliver L. 
North. 
</P>
<P>
In his bench ruling, Gesell said he had "no factual basis for contesting" the 
Administration's decision to bar independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from 
using classified documents to pursue the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, who had refused to dismiss the two felony counts until he received an 
affidavit from Thornburgh, said he knew of no way for the court to "force the 
attorney general to prosecute a case that the attorney general does not desire 
to prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
North, the former White House aide whose 1986 firing broke open the Iran-Contra 
scandal, still faces 12 criminal counts ranging from obstructing Congress to 
receipt of illegal gratuities, and Gesell made no move to delay his scheduled 
Jan. 31 trial date. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy and theft charges dismissed today, however, focused on the 
central element of the scandal -- North's role in the alleged illegal diversion 
to Nicaraguan Contra rebels of about $14 million in proceeds from the secret 
1985 and 1986 U.S. arms sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh petitioned the court last week to dismiss the two charges when several 
Reagan Cabinet officers, including Thornburgh, refused on national security 
grounds to declassify documents the prosecutor said were vital for him to 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said, however, that because Walsh was describing an Administration 
policy decision, he wanted the attorney general himself to certify that the 
decision was made at the highest levels of government. Walsh and Thornburgh 
each filed declarations with the judge on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell noted at today's hearing that, in passing the 1980 Classified 
Information Procedures Act to ease prosecutions where intelligence information 
is at risk, Congress intended for the attorney general "to balance the policy 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
"In the longer run," Gesell said, "the possibility always exists that a 
freewheeling independent counsel might take a different view of what was in the 
national interest than these other Cabinet officials nominated and confirmed by 
the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
He said of Thornburgh's decision: "The effect is the same as dismissal. The 
court feels it has neither the discretion nor legal authority to do anything 
but to grant the motion." 
</P>
<P>
After dealing with several other pretrial matters, the judge convened a closed 
hearing to explore whether problems involving classified data threaten the 
prosecution of the remaining counts. North's lawyers argue that they will need 
to use much of the same material to defend him against the remaining counts.

'Friday the 13th" computer virus struck personal computers in Britain today, 
wiping out program files and annoying businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was programmed to delete 
files on Friday the 13th, said Alan Solomon, managing director of S &amp; S 
Enterprises, a data recovery center in Chesham. The virus, which might be a new 
species, has been slowing down computers made by IBM and compatible models, 
Solomon said. Telephone lines to the center were busy with calls for help from 
businesses and individuals whose computers were struck by the virus, he said. 
"It has been frisky and hundreds of people, including a large firm with over 
400 computers, have telephoned with their problems," he said.

1ST CONTRACT SINCE FIRINGS;

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IN ACCORD WITH FAA

Air traffic controllers have reached tentative agreement with the Federal 
Aviation Administration on their first union contract since President Reagan 
fired 11,400 controllers in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear victory for both the FAA and the union," said union President R. 
Steve Bell, who predicted easy approval of the agreement by the National Air 
Traffic Controllers Assn.'s 7,000 members. They make up just over half of the 
nationwide controller work force. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and management at FAA, 
in sharp contrast to past problems," said FAA spokesman John G. Leyden. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative contract was signed late Thursday after a third round of talks in 
Baltimore, Md. The negotiations began in Washington in November. 
</P>
<P>
The union won the right to represent the 13,000 controllers in June, 1987. The 
former union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, was forced 
into bankruptcy and decertified after Reagan's mass firings of most of its 
members during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The contract does not cover salaries, which are set by Congress, or any matter 
that would significantly increase cost of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
It covers some working conditions, guaranteeing breaks for employees and 
changes in working positions after every two hours. The controllers monitor and 
control air traffic at about 400 installations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also sets up several committees on safety, technology and other 
matters, a development that union negotiator Elizabeth Thomas of Tamiami, Fla., 
said would give the union more involvement in FAA decision making. 
</P>
<P>
Among provisions are participation of the union in accident investigations that 
involve a controller's actions, immunity for controllers who report 
deficiencies in the system, local and national committees on keeping a safe 
workplace, and evaluation of possibly setting up a program to deal with job 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
Controllers earn between $19,000 and $55,000 a year, depending on experience 
and the number of operations conducted at their assigned facilities.

Belgium, Switzerland and Italy made concerted sales of the currency, dealers 
said.

After the intervention, the dollar traded around 1.8315 marks, slipping about 
one pfennig from session highs. The currency has still risen more than 3% since 
Jan. 1.

The dollar opened sharply higher in New York before retreating on the central 
bank sell-off and news of weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales data, dealers

U.S. ASKS SWISS FOR HELP IN TRIANGLE INVESTIGATION

Swiss government officials said today the United States has asked for their 
assistance in a probe of possible insider trading in Triangle Industries Inc. 
shares in advance of its acquisition last November. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told Switzerland on Dec. 16 that it 
suspected insiders were at work shortly before France's state-owned Pechiney SA 
launched a $1.26-billion bid for Triangle, a major New York-based packaging 
company, in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has frozen an unspecified number of accounts at Swiss 
Volksbank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Banca della Svizzera Italiana and the 
Vaud Cantonal Bank pending a formal request for legal assistance from the SEC, 
a Justice Ministry official said. She declined to identify their owners. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC had alerted France to a tenfold jump in Triangle share trading the week 
before Pechiney's agreed takeover was announced. Pechiney paid $56 a share for 
stock for which French investors had paid around $10.50 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Trade in Triangle totaled 200,000 shares for the three-day period between Nov. 
16 and Nov. 18, whereas normal daily trading in Triangle shares on the New York 
over-the-counter market averaged between 5,000 and 20,000 shares. Pechiney's 
bid was announced on Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
French regulatory officials investigating the case have said more than five but 
less than 10 French operators bought Triangle shares, but have declined to 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Paris banking sources said Triangle buy orders had also been placed through 
Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland on behalf of French investors. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC and officials from its French counterpart, the COB, were to meet in 
Paris to coordinate the expanded investigation of the trading.

However, the agreement, which was subject to completion prior to year end in 
order to garner a lucrative tax break, was nullified when the Federal Trade 
Commission requested more information on the deal, thus preventing completion 
before Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the revised transaction is subject to a definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will increase Pepsico's direct ownership over of its bottlers 
to 49% of total units produced. Combined with other bottlers in which it holds 
a stake, it would have influence over 65% of its volume. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said it is unlikely the FTC will seek to block the sale on 
anti-trust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsico shares fell 75 cents to $38.75 in active trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

General Cinema stock rose $1.875 to $25.875 a share.

Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball may be allowed to change his guilty plea in 
a drunk-driving manslaughter case to safeguard insurance money for victims and 
their families, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea Kimball entered Wednesday could amount to a breach of contract 
and allow his insurance company to cancel a $1.3-million liability insurance 
policy, said Frank Quesada, a lawyer for the 1984 silver medalist. 
</P>
<P>
So Kimball may seek to change his plea to "no contest" before sentencing on 
Jan. 30, Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company could cut Kimball loose," he said. "It has nothing to do with the 
way Bruce feels. . . . A change (in pleas) would be all for the victims." 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe III said he would accept a no-contest 
plea if it's proven his policy would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of testimony about 
the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and injured four others. He said 
he wanted to spare the families the grief of hearing descriptions about how his 
car plowed into the youths on a dead-end road in suburban Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, 25, is being held in Hillsborough County Jail awaiting sentencing.

A University of Oklahoma football player is in custody today and a teammate is 
hospitalized after an early-morning shooting in the athletic dormitory, a 
university spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Parks, 20, a defensive back for the Sooners, was charged with shooting 
with intent to injure, said Cleveland County Dist. Atty. Tully McCoy. The 
charge is a felony that carries punishment of up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Catherine Bishop said lineman Zarak Peters was wounded 
in the early-morning shooting. 
</P>
<P>
After learning of the shooting, football Coach Barry Switzer suspended Parks 
from the football program, and Vice President for Student Affairs Anona Adair 
suspended Parks from the university, according to a statement released by the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Norman Regional Hospital said the wound was to Peters' left 
chest. The bullet is lodged in his rib, said hospital spokeswoman Paula Bowles. 
At this point, doctors do not plan to remove the bullet, she said. He was in 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Parks was booked into the Cleveland County Detention Center on a complaint of 
assault with a dangerous weapon, Bishop said. He was scheduled to appear before 
a judge this afternoon, a jail spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the university's statement, the two students, who attended high 
school together in Houston, were arguing in the athletic dorm early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Following the altercation, Parks left the athletic dorm and retrieved a 
.22-caliber revolver from a vehicle parked outside," the statement said. "He 
returned to Peters' room in the athletic dorm where the shooting took place." 
</P>
<P>
University officials said the reason for the argument was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
The campus Police Department was notified of the shooting at 1:29 a.m., 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Peters and Parks were teammates at Willowridge High School in the Houston area.
