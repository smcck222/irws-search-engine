AL MARTINEZ: ETHICS AS A WAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Al Martinez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The playwright Bertolt Brecht was asked once what he thought about ethics. He 
replied, "Grub first, then ethics." 
</P>
<P>
Grub, for those unfamiliar with Depression-era argot, is a term meaning food, 
such as, "We gotta get us some grub." Then we gotta get us some ethics. 
</P>
<P>
What Brecht was saying in a metaphorical sense was that survival comes before 
morality. You eat first, then pray for the soul of the man you just murdered 
for his pot roast. 
</P>
<P>
I mention this by way of approaching efforts by the L.A. City Council to create 
a code of ethics for itself so that its members will know precisely what they 
can get away with in terms of public impiety. 
</P>
<P>
That's not exactly the way they put it, but that's what it amounts to. 
</P>
<P>
A council committee has adopted an ethics package that would guide the behavior 
of L.A.'s public officials. While possibly commendable, it is not an act of 
high conscience. They did it to head off a citizens' initiative that was even 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
It's a politician's way of promising atonement as a way of avoiding hell. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if approved by the full council and then us voters, would 
prohibit public officials from accepting honoraria (that means money), free 
trips and most gifts from persons other than relatives. 
</P>
<P>
A tie from your sister is OK, a Lamborghini from a bank doing business with the 
city is not. Acting as an adviser for the Hog Institute of Omaha is OK, taking 
money as a consultant for a downtown high-rise construction company is not. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid confusion, an ethics commission will pass judgment on matters relating 
to public morality in individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, of course, there will be a code of conduct for the ethics 
commission so that its members will know precisely what gifts they might accept 
from those upon whom they are passing judgment. 
</P>
<P>
And so ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
Some sort of ethics bible is obviously required for those in positions of 
public responsibility. We seem to consistently elect people who become addled 
about right and wrong in the rarefied atmosphere of power politics. 
</P>
<P>
They'll lead us in prayers and hymns, all right, understanding how much God 
loves a disciple, but go blank when it comes to avoiding temptations of the 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley comes to mind, as he warms in a political frying pan, and 
state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, whose hide is just now beginning to sizzle over 
an open fire. 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, just a heartbeat away from political 
canonization, is being called to account in the scandal involving the collapse 
of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Will it never end? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not, says USC political scientist Sheldon Kamieniecki. Public 
corruption has been going on since the Age of Aristotle and will no doubt 
continue into the hereafter, with angels shuffling for power in the kingdom of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke with Kamieniecki in an effort to overcome my own feelings of scorn and 
cynicism toward the clowns, I mean elected officials, who govern us. 
</P>
<P>
Does a legislator really need a code of ethics to tell him it is immoral and 
indecent to sell his vote or, say, to accept a free trip to sweet places from a 
condom lobbyist trying to persuade him to introduce a safe sex law? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem," said Kamieniecki, "is they figure everyone else is doing it, so 
why not them? They don't put it that way because it makes them look stupid, but 
that's what's in their heads." 
</P>
<P>
He speculates that money and status are among the elements that lure public 
officials into violating public trust. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to live up to a life style the job creates," he said. "If you're 
going to be a leader, you've got to live like one to prove your importance." 
</P>
<P>
Enhancing this concept, according to Kamieniecki, is the growing amount of 
money being paid to sports figures and entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
A congressman sees a kid getting $16 million for his ability to throw a 
football or a rock star earning megabucks for biting off the head of a live 
chicken on stage and thinks, Why not me? 
</P>
<P>
Since balls and chickens are not a part of legislative government, the 
politician seeks other sources of extra revenue, and selling his soul to a 
vested interest seems to be one. 
</P>
<P>
A government code of conduct that embraces pay increases and campaign reforms 
is a good idea for now, Kamieniecki says, but the hope of heaven on earth lies 
in raising everyone's ethical standards and moral values. 
</P>
<P>
By feeding the conscience along with the stomach, we might even create a moral 
imperative that puts ethics on a level of importance almost equaling that of 
grub.

A PROPERLY HARSH ATTACK ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Collegiate Athletic Association's decision to mandate year-round 
random drug testing for steroids puts athletes on notice. Drug use is not 
permissible in athletic competition. The warning and the stiff penalties may 
save some futures. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, approved earlier this week at the NCAA convention in Dallas, 
applies for the first two years to football players at major colleges. That's 
the place to start. Football players are tempted to use anabolic steroids to 
build muscles. As many as 30% of the players on one team used steroids, 
according to a test performed by the NCAA at colleges during the off-season in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new drug-testing policy, a player caught using steroids, or 
substances that mask the performance-enhancing drugs, will lose eligibility for 
one year. A second positive test will result in permanent ineligibility for 
NCAA competition. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty is harsh, but so are the consequences of long-term use of anabolic 
steroids. The damage, according to medical literature, can include 
cardiovascular disease, liver problems and possibly premature death. 
</P>
<P>
The stiffer penalties also apply to street drugs like marijuana and cocaine. If 
the memory of University of Maryland basketball player Len Bias, who died after 
celebrating with cocaine when the Boston Celtics drafted him in 1986, won't 
stop young athletes from experimenting with drugs, perhaps the harsher 
penalties will. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA is sure to face legal challenges before the new policy takes effect 
Aug. 1. Several state courts have ruled against drug testing imposed by 
colleges; testing programs at five Pacific 10 colleges -- Washington, 
Washington State, Oregon, Oregon State, and Stanford -- are already limited by 
legal constraints. But when challenged previously on drug-testing, the NCAA has 
prevailed in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs -- whether steroids or the street variety -- pose a major problem in the 
sporting world. The NCAA's strict new policy recognizes the temptations -- and 
the dangers. The stiff penalties send the right message to talented young men 
and women who sometimes are only too willing to do anything to win.

WHOSE BUDGET IS IT ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be old rhetoric, but there is some truth to the Democrats' claim that 
Gov. George Deukmejian has balanced his 1990-91 budget on the backs of the 
poor, the disabled, the elderly and the sick. In fact, the $1 billion in cuts 
that the Republican governor is proposing in health and welfare programs won't 
just help to balance the budget. The cuts are being used, in effect, to help 
restore the budget reserve to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The governor argues that he is not really cutting the budget, but merely 
holding the rate of increase to within the available state revenues. Otherwise, 
he says, the state would be doomed to annual tax increases just to keep up with 
the cost. Ronald Reagan made much the same claim as governor 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Such contrasting views help illustrate the political complexity of building a 
$54-billion state budget these days. Another way of looking at the budget is 
that there would be plenty of money for health and welfare if only Proposition 
98, enacted two years ago, did not guarantee education more than 40% of the 
state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, everything might be fine if California were to end up with another 
windfall of unexpected tax revenues. But even then the state could not spend 
much of it, because revenues would run into the Gann spending limit enacted by 
voters in 1979. Gann surpluses used to be rebated to taxpayers, but Proposition 
98 diverted such revenues to education instead. 
</P>
<P>
That process would change again if Californians vote in June for a 10-year, 
$18.5-billion state transportation program. The measure also would relax the 
Gann spending limits by a modest amount. If the plan passes, just three weeks 
before the new budget year starts, then the state could indeed use any windfall 
for other state programs such as health and welfare. If the plan fails, 
California will face a crisis because the present state fuel tax is so low it 
will not even keep up with routine maintenance of highways. 
</P>
<P>
In the controversy over health and welfare, Deukmejian is not likely to get the 
reductions he wants anyway, especially the elimination of the cost-of-living 
adjustments that are written into state law. Majority Democrats in the 
Legislature strongly support the inflation increases, as they should. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any good news in the complex budget tangle, it is that the governor 
seems willing to negotiate with lawmakers, as he did last year. Chances are 
good that they will work out some sort of compromise based on the hope that the 
June 5 ballot measure passes. If the transportation/Gann program fails, then 
it's time to panic.

EXPANDING L.A. COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "The Selfish Gang of Five," Jan. 5: 
</P>
<P>
The Times' continued obsession with larger government and higher taxes can be 
best described as "Edsel Economics." 
</P>
<P>
Just at the moment when we are witnessing the communist world's move toward a 
free market orientation and a dismantling of authoritarian government, The 
Times is suggesting that Los Angeles County move toward bigger and more 
centralized government, by expanding the Board of Supervisors and creating a 
strong executive. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding the board is not the best answer. The City of Los Angeles, with its 
15-member council and mayor, has failed to provide adequate municipal services 
for its residents. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Los Angeles Police Department has been deliberately understaffed, 
parts of the inner city are infested by gangs and look like Lebanon. Lack of 
foresight and planning has led to a solid waste crisis, with landfills filled 
to capacity. The city has a severe sewer problem and is being sued by the 
federal Environmental Protection Agency. The streets are not adequately 
cleaned. And yet, the mayor and 15-member council members sit around like Nero, 
fiddling while Rome burns. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are hurt by this liberal philosophy are the middle and lower economic 
classes. The strident wailing for a larger Board of Supervisors would result in 
many millions of dollars being taken from our essential sheriff, fire and 
health budgets to pay for more bureaucrats and bigger government. This mode of 
thinking is reactionary. 
</P>
<P>
Enlarging the Board of Supervisors in order to encourage greater ethnic and 
racial voting is a step backward from our goal of a color-blind society. Just 
as we do not require a religious test for office, we should not require one to 
be of a particular ethnic background to run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
I would venture to say that the County of Los Angeles has a higher ethnic 
diversity in top management than The Times. People of various ethnic 
backgrounds have been candidates for the Board of Supervisors. In fact, The 
Times endorsed Kenneth Hahn over a qualified black candidate, Gil Smith, in a 
recent election. Now The Times is calling for a quota predicated upon race. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is a diverse body, with Protestant, Catholic and 
Jewish members. One member is foreign-born, two others were born outside of 
this state, one is of Hispanic heritage, another is of Slavic heritage. Each 
member has been elected with the active support of our various ethnic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Within the 86 cities, the mayors, city council and school board members are 
comprised of all of our ethnic groups. Within county government we have ethnic 
diversity in management and in our many county commissions.

REBUILDING THE COLISEUM FOR THE L.A. RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor of Los Angeles has formed a committee of businessmen and others to 
keep professional football in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The other California cities have gotten the bidding for a sports franchise into 
the $200-million range, and the end is apparently not in sight. The enlightened 
civil leaders seem hellbent on providing an area for a handful of athletes 
while muddling about on what steps to take to provide adequate housing for the 
working poor. Let the games begin.

EXPANDING L.A. COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must respectfully take issue with some of the points raised in your 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has long supported expansion of the five-member Board of Supervisors 
and election of a county executive; so have Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and I, and 
we signed the ballot arguments for proposed county charter amendments to 
accomplish that in 1976 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has called upon the board to settle the case out of court and spare 
county taxpayers the time and expense of a protracted trial; so have Supervisor 
Hahn and myself. 
</P>
<P>
We have made every effort to persuade a majority of our colleagues to this 
position. In this light, I believe it is both unfair and inaccurate to ignore a 
significant difference of opinion on policy, strategy and tactics among the 
board's membership and lump us all together.

UNLEASHED DOGS AND POSTMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The postman has a right to protect himself. If he had killed the dog in any 
other manner would it be an issue today? No! 
</P>
<P>
As an ex-animal control officer with 10 years experience, I have witnessed and 
investigated many dogs and their owners for violations of vicious dog attacks. 
Most dog owners will not admit their dog is vicious or comply with any 
provisions of the law that would protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
No one has raised the question as to what the dog was doing out in front of the 
property with no fence or proper restraint (leash). The dog owner was just as 
much at fault for not complying with the provisions of the Municipal Code, 
which protect the public as well as the animals from harm. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that the young boy had to witness the act, but if he had 
witnessed the dog get run over by a car he would have suffered the same trauma. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with all our public servants becoming easy prey for drug users to rob 
and hurt and all the dog owners who allow their dogs to run the streets, you 
cannot blame the postman or any other public servant for taking a precaution he 
felt necessary for protecting life and limb.

BRADLEY CHOOSES ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH and LARRY STAMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday appointed Lillian Kawasaki, a Los Angeles Harbor 
Department employee, to head the city's new Department of Environmental 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki, 39, is the first Asian-American department chief in the city's 
history, Bradley said. Kawasaki, of Fountain Valley, has worked for the Harbor 
Department since 1978, beginning as a port environmental scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The department, created last spring over Bradley's opposition, will have an 
initial annual budget of $1 million and a staff of 20. Kawasaki's salary will 
be $82,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley opposed creation of the department out of fear it would set off turf 
wars between departments, many of which have some responsibility for 
environmental matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Friday that Kawasaki will be the city's "principal educator" on 
environmental matters. "We hope to have her deliver the message to the public 
so that they will get involved in the efforts of the 1990s as we engage in a 
vigorous environmental program in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"She has worked with many of the city agencies and that is going to be one of 
her assignments," Bradley said. "We hope that this cooperative effort is going 
to give us the best attack on the problems that confront us." 
</P>
<P>
She will be the first Asian-American to be appointed general manager of a 
department, although others have served as acting bureau heads, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki is not well-known among environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sulnick, executive director of the American Oceans Campaign who strongly 
endorsed creation of the new city office, said he was not familiar with 
Kawasaki. He said he had hoped that a well-known environmentalist would be 
named to the post. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us were asked or included in the process that I'm aware of," Sulnick 
said. "But, I'm not trying to be negative. This may be a wonderful appointment. 
I simply don't know, but I have great hope for the agency." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Nichols, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council offices 
in Los Angeles, said, "She's as good a choice as you could have found within 
the city family." Nichols said Kawasaki was picked from among several 
candidates "based on her abilities as an environmental manager, as opposed to 
being an environmental advocate." Nichols agreed that few in the environmental 
movement know much about Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said the city Harbor Department appears to have avoided environmental 
suits and been more sensitive to environmental concerns since Kawasaki was 
named director of environmental management for the port in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In that job she focused on the impact harbor activities have on air and ocean 
water quality as well as the surrounding land area, according to the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, she has managed the environmental program relating to 
the Harbor Department's expansion, including plans to mitigate the effects of 
expansion on wetlands areas. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said the new department will coordinate city environmental measures 
and "guide, support and really strengthen the city commitment to improving the 
citizens' quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of very good efforts under way to address our environmental 
quality," she said. "This department is not meant to duplicate them, they're 
meant to enhance them. 
</P>
<P>
She said she does not know whether her department will be involved in policing 
other departments. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki has a BS degree in zoology and an MS degree in biology from Cal State 
Los Angeles.

QUERY BY MCMARTIN JURY HINTS AT SOME GUILTY VERDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial adjourned for a three-day 
weekend Friday without reaching final verdicts, but not before asking the judge 
a question which, in its phrasing, seemed to indicate guilty verdicts on at 
least some counts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they have reached decisions on 52 counts -- the same number lodged 
against defendant Ray Buckey. The counts involve all 11 children named in the 
criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
They have 13 counts left to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, is charged with 12 counts, involving 
four children who attended the family-run nursery school she directed in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining charge is a shared count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, in writing, asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders 
whether it is possible for them to find one defendant guilty and the other not 
guilty of conspiracy, since both are named in the single count. Four verdict 
forms were provided them for the conspiracy count. 
</P>
<P>
The answer would appear to be yes, depending on which, if any, allegations 
contained in the conspiracy count the panel finds to be true. Defense 
attorneys, however, asked to discuss the matter with Pounders before he gives 
the jurors a formal answer when deliberations resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
The acts of conspiracy contained in the single count include allegations that 
Peggy Buckey required parents to notify her what time they planned to pick up 
their children and prohibited parents from coming to the school during certain 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy count also accuses Ray Buckey of telling the children to play a 
game called "lookout," in which they watched for approaching parents. And it 
alleges that Ray and Peggy Buckey together played "naked games" with children, 
photographed naked children, transported children off the school premises, and 
threatened them with death. 
</P>
<P>
The jury had been expected to conclude its work by Friday. However, it left 
early Thursday because of the illness of one juror's child, and recessed at 
noon Friday because another juror had a doctor's appointment.

AUTO REPAIR SHOP TEACHERS RECRUIT STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: INSTRUCTORS IN ADULT EDUCATION CAR-REPAIR CLASSES ARE GIVING THE HARD 
SELL TO POTENTIAL STUDENTS. THEIR JOBS MAY DEPEND ON THEIR SALESMANSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
Inside a white tent at the Convention Center Auto Show, tucked between the 
bumper sticker peddlers and the fellows hawking polishing cloths, Ben Avila 
hands out flyers touting one of the day's best deals -- low-cost training to 
launch a career in auto repair. 
</P>
<P>
Avila teaches automotive repair in the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
adult education program, but he sometimes feels more like a salesman than an 
instructor, as he tries to keep his classes full. 
</P>
<P>
"Our jobs depend on having enough students for our classes," he said, "so here 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
Avila and his fellow automotive teachers from the district's 11 occupational 
training centers have taken turns manning a booth at the Auto Show this week in 
a novel attempt to spread the word about the classes they teach. 
</P>
<P>
"This (adult education) is a small division that depends on enrollment, and the 
teachers have the responsibility to keep the enrollment up," said Avila, who, 
along with his colleagues, works for the district under a six-month contract. 
</P>
<P>
When a class drops below about 12 students, the district closes it and the 
instructor is out of a job, Avila said. "So you either try to get two or three 
part-time (teaching) jobs to make a living, or you do what you have to to keep 
your class open." 
</P>
<P>
For some teachers, that means phoning class dropouts to try to entice them to 
re-enroll, or visiting local high schools to promote their classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one guy who used to pass out flyers advertising his class on the 
weekends," Avila said. "He'd go to parking lots with his wife and kids, and 
they'd hand out flyers to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the teachers have stumped at the Auto Show, which ends 
Sunday and is expected to draw a half-million visitors from around Southern 
California to see the latest in automotive technology and design. 
</P>
<P>
Their booth, donated by Auto Show management, features a cutaway of a car 
engine -- also donated -- and a video, by Avila, of classroom scenes from the 
automotive program. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured this was a place to get people who might have an interest in 
learning automotive repair," Avila said. So far, only a few people have signed 
up for the classes, but the teachers are hoping that visitors to the show will 
take the information back to their family, friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The automotive program is one of a variety of classes offered by the district's 
adult education division, ranging from electronics and computer science to home 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
The entry-level classes are free to high school students and dropouts and cost 
less than $50 a semester to others. Students can enter the classes at any time 
during a semester, and upon completion, the instructors help them to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the district's adult education classes are not hurting for enrollment, 
said Harlan Barbanell, who heads the adult education division. "Business is 
good. . . . We run classes all day and most evenings, 12 to 14 hours a day. 
Most have Saturday classes too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But enrollment in the automotive program has been "decreasing drastically" in 
recent years, said teacher adviser Blas Hernandez, partly because the field has 
become more technically complicated and computer-oriented, requiring better 
reading, writing and computation skills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little frightening for some students to go in there and realize 
that you're not just going to twist nuts and bolts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers are all professional auto mechanics who have completed two years 
of a college program that enabled them to earn adult education teaching 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a good job of keeping our students," Avila said. The dropout rate for 
his six-hour class last semester was 17% -- compared to the district's high 
school dropout rate of almost 40%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got to get the word out about what we offer. It's our self-interest, 
but it's more for the people who benefit from these classes. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are here trying to change their lives. Some of them come in wearing 
the same shirt every day for a year, but they come. There's something about 
seeing that kind of motivation that makes it worthwhile."

MAYOR PICKS 2 FOR REDEVELOPMENT BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: APPOINTMENTS MAY SIGNAL CHANGE AT CRA, WITH LESS EMPHASIS ON 
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MORE ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In what is seen by many City Hall observers as a major shift in the direction 
of the Community Redevelopment Agency, Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday appointed 
two new members to its board, including a prominent public interest attorney 
who is expected to advocate vastly increased attention to the poor and less to 
high-rise development. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle Hall, founder of the Center for Law in the Public Interest, and Larry 
Kirk, general manager of the Los Angeles Hilton and Towers, will join the 
seven-member board as soon as they are confirmed by the City Council as 
expected, the mayor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in a statement, said Hall will play a key role in his plan to shift 
the CRA's emphasis from commercial development to social programs in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Hall will join Bradley's two-year effort to raise the CRA's 
legal spending limit of public funds from $750 million to $5 billion. Approval 
of the controversial 20-year spending plan is the Bradley Administration's 
single biggest goal, said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and Kirk will replace two board members who recently resigned their posts 
midterm, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Daniel Horwitz, founder of a Century City mortgage brokerage company, 
was asked by Bradley to accept a new position on the city's telecommunications 
commission. Edwin W. Steidle, a prominent retailer, voluntarily resigned to 
pursue personal interests, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
One well-connected downtown lobbyist who asked not to be named said Hall's 
appointment is part of a snowballing effort to "force the redevelopment agency 
to reassess its role in the city, and turn its efforts to homelessness, 
affordable housing, child care and all the other pressing needs." 
</P>
<P>
The agency has come under steady fire by critics, including many members of the 
City Council, who have accused its board of emphasizing too much high-rise 
development while remaining aloof from the needs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, now in private practice on public interest and environmental issues, was 
hired by the city in 1988 to work with angry citizen groups who object to 
Bradley's proposed downtown spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
The poverty groups, housing interests and others have demanded that most of the 
proposed $5 billion be spent on affordable rental housing, child-care programs 
and other services. Bradley has proposed that half the money go to such needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary that the agency begin focusing much of its attention on 
the problems of Skid Row, homelessness, families in poverty and other urgent 
needs," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that if the spending limit for downtown is raised -- a plan that needs 
the approval of Los Angeles County officials and the City Council -- "the kinds 
of changes I am talking about will become inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, one of the agency's fiercest critics, said he 
hoped the two appointments "will represent a change in direction for the CRA." 
</P>
<P>
However, Yaroslavsky said that as long as CRA Chairman Jim Wood runs the board, 
"then I'm skeptical about whether the tough decisions that need to be made are 
going to be made. I think the problem with the agency is with the chairman, and 
the person who is chairman of that board and has been for, what, a decade now, 
has to take responsibility for the agency." 
</P>
<P>
Wood, in a telephone interview, said he did not want to respond to 
Yaroslavsky's criticism, but said of the new appointments, "I feel very good 
about what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anybody that's more knowledgeable about redevelopment 
and its scope than Carlyle Hall," Wood said. Of Kirk, he said: "One of the 
things that we're all concerned about is a balanced downtown and a 24-hour city 
with residential, retail stores, and a grocery store indeed would be nice. So 
he will be very helpful to us." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Garcia, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist who clashed with the CRA many times 
as former head of the city Planning Commission, expressed optimism over the 
appointments. He said it will be "a challenge for the agency to show it can 
change some of its behavior. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who knows Carlyle (Hall) will know he won't be a passive member of the 
board, and frankly from what I have heard of Kirk, he will not be a yes-man 
either," Garcia added. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that Kirk, 48, a longtime hotelier and a member of the executive 
committee of the Central City Assn. of downtown businesses, will take a lead 
role in streamlining the bureaucracy of the agency, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly am not going into (the CRA appointment) with a so-called planned 
agenda," Kirk said. "I both work downtown and live downtown, so I obviously 
have a strong sensitivity to this entire downtown situation."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP FILES PETITIONS TO RECALL COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group seeking to oust Pomona Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant from office has 
filed recall petitions it says contain more than 11,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elizabeth Villarel said a recall election will be called if the 
verification process shows that at least 8,304 registered voters signed the 
petitions, filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the recall committee contend that Bryant uses his office "for 
vicious personal attacks and character assassination." The petitions accuse 
Bryant of failing to provide responsible representation, and chide him for 
calling his opponents "idiots," "nobodies" and "liars." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 69, who has served 11 years on the council, said that if there is a 
recall election, he won't bother to campaign because his record is well known. 
"I have faith in the people of Pomona, he said."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 130 FIREFIGHTERS CALLED TO $6-MILLION BLAZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fire raced through a North Hollywood commercial building Friday, causing an 
estimated $6 million in damage and destroying two businesses, the Los Angeles 
Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, although six employees of an adult video company fled 
the building when the fire was discovered, officials said. The cause of the 
blaze remained under investigation but appeared to be accidental. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 firefighters controlled the fire in about an hour. Although the 
outside walls of the approximate 20,000-square-foot building remained standing, 
officials said the interior was gutted by the fire, which had also burned 
through the roof.

AN ACTOR-FRIENDLY 'UNCLE VANYA' AT OLD GLOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director Jack O'Brien's notes in the program for "Uncle Vanya" at the Old Globe 
go on at length about returning the theater to its actors -- getting it away 
from technical effect. 
</P>
<P>
It is a plea for purity. A cry for a return to basics. Technical wizardry has 
its place (as in the late John Hirsch's wizardly "Coriolanus" two seasons ago), 
but what O'Brien wants is power for the people: a theater that depends on the 
wizardry created by its actors. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve this takes actors plus. It takes a director who loves and knows 
them, a playwright who can smile at the contradictions of the human heart. Call 
him Chekhov. Put it all together. Spell it "Uncle Vanya." And there you have 
it: vulnerable and unadulterated. 
</P>
<P>
"Vanya" is a difficult play. A shadowy, rich, elusive play full of melancholia 
and stillness and anger and explosion. In short, classic Chekhov, complete with 
country estate a million miles from anywhere, inhabited by isolated souls dying 
of boredom and yearning. 
</P>
<P>
Owner of the spread is Serebryakov (Richard Kneeland), aging pedant and 
self-centered professor married to the languid, willowy Yelena (Carolyn 
McCormick), not much older than his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Plain-Jane daughter Sonya (Lynne Griffin) and her uncle Vanya (Richard Easton), 
brother to her mother, run the estate, which is variously inhabited by Vanya's 
mother (Patricia Fraser), the old nursemaid, Marina (Katherine McGrath) and old 
serf Telegin (Jonathan McMurtry). 
</P>
<P>
The Chekhovian alter ego here is Astrov (Byron Jennings), the drop-in doctor, 
sentimental realist and some time poseur. Sonya loves Astrov. Astrov loves 
Yelena. Vanya loves Yelena. Yelena doesn't know who she loves. 
</P>
<P>
This revolving landscape is as pockmarked as old Telegin's face with tell-tale 
exclamation. "Within this tomb . . . surrounded by fools," sniffs the 
insupportable Serebryakov. "The time I let slip through my fingers!" wails 
idle, unhappy Vanya. "I don't like people," Astrov growls flatly. "If you knew 
how miserable I feel," says . . . well, practically everyone. "September 
already; how are we going to get through the winter?," moans the anguished 
Yelena, voicing what's on everybody's mind. You have to laugh. And you do. 
</P>
<P>
These are the clues, signposts in the mine field of human relations. O'Brien 
creeps up on his script. Things move slowly at first, only taking flight in the 
confrontational scene between Sonya and Yelena, who iron out their differences 
by trading confidences and dissolving into tears for entirely different 
reasons. "I'm so happy," exclaims Sonya, weeping, as the women unhappily 
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
The production is rich in such specific and contradictory detail. O'Brien has 
chosen to place his actors -- as promised -- center stage in dim, often 
unilateral light (designed by Peter Maradudin), on a confining partial set (by 
Hugh Landwehr). Its atmosphere is deliberately claustrophobic. A boxing ring of 
the emotions. Oddments of furniture litter the edges of stage. And actors 
wander in and out, on and off, sometimes altering costume in full view of the 
audience, the mechanics of their trade exposed -- the better to impress us with 
their leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
In all major respects, this is a carefully modulated, fragile staging, sad and 
ludicrous at once, a paradox of delicacy and clumsiness, with Jennings turning 
in an astringent Astrov, pickled in vodka yet capable, when sober, of the 
emotional transports of a child (as in the map scene). His exchanges with the 
wavering McCormick are delightful, as much thanks to his sudden boyish 
flounderings as to the unexpected humor in her wan, expertly timed responses -- 
and to the erotic undercurrents that travel between them. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the cast is commendable, from Kneeland's overbearing Serebryakov, 
to Griffin's beautifully etched, thanklessly earnest Sonya (though McMurtry, in 
excessive makeup, is too fine an actor to waste as the peripheral Telegin). But 
it is Easton, in the tile role, who takes it away. His Vanya is a tortured, 
blundering wreck, an emotional powder keg on a fuse, waiting to ignite. 
</P>
<P>
His explosion is bewildering, but the performance will live in the memory for 
another, subtler reason: When he enters the room with flowers for Yelena and 
finds her in Astrov's arms. Easton drops the flowers, pulls off his glasses and 
dashes them to the ground, as if the sight had turned them to fire and they 
were searing his flesh. 
</P>
<P>
That's an actor's moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a theater of words and imagination -- and that is the province, the 
sole province of the actor," O'Brien wrote in the "Vanya" program. He wasn't 
kidding.

FACES . . . : ALBUM NO BIG PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Best known for his wildly mannered performances in the films "Back to the 
Future," and "River's Edge," 25-year-old actor Crispin Glover puts another 
feather in his cap this month with the release of his debut album, "The Big 
Problem." Produced by L.A. musical duo Barnes &amp; Barnes, the record is 
loosely drawn from Glover's writings (he's written 23 handmade books and is at 
work on a new one). 
</P>
<P>
"This record is based on a concept called the big problem," explains Glover. 
"All the lyrics point towards what the big problem is and the listener's job is 
to figure out what it is. There's a phone number on the record jacket and so 
far three people have called with the correct answer -- which made me very 
happy. That indicates that the record actually made sense to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
A congenial, well scrubbed young man, Glover confesses, "It's never been a 
dream of mine to do a record, but I've enjoyed doing this." Two years in the 
making, the record includes a version of "The Daring Young Man on the Flying 
Trapeze," a rap anthem and spoken word musical poems. 
</P>
<P>
Soon to be seen in the John Boorman film "Where the Heart Is" and David Lynch's 
"Wild at Heart," Glover has earned a reputation as being quite a handful (he 
has the dubious distinction of being the only guest ever to be thrown off "The 
David Letterman Show"). He's aware of his image, but isn't particularly 
distressed about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to worry about that," he says. "A few years ago I was trying to put 
across a certain image -- an eccentric artist with a little insanity thrown in 
-- but I'm not interested in perpetuating that. Not because I'm afraid it will 
scare people off, but because it's a lot of work keeping an image up. As to 
whether I think of myself as an eccentric artist, I don't mind that 
description, but I think the insanity part is a bit false." KRISTINE McKENNA

THE DECLINE OF DAN RATHER'S RATINGS AFTER THE BUSH INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Du Brow's Jan. 6 article on the decline of Dan Rather's ratings after his 
1988 interview with then-candidate George Bush didn't quite tell it all: Rather 
and his team of Bush haters such as Lesley Stahl and Bob Schieffer have carried 
on the vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
When Gen. Manuel Noriega was captured, Rather spent the last 10 minutes of his 
show in a memorial to the dead in Panama, American and local, and a discussion 
of all the bad things that occurred in Panama with not one statement of the 
good things that came out of the U.S. action. This was the most biased, 
dishonest type of reporting, and Rather was not criticized in the print medium 
about doing it.

THE DECLINE OF DAN RATHER'S RATINGS AFTER THE BUSH INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bush's 1988 attack on Rather was in the same execrable taste as his 
presidential campaign. Rather, after all, was not running for office, and his 
walking off a TV broadcast set (an act pointed out by Bush) is not comparable 
to lying or backing illegal and immoral activities. 
</P>
<P>
Rather is not a news announcer -- he is a reporter, and a reporter's job is to 
get to the truth. Unfortunately, many people can't stand truth when it hammers 
on their petrified beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Some viewers may be alienated by Rather's deadpan (yet dramatic) style that 
calls attention to program content, not to himself. This is in the best 
tradition of TV journalism reverberating from Edward R. Murrow. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers who abandoned Rather because he "abused" Bush forget that the role of 
the press in a free society is to probe events, even when it embarrasses 
government officials, and in so doing serve as the watchdog of democracy and 
the conscience of government.

My fear is that the Peter Jenningses and other very-nice-guys will get such 
high ratings that CBS will want to dilute Rather's aggressive reporting and 
anchoring.

FACES . . . : 'SKI PATROL' VIA POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY JANEL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her native Poland, Tess Foltyn "dreamed in brown and gray." 
</P>
<P>
"You do, because it's such a low-key and very sad life over there," said the 
model-cum-actress who prefers using just her first name and makes her movie 
debut in the new dopes-on-the-slopes comedy "Ski Patrol." 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a big potato. I'm a small potato yet," she says, "but I'm living in 
the ultimate country in the world, and I am happy." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Oswiecim (Auschwitz), she grew up in a well-to-do household. She was 
trained in music and studied in Vienna, where she was when martial law was 
declared in Poland in 1981. She sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
Getting an American visa took months. "I had no money," she recalls, "because I 
could only take out with me about $150 to pay for my education. I was a bum on 
the street for a while. I could only communicate with my parents by the mail, 
and this was censored. It was a very depressing time." 
</P>
<P>
She worked different jobs before distant relatives in the United States agreed 
to sponsor her. She settled first in New York, where a friend got her to try 
modeling. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, beautiful is Grace Kelly," she says. "I have this hard face, like a 
female Arnold Schwarzenegger. Besides, I was an ugly kid and a late bloomer, so 
I felt very insecure about it." 
</P>
<P>
She made the agency rounds anyway. At 5-foot-8, she was told she was too short 
to work in New York. That prompted her move to Los Angeles two years ago, where 
her modeling career took off. She broke into commercials with a Miller beer 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
She also started doing stand-up comedy and auditioning for film and TV parts. 
"Either my accent was no good or my face was too overwhelming, or they wanted 
me to take off my clothes. . . . I come from a Catholic family and my parents 
would probably die if I did. And the notorious couch castings and all? I'm not 
into that." STACY JANEL SMITH

MOVIES WITH HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A response to Sheila Benson's Dec. 22 review of "Always": 
</P>
<P>
In what has to be the darkest slate of holiday movies ever, Benson ironically 
implies that hell may be realized by seeing the movie "Always." 
</P>
<P>
I too gaze in horror at Oliver Stone's nightmare vision of Vietnam, and the 
Holocaust is something that should never be forgotten, but I also mourn the 
certain death of sentimentality and heart in today's movies. 
</P>
<P>
When critics consider the only serious directors to be those who bludgeon us 
with the pain and torture of man's inhumanity to man, then those who choose to 
show life as a more uplifting and joyous experience become a rare and 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
As with most movies, "Always" is not perfect, but it tries very hard and 
succeeds where it counts most. It tells a positive and entertaining story, one 
that doesn't make us feel guilty to be part of the human race.

NELSON AND KRISTOFFERSON DRAW A 'PAIR OF ACES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gritty Willie Nelson and flinty Kris Kristofferson are the entitled "Pair of 
Aces" in the CBS Sunday movie (8-10 p.m.). But the story is so lame and languid 
that only staunch fans of the stars will find reason to keep tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's down-home con man and Kristofferson's sturdy Texas Ranger are 
reluctant comrades in the manhunt for a serial killer of high school 
cheerleaders. That may sound lurid, but don't be deceived. The biggest thrill 
in this show is watching Nelson slip out of handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
As a team hitched together like a ball and chain, the stars do rub off well 
together, rumbling around the scenic woods and farmlands outside Austin, where 
the film was shot. But the only excuse for this movie is the gnarly byplay 
between ol' Willie and Kris. The plot lacks any other redeeming quality, and 
that includes supporting actor Rip Torn, in a throwaway parody of a crusty 
retired Ranger that Torn phones in. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches in the script by Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright abound: among them, a 
couple of cackling yahoos in a pickup, a pool hall full of rough bikers, a 
corruptible D.A., a rebellious daughter -- even, in the movie's most dismaying 
moment, a bunch of rangers at an outdoor barbecue sitting around singing songs 
in the twilight, like an outtake from an Autry Western. 
</P>
<P>
One moment, however, is indeed genuine. It occurs when the grizzled Nelson 
takes Kristofferson's older, troubled daughter (Jane Cameron) and endearingly 
whirls her around the room to a dance record. Director Aaron Lipstadt earns at 
least half a stripe right there. RAY LOYND

'DEGRASSI HIGH,' 'WONDERWORKS' RETURN TO PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two award-winning series for young teens make a welcome return to PBS this 
weekend -- "Degrassi High" and "Wonderworks." 
</P>
<P>
In a special one-hour premiere at 6 p.m. Sunday on Channel 28, "Degrassi High" 
takes up where two seasons of "Degrassi Junior High" left off. Still proving 
itself one of the gutsiest series on television, the show, which previously has 
addressed alcoholism, homosexuality and racism, takes on the issue of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Last season ended with the junior high school burning down, but Spike, Wheels, 
the twins Erica and Heather, Snake and the whole gang are now ninth- and 
10th-graders, adjusting to life in a new, big-city high school. 
</P>
<P>
While the new students are going through an unofficial, relatively lighthearted 
"initiation" at the hands of older students, Erica is dealing with the 
discovery that, at age 16, she's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows but her sister. Their religion says abortion is wrong and they 
have both taken strong anti-abortion stands in the past. Heather calls clinics 
"killing centers." 
</P>
<P>
A classroom discussion of abortion, talks with unwed mother Spike and with a 
clinic counselor, give both sides of the issue passion and weight. It is clear 
that whatever Erica decides will change her life. 
</P>
<P>
That's the strength of this funny/serious series. What happens to each 
character will be referred to in the future -- there's no sitcom amnesia at 
work. When parents divorce, when illnesses, failures and successes happen, the 
kids of Degrassi are affected, change and grow like real people. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderworks" makes a lower key return with "Sweet 15," a predictable but 
well-acted drama about a Mexican-American girl's coming of age. (It airs today 
at 8 p.m. on Channel 15 and Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 28.) 
</P>
<P>
Marta Delacruz (Karla Montana) is looking forward to her 15th birthday Mass and 
celebration that will publicly mark her entry into womanhood. The party will be 
costly, but Dad (Tony Plana) is a proud, successful man, living his American 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
But Dad has a secret that threatens their security. He is not an American 
citizen. Working as a volunteer in her church's Amnesty office, Marta discovers 
his secret when she comes across his citizenship application. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Weil's script traces Marta's path out of childhood as she helps her 
father gain his citizenship and gains her own understanding of the hardships he 
has endured to give his family a future. 
</P>
<P>
The telling could be shorter (Part 2 of the two-hour drama airs next weekend), 
but Montana, Plana, Jenny Gago as Marta's mother, Panchito Gomez as the 
handsome older boy who earns his way into Marta's heart, and guest stars Susan 
Ruttan, Jerry Stiller and Liz Torres work as a smooth ensemble to make it all 
worthwhile. LYNNE HEFFLEY

PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING;

<P>
EURYOPS PECTINATUS: EURYOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evergreen shrub with bright yellow flowers 
</P>
<P>
The name may not be familiar, but the plant is: Lacy gray-green leaves on 
shrubby 4- to 6-feet multiple stems are radiant with daisylike flowers -- in 
the winter, when we really need them. The flowers have short (about 6-inch) 
thin stalks and don't last long in bouquets, but they last a very long time in 
the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Dependable color isn't the only attraction in this heroic but unsung shrub: 
Euryops, planted in full sun with good drainage and nurtured through its first 
season, needs little if any watering. With minor pruning every summer, euryops 
will stay bushy and healthy with generous, dependable flowering. Like any 
flowering plant, though, euryops' blooms should be removed when they start to 
wither. This will take longer than you can imagine, but if the task is 
neglected entirely, euryops will still bloom profusely, just not as profusely. 
</P>
<P>
Euryops' foliage is even prettier than the flowers, and I have often added a 
branch to winter arrangements for the sheer beauty of the leaves. These leaves 
are often borne near the ends of the rather stark stems, so careful placement 
is needed so the branch won't crumple any tender flowers. In the landscape, 
these bare stems can look awkward and rangy, but if the plant is kept pruned 
the stems shouldn't be so obvious. And if pruning doesn't work, plant something 
low and bushy in front of euryops: Basket of Gold alyssum (Aurinia saxatilis) 
would echo the leaf and flower colors but in different textures. 
</P>
<P>
There is a bright-green version called Euryops pectinatus Viridis, but to my 
eyes the intense green leaves combined with the uncompromising yellow flowers 
are the visual equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the plants often featured in this column, euryops is easy to 
find; I can't remember ever being in a general-purpose nursery that didn't have 
one or both versions. (Surprisingly, euryops is rarely mentioned in gardening 
books; maybe this South Africa native is too "West Coast.") Available in one-, 
two- and five-gallon containers, euryops will provide instant, colorful 
landscaping and demand very little attention in the process. JUDITH SIMS

ROBERT HILBURN: HENDRIX REMIX: IMPROVED CDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The full-page ad appearing these days in various music magazines certainly 
looks inviting for Jimi Hendrix fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Here at last is the ultimate Hendrix legacy -- ten incredible compact discs, 
each digitally remastered to let you hear his music like you've never heard it 
before," the ad copy proclaims. "Get ready for a whole new experience." 
</P>
<P>
The page is dominated by a moody, black-and-white photo of the man called by 
many the most influential rock guitarist ever -- surrounded by smaller color 
photos of the individual CD album covers. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the 10 album possibilities, a casual fan interested in sampling 
Hendrix's work may be left with the question: "Where do I start?" 
</P>
<P>
The more obvious question for longtime fans, however, may be: "What do they 
mean, 'here at last?' Didn't I buy some of these albums in CD years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the latter question is yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
A Hendrix fan could buy CD versions of some of Hendrix's classic '60s albums -- 
such as "Are You Experienced?" -- as long ago as 1986, but it wasn't the "Are 
You Experienced?" now being advertised. The music was the same, but the sound 
quality wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
If the distinction is confusing, it's a confusion that is not uncommon in the 
compact-disc world. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lures of CDs, when they came on the market in the mid-'80s, was that 
the sound quality would be significantly better than that of the same album on 
vinyl or cassette recordings. And in most cases -- especially on new releases 
-- the promise was fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
But consumers found that the sound quality on some old '50s and '60s albums 
that were being re-released in CD form weren't noticeably better. In fact, the 
CDs sometimes sounded worse. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is the music on the first CD reissues initially were drawn from the 
master tapes used to make the original vinyl albums and the purity of CD sound 
mirrored sound deficiencies that had not been apparent in the vinyl version. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is CDs are more or less like computers -- you only get out what you 
put in," said Ed Outwater, vice president of quality assurance for Warner Bros. 
Records. "So if a CD is taken from the master tape of a certain 1962 album, it 
is going to sound exactly like the master tape . . . which means you may hear 
guitar amps buzzing, snaps and interference. 
</P>
<P>
"These same problems were on the 1962 vinyl album, but it wasn't as obvious 
because the deficiencies in the vinyl process would have masked some of the 
surface noise and pops. There's nothing to mask it on CD." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this problem, record companies began going back to the vaults in 
recent years and remixing master tapes specifically for CD. They also cleaned 
up the hums and buzzes that might have been on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Hendrix tapes, Warners made all the adjustments in 
association with producer Alan Douglas, who represents the Hendrix Estate, and 
mastering engineer Joe Gastwirt. 
</P>
<P>
Yet few companies -- including Warners in the case of Hendrix -- have 
identified the new copies so that consumers could tell from the packaging if 
they were getting one of the "new and improved" CDs or one of the original 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, all the major record labels have upgraded various CDs since 
they first came out and very few have alerted the consumer to the changes," 
said Pete Howard, editor of the excellent CD newsletter ICE. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, he feels, was economic. 
</P>
<P>
'My feeling is they want to avoid a stampede of exchange requests, especially 
from a lot of middle-level consumers who might not necessarily even appreciate 
the difference between the original CD and the remastered one," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they figure the audiophile and cutting-edge consumer will find out 
about the upgrade anyway and contact the company, asking about an exchange. If 
the consumer makes a good case, the companies have been known to honor the 
exchange, but they don't want to go on the record saying they will do that. CBS 
Records is the most progressive in this area. They even have an 800 hot line to 
discuss consumer concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Bakkemo, vice president of product manager and the overseer of the 
Hendrix catalogue for Warner Bros., believes it is time for companies to begin 
alerting consumers to the differences in CD editions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hendrix case, he said, Warners' ad campaign was delayed several months 
to allow the remastered CDs to replace the old ones on dealer shelves. In 
addition, Warners plans to begin shortly putting "remastered" information on 
the back of future Hendrix CD pressings. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that whenever something is done to improve the quality of the product, 
it's good to call attention to it," Bakkemo said. "That's true of the record 
business or a motor company that has a new bumper." 
</P>
<P>
Besides reworking the albums already released in CD, the Warners campaign 
involves the release of four albums for the first time in the configuration. 
Three -- "Smash Hits," "Jimi Plays Monterey" and the single-package, two-volume 
version of "Essential Jimi Hendrix" -- are already in the stores. A fourth, 
"The Jimi Hendrix Concerts," is due next week. 
</P>
<P>
The latter features live versions of such songs as "Fire," "Little Wing," "Wild 
Thing" and "Voodoo Childe" -- recorded with the Experience, mostly in 1968 at 
Winterland in San Francisco.

GARBAGE ART GETS A NEW TWIST IN THE HANDS OF MUSCOVITE ILYA KABAKOV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet artist Ilya Kabakov has arrived in Los Angeles with a big load of 
garbage. Getting the trash out of Moscow wasn't easy. Soviet customs officials 
didn't understand why he wanted to export the accumulated debris from his 
studio, and they feared that it might actually be valuable. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the officials were right. The aluminum cans, broken combs, 
match boxes, keys and wads of paper that Kabakov transported to the United 
States are symbolically valuable art materials. Kabakov needed them to create 
conceptual artworks in an exhibition opening today at the Fred Hoffman Gallery, 
912 Colorado Ave., in Santa Monica. "The Rope of Life and Other Installations," 
Kabakov's first show on the West Coast, will continue through Feb. 10. A 
reception for the artist is planned today from 3 to 5 p.m. at the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian garbage in Kabakov's work has nothing to do with the ecological 
problems of the West, the artist said, speaking through an interpreter. 
Instead, it symbolizes Russian culture that has been destroyed and reduced to 
the state of garbage -- something that once was important but has been ground 
into dust. 
</P>
<P>
Kabakov has created four separate works for the exhibition, but they are 
unified in their evocation of desperation. The works suggest the nerve-wracking 
quality of life in communal apartments, crowded offices and packed buses, as 
well as realities of an oppressive government that has lightened up but still 
distrusts individual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"I work on the borders of life within a system that treats individuals as small 
and unimportant," Kabakov said. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in the Ukraine in 1933 and has lived in Moscow since 1945, 
graduating from the Moscow Art School in 1951 and the Surikov Art School in 
1957. To make a living, Kabakov joined the Soviet Artists' Union and became a 
successful illustrator of children's books. In the meantime, his "unofficial 
work" developed into a highly unorthodox form. 
</P>
<P>
While conceptualists and trash pickers are plentiful in United States art 
circles, Soviet artists had little if any contact with such aesthetic 
developments until the last few years. Nonetheless, some of the best of the 
Soviet work fits quite seamlessly into the international annals of contemporary 
art. While current avant-garde art from the Soviet Union is almost relentlessly 
political and tends to have strong literary roots, the work fans out 
stylistically and philosophically from traditional painting to folk art and 
sophisticated conceptualism. 
</P>
<P>
Kabakov said that Russian literary traditions featuring underground characters 
have inspired his work. Life in Moscow also has been an important influence, as 
well as whatever he could learn about contemporary art in the West. 
</P>
<P>
He has become known for adopting the personae of fictitious characters and 
creating entire environments for them as well as texts that expose their 
private fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
His first exhibition in the United States, in 1988 at the Ronald Feldman 
Gallery in New York, featured the cramped living quarters of 10 characters, 
including "The Short Man," "The Collector," "The Untalented Artist," "The Man 
Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment" and "The Man Who Never Threw Anything 
Away." These invented people yearned for escape from banality and created 
complex fantasy worlds or orderly systems to deal with their distress. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fred Hoffman Gallery, Kabakov has created an ambience that looks 
unfinished but actually refers to Russia's notoriously shoddy workmanship. 
Absent "workers" haven't finished painting the walls, and they have left open 
paint cans and ladders behind them. In one room that is completely painted, a 
wobbly green line separates upper white walls from a dark brown strip that 
emulates wainscoting. 
</P>
<P>
Within this environment of messy austerity are four installations. The largest, 
an entire room called "On the Edge," has bits of garbage and snatches of 
conversation (printed in Russian on little cards) dangling from a string that 
runs around the walls. Kabakov repeats the phrases -- "Why is the table so 
dirty?" "Why are you throwing me out?" "Let him go where he wants" -- on tape, 
which is played in the gallery. An English translation is provided. 
</P>
<P>
In the other room are three other installations: "The Rope of Life," a 
biographical string of trash and text; "In the Corner," a placard that talks 
about retreat to a metaphoric corner and "fear of coming out into the middle," 
and "Box With Garbage," a wooden crate containing pieces of trash with attached 
printed phrases (often expressing frustration through obscenities). 
</P>
<P>
Visitors get a picture of an explosive society kept under wraps at enormous 
human expense. Kabakov agrees that his portrait of Russian life is profoundly 
negative, but he talks about his work with such warmth, wit and charm that he 
appears quite content. 
</P>
<P>
Is he a happy, unhappy man? 
</P>
<P>
The notion obviously pleases him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to be a happy man and an unhappy artist. In fact, it's a good 
combination," Kabakov said. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists like me are always a pessimists. No matter where we are, we find 
things that aren't right. This would be true even if we lived in paradise, but 
in Russia you don't have to look for discomfort. It's easy to be unhappy 
there." 
</P>
<P>
His professional life has taken off like a rocket since glasnost allowed him to 
show his work outside the Soviet Union, and he has had about 25 exhibitions at 
such prestigious places as the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the 
Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland. But fame isn't likely to change the nature of 
his work. "It has just given me the opportunity to express the ideas and 
feelings that already existed inside me," Kabakov said. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the best known and oldest artists whose works were in Sotheby's 
landmark 1988 auction in Moscow, Kabakov said the sale had little effect on 
him. But the auction exerted a strong influence on younger artists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The positive effect is that every artist needs to feel that someone is 
interested in his work. Unofficial artists hadn't had that experience before 
the auction. But the negative effect is that there is clearly and strongly a 
market price for art. That is something that many Soviet artists weren't 
prepared for, and the change has been too sudden," he said.

CZECH PRESIDENT SEES HIS PLAY PERFORMED IN NATIVE LANGUAGE; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: VACLAV HAVEL'S 'AUDIENCE' WAS BANNED UNTIL THE 'VELVET REVOLUTION' 
BROUGHT HIM TO POWER AT END OF 1989.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a classic example of East European drama, both on and off the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The play, long suppressed here, centered on a boozy conversation between a brew 
master/secret police informer and a blacklisted, dissident playwright forced to 
take a manual job at the brewery. But the collaborator is too human to hate, 
and the dissident too fallible to worship. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience was the real playwright, seeing his 15-year-old work performed 
on a public stage, in his native language, for the first time ever. But the 
playwright is no longer a dissident; now he's the president of Czechoslovakia. 
Except that you would never have known it from the way his old theater pals 
dragged him on stage for the curtain call and exchanged good-natured insults 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
The ecstatic audience did not know if it was watching theater or participating 
in it. It was all so comic and tragic and ambiguous and perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a play," director Jiri Menzel bubbled. "This is a happening!" 
</P>
<P>
And film maker Michael Wolkowitz, who has been taping it all for a Public 
Broadcasting Service television special to be aired in the United States in 
early spring, called it "the most remarkable theatrical experience of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The real-life, dissident playwright-turned-president is, of course, Vaclav 
Havel, who moved into Hradcany Castle, the traditional home of the Czechoslovak 
head of state, after this country's "velvet revolution" overturned 41 years of 
Communist rule in just 10 remarkable days at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His one-act play, "Audience," is well-known in the West but had never been 
publicly staged in his native land until this week, when New York-based 
executive producers Wolkowitz and Robert Kanter arranged four performances -- 
two in English, two in Czech -- for their PBS special. 
</P>
<P>
Underwritten by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the television production is also 
to include documentary sections on Havel and interviews with the president and 
various other Czechoslovak citizens, including workers at the Trutnov brewery 
where Havel worked briefly before writing the play in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Audience's" dissident, named Vanek, features in two more Havel plays, and 
later he was borrowed by three of Havel's best friends, who wrote a total of 
five of their own plays around him. All the plays are full of laughs, but to 
call them comedies belittles their penetrating insights into a repressive 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In the introduction to "The Vanek Plays: Four Authors, One Character," editor 
Marketa Goetz-Stankiewicz writes: "None of the four writers provides the 
comforting service of pitching poor, nice Vanek against brutal representatives 
of political power. . . . Such a reassuring, cowboy-movie pattern does not 
emerge from the intensely searching literature of Central Europe." 
</P>
<P>
There are no villains in the Vanek plays, Goetz-Stankiewicz adds. The 
characters he encounters are too human in their weakness, greed and fear to be 
truly evil. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothin' can ever happen to you," the besotted brewer shouts at Vanek during 
the climax of "Audience." 
</P>
<P>
"There's always somebody interested in how you doin'. You always know how to 
fix that. You're still up there, even when you're down and out. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn right you gonna fight for your damn principles. They're worth a fortune 
to you. You know just how to sell them principles. You're makin' a killin' on 
them. You're livin' off them. But what about me? I only get my ass busted for 
havin' principles! 
</P>
<P>
"You always got a chance, but what kind of a chance have I got? Nobody's gonna 
take care of me. Nobody's afraid of me. Nobody's gonna write anything about me. 
Nobody's gonna gimme a hand. Nobody's interested in me. All I'm good for is to 
be the manure that your damn principles gonna grow out of." 
</P>
<P>
Vanek's principles, meanwhile, prevent him from doing the brew master the favor 
of writing surveillance reports on himself. But he is tempted by the prospects 
of a transfer from the freezing brewery basement to a cushy job in a warm 
warehouse. And, at the end, he adopts his boss's own crude vocabulary to agree 
that "everything's all f---ed up." 
</P>
<P>
Wolkowitz, a partner in New York's MJM Creative Services, and Kanter say they 
got the idea for their special after seeing the English-language stage 
production by Actors Studio of "Audience" in New York early last month. About 
the same time, Havel and the Civic Forum democratic movement were in the 
process of peacefully overthrowing Communist rule here. 
</P>
<P>
Wolkowitz and Kanter wasted no time putting together a production and financing 
package and bringing the Actors Studio team to Prague to put on the two 
English-language performances here, starring Lou Brockway and Kevin O'Connor at 
the Cinoherni Club just off famed Wenceslas Square. 
</P>
<P>
The Czech production stars Josef Abrham and Pavel Landovsky, who was able to 
return to his native country after years in Vienna exile after last month's 
revolution. Before his exile, he and Havel used to put on the play themselves 
for their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Havel attended the first of the two Czech-language performances and afterward 
kidded Landovsky for stumbling over some of his lines as the drunken 
brewmaster. When Landovsky protested that he had only had a few days to prepare 
for the role, Havel shot back: "Pavel, you've had 16 years to learn this. You 
have no excuse."

NBC WILL PITCH MINISERIES AGAINST BASEBALL; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ENTERTAINMENT PRESIDENT TARTIKOFF OUTLINES NETWORK'S 
COUNTERPROGRAMMING STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Alda won't be joining NBC for the 1990-91 season -- but Jackie Collins, 
Danielle Steel, Jane Curtin, Richard Roundtree and a TV movie about Jim and 
Tammy Bakker will. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to compete with CBS' televising of baseball's playoffs and World 
Series in the fall, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff told a news 
conference Thursday that three novels by Steel and two by Collins will be 
developed into miniseries to counterprogram the games, which were wrested from 
NBC by CBS in a bidding war last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the bride left at the altar," Tartikoff said. "We're not going to take 
this lying down." 
</P>
<P>
The Steel best-sellers "Daddy" and "Fine Things" will become two-hour movies, 
and "Kaleidoscope" will become a four-hour miniseries. They are the first of 
her books to go into production as part of a long-term exclusive contract 
between Steel and NBC, Tartikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 26 (books) available, and if these are successful, we don't have to 
wait for her to write a new book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' books "Chances" and "Lucky," about an Italian gangster, will be 
combined as a six-hour miniseries. Tartikoff predicted that "the running Mafia 
theme" would lure both male and female viewers away from baseball. When it was 
mentioned that the last miniseries based on similiar material, CBS' adaptation 
of the Judith Krantz novel "I'll Take Manhattan," garnered disappointing 
ratings, Tartikoff said, "It (success) really depends on the subject matter." 
</P>
<P>
Alda, who had had an hourlong series in development for the network in which he 
would have starred as a judicial system employee facing midlife crisis, has 
"just begged off" because of a movie deal with Disney and other feature-film 
directing commitments, Tartikoff said. He added that Alda's recent appearance 
in Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" has injected some life into Alda's 
feature career. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff joked that he would not reveal too many details about Alda's original 
script for NBC because "there is still time in this development season for some 
people who are relative newcomers" to network TV to steal the idea. He was 
referring to new CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky, one of Tartikoff's 
former programming lieutenants. Tartikoff added that NBC might develop the 
series with another star. 
</P>
<P>
While Alda is no longer cooperating with NBC, Jim and Tammy Bakker are. "Fall 
From Grace," the authorized story of the demise of Bakker's ministry, will go 
into production, Tartikoff said, although no air date was announced. He 
maintained that the endorsement of the Bakkers will not soften the story. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to show them collecting stamps," Tartikoff said. "It's not 
going to be a love poem to this couple." Bernadette Peters will portray Tammy 
Bakker; the role of Jim Bakker has not been cast. 
</P>
<P>
Following last season's flurry of advertiser boycotts of controversial TV 
projects, including NBC's "Roe vs. Wade" and "The Tracy Thurman Story," 
Tartikoff said that the network has set aside money to cover any loss of 
advertising it might incur with the Bakker movie. He called such budgeting a 
standard procedure, and added that the network expects the Bakker story to be 
"a big ratings-getter." 
</P>
<P>
Two other miniseries -- "A Woman Named Jackie," about the life of Jacqueline 
Onassis, and "The Oldest Living Confederate Tells All," based on the 
best-selling book about a Civil War widow -- are also in development for fall, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaft" veteran Richard Roundtree will join the cast of NBC's newest daytime 
soap, "Generations," Tartikoff said, and Jane Curtin, the former co-star of 
"Kate and Allie" and "Saturday Night Live," is set to star in a half-hour 
comedy for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tartikoff is tinkering with the existing schedule. "My Two Dads" 
will return to NBC at 8 p.m. Sundays beginning Jan. 21; "Ann Jillian," 
currently airing in the time slot, will be pulled until March, to be re-tooled 
by a new set of producers. 
</P>
<P>
Following a fall season that created no big hits for NBC -- or the other 
networks -- Tartikoff was asked if he found himself looking over his shoulder 
at the competition more now than in recent years, particularly with a new man 
in charge at No. 3 CBS and some of NBC's biggest successes, including "The 
Cosby Show" and "Cheers," aging. He replied that NBC expects some of its 
current shows, including "Dear John," "Quantum Leap" and "Midnight Caller," to 
develop into Top 10 shows if the network nurtures them as it did "Cheers," 
which faltered in the ratings during its first seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Of Sagansky, Tartikoff said he "is a talented, resourceful and creative 
programmer and broadcaster. They (CBS) were lucky and fortunate to get him, and 
if they give him enough free rein to do what I know he knows how to do, I think 
they'll see some improvement." 
</P>
<P>
After the press session, however, a tongue-in-cheek Tartikoff revealed a 
"secret" about Sagansky that Tartikoff said he had politely been keeping under 
wraps: The 1983 series "Manimal," a stunning flop about a young professor with 
the uncanny ability to transform himself into jungle animals in order to help 
the police solve crimes -- for which Tartikoff has heretofore accepted blame -- 
was actually Sagansky's idea. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff said that, after years of taking the rap for "Manimal," it was time 
to reveal the truth: "It was his idea. He brought it to me, and I said, 'This 
is horrible!' "

POPE HELPS MAKE ECOLOGY A MAJOR CONCERN OF RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organized religion has taken increasing note of environmental danger signals. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from usual themes for his annual peace message on New Year's 
Day, Pope John Paul II issued a call for greater awareness of environmental 
concerns, equating ecological destruction with a "genuine contempt" for 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
The speech linked disregard for nature and plundering of natural resources to a 
decline in the quality of life. That decline, he said, leads to a "sense of 
precariousness and insecurity" that creates "a seedbed for collective 
selfishness, disregard for others and dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's address was warmly received by a number of environmental and 
religious activists involved in the North American Conference on Religion and 
Ecology. The group was founded in March, 1989, specifically "to help the North 
American religious community enter into the environmental movement in the 
1990s, with more informed understanding, deeper commitment and a dynamic sense 
of environmental service." 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope, for the first time, has given high priority to environmental 
concerns," said Donald B. Conroy, conference president. "The theological and 
ethical implications of this pontifical statement are enormous. In this one 
statement, the Pope has raised major eco-justice questions underlying the 
global search for peace." 
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the group, based in Washington, is one of a number of 
developments showing that concern for the environment is fast becoming a major 
issue of the new decade for religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the religious-legislative "Global Forum on Environment and 
Development" next week in Moscow, the World Council of Churches in March will 
hold a worldwide gathering on "Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation" in 
Seoul, South Korea, to consider an agenda heavy with environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The papal message at the start of the year said depletion of the Earth's ozone 
layer and the related "greenhouse effect" are the results of industrial 
practices that have shown little regard for delicate ecological balances. 
Redressing environmental damage will not be possible, the Pope said, without 
"directly addressing the structural forms of poverty that exist throughout the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope said it is necessary for the religious community to address the 
environmental effects of war, of a life style that embraces unbridled 
consumerism and of "indiscriminate application of advances in science and 
technology."

BLIGHT KNOWS NO BORDER, CLAN LEADER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SPIRITUAL LEADERS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WILL ATTEND A GLOBAL 
CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW ON PROTECTING THE EARTH FROM POLLUTION.

When a city dumps its sewage into an adjacent river, pollution not only affects 
it but other cities down the river. Each adds to the blight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to pay a penalty," says Chief Oren Lyons, an American Indian 
spiritual leader, in sketching that image of the cumulative effects of 
despoiling nature. 
</P>
<P>
"All these currents in the world, the air, the water, the currents of life on 
land, the wind, even the Earth we travel on, are moving and they don't 
recognize any borders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons of Onondaga, N.Y., is one of a score of indigenous spiritual leaders from 
many lands participating in an international conference next week in Moscow on 
protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"There are natural laws that govern the air, that govern the land and govern 
the water, and it behooves us to know what those laws are if we're going to 
survive. You can't argue with natural laws. If we keep violating them, we won't 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Close to Nature 
</P>
<P>
Lyons, 59, a clan chief of the Onondaga branch of the Iroquois and director of 
an American Indians studies program at the State University of New York at 
Buffalo, said Indians are especially attuned to life's basis in nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Indians and other indigenous people have lived in nature, close to the earth, 
and understand its wisdom and laws," he said. "That wellspring philosophy needs 
to be brought to the world." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to do that are planned at a "Global Forum on Environment and 
Development for Survival" in Moscow Monday through Friday, involving religious 
leaders, legislators and scientists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Several scientists and members of Congress are among the 200 registered 
participants, about half of them representing Christianity, Judaism, Islam, 
Hinduism and Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
About a fifth of the religious contingent is made up of spiritual leaders of 
the Americas, Africa, Australia and Pacific islands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've been able to get ourselves together for this broad a 
representation," said Lyons, a member of the conference steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Indigenous people have a long-term moral perspective on the Earth and its 
life. We have no complex answers, but only the simple principle of respect for 
all life, for the trees, the rivers, the fish, the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Simple Rules 
</P>
<P>
"The world is very complex today, but values still remain simple, the 
principles of life remain simple. If we break those rules of life and 
procreation, we break the cycle of life, and life will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"The Earth will not disappear, but people will. We're not going to destroy the 
world. The world has its own time cycle. But we are still only a biological 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time, the Earth had great dinosaurs, but they are not here anymore. It 
could be that one time people will not be here anymore. That's up to us, and 
the directions we take." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow conference opens with an address by U.N. Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled to address 
its closing session. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second such conference for the New York-based Global Forum; the first 
took place in 1988 at Oxford University. In a rare partnership, Soviet churches 
and the first freely elected Supreme Soviet are co-hosting the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the American Indian's affinity with nature needs to "be transferred 
to the public at large." 
</P>
<P>
"Our ceremonies" have kept that perspective alive, he said. "They're ingrained 
as part of life. We celebrate the sacredness of the Earth in a year-round cycle 
of ceremonies expressing respect and gratitude for it." 
</P>
<P>
Human links with it derive from "the Creator," Lyons said. "If we go contrary 
to his rules for it, we're certainly going to suffer. We don't own the land. We 
borrow it from the future. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are accountable for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Time itself is involved, he said. A chain saw can cut a 500-year-old tree in 10 
minutes, he noted, but machines can't make another like it grow to maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a taking technology without a giving side to it," he said. "That's 
what has to be adjusted. People have a voracious appetite, but they're not 
exempt from the natural law or its consequences."

Students for the Catholic priesthood need to return to more traditional 
learning by studying both Greek and Latin and the teaching of the church's 
earliest writers, the Vatican said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Congregation for Catholic Education said seminaries and theological 
faculties should place greater emphasis on the study of the so-called "Church 
Fathers" of the early centuries, whose work is considered the basis of church 
doctrine and orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
The writings of the Church Fathers are important to both Eastern and Western 
Christian traditions, and the study of their work is called patristics and 
patrology. 
</P>
<P>
"Theological reflection has always been clearly aware that there is something 
in the Fathers which is unique, irreplaceable and perennially valid," it said. 
"In order for the church to continue growing, it is necessary to know their 
doctrine and works thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
The document lamented that theologians often give scant attention to the early 
teachings, which sometimes become "caught up in an overall rejection of the 
past" or "taken over by the various fashionable philosophies and ideologies of 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
"Theologians . . . think that they are doing theology but are really only doing 
history, sociology, etc.," it said.

EX-ANGLICAN WITH WIFE, CHILDREN TO BE ORDAINED AS CATHOLIC PRIEST

A former Anglican priest with a wife and four children will be ordained a Roman 
Catholic priest today by the Archdiocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Nicholls, 47, will be ordained by Cardinal John O'Connor at St. Joseph's 
Seminary in Yonkers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most Christian denominations, the Roman Catholic Church, with few 
exceptions, insists that its priests be single and celibate. But 10 years ago, 
the Vatican said American bishops could ordain some Anglican or Episcopalian 
priests who were married and who had left their churches and converted to 
Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 50 married converts have been ordained as Roman Catholic 
priests in the United States, the archdiocese said. Several had left their 
churches because they were opposed to liberal reforms, such as the ordination 
of women. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls teaches at a Catholic high school in Kingston, north of New York City. 
Archdiocesan officials said they were not sure when he left the Anglican 
Church, or the Church of England, which is related to the Episcopal Church in 
the United States.

DISNEY PROPOSES NEW $1-BILLION THEME PARK; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: COMPANY PITS ANAHEIM AND LONG BEACH IN COMPETITION FOR THE NEW 
TOURIST ATTRACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taking a look into tomorrowland, Walt Disney Co. said Friday that it hopes to 
build a $1-billion theme park in Southern California in the next decade and 
reinvigorate 35-year-old Disneyland with dozens of new attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new park will pit Anaheim and Long Beach against each other in a 
high-stakes game to become the Southland's premier tourist stop. But Disney 
officials warned that without government assistance to solve traffic problems, 
a new park will remain a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements at Disneyland, the nation's second most popular amusement park 
after Walt Disney World in Florida, will begin immediately and will be phased 
in over the next 10 years. Company officials have described the costly 
expansion and remodeling as the largest in the park's history. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the '90s -- the decade we re-invent the Disney experience, not just in 
California, but worldwide," Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief 
executive, said at a press conference Friday in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner said the company's 10-year plans call for the addition at the Magic 
Kingdom of a slew of rides based on hit movies -- including "The Little 
Mermaid," the "Indiana Jones" series and the upcoming "Dick Tracy," giving 
Disneyland a more glitzy, Hollywood flavor. 
</P>
<P>
He also detailed plans to add two new theme areas -- Mickey's Starland and 
Hollywoodland, a major new area of the theme park that will be a fantasy 
re-creation of Hollywood Boulevard. The Tomorrowland section of the park also 
will be completely redone. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has been considering construction of a second amusement park in Southern 
California for at least four years. Eisner said the company wants to build the 
new park in Anaheim near Disneyland or in Long Beach. But the project is 
contingent on government cooperation to resolve traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are enormous with the infrastructure -- in terms of traffic 
systems, exit roads, parking, the needed amount of land." Eisner said. "A 
second gate is beyond the capacity of the Walt Disney Co. Without the interest 
of citizens, the city council and the mayor (of either city), it will never 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the press conference, Eisner said there would have to be 
some kind of governmental financial support "in things like infrastructure." He 
noted that in France and Florida, the company has been able to win concessions 
on issues ranging from zoning to widening roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't build highways," Eisner said. "Unless we have a partnership," the 
project will not be built. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Anaheim or Long Beach wins the new attraction "depends a lot on which 
one wants us more," Eisner said. He estimated that the cost of the new park 
could be well over $1 billion and said the company hopes to begin developing it 
by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, a second park could be added on 40 acres already owned by the 
company near Disneyland. There are another 30 undeveloped acres within 
Disneyland in the so-called "backstage" areas. Eisner also said current parking 
lots might be used, if alternative parking space could be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Or we could use a combination of those areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter enthusiastically endorsed the proposal for a second 
theme park, and city officials said they are prepared to arrange off-site 
parking and transportation to a new facility, if that is what it would take to 
win the new park. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, meanwhile, Disney officials met Thursday with city officials, 
showing them drawings and slides of a nautical-themed park. Disney now leases 
55 acres -- where the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions are located -- 
and has an option to develop another 256 acres, now mostly under water. 
</P>
<P>
"It would obviously be ocean-oriented and an educational-type attraction with a 
nautical and water theme," said Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell. "We're excited 
about the possibility, as long as the traffic and financial implications are 
attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eisner was cautious in emphasizing that the second theme park is 
desirable from the company's standpoint, but far from definite. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can solve the problems in California, the state as a Disney 
destination is going to become less important as Florida becomes more 
important," he said, referring to Disney's hugely successful, 30,000-acre Walt 
Disney World in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, almost two years ago, Disney scuttled plans to build a $611-million 
theme park and shopping mall in downtown Burbank -- after 15 years and endless 
discussions with city officials there -- when it determined that estimated 
revenue would not support the project. 
</P>
<P>
Far more definite than a second Southland theme park are the company's plans to 
spruce up and expand Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Eisner said, the Muppets will invade Disneyland with a Muppets stage 
show. The park also will add a Young Indiana Jones ride, similar to one in 
Florida in which the movie hero survives flipped Jeeps, flash fires and rolling 
boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, in 1993, Mickey's Starland is scheduled to open, coinciding 
with the corporate mascot's 65th birthday. The new themed area will feature a 
birthday party show, a chance for customers to shake Mickey's hand, plus a 
Muppet Movie in "Muppetvision 3-D." A "Little Mermaid" attraction based on the 
hit film also will be added. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrowland -- with its outdated Mission to Mars ride -- will be completely 
refurbished in 1994. While turnstiles will continue to click at the most 
popular attractions -- Star Tours and Space Mountain -- new rides will include 
two outer-space rides -- an alien encounter and Plectu's Fantastic Galactic 
Review. A new 3-D movie by film maker George Lucas, creator of the park's 
Captain Eo ride, will be added and an entire second story will be built, so 
that sky walks will crisscross all of Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
An attraction based on the Dick Tracy movie will be added in 1996, giving park 
patrons the chance to chase crooks through city streets in racing police 
sedans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most elaborate changes will happen in early 1999, with Disneyland 
adding Hollywoodland -- complete with a white-lettered sign -- with four new 
attractions: a Toon Town ride and Oversized Baby Buggy ride, both of which have 
patrons careening through scenes from the hit movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Two rides planned for the new Hollywoodland are borrowed from Walt Disney 
World: the Great Movie Ride, which lets customers travel through recreations of 
movie classics, and Superstar TV, in which selected patrons will be able to 
appear in classic episodes of "I Love Lucy" or the "Johnny Carson Show." 
</P>
<P>
Eisner, who joined Disney six years ago, declined to reveal the cost of the 
additions other than to say he hoped they would be financed by Disney's 
earnings and that each attraction must meet its company-required return on 
investment.

U.S. TO CONTRAS: DON'T COUNT ON ANY MORE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration has told the Nicaraguan Contras that they cannot count 
on continued U.S. aid after the Nicaraguan election next month and that they 
should begin to plan the demobilization of most of their force, U.S. and Contra 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials promised to seek continued aid from Congress to help 
the estimated 12,000 rebels move back to Nicaragua or to other countries from 
their bases in Honduras, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But a Contra spokesman said the U.S. officials also warned bluntly that 
"Congress is not going to keep extending the aid indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
The message to the Contras, delivered in a meeting on Wednesday between 
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson and rebel military leader Enrique 
Bermudez, is the clearest sign yet that the Administration expects most of the 
rebel army to disband after the Feb. 25 election. 
</P>
<P>
Some Contra officials are openly resentful of the Administration's decision. 
"This is a decision . . . by people who have no guts," said Adolfo Calero, a 
conservative Contra leader. "We have been treated very badly." 
</P>
<P>
But others said they accept it as realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed, but as a political organization we have to be pragmatic 
enough to recognize the conditions that influence the policy of the United 
States," said Bosco Matamoros, the rebels' chief spokesman, who attended the 
meeting with Aronson. "Is there a political will to restart the war in 
Nicaragua, taking into account the changing American relationship with the 
Soviet Union? The answer is no." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration action was part of a series of steps taken during the past 
year to disengage from the Contra war. Supporting the rebels' attempts to 
overthrow Nicaragua's leftist government was a major preoccupation of President 
Ronald Reagan, who backed them with millions of dollars and occasional help 
from CIA paramilitary forces. But President Bush and Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III have moved steadily away from the Reagan Administration's 
commitment, although they have publicly pledged to uphold it. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the account of the Wednesday meeting from Administration officials 
speaking anonymously, the State Department insisted in public that no decisions 
have been made yet about aid for the Contras once the current appropriation of 
about $4.5 million a month in non-military assistance runs out. Administration 
officials expect the money to last until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States government remains committed to the resistance," State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "No specific future action has been 
ruled in or out." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said Aronson told the Contra leaders "that decisions on the nature of 
future assistance would depend in part on the conduct of elections in 
Nicaragua." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials once hoped to keep the Contra force alive as a means 
of putting pressure on Nicaragua's leftist government if President Daniel 
Ortega wins reelection. As a result, the Administration initially resisted a 
call by the five Central American presidents last year to demobilize the 
Contras by last Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
But officials now say the chance of winning approval in Congress for renewed 
military aid to the rebels has virtually evaporated, even if the Sandinista 
government wins the election through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"The votes aren't there, any way you look at it," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Contra officials said they expect some of the remaining Contras to 
return to Nicaragua under an amnesty program and a handful to go into the 
country's northern mountains to keep fighting the government without U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
But the largest number may well ask for relocation in the United States or 
other countries in Central America -- posing a dilemma for the Administration, 
which has not yet decided whether to offer refugee status to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez, in an interview with the Boston Globe, said Aronson told him that 
further U.S. aid could only be used to help Contras return to Nicaragua -- a 
choice many of the rebels reject. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to abandon us totally, but they will reduce the money and 
allow its use only for purposes of repatriation," Bermudez said. "Basically, 
they told me that no other option will happen . . . unless the Sandinistas do 
something like kill all the opposition leaders at once and then hang them in a 
public square in Managua." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials contested that account, saying they had not made a final 
decision as to how aid will be restricted after the election. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three messages for them," a senior official said of the meeting. 
"First, this government has a moral commitment to the Contras. Second, we've 
got to start talking about the situation after February. But third, I can't 
tell you what the aid is going to look like, because we don't know how the 
election has turned out." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue was: What is the current political reality, and what are our 
options?" Matamoros said. "The international environment makes it very unlikely 
that there will be continued U.S. aid. . . . So our options are basically 
reintegration into national life in Nicaragua or relocation into third 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"That means it's over," Calero said.

pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs for allowing a half-million gallons of 
fuel oil to spill from a pipeline into a busy waterway between New York and New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the worst spill to hit the New York metropolitan area in two 
decades, and as the cleanup continues almost two weeks later, the stench of 
fuel oil still lingers in the area. Many local officials have expressed outrage 
because Exxon employees apparently disregarded repeated warnings from their own 
alarm system and allowed the leak to continue for 12 hours before acknowledging 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state of New Jersey filed suit against Exxon Friday. At the 
same time, New York officials hammered out an agreement with Exxon under which 
the oil giant agreed to compensate the state for the environmental damage 
caused by the Jan. 2 spill as well as the costs of a study to determine the 
extent of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Both states are continuing criminal investigations to determine whether Exxon 
was negligent or failed to act decisively enough to bring the spill under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency is also looking into the incident 
and has given Exxon until Wednesday to reply to a list of questions about its 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The spill has brought a new round of unwelcome attention to Exxon, which is 
struggling to repair its image after one of its tankers spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil in Alaska last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily industrial Arthur Kill, where the spill occurred, is far from being 
as pristine as Alaska's Prince William Sound. However, it is the site of an 
important and fragile wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Prall's Island, one of the areas affected by the spill off Staten Island, is a 
seasonal home to more than 1,000 pairs of rare herons. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the bodies of more than 300 dead birds -- mostly ducks, geese and 
gulls -- have been recovered. Environmentalists fear the effects may worsen 
this spring, when migratory birds such as the herons return and begin feeding 
and nesting in the tainted areas. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Exxon estimated that only 5,000 gallons had spilled on Jan. 2, but 
it now acknowledges that at least 100 times that much fuel oil escaped through 
a rupture in the 20-year-old, 12-inch-wide pipeline. The cause of the leak has 
not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
In its own version of events, Exxon has said that an alarm sounded in its 
leak-detection system late on the night of Jan. 1. Its operators, accustomed to 
false alarms from a system that had been operating poorly for years, relied on 
a backup procedure that indicated all was well. 
</P>
<P>
That sequence of events happened two more times during the next 12 hours. Only 
after inquiries from the Coast Guard and local authorities did Exxon discover 
the leak and report it to federal and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that Exxon's failure to properly maintain and monitor its 
leak-detection system has led to one of the greatest avoidable ecological 
disasters in New York City's history," New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams wrote 
Wednesday in a letter to Exxon President Lee R. Raymond. Drawing a comparison 
that many other officials here have made, Abrams called the situation a 
"mini-Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with company officials Friday afternoon, Abrams said he is 
satisfied with Exxon's assurances that it will pay for all the damage it has 
caused. State officials said those costs alone will run well into millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams noted that New York retains the option of a lawsuit if Exxon fails to 
live up to its side of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
He said no estimates of the amount Exxon might owe would be available until 
after the study was completed. He added Exxon would not perform the study but 
would assume the cost. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey's civil suit, filed by Atty. Gen. Peter Perretti, charged Exxon 
violated the state's oil spill and water pollution control laws. The suit also 
charges damages under the common law. 
</P>
<P>
Under New Jersey's suit, Exxon is liable for fines of $50,000 daily for each 
violation, the number of which has yet to be determined, according to a 
spokesman for Perretti. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks to have Exxon repay any cleanup expenses the state incurs. 
</P>
<P>
John Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental 
Protection, said the state hasn't "been able to put a price tag on our 
environment yet."

<P>
President Bush took time out on Friday to meet privately with the family of 
Army Pfc. James Markwell, a Ranger medic killed by gunfire during the Dec. 20 
Panama invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Bush, in Cincinnati where he spoke to a gathering of the 
city's Chamber of Commerce, expressed his personal sympathy and gratitude for 
the sacrifice that Markwell made for his country. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters later, 
said the President's talk with the family of the dead soldier was "a pretty 
emotional meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that "we were all pretty broken up about it," referring to the 
President, as well as several aides and Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the soldier's mother, Mrs. William Rouse, showed the President a 
poem that her son had written when he was 15 years old about being in the 
military, as well as a "death message" that he had written before going into 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that in that message her son "was proud of what he was doing. It 
was a little message for each of the people he knew in life." 
</P>
<P>
"That was really tough," Fitzwater added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has sent letters of condolence to all the families of all those killed in 
Panama, officials said.

PANAMA: RELATIVES CHEER AS 2,000 TROOPS ARRIVE BY WAY OF A DRAMATIC PARACHUTE 
JUMP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty giant C-141 transport planes streaked across the dawn sky over Ft. Bragg 
on Friday, leaving behind a swarm of light green parachutes as nearly 2,000 
paratroopers floated to Earth on their triumphant return home after invading 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of relatives packing Ft. Bragg's Sicily Drop Zone cheered and 
whistled as the first troops touched down and the division band struck up a 
John Philip Sousa march. 
</P>
<P>
The commanding general, Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner, was the first to jump and later 
paid tribute to those troops who died during the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience gives meaning to the expression that freedom isn't free," 
Stiner said during a welcoming ceremony at the drop zone. "Everyone knew there 
would be personal danger but not a single one hesitated to go or to enter a 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You would have been very proud of your soldiers. No one has ever been more 
disciplined under fire or more mature in carrying out their duties," he added. 
"The Panamanians will always be thankful because we gave back to them that 
which had been stolen from them the past 10 years -- their freedom. We're proud 
we did it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the soldiers returned home by jumping out of planes instead of 
walking off them, base spokesman Capt. Lewis Boone said: "Their primary means 
of deployment is jumping. They will jump whenever possible -- over here, over 
there, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
As the 1,924 soldiers approached the ground, they lowered their packs and 
rifles on lines to lighten the load while landing. Stiner said the troopers' 
front-carried packs weighed 100 pounds when fully loaded with ammunition, as 
they were during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The 82nd Airborne Division troops conducted a night parachute assault onto the 
capital airfield east of Panama City, secured it, and moved out within hours to 
secure other targets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers received minor injuries in Friday's jump, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Families and soldiers had 30 minutes to greet one another before the troops 
resumed formation to march to their barracks. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of the paratroopers floating to the ground choked up Kathleen Salino, 
of North Hollywood, Calif., who flew in to greet her son, Spec. Cass Hadaway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just amazed, stunned," she said. "I was very upset when he left. From what 
I read in the paper, they had a rough time over there. He's my first-born son. 
This has changed my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Tipton hugged her son, Capt. Donald Fontenot, 28, and handed him the 
thing he missed the most in Panama -- fast food. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I wanted an Egg McMuffin and a Diet Coke," Fontenot said. "That's 
all I've been thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Vicki Zamora, 27, one of two women on the division's manifest, was 
stationed in a Panamanian building that had been under mortar fire. She was 
greeted by her husband, Gus Zamora, 34, and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if women should go into in combat, she replied: "We all train as a team, 
and we need to fight as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Stiner said everyone in the invasion came under fire because the troops 
attacked 27 targets simultaneously.

NORIEGA'S DEFENSE TEAM UNDERGOING EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: CHIEF COUNSEL FRANK RUBINO SAYS FIRST TO BE ADDED IS A LAWYER WHO IS AN 
AUTHORITY ON THE USE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief defense attorney for Manuel A. Noriega announced Friday that his 
two-member legal team is being expanded to include lawyers from other parts of 
the country who are expert in classified information and international and 
constitutional law. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by attorney Frank A. Rubino follows criticism by other lawyers 
that the drug-trafficking prosecution of the deposed Panamanian dictator raises 
too many significant issues to be handled by two "sole practitioners" from 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra investigation, which 
found evidence that Noriega offered in 1986 to assassinate Nicaraguan 
government officials for the United States, moved to examine the "massive 
amount" of documents obtained by U.S. forces in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, confirmed Friday that 
the counsel's office had called about seeing the documents, which are being 
studied in Panama by Justice Department lawyers and FBI and Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel said Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh had directed that there be "fullest 
cooperation" with the independent counsel's request. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Magistrate Peter Palermo, over government objections, set bond 
for Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda at $1 million. However, Miranda 
remained in custody while prosecutors appealed the decision on grounds that 
there is a high risk he will flee. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino announced the defense team expansion as he met with reporters outside 
the U.S. courthouse after conferring with Noriega in his basement cell. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino said that the first outside expert to be hired is New York lawyer David 
Lewis, an authority on the use of classified information in criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis served as a defense attorney for former CIA agent Edwin P. Wilson in his 
trial for plotting and attempting to carry out the assassination of two federal 
prosecutors and several witnesses from his previous trials. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino declined to comment on reports that Noriega soon would be moved to a 
more secure location outside the Miami area. It was learned that government and 
defense lawyers discussed such a proposal at a closed-door court hearing 
earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino's news conference came as defense lawyers involved in the case learned 
of a physical attack against Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, by a man 
wielding a crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kane, his head heavily bandaged and his shirt bloodstained, told about the 
attack at a bond hearing held for his client. The attorney said he was clubbed 
as he stepped outside his home Friday morning by an assailant whom he chased 
and subdued with the help of a passing motorist. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, arrested by police, said that he had been sent by someone, 
according to O'Kane. But he apparently did not reveal who sent him. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kane, whose list of past clients has included narcotics traffickers, said he 
believed that the attack was related to recent publicity about his 
representation of Miranda, a pilot who has been accused of transporting 
$800,000 in drug money to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Miami police late Friday night discounted the theory that the attack on O'Kane 
was related to the Noriega case, saying that the assailant held a grudge 
against O'Kane because of a drug prosecution last year. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kane had been criticized by federal prosecutors this week for alleging, in 
open court, that the secretive U.S. National Security Agency had conducted 
electronic eavesdropping on telephone calls and other communications between 
defendants in the Noriega case. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler to censure 
O'Kane for raising the matter in a public session, but the judge took no 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino, asked about the attack on O'Kane, said: "I hope people know that Gen. 
Noriega, as well as anyone else in our country, is entitled to legal 
representation and a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped an expanded legal team of four to six attorneys could be 
assembled within a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's alleged offer to assassinate Sandinista leaders in Nicaragua came to 
light during the trial of former White House national security aide Oliver L. 
North. The government acknowledged that the offer had been made by a Noriega 
representative to North, who told him that U.S. law barred such actions. 
</P>
<P>
However, with the alleged backing of former President Ronald Reagan's National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North met with Noriega in London and 
discussed sabotage of Sandinista targets, according to government admissions 
during the North trial. 
</P>
<P>
While a spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh declined to 
discuss the request for documents, it appears to be aimed at filling gaps in 
the Iran-Contra affair rather than to initiate new prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson reported from Miami and Ostrow reported from Washington. Times staff 
writer John J. Goldman contributed to this story from New York.

Atty. Gen. Rogelio Cruz has brought charges against 50 members of the regime of 
deposed strongman Manuel A. Noriega, the independent La Prensa newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The targets of the charges, which range from illicit use of government funds to 
cover-up, include Noriega's wife Felicidad, now in hiding in the Cuban 
ambassador's residence, and former President Manuel Solis Palma, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
La Prensa said that Solis Palma had been called in twice for questioning by the 
attorney general's office on charges of "impeding the formation, functioning 
and renovation of state organs." If convicted, he could face 15 years in jail, 
it said.

NEXT PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT? PICK A DAY, ANY DAY;

"President Warns Against Blood Bath," a recent headline in the Evening Star 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
"Aquino Voices Fears of New Coup Attempt" -- Philippines Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentine Coup Shaping Up" -- People's Journal Tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Coup Plotters Sowing Confusion, Intrigue" -- Manila Times. 
</P>
<P>
Such has been the daily fare of rumor and speculation since last month's 
abortive effort by rebel soldiers to overthrow President Corazon Aquino. In the 
weeks since, government officials, rebel leaders and senior diplomats have 
warned repeatedly of new and bloodier uprisings to come. 
</P>
<P>
But the much-predicted Christmas coup failed to materialize. Despite forecasts 
to the contrary, New Year's Eve was also quiet, unless you count the nine 
killed and 1,600 wounded by revelers' customary gunfire and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
New dates for a coup are floated regularly, from next week to Valentine's Day 
to May Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coup fever," Lt. Col. Pol Lacerna said wearily. "It's a product of 
imagination and disinformation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rumor Alert Center 
</P>
<P>
Lacerna should know. He helps run the Rumor Alert Center at Camp Aguinaldo, 
headquarters of the Department of Defense. Despite the title, the center is not 
always alert: Ringing phones are often ignored, and its telephone numbers seem 
to change constantly. 
</P>
<P>
People who manage to get through on the telephone range from the curious to the 
hysterical. A woman frantically reported heavy fighting at Ft. Bonifacio. What 
she had heard were youngsters' firecrackers. An elderly man saw an armored 
personnel carrier filled with rebel soldiers, which turned out to be a pickup 
truck carrying two soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Another caller told of civilians fleeing shelling at Camp Aguinaldo, apparently 
forgetting that she was calling Camp Aguinaldo. 
</P>
<P>
"We just laughed," Lacerna said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, people are on edge. On a recent Sunday night, an American 
television network alerted its crews when someone reported barricades going up 
outside Aquino's residence. The barricades, as it turned out, were for a 
religious parade two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter spent five hours Wednesday night checking a tip that 500 mutinous 
troops were marching toward Cagayan province in the north to rescue Gov. 
Rodolfo Aguinaldo, a rebel supporter who has refused to leave his office 
despite a 60-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is happening here," Aguinaldo said when he was finally reached by 
phone. "I haven't even heard the rumor." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that the term "rumor control" is an oxymoron in the 
Philippines. Gossip -- tsismis in Tagalog -- is standard fare in the coffee 
shops and at business lunches, even in government announcements. In most 
newspapers, rumor is routinely reported as fact until proved otherwise. 
Usually, rumors are reported and then forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Death That Wasn't 
</P>
<P>
For example, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos was repeatedly reported dead 
long before his death last Sept. 28 in Hawaii. One newspaper reported his death 
in April, 1988, then recovered with a story headlined, "Marcos Denies Death 
Rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Every new round of coup rumors sends the peso lower, the black market higher 
and jitters into Manila's two stock exchanges, where prices are off 18% since 
the coup. 
</P>
<P>
"Some investors take these things seriously," broker Irving I. Ackerman 
fretted. "People get scared." 
</P>
<P>
There is reason, of course. In interviews and letters, rebel leaders have 
warned that Aquino's recent Cabinet shake-up and her appointment of a 
presidential investigating commission will not remedy the corruption and 
ineptitude they say is endemic. They demand that she resign and that the United 
States abandon immediately the six military facilities it has in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the best-known coup plotter, cashiered army Lt. Col. Gregorio 
(Gringo) Honasan, wrote an open letter to newspapers attacking the "thieves and 
highwaymen" in Aquino's government and blaming her "yellow army" for the 
casualties -- 113 deaths and more than 500 wounded -- in the December coup 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Honasan said he has "no choice except to launch . . . Phase 2, otherwise known 
as 'Peaceful, Constitutional and Democratic Rescue' of the republic." In other 
words, another coup. 
</P>
<P>
After the December uprising, fewer than half of the estimated 3,000 soldiers 
who took part returned to barracks or surrendered. All but majors and above 
have been sent back to their units. A fugitive rebel leader, in between 
meetings with reporters, is said to have sent home for his golf clubs and a 
maid to do his laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Since the coup, the National Bureau of Investigation has recommended filing 
charges against more than 50 businessmen, former military officers, former 
government aides and others who are believed to have supported the coup. None 
have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos insists that he is determined to punish the 
rebels, despite a public perception that nothing of the sort is being done. 
</P>
<P>
"I rebut widespread impressions that officers and soldiers have been getting 
off with light penalties in connection with failed coup attempts, such as 
push-ups," Ramos told reporters. "The push-ups were punishments inflicted upon 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Tuesday to Manila police, Aquino warned that another coup is likely 
and could well succeed. The nation lives "under a shadow of fear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western diplomat agreed. "We still think it's a dangerous period," he 
said Thursday. "These guys are still on the loose. They are still regrouping. . 
. . Frankly, I'm not optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Neither is a Philippine air force general who fought for Aquino in the December 
coup attempt. Although his troops remained loyal, he polled 100 officers and 
enlisted men after the fighting and found that two-thirds either support 
another coup or would remain neutral if there should be one. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very disturbing," he said. "Most of the men are sitting on the fence. 
There's a feeling among middle- and lower-level commanders that the country is 
not being run properly." 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts give the coup plotters about six months to make their move. After 
that, they say, attention will focus on the 1992 presidential election. Aquino 
has already said she will not run. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the military faces an overhaul. More than a score of generals will 
retire or step down, including the commanders of the army, marines, navy and 
air force, and four of the six regional commanders. Who replaces them may be 
key. 
</P>
<P>
When will the next coup come? Lt. Col. Lacerna of the Rumor Alert Center 
advised: "Pick all the dates of the calendar. One of them could be right."

EGYPTIAN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR ANTI-EXTREMIST STAND

Egypt's powerful interior minister was dismissed Friday after reportedly urging 
the violent elimination of Muslim extremists, who represent one of the 
strongest challenges to the moderate government of President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's dismissal of Zaki Badr, the tough, outspoken director of Egypt's 
internal security forces, followed two days of controversy over remarks, 
reported in opposition newspapers, that Badr allegedly made at two recent 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Badr reportedly said he wanted to kill Muslim fundamentalists who have opposed 
Egypt's moderate government and have urged the implementation of conservative 
Islamic laws and strict social controls. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to kill only 1% of the population," Badr was quoted as saying, 
apparently including in his remarks even members of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
which holds several seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks reportedly were recorded on tape by the Socialist Labor Party 
newspaper Al Shaab. 
</P>
<P>
Badr was said to have unleashed a stream of abuse at Egyptian journalists, 
opposition politicians, lawyers and Muslim scholars, including some of his 
colleagues in the Cabinet, calling them sons of dogs, thieves, homosexuals and 
cart drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In other comments, published by the Paris-based newspaper Al Watan Al Arabi, 
Badr said of the Islamic extremists, "I see them as mad dogs -- with all 
respect to dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's decision to fire Badr follows months of controversy over the Interior 
Ministry's tough crackdown on fundamentalists in Egypt, resulting in thousands 
of arrests, tear-gas assaults on mosques and reports by human rights 
organizations of political prisoners being tortured. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Badr, 63, survived what appeared to be an assassination attempt 
when a car bomb exploded just before he arrived at a police recreational 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The incident followed the arrest of 500 Muslim fundamentalists a week earlier 
in the southern province of Assiut, a hotbed of Muslim extremism for years. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition politicians for months have been calling for Mubarak to rein in the 
Interior Ministry, which recently has detained large numbers of journalists, 
writers and university professors based on allegations that they were 
Communists. The arrests sparked outcries from human rights groups around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here say that, while it is not surprising that Mubarak 
dismissed the controversial minister, it is widely believed that Mubarak 
quietly supported Badr's tough approach toward Islamic fundamentalists, who 
many believe represent a growing threat to stability in Egypt as economic 
conditions steadily worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed to replace Badr was Mohammed Abdel-Halim Moussa, a career police 
officer whose approach has been more conciliatory than confrontational.

A top aide to Mayor Marion Barry allegedly promised to deliver a city contract 
to an undercover FBI agent posing as a private contractor if the man first 
contributed to Barry's 1986 reelection effort, according to court documents 
unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, former city human services head David E. Rivers, allegedly told 
an undercover FBI agent during an October, 1986, meeting that he would be 
awarded a contract if he contributed money to a Barry reelection fund-raising 
effort Rivers was organizing in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
According to the court records, Rivers said: "Ya'll just do this," gesturing to 
invitations to the fund raiser, "It's (the contract) done right now." 
</P>
<P>
The court records were unsealed after a hearing in which a federal judge denied 
a request by Rivers and prominent city contractor John Clyburn that wiretap 
evidence gathered against them be suppressed in their trial on bribery and 
conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations against Rivers and Clyburn are the latest in a long string that 
have been lodged against people close to the mayor.

Four people believed to be members of the Irish Republican Army were arrested 
Friday while attempting to purchase a heat-seeking anti-aircraft missile and 
other weapons, the FBI announced. 
</P>
<P>
The four, believed to be members of the Provisional faction of the IRA, were 
trying to gather weapons for terrorist activities outside the United States, 
said William Gavin, who heads the FBI office in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests of Irish nationals Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, Seamus Moley, 30, and 
Joseph McColgan, 39, and a Canadian, Sean John McCann, 34, concluded a 
two-month undercover investigation, said officials of the FBI, the U.S. Customs 
Service and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moley went to a West Palm Beach warehouse and paid undercover agents 
$50,000 for a "Stinger" missile, a shoulder-fired weapon supplied by the United 
States to troops for anti-aircraft defense, an FBI statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was fired at an airliner it could blow it right out of the sky, so one 
of these missiles could cause an extreme amount of damage," said Timothy 
Wagner, head of the Customs Service in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stinger missile is a surface-to-air missile that is used against aircraft. 
So one would have to believe that if they expressed an interest in procuring 
this type of weaponry, they planned a terrorist act, obviously against an 
aircraft," added Robert Creighton, who heads the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms office in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Each defendant was charged with conspiracy to possess destructive arms, 
possession of a destructive device and violations of the Arms Export Control 
Act and the Neutrality Law. Each faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in 
fines if convicted, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a poor Irishman here on holiday, and I was entrapped by certain 
people here," McColgan said in a thick brogue as he was led in handcuffs from 
the federal courthouse. "Certain people here offered to sell me a piece of 
equipment for the Irish Republican struggle." 
</P>
<P>
In a series of meetings, the suspects revealed details about past terrorist 
activities to convince federal agents they were involved in terrorism and 
serious about buying the missile, the authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they met with our undercover agents, they described in detail events 
which occurred outside of the country -- which did occur -- and we believed 
absolutely they were involved," Creighton said. 
</P>
<P>
All four men were held without bond at the Palm Beach County Jail and were 
scheduled for a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Ann E. Vitunac in West Palm 
Beach on Tuesday.

U.S., SOVIETS AGREE TO JOINTLY STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union signed new agreements on Friday to 
jointly study climate change, ozone depletion, wetlands management, arctic 
ecology and other environmental concerns, officials announced here. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, U.S. scientists soon will board Soviet research vessels to 
conduct joint atmospheric studies in the South Pacific, EPA Administrator 
William K. Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, cooperative studies will soon get under way to assess the degree of 
global warming, he and a Soviet environmental official announced. "Our 
countries cover a large mass of the Northern Hemisphere, and we can make 
absolutely essential contributions," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached at the 12th meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint 
Committee on Cooperation in Environmental Protection, which was created in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
At a news media briefing, Valentin G. Sokolovsky, a senior Soviet environmental 
official, detailed new Soviet initiatives to combat pollution in his country, 
calling them "radical perestroika." Among them, he said, are an emerging system 
to tax and fine polluters and the recent creation of a broadly based citizens' 
group to advise the government on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolovsky said also that the Soviet State Committee for Environmental 
Protection intends to combat urban air pollution, which he said is among the 
country's "most dangerous" problems. 
</P>
<P>
In no less than 103 cities, he said, air pollution is often 10 times the legal 
limit. Sixty-eight additional cities have "rather steady violations of air 
pollution norms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing source of such pollution, Sokolovsky said, is the automobile. In 
more than 250 cities, he said, auto emissions now are more responsible for air 
pollution than industry emissions. As a result, Sokolovsky said, plans are 
being developed to ban leaded gasoline altogether, either by 1996 or 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly hailed the Soviet environmental initiatives, calling the Soviets' 
pollution problems "serious, difficult and daunting." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sokolovsky had given Reilly a document that the EPA boss called "the 
very first Soviet state of the environment report ever to be published." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets' newly created Citizens Advisory Council is made up of 150 
environmental activists, scientists, architects, journalists, trade unionists 
and artists, among others, according to Sokolovsky, who is first deputy 
chairman of the State Committee on Environmental Protection. He said six of the 
members have been elected to the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
The collaborative environmental studies will include not only government 
agencies but numerous scientific organizations, academic institutions and trade 
associations.

The voice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rang out once more at the Lincoln 
Memorial on Friday as government officials and schoolchildren joined in a 
birthday observance highlighted by a recording of the slain civil rights 
leader's "I have a dream" speech. 
</P>
<P>
"As we stand here again in the place where he stood, we can feel his presence," 
James M. Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, told a crowd of 
several hundred assembled in chilly, windy weather at the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
King was shot to death on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. Had he lived, he 
would be 61 on Monday. His speech at the memorial was the climax of a civil 
rights march in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Effi Barry, wife of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, blinked back tears 
as the recording came to the climax of King's speech, ending with the words, 
"free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, we are free at last." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Mrs. Barry joined Ridenour and two children representing District of 
Columbia schools in laying three floral wreaths at the memorial in honor of 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. told an overflow crowd in the 
850-seat Interior Department auditorium, "If Dr. King were alive today, he 
would be marching hand in hand in the war against drugs, fighting to stop the 
next generation from destroying itself. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no opportunities for people addicted to drugs. There is no dream," 
Lujan said. "There is only the nightmare of the fatal consequences of drug 
use."

JUDGE CAN'T JAIL ILLINOIS TOWN, SO HE PUTS IT ON PROBATION

A judge on Friday placed the financially troubled city of East St. Louis on one 
year of probation for potentially endangering its police officers by not 
repairing their squad car radios. 
</P>
<P>
The city was convicted on Jan. 4 of reckless conduct. That was the city's 
second reckless conduct conviction in three months and only the third such 
conviction known against a city in Illinois in more than 75 years, St. Clair 
County State's Atty. John Baricevic said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has made a minor effort to improve the situation," Baricevic said. "I 
do not know that everybody has a radio. I do know that many police officers 
have bought their own radios." 
</P>
<P>
The city had also been charged with reckless conduct for allowing police cars 
to fall into disrepair, but it was not found guilty on that charge. Baricevic 
originally filed the charges against the city in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because a city cannot be given a jail term, it faced a maximum fine of $1,000 
on the reckless conduct charge. Baricevic recommended a token $1 fine because 
of the city's huge debt, estimated at $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, St. Clair County Associate Judge Robert P. LeChien placed the city on 
probation for one year. He said the city should be checked regularly to ensure 
that it is keeping its radios and patrol cars in good condition. The city was 
also assessed court and probation costs. 
</P>
<P>
LeChien said the evidence showed that there is "pervasive potential for danger 
to police officers due to faulty equipment." 
</P>
<P>
"I find, in aggravation, that the city has not met the obligation of protecting 
its citizens," LeChien said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has 30 days to appeal, he said. The city's attorney, Irvin Williamson, 
said that an appeal was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge went as far as he could," Baricevic said after the hearing. "The 
city deserves to go to jail, but that is physically . . . impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joseph McCaskill, vice president of the city's police union, refused to 
comment on the sentence until it could be discussed with other union officers. 
</P>
<P>
Some new patrol cars have been bought, but the city still fails to keep 
gasoline in them or have the tires repaired, Baricevic noted. "But the mayor 
(Carl Officer) still gets tip-top dollar for operation for his car." 
</P>
<P>
East St. Louis was convicted in October of reckless conduct for a sewer system 
failure that flooded a high school with raw sewage. In that case, Associate 
Judge C. Glenn Stevens waived the fine because of the city's debt. 
</P>
<P>
The last known case in which a city was found guilty on a similar charge was in 
1912, when Chicago was convicted of reckless conduct for improper operation of 
a municipal hospital.

DEUKMEJIAN REJECTS EXTENSION OF QUAKE LEVY

Gov. George Deukmejian made it emphatically clear Friday that his willingness 
to compromise on the budget does not extend to a suggestion by Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown that the temporary sales tax increase enacted last November for 
earthquake relief be kept on the books to head off state spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor said "it would be a very big mistake for the 
Legislature to support that. I think it would further impair their 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
In other remarks during a luncheon speech to the Sacramento Press Club, 
Deukmejian declared that: 
</P>
<P>
Movement toward a compromise on a $24-million cutback in family planning funds 
is jeopardized by a legal fight that he said now centers on the separation of 
powers between the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government. 
"I'm not going to be taking a position on any particular piece of legislation 
pending the outcome of that litigation," the governor vowed. 
</P>
<P>
Six Southern California counties will get more than half of new federal 
anti-drug enforcement money going to local law enforcement agencies because 
they are "areas where the problem is the most severe." 
</P>
<P>
His proposal to require mandatory earthquake insurance would not apply to all 
property owners in quake-sensitive areas, only to those in older homes and 
buildings not built to modern standards. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's comments on the temporary sales tax increase come on the heels of 
the Assembly Speaker's suggestion Thursday that he might consider extending the 
13-month, quarter-cent levy, now scheduled to end Dec. 31 after it raises $785 
million for earthquake programs. 
</P>
<P>
"(The initial tax increase) was proposed and it was voted upon and it was 
enacted on the basis that it was for 13 months and to be used for help with the 
rebuilding after the earthquake," Deukmejian said. "I think it ought to be kept 
to that and the promise ought to be kept to the people." 
</P>
<P>
The governor added, "I don't think that he (Brown) is going to get any support 
for a major tax increase bill, especially this year, in an election year." 
</P>
<P>
And in the latest twist in the fight over family planning funds, Deukmejian 
said the dispute has been broadened to a legal fight over the constitutional 
powers of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to the issue of the governor's authority on the line-item veto and it 
also goes to the issue of whether or not a trial court can order state 
government to spend more money than has actually been appropriated for a 
particular program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he will refuse to discuss proposals to restore the $24 million 
in funds he vetoed from the budget last July because of a suit filed by health 
providers and legal advocates for the poor. Deukmejian's new budget contains 
just $12.8 million for family planning programs, nearly two-thirds less than 
the $36 million they were targeted for last year. 
</P>
<P>
The family planning programs provide a variety of medical, counseling and 
educational services, ranging from pregnancy testing to cancer screening and 
dispensing of birth control information. The program got caught up in the fight 
over abortion. Deukmejian also insists that family planning funds now are used 
to provide a variety of medical services that he argues go well beyond their 
original mission. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's question, Deukmejian said once again that "the $12 
million that is in the budget is certainly adequate to provide the true family 
planning-type services." 
</P>
<P>
The governor used the Press Club forum to announce that the bulk of new federal 
grants for drug enforcement programs will go to Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to focus our drug enforcement resources in the areas where the 
problem is the worst -- and where we can get the most bang for our bucks," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the state will get $39.7 million in new federal drug money. Of that, 
$25.5 million will be spread among local governments. Los Angeles County would 
receive $7 million; San Diego County, $2.4 million; Orange County, $1.2 
million; San Bernardino County, $738,000; Riverside County, $575,000, and 
Imperial County, $397,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said his plan for mandatory quake insurance would apply to all 
buildings that "are not up to earthquake standards." Newer homes and commercial 
buildings, he said, have shown they can withstand a quake. The governor said 
the proposal will be fleshed out after talks with insurance industry officials, 
members of the Legislature and other interested parties.

500 FLEE BLAST AT PETROLEUM CENTER 
</P>

An explosion and fire at a petroleum distribution center just east of this 
rural Ventura County community forced the evacuation of about 500 area 
residents Friday, but no one was injured, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said that there was an explosion in a shed area at the Clark 
Corp., about a half mile east of town, shortly after 7 p.m. The cause of the 
blast was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Department Dispatcher Vicki Crabtree said a tanker truck driver, 
who had been unloading gasoline nearby, managed to shut off the tanker's valves 
and run for his life. His truck was not involved in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Flames from 50 to 100 feet high glowed orange against the rainy sky. 
</P>
<P>
About 85 firefighters, manning 17 engines, three support units, and a hazardous 
materials squad responded and battled the fire for more than an hour. There was 
no immediate estimate of damages. 
</P>
<P>
At the evacuation center set up by the Red Cross at Santa Paula High School, 
Manuel Aguilar, a Santa Paula resident who lives near the Clark property, said 
he was baby-sitting his nephews when he heard an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"The house shook, and I looked outside and there was a huge column of smoke 
about 100 feet high, and a ball of fire in the sky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar said he and his nephews, ages 7 and 8, ran outside, and were told by 
firefighters to evacuate the area.

BIDDING WAR LOOMS FOR ANAHEIM, LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE and ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
The Walt Disney Co., which has for months tempted Long Beach with plans of 
building a new amusement park around the Queen Mary, announced Friday that it 
is also considering Anaheim for the billion-dollar attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends a lot on which community wants us more," Walt Disney Co. Chairman 
Michael D. Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected announcement, made during a press conference in Anaheim, sets up 
a bidding war between the two cities for a second Disneyland of sorts, a theme 
park that promises to boost the local tax base, provide 10,000 jobs and bring 
the tourists swarming. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I have the first opportunity before Long Beach to say the answer is 'yes, 
yes, yes!' " Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor of Anaheim can say 'yes, yes, yes' to Disney, but he can't say 'yes, 
yes, yes' to an open checkbook," Long Beach Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton 
countered in an interview later, pointing out that neither city is equipped to 
give Disney a blank check when they have not been told how much the project 
might cost them. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials have been meeting with Disney executives behind closed 
doors for months, discussing a nautical park that would wrap around the Queen 
Mary and Spruce Goose attractions in the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner would not give details of Disney's plans for the theme or size of the 
new attraction, saying it depends on which site is ultimately selected. 
</P>
<P>
Disney, which has spent millions of dollars studying construction of a 
$1-billion theme park in Long Beach, was expected to announce this month 
whether it planned to make a commitment. Instead, Eisner tossed the ball in the 
air, saying the city that presents the best plan for handling traffic and 
parking for the massive project can close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials suggested that they would do almost anything to win, 
including providing off-site transportation and parking to move people in and 
out of the new park. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim is ready to cut any deal we'll have to," City Councilman Irv Pickler 
said. "If we haven't given that message to Disneyland, we are going to give it 
to Disneyland real soon." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials said they have considered building an ocean landfill, 
offering tax exemptions and constructing parking garages to appease Disney. But 
they have moved with caution, vowing to first study the planned park's impact 
on the city's economy, traffic flow, parking and quality of life before 
deciding how much they will spend to bring the amusement park giant to town. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow ourselves to do something foolish because of what may or may 
not be some competitive bidding," Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said. "It has got 
to be a plus for us as well as Disneyland. If we end up with more traffic and 
more smog -- those days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the announcement, the competitors were sizing each other up. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim has nearly four times as many hotels and motels citywide and its 
convention center is nine times larger, city officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, on the other hand, has the 710 Freeway, one of the least traveled 
corridors in the Los Angeles area ending at the Queen Mary's door, and a light 
rail line on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Kell contended that his city holds another trump card -- the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have real good vision to see the ocean from Anaheim," Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came 24 hours after Disney executives briefed Kell and other 
top administrators in Long Beach about their plans for developing the 55-acre 
Queen Mary site that Disney now leases and an additional 256 acres of 
surrounding water on which it holds a lease option. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling Anaheim into the fray did not faze Long Beach officials, who said 
Disney negotiators are "extremely shrewd" and are maneuvering to make the best 
deal possible by playing one city off the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's business, man," Long Beach City Councilman Les Robbins said. "May 
the best city win." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Mary Lou Fulton in Anaheim contributed to this story.

TADEUSZ BRZEZINSKI; FORMER POLISH CONSUL GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tadeusz Brzezinski, 94, the Polish government-in-exile's consul general in 
Montreal during World War II. The father of Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. 
national security adviser, was consul general from 1938 until the Communist 
takeover of his homeland at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
He served as president of the Polish-Canadian Congress from 1952 to 1962, and 
in 1975 helped create the World Polish Congress. Brzezinski was born in 
Zloczow, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and now in the Soviet Union. 
As a volunteer in the Polish independence movement from 1918 to 1920, 
Brzezinski saw action in the battle of Lvov and against Soviet forces in the 
final Warsaw campaign of 1920. He then served as a Polish diplomat for the 
nascent Polish Republic in Germany, France, the Soviet Ukraine and Canada. 
While in Leipzig, Germany, before World War II, Brzezinski became involved in 
efforts to rescue European Jews from Nazi concentration camps. In 1978, his 
efforts on behalf of the Jewish people were recognized by Israeli Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin. In Montreal on Sunday.

MOTHER SLAIN, GIRL AIDS IN SEIZING SUSPECT

<P>
Barefoot, dirty and frightened, three young children wandered up to the Mission 
Bay visitor's center and told a horrifying story of how their mother was 
brutally killed by a courthouse security guard she had turned to in a desperate 
plea for help for her homeless family. 
</P>
<P>
The ingenuity of the oldest child, a 10-year-old girl, who kept notes of their 
three days with the stranger, led to the arrest Friday of 31-year-old Kevin 
Kulo, a private security guard at the downtown San Diego County Courthouse. The 
girl was able to describe to police how Kulo allegedly beat her mother, put her 
body in a bag and dumped it off Murphy Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the girls, ages 10 and 4, and their 2-year-old brother apparently 
witnessed the death of their mother, Mary Jo Zavala, 34. Police are also 
investigating the oldest girl's report that she was allegedly handcuffed by 
Kulo after she jumped on his back when he tried to rape her 4-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the cases we deal with are tragic enough," said homicide Lt. Gary 
Learn. "But when you get children involved, that adds another whole dimension." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Jardine, the owner of the Mission Bay Visitor's Information Center, broke 
into tears Friday when he described how the oldest girl, waiting for police in 
his office Thursday, doodled on a note pad these words: "Mom come back" and 
"Kevin, you'll pay for this." 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at her and then saw all these strained looks on everybody's face, and 
tears were coming down all the cheeks of our employees," he said. "It was gut 
wrenching." 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the information the 10-year-old girl gave police, Learn said, 
"Her help was very crucial." 
</P>
<P>
He said she provided a detailed description of the suspect, the color of his 
uniform and specifics about his blue car and brown-and-white trailer, all of 
which were pivotal in helping authorities locate Kulo on Friday morning in El 
Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested inside the trailer while it was parked near Orange and Cypress 
avenues. By Friday night, he was booked on suspicion of murder and was being 
held in the downtown County Jail, where he had worked as a private security 
guard under contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said Kulo was a member of the Equity Security force and had 
worked on and off for the county since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kulo had no permanent address and lived in his trailer, often 
moving to different locations within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the children told detectives that their mother took her family 
to the courthouse Tuesday, where she approached Kulo, and sought his help for 
her homeless family. 
</P>
<P>
"They apparently started up a short relationship after they met," Learn said. 
</P>
<P>
Zavala's body was found about 1 p.m. Wednesday, in the gulch off Interstate 15 
and Murphy Canyon Road. The children remained with Kulo Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest girl said Kulo dropped them off Thursday at Mission Bay. Workers at 
the Mission Bay visitors center said they spotted the children about 1 p.m. 
outside their booth near Interstate 5 and Clairemont Drive. The kids were 
barefoot, their clothing full of dirt and sand. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest girl had a book with her notes and several dollars folded inside. 
Police said the girl told them that the money had come from the man who killed 
her mother. She also said that she had promised him that she would not tell 
anyone what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
But she told police that she had also promised God that she would never lie.

JUDGE FREES PAIR ON KIDNAPING COUNTS;

<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday freed a Santa Cruz couple accused of kidnaping 
and falsely imprisoning their adult daughter in an attempt to "deprogram" her 
religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David B. Moon Jr. dismissed all charges against Earle and Dorothy Brown, 
both 58. They had been charged with illegally abducting their daughter, Ginger, 
in an unsuccessful attempt to get her to disavow her allegiance to a group 
known as Great Among the Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Moon also dismissed charges against another Brown daughter, Holly, 25, and two 
other co-defendants, deprogrammer Clifford Daniels, 35, of Los Angeles, and 
Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido for their roles in the case. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Moon's jury had acquitted some of the defendants on lesser 
charges, but on Thursday jurors told Moon that they were hopelessly deadlocked 
on the kidnaping charges against the elder Browns, their daughter and the 
deprogrammer. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office charged that Ginger Brown, 22 
at the time, had been abducted from an Encinitas parking lot and held against 
her will. Ginger Brown was freed five days later, returned to her group and 
served as the prosecution's star witness against her own parents and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-member Coronado-based Great Among the Nations describes itself as a 
fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry. Parents of current 
and former members have called it a cult whose members are insidiously 
influenced to finance the comfortable life style of its leader, Benjamin 
Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants had not denied their actions, but claimed that they were baited 
to kidnap Ginger Brown so she and her leader could sue them for monetary 
damages to finance their group. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday -- after Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said he was ready to retry 
the defendants on the hung counts and to continue his prosecution of them on 
several yet untried charges of conspiracy -- Moon ruled instead that further 
prosecution would be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps a jury might reach a unanimous not-guilty verdict," Moon said, "but 
this judge isn't going to let the people's courtroom, of which we have precious 
few, be used to titillate the public's fascination with unusual religious 
groups. We have other pressing business to transact in our trial courts." 
</P>
<P>
Earle Brown said afterward that he is still "really concerned about Ginger and 
her well-being -- and for other parents with children in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown, meanwhile, has filed a $2.5-million lawsuit against her parents 
and the others involved in the deprogramming attempt.

THIS TIME THEIR TEARS WERE FOR JOY

<P>
The two brothers embraced for more than a minute, both approaching tears, while 
cameras clicked and television lights glared as a 15-year separation that began 
with the fall of Saigon came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of Arrival Area B at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday 
morning, Tuoi Nguyen of Oceanside was reunited with his brother, Cuong Huu 
Nguyen, who had just been released from a Vietnamese "re-education camp" after 
serving 6 1/2 years of an eight-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 friends and relatives were on hand to greet Cuong Nguyen and Ha Hieu 
Ho, Christian ministers and cellmates in Vietnam, and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Among the well-wishers were 30 Vietnamese ministers from the West Coast and 
Canada, including representatives of four of the five Vietnamese churches in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't expect this many people," Cuong Nguyen said through tears. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, who will live with a nephew in Poway, and Ho were the first former 
Vietnamese political prisoners allowed to emigrate to the United States under 
an accord reached in July between Washington and Hanoi after seven years of 
negotiations. About 700 former prisoners from Vietnam are expected to arrive in 
the United States by the end of January, according to the State Department, 
many of them in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Yet neither Nguyen nor Ho wanted to leave his country. Each would have 
preferred to take his ministry to the Vietnamese people. 
</P>
<P>
"Persecution as a Christian minister is a matter of fact in a communist 
country. I was prepared for that," said Nguyen, 49, whose Saigon church was 
shut down when he was arrested in 1983. "I feel happy about being persecuted 
for my faith. It is a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"The arrest of ministers has strengthened the faith of the church members 
because they come closer to God, and through their faith and their prayers, God 
has been working." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, who said he was not mistreated in prison, said he and Ho quietly 
converted more than 200 people to Christianity while in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, Christianity has been oppressed in Vietnam, and Christians meeting 
in private homes rely on tourists to smuggle in Bibles. Nguyen does not see 
that oppression ending. 
</P>
<P>
He and Ho were the only two ministers in the first wave of 300 freed political 
prisoners who will come to the United States in the next week. Mechanical 
problems with the airplane that was to take the 300 to Tokyo prevented all but 
Nguyen, Ho and their families from making the Friday flight. Another flight had 
15 open seats, and Nguyen and Ho were among the lucky ones to get on. 
</P>
<P>
One welcomer who served three years in the prison camps and then escaped the 
country in 1980 recalled some of his experiences with Nguyen as a Christian in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of hard times together after the fall of Saigon," said Luc 
Nguyen, who, with Cuong Nguyen, had led a Christian youth group that flourished 
during that country's civil war. Luc, no relation, now lives in Garden Grove 
and operates a construction firm. "We got together after I got out of camp just 
to fellowship together, and the communist government nearly put me back into 
the camps." 
</P>
<P>
To some, the release of Nguyen and Ho was a surprise, although those who had 
been working closely with the State Department said it had been expected for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
But Sinh Nguyen, Cuong Nguyen's nephew, said he had stopped listening to 
promises of a release from the Vietnam government. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been promising for so long now," Sinh Nguyen said. "I did not 
believe it until he got to Bangkok." 
</P>
<P>
For brother Tuoi Nguyen, the anticipation of Cuong's arrival was 
nerve-wracking. 
</P>
<P>
Friday started at 4 a.m. for Tuoi, 57. He couldn't sleep. He knew the flight 
wasn't to arrive until 5 1/2 hours later and that immigration would take at 
least another hour. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the moon still high in the sky and the colors of sunrise making only 
a faint impression, he and his wife left their Oceanside house to start the 
two-hour trip. 
</P>
<P>
After a stop in Westminster to pick up his daughter, Bich Loan, and her family, 
they were back on Interstate 405. The heavy traffic made Tuoi Nguyen visibly 
anxious as he wrung his hands and frequently checked his watch. "Will we be 
late?" he asked, despite the early hour. 
</P>
<P>
A picture published in The Times of his brother and Ho at the Tokyo airport 
only whetted his appetite. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks good. He looks very good," Tuoi Nguyen said, although he could not 
tell for certain whether his brother had lost weight, noting only that his face 
looked a little thinner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's thin and skinny, but he's smiling," said Tuoi's sister Nga Nguyen Do, who 
had flown from Seattle to greet her brother. Do also had not seen Nguyen since 
1975, when she fled Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Nephews, nieces and grandchildren too young to know Nguyen but old enough to 
understand what he has accomplished nodded reverently at the picture. 
</P>
<P>
When Do saw him in person, her eyes filled with tears as they hugged. 
</P>
<P>
And Nguyen, despite his reservations about leaving Vietnam, said he is glad to 
have found a new home. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to express my appreciation for the people who have been working 
for my release and bringing me to the United States," he said, "and my 
appreciation to the American people that they will receive me here."

ALL CHARGES IN BROWN KIDNAP CASE DISMISSED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE CHARGES NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME TO TRIAL, THE JUDGE TELLS STUNNED 
ATTORNEYS ON BOTH SIDES IN THE RELIGIOUS DEPROGRAMMING ATTEMPT ON GINGER BROWN. 
</P>

<P>
In an abrupt conclusion to the Ginger Brown kidnaping trial, Superior Court 
Judge David B. Moon Jr. on Friday dismissed the kidnaping and other charges 
against all five defendants, including the woman's parents, Earle and Dorothy 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in June, when I reviewed the entire file, I said to myself, 'Why is this 
case, at least to the Browns, in our criminal courts?' " Moon said Friday 
morning, surprising attorneys for both sides, who had gathered to argue whether 
charges that led to a hung jury on Thursday should be retried. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Moon told them he didn't see any reason to try the case further. "This 
judge finds that no jury of 12 persons is ever going to unanimously agree on 
guilty verdicts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of a prosecution on the remaining counts is virtually 
non-existent. Perhaps a jury might reach a unanimous not-guilty verdict, but 
this judge isn't going to let the people's courtroom, of which we have precious 
few, be used to titillate the public's fascination with unusual religious 
groups. We have other pressing business to transact in our trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Constitution admonishes me to conduct a fair trial; it authorizes me to 
protect the rights of criminally accused, and it expects me to curb excessive 
government action. 
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, I conclude that further prosecution of these defendants on 
outstanding charges would serve no legal purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The five defendants hugged, cried and smiled; the defense attorneys grinned and 
shook their heads, and the district attorney's office shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, everybody in this case did his or her job," said Steven J. Casey, 
special assistant to Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller. "We're obliged to uphold the 
law. Nobody in a free community is going to tolerate a society where anyone can 
be Big Brother and rip someone off the streets when they disagree with them 
philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
"The court's job is to give the defendants and the victim a fair trial," Casey 
said. "Ultimately, it's the community's job to speak out on this case -- and 
essentially the whole sorry story of alienated families -- and the jury has 
done that. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps their failure to reach a decision tells a great deal about the deep 
ambivalence we have as a society, between family duty and personal freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Charged with kidnaping, false imprisonment and battery were the elder Browns; 
one of their four daughters, Holly, 25; Los Angeles deprogrammer Clifford 
Daniels, 35, and Hank Erler, 23, in whose mother's Escondido home the 
unsuccessful five-day deprogramming attempt occurred in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The jury Wednesday acquitted Erler of most of the charges facing him, and 
pronounced not-guilty verdicts on false-imprisonment and battery against the 
two Brown women. But Thursday, jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked on 
the remaining charges, including kidnaping, against the three Browns and 
Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
The five defendants never denied abducting and holding Ginger Brown for five 
days to try to get her to disavow her allegiance to a group known as Great 
Among the Nations. But they argued that they were baited to do it by Ginger 
Brown and the group's leader, Benjamin Altschul, so the daughter could later 
sue the defendants for monetary damages to help bankroll the small group. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-member, Coronado-based Great Among the Nations describes itself as a 
fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry, although parents of 
current and former members say it is a cult whose members are insidiously 
influenced to finance the comfortable life style of its leader. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown was freed on the fifth day of the deprogramming effort and 
returned to her group. She was the prosecution's star witness against her 
parents and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who was 22 at the time, testified that she was bruised and battered 
during the deprogramming attempt. The defense argued that most of her injuries 
were self-inflicted so she could improve her case. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Friday that she accepts Moon's ruling. "I laid out my case to the 
court, the jury and the judge. It was up to them. It's time to go on with my 
life and my ministery," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said afterward that the very issue of whether Ginger Brown actually 
baited the kidnaping and consented to it was the key to their deliberations, 
and those who voted for acquittal said they didn't believe Ginger Brown's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we agreed on was that nobody believed Ginger told the truth," 
juror Jim Lambert said. "There were so many inconsistencies, we just didn't 
believe her." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We all agreed we were dealing with a cult." But he said some jurors 
"seemed to have chips on their shoulders because of their problems with their 
own parents" and weren't ready to wholly support the elder Browns, either. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors noted that all four women on the jury voted across the board to acquit 
all the defendants on all the charges, but most said sympathy for the parents 
wasn't an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed the Browns had evidence (their daughter was in jeopardy), even 
though we didn't have that evidence ourselves," said Paula DeMong, the 
presiding juror. "We saw it as a group that wouldn't allow Ginger to see her 
family. No one felt that the motives of Great Among the Nations were 
particularly honest." 
</P>
<P>
DeMong said that, if she didn't believe Ginger Brown had consented to the 
kidnaping, "I would have voted to convict them -- with great sadness." 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors said they were struck by Ginger Brown's emotionless, matter-of-fact 
testimony against her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"She seemed so odd. It made the jury curious, that she wasn't experiencing 
normal emotions, which we felt added weight to the brainwashing," DeMong said. 
</P>
<P>
She said jurors were bothered after viewing a videotape of Ginger Brown, taken 
by fellow group members after her release, that showed her laughing and joking 
about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown said she was not bothered by their criticism. "There has been such 
slander against our group for the past two years that I'm beginning to get 
thick-skinned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's proceedings started with Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel telling Moon 
he was ready to retry the defendants on the hung counts and to continue his 
prosecution of them on several yet untried charges of conspiracy -- charges 
that were held in abeyance until the first charges were tried and resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But Moon brought the discussion to a quick culmination, telling defense 
attorneys not to even bother to argue that charges should be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a 20-minute lecture in which he criticized both the defense and 
prosecution for some of their trial tactics and missed opportunities, Moon said 
he was dropping the remaining charges and was ready for everyone to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Moon said he found fault with the case from the outset, but claimed he lacked 
the judicial discretion to unilaterally dismiss the major counts against the 
defendants -- especially after Earle Brown took the stand in his own defense 
and "virtually admitted every element of the crime and implicated each of his 
co-defendants," despite "deficiencies in the prosecution's prima facie case." 
</P>
<P>
Had the defendants asked that the judge rule on the case instead of putting the 
facts in the hands of a jury, Moon said, he might have ended the proceedings 
shortly after they started, back in November. But instead, he said, he had to 
let the jury process run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"This prosecution will never, and I mean never ever, be stronger than it was at 
the conclusion of the defense case," Moon said. "To put it succinctly, if the 
district attorney couldn't get a conviction from this evidence, they will never 
get a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"This jury heard a functional equivalent of a judicial, in-court confession. It 
was not misled by having religion put on trial. But it did hear a rather tragic 
story of a daughter's alienation from her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it was this last human -- but relevant -- portion of the case that had 
the jury considering jury nullification," Moon said, referring to the jury's 
dilemma of hearing hard evidence suggesting a technical violation of the law, 
but not wanting to apply the law against the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office agreed later that it had a hard case to try. 
</P>
<P>
"You've identified a very thorny issue, which some would argue is fatal to this 
kind of prosecution," Casey said. "This isn't a difficult case because of the 
facts. It isn't difficult because of the law. It's difficult because of the 
people. This is not a robbery case. It's a 'Father Knows Best' case. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a family of people we (prosecutors) have characterized as good and 
decent and nice people who felt themselves driven to a desperate act, out of 
love. Unfortunately," said Casey, "that act is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Casey said prosecutors aren't second-guessing their decision to pursue the 
case, despite Moon's remarks from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"They admitted forcibly taking an adult woman who was violating no law off the 
street and holding her against her will. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge observed in his comments that Earle Brown admitted virtually every 
allegation -- he copped out on the witness stand -- and still the jury didn't 
convict because of what the judge called the equities and we call sympathy. 
Perhaps from a legal standpoint that's disappointing and from a human 
standpoint it's heartening." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rempel, the prosecutor, said he found the judge's dismissal 
acceptable. "What we have are two people in the business of law who are 
disagreeing on the application of the law. It's a philosophical, not emotional, 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
Then, turning to Daniels, he said: "Congratulations. You're lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he was "deeply humbled" by Moon's ruling. "I'm so relieved I can 
barely stand up," Daniels said. "I'll be celebrating for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
One of the defense attorneys, Charles Duff, credited Moon for acting 
"courageously" but added, "He must have realized that public opinion was on our 
side. He finally became aware the people in this county didn't want this 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Another defense attorney, Herb Weston, said of the dismissal, "Not bad, for a 
defenseless case." 
</P>
<P>
Earle Brown's attorney, Saul Wright, said that, although he was delighted by 
the resolution, "I'm sorry it took us this long. This case should never have 
gotten this far." 
</P>
<P>
To a one, the five defense attorneys said they were astonished by Moon's 
decision, especially given the judge's rulings, which they said had 
consistently gone against their case -- including his fundamental ruling that 
the Browns could not be defended on the basis that they were motivated by a 
sense for Ginger Brown's welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was for us all the time," said Weston, "he sure didn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
Added attorney John Patterson, "For once, the judge was right." 
</P>
<P>
Among the options available to the court were to drop the charges against all 
but Daniels, who was considered by most jurors as the most likely to face a 
conviction because of his professional role in the snatching. 
</P>
<P>
Moon said Daniels "has successfully hidden behind the Brown family shield." But 
he said that, since the prosecution chose to include Daniels among the five 
co-defendants, it shouldn't have "a second chance" to prosecute him alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not condone any of Mr. Daniels' actions. In my view, they were outside 
the law," Moon said. But he then wondered aloud whether kidnaping laws can be 
applied to these sorts of cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be argued that the prosecution of these deprogramming kidnaping cases 
deter abductions (of relatives) and deter vigilantes. Perhaps our society will 
always struggle with this phenomenon," Moon said. But he suggested that new 
laws be written to specifically address the abduction of family members for 
deprogramming purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Altschul said Friday that "everybody is relieved that we can go on to do our 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"However, there's a great need, a great desire on Ginger's part, to have her 
family come over to our side and become good Christians, to shake hands and ask 
for an excuse. Mr. Brown should stop excluding Ginger as a daughter because she 
doesn't go to his church," Altschul said. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs not to be a member, but to look at the fact that we are a church, not 
a cult, and there will be no harm to learn more about us. It's time for him to 
do that. He needs to accept his daughter and what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown said she is looking to her father to apologize to her. "There was 
a definite wrongdoing against me," she said. "The next step would be for my dad 
to apologize to me, my church and especially my pastor. That would be a start." 
</P>
<P>
But Earle Brown said he was still "really concerned about Ginger and her 
well-being -- and for other parents with children in this situation." He said 
he stood ready to reconcile with his daughter, but was not ready to apologize 
for his actions. "I don't know what there is to apologize for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To that, Rempel remarked: "When the Browns get home, they'll realize they may 
have traded their daughter for a surrogate son (Daniels), and paid $20,000 to 
do it. Is that a bargain?" 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown's $2.5-million lawsuit against her parents and the others involved 
in the deprogramming attempt remains filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said the district attorney's office had not yet decided whether to appeal 
Moon's dismissals.

PILOT SAFELY LANDS SPUTTERING PLANE IN COLLEGE PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least two non-students were glad that school was out Friday afternoon at 
Palomar Community College in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
When their plane began losing power about 3 p.m., flight instructor Ron Corbin 
and student pilot Joan Hershfeld had little choice but to find a flat spot in 
which to land the 1946 Stinson Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had been flying in the Fallbrook area and were headed to Palomar 
Airport in Carlsbad when the single-engine craft threatened to become a 
no-engine craft. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Corbin spotted a welcome sight, a nearly deserted parking lot on 
the western side of the college. Corbin told witnesses that he had to hedge-hop 
one car in his path and avoid a couple of others to bring down the plane 
safely. Neighbors who saw the low-flying plane and heard its sputtering engine 
called the fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hell of a landing," San Marcos Fire Capt. Michael Marks said with 
admiration. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Corbin had landed anywhere but on an airport runway, 
but, "I have practiced the procedure many times," he said. Marks said the plane 
was in excellent shape after its unscheduled landing. There were no fuel leaks 
or serious damage to the fuselage. After an investigation, Federal Aviation 
Administration officials released the plane to its owner, Hershfeld's husband, 
John, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin, 28, of Ramona, runs a flight school at Palomar Airport and was taking 
Hershfeld, of Elfin Forest, on a training flight when the engine revved and a 
loud knocking began, Corbin said. 
</P>
<P>
"A rod broke and knocked a hole the size of a golf ball in the engine," he 
said. "All the oil spewed out. I knew we were seconds away before the engine 
seized up." 
</P>
<P>
Corbin headed for the emptiest and largest Palomar parking lot he could find. 
"It was pretty routine, although I did have to hop over one car," he said of 
the landing. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin said that the Hershfelds, both student pilots with about 10 hours of 
flying time each, will have the aircraft trucked back to Palomar Airport. 
Meantime, they plan to camp in their motor home in the parking lot to keep away 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
A switchboard operator at Palomar College said no officials were available for 
comment Friday because the school is "on a class break." That was a lucky break 
for the fliers, because the parking lots are usually "full to overflowing," she 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Glen Elementary School in Escondido has become the county's first to win 
a new computer system under a program sponsored by the Vons grocery company. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen received an Apple IIe Color System Friday after parents and friends 
of the school collected cash register tape receipts totaling $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
Any of the county's 490 schools can compete for six different Apple systems by 
collecting the receipts. A minimum of $65,000 is needed for the least expensive 
system. Orange Glen already has raised an additional $100,000 in receipts as 
part of its goal toward winning six systems before the program ends in mid-May.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legal representation of the county's abused and neglected children was 
officially transferred to the county counsel Friday from the district 
attorney's office, a county spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the county Board of Supervisors authorized the creation of a new 
county counsel unit, the Juvenile Dependency Division, to take over child-abuse 
and neglect cases from the overburdened district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney aides had complained that they did not have adequate time to 
prepare for the increasing number of juvenile dependency cases. 
</P>
<P>
The Juvenile Dependency Division will employ 15 lawyers -- nearly double the 
district attorney's staff handling these cases -- to handle the court-ordered 
removal of 7,850 abused or neglected children, according to Chief Deputy County 
Counsel Philip Dunn, who heads the new division. 
</P>
<P>
Seven additional staff attorneys will handle 400 custody cases and 70 appeal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office will continue to handle criminal prosecution of 
child abusers.

<P>
A San Diego defense consultant was sentenced to a year in prison Friday for his 
role in a scheme to funnel bribes to a Marine Corps procurement official. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Illeman was also fined $10,000 by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton 
in Virginia on his guilty plea to bribing a public official. 
</P>
<P>
Illeman, who is cooperating with the investigation of Pentagon procurement 
fraud dubbed "Operation Ill Wind," admitted sharing money he received from 
Whittaker Command &amp; Control Systems with Jack Sherman, the civilian Marine 
Corps official. 
</P>
<P>
Illeman said he sent Sherman $5,000 in cash in the spring of 1988. Sherman, who 
has also pleaded guilty, said he took $8,000 from Illeman. 
</P>
<P>
Illeman could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000.

BOY PLEADS GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER IN MOORPARK SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Moorpark youth, whose hometown rallied to his defense when he was charged 
with murdering a local eccentric, has pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
voluntary manslaughter under an agreement that will allow him to avoid an adult 
prison, his attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
William (Billy) Cardiel, 17, entered the plea in Ventura Municipal Court on 
Thursday for the July 13 death of Chester Lawson, a part-time groundskeeper 
characterized by townspeople as "the Moorpark bum." Cardiel, who was originally 
charged with murder in Juvenile Court, contended that he acted in defense of a 
friend when he struck the 59-year-old Lawson with an 8-foot-long wooden pole. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiel could still be sentenced to a term in the California Youth Authority, 
but his attorney, Charles R. English of Santa Monica, said he would seek 
probation for the youth. "He wants to get out of jail, and then he needs to go 
back and get his high school degree. That's his first step," English said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson's death and the subsequent arrest of Cardiel and his friend Andy 
Amavisca stunned Moorpark, a rapidly growing former farming community of about 
25,000 residents. Neighbors established a legal defense fund on Cardiel's 
behalf, and a faithful corps of about 30 friends and relatives often missed 
school and work to attend court hearings and lend emotional support to his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The fund's organizers said Friday that $4,700 had been raised so far and that 
donations are still coming in. English declined to disclose the legal fees 
accrued by Cardiel, whose father works in construction and mother is employed 
by the Moorpark Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea was entered after the prosecution agreed not to seek a state 
prison term, said English and Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. 
Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said he has not decided what kind of sentence to recommend, but 
confinement to a California Youth Authority facility is still possible. 
Voluntary manslaughter carries a maximum term of 11 years. But under state law, 
Cardiel would have to be released from a youth correctional facility when he 
reaches 25, Ellison and English said. 
</P>
<P>
English also acknowledged Friday that unresolved questions over the number of 
blows Cardiel struck -- at least six -- played a role in the decision to plead 
guilty rather than go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a substantial risk" that a jury might find that Cardiel was guilty 
of murder on the grounds that he used more force than needed to protect his 
friend, continuing to strike after Lawson had been beaten defenseless, English 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If death occurred from the first blow, the one necessary to protect Billy, 
then I'd think it would be a not-guilty" verdict, he said. "But if it was the 
fifth blow that killed him, then it could've been a whole different story." 
</P>
<P>
Cardiel, who is being held in the county's juvenile detention facility in 
Ventura, is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 28 by Superior Court Judge Lawrence 
Storch. His case was transferred out of Juvenile Court last month after Judge 
Barbara A. Lane found his actions heinous enough to warrant prosecution as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
English said Cardiel deserved to be placed on probation because he had no 
criminal record or history of violence, and because "this death was a 
situational kind of thing that has no likelihood of repeating." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson did odd jobs for Moorpark shopkeepers, who said he was prone to drunken, 
obscene and sometimes violent outbursts. He was killed during a confrontation 
with Cardiel and Amavisca near the small trailer where he lived. Amavisca was 
never charged in the death. 
</P>
<P>
The two teen-agers had been drinking beer and talking in Amavisca's truck, 
which was parked in a vacant lot Lawson was paid $40 a week to keep free of 
litter and intruders. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing to determine whether he should be tried as an adult instead of 
a juvenile, Cardiel testified that Lawson came at Amavisca with a pitchfork and 
that he feared for his best friend's life. Lawson was drunk, Cardiel recalled 
during emotional testimony, and called the youths obscene names and racial 
epithets. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiel said he grabbed a nearby wooden pole and sneaked up on Lawson from 
behind before striking him on the head at least three times. A coroner later 
testified that Lawson received at least six blows, maybe more, the majority 
delivered after he was lying on the ground, and that he suffered broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
One of Lawson's few friends in Moorpark, a manager for the company whose 
property Lawson helped guard, said Friday that Cardiel deserved "a little hard 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a vindictive person," said Ken Purdy, a manager for the Air Dry Corp. 
"But I feel our youths today just are not responsible for their actions, and I 
think this is a case where this young gentleman has to be made aware of what 
he's done."

PLEA BARGAIN OFFERED TO PARENTS ACCUSED IN BEATING AT COMMUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has offered a plea bargain to resolve criminal 
charges against a couple accused in the beating of their 11-year-old son at the 
Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation's commune in Saugus, an attorney in the case 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment for Marc Stuart Landgarten, 40, and Carol Ann Miller Landgarten, 
37, had been set for Thursday in Antelope Municipal Court. But the hearing was 
continued to Feb. 14 so the couple could consider the offer, said Charles A. 
Klum, a public defender representing Carol Landgarten. 
</P>
<P>
The Landgartens, who remain free on $25,000 bail each, were originally charged 
in an October, 1988, complaint that included felony child abuse charges against 
Tony Alamo and three other church members stemming from the incident. Alamo and 
the three others remain fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's going to be up to them to decide" if the couple wants to accept 
the plea bargain and avoid trial, Klum said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney added that he could not discuss the proposed terms because he had 
yet to present them to his client. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office confirmed that plea-bargain discussions are 
occurring in the case against members of the anti-Catholic sect but declined to 
elaborate. "There have been some negotiations, but I don't know what the status 
of those are," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven D. Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
Klum, head public defender in Lancaster, said prosecutors acknowledge that the 
mother was not an active participant in the January, 1988, incident on Alamo 
foundation property. Her son allegedly was struck about 140 times on the 
buttocks with a three-foot paddle. 
</P>
<P>
The stepfather held the boy down but did not spank him, Klum said. 
</P>
<P>
The stepfather is represented by attorney Robert M. Talcott, who could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Klum said he expects the Landgartens will respond to the district attorney's 
offer before their return to court. 
</P>
<P>
The public defender said he had yet to decide whether to recommend the offer. 
</P>
<P>
He added that it does not involve the couple providing information about other 
sect members.

PRESIDIO PROVIDES A PEEK BACK IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from the trash, early Spanish officers at the Presidio overlooking 
Mission Valley preferred Chinese pottery with blue willow designs. But, when 
Mexico took over in the 1820s, brightly painted Mexican dishes were the pottery 
of choice. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage left behind by 18th-Century Spanish officers stationed at the 
Presidio, the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, is giving 
archeologists a continuing look at preferences of the Europeans who lived at 
what was both a fort and an administrative center when it was founded in 1769 
by Spaniards led by Father Junipero Serra. 
</P>
<P>
"The Presidio was the frontier fort of the Spanish colonial exercise," Brad 
Bartel, professor of anthropology at San Diego State University, told an 
audience during a recent slide presentation at the Museum of Man in Balboa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
What distinguishes the San Diego fort in Presidio Park from ones established at 
Santa Barbara, Monterey and San Francisco, is that it is the only one that was 
extensively preserved and available for excavation. The one in San Francisco 
was destroyed by the Army in the 1850s, and the other two are beneath modern 
structures, Bartel said. 
</P>
<P>
Since fall, 1987, about 50,000 artifacts have been excavated from the northern 
side of the fort by Bartel and SDSU students. Most of the artifacts came from 
what was a trash dump next to the four rooms that have thus far been excavated. 
That trash, Bartel said, has revealed pieces of Chinese pottery with blue 
willow motifs from the 1770s and British imitations of the Chinese pottery from 
the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Bartel said they have found pieces of bowls, plates and teacups in different 
floral patterns made by the British. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish preferred British or Chinese pottery," Bartel said. "They were 
users of other societies' pottery. 
</P>
<P>
"They took a little slice of life from Europe with them," he said. "Frontier 
duty for a soldier is not easy. Therefore, to be able to pick some aesthetic 
preferences made life a little bit easier." 
</P>
<P>
When control of the fort transferred from Spain to Mexico in the 1820s, the 
trash changed. Among the shards were fragments of brightly painted Mexican 
pottery, metal buttons, nails, beads, abalone and clamshells, and the bones of 
thousands of butchered animals. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the fort have already been excavated: a chapel on the southern 
side by a San Diego State crew, from 1965-1976, and the fort's western wing by 
a Mesa College crew, from 1976-1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Serra Museum, dedicated in 1929 on a hill above the Presidio, has artifacts 
from those excavations on display. The San Diego Mission was once situated at 
the Presidio but was moved in 1774 to its present location in Mission Valley, 
about 6 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
The fort was abandoned in the 1830s when the inhabitants moved down the hill 
into what is now Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
The fort was buried in the 1930s, when George White Marston acquired the land 
and gave it to the city to be used as a public park. 
</P>
<P>
"He understood the significance of the site and wanted to preserve it," Bartel 
said.

17-YEAR-OLD STABBED IN BURBANK GANG DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Burbank boy was in extremely critical condition Friday after he 
was stabbed several times during a gang dispute, Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was not released, was found collapsed in the street in the 
1600 block of Edison Road at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to remove 
one lung and was in the intensive care unit Friday, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators that the teen-ager had been stabbed during a 
street fight and staggered about a block before collapsing, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely a gang-related stabbing," Goldberg said. "It appears the 
young man got into a verbal altercation with several members from an opposing 
gang and then was stabbed several times in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said detectives had no suspects, and the identity of the assailants' 
gang was not known.

HASTILY ADOPTED RESTRICTIONS ON HILLSIDE BUILDING MAY UNITE OPPONENTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SIERRA MADRE OFFICIALS, PROPERTY OWNERS AND PRESERVATIONISTS AGREE 
THAT THE STRICT GUIDELINES SHOULD BE MODIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a swift chain of events that unfolded like a drama, the Sierra Madre City 
Council has adopted an ordinance that imposes what may be the strictest 
guidelines on hillside development among foothill cities in the San Gabriel 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and both sides agree that the guidelines probably will be 
modified. 
</P>
<P>
The rush of events included an end-of-year revelation by an attorney of a City 
Hall error that allowed the unexpected expiration of a building moratorium and 
resulted in civic chagrin, a hastily called special council meeting and the 
failure recently of hillside property owners to agree to a self-imposed 
building moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance adopted unanimously by the council was originally drafted by the 
city's Planning Commission. It imposes requirements ranging from five to 40 
acres per house by dividing the hills into five zones stretching vertically up 
the mountainsides. Buildings are limited to one story and a maximum height of 
20 feet. The previous foothill density guidelines were much less strict -- one 
house per 15,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
After the council meeting, property owners and preservationists, who had 
clashed since September in overflow meetings at City Hall, smiled uncomfortably 
at each other with the realization that now they will have to work together if 
they want to amend the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was the most wonderful thing that happened," said preservationist 
Gurden Miller. "The ordinance that nobody really likes and that has to be 
amended will bring people together." 
</P>
<P>
When first proposed in September, the ordinance pleased many of Sierra Madre's 
10,800 residents. But it enraged some of the about 15 hillside property owners. 
They and their attorneys accused the city of, in effect, confiscating their 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council then proposed modifications that, in turn, outraged the town's 
informal preservationist group, the Hillside Coalition. Coalition members said 
the revisions weakened the ordinance, and they threatened to withdraw their 
support of three council members who proposed the changes and who are up for 
reelection in April. 
</P>
<P>
The council's version was referred back to the Planning Commission last fall 
for further study. Then came the sudden turn of events that ended the stalemate 
and punched the solution of the controversy into fast-forward. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst was land-use attorney Mark Steres, who represents hillside 
property owners Annette and Lawson Martin. When preservationists discovered in 
1988 that the Martins had purchased 100 acres in the foothills of Monrovia, 
Arcadia and Sierra Madre, they realized the foothills could be developed. 
</P>
<P>
At their urging, the council passed a hillside building moratorium. Multiple 
extensions were approved while the city tussled with an ordinance to govern 
hillside development. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of December, Sierra Madre officials thought that moratorium 
extensions were still in effect. Steres' research showed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought the moratorium was expiring in March of 1990," Steres said. "But 
according to my analysis, it expired September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic move at 4:50 p.m. on Dec. 29 -- the last day of business for the 
city in 1989 -- Steres delivered to City Hall a request to subdivide 11.3 acres 
of the Martins' land into 10 lots. He sent a cover letter that said the request 
had to be honored because the city had no moratorium in effect. 
</P>
<P>
After City Atty. Charles Martin (no relation to Annette and Lawson Martin) 
confirmed that Steres was correct, those involved went into a frenzy of action. 
Phones began ringing all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an absolute shock to the Hillside Coalition," coalition member Caroline 
Brown said. "We were under the impression that all the procedural matters had 
been handled correctly by the city administration . . . but basically they 
goofed. We thought we were left without hillside protection." 
</P>
<P>
A special meeting of the Sierra Madre Council was called for 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 
4, a Thursday. The council usually meets on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. Because many 
residents were still away on holiday vacations, only about 25 people attended 
the meeting -- considerably fewer than had attended previous meetings about the 
hillside development ordinance. As many as 200 people attended some of those 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Martin advised the council to adopt the Planning Commission 
ordinance as a stopgap measure because no further building moratorium 
extensions could legally be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Following assurances that it will amend the ordinance, the council then 
reluctantly introduced the strict version of the hillside ordinance. Shocked 
property owners left the meeting saying they were resolved to impose a 
voluntary building moratorium on themselves that would make unnecessary the 
city's passage of the strict building restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But by the regularly scheduled council meeting the next Tuesday, the property 
owners had not reached an agreement. Without discussion, the council then 
unanimously adopted the strict measure, which took effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it as a knee-jerk reaction to protect themselves," Steres said after 
the vote. "This story isn't close to being finished." 
</P>
<P>
Steres said he believes that the new ordinance won't affect the Martins' 
subdivision request, which was submitted before the measure was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the ordinance will be worked out in voluntary meetings now being 
planned by members of the Hillside Coalition and hillside property owners such 
as the Passionist Fathers, who operate a 65-acre religious retreat, and Mike 
Heflin and David Willis, whose families each own 100 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Likely to be considered are the modifications proposed earlier by the council, 
which reduced the acreage requirements and created three horizontal zones. 
Coalition members also said they are researching a hillside development 
ordinance in Rancho Cucamonga that restricts development on all slopes of 15% 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Sierra Madre hills are protected, Brown said. But she was 
reluctant to say that the rapid turn of events meant a victory for 
preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think we have an upper hand," she said, smiling, "but I don't think it's 
useful to be too proud or too right."

LOOK UNDERFOOT -- THAT'S CIVIC PRIDE YOU'RE STEPPING ON IN OCEAN BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The names along the Walk of Fame in Ocean Beach are -- well, let's face it -- 
far more pedestrian than on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but the small, 
personalized tiles lining Newport Avenue sidewalks have residents clamoring for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have laid more than 2,000 of the ocean-blue tiles -- each inscribed 
with a message from a community resident -- from Sunset Cliffs Boulevard to the 
foot of Newport Avenue, said Linda Small, president of the Ocean Beach 
Merchants Assn., which sponsored the tile project. 
</P>
<P>
Sayings engraved for posterity range from "Lynette Rice slipped here" to "Keep 
off my tiles." One is inscribed with a personal plea -- "Ann, will you marry 
me? Brad." Another pleads for people to "Work for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
The tiles were sold for $35 each last year and came with a certificate that 
reads, "You are the proud owner of an Ocean Beach tile," Small said. 
</P>
<P>
The tiles were planned to coincide with the community's revitalization program. 
As cracked sidewalks were replaced, and street lamps and planter boxes 
installed, the tiles went in. Money left over from the installation will go 
toward other community projects, such as a new community bulletin board, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ocean Beach is a very close-knit community. Everybody knows everybody," Small 
said. "We thought a lot of people would want to be a part of Ocean Beach 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 2,000 tiles were sold, but the association's tile 
committee could easily have sold 400 more once people saw what they looked 
like, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Andrews, tile number 2021, was among those who got in under the wire. A 
former paper boy, Andrews commissioned his tile to read, "I sold newspapers 
here in 1937." 
</P>
<P>
When he was 15 years old, he sold copies of the old San Diego Sun newspaper for 
3 cents in front of what is now Newport Farms Market, Andrews said. His stack 
of papers was dropped off by streetcar in front of what was then the Piggly 
Wiggly market, and he sold the papers for a half-cent profit. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to make the Navy his career and served in three wars, he said, but 
Andrews never forgot his experiences on the corner of Newport Avenue and Bacon 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Ocean Beach all my life," Andrews said. "The tile will be there 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
The Merchant's Assn. is going to close the street and hold "a huge tile party 
in late March so people can look at the tiles uninterrupted by parked cars and 
traffic," Small said. It will be a good opportunity for people to lie on their 
tiles, if they want to, and get their pictures taken with their families, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But a lot of residents are not waiting until the tile party. "We see people who 
are already strolling up and down the street looking at the tiles," Small said. 
</P>
<P>
"We bought a tile for Marvin, my father-in-law, for his birthday," said Pam 
Lloyd, who was slowly walking down the street with her 6-month-old son, looking 
for familiar names. 
</P>
<P>
"He was born and raised here. He's an O. Beachian from the word go. It was a 
great present for a man who has everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I had bought a square for my son." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd is not the only one who wishes they had bought a tile. People have 
besieged workers laying the tiles and left the association in a quandary over 
how to respond to the demand, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 5,000 tiles laid, more than 2,000 were personalized, but they had to be 
bulk ordered and delivered in 700-pound crates from Seattle. The company cannot 
do them in small quantities, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Knox, an association member, discovered the tiles on a visit to an 
outdoor Seattle market with personalized tiles while on vacation there, Small 
said. The association decided to use the same Seattle manufacturer to make the 
tiles because "we couldn't find anyone locally to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But now the group is trying to find a contractor who will engrave the remaining 
blank tiles, she said.

FIRES PROMPT PLEA TO USE, TEST SMOKE DETECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two children playing with matches started unrelated fires this week -- one of 
which caused the death of a 4-year-old girl -- prompting the San Diego Fire 
Department to issue a plea urging parents to teach children about fire safety 
and to install and test smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents should be aware of matches or lighters they have in the house, and 
should put them up where their children can't get to them," firefighter 
Jennifer Simpson said. "Parents should also teach children what a fire can do." 
Simpson said the department is working on a fire-safety program for preschool 
students. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old boy was playing with matches when a fire started in a bedroom on 
the ground floor of a two-story apartment complex at 4115 Altadena Ave., 
according to Fire Capt. Allan MacDonald. The child was in the living room with 
his father watching television when the father saw smoke coming from the 
bedroom shortly before 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The boy apparently had slipped away unnoticed and started the fire. No one was 
injured in the blaze, which caused $20,000 worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, 4-year-old Nunce Enriques died in an apartment fire at 1541 S. 
38th St. She was playing with matches when the fire started about 5 p.m. in a 
second-floor unit of a two-story apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Four other people, including the girl's 17-year-old uncle, who was 
baby-sitting, escaped without injury, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
The four who escaped were in a back bedroom with the door closed while the 
victim played by herself in the living room. When they smelled smoke, they 
opened the door to find the living room engulfed in flames. They jumped to 
safety through the bedroom window. Damage to the building was estimated at 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said fire inspectors will issue notices of violation to the apartment 
owners, requiring them to immediately install smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Uniform Fire Code requires detectors to be installed near sleeping areas in 
each multi-unit apartment building, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments on Altadena and South 38th did not have smoke detectors, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said the fires occurred in the midst of state-designated "Smoke 
Detector Month." The California fire marshal has initiated a billboard campaign 
titled "Is Your Smoke Detector Working?" and "Smoke Detectors Save Lives." 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of homes have smoke detectors, but only 50% are working, MacDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty percent of the smoke detectors installed in homes are not working 
because of lack of maintenance, lack of batteries or because they are 
improperly installed or in a poor location," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged residents to obtain detectors and test them monthly. "It takes only a 
minute to push the test button once a month. It's a life-saving feature. 
</P>
<P>
"For $10 or $20, you can buy the cheapest form of life insurance," MacDonald 
said. "But it is only effective if it is working. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real good chance that if there had been a working smoke detector in 
the (38th Street) apartment, the child probably would still be alive," he said.

<P>
All you media experts who chastised the Rams for the Eric Dickerson trade were 
right on when you convinced us what a horrible deal it was. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams, without Dickerson the whiner, are in the playoffs. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Colts, with Dickerson, are watching on the tube like the rest of us. 
Again. And Eric is whining true to form once again. Football ain't so much fun 
when you never get past the regular season, huh guy? 
</P>
<P>
 -- With the exception of Gaston Green, everyone involved in the deal has 
greatly contributed to the Rams' continued success and should play a big part 
in their program for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
It was a horrible deal all right. Just ask Indianapolis.

BRONKO NAGURSKI A REAL ALL-TIMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allan Malamud's column of Jan. 10 includes comments to the effect that the 
legendary Bronko Nagurski could not play defensive tackle today. Bronko played 
60 years ago and his talent has stood the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Sporting News selected an all-time college football team and 
Bronko was a first-team defensive tackle along with fellow Golden Gopher Leo 
Nomellini. George Halas said he was the greatest football player who ever 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
If he were in his youth today, he undoubtedly would be into weight training and 
would be the all-pro nose tackle. He could have been another Dick Butkus as an 
inside linebacker as well as an all-pro at tight end. I saw Bronko wrestle many 
times when I was a boy out in Minnesota. He was pushing 40, but had great 
agility even then.

Anyone lucky enough to watch Bronko Nagurski play football got their money's 
worth. He played hard and clean for 60 minutes against top and tough 
competition that gave no quarter. Comparisons are academic, but should there be 
a Super Bowl in heaven, Nagurski will be the starting fullback.

HOMER'S HOMECOMING IS WELL RECEIVED

A visitor to the offices of the New York football Giants in the late 1950s 
noted that in one room, defensive coach Tom Landry could be seen lecturing his 
men; in a second, offensive coach Vince Lombardi was leading his troops, while 
in another room head Coach Jim Lee Howell was reading a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
With the rehiring of Homer Smith, UCLA has the chance to implement the Howell 
system for Terry Donahue -- the best recruiter and worst coach in America.

in Chile to check procedures in the harvesting, packing and transport of fruits 
being exported to the United States.

spokesman said. "If all goes as planned, this will be the biggest repatriation 
of refugees in Central American history," said Carlos Mondonado of the of 
Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. About 1,500 Salvadorans at a 
U.N.-run camp in Colomoncagua, two miles from the Salvadoran border, are due to 
go home Sunday, he said.

Palestinians on the West Bank set fire to a bus taking Arab workers to their 
jobs in Israel only hours after the army sealed the homes of four men accused 
of similar attacks. Residents and military sources said masked activists 
ordered the workers and the Israeli Arab driver off the bus in Nablus before 
burning it. About 30 masked Palestinians from the Islamic fundamentalist 
movement Hamas paraded through the Nablus casbah in what residents described as 
an unusual show of strength.

"It's a weight off my head," she told reporters outside a courtroom after the

was found in her handbag in a police raid last April 8 on a suburban Kingston 
mansion. She pleaded innocent. Jones had testified last month that she believed

A Carmel Valley man was sentenced to 48 years in prison for kidnaping an 
18-year-old Morgan Hill woman, chaining her up and repeatedly raping her while 
holding her hostage for a week. Burton Bathke, 41, was sentenced this week by 
Monterey County Superior Court Judge Richard Silver. 
</P>
<P>
A jury had convicted him of 18 felony counts, including kidnaping, rape and 
false imprisonment. Bathke claimed that his victim lied about her time with him 
from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, 1988. He said she was left alone at times when she 
could have escaped, that she went dining with him at restaurants, went shopping 
and did household chores, including feeding his cat. Bathke released her with a 
promise of clothes, money and a car if she didn't tell anyone. She went 
straight to the police.

<P>
Civil rights abuse charges were dismissed Friday against one of six San 
Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies accused of brutality in the alleged 
beatings of five Mexican nationals in 1988. U.S. District Judge A. Wallace 
Tashima removed Deputy Michael Stout at the request of the lawyer for the 
deputies. Attorney Stephen Yagman, who represents the five plaintiffs, said the 
civil rights allegations against Stout were dismissed because the officer 
played only a minor role in the alleged beatings on June 30, 1988, in 
Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
"He got to the scene late," Yagman said. "He was also the nicest one on the 
(witness) stand." The alleged beatings occurred when deputies arrived to 
investigate a complaint about a loud, all-night party. A neighbor's videotape 
of the arrests, showing the alleged beatings, has become the trial's 
centerpiece.

Oakland authorities, led by Mayor Lionel Wilson, met for two hours with Los 
Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis on Friday to discuss that city's bid for the 
football team to return to its former home in Oakland. Afterward, Davis called 
it "a good meeting" but gave no indication when he might decide between 
competing bids from Oakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles -- all vying to be the 
future home for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"The most crucial thing for me is the future and the greatness of the Raiders," 
Davis said. "I'm going to do what is best for the team." Wilson said Oakland 
expected to hear something in two weeks, but such optimism has been standard 
among officials meeting with Davis in a bidding process that has been going on 
for 2 1/2 years.

CULT LEADER ADMITTED KILLING OHIO FAMILY, AGENT TELLS COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of a religious cult admitted to his followers that he killed five 
members of an Ohio family and had members of his group help bury the victims, 
according to a court affidavit. Self-proclaimed prophet Jeffery Lundgren, 39; 
his wife, Alice Elizabeth, 38; their eldest son, Damon, 19, and 10 others have 
been charged in the shooting deaths of Dennis Avery, 49; his wife Cheryl, 42, 
and their daughters, Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 6. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the defendants admitted seeing Lundgren shoot a member of the 
Avery family, and other followers said Lundgren "had an affinity" for the Colt 
.45, believed to be the murder weapon, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent said in the affidavit. The Averys were allegedly killed 
execution-style on a Kirtland farm last April. In a search warrant affidavit, 
filed Sunday in El Cajon Municipal Court, ATF Agent Richard Van Haelst of the 
bureau's Kansas City office said he interviewed cult members who gave him 
"detailed descriptions of the murders in question and Jeffrey Paul Lundgren's 
admissions to those homicides." One member interviewed said he saw Lundgren 
shoot one person and that "the one murder that he actually observed was 
committed with the particular handgun . . . the Colt .45," Van Haelst's 
affidavit said.

PRO BASKETBALL: THEY BEAT THE BUCKS, 95-94, FOR THEIR FIFTH VICTORY IN SEVEN 
AWAY GAMES.

No one on the Clippers' dream-come-true tour has blinked to wake themselves, 
and Friday night, when the setting was right, no one flinched, either. 
</P>
<P>
Down to the last seconds in a one-point game, the Clippers hung on to beat the 
Milwaukee Bucks, 95-94, before 17,901 at the Bradley Center when Paul Pressey's 
shot for the Bucks rimmed out at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who have won three consecutive road games for the first time 
since March 28-April 1, 1986, are 5-2 on the trip. The final game will be 
played tonight at Chicago with the Clippers at 15-18, 2 1/2 months ahead of 
last season's 21-victory pace. 
</P>
<P>
About the time exhaustion is supposed to set in, the Clippers have opted 
instead for success. Numbness, maybe that's what all this winning brings. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper played 46 of a possible 48 minutes, including the entire second 
half. This after going 43, 39, 44 and 43 the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
"Wins help me prepare for these games," he said. "Believe me, if we were 
losing, I'd probably be real tired." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Don Casey: "These guys won't let themselves be tired." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith suffered reinjury of the right big toe that caused him to miss 
the Dec. 12 game at Portland. He played 36 minutes, the pain neutralized by the 
possibility of another victory. 
</P>
<P>
"No question," Smith said. "This makes it seem like all in a day's work. 
Injuries hurt more when you're losing." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, winners of six of their last nine since the most recent Sports 
Arena home stand, are feeling no pain. But they came so close to agony. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks (19-15), who lost to the Clippers in Milwaukee for the first time 
since Jan. 9, 1980, went on an 8-4 run that cut the Clipper lead to 93-92. When 
Harper made two free throws with 1:10 left, it was 95-92, and Pressey's shot 
from the right baseline made it a one-point margin again. 
</P>
<P>
The Pressey basket came with 25.1 seconds to play, meaning the Clippers could 
nearly run out the clock without even taking a shot. But they used less than 
six seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Harper walked the ball up court, backing across mid-court to protect the ball 
from Pressey. Harper hit the gas once too often and bumped into the Buck 
reserve, who seemed to have a role in every crucial play, and was called for an 
offensive foul at the 10-second line with 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was going to cost us the ballgame," said Harper, who had 23 
points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have lost close games with far less time before, so this seemed 
like forever. Milwaukee had two timeouts left but didn't use either. Ideally, 
the Bucks would have gotten the ball to Jack Sikma, a center who made only 
three of 14 attempts but shoots well outside for a big man, or Ricky Pierce, 
who was having a 25-point night. 
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to calling a timeout and letting them (the Clippers) set up a 
defense, we called for one of our bread-and-butter players and ran it," 
Milwaukee Coach Del Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we didn't get anybody open. At that point, we still had about eight 
seconds left, and that would have been a good time for us to take the timeout. 
But I wasn't able to get a timeout called, and we had to take the shot we could 
get off." 
</P>
<P>
To be certain, it wasn't what the Bucks were looking for -- an off-balance 
one-hander by Pressey at the free-throw line. It hit the rim and bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would score and we would come back and score," Casey said. 
"These guys are making me believers now." 
</P>
<P>
Casey may be in the minority among the Clippers in that regard. The players 
insist, as they have for days now as one impressive victory is followed by 
another, that they knew it could be like this. Kids say the darndest things. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we assumed," said Danny Manning, who returned to the site of his 
Jan. 4, 1989, knee injury and answered with 10 points in 35 minutes. "This is 
what we planned would happen." 
</P>
<P>
But what is it about Manning and Milwaukee? First the knee injury and then food 
poisoning. An order of take-out beef took care of him Thursday night, but he 
claimed to be close to full speed Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was another tremendous win for us," Casey said. "Partly because of the way 
they (the Bucks) had been playing and that we were on their court. It's just 
getting good day by day." 
</P>
<P>
Getting better is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee saw a four-game winning streak end. The Bucks had also won 24 in a 
row at home against Western Conference teams, a streak dating to Jan. 8, 1988. 
. . . Milwaukee Coach Del Harris: "There's no doubt they're a different team 
now with (Ron) Harper instead of Reggie Williams. Williams wasn't playing for 
them and he's not playing for Cleveland. So what they've done is transfer 20 
points from one city to another."

<P>
LAKERS: JOHNSON'S TRIPLE-DOUBLE PIVOTAL AGAINST ROCKETS, WHO ARE HANDICAPPED BY 
OLAJUWON'S FOUL TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
His enforced idleness on the bench finally over, Akeem Olajuwon rejoined Friday 
night's game with the Lakers leading his Houston Rockets by five points. The 
only problem was that only 5:17 remained and Olajuwon's next foul meant 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Under those rigid circumstances, not even a center as dominant as Olajuwon 
could overcome the deficit. At least, not on a night when Magic Johnson seemed 
intent on a victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, taking advantage of Olajuwon's foul trouble and letting Johnson 
handle matters upon Olajuwon's much-anticipated return, recorded a 107-98 
victory over Houston and improved their home record to 16-1 before 17,505 fans 
at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Although Olajuwon's absence for all but about 10 minutes in the second half 
clearly was the critical development, Johnson certainly made his presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker guard, overcoming a poor first half that plagued many of his 
teammates, finished with 31 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. It was his 
fifth triple-double of the season and the 117th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, in the words of Laker Coach Pat Riley, imposed his will upon the 
Rockets after scoring only one basket in the first quarter. Olajuwon, 
conversely, had six points and four blocked shots in the first quarter before 
he started hearing whistles directed toward him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocket center, who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds in 25 minutes, 
was called for his fourth foul after only 1:29 elapsed in the third quarter. 
Laker forward James Worthy, held to 10 points, was fouled by Olajuwon while 
attempting a shot in the lane, although Olajuwon said he thought the ball 
slipped from Worthy's grasp without contact. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Rocket Coach Don Chaney chose to stay with Olajuwon. Olajuwon 
had already sat out part of the second quarter with foul trouble, but to that 
point the Rockets maintained a six-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could get by leaving him in there," Chaney said. "It was just 
going to be for about a minute or so. I thought the call on that (fifth) foul 
was kind of chintzy." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, whose team improved its record to 25-8, defended Chaney's decision to 
keep Olajuwon in the game after the fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd do the same thing," Riley said. "I'd never second-guess. He had the 
(replacement) at the scorer's table. To me, really, the responsibility is for 
the player not to go out and get the foul in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Just over three minutes after Olajuwon's fourth foul, his fifth was assessed 
when he dipped his left shoulder into Mychal Thompson while attempting a 
baseline move. Chaney already had Larry Smith at the scorer's table when the 
foul was called. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't," Olajuwon said, asked if he had fouled Thompson. "But it doesn't 
matter now. It is too late. I was surprised by that call, especially when you 
already have four fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"He fouled me," Thompson said. "I have the dent in my chest to prove it. Akeem 
plays real hard on both ends. If a ref would really call them close, he'd be in 
foul trouble more often. But I guess they don't want to do that to superstars." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney, conversely, believes Olajuwon does not receive respect from officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see him get more respect from the refs," Chaney said. "Akeem has 
had some real cheap fouls called on him." 
</P>
<P>
Added Olajuwon: "Even at home, I don't get the calls, but I'm getting used to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, he left with 7:35 to play in the third quarter and did not return until 
5:17 remained in the game. And when Olajuwon went out, the Rockets' chances of 
breaking a regular-season Forum losing streak dating to 1985 went with him. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, not coincidentally, took their first lead of the second half 
immediately after Olajuwon's departure. With the Rockets shooting only 25% in 
the quarter, the Lakers built as much as a six-point lead before settling for a 
79-76 advantage going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, while Olajuwon fidgeted on the bench and Chaney went with the 6-foot-8 
Smith and little-known Adrian Caldwell, the Lakers built a lead that proved 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers scored six points in a row to begin the quarter, Orlando Woolridge 
starting the run by completing a dunk off a lob from Johnson after only 28 
seconds had elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney inserted Olajuwon with 5:17 left and the Lakers leading, 93-88. Johnson 
made it a seven-point advantage by scoring inside, then Olajuwon countered by 
scoring a basket on a goaltending call against Vlade Divac with 4:35 to play. 
</P>
<P>
That was the only basket Olajuwon scored, and the Lakers pulled away thanks to 
Johnson and a supporting cast that included Woolridge (17 points), Thompson (12 
points and 11 rebounds) and Divac (six points, eight rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson was the reason the Lakers persevered on a night when they struggled 
through a dismal first half. Johnson scored 22 of his 31 points in the second 
half, almost single-handedly wresting control from the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"The game changed when Earvin went into his 'Buck' attack," Riley said. "That's 
when he forgets about all that passing. He put his head down, got aggressive 
and challenged them. He imposed his will."

David Frost tied the second-lowest round in PGA Tour history Friday, and it 
could have been even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Frost one-putted 11 of his first 12 holes in the second round of the Tucson 
Open and finished with a 12-under-par 60 on a municipal course. Only a bogey on 
his 16th hole of the day prevented Frost from matching the record 59 Al 
Geiberger shot at the 1977 Memphis Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all disappointed," he said. "It's the first time I've ever been in 
this position, and it's three shots better than I've ever shot before . . . I'm 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
Frost one-putted 14 times and scored two eagles and nine birdies in only the 
eighth round of 60 ever recorded in tour competition. The last 60 was shot by 
Sam Snead in the 1957 Dallas Open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his spectacular round, Frost doesn't have sole possession of the lead. 
Jay Haas, who played in a threesome with Frost and Craig Stadler, shot a 64 to 
tie Frost's two-round total of 130. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know I was close," Haas said. "I was too caught up in watching 
David play." 
</P>
<P>
Stadler was eight strokes back at 138 after shooting a 69 on the 6,902-yard 
Randolph Park course, which usually plays to a par 70 but is listed at 72 for 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who won the World Series of Golf last season, hit a three-wood second 
shot to the green on the third hole (his 12th) and made a 30-foot putt for 
eagle-three. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started thinking about 59," he said. "I needed, what, three 
birdies in six holes? . . . And I made three birdies." 
</P>
<P>
But the bogey on the 356-yard, par-four seventh ruined any chance he had. 
</P>
<P>
Frost drove the fairway and had 107 yards to the pin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was between clubs, and I tried to hit a sand wedge hard," he said. "I didn't 
need to . . . It hit the green and bounced over." 
</P>
<P>
He chipped back to about six feet and missed the putt. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hit a bad shot. I'll have to think back on that," Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gamez, a 21-year-old rookie who passed up his last season at the 
University of Arizona to join the pro tour, shot a 64 at the TPC at Star Pass 
and was one shot back of the co-leaders at 131. 
</P>
<P>
The pros played one round on each of the two courses, and will play the final 
two at the more difficult Star Pass layout.

MORNING BRIEFING: OSKI'S MISBEHAVIOR DRAWS IRE IN BERKELEY

Oski the Bear, mascot of the University of California since 1941, hasn't been 
acting his age. 
</P>
<P>
Oski was suspended indefinitely after throwing a two-layer cream cake into the 
crowd during Sunday's game against Oregon State at Berkeley. Among those 
splattered was the family of Oregon State All-American candidate Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the Oski Committee, those who wear the bear's cardigan and 
full-face mask, William Manning, Cal's director of recreational sports, said: 
"Young people look to Oski as something almost mythical. It demands 
extraordinary behavior, and we're just not getting it."

Trivia time: Who holds the USC school record for longest punt? 
</P>
<P>
Lines cross: Richard Cole of Cleveland, co-owner of a company that sells 
sanitary napkins, wasn't amused by a headline that appeared in the San Diego 
County edition of The Times Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The headline on a column by Dave Distel, San Diego County sports editor, said: 
"Have a Credit Card Ready and Call Now! 1-800-BUY PADRES." The number for 
Cole's Emslee Products is 1-800-BUY PADS. Cole said: "Our phone has been 
ringing all day. My secretary can't get any work done, I'm losing orders, I'm 
paying 12 cents per minute for every call, what in the hell are you people 
doing out there?" 
</P>
<P>
What did Cole tell callers? "I told them, 'Listen, I can't sell you a baseball 
team, but if you need sanitary napkins, toilet-seat covers or diapers, I'm your 
man. I didn't make a single sale." 
</P>
<P>
Sizing them up: Terry Crisp, coach of the Calgary Flames, on the absence of 
Mark Hunter because of a knee injury: "We've got to get to the other team's net 
better and clear in front of our net better. Look at Philadelphia. Jeff 
Chychrun and Jay Wells are 8-foot-4. And Kjell Samuelsson's got to be 11 feet 
high. And here's poor little Theo Fleury chinning hmself on their kneecaps to 
score."

SUPERSONICS' ELLIS HURT IN CRASH; DWI ALLEGED

Dale Ellis of the Seattle SuperSonics suffered three broken ribs and a 
collapsed lung when his car hit a highway barrier Friday. He was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, 29, an all-star guard, was in satisfactory condition at Harborview 
Medical Center, according to spokeswoman Pam Round. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities gave this account of the accident: Ellis' 1989 Mercedes-Benz struck 
a barrier in a "Y" that splits the road into express and local traffic lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The car then careened across a lane and struck a movable arm that controls 
access to the express lanes. The passenger side of the black, two-door sedan 
was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was not taken into police custody after the 2 a.m. accident but was 
transported directly to Harborview. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was offered a blood-alcohol test at Harborview, but Washington State 
Police declined to say whether Ellis took the test. 
</P>
<P>
"My only concern and thoughts are that Dale Ellis recovers," said Bernie 
Bickerstaff, SuperSonic coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball becomes secondary in this situation. We were down there last night 
with him . . . for most of the night. He'll do all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt said Ellis was expected to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, the team's leading scorer this season, had 29 points Thursday in the 
SuperSonics' 98-87 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at the Seattle Coliseum. 
He was averaging 23 points, 15th best in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Police records show Ellis has been cited for moving violations nine times in 
King County during the past three years. Those citations include five for 
speeding, a driving history that county Deputy Prosecutor Mark Larson said 
might worsen Ellis' penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
For first-time offenders in Washington, driving while intoxicated carries a 
maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The mandatory minimum 
sentence is one day in jail, $250 in fines, $150 in court costs and revocation 
of driving privileges for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' case is not expected to come up in court for at least two months, Larson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ellis crashed a BMW into an interstate divider and abandoned the car. 
The car was a loaner from an auto-repair company that was working on his 
Jaguar. Ellis reportedly blamed the accident on the BMW's steering.

SPURS ARE SAD SIGHT FOR BIRD, CELTICS, 97-90 
</P>

<P>
Since he arrived in the NBA, Larry Bird has seldom seen the San Antonio Spurs 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Bird could only watch Friday night at Boston as the Spurs ended a string of 20 
losses against the Celtics with a 97-90 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth game Bird missed because of a sprained ankle. In the previous 
game Wednesday night, the Celtics overcame the absence of their star and beat 
the NBA champion Detroit Pistons, 104-97. 
</P>
<P>
But they couldn't handle the new-look Spurs. Rookie David Robinson and newcomer 
Terry Cummings took charge as the Spurs improved to 23-8, despite scoring only 
nine points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The poor quarter enabled the Celtics, trailing by 13 at halftime, to pull 
within one point early in the fourth quarter. But the Spurs, who had seven 
fewer field goals, went on a 10-2 run, making six of the 10 free throws, to 
pull away. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings had 10 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Robinson had 18 points 
and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Spurs beat the Celtics was Jan. 5, 1980, Bird's rookie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a big win for us," San Antonio Coach Larry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
New York 101, Indiana 96 -- Patrick Ewing had an off night, scoring only 20 
points in 47 minutes at Indianapolis, but he scored the basket in overtime that 
put the Knicks ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, who missed a short hook shortly before the buzzer that sent the game 
into overtime, was six for 15 from the field before making a jump shot early in 
the overtime that made the score 91-89. The Knicks, 4-0 in overtime games, shot 
only 44.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Detlef Schrempf, who was 10 for 14, the Pacers shot more poorly. The 
Pacers' Reggie Miller, who had 44 points in his previous game, made six of21. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing limited Rik Smits, the Pacers' 7-foot-4 center, to seven-of-21 shooting 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 107, Charlotte 95 -- If the bruised knee suffered by Michael Jordan was 
bothering him, it wasn't evident to the Hornets or 23,901 fans at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's injury had hampered his shooting and was a major reason the Bulls lost 
three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan made 19 of 28 shots and scored 45 points to end the Bulls' skid. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam had 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 97, Minnesota 86 -- Isiah Thomas scored eight of his 23 points during 
an 18-5 run at Auburn Hills, Mich., to lead the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Campbell, who led the Timberwolves with 28 points, made a jump shot to tie 
the score, 64-64, with 3:52 left in the third quarter. But Thomas took charge 
and the Pistons pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 113, Philadelphia 102 -- Mark Price scored 15 of his 30 points in the 
third period at Philadelphia as the Cavaliers won only their fifth road game in 
their last 15 outings. 
</P>
<P>
After the 76ers rallied from a 13-point deficit to trail by five with 8:28 
left, Price made a three-point play to take the Cavaliers out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 111, Sacramento 96 -- Kevin Johnson scored 14 points in the first 
quarter at Phoenix -- nine in the last 2:35 -- to get the Suns off to a 32-19 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have lost eight in a row on the road and 15 of their last 17 overall. 
It was the fifth consecutive victory at home for the Suns. DAN HAFNER

NETS' BRUNDY FIRST ROOKIE TO FAIL RANDOM DRUG TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Brundy, a rookie forward with the New Jersey Nets, was suspended for 
the rest of the season Friday night after failing a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
Brundy, who played at Crenshaw High and DePaul, is the first rookie to be 
suspended since the NBA began random drug testing of first-year players during 
training camp in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing the suspension, the NBA said that if Brundy follows 
the league's treatment procedure, he could be eligible to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very surprised and disappointed," said Harry Weltman, the Nets' senior 
vice president and general manager. "We will do our best to support him and, of 
course, we support the league's anti-drug policy and will abide by it." 
</P>
<P>
Weltman said he knew nothing about the test other than that Brundy tested 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, who were idle Friday night, play the Cleveland Cavaliers Saturday in 
Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Net Coach Bill Fitch said Brundy traveled to Ohio with the team but has 
returned to New Jersey. He had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big shock to me," Net forward Roy Hinson said. "I didn't expect 
anything like this to happen. He was on the plane with us and I saw him in the 
lobby after we came in." 
</P>
<P>
Brundy has played in 16 of the Nets' 34 games, averaging 2.3 points and 1.6 
rebounds. He scored a season-high 12 points on six-for-six shooting against the 
New York Knicks in New Jersey's fourth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Three random regular-season tests of rookies were approved in November as an 
amendment to the NBA's anti-drug agreement. In 1988, one test during training 
camp was authorized for rookies. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA said drug counselors will determine whether Brundy has complied with 
after-care requirements. If so, he could play again in 1990-91.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LEMIEUX STAYS HOT AGAINST COLD CAPITALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Lemieux had a goal and an assist Friday night at Landover, Md., to extend 
his scoring streak to 33 games and lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 6-4 
victory over the slumping Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh loss in a row for the Capitals, who were leading the Patrick 
Division on Dec. 29 and are now tied for last place. 
</P>
<P>
Only one player in NHL history has exceeded Lemieux's streak, and he did it 
twice. Wayne Gretzky had a 51-game streak during the 1983-84 season and one of 
39 games two seasons later. 
</P>
<P>
"The streak," Lemieux said, "is important only if we win. There's no 
satisfaction extending it in games in which we lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that we are finally starting to play the way we should. We're 
lucky to be in a division where nobody has taken charge." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh defenseman Paul Coffey reached a milestone. He scored his 270th 
goal, tying Bobby Orr for second place in goals by defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey is only 28. Barring injury, he seems certain to surpass the record of 
310 by Denis Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux has 25 points in the last eight games, during which the Penguins are 
6-2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The surge of the Penguins, who are only three points out of first place in the 
Patrick Division, began when Craig Patrick took over as coach and general 
manager Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, New Jersey 2 -- Stephane Richer scored twice and set up another to 
help the Canadiens end a five-game winless string (0-4-1) on the road. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third win in the last nine games for the Canadiens, who are 
trying to battle back from injuries and a lack of scoring punch. 
</P>
<P>
The three victories have come in the last four games and Richer is a major 
reason why. He has four goals and three assists in the three victories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to Stephane to lead us out of our rut," Coach Pat Burns said. "The way 
he looked tonight he's ready to do just that." 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 7, Detroit 5 -- Paul MacDermid had a goal and two assists at Winnipeg 
to lead the Jets to their seventh victory in the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets (21-17-5) moved ahead of the Kings and into third place in the Smythe 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carson had two goals and an assist for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
The game was marred by a lengthy brawl in the second period that resulted in 86 
penalty minutes. All 12 players on the ice drew penalties. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Vancouver 2 -- Power-play goals by Paul MacLean and Brett Hull 57 
seconds apart late in the second period at Vancouver carried the Blues to their 
fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis scored all but one of its goals on the power play as the Blues moved 
into second place in the Norris Division, one point ahead of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean tied the score, 2-2, with his 18th goal of the season during a two-man 
advantage at 17:15. Hull then scored the game-winner, his 38th goal of the 
season, at 18:12. He is one goal behind league leader Pat LaFontaine of the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Brind'Amour, Sergio Momesso and Steve Tuttle scored the other St. Louis 
goals as the Blues handed the Canucks their third defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Linden and Dan Quinn scored for Vancouver, which was outshot, 31-23. DAN

NEWSWIRE: FORMER BENGAL WILSON ARRESTED NEAR GARDENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Wilson, banned from the NFL for life for using cocaine the night before 
the 1989 Super Bowl, was arrested Friday for scuffling with officers and 
possessing drug paraphernalia. Wilson, the former Banning High and Cincinnati 
Bengal running back, was arrested only days after Penthouse magazine published 
a story in which Wilson accused two teammates of joining him in a Super Bowl 
drug party. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, Wilson had said he was drug free. 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said there was no 
evidence Wilson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies patrolling an unincorporated area near Gardena about 1:30 a.m. Friday 
found Wilson in his car in an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies saw a pipe between the two front seats, Ducoulombier said. The pipe 
apparently was used to smoke marijuana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was arrested, booked and held in lieu of $1,000 bail.

EXPLODING PROSPECT GOT QUICK CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should Exploding Prospect win the $200,000 San Fernando Stakes Sunday at Santa 
Anita, give an assist to Dr. Ed Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by shin problems off and on since he arrived at trainer Vladimir 
Cerin's barn in November, 1988, Exploding Prospect came up with some tenderness 
in his left foreleg after his second victory last fall at Oak Tree. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Hill, a Chino acupuncturist. A few minutes and one well-placed needle in 
an ear later, Exploding Prospect's shin woes were over. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to contribute in correcting this problem in about five minutes," 
Cerin said. "We haven't had a problem since. I've used acupuncture before, but 
never with any kind of success. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been this dramatic a result. It was only one treatment and it 
just seemed to hold. I found it best sometimes not to try and understand those 
things, just accept them. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted Dr. Hill because I'm a little hesitant to start injecting to kill 
the pain. I wanted to see if we could get rid of the cause rather than only the 
symptoms. This horse hasn't had a vet bill in two months." 
</P>
<P>
Although it took the son of Miswaki awhile to make it to the races, Exploding 
Prospect has made the most of his opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing a troubled fourth in his debut Oct. 5, the 4-year-old has 
strung together three consecutive victories. He easily disposed of maidens in 
his second start, then handled winners and two turns in his next appearance, 
going a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to Hollywood Park, Irving and Marge Cowan's colt went virtually wire to 
wire in the Affirmed Handicap, outrunning Splurger, Flying Continental and 
others. In doing so, he also gave Cerin his biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to make it four consecutive wins, Exploding Prospect is facing his 
stiffest challenge in the San Fernando, the middle leg of the Charles H. Strub 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
He will be traveling a mile and an eighth for the first time and the field 
includes Malibu Stakes winner and probable favorite Music Merci, Malibu 
runner-up Exemplary Leader, Opening Verse, the unluckiest horse of the meeting, 
Splurger and Flying Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed with Exploding Prospect from the moment he set eyes on him, Cerin is 
hopeful heading into the San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to have improved since his last race," said Cerin, who boasts some 
quality in his stable of 12. Besides Exploding Prospect, he also trains 
Hollywood Reporter, who upset Music Merci in a division of the Spotlight 
Handicap last spring, the hard-knocking Lady Brunicardi and the stakes-placed 
Yes I'm Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trained superbly and he's done everything we've asked him to do and 
probably just a little better than anticipated," Cerin said. "We've tried to 
get him to rate (run slightly off the pace) a little bit and we seem to have 
accomplished that as well." 
</P>
<P>
With Exploding Prospect having won twice at a mile, Cerin wasn't eager to 
shorten him up. Hence, the decision to skip the seven-furlong Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like it would have been counter-productive to do that and put speed 
back into him," he said. "Our goal is to win 10-furlong races with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a mile and a quarter's within his reach. I hope I'm right and I hope 
we'll have the opportunity to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Such a chance will be available Feb. 4 in the Strub Stakes. Whether Exploding 
Prospect returns in the $500,000 Grade I depends on what happens Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is so difficult to predict," Cerin said. "They say there's only one 
way to win a race and many ways to lose. If he comes up with a tremendous 
effort, that would help earn him a spot in the Strub. Winning would make it a 
lot sweeter. I know he's in great shape. He's beaten some of the entrants and 
hopefully he can beat the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather (he) not have the lead. He doesn't need the lead, but if they go 
very slowly, he'll take it. I believe he's good enough where he can dictate the 
pace in the race by sitting second or third." 
</P>
<P>
With Laffit Pincay, who rode Exploding Prospect in the Affirmed, staying on 
Music Merci and Gary Stevens, who was aboard for his first two wins, sticking 
with Splurger, Pat Valenzuela has the mount Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela hasn't worked Exploding Prospect but the trainer doesn't consider 
that a minus. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tremendous faith in my exercise rider, Jesse Marquez," Cerin said. "So 
long as the jockey has confidence in me and my ability, I feel that he'll 
follow my instructions and Patrick does have confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Others entered in the San Fernando, which has been demoted to a Grade II stake, 
were Raise A Stanza, who is also entered in the San Carlos Handicap today, 
River Master, Live The Dream, Crown Collection and Secret Slew, who will be 
ridden by Bill Shoemaker. After the San Fernando, Shoemaker will fly to Bay 
Meadows and make his final appearance there Monday. . . . After drawing the 
rail in his last two starts, Olympic Prospect drew the outside for the 
seven-furlong San Carlos. His main rivals in the $110,500 race are Tanker Port, 
who is unbeaten in four starts on the dirt, Oraibi and Candi's Gold. 
</P>
<P>
An off track is a possibility for the San Fernando, but it doesn't worry 
Vladimir Cerin. "I have no reason to believe Exploding Prospect won't handle 
mud," he said. "A good horse should handle any surface." . . . The California 
Thoroughbred Breeders' Assn. will hold its California Winter Mixed Sale Monday 
and Tuesday at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, nominated for the Strub, worked seven furlongs on the turf in 1:26 
3/5 for trainer Ron McAnally. Preparing for a possible return late next month, 
Magical Mile went half a mile in :51 4/5. . . . The William P. Kyne Handicap 
will be simulcast locally from Bay Meadows after Santa Anita's ninth race. The 
Kyne, which figures to be run over a muddy track, drew 11 entrants, including 
Happy Toss, Honor Medal, Variety Road and No Marker.

BOWLING: RON WILLIAMS WINS TOP QUALIFYING POSITION AFTER MATCH-PLAY PORTION OF 
TOURNAMENT.

<P>
It's showtime for pro bowling today. 
</P>
<P>
The scene inside Gable House Bowl in Torrance completely changes from a center 
full of bowling thunder to utter silence between shots as ABC hauls out the 
television cameras for the 29th consecutive year to give the nation a view of 
the AC-Delco PBA final at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Only five bowlers from an original field of 160 will be on the lanes for an 
hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
A limited audience of 600 is expected to crowd around Lanes 13 and 14 to watch 
firsthand a four-game elimination to decide who takes home the $35,000 first 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
Competing for that money will be these finalists, with their seedings in the 
order they finished after 42 games: 
</P>
<P>
1. Ron Williams from Texas; 2. Mark Thayer from Indiana; 3. Dave Husted from 
Oregon; 4. Marshall Holman, the all-time money leader from Oregon, and 5. Mark 
Williams, also of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
California just missed making the final when Mark Baker of Huntington Beach 
fell a few pins shy despite a 247 score in the 42nd game. 
</P>
<P>
In the elimination of one-game matches, No. 5 will open against No. 4 with the 
winner taking on No. 3. The winner of that match faces No. 2 to decide the 
opponent for Ron Williams in the title showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Aulby, the 1989 money champion, scored the tournament's third 300 game 
Friday. He had another near miss at the end of the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The scene for today's play dramatically changes for the players. 
</P>
<P>
The silence between shots is so deafening during the show "you can actually 
hear it," said 16-year ABC-TV bowling analyst Nelson Burton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"Glare from the TV lights gives the lanes a totally different look to the 
bowler," said Burton, winner of seven career PBA titles on television. "The 
adrenaline flows and the heartbeat goes up from the pressure of a sudden death 
match . 
</P>
<P>
Bowling Notes 
</P>
<P>
A 300 game today can earn the bowler additional prizes -- a new car from the 
tournament sponsor and $100,000 from another PBA tour sponsor. Pete McCordic 
was first to collect the money jackpot with a TV 300 several seasons ago here. 
</P>
<P>
Most bizarre happening in a title rolloff, Burton recalled, occurred at Gable 
House Bowl in 1983. "Leaving the 4-7-6-9-10 pins after striking in the 10th 
frame, Don Genalo was so upset he threw his last ball into the gutter, not 
realizing he only needed one more pin to defeat Jimmie Pritts. Genalo thought 
he had lost the match and forgot to check with the scorekeeper. Quite a faux 
pas, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
The PBA tour is featuring more than $7 million in prize money on the 1990 tour 
of 37 tournaments. Next stop is Las Vegas.

<P>
For most of its recent history, the San Diego Symphony's forays into the 
musical avant garde have been as rare as Def Leppard doing Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when former music director David Atherton resurrected "Deserts," a 
classic Edgar Varese score with a raucous tape component, the Civic Theatre 
audience nearly went into cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, to inaugurate its new Pulitzer series featuring music by 
contemporary American composers, the symphony traveled to UC San Diego's 
Mandeville Auditorium, a local safe house for contemporary musical expression. 
Guest composer and conductor Charles Wuorinen introduced to San Diego two of 
his recent orchestral works paired with two Stravinsky pieces to an audience 
that was as small as it was loudly appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's electric performance of Wuorinen's percussive, visceral 
"Bamboola Squared" for orchestra and tape made the venture worthwhile. Composed 
for a 1984 New York new music festival, "Bamboola Squared" lived up to the high 
critical acclaim of its debut. 
</P>
<P>
It is a colorful, densely scored orchestral essay that seemed to fuse Alban 
Berg's declamatory operatic style with Stravinsky's motivic development. Oddly, 
the monochromatic tape part, which alternated with the orchestra in concerto 
fashion, sounded tame and unadventurous contrasted with Wuorinen's brilliant 
orchestral writing. 
</P>
<P>
A more recent Wuorinen opus, "Machault mon chou," showed the composer in a 
less-flattering light, however. This brassy, noisy melange of portions of 
Guillaume de Machaut's 14th-Century "Messe de Nostre Dame" would have made a 
nifty soundtrack for Kenneth Branagh's action-oriented "Henry V" film, but it 
sounded unintentionally humorous in a concert setting. The heavy percussion and 
larger-than-life orchestration of "Machault mon chou" made about as much sense 
as, say, a concert band arrangement of Mozart's "Requiem." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Stravinsky work added much to the concert, nor did the players evidence 
much enthusiasm for these stilted exercises. The "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto is 
little more than leftovers from the composer's own "Histoire du Soldat" baked 
in a concerto grosso casserole, and "Monumentum pro Gesualdo di Venosa" is a 
pointless orchestration of 16th-Century madrigals. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, during Wuorinen's student years, when even Stravinsky's 
scribbled grocery lists were hailed as monumental art. How foolish that 
uncritical hero worship now seems. But don't tell our distinguished guest 
composer.

FORD TO SELL AEROSPACE UNIT AND FOCUS ON CARS; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOBILES: WITH U.S. DEFENSE BUDGETS SHRINKING AND THE AUTO BUSINESS GROWING 
MORE COMPETITIVE, THE FIRM HAS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ITS RESOURCES.

<P>
In one of the first attempts by a major American corporation to pull out of the 
defense industry since the revolutionary changes now sweeping Eastern Europe 
began to place intense budget pressure on the Pentagon, Ford said Friday that 
it plans to sell its Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace division and 
concentrate more of its resources on the car business. 
</P>
<P>
With its once-enormous cash reserves gradually dwindling thanks to an auto 
sales slump and a series of non-automotive acquisitions, Ford is likely to use 
the money it raises from the sale of Ford Aerospace in an effort to become more 
competitive against the growing threat posed by Japanese auto companies. "The 
decision to sell Ford Aerospace reflects the intention to concentrate our 
resources on our other businesses," Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said. 
There was no indication Friday of who might buy the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace, with 3,000 employees in Newport Beach and 17,000 nationwide, 
produces a range of products for the military and for civilian space programs, 
including missiles, satellites and space ground station systems. Ford also 
recently acquired BDM International, a large defense industry management 
consulting firm that has been merged into the aerospace unit. Ford Aerospace 
had 1989 contract awards worth $1.83 billion, of which 66% were defense 
related. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's move comes in the early stages of what is likely to be a massive 
restructuring throughout the defense sector, as the Pentagon budget shrinks now 
that the war threat from the Soviet Bloc has been dramatically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more importantly for Ford, the decision also comes in the midst of 
the worst downturn in the auto industry since the recession of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And in order to keep up with the Japanese, who are pouring dozens of new models 
into the American marketplace, Ford realizes that it must spend billions of 
dollars to quickly update its car lines. In 1989, for instance, Ford had to 
invest roughly $6.5 billion in capital programs, about twice as much as it 
spent in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Ford had enough money in its kitty to pay for its new car 
product programs; in 1987, the auto maker had more than $10 billion in cash and 
securities on hand. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of big acquisitions outside of its core North American automotive 
operations has eroded much of that cushion. Today, analysts say, Ford has only 
about $5 billion left in that cash pool. 
</P>
<P>
So the sale of Ford Aerospace -- which analysts say could bring between $800 
million and $1 billion -- could help pay for new cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Ford has come to the conclusion that it is going to need as much capital as it 
can muster to grow its auto business," said Jack Kirnan, automotive analyst 
with the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm. "And defense doesn't look 
too promising." 
</P>
<P>
But with defense industry stocks taking a beating and many other companies 
thinking about getting out of the business, Ford probably won't be able to get 
as much it would like for its aerospace operations. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 68 defense companies or operations have been privately put up for 
sale, making it a "buyer's market in defense properties," Kirnan said. "Ford 
probably could have gotten $1.5 billion or more for it two years ago," Kirnan 
added, compared to today's likely price. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell apparently follows a broad review by Ford's top management 
of all of its non-automotive operations to determine which businesses the 
world's second-largest auto maker wants to keep in the 1990s. Besides autos, 
the company has apparently decided that it wants to stay in only one area -- 
financial services, in which it has made several major acquisitions in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
One early result of its review of its diversified operations came last year, 
when Ford sold off Rouge Steel, its troubled steel-making subsidiary. The auto 
maker is also reportedly considering the sale of its Ford New Holland unit, 
which makes agricultural equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Ford is getting rid of its stuff that doesn't seem to have a focus," said 
Maryann Keller, an automotive analyst with the Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; 
Birney brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of Ford Aerospace, they decided not to develop their aerospace 
business beyond what it was," Keller added. "Ford Aerospace is a tiny player; 
it isn't No. 1 or 2 in any area, so Ford decided it had other fish to fry." 
</P>
<P>
Keller argued that Ford Aerospace's fate was sealed after Ford failed to make a 
major acquisition in the defense industry in the mid-1980s. Most notably, Ford 
lost out to General Motors in its bid for Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
If it had won Hughes, Ford would overnight have become one of the nation's 
biggest defense contractors. But without Hughes, Ford Aerospace remained just 
the nation's 23rd-largest military contractor, and the 10th-largest space 
program contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"When they didn't get Hughes, they were left with a little company competing 
against giants," Keller observed. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's decision to husband its cash for the coming crisis in the auto industry 
parallels a similar move by Chrysler, which has been trying to sell its 
Chrysler Technologies subsidiary. That consists of Gulfstream Aerospace, which 
makes corporate jets, along with Electrospace Systems, a smaller defense 
electronics unit. 
</P>
<P>
But the decisions at Ford and Chrysler to refocus on autos have come late in 
the game. While Detroit's auto makers were using their enormous profits in the 
mid-1980s to diversify away from cars, the Japanese were concentrating billions 
of dollars on the auto business; the results of that campaign can now be seen 
in the form of new cars and trucks at this winter's auto shows in Tokyo, 
Detroit and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"These companies (Ford and Chrysler) are now starting to realize that they did 
underspend in their core business," Kirnan said.

WELLS FARGO DECIDES TO CLOSE FOR KING HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

After numerous calls from customers, Wells Fargo Bank reversed itself Friday 
and decided to keep its 462 branch offices closed for Martin Luther King Day on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Hoogerwerf, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank's public relations 
office received about 30 calls from customers Friday morning about its plan to 
be open for business for the first time on the slain civil rights leader's 
birthday, a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
She said there were additional calls to branch offices and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
"That's (the number of calls) a lot to us," Hoogerwerf said. Callers "were 
concerned that we weren't observing Martin Luther King Day, and we know that 
for every person that calls there are probably some more out there who feel the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, like rival Security Pacific National Bank, had originally planned 
to be open Monday, citing the need to be more like a retailer, providing longer 
hours for customers. Security Pacific's plans were unclear Friday night as 
spokespeople could not be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo still plans to be open on Presidents Day, Columbus Day and Veterans 
Day, but spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said the bank will review decisions on those 
holidays "on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, called the two banks' decisions to remain open a type of 
"retrenchment". 
</P>
<P>
And Patrick Patterson, Western regional council for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, said it is important for businesses to observe King's 
birthday. "In this climate that we have today, where there is a resurgence of 
racial violence, bombings and murder that appears to be linked to racism, it 
becomes more important for people to recognize this holiday," Patterson said.

JUDGE NARROWS CHEVRON SUIT AGAINST PENNZOIL; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: ONLY ONE CLAIM REMAINS IN A LEGAL BATTLE THAT CHALLENGES THE INTENTIONS 
BEHIND THE PURCHASE OF $2.1 BILLION WORTH OF STOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Friday dismissed all but one claim in Chevron Corp.'s 
lawsuit that accused Pennzoil Co. of lying about its intentions when it spent 
$2.1 billion to buy an 8.8% stake in the San Francisco-based energy giant last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, contained in a 13-page opinion, was a significant victory for 
Houston-based Pennzoil, which has said it bought the Chevron stock only for 
investment purposes and to defer federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco dismissed most of the 
claims in a lawsuit filed Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that Pennzoil violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act and 
securities laws in buying Chevron stock. Chevron, alleging that Pennzoil sought 
to force Chevron to restructure, had asked that Pennzoil be forced to sell its 
stake and be prevented from buying more Chevron stock. 
</P>
<P>
The judge allowed Chevron to pursue a portion of a claim that Pennzoil 
committed fraud by not truthfully stating its intentions in a Securities and 
Exchange Commission 13-D filing disclosing the stock purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Henderson wrote: "Chevron's factual support is unquestionably weak and 
certainly does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion or even demonstrate a 
probability that Pennzoil has filed a misleading Schedule 13-D; at best, it 
creates a suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
"Pennzoil is extraordinarily happy with this decision," said Stephen V. Bomse, 
Pennzoil's lawyer in San Francisco. "The lawsuit has been materially narrowed, 
and we are that much closer to putting the matter to rest -- something we hope 
to do finally in due course." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron saw the decision differently, arguing that it sustained Chevron's right 
to pursue the matter. "The portion of the lawsuit dismissed by the court will 
have no significant effect upon Chevron's continued prosecution of its 
complaint and its ongoing discovery," the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron added that the judge's ruling reaffirmed Chevron's right to certain 
Pennzoil documents relating to Pennzoil's decision to buy Chevron stock. 
Chevron has already received some documents and will go into U.S. District 
Court in San Francisco next Wednesday to argue for more. Attorney Bomse called 
Chevron's pursuit "a fishing expedition." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron filed its lawsuit on the evening of Dec. 7 -- only hours after Pennzoil 
disclosed that it had bought the Chevron stock with most of its $2.6-billion 
settlement with Texaco Inc. in Pennzoil's dispute over Getty Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil's disclosure, contained in a 13-D filing, confirmed weeks of rumors 
that an investor was buying up Chevron shares. There was speculation at the 
time that an outsider intended to mount a hostile takeover or force a 
restructuring of Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
But in its filing, Pennzoil said it had bought the stake only as a passive 
investor and to avoid paying an estimated $800 million in federal taxes on its 
Texaco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Pennzoil believes that its investment in the shares may provide Pennzoil the 
opportunity to defer for an indefinite period a portion of the federal income 
taxes that would otherwise be payable currently on the litigation settlement 
proceeds," Pennzoil said in the filing. The swiftness with which Chevron filed 
its challenge, however, suggested that Chevron executives, led by Chairman 
Kenneth T. Derr, were suspicious of Pennzoil and its colorful chairman, J. Hugh 
Liedtke. Chevron lawyers reportedly went to the house of a judge at 6:45 p.m. 
to get him to sign a temporary restraining order to prevent Pennzoil from 
filing suit anywhere but San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Pennzoil has failed to reveal its true intent, which is to influence Chevron 
management decisions and/or force an extraordinary restructuring of Chevron," 
Chevron argued in its original complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was only part of an elaborate anti-takeover defense mounted by 
Chevron, including strengthening a shareholder's rights plan and lining up $5 
billion in credit. Friday's decision was only the latest loss in the rapidly 
moving suit. On Dec. 27, the temporary restraining order was lifted, though 
Pennzoil gave no indication it would file suit. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Henderson dismissed Chevron's claim that Pennzoil violated 
antitrust laws, a portion of its claim that Pennzoil lied on its 13-D filing 
and its request for declaratory judgment that Chevron's shareholder's rights 
plan were valid and enforceable.

U.S. Memories to Make Announcement: Amid growing signs that the proposed 
chip-making cooperative has not attracted sufficient industry support, 
organizers of the venture have called a press conference Monday morning. 
Although speculation was rife that the venture would be folded, no details were 
available. Since its unveiling in June, the venture has not attracted a single 
new investor beyond its initial seven backers.

U.S. Airlines Post Records in '89: U.S. scheduled airlines reported record 
levels of passenger miles, air cargo and employment in 1989, the Air Transport 
Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
But the total number of passengers carried and profits for the year through 
September were down, the trade group reported in a year-end review. It said 
passenger miles rose by 2%, to 430 billion miles, cargo freight was up 7% 
during the first 11 months of 1989 to 9.2 billion tons, and employment rose by 
about 2%, to 490,000. The ATA said the airlines carried about 453 million 
passengers, down slightly from 1988's 455 million.

RTC to Sell Another 40 S&amp;Ls: The U.S. Resolution Trust Corp. plans to put 
another 40 insolvent saving and loan institutions up for sale, executive 
director David Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC, which is responsible for disposing of insolvent thrifts, Thursday 
released a list of nine institutions in seven states that would be sold. Cooke 
told the RTC board that a list of the latest 40 failed thrifts being offered to 
private bidders will be issued next week. There are about 286 insolvent thrifts 
now under federal control, including six whose sales are pending. The RTC has 
already sold or closed another 37 institutions.

December, bringing to $7.64 billion the total amount of sales for the year, the 
Treasury Department reported. The 3% increase of sales over calendar 1988 also 
increased the amount of bonds held by the public to a record $117.7 billion. 
Savings bonds currently earn interest at a rate of 6.98% when held five years 
or longer.

PERSONAL FINANCE: DEALING WITH CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No question, figuring out the tax laws is a royal pain in the you-know-what. 
And just when you figure you've got current rules licked, those folks in 
Congress and the Internal Revenue Service slap on some new doozies. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, they've done it again. Several changes have taken effect for 1989 
or 1990 tax returns. Some are generally beneficial, such as those affecting 
certain fringe benefits, savings bonds and business use of cars. But most are 
not, cutting deductions or making things more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, there are more negatives affecting more people," says William G. 
Brennan, partner at the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a brief rundown of some key changes affecting individuals: 
</P>
<P>
* Child care. Starting with 1989 returns -- the ones you file this year -- the 
child-care credit is available only for payments made to care for a child age 
12 or under, unless that child is disabled. Previously, the age limit for 
qualifying was 14 or under. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if you claim this credit, you now must provide the IRS with the name and 
Social Security number of whoever provided the care. Failure to do so can 
result in disallowance of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
* Kiddie tax. On 1989 returns, for the first time, you can report your child's 
income on your return under most conditions. But the youngster must be 13 or 
under with income not more than $5,000 derived from interest, dividends or 
other non-wage sources. 
</P>
<P>
* Children as dependents. Starting with 1989 returns, you must report a Social 
Security number for any child age 2 or older that you claim as a dependent. 
Previously, only children age 5 or older needed a number. 
</P>
<P>
Also, starting with 1989 returns, you may no longer claim exemptions for 
children who are full-time students age 24 or older with gross incomes 
exceeding $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Interest expenses. You can deduct only 20% of the interest you paid during 
1989 on credit cards, car loans, personal loans and other non-mortgage debt. 
Only 10% will be deductible for interest paid this year; next year the break 
will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
* Fringe benefits. Payments up to $5,250 you receive this year for tuition from 
your employer -- usually to finish college or take job-related graduate courses 
-- are tax free if you receive them before Sept. 30, 1990. This break had ended 
after 1988, but was reinstated retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
* Self-employment benefits. If you are self-employed, you can continue 
deducting 25% of what you pay for family health insurance through Sept. 30. 
That break had been set to expire last year. 
</P>
<P>
* 401(k) plans. The amount you can contribute to these popular company savings 
plans will rise this year, probably to around $8,000 from $7,627 last year. The 
new cap will be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
* Savings bonds. Interest earned on Series EE savings bonds bought starting 
this year will be exempt from federal tax if proceeds are used to finance 
college education and if certain other criteria are met. 
</P>
<P>
* Cellular phones. If you purchase one starting this year, you must keep 
records of business use to claim deductions. And to use accelerated 
depreciation to deduct expenses, you must use the phones more than 50% for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
* Business use of cars. For 1989 returns, you can deduct 25.5 cents for the 
first 15,000 miles and 11 cents thereafter. Starting for 1990 returns -- the 
ones you will file next year -- you can deduct 26 cents for every mile, 
regardless of the total. 
</P>
<P>
* Low-income housing credit. This tax shelter has been extended for another 
year, and more higher-income investors are eligible. In the past, you would not 
have qualified for the credit if your adjusted gross income topped $250,000. 
But if you invest this year in qualifying properties placed into service 
starting this year, you can claim the credit regardless of income.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW SAVERS FARE IF AILING S&amp;L TAKEN OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: About six years ago, I opened a 10-year savings account at an S&amp;L 
that allowed additional deposits to the account to earn the initial rate of 
interest, regardless of the prevailing rate at the time of the deposit. I was 
able to "lock in" an interest rate that is quite favorable by today's 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
However, now this institution is listed among the nation's "troubled" S&amp;Ls, 
and I am worried that it will be bought out and the terms of my savings 
certificate will be nullified. If a new buyer takes over my institution and 
breaks the savings account contract, offering a substitute rate that is 
considerably lower, must I accept whatever interest rate the buyer offers, or 
may I withdraw my funds without penalty? I am really concerned that the saver 
is being sacrificed so the buyers of these troubled institutions can get cheap 
deposits to "save" the S&amp;Ls. -- B. W. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your situation highlights a frequently overlooked participant in the 
current S&amp;L mess: the saver. Although your account is probably covered by 
federal deposit insurance, you have unfortunately discovered that savers do not 
necessarily emerge untouched by an institution's failure. In fact, in order for 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which oversees the merger of insolvent 
institutions into healthy ones, to find a buyer willing to take over a failed 
institutions, something has to give. Often it is the interest rate on deposits, 
usually higher than the industry average, that the failed institution had been 
paying to attract savers. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC takes the position that the failed institution's savings account 
contracts are unbreakable only as long as that institution is in business. 
According to this reasoning, once the association is sold to or merged with 
another association, those savings contracts are not necessarily in force. 
</P>
<P>
So if your institution is taken over by another association that later decides 
to break your savings account contract, you have a choice: Accept the new rate 
of interest offered by the buyer, or take your money elsewhere. If you elect 
the latter, you will not be penalized for withdrawing your funds before the 
account matures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calculating Minimum IRA Withdrawal 
</P>
<P>
Q: My individual retirement account is in certificates of deposit distributed 
among three different banks. When I finally begin taking mandatory 
distributions, does the Internal Revenue Service require that I withdraw the 
minimum from each bank account, or may I withdraw the combined minimum total 
from the one account where I am earning the least interest? I have received 
conflicting answers to this. -- B. H. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: There has been a great deal of confusion about this issue because the IRS 
has never definitively laid down the law. But our experts say you may elect to 
take the withdrawal from whatever account or combination of accounts you want, 
provided that you do indeed take the minimum required distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum withdrawal should be calculated based on the total in all IRAs. 
Take the distribution from the account of your choice and then notify the 
trustees of your other accounts of what you are doing. This final step is 
important because these account trustees could review your account activity and 
determine that you had not made the proper withdrawals and force you into a 
lengthly discussion. Worse yet, they could just calculate the minimum required 
withdrawal and send you a check for it. Untangling all this would be a pain in 
the neck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes in Law for Deals Between Spouses 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, a reader asked what the tax consequences would be if she 
sold some shares of stock to her husband. We said that if she realized a gain 
from the deal, her profits would be taxable. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to recent changes in the tax laws -- specifically, Section 
1041 of the Internal Revenue Code -- transactions between spouses are not 
taxable. Instead, the seller reports no gain or loss, and the buyer takes the 
seller's taxable basis in the asset. This means that when the buyer later sells 
those shares, his taxable gain is the difference between the sales price and 
the price his spouse originally paid for those shares. 
</P>
<P>
Although the title of Section 1041 would lead one to believe that it applies 
only to transactions between spouses conducted in connection with a divorce, 
Los Angeles attorney Paul Gordon Hoffman assures us that "it is clear from the 
language of the law, congressional reports and Treasury regulations that the 
section applies to all transactions between spouses, whether or not they are 
connected to a divorce."

SOVIET UNCERTAINTY GIVES DOLLAR A BOOST

<P>
A wave of uncertainty over Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political 
future pushed the dollar mostly higher in domestic dealings, overshadowing two 
bearish reports on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices generally rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late 
bid of $414.50, up 90 cents an ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange, 
however, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 80 cents to $413.20. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar took a hit overseas and traded sharply lower in domestic dealings 
following negative reports on U.S. inflation and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the session, traders said talk that Gorbachev may not survive the 
intense political pressure surrounding Lithuanian demands for secession pushed 
the dollar higher. 
</P>
<P>
During a trip to Lithuania, Gorbachev promised a referendum on a law that would 
require republics to hold their own votes on breaking away, but currency 
traders said there were rumors he was not supported by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The speculation is that Gorbachev is not dealing from a large power base 
anymore," said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at Bank of Boston's New York 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"And when in doubt, buy the buck," he said, referring to the dollar as the 
safe-haven currency during times of political instability. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncertainty, Marc Chandler, an analyst with Chicago-based Money 
Market Services International, stressed that "the economic fundamentals 
continue to work against the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
The inflation and retail sales reports, which point jointly to higher inflation 
and an economic slowdown, initially rocked the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets interpreted the reports as a sign the Federal Reserve 
would not lower interest rates in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.35 Japanese yen, up from 145.27. Later in 
London, the dollar closed higher at 145.40 yen. In New York, the dollar 
finished at 145.74 yen, up from 145.45 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6705, more expensive for buyers than 
Thursday's late $1.6575. In New York, it cost $1.6610 to buy one pound, more 
expensive than $1.6598 on Thursday.

MAXICARE SAYS IT WILL TRIM PAYROLL AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: THE AILING HMO IS TRYING TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY 
PROCEEDINGS.

Embattled Maxicare Health Plans Inc., once the nation's largest for-profit 
health maintenance organization, will again trim its payroll by laying off an 
undisclosed number of workers at its Los Angeles headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, which at its height in the mid-1980s employed 7,000 workers and 
provided medical services for 2 million people in 27 states, said it decided to 
trim its 800-person work force to further cut costs and reorganize itself so 
that it can emerge from its nearly yearlong bout with Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"The layoffs will not be inconsequential," said Maxicare spokesman James B. 
Lucas, who nevertheless declined to say how many Maxicare employees might be 
affected. But he said senior managers as well as support staff would be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing the decentralization of management functions at Maxicare and 
moving authority and accountability down to the local level as we prepare to 
emerge from reorganization," Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on layoffs, which was reached in a special senior management 
meeting Thursday, came two days after Maxicare had formally filed a proposed 
plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, which last March filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, has proposed to distribute cash, notes and a new 
issue of common stock to satisfy creditor claims. The proposed layoffs, which 
had not been disclosed to employees, were not mentioned in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an uphill battle because their name has been so badly damaged by 
what's gone on," said Randy Huyser, a health-care analyst at Montgomery 
Securities. "It's a real shame that Maxicare shot itself in the foot by 
leveraging itself" in the mid-1980s when it got heavily into debt to buy 
competing health maintenance organizations.

PLUNGING SALES PROMPT GM TO SLASH ITS COSTS;

<P>
General Motors Corp., which is racing to slash costs faster than it loses 
sales, said Friday that it will reduce hiring, delay product plans and induce 
salaried workers either to resign or retire early. 
</P>
<P>
The latest spending cuts come amid a slumping domestic car market and 
intensified competition. 
</P>
<P>
The program has no target or deadline, spokesman Terry Sullivan said. It is 
separate from GM's "Action Plan" of 1987 that aims to slash up to $13 billion 
in costs by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the increasing competitive nature of the automotive industry, we 
are intensifying our cost-reduction activities throughout General Motors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
GM, the world's largest auto maker, is struggling to avoid a debacle as it 
loses sales at a dangerously fast clip. For three months running, GM has posted 
its lowest car-market share in nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
GM's slide in the domestic car market has been accelerating over the past 10 
years. For the first six years of the 1980s, its market share slid five 
percentage points to 41% from 46%. But it took only another three years to 
plunge another six points, to 35%, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The new cost cutting is another sign of concern about the industry conditions. 
Car and truck sales have been slumping since October, when the 1990 model year 
began, and officials believe that the downturn will last through the first half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a classic reaction to structural change in the industry," said 
auto analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York, referring to 
recent moves to trim costs and concentrate on car and truck making. 
</P>
<P>
GM, along with its Big Three cousins Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., on 
Thursday announced temporary plant closings for later this month and into 
February that will idle 58,600 employees for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdowns resulted from swelling inventories of new cars and slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Chrysler Corp. is trying to trim at least $1 billion from its $26-billion 
annual budget by the end of 1990. Ford Motor Co. has no formal cost-cutting 
program, but spokesman Tom Foote said the auto maker is examining expenses and 
eliminating redundancies and excess. 
</P>
<P>
GM already has cut more than $11 billion under its cost-reduction plan, 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, some employees younger than 53 will be offered bonuses to 
quit between March 1 and June 30. Older workers will be offered early 
retirement packages between April 1 and Sept. 30, spokeswoman Patricia Malloy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring will be limited to about 500 recent college graduates in technical 
fields during the first half of the year, she said. In 1989, GM hired about 
1,700 college graduates and a smaller number of other workers, Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it looks as if our recruiting on college campuses this year will 
definitely be more limited than it was last year," she said.

FOR FORD WORKERS, NEWS BRINGS RELIEF 
</P>

Ford Aerospace workers said the reports Friday that the company is up for sale 
left them feeling uncertain about their futures but also relieved that months 
of rumors and questions about the troubled defense contractor's fate were at 
least being partially answered. 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt the sale was coming. Employees said management has been 
paring the work force and sprucing up the sprawling Newport Beach plant as if 
it were being prepared for the sales block. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns that a new owner might eliminate jobs or move the Newport Beach 
operation out of the local area have already prompted some employees to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about the future. I've got a kid on the way," said Ken Hay, an 
engineer at the plant who said he gave notice Friday morning that was quitting 
the company for a job elsewhere. "There are other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Other employees said they plan to stick it out. "We're not completely worried. 
It's just business as usual," said one 25-year employee who was driving herself 
and a friend to lunch. "You hear these things for months. I'm not that 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the defense plant's 2,700 employees, however, Friday was anything 
but a typical day. They clustered around TV sets to view videotapes in which 
Ford Motor Co. officials notified them of the sale and offered words of 
reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
Company supervisors handed out leaflets printed on crisp blue paper that tried 
to answer questions that employees might have about the sale. Workers seemed 
more concerned about keeping their benefits than losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer James D. Hynes and other longtime employees expressed concern about 
their retirement benefits. Ford spokesman Bill Selover said the pension plans 
are vested and the benefits are protected. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern was whether supervisors and certain high-ranking employees 
would be able to retain their discount leases on new Ford automobiles. Selover 
said that they won't be able to keep the cars on the same terms after the sale, 
but that the company will provide terms in which they can be returned. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Gary Wood said the company has had a hard time making a profit on its 
government contracts and has been trying to cut costs in various ways. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall feeling is Ford got (news of the sale) out in the open. Now what 
is the next step? Do people start sending out resumes? Some already have," said 
Wood, who has worked at the plant for nine years.

When Ford Aerospace demonstrated a new tank gun for U.S. Army leaders several 
years ago, the radar-controlled turret swung past its intended target and 
instead turned on a reviewing stand, sending the spectators diving for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Although no shots were fired at the generals and Ford executives, the 
unfortunate incident was the sort of extraordinary faux pas that can put a 
lasting tarnish on a firm's image in the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace, which was put up for sale Friday, has long suffered an image 
problem -- not so much because it builds defective products but because it has 
never moved to the front ranks of the markets in which it operates. 
</P>
<P>
The company builds a somewhat odd collection of weapons and spacecraft, a 
product assortment that dates back in part to the defunct Philco refrigerator 
and television business that Ford acquired in the early 1960s. Ford ranks as 
only the nation's 23rd-largest defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ford Aerospace was bound to be one of the early victims of the 
defense industry shakeout, in which mergers will reduce defense overcapacity 
amid dwindling federal arms budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and defense industry insiders believe that Ford Aerospace is likely to 
be broken up and sold piecemeal to stronger contractors who want to bolster 
their own operations in such areas as tactical missiles, satellites and 
electronic command systems. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, it was learned Friday that Carlyle Group, a Washington-based 
merchant banking concern of which former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci is a 
vice chairman, has had discussions with Ford about a bid for its defense 
business. Carlyle officials could not be reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said Carlyle was hoping to acquire and restructure Ford 
Aerospace, improving what some experts consider a poorly organized operation, 
and then resell it. 
</P>
<P>
But financial analysts believe that Ford or any intermediary will have a 
difficult time selling Ford Aerospace in one piece or selling even the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Defense units of Honeywell, Tracor, Kodak, Perkin Elmer and Magnavox, among 
others, are already up for sale, according to Joseph Campbell, Paine Webber 
aerospace analyst. Moreover, United Technologies was forced to take its Norden 
unit off the market because no buyers could be found. The same fate befell the 
AIL unit of Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be hard for (Ford) to sell it in one piece because the pieces don't go 
together," said Joseph Campbell, aerospace analyst for the Paine Webber 
investment firm. "It would be hard to find somebody who will want all the 
pieces. Then you have to ask, how good are the pieces?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer, according to many experts is: certainly not the best in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
While other major corporations invested billions of dollars in weapons 
competitions and new facilities during the 1980s, Ford milked its aerospace 
business for cash. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early '80s when the car business was flat on its back . . . Ford 
Aerospace was delivering profit by the wheelbarrow loads to (Ford headquarters 
in) Dearborn," one Ford Aerospace executive said. "To do that there were 
sacrifices made. Now, we are paying the price. Those sacrifices were not doing 
the plant modernization and technology work we should have been doing to keep 
ourselves competitive in the late 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace President Donald B. Rassier said Friday, "It's true that we're 
not necessarily (No.) 1 or (No.) 2 in our markets, but we're quite diversified. 
And diversification is not all bad these days." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ford's image was badly damaged by the Sgt. York, the Army 
anti-aircraft gun that turned on spectators at a demonstration several years 
ago. That program was canceled after Ford had run up losses estimated later at 
$200 million and encountered unending criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you could find a bigger public relations fiasco than to field 
a weapons system that became the laughingstock of the nation," said John 
Heubusch, former chief of staff for Rep. Denny Smith (R-Ore.), a major critic 
of the Sgt. York. "It was really one of the lemons in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Ford Aerospace's various business units are likely to end up with 
companies already doing the same type of business. Thus, the major candidates 
to emerge as buyers for Ford's missile business will be domestic missile 
producers Raytheon, General Dynamics, Texas Instruments and Hughes Aircraft, as 
well as European contractors seeking a toehold in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Rassier said Ford wants to sell the unit as a whole, but that it was too early 
to tell whether that position would change. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at Hughes Aircraft said that company has been examining several pieces 
of Ford Aerospace but that no decision had been made to pursue an acquisition. 
Some sources believe that Hughes Chairman Malcolm R. Currie will be reluctant 
to acquire any defense operation at a time when he is attempting to increase 
Hughes' non-defense business. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford satellite operations could well end up with any one of the U.S. 
spacecraft producers, including Rockwell International, Hughes, General 
Electric, Lockheed, Martin Marietta or TRW. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said in an interview Friday that he is not 
interested in buying Ford Aerospace as an entity but would look at the 
satellite manufacturing operation if it were made available separately. 
</P>
<P>
Ford does not disclose sales for its defense business, but analysts have 
estimated them at anywhere from $1.7 billion to $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Ford Aerospace is solidly profitable and has continued to grow," Ford Chairman 
Donald E. Petersen said Friday in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities estimated that Ford will 
fetch a low of $600 million to $700 million for its aerospace business if it 
sells it whole or as much as $1 billion if it sells it piecemeal. Those prices 
are far below what firms were selling for at the peak of the market, when a 
common rule of thumb was that a firm could fetch $1 for each dollar of sales. 
</P>
<P>
It will also mean that Ford is likely to take a stiff loss on the $475 million 
it paid only two years ago for BDM, a defense consulting and engineering firm 
located in Washington that it merged into Ford Aerospace.

David Frost tied the second-lowest round in PGA Tour history Friday, and it 
could have been even lower. 
</P>
<P>
Frost one-putted 11 of his first 12 holes in the second round of the Tucson 
Open and finished with a 12-under-par 60 on a municipal course. Only a bogey on 
his 16th hole of the day prevented Frost from matching the record 59 Al 
Geiberger shot at the 1977 Memphis Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not at all disappointed," he said. "It's the first time I've ever been in 
this position, and it's three shots better than I've ever shot before . . . I'm 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
Frost one-putted 14 times and scored two eagles and nine birdies in only the 
eighth round of 60 ever recorded in tour competition. The last 60 was shot by 
Sam Snead in the 1957 Dallas Open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his spectacular round, Frost doesn't have sole possession of the lead. 
Jay Haas, who played in a threesome with Frost and Craig Stadler, shot a 64 to 
tie Frost's two-round total of 130. 
</P>
<P>
Stadler was eight strokes back at 138 after shooting a 69 on the 6,902-yard 
Randolph Park course, which usually plays to a par 70 but is listed at 72 for 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who won the World Series of Golf last season, hit a three-wood second 
shot to the green on the third hole (his 12th) and made a 30-foot putt for 
eagle-three. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started thinking about 59," he said. "I needed, what, three 
birdies in six holes? . . . And I made three birdies." 
</P>
<P>
But the bogey on the 356-yard, par-four seventh ruined any chance he had. 
</P>
<P>
Frost drove the fairway and had 107 yards to the pin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was between clubs, and I tried to hit a sand wedge hard," he said. "I didn't 
need to . . . It hit the green and bounced over." 
</P>
<P>
He chipped back to about six feet and missed the putt. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gamez, a 21-year-old rookie who passed up his last season at the 
University of Arizona to join the pro tour, shot a 64 at the TPC at Star Pass 
and was at 131. 
</P>
<P>
The pros played one round on each of the two courses, and will play the final 
two at the more difficult Star Pass layout. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman disqualified himself from one of Australia's richest golf 
tournaments Saturday, saying he accidentally had breached a rule during 
Thursday's first round of the $625,000 Daikyo Palm Meadows Cup in Brisbane. 
</P>
<P>
Norman shot a course-record 63 Friday to take a one-shot lead after two rounds, 
but said Saturday he could not continue, feeling he had breached rules by 
taking illegal relief on the 10th hole on Thursday, when he shot an 
opening-round 66. He also said the 63 should be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned my course record should not stand," he said. "Whatever 
I've done after the 10th (on Thursday) is history." 
</P>
<P>
Norman hit his drive into the water on the 10th Thursday and believed he was 
entitled to total relief from what he thought was a lateral water hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped the ball but it rolled back towards the water and I had to stand in 
the hazard to play the shot," he said. "I dropped it again and then placed it 
believing I had the right to get total relief." 
</P>
<P>
He was advised Saturday he was in breach of the rules.

4 QUARTERBACKS, 1 SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year that can make or break a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell "cat" until he starred in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms was never good enough in New York until he was perfect in a Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Williams never got the payday he deserved until he broke down barriers in 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If this is January, then the NFL spotlight must be on the quarterback. Heading 
into the AFC and NFC championship games, this year's roll call of Final Four 
quarterbacks is typical of the times. 
</P>
<P>
There's Bernie Kosar and John Elway -- the unorthodox, side-arming flinger 
against the once golden boy -- in Sunday's AFC showdown between Cleveland and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
There's Jim Everett and Joe Montana -- the new kid on the block against the 
master -- in the NFC's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in that group is a Super Bowl winner: if it's Montana, a repeat 
winner, waiting the call of fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Elway and Montana know a little about the territory. Elway is a two-time Super 
Bowl loser with the Broncos, born of expectations that at times have been 
surrealistic. Montana is a three-time winner whose former coach was ready to 
phase him out as recently as November 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the four, only Everett has not been drummed through the NFL's school 
of hard knocks. Kosar was booed this season in Cleveland. All he did was win 
four division titles in five years as a pro. Elway was booed in Denver. All he 
did was win a pair of AFC championships. 
</P>
<P>
"There (were) some unpleasant things said and John hasn't had an easy year," 
said Dan Reeves, Elway's coach in Denver. "But he has performed well, and he 
showed last week he still is able to do great things." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, 29, became the third player in NFL history to have five straight 
3,000-yard seasons. Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason are the others. Counting last 
week's come-from-behind win over Pittsburgh, he has brought the Broncos back 16 
times with last-minute rallies. It was Elway's crucial 36-yard completion to 
Vance Johnson on a flea-flicker that set up the Broncos' winning touchdown in a 
24-23 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one thing Marty Schottenheimer appreciates in Elway, it's his 
competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about his mobility and strong arm, the one thing people fail to 
recognize is that he probably is as great a competitor as there is," said 
Schottenheimer, head coach in Kansas City who lost two AFC title games to Elway 
while in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached him in the Pro Bowl, and I've seen enough of him to know the guy 
is a great competitor. And if you look at all four of these quarterbacks, 
that's one common thread they all have." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar's competitiveness helped him endure a year of insult and injury in 
Cleveland. The Browns' quarterback bruised his right elbow in a Week 10 victory 
over Seattle. He played through the pain, and in the next four games the Browns 
went 0-3-1. When he went 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, he was booed at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask Bernie how he is, he won't ever say he's hurting," said Bud Carson, 
who replaced Schottenheimer in Cleveland. "But we've discussed it with the 
doctors and they say he isn't in any career-threatening situation. He just has 
had some different arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes to throw the ball, especially in a big game when we have 
to have it, Bernie comes through. We were much more concerned about him last 
week, health-wise, than this week." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, 26, has had elbow, shoulder and finger ailments this year. Last week, 
with various parts of his anatomy hurting, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 235 
yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite the injuries, Kosar still 
passed for 3,533 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise Schottenheimer. "The thing that stands out is that at a 
point in time when everybody thought he would be at his worst, he got the job 
done," his former coach said. "That speaks volumes about Kosar as a winning 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
At a point in time when then-coach Bill Walsh was ready to pass the 49ers' 
quarterbacking torch from Montana to Steve Young last season, Montana responded 
with some of the best football of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won seven of their last eight games a year ago, and with Montana 
showing the way, capped the season with a dramatic 20-16 victory over 
Cincinnati in Super Bowl XXIII. His 92-yard drive at game's end produced the 
winning touchdown, a 10-yard scoring pass to John Taylor. This year, the 49ers 
are 15-2 going into Sunday's showdown, and Montana has elevated his game still 
another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 33, completed a staggering 70.2 percent of his passes this season and 
posted the highest passer rating in NFL history, 112.4. His 
touchdown-to-interception ratio of 26-8 is the best of his 11-year career. 
Montana was named the NFL's MVP for his superior season. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year 49ers Coach George Seifert, "Any superlative you can use to 
describe him fits." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's next playoff touchdown pass will tie him with Bradshaw for the league 
record of 30. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, there are those who compare young Everett to the veteran 
Montana. In his second full season as the Rams' starting quarterback, Everett 
passed for 4,310 yards and an NFL-high 29 touchdowns. He has a strong arm, 
quick release and soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great compliment," Everett said of the comparison. "He (Montana) has 
proven time and time again he's a Super Bowl winner, and I think that's the 
judgment on quarterbacks. Comparisons are great, but I don't have a Super 
Bowl."

CHENEN'S 3-POINT PLAY LIFTS EL CAMINO REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There El Camino Real High forward Allen Chenen stood Friday night, toeing the 
free-throw line in the Taft gym with two seconds left in a tie game against his 
school's archrival. 
</P>
<P>
These neighborhood and Northwest Valley Conference foes had overcome some early 
sloppiness to play a taut fourth quarter. And now it was up to Chenen, who had 
just converted a clutch, off-balance bank shot to tie the score and then was 
fouled by Taft's Cornell Hill on the play. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was in my feet," Chenen said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
But who needs a heart to sink a game-winning free throw? Not Chenen, whose 
offering hit nothing but net to complete the three-point play and give El 
Camino Real a 54-53 win. 
</P>
<P>
The finish caused El Camino Real Coach Mike McNulty to leap high into the air, 
a rare display of emotion from the usually reserved coach. 
</P>
<P>
Just 30 seconds before Chenen's game-winning play, Taft sophomore Casey 
Sheahan, who scored a team-high 16 points, had drilled a three-point shot, his 
fourth of the game, to give Taft a 53-51 lead, its first since a 6-4 advantage 
early in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sheahan's shot capped a Toreador comeback in which Taft outscore El Camino 
Real, 10-1, in the final four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Taft (12-5, 2-1 in conference play) hurt itself in the first half, making just 
nine of 28 shots and committing numerous turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (5-7, 2-1), meanwhile, wasn't exactly on top of its game despite 
Todd Orlando's game-high 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores made just 11 of 27 first-half shots but led, 24-20, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores built the lead to nine at 35-26 before Taft mounted its run. 
</P>

last week in a two-point win over Granada Hills.

MATADORS OPEN CONFERENCE PLAY WITH 90-78 WIN

So much for statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge came into Friday night's California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. opener at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo shooting 42.2% from the field and just 
61.4% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors turned those numbers upside down, however, shooting 56.7% (34 of 
60) from the field and 73% (19 of 26) from the foul line to defeat the 
Mustangs, 90-78, and snap Cal Poly SLO's four-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second loss in the last 11 games for Cal Poly SLO. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to point out any one player for this win," Northridge Coach Pete 
Cassidy said. "Everyone did so many things to help us win." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers scored a game-high 24 points for Northridge (6-8), Kris 
Brodowski added 16 -- 14 in the second half -- and freshman Bill Mazurie (17 
points) made eight of nine free throws in the last 1:50 to help Northridge to 
its second victory in a row and third in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to forget about the statistics coming into this game," Mazurie 
said. "We knew we just had to forget about them and come out and play our game. 
This and the Fullerton game were our best efforts of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 77-70, with 1:27 left, Northridge made 11 of 12 free throws down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge took a 66-53 lead on Andre Henry's jump shot with 9:26 left, but the 
Mustangs went on an 8-0 run over the next 2:41 to cut the lead to five with 
6:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers and Kendell McDaniels countered with baskets for the Matadors to give 
them a 70-61 lead, but Kurt Colvin hit a basket and Shawn Reed followed with a 
three-point basket for the Mustangs to narrow the deficit to 70-66 with 4:12 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
That was as close as Cal Poly SLO would get. Brodowski hit a jump shot, and 
after Redd made one of two free throws, Mazurie was fouled by Cobby Naess on a 
layup and hit the free throw to give Northridge a 75-67 lead with 1:50 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Mustangs were forced to foul and Northridge responded with 
great free-throw shooting down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors led, 42-36, at halftime after perhaps playing their best 20 
minutes of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers scored 20 first-half points, making eight of 11 shots from the field 
and all three of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' final basket was a 12-foot bank shot with one second left in the half 
that gave the Matadors their six-point lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
With McDaniels and Percy Fisher picking up three fouls in the first half, 
Cassidy was forced to go to some of the leaner, quicker players on the bench -- 
and they responded with 16 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Scott, Mazurie and Fisher each scored four points, and Erik Cooper had 
two. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly SLO was led by Stuart Thomas, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound junior center, who 
scored nine points. Reserve forward Naess added eight.

GRAY DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Cal State Northridge football player Tommie Gray last month was 
due to natural causes, the Los Angeles County coroner's office disclosed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, 21, collapsed and died of a heart attack Dec. 15 while visiting with 
friends near the pool at University Park Apartments in Northridge. A spokesman 
for the coroner's office said that Gray died of conjunctive cardiomyopathy, the 
result of an enlarged heart. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's family has a history of heart disease. The player's father reportedly 
died of a heart attack at age 27. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Gray, of Modesto, started at nose tackle for the 
Matadors. MIKE HISERMAN

WALKER 4TH DESPITE FALL IN SHORT PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tisha Walker of the Conejo Valley Figure Skating Club moved into fourth place 
in the women's senior division of the Pacific Coast championships Friday night 
at the San Diego Ice Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was eighth going into Friday's short program, in which she fell on her 
opening jump. But the 16-year-old's marks for presentation were enough to move 
her into fourth, behind Holly Cook of Utah and Jeri Campbell and Karen Terry, 
both of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is two-tenths of a point out of third place.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

FRUSTRATED HART DROPS 4TH IN A ROW, 82-63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a starting lineup that includes no player over 6-foot-1, a pesky 
Alhambra High squad proved to be too much for Hart, whose starters average 
6-foot-4. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra handed Hart its fourth consecutive loss, 82-63, Friday night in a 
Foothill League boys' game at Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (11-6, 0-2) let its frustrations show as the Indians were called for five 
technicals. Micah Ohlman and Chad Hourigan were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Hung Duong led Alhambra with 24 points and Hon Trieu added 22 off the bench. 
Hart's Marty Downen scored 12. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra (14-2, 2-0) held a 34-25 advantage at the half, but blew the game open 
in the third quarter, outscoring Hart, 25-11. Alhambra led by as many as 28. 
</P>
<P>
The Moors scored the first 12 points of the second half before Hourigan hit a 
short jump shot with 4:39 to play in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Hart led, 18-15, with 6:12 left in the second quarter but Trieu hit three 
consecutive three-point baskets. The Moors never relinquished their lead. KIRBY

DAVE DISTEL: ROLL THE FILM! PADRES PICTURE BIG YEAR IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excuse me, but would it be gauche or even un-American to be talking baseball on 
the eve of the National Football League's conference championships? 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't be, not around here. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it has been seven years since the local football heroes were party 
to any activity in January. It is interesting to ponder how many Super Bowls 
will be played in San Diego before San Diego plays in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
This then leaves us to contemplate how many World Series the Padres might be in 
before the Chargers make it to a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
You see, I am ready for the baseball season to start. Spring training is little 
more than a month away, assuming something as stupid as a strike or a lockout 
does not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Padre highlight film, which made its debut Thursday night, did not 
stir memories as much as it did hope. What it was was a look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if this was a look back, Mark Davis would have made his first 
appearance long before what must have been the last reel. (Then again, maybe it 
was appropriate that Davis should appear near the end, since that was his modus 
operandi through what was a Cy Young season.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Davis' contribution are acknowledged and then Davis is dismissed, as 
in sayonara Cy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is gone, it seemed to be saying, but look at what's new pussycat . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter . . . and Craig Lefferts . . . and Fred Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Correct me if I am wrong, but Carter may be the best player the Padres have 
ever obtained in a trade. This is an impact player. Put Tony Gwynn third, 
Carter fourth and Jack Clark fifth, and you have a lineup with snap, crackle 
and a whole lot of pop. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack McKeon was asked who would be playing where, he identified Benito 
Santiago as the catcher, Clark as the first baseman, Roberto Alomar as the 
second baseman, Garry Templeton as the shortstop, Gwynn as the right fielder, 
Carter as the center fielder and a very versatile "I don't know" at both third 
base and left field. 
</P>
<P>
These observations came in a question-and-answer period. The film itself did 
not deal with such specifics, only with how wonderful everyone will be. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the film's stars should be the answer to McKeon's "I don't know." 
Bip Roberts was identified in the film as a utility player. In his case, this 
should mean that he is available to play whatever position no one else seems to 
be able to take. 
</P>
<P>
You know, Roberts plays third base if Fred Lynn plays left field, and Roberts 
plays left field if Mike Pagliarulo plays third base. That's called 
utilitarian, if not utility. 
</P>
<P>
One "place" Roberts has to play is leadoff. The film reminds us that he hit 
.301 and scored 81 runs in only 117 games last year. He wasn't under-utilized, 
but rather discovered a little too late. 
</P>
<P>
Another reminder . . . Alomar ended up hitting .295, sixth in the National 
League. Suddenly, the batting order is looking awfully good in the first 
through fifth spots. 
</P>
<P>
That gets us, finally, to the very first face to pop onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's the way of getting the message to everybody that this man is the 
Padre catcher. There's no more controversy, no more tug-a-war, over whether the 
Padres will deal Santiago or Sandy Alomar Jr. Goodby, Junior; Hello, Benny. 
</P>
<P>
When Santiago gets to Yuma, McKeon should sit him down and show him the film 
first thing. He will walk out of the room popping his buttons and maybe get 
through a whole season without whining or complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the film get me thinking the Padres are going to score a lot of 
runs, but it also left the impression that the other guys won't be scoring a 
lot of runs. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 staff, which returns virtually intact, may have gone unappreciated in 
the shadow of Mark Davis' 44 saves. After all, Ed Whitson and Bruce Hurst were 
fourth and fifth in the league in earned run average and had 31 victories 
between them. Eric Show was only around for 16 starts before he was injured, 
and Andy Benes was only around for 10 starts after being called up. Remember 
that Mark Grant was 8-2, and Greg Harris had a 2.60 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
What we have here is a solid starting rotation and a committee with no 
chairman, unless maybe it's Lefferts, to come out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
However, one thing I did not see in the film were many highlights from early in 
the season. Indeed, there have been very few early-season highlights for the 
Padres for the last couple of years. It is as if they start spring training in 
February and finish it sometime in June, whereupon they commence playing 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres' 1990 highlight film is going to be as good as the 1989 highlight 
film seems to suggest it will be, they might consider that games played in 
April and May do count. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, of course, we can entertain ourselves watching other cities' 
teams continue to play football. At least it will kill time until the real 
season is here . . . or the Chargers produce a highlight film longer than a 
station break.

AFTER TRAVERS SUPPLIES THE KICK, EL TORO SCORES 66-41 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To put it mildly, El Toro High School basketball Coach Tim Travers wasn't 
pleased with the Chargers' first-quarter play Friday night in a 66-41 victory 
over Mission Viejo at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
After watching his team fall behind, 14-13, and fail to get a shot off at the 
end of the quarter, Travers jumped off the bench, spun and kicked a folding 
chair into the scorer's table behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Knight would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just mad because we had blown an assignment on that last play," Travers 
said. "Maybe I got their attention with the chair. 
</P>
<P>
"My foot's still hurting from that. I thought I cut it, but I probably just 
wound up with a nice bruise. I learned that from my soccer coach back at Santa 
Monica High." 
</P>
<P>
It also taught his players something. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, ranked No. 2 in Orange County, outscored No. 9 Mission Viejo, 
21-5, in the second quarter. They led, 34-19, at halftime and Mission Viejo 
came no closer than 12 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's Rob Johnson, who scored a game-high 25 points, said his coach had 
reason to be upset after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He really went off," Johnson said. "He got in our faces after the quarter was 
over, but we responded." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson led the way, scoring seven points as El Toro opened the second quarter 
with a 15-1 streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes us a little while to get going," Johnson said. "We're always a 
little shaky in the first quarter. I don't know why. I guess it's just a bad 
habit we have to break." 
</P>
<P>
But El Toro did continue a good habit -- three-point shooting. Johnson made 
five of six three-pointers as the Chargers were 10 of 11 from three-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good shooting team," Johnson said. "We had something to prove after we 
played so bad (in a loss to Dana Hills) on Wednesday night." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the victory kept the Chargers in the South Coast League race. 
They improved to 14-3 overall and 2-1 in the league; Mission Viejo is 12-5 and 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just glad to see us bounce back," Travers said. "We got our lunch handed 
to us on Wednesday night, but we came back." 
</P>
<P>
Travers said he was pleased with El Toro's defense. The Chargers forced 12 
turnovers and the Diablos made only 17 of 55 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no excuses," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. "They were ready and 
we weren't. I have to give them a lot of credit on defense, but our offense was 
terrible too." 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Eric Cramer, Mission Viejo's leading scorer. El Toro's Greg Everett 
held Cramer to five points, 10 below his average. Greg Amaya led Mission Viejo 
with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Everett can do the job on defense," Travers said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everett shut down the lane," he said. 'Cramer was frustrated the whole game." 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
WESTERN RUNS, GUNS BUT STILL STRUGGLES TO DEFEAT SAVANNA 
</P>

<P>
Western High School created plenty of mayhem Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers played at the fast tempo they desired. It was very fast. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say the style was always successful. In fact, the Pioneers caused 
plenty of problems for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But Western did enough things right to defeat Savanna, 69-57, in an Orange 
League game at Savanna. The victory left the Pioneers in a first-place tie with 
Brea-Olinda, at least until Wednesday, when the two teams play. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Coach Greg Hoffman hopes his team will be a little more consistent by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of setting up a game plan and then see it wasted because we make 
mistakes," Hoffman said. "We haven't been able to sustain anything all year." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's point was well taken on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers played well at times, but also nearly blew leads of 13, 16, 15 and 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Western (11-4 overall, 3-0 in league play) started strong. The Pioneers pressed 
and ran and ran and pressed, which had the Rebels reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna committed four turnovers in the first two minutes and had difficulty 
getting into its offense. 
</P>
<P>
After three minutes, the Pioneers led, 12-3, and the Rebels had yet to make a 
shot from the field. The lead swelled to 36-20 late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, at times the Pioneers appeared to get ahead of themselves in trying to 
create the up-tempo pace. They had 13 turnovers in the first half and 22 for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Western appeared to things well in hand at halftime. The Pioneers led, 
37-23, thanks mostly to their 60% shooting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to put anybody away all season," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
True to form, the Pioneers gave the Rebels the opportunity to get back into the 
game. Trailing, 44-29, midway through the third quarter, Savanna went on a 16-6 
run to pull within, 50-45, going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Center Eric Preuss sparked the run as he scored all seven of his points in the 
third quarter. Ben Smith also scored seven points in the quarter and finished 
with a team-high 16. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Savanna credit," Hoffman said. "A lot of teams would have 
collapsed after getting behind by that many points early in the game. But they 
hung in there and kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Western, led by Sam Sabbara, opened a 59-47 lead. Sabbara, finished with 16 
points, scored nine in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels scored seven consecutive points to cut the deficit to five, 59-54. 
</P>
<P>
What saved the Pioneers was free throws. They made nine of 16 in the fourth 
quarter and 24 of 36 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Shelton was 15 of 21 from the foul line and finished with 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 52, Valencia 48 -- Keith Walker had 20 points and Rodney Stewart 
had 11 to lead Brea-Olinda (14-3, 2-0). Richard Tibbie had 18 points for 
Valencia (6-11, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 68, Magnolia 63 -- Guards Danny Castro and Greg Cole each had 20 points 
to lead host Anaheim (7-8, 1-1). Wayne Thomas had 18 points to lead Magnolia 
(5-9, 0-2).

SEA VIEW LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SEA KINGS STOP NO. 7 SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Corona del Mar High School's 41-35 Sea View League victory over Saddleback 
proved anything Friday night, it was that woeful, bumbling starts can be 
overcome -- no matter who you're playing. 
</P>
<P>
For host Corona del Mar (11-6 overall, 2-0 in league play), the upset over the 
county's seventh-ranked team seemed to come almost as a surprise. Saddleback 
(12-7, 1-1), the league's two-time defending champion, has not lost to Corona 
del Mar since 1987, and Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris admitted that negative 
thinking might have been creeping in to his team's mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
"You start second-guessing yourself, I think," Orris said. "You start wondering 
if you're ever going to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar need not wonder anymore. Although the Sea Kings played a 
skittish first half -- they often seemed a half-step behind -- they still 
managed a 19-18 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the third quarter didn't look much better. Both teams, plagued 
with turnovers, seemed out of sync offensively. But with 2:30 remaining, Corona 
del Mar found its groove, going on an 8-0 run that left Saddleback behind, 
31-24. 
</P>
<P>
Although Saddleback went to a full-court press in the fourth quarter, Corona 
del Mar remained poised. Saddleback missed seven of 11 free throws and did not 
score a field goal in the quarter until Andre McFarlane (11 points) hit a 
three-pointer with 11 seconds remaining to cut Corona del Mar's lead to 41-33. 
</P>
<P>
Orris praised his team's defensive effort -- it held Saddleback to 30% shooting 
from the field -- as well as the play of Jackson, who led all scorers with 19 
points, and Warren Johnson, who held Saddleback forward Jimmy Galbert to five 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren Johnson did a great job on Galbert," Orris said. "We weren't sure, 
matchup wise, who could guard him. I just challenged Warren to take him. 
Galbert tried to throw Warren around, but he just maintained his composure. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the best win we've had, but it's an important one." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, which moves into a first-place tie with Tustin, also had 10 
points from Jon Upham. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 86, University 62 -- Agustin Heredia scored 28 points to lead host 
Estancia (10-6, 1-1). Mike Haas added 19 and Paul McDaniels 16 for Estancia. 
Estancia led, 33-27, at the half and outscored University, 26-17, in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 65, Newport Harbor 58 -- Tustin trailed, 46-41, to start the fourth 
quarter but outscored host Newport Harbor, 24-12, in the final quarter. Robert 
Laubach led the way in the final quarter for Tustin, making 10 of 11 free 
throws. David Beilstein led Tustin (15-2, 2-0) with 18 points. Eddie Martinez 
scored 17 for Newport Harbor (11-6, 0-2).

ESPERANZA DEFENSE STIFLES CYPRESS IN TOP 10 MATCH 
</P>

By CHRIS FOSTER In other Empire League boys' matches: Los Alamitos 5, Loara 0

<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, the Esperanza High School boys' soccer team has had things 
pretty much its own way in the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had won five of the past six titles. 
</P>
<P>
This season was to be different, though. With two other teams ranked in the top 
10 of the Southern Section 2-A poll, the rest of the league appeared to be 
catching up with the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Well, things haven't changed all that much. Esperanza kept the tradition alive 
a little longer with a 1-0 victory over Cypress Friday at Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
It was a match that featured two of the top teams in the 2-A. Cypress was 
ranked third and Esperanza sixth. But, for the most part, there was only one 
dominant team on the field Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (11-2-3 overall, 3-0 in league play) controlled the match with their 
defense. They allowed the Centurions few opportunities around goal and kept the 
pressure on the Cypress side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids that to win the league this year, they were going to have to 
shut out some of the teams," Esperanza Coach Kino Oaxaca said. "They told me 
today that I would see them play a different kind of defense." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza smothered the Cypress attack for its third shutout of the season. The 
Centurions (11-2-3, 2-1) had only two shots on goal and rarely pushed the ball 
deep into Aztec territory in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Although Esperanza's defense is young and inexperienced, the group has matured 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs start two juniors, a sophomore and a senior on defense, none of whom 
were on the varsity last season. Yet, the team has allowed only 14 goals in 16 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has come along faster than I expected," Oaxaca said. "Since league 
began, they've become more aggressive and are working together better." 
</P>
<P>
The match was scoreless in the first half, although Esperanza had seven shots 
on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress goalie Ray Arvizu made two brilliant saves to keep the match tied. 
Early in the half, he dived to his left to block a shot by Trent Wise. A few 
minutes later, Arvizu tipped away Wise's header. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Voss broke the tie 12 minutes into the second half when he took a pass 
from Jason DeLucca and beat Arvizu to the right. The goal was Voss' 16th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The defense did the rest. The Centurions had five chances around the Aztec 
goal, but were turned away each time. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to win this game because we were at home," Oaxaca said. "We haven't 
lost here in almost two years. And who knows what will happen when we play 
Cypress at their house." 
</P>
<P>
But, for now, tradition has been maintained. CHRIS FOSTER In other Empire 
League boys' matches: Los Alamitos 5, Loara 0 -- Claudio Boggio had two goals 
for host Los Alamitos (6-5-5, 1-1-1). Ted Watson, Jay Willemese and John 
Sansour also scored. El Dorado 3, Katella 0 -- Todd Gibson, Derek Dean and 
Damien Tellez scored for visiting El Dorado (7-4-5, 1-2). In a Century League 
boys' match: Foothill 2, El Modena 0 -- Daren Jacobs scored both goals to lead 
visiting Foothill (15-2-1, 2-0). David Lough had 11 saves for El Modena, and 
Lance Anderson had seven saves for Foothill. In a Garden Grove League boys' 
match: La Quinta 0, Santiago 0 -- Praseuth Sotakoun had seven saves for La 
Quinta (7-6-4, 3-0-3). Santiago is 10-3-2, 5-0-1. In an Orange League boys' 
match: Valencia 4, Brea-Olinda 1 -- Mario Torrez had two goals and Uli Perez 
and Gary Thompson each had one for host Valencia. Marco Hernandez scored for 
Brea. In Pacific Coast League boys' matches: Laguna Hills 7, Costa Mesa 0 -- 
Juan Strutton had three goals (he scored five for the week) to lead visiting 
Laguna Hills (13-3, 6-1). Brian Slayback, Scott Clark, Jeff Cook and Chris 
Kannenberg also scored for Laguna Hills. Kirk Brown had his fourth shutout of 
the season and had five saves for Laguna Hills. Costa Mesa is 1-8, 0-7. Orange 
1, Woodbridge 0 -- Sal Anaya scored in the second half for host Orange (10-0-2, 
7-0). Freshman Jason Vlcek had two saves. Woodbridge is 2-4-1 in league. In Sea 
View League boys' matches: Corona del Mar 1, Saddleback 0 -- Chris Smith scored 
with 10 minutes remaining to play after the ball was deflected by the 
Saddleback goalkeeper to lead visiting Corona del Mar (8-8, 1-1). Chris 
Connelly had 11 saves for Corona del Mar. Estancia 2, University 0 -- Carlos 
Alcazar scored both goals in the second half to lead visiting Estancia (5-6-1, 
2-0). Will Bohuslaviski had 13 saves, eight in the first half for Estancia. 
University is 6-4-2, 0-1-1. Newport Harbor 1, Tustin 0 -- Todd Tift scored 15 
minutes into the second half to lift Newport Harbor (14-3-1, 2-0). Tim Wilson 
had 14 saves for Tustin (5-10, 0-1-1). In South Coast League boys' matches: 
Mission Viejo 2, El Toro 1 -- Frank Pace and Darren Wittenmeir scored for 
Mission Viejo (7-5-4, 1-1-1). Kevin Collins scored for El Toro. El Toro goalie 
Kevin Rowe had five saves, and Prespon Cubel had six for Mission Viejo. Irvine 
3, Capistrano Valley 1 -- Keith Rosenberg scored all three goals for visiting 
Irvine (3-5-3, 1-1-1). Capistrano Valley is 2-1 in league play. In Freeway 
League girls' matches: Sonora 2, Fullerton 1 -- Roz Schiefelbine and Lisa Knott 
scored for host Sonora (7-6-1, 1-1). Courtney Hunt scored for Fullerton (1-1). 
Sunny Hills 2, Troy 1 -- Leah Russell and Stacy Thurber scored for host Sunny 
Hills (10-1-2, 2-0). Kristan Foley scored for Troy (6-3-2, 1-1).

PHOTOGRAPHY: SHOOTING FOOTBALL: THE STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The football game has reached a critical juncture. The Rams are driving for 
what could be the winning field goal, and it's the photographer's job to 
outguess quarterback Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
All of us from the media who are photographing the event try to predict where 
the game action will occur and the best spot to capture the resultant 
jubilation. But, suddenly, Everett throws to Willie Anderson for the winning 
touchdown, and the Rams are in the National Football Conference championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
These are moments that make football a great game to photograph. They offer 
action and a chance to zero in on the sideline emotions. 
</P>
<P>
But being on target isn't the only consideration for great football 
photographs. We must also be in focus. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the factors we have no control over such as an official or 
player getting in our way or a player running from the bright sun into the 
shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation is the key in photographing football. We need the right clothing, 
equipment, stadium darkroom and credentials. 
</P>
<P>
In photographing the Rams in action, our first call is to the public relations 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Some people think there is some mythical all-serving press pass that gets us 
into a game. If we thought that, we'd be watching the game from the parking 
lot. Football teams issue separate credentials for each game. 
</P>
<P>
If the team is on the road, the next step is making the proper travel 
arrangements. For the Rams' recent game against the New York Giants, we 
contacted the Associated Press in New York and arranged to share their stadium 
darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
We also needed to make arrangements to have color negative film processed, two 
phone lines and a table for a transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
Flight plans included flying in on Saturday and out on Monday for the Sunday 
game. Although the game usually ends around 4 p.m., the processing and 
transmitting of photographs can keep us at the stadium until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Game day for photographers starts very early. There is usually a breakfast 
meeting to discuss the various shooting locations and game strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Film will be picked up by wire service runners at the end of each quarter and 
taken to the Associated Press darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
One of the staff photographers will leave the game at halftime and edit the 
film and start transmitting, which usually leaves just two photographers to 
shoot the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers arrive at the game about two hours before kickoff to set up and 
locate the wire service darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
Photographers from USA Today, the Washington Times, the Orange County Register 
and Los Angeles Daily News use this facility too. 
</P>
<P>
There is usually a check to see that the Leafax transmitter is working. This 
machine transmits from a negative, either color or black-and-white, into a 
positive form over the phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the biggest changes in wire-photo technology in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days of making prints. We simply put the negative in the machine 
and the image pops up on a small television screen. Then we crop the 
photograph, write a caption, change the contrast and send it. 
</P>
<P>
Each image takes eight minutes to send in black and white or about 30 minutes 
in color because three color separations are sent of the image. 
</P>
<P>
The film used during the game is Kodak Ektapress 400 in the first half and 1600 
in the second half. The shadows on the field during the first half make it 
difficult to shoot. The faster 1600 ISO (ASA) film is needed in the second half 
because the entire field is in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is another factor beyond our control. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rams' last playoff game against the Giants, the temperature was in the 
low 40s, which is pleasant for football if you're dressed properly. 
</P>
<P>
But when we pack for a trip, we have to be prepared for any situation or change 
in the weather. 
</P>
<P>
It's wise to have two pairs of gloves, one that is thin or a liner style that 
will keep hands warm but allow us to unload the camera and change the film. An 
additional heavier pair is needed to go over lighter gloves if it gets really 
cold. There are also gloves with the fingers cut out so we can keep them on and 
still handle the film. 
</P>
<P>
A warm waterproof jacket and pants are essential, otherwise if the field is a 
little damp and we kneel, the freezing water will soak right through. 
</P>
<P>
Warm socks and high-quality boots are also important. They are our first 
protection from an ice-cold field and weather that will get colder as the game 
progresses. The sun will be gone, leaving the field completely in shadow. 
Although this makes it easier to shoot because the field and players are evenly 
lit, the cold is uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Rain can be a major problem. Not only do we struggle to keep warm, but we have 
to keep our camera gear dry. Today's camera depends so much on electronic 
circuitry it doesn't fare well when wet. 
</P>
<P>
We can affix an umbrella to our monopods with clamps and tape plastic bags to 
the lenses. This is awkward, but we don't have many options. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nice aspects about inclement weather and football is the look it 
gives the images. Muddy exhausted football players slugging it out or battling 
through a thick blanket of white snow are good pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The two words you fear most are windchill factor. Then it's best to stay 
inside.

<P>
Taking a look into tomorrowland, Walt Disney Co. said Friday it hopes to build 
a new $1-billion theme park in Southern California in the next decade and 
reinvigorate 35-year-old Disneyland with dozens of new attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new park will pit Anaheim and Long Beach against each other in a 
high-stakes game to become the Southland's premier tourist stop. But Disney 
officials warned that without government assistance to solve traffic problems, 
a new park would remain a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements at Disneyland, the nation's second most popular amusement park 
after Walt Disney World in Florida, will begin immediately and be phased in 
over the next 10 years. Company officials have described the costly expansion 
and remodeling as the largest in the park's 35-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the '90s -- the decade we reinvent the Disney experience not just in 
California, but worldwide," said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief 
executive, at a press conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner said the company's 10-year plan calls for the addition at the Magic 
Kingdom of a slew of rides based on hit movies -- including "The Little 
Mermaid," the "Indiana Jones" series, and the upcoming "Dick Tracy," giving 
Disneyland a glitzier, Hollywood flavor. 
</P>
<P>
He also detailed plans to add two new theme areas -- Mickey's Starland and 
Hollywoodland, a major new area of Disneyland that will be a fantasy 
re-creation of Hollywood Boulevard. The Tomorrowland section of the park also 
will be completely redone. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has been considering construction of a second amusement park in Southern 
California for at least four years. Eisner said Disney wants to build the new 
park in Anaheim near Disneyland or in Long Beach. But the project is contingent 
on government cooperation to resolve traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are enormous with the infrastructure -- in terms of traffic 
systems, exit roads, parking, the needed amount of land," Eisner said. "Without 
the interest of citizens, the city council and the mayor (of either city), it 
will never happen." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the press conference, Eisner said there would have to be 
some kind of governmental financial support "in things like infrastructure." He 
noted that in France and Florida the company has been able to win concessions 
on issues ranging from zoning to widening roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't build highways," Eisner said. "Unless we have a partnership," the 
project won't be built. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Anaheim or Long Beach wins the new attraction "depends a lot on which 
one wants us more," Eisner said. He estimated the cost of the new park could be 
well over $1 billion and said the company hopes to begin developing it by the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, a second park could be added on 40 acres already owned by the 
company near Disneyland. There are another 30 undeveloped acres within 
Disneyland in the so-called "backstage" areas. Eisner also said current parking 
lots might be used, if alternative parking space could be found. 
</P>
<P>
"Or we could use a combination of those areas," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter enthusiastically endorsed the proposal for a second 
theme park, and city officials there say they are prepared to arrange off-site 
parking and transportation to a new facility if that's what it would take to 
win the new park. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, meanwhile, Disney Co. officials met Thursday with city 
officials, showing them drawings and slides of a nautical-theme park. Disney 
now leases 55 acres -- where the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose attractions are 
located -- and has an option to develop another 256 acres, now mostly under 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"It would obviously be ocean-oriented and an educational type attraction with a 
nautical and water theme," said Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell. "We're excited 
about the possibility, as long as the traffic and financial implications are 
attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eisner was cautious in emphasizing that the second theme park is 
desirable from the company's standpoint but far from definite. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we can solve the problems in California, the state as a Disney 
destination is going to become less important as Florida becomes more 
important," he said, referring to Disney's hugely successful 30,000-acre Walt 
Disney World in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, almost two years ago, Disney scuttled plans to build a $611-million 
theme park and shopping mall in downtown Burbank -- after 15 years and endless 
discussions with city officials there -- when it determined estimated revenue 
would not support the project. 
</P>
<P>
Far more definite than a second Southland theme park are the company's plans to 
spruce up and expand Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Eisner said, the Muppets will invade Disneyland with a Muppets stage 
show. The park also will add a Young Indiana Jones ride, similar to one in 
Florida in which the movie hero survives flipped jeeps, flash fires and rolling 
boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, in 1993, Mickey's Starland is scheduled to open, coinciding 
with the corporate mascot's 65th birthday. The new theme area will feature a 
birthday party show, a chance for customers to shake Mickey's hand, plus a 
Muppet Movie in "Muppetvision 3-D." A "Little Mermaid" attraction based on the 
hit film also will be added. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrowland -- with its outdated Mission to Mars ride -- will be completely 
refurbished in 1994. While turnstiles will continue to click at the most 
popular attractions -- Star Tours and Space Mountain -- new rides will include 
two outer-space rides -- an alien encounter and Plectu's Fantastic Galactic 
Review. A new, 3-D movie by film maker George Lucas, creator of the park's 
Captain Eo ride, will be added, and an entire second story will be built, so 
that skywalks will crisscross all of Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
An attraction based on the Dick Tracy movie will be added in 1996, giving park 
patrons the chance to chase crooks through city streets in racing police 
sedans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most elaborate changes will happen in early 1999, with Disneyland 
adding Hollywoodland -- complete with a white-lettered sign -- with four new 
attractions: a Toon Town ride and Oversized Baby Buggy ride, both of which have 
patrons careening through scenes from the hit movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Two rides planned for the new Hollywoodland are borrowed from Walt Disney 
World: the Great Movie Ride, which lets customers travel through re-creations 
of movie classics, and Superstar TV, in which selected patrons will be able to 
appear in classic episodes of "I Love Lucy" or the Johnny Carson show. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner, who joined Disney six years ago, declined to reveal the costs of the 
additions, other than to say he hoped they would be financed by Disney's 
earnings and that each attraction must meet its company-required return on 
investment. 
</P>
<P>

ANAHEIM, LONG BEACH FLEX MUSCLES IN EARLY BIDDING

<P>
The announcement that the Walt Disney Co. plans to build a new $1-billion theme 
park in either Anaheim or Long Beach is bound to spark a bidding war between 
the two cities, both eager to snag the added income and employment the park 
would bring. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Anaheim believe they have a strong advantage -- an abundance of 
hotel rooms, a large convention center and the lure of Disney's first and 
best-known amusement park, Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities in Long Beach believe they can offer three attractive features 
that Anaheim cannot -- a prime oceanfront location, a larger site and 
less-congested freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high: Disneyland is the centerpiece of tourist attractions that 
brought Anaheim about $15.5 million in sales tax revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I have the first opportunity before Long Beach to say the answer is, 
'Yes, yes, yes,' " Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said immediately after the 
announcement by Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor of Anaheim can say, 'Yes, yes, yes' to Disney, but he can't say, 
'Yes, yes, yes' to an open checkbook," Long Beach Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton 
countered in an interview later, pointing out that neither city has been told 
precisely how much the project would cost each municipality. 
</P>
<P>
The new park will be built either on about 66 acres next to Disneyland, or on 
55 acres of land and 256 acres of water around the Queen Mary in Long Beach 
that the Disney Co. has the right to develop, Eisner said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials, who were kept in the dark about plans for a new park, were 
stunned by Friday's announcement. But officials immediately endorsed the idea 
and started making promises. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim is ready to cut any deal we'll have to," declared Anaheim City 
Councilman Irv Pickler. "If we haven't given that message to Disneyland, we're 
going to give it to Disneyland real soon." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, a Disney executive made a presentation to city officials on 
Thursday about plans for a nautical-theme park next to the Queen Mary-Spruce 
Goose attraction, which Disney bought from the Wrather Corp. in 1988. Disney 
has been discussing the possibility of such a park in Long Beach for more than 
a year, so Friday's announcement was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials said they have considered an ocean landfill, tax 
exemptions and parking garages to attract Disney. But they are moving with 
caution, vowing to study the park's impact on the city's economy, traffic flow, 
parking shortage and quality of life before deciding how much they would spend 
to bring the amusement park giant to town. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow ourselves to do something foolish because of what may or may 
not be some competitive bidding," Councilman Ernie Kell said. "It has got to be 
a plus for us as well as Disneyland. If we end up with more traffic and more 
smog -- those days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Eisner described the new park as "in development" and would say only that the 
facility would open in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The new park will be built in the city that demonstrates the best plan for 
handling the traffic and parking problems the massive attraction will generate, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends a lot on which community wants us more," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the congested Disneyland area already has problems with traffic 
and circulation. "Long Beach has a little less of a problem" because the Long 
Beach Freeway that ends at the Queen Mary area is one of the least-used 
freeways in the Los Angeles area, Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Assistant City Manager James Ruth said his city is studying how to 
improve traffic in the Disneyland area, and will expand the study to include 
strategies for handling a new theme park. Anaheim is prepared to provide 
off-site transportation and parking for the new attraction, Ruth said, noting 
that the city is experienced in handling traffic jams from both Disneyland and 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to take risks," Ruth said. "We do want it. We want it badly." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officials believe their trump card is the ocean. Councilman Evan 
Anderson Braude said the ambience of a seaside attraction and superior freeway 
access will be in his city's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"For something new and exciting, they're better off here," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
But while Long Beach may have a transportation and ocean-side advantage, the 
city is far less prepared to handle the millions of tourists who would visit 
the park. Long Beach has just 4,400 hotel and motel rooms, compared to about 
16,000 in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Convention Center, which drew more than 1 million conventioneers 
last year, is about nine times larger than the Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of building theme parks next door to each other might seem 
odd, the Disney Co. has had great success with the concept in Orlando, Fla., 
where Walt Disney World, the Epcot Center, Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park and a 
water theme park are part of the same complex. 
</P>
<P>
A new park "would make Anaheim even more of a destination city," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also extolled the virtues of a nautical-theme park in Long Beach, 
saying, "We believe this area could be developed into a Southern California 
attraction and are considering plans to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Councilman Les Robbins said the Disney Co. already has invested 
"millions" in plans for a Long Beach park. "They have enough invested in this 
Long Beach project that they're not going to walk away," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from both cities observed that it was shrewd of the Disney Co. to pit 
them against each other for the company's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's business, man," Robbins said. "May the best city win." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Roxana Kopetman and Faye Fiore contributed to this story 
from Long Beach.

5 SOUTHLAND PLANTS LISTED BY EPA AS EMITTING CANCER-CAUSING POLLUTANTS; 
</P>
<P>
TOXINS: REVISED REPORT LOWERS ESTIMATED RISK TO NEIGHBORS OF SANTA ANA'S 
CAL-COMPACK FOODS INC. FROM ESTIMATED 1 IN 1,000 PEOPLE TO 1 IN 10,000.

<P>
About 180 industrial plants in 34 states, including one in Orange County, are 
spewing toxic pollutants that increase nearby residents' chances of developing 
cancer far in excess of levels considered acceptable by the government, new 
Environmental Protection Agency figures show. 
</P>
<P>
But the findings generally are more reassuring than those contained in a 
similar report seven months ago. The reasons include fresher data, refined 
calculations and actual reductions in emissions at some plants, said EPA 
Director William K. Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 205 plants across the country were on the EPA list. But the EPA has 
revised downward the cancer risks for residents near 139 of the plants, while 
assigning higher estimates to 42 plants. (One plant rating was unchanged; the 
others have closed or merged.) 
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA report, residents near Cal-Compack Foods Inc. in Santa Ana 
face a 1-in-10,000 chance of developing cancer because the plant uses ethylene 
oxide, a chemical for sterilizing equipment used to process food ingredients. 
Cal-Compack, located in the 4900 block of West 1st Street, makes chili powder. 
</P>
<P>
EPA data released last summer that said residents near the plant faced a 
1-in-1,000 chance of developing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to see the (new) report, so we really can't comment on 
it," said Kay Carpenter, manager of corporate communications for 
Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson, which owns Cal-Compack. "I do know that the statistics in 
the last report were old statistics. We installed an incinerator that now 
filters out virtually 99% of the emittants that go into the air." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most dramatic downward revisions of cancer risks involved Unocal 
Corp.'s chemical plant in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the EPA estimated that the lifetime cancer risk to a resident near 
Unocal's plant could be greater than 1 in 100. The new figures put the risk at 
1 in 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a comparison, one in three Americans on average will develop cancer in his 
or her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the EPA has downgraded its estimate of a cancer risk at 
and around our plant," Arthur Bentley, a Unocal spokesman, said Friday. "We 
have always operated the plant in accordance with all laws and regulations and 
with the highest regard for the safety of employees and neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
David Carroll, director of environmental programs at the Chemical Manufacturers 
Assn. in Washington, added: "The calculations really confirm what we've been 
saying since June -- there is a continuing downward trend in releases (of 
pollutants)." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said in a letter this week to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who 
released the EPA data, that the estimates are intended only to help officials 
compare and rank sources of pollutants across the country -- not to serve as 
guides on health risks. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the data is 
significant," Reilly warned. "At no time did EPA ever intend this data to be 
used to estimate an individual's cancer risk." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Waxman said, the overall data suggest that industries throughout 
the country are able to release significant amounts of cancer-causing chemicals 
without violating any environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some reduction in risk," he said. "But the basic message 
remains the same -- far too many plants are posing serious health risks to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates that about 2.7 billion pounds of more than 275 different 
toxic chemicals are emitted annually. While federal agencies recognize more 
than 100 chemicals released as potentially hazardous, current EPA regulations 
impose emission ceilings on less than 10% of them. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unregulated carcinogenic emissions are butadiene, produced by rubber 
manufacturers; chloroform, a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry; ethylene 
oxide, a sterilizing agent, and carbon tetrachloride and methylene chloride, 
industrial solvents. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluating harmful chemicals, EPA generally considers a cancer risk higher 
than 1 in 1 million as unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer-risk estimates are based on an assumption that a person lives his 
entire life at the edge of a plant and within 200 meters from the point of 
emission, according to James Weigold, deputy director of the emissions 
standards division of EPA's office of air programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing for anybody to become alarmed about, but it's something to be 
concerned about," he said in a telephone interview from his Durham, N.C., 
office. "Remember, this is long-term exposure we're talking about. Not Bhopal 
(India)." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as before, residents near the Texaco plant in Fort Neches, Tex., were 
assigned a 1-in-10 chance of developing cancer as a result of exposure to 
emissions of butadiene. No other plant was in this category. "That's 100,000 
times higher than EPA's goal," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
Six plants were in the 1-in-100 risk category, mostly in Texas as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON EPA's LIST 
</P>
<P>
These are California industrial plants identified by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency as among those releasing toxic chemicals that increase the 
lifetime risk of developing cancer by people who live nearby:

INVASION OF THE SPACE TOMATOES; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: IRVINE STUDENTS CHEER WHEN THEY LEARN THAT SOME SEEDS FROM A RETRIEVED 
SATELLITE WILL BE COMING TO THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
IRVINE -- Inside Nancy Atlee's classroom at Turtle Rock Elementary School on 
Friday, dozens of students sat riveted to a television news broadcast on the 
space shuttle Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
To many of these fourth- and fifth-graders, the high-tech drama of Columbia's 
rescue of an old science satellite -- dubbed an LDEF for Long Duration Exposure 
Facility -- took on an added dimension when they learned that they and other 
schoolchildren across the country may soon be getting a part of the LDEF'S 
cargo. 
</P>
<P>
Science teacher Robin Van Vorhis said it may change the students' taste for, or 
at least their opinions of, the tomato plant. 
</P>
<P>
"When NASA first put the satellite into orbit in 1984, they put 50 pounds of 
tomato seeds on board as part of an experiment on weightlessness and gravity," 
Van Vorhis explained. 
</P>
<P>
When she told students that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
plans to send some of these space seeds to their school to grow as experiments, 
Preston Kuo, 11, and other students screamed in unison, "Cool." 
</P>
<P>
"My dad is interested in the space program," Preston said, "He watches TV a 
lot. I think these tomato seeds might grow differently because they've been in 
space and, like, have vines going off in different directions." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," said Ruth Murray, 10. "I think it might grow a little 
faster or not at all, or maybe deformed." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Overdevest, 11, disagreed. "They're going to be strange, like purple or 
something. Or white." 
</P>
<P>
Although this is the generation of video telephones and robot toys, the idea of 
eating space tomatoes was, well, uncool, according to student Kevin Groh. 
</P>
<P>
"Yuck! They're probably going to taste tart, like stale yogurt or something." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, science specialists in the Irvine Unified School District 
notified NASA, which had queried various schools in the country, that they 
would like to participate in the seed project, Vincent Sipkovich, a science 
teacher, said. 
</P>
<P>
The LDEF was launched in April, 1984, from the shuttle Challenger to document 
the wear and tear of space travel on what was supposed to be a 10-month flight. 
But a series of delays, including the Challenger explosion in 1986, forced the 
recovery on Friday, which averted the satellite's fiery plunge to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"NASA told us that although the space shuttle retrieved the satellite today 
(Friday), we probably won't be receiving the seeds for another month," 
Sipkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to have the district's 15 science specialists plant the 
well-traveled tomato seeds side-by-side with normal seeds as part of an 
experiment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we can check to see if their growth differs from regular normal seeds," 
Sipkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the space seeds survived was not known Friday. The LDEF had faced deep 
space during its 32,422-orbit, 854-million-mile journey. Hit by space debris, 
the covers on at least two of satellite's 57 experiments were "flapping in the 
breeze," NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the rendezvous between the satellite and Columbia, which required a 
series of rocket firings over three days to align the space shuttle with the 
LDEF, "went famously," said flight director Granvil Pennington. "It looks like 
we've got an important piece of science in our grasp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the students at Turtle Rock, at least one said he was eager to get his 
hands on a piece of the space program. 
</P>
<P>
"But maybe I'll put gloves on . . . just in case," said young Overdevest.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSAL WOULD CUT APARTMENT DENSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overcrowding in Santa Ana could be reduced by amending the city's general plan 
to curb construction of high-density apartment projects, according to city 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed amendment, already approved by the Planning Commission, would slice 
the number of apartment units from 35 to 15 per acre in the city's downtown and 
Civic Center areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other sections of the city are already limited to seven units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the amendment at its 
next meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A staff report to the City Council said that overcrowding in Santa Ana has been 
caused by housing developments with large numbers of units. The high-density 
projects lead to "on-street parking and circulation problems, increased demand 
for emergency services and rapid deterioration of these properties due to 
overcrowding and inadequate maintenance," the staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the amendment would affect 19 housing projects that are in various 
stages of city approval. Six of the projects, which already have been approved, 
would be allowed under a grandfather clause. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Planning Commission approved the proposed amendment 5 to 0, 
with two commissioners absent. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago the city had adopted an amendment cutting the allowable 
apartment density from 90 units to 35 in all neighborhoods except those 
designated as development areas. 
</P>
<P>
Several neighborhood associations have been pushing for limitations on 
high-density apartment buildings, particularly those in higher crime areas. In 
1986, the East Side Assn., which is made up of about 100 residents, 
successfully persuaded the city to reduce the apartment density in its section 
of town after a number of apartment complexes were built there and the crime 
rate increased. LILY ENG

DO-OR-DIE RAMS FANS BACK TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Adair remembers going to San Francisco several times over the past two 
decades to watch the Rams play the 49ers, but the experience wasn't always 
pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
"When we would win, we would have to take off our (Rams) hats because they 
would be so rabid," said Adair, 73, who has held Rams season tickets since the 
team came to Southern California in 1946 and moved to Anaheim in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Adair and his wife, Ruth, will still be in danger of being targeted 
by irate 49er fans. The only tickets he could get are in the 49ers' section, 
and he doesn't plan to disguise his loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
He and other die-hard Rams fans will trek to Candlestick Park wearing the Rams 
colors and blowing the Rams horns. 
</P>
<P>
Adair, like other members of the Rams Booster Club, is confident that the team, 
often the underdog, will come through this time as they face the 49ers for the 
National Football Conference championship. He is among 30 club members who will 
fly to San Francisco this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I get so disappointed when I had to see someone else go to the 
Super Bowl," he said. "I never lost faith. I've never failed to attend their 
games. I got distressed, but we still went." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Ann Faria, who has held a season ticket for 18 years, is even more 
confident that the long wait will at last be over. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the finals, do or die!" she said. "I'm so excited, I can't even think. 
. . . It's awesome. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone makes fun of the Rams," she said, but "it's deja vu time. We're going 
to New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
Faria was among those booster club members who traveled to New Jersey last 
weekend to watch the Rams beat the New York Giants, 19-13. Ever the enthusiast, 
Faria said that game was at times a harrowing experience. 
</P>
<P>
One Giants fan, she said, took off an article of clothing each time the Rams 
scored. "By the end of the game he was naked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Faria doesn't expect fans to be quite so extreme, but there 
still could be problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-niner fans are vicious," she said. "It's just us and 50,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Adair recalled the early days of the Rams, when they played in the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. He was there in 1946 when the Rams played their first game after 
moving from Cleveland. He has been a season ticket-holder ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Adair was among those who went to the Super Bowl in 1980, when the Rams lost to 
the Pittsburgh Steelers. But his seats were in the upper reaches of the 
stadium, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. "It was a high disappointment because we 
were the No. 2 team." 
</P>
<P>
For Faria, who bought a $350 scalped ticket for the game, the Rams' Super Bowl 
loss to the Steelers was heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
"We were having the best time until Terry Bradshaw connected with Lynn Swann," 
she said. "I cried and cried for two or three days." 
</P>
<P>
Faria predicts that it will be different this year. She attended a practice 
before the Giants game last week. 
</P>
<P>
"They were so fluid," she said. "They all played so well. You know the 
difference. Everyone on the sidelines knows. You just know. You got the sixth 
sense, like a mother always knowing if her kids are doing anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime fans are making tentative accommodation plans in New Orleans, even 
talking with 49ers booster club members about taking their hotel rooms or 
airline tickets. Both Faria and Adair plan to go, even though the total cost 
could exceed $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go this far, how can you not go all the way?" Faria asked. 
</P>
<P>
One 22-year Rams season ticket-holder won't be in San Francisco for Sunday's 
game. He will be at home, rooting for the 49ers. D.H. (Doc) Needham, who sells 
real estate from Thousand Oaks, held season tickets from 1959 to 1981, when he 
started rooting for San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Needham, 67, switched his allegiance because he was upset by the way the Rams 
team was being run and by the owners, particularly Georgia Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
"She just started ripping the team apart by getting rid of some players," he 
said. He said he would stay with the 49ers "as long as she owns the team and 
runs it the way she does." 
</P>
<P>
He picks the 49ers on Sunday by 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
For many Rams loyalists, thoughts in the past few days have been almost solely 
on Sunday's game. Adair, owner of a chain of furniture stores in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, said that he has talked about it quite a bit with his 
employees at work. 
</P>
<P>
"They know I'm going," he said, "and they know they'd better root for the 
Rams." TED JOHNSON

City residents can begin paying $2 to register their vehicles in a voluntary 
theft-prevention program administered by the San Clemente Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Combat Auto Theft program, founded in New York City in 1986 and begun 
Friday in San Clemente, enrolled residents will receive a yellow window decal 
indicating that they do not normally drive between 1 and 5 a.m. If a tagged 
vehicle is spotted during these hours, police are authorized to stop it as a 
suspected theft. 
</P>
<P>
According to police records, vehicle thefts in the city limits totaled 251 in 
1989, and 237 in 1988. Most thefts occurred in the central area of the city, 
records show. This is the first year San Clemente has used the program, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Registration is by appointment only. Those registering are required to bring a 
valid driver's license, the vehicle registration, the vehicle to be enrolled 
and documentation of a San Clemente address. The Police Department is at 100 
Avenida Presidio and can be reached at (714) 361-8213 or (714) 361-8386. WENDY

PLANTING PLAN WOULD ADD 200,000 TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members are preparing to launch a long-range landscaping program 
for the city that some officials predict will result in planting close to 
200,000 trees within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which officials expect to be presented at the council's next meeting, 
calls for the city and its residents to cooperate on a tree-planting program on 
private property as well as in parks and open-space areas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important thing for people and cities to do," said City Councilman 
Cameron Cosgrove, who is drafting the planting plan. "As citizens, we all enjoy 
the benefits of modern technology such as our automobiles. But they produce 
carbon monoxide, which is a poison, and trees are the most effective natural 
means of cleaning out that poison." 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Cosgrove said, the city would buy 500 to 1,000 tree seedlings a 
year and plant them in open-space areas. Larger trees would be planted in parks 
and in strips of right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Also, residents would be encouraged to plant trees on their properties as part 
of a related "Neighbor Woods" project. The city, Cosgrove said, will try to 
work with area nurseries to let residents buy seedling trees at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
Another program would involve replacing landscaping shrubbery that demands 
heavy watering or requires large amounts of fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove and others say the landscaping and planting proposals would be 
inexpensive -- seedlings, for instance, sell for about 50 cents each, so the 
city could buy a year's crop for about $500. Volunteers would be sought to help 
with the planting, Cosgrove said. 
</P>
<P>
With little city money required to kick off the program, the proposals appear 
to enjoy broad support on the council. Mayor Larry Agran backs the program, as 
does Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who often differs with the mayor on 
policy questions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an apple pie and motherhood issue," Sheridan said Thursday. "Is anyone 
against planting trees? No." JIM NEWTON

The city school district will need additional classrooms to handle growing 
enrollment by September, according to a report to the school board this week. 
</P>
<P>
New portable classrooms may be needed at El Cerrito, Las Positas, Sierra Vista, 
Imperial and Washington schools, the report said. Replacement buildings may 
also be installed at Las Lomas Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. Rich Hermann was directed to investigate alternate methods for 
funding a purchase of new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district has a special reserve fund containing $1.3 million, board 
members are reluctant to draw money needed for new portables from that source, 
board members said. DAVID F. BURKE

BAYSIDE DRIVE SEWER LINE WORK TO BEGIN

<P>
A contractor was selected this week for the Bayside Drive phases of a sewer 
line project to serve planned homes on Newport Coast, the unincorporated Irvine 
Co. land between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McGrand &amp; Associates of Calimesa, Calif., was awarded the $2-million 
contract for the installation of sewer lines along scenic Bayside Drive from 
Coast Highway in Newport Beach to Marguerite Avenue in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Work will begin in about six weeks, said Corinne Clawson, County Sanitation 
Districts spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase of the project, to be installed through the Corona del Mar 
business district on East Coast Highway to the south city limits, will be under 
construction after Pelican Hill Road is completed next year, according to a 
resolution passed earlier that prohibits downtown upheaval before the bypass 
road is in place, said Councilman Phil Sansone. 
</P>
<P>
Sansone said sections of Bayside Drive, a popular alternate route for 
commuters, will be restricted or closed during the construction. Traffic is 
expected to worsen on Coast Highway until summer when construction is scheduled 
for completion. LESLIE HERZOG

Mayor Carrey J. Nelson has announced "Spotlight on Youth" as the city's theme 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for young people," Nelson said. "We 
need to acknowledge the diversity of their achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who has seven children and nine grandchildren, said the city will be 
recognizing youths for their uniqueness at each council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of each session, the lights will be dimmed and a spotlight 
will shine on the week's recipient, he said. JENNIFER MOULTON

MAN SOUGHT IN AUTO SHOP SHOOTINGS SURRENDERS

The brother of an auto shop owner killed by a disgruntled employee surrendered 
to police for questioning Friday, two days after he fatally shot his brother's 
murderer and fled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Alonso Romero, 22, the brother of slain shop owner Alfonso Alonso Romero, 
had been sought for questioning since Wednesday when he shot the employee 
shortly after the man killed his brother. He was released after questioning and 
is not expected to be charged, said Police Lt. Earl Porter. 
</P>
<P>
The disgruntled worker was identified Friday by police as Roberto Diaz Valle, 
24, of Santa Ana. Valle pulled a 9-millimeter pistol and gunned down Alfonso 
Romero, 30, and a bystander, Victoriano Salgado Delgado, 29, after Romero fired 
him from his job as a mechanic at El Gato Repair Shop at 1706 W. 1st St. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Romero's wife, Elia Padilla, 18, was also shot and critically wounded 
by Valle, who police said also went by the name of Alejandro Salazar. Padilla, 
who was shot twice in the shoulder and side, was released Friday from Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Juan Romero rushed to his brother's shop from a neighboring garage 
when the shots rang out. He allegedly spotted a handgun tucked in Delgado's 
waistband, grabbed it and fired, hitting Valle in the head. Romero then 
allegedly jumped into a 1981 yellow Toyota pickup truck and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Romero's partner, Roberto Medina, said Friday that Delgado returned to 
the shop with a gun after arguing with Valle earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Porter declined to say whether Juan Romero explained why he fled, and would not 
release any further details about his hourlong conversation with police, citing 
Romero's status as a material witness to a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Porter also said Juan Romero suffered a slight gunshot wound in the shooting, 
but added that he had no details on how and when Romero was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements for Alfonso Romero were pending Friday.

ROOS' BILL WOULD DEPORT ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hoping to take an Orange County program statewide, Assemblyman Mike Roos 
announced Friday that he will introduce a bill designed to guarantee the 
deportation of illegal aliens who commit serious crimes in California. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, a Los Angeles Democrat, said he got the idea from Orange County Superior 
Court Judge David O. Carter, who began screening illegal alien defendants in 
his Santa Ana courtroom a year ago. Carter's program is believed to be the only 
one of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
If the bill is approved, Immigration and Naturalization Service agents would 
fan out into California courts and determine the citizenship status of those 
accused of so-called aggravated felonies, such as murder, robbery, drug-dealing 
and other serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants who are in this country illegally would be tracked as they move 
through the justice system, Roos said. Once they are convicted, a judge could 
choose to waive sentence and turn them over to the INS for deportation, or 
sentence them to jail and have the INS deport them afterward, Roos said. Those 
re-entering the country would be subject to enhanced penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Roos, Carter and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Byrne discussed the 
proposal at a news conference in MacArthur Park, a notorious hangout for drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Roos' bill is intended to remedy the lack of coordination between 
state and federal authorities, which he said results in the release of many 
illegal alien convicts back onto the streets of California after they serve 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Medellin and Cali cartels can cooperate to get 19 tons of cocaine into 
a warehouse in Sylmar, the state and federal governments can cooperate to get 
illegal aliens who commit crimes out of the country," Carter said, referring to 
last year's discovery of a huge cache of drugs in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nativo Lopez, spokesman for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, a Santa Ana advocacy 
group for undocumented workers, agreed that illegal immigrants who commit 
serious crimes should be deported, but he expressed fear that the program could 
lead to harassment of non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it's aggravated felonies. What will it be tomorrow, driving under the 
influence of alcohol? It expands the power of the judiciary to persecute these 
people even more," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, assistant presiding judge of Orange County Superior Court's criminal 
division, has pushed for nationwide legislation to implement his idea. Last 
November, he pitched the program to a subcommittee of the House Judiciary 
Committee and to federal drug czar William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said he believes the INS should redirect its current efforts to focus on 
those who are "the scourge of our society." The INS should cut back on raids of 
"fields, sweatshops and garment businesses," whose workers are "trying to make 
something of themselves," and concentrate on illegal aliens who have committed 
serious crimes, Roos suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS's western regional office in Laguna 
Niguel, said the identification and deportation of criminal aliens has always 
been a "top priority" for the agency. But any change in the enforcement targets 
of the INS in California would be impossible without a national policy 
directive from Washington, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Carter estimates that at least 40% of the people arrested for felonies who pass 
through his court are illegal aliens. In the first nine months of 1989, 685 of 
the 1,880 felons brought before him were here illegally from 17 other 
countries, he said. INS is now tracking all 685, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said a recent INS study of crimes in the Los Angeles Police Department's 
tough Rampart Division near downtown showed that 80% of those arrested on 
drug-related crimes and 70% of the total number of arrestees were illegal 
aliens. About 120,000 prison inmates nationwide are deportable because of their 
criminal convictions, he said.

COSTA MESA MAYOR SUGGESTS COMMERCIAL SITE FOR SOS

<P>
Mayor Peter F. Buffa on Friday proposed that the Share Our Selves charity, soon 
to be ousted from a city-leased facility, move into a commercial building on 
West MacArthur Boulevard, an alternative that would cost the city more than 
$177,000 over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The building at 1695 W. MacArthur Blvd. is home to the Community Development 
Council, a private poverty agency that does not offer direct services to 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the CDC would sublease 4,200 square feet of space on the 
ground floor of the two-story building to SOS for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The city would pay the balance of the $3,800-a-month rent for three years with 
SOS gradually assuming financial responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council earlier this month rejected a similar proposal to help SOS 
move into a building on Superior Avenue, arguing that the plan was too costly. 
</P>
<P>
This plan is different, Buffa said, because the CDC building would require 
fewer renovations than the Superior Avenue location. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa said the CDC proposal would also offer the charity more time to purchase 
and renovate a building of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of SOS, being evicted from its home at the Rea Community Center, 
announced Thursday that they had received more than $300,000 in contributions 
and were negotiating to purchase permanent quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Directors said it makes more sense for the City Council to extend the agency's 
lease at the Rea center for two to three months rather than have it make two 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel the (CDC) move is in the best interests of us or the city," said 
SOS founder and executive director Jean Forbath. "We are very pleased that the 
city is concerned . . . and we will not discount the proposal, but it is still 
a last alternative." 
</P>
<P>
SOS leaders will rally today from 2 to 4 p.m. at a park near the Rea center, 
then proceed to the steps of City Hall and begin a 50-hour fast to protest the 
agency's ejection. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to take up the SOS issue at its Monday meeting. SOS 
officials say they will ask for an extention at the Rea center, while Buffa 
will recommend that the council approve the CDC move. 
</P>

CITIES' AID ASKED TO RUN ARMORIES FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the City Hall in Mission Viejo to elementary schools and civic meetings in 
Brea, volunteers are passing the hat this month so that two National Guard 
armories can remain open for Orange County's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton have been used for the past three years 
as a place of warm refuge for up to 250 homeless people on cold, wintry nights. 
They are due to open again today with rain forecast. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, however, the Orange County Social Services Agency, which operates 
the armory-shelter program, sent an urgent plea for assistance to most of the 
cities in Orange County, saying it needed money and staff to continue operating 
the armories. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running out of money, to be quite honest with you," said Margaret 
Beck, manager of the county's emergency-shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county has been using two federal grants to defray the $66,000 
annual costs in operating the shelters, the July letter to the cities point out 
that the grants do not cover site management and security. Security costs last 
year totaled about $15,000. Site management is provided by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to All Cities 
</P>
<P>
"The problem of homelessness needs the commitment of all levels of government, 
as well as community organizations and individual citizens," Larry M. Leaman, 
director of the County Social Services Agency, says in the letter to mayors. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to all cities in Orange County, with the exceptions of Dana 
Point, San Clemente, Laguna Beach, Los Alamitos, San Juan Capistrano and Villa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dottie Goehring, staff analyst in charge of the county's homeless shelter 
program, explained that those cities either already had their own homeless 
shelter programs or had no significant homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
The county's goal is to raise at least $15,000 this month from the cities and 
gain commitments for volunteers to staff the armories. 
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, Beck said, the county making good progress achieving that goal, 
having received checks totaling $10,500 from the cities of Mission Viejo, 
Orange and Placentia. Volunteer staffing has been provided by the cities of 
Anaheim, Santa Ana and Cypress, and Brea is in the midst of a drive to raise 
$3,000, Beck added. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea effort, spearheaded by a local church, has involved schools, churches, 
civic clubs and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We passed the hat at a recent Rotary Club meeting and one fellow said, 'Here 
is a check for $50,' " said George Saunders, a First Baptist Church pastor who 
is coordinating the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Mohn, manager of community services for Brea, said the city will also be 
launching a drive soon to collect donations from city employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic that we will have a good response," Mohn said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest outpouring has come from the city of Orange, which donated 
$5,000. City officials elsewhere pledged to continue the assistance for as long 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Leaman says the armories could not operate as shelters without 
security guards posted to prevent trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Anaheim offered its staff to help manage the Fullerton armory and 
Santa Ana provided city park rangers for security at its armory. This is the 
first year that the county has asked any other cities to help out. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Santa Ana and Fullerton armories are able to house only a fraction 
of the county's homeless, which is estimated at between 4,000 and 10,000, 
county officials said the buildings do provide critical shelter for "a 
significant number" of people who otherwise would have to sleep out in the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
The shelters are opened when temperatures are predicted to drop below 40 
degrees or there is a 50% chance for rain. 
</P>
<P>
"This program provides a relatively easy and inexpensive opportunity for local 
government agencies to demonstrate their concerns by working in coordination 
with local community organizations and volunteers," Leaman says in his letter 
to the cities.

DOWN-TO-EARTH ARTIST GETS INSPIRATION FROM UNIVERSAL FORCES; 
</P>
<P>
ART: LITA ALBUQUERQUE TELLS AN AUDIENCE AT THE LAGUNA ART MUSEUM WHAT'S BEHIND 
HER ENVIRONMENTAL CREATIONS.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The constant blowing of the wind, the flat horizon and "violent eruptions of 
birds singing" created the sensual backdrop for Lita Albuquerque's youth in a 
Tunisian fishing village. "Nature became my companion," the artist, who now 
lives in Los Angeles, told a captivated audience at the Laguna Art Museum on 
Thursday morning. "I really grew up thinking about my relationship to the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque initially summarized her art matter-of-factly as dealing with 
"geometry, alignments (of objects), color and combination of metals with 
geometry and color." But she devoted most of her talk to the ways she feels it 
expresses her perceptions of major forces in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't work for the mind," she emphasized. "I work phenomenally, perceiving 
through all the senses. My intelligence is from the body, not from the mind. 
When one sees (my work), one does respond through the body. Everything I do is 
symbolic." 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque, 43, has exhibited her installations and paintings widely in the 
United States and is the subject of a retrospective exhibition opening Jan. 18 
at the Santa Monica Museum. An untitled painting of hers from 1985 recently was 
acquired for the Laguna Art Museum by its Contemporary Collector's Council. 
</P>
<P>
A vibrant woman whose face is framed by shaggy curtains of long dark hair, she 
often couches her remarks in New Age metaphysical terms. 
</P>
<P>
She refers to gold -- which she has used extensively in her work during the 
past three years -- as "a very transformative color." Her previous use of 
copper was "about the reflectivity of the planet." The full moon that waxed 
during the creation of one of her works gave her "tremendous energies." And 
toward the end of her "Good Morning Laguna" talk, she confided mysteriously 
that she is "very involved in power spots." 
</P>
<P>
Her color slides of site-specific work, such as "Malibu Line," frequently 
elicited oohs and ahhs from her audience. In the piece, a broad path of bright 
blue pigment stretching down a bluff to the ocean creates a vivid T-shaped area 
of color, like a secret channel of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is from 1978 when, after moving from Malibu to an inland Venice 
studio, she had stopped making art. Something was missing. "I didn't have that 
view," she said. "The horizon line wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
She began taking walks near the beach and photographing "the verticality of my 
body in relation to the horizon." She realized that the intersection of her 
body and the horizon produced a cross form. ("That's where symbols come from.") 
The experience moved her to dig a trench on the bluff and fill it with blue 
pigment. 
</P>
<P>
Blue became her trademark color, evocative of "space, the universe." On a trip 
to Death Valley, she decided she wanted to cover all the rocks with blue 
pigment so they would "dissolve into the sky." Although friends restrained her 
from attempting the project, she has made several pieces in dry lake beds that 
involve the dusting of rocks or earth with color. (In response to a question 
from the audience, she said she uses clay-based pigments that are not toxic.) 
</P>
<P>
These pieces are ephemeral, of course, changing with every breath of wind. At 
first, Albuquerque said she worried that the wind would ruin her images of 
figures, circles and triangles. But she became intrigued with the way the 
pigment interacted with the forces of nature -- or even with the intrusive 
actions of motorcyclists leaving wheel tracks in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
For "Windows Into the Earth," made for a private home, she set a triangular 
patch of blue pigment on the unfinished driveway. The piece subsequently was 
covered by asphalt, but Albuquerque said she considers it to be still in place 
-- even if unseen -- awaiting some puzzled future archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
Her "Washington Monument Project, The Red Pyramid," from 1980, traced the tip 
of the shadow of the famous obelisk in Washington as it fell due west, north 
and east by means of 80-foot-long, 8-inch-deep, V-shaped trenches of red 
pigment. To the artist, the geometry created by the relationship of the Earth 
revolving around the sun conveys a kind of primal energy. 
</P>
<P>
Although she briefly acknowledged the red tape involved in that piece (it "was 
right in front of the White House!"), Albuquerque didn't dwell on the logistics 
of making her work, even though at the time she had to juggle everything with 
the help of only one assistant. (She now has five.) 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, she preferred to dwell on the perceptions that enrich her from 
traveling -- to the Yucatan, to Egypt, or even to Sedona, Ariz. There, she 
said, a mere three days of drinking in the sensory qualities of the landscape 
gave her ideas for two years of work.

HOLD YOUR HORSES: Theatergoers in Orange County would be wise not to get 
excited just yet about the possible theater envisaged as part of a 
$400-million, 18-acre Main Street Concourse proposed for Santa Ana earlier this 
week by a Japanese developer. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely what kind of theater would be built to go with the two planned office 
towers (one of which, at 32 stories, would be the county's tallest), the 
350-room hotel and the hundreds of condominiums?

"We don't know yet," said Steven W. Spillman, a vice president for development 
at Birtcher, the Laguna Niguel developer advising Shimizu America Corp., the 
Japanese developer hired to build the project for the Orient Corp., a Japanese 
consumer finance company that owns the land. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that we're right at the beginning and we haven't 
thought a lot of these things through," Spillman continued. "But we are looking 
at a community space that would encourage people to use an auditorium for dance 
performances. And we are talking about multipurpose rooms for other 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Spillman said it would take at least six months for more specific ideas 
regarding the auditorium to coalesce, but that the "thinking right now is that 
it should be able to accommodate small- to medium-size theater groups" as well. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is finally decided, he added, "it would probably be several years 
before we start construction on this project."

The Main Street Concourse site is across North Main Street from the 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall north of downtown.

GOING UP: Patrons of the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa 
will face a de facto price increase tonight with the opening of Verdi's "La 
Traviata." The parking fee at the facilities serving the Center, as well as 
neighboring South Coast Repertory, has gone up to $4, an increase of $1. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Century Parking Inc., which operates the garages, boosted the 
price on Jan. 1. SCR patrons confronted the increase for the first time eight 
days ago at a preview performance of Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy." 
</P>
<P>
There has been no price resistance from theatergoers "so far," Century's 
parking director John Yglesis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction also was muted from officials at both SCR and the Center, neither of 
which receives income from the parking facilities or has any control over the 
parking fee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sure there are contributing economic factors that necessitate this 
increase," said Paula Tomei, SCR's general manager. "At the same time, we're 
upset by anything that adds to the cost of attending the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Center President Thomas F. Kendrick also said the boost was regrettable but 
understandable because of "inflationary pressures." He pointed out that the new 
fee is "in line" with similar facilities at other arts institutions such as the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Century-operated parking facilities serving the Center and SCR have a total 
capacity of 2,626 cars. The $3 fee had been in effect for two years, Yglesis 
said. Both SCR and the Center were notified of the increase last May.

ALLEN TO BRING 'MEN ARE PIGS' GIG TO IRVINE IMPROV

Men are pigs. 
</P>
<P>
That's the launching point for Tim Allen's stand-up act. In Allen's world, the 
men gather round to grunt approvingly at the new lawn mower on the block. They 
track grease through the house as a way of marking territory, and turn a visit 
to the tool department at Sears into some kind of religious/sexual pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
If the household dusting were left to Allen, he would duct-tape all those 
annoying knickknacks down and fire up the leaf blower. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's fresh but decidedly middle-American slant on the old 
men-and-their-tools routine has, to his own surprise, earned him a loyal and 
growing following in trend-happy Southern California. He'll be in Los Angeles 
tonight to tape a segment of the syndicated series "Comic Strip Live" before 
heading south for a sold-out Sunday night gig at the Irvine Improv. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have thought Southern California would have taken to me," Allen 
said this week during a phone interview from his Detroit home. But when he 
appeared on a four-comic bill at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim last May, he 
got the biggest audience response -- and when he returned to Orange County in 
July for an extended stand at the Laff Stop, fans greeted him with his own 
trademark "men are pigs" snort. 
</P>
<P>
Allen gives a good part of the credit for his local success to the weekday 
radio feature "Five O'Clock Funnies" on KLOS-FM, which has featured him 
regularly. And he believes that Orange County's suburban flavor -- where 
"taking care of your house and going to the hardware store are very fulfilling" 
-- may explain why he has been able to build the exposure into a following 
here. 
</P>
<P>
No overnight success (he first took the stage as a comic in 1979), Allen has 
toured incessantly for five years, building other loyal pockets of fans 
throughout the Midwest and East. He even has a few devotees who follow him, 
Grateful Dead-style, from gig to gig. 
</P>
<P>
While he describes himself up as a solidly Midwestern kind of guy, he does live 
in Los Angeles' Hancock Park a few months out of the year, acting in 
commercials and attending auditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it there," Allen said. "It's kind of a neighborhoody place. . . . 
There's gutters to be cleaned. I could bring my parents there and they'd say, 
'This is Los Angeles?' " 
</P>
<P>
He says his "hardware-storeish" material stems at least partly from his own 
interests -- he's a car fan who owns a vintage Mustang and a new Cadillac -- 
and he finds particular inspiration on the streets of Los Angeles. "I almost 
break my neck looking at cars around there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the former hardware salesman berated all those new, warehouse-style 
discount hardware outlets, stating his preference for the small, neighborhood 
store near his home in Detroit where the owner "knows every goddamn screw in 
the place." 
</P>
<P>
After his very first night on stage as a comic, Allen broke a ceramic tile from 
the floor of the club; he now has it framed and mounted on his wall, with the 
date written in felt pen: "3/23/79." 
</P>
<P>
He claims he keeps it so that "when I go back to working in a hardware store, I 
can tell my granddaughter, 'I used to be a comic.' And she'll say, 'Oh, sure.' 
"
