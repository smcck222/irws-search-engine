The Chinese have many proverbs, but an American one pertains here: "It's an ill 
wind that blows no good." In 1970, during the height of China's Cultural 
Revolution, Wang Anyi, a 16-year-old student, was sent to the famine-ravaged 
northern province of Anhui, to learn, as intellectuals were supposed to in 
those days, from "the workers, peasants and soldiers." Wang Anyi stayed there 
for eight years before she was permitted to return to her family in Shanghai. 
In 1984, six years after her return to the city, she revisited the place of her 
harsh exile. "In the autumn of that year," the blurb here tells us, "Baotown" 
was written. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a wonderful book. And in one of the ironies that runs through all 
serious literature, Wang Anyi (who looks out the back of this novel as sexy, 
alluring, gorgeous, cosmopolitan, worldly, stunning) really did seem to learn 
one of the main lessons of the Cultural Revolution: that there is a reason why 
Chinese workers have endured, survived, through centuries and centuries. It's a 
quality that even a translator as fine as Martha Avery would have trouble 
putting into English words -- a quality of stubbornness and curiosity; a love 
of food, and little parties, and goofy stories, and rural scandals; a pure, 
primitive, intensely alive interest in what's going to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
Baotown is a crummy little village out in the north Chinese boondocks. It's 
down at the bottom of Bao Mountain and it's known -- if it's known at all -- 
for the ferocity of its floods when it becomes nothing more or less than a 
great big lake. Over the hill from Baotown is another place called Fengtown, 
and all the families in the area know each other, know about each other, or are 
related in some way. 
</P>
<P>
(The translator takes care of a possible problem beautifully. In a story where 
almost everyone is named Bao and half of those carry either the middle names 
Ren or Yan, Avery gives some of these characters their true Chinese names, 
while others carry Cultural Revolution labels like Culture or Society. Still 
others are named Little Jade or given harsher monikers like Picked-up, Second 
Aunt or the eloquently descriptive Dregs.) 
</P>
<P>
To tell the stories of the people in Baotown would be to give the fun away. How 
can any of this be "fun" when the distinctive black hair of Baotown's citizens 
has turned yellow from malnutrition; when getting a new bed is as astonishing 
as winning the American Publishers Sweepstakes, where everyone in the book is 
on the verge of starvation (or drowning) at any given moment of this tale? Just 
because it is fun, far more fun, from Wang Anyi's point of view to be alive 
than dead. 
</P>
<P>
These stories weave together the way they would in any town. There's that 
beautiful smart girl called Little Jade who is supposed to be marrying the town 
lummox. How she gets out of this is an ongoing shaggy-dog tale. There's a sweet 
woman who raises a boy-child, and then, one day, the boy-child grows too big 
for social comfort: In a contest among affection, lust and/or family loyalty, a 
series of imaginative arrangements must be made. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is young Bao Renwen, the perennial geek who wants to write a novel 
(every village has one!), to the consternation of an old revolutionary, who 
asks him, "Can you get any money from a book?" When Bao Renwen answers, 
"There's no money in it. During the Cultural Revolution they abolished 
royalties," the old revolutionary is stumped. "Then what do you want?" he asks. 
The young writer scarcely knows. He hangs a sign above his bed at home -- 
"Diligence Produces Genius" -- and he begins to write stories about his humble 
hometown. Bao Renwen's diligence produces far more than he dreams. 
</P>
<P>
This is a marvelously interesting book, because, before this, we had to read 
about China's Cultural Revolution in the propagandistic language of that 
revolution. Here, the language and sensibility are far more sophisticated, 
"civilized," "educated." But the bedrock values come from the revolution, and 
the thousands of years behind that revolution; a crazy, impassioned love for 
the land (even its floods and famines) of China itself. 
</P>
<P>
This is a love story; a beautiful one -- a funny one.

CRAMPED CHRONICLE OF AMERICA'S TOCQUEVILLE; 
</P>
<P>
GENET: A BIOGRAPHY OF JANET FLANNER BY BRENDA WINEAPPLE (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: 
$24.95; 361 PP.; 0-089919-442-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' books include Plaintext and Remembering the Bone House, 
both published by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From 1925 until 1975, Janet Flanner wrote The New Yorker's Letters From Paris 
under the pseudonym Genet. The daughter of a prosperous Indianapolis mortician, 
who killed himself when she was 19, and a woman whose theatrical ambitions had 
been frustrated by her marriage and the birth of three daughters, Flanner fled 
the Midwest by marrying a classmate from the University of Chicago and moving 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, she fled the marriage in the company of Solita Solano, the first 
of the several women she loved, and the two settled eventually in Paris. The 
career of this writer with the ambiguous pen name, considered by admirers 
"America's Toqueville," provides the focus for Brenda Wineapple's respectful, 
responsible but lackluster biography. 
</P>
<P>
On the face of it, Flanner's life promises to make a rich and intriguing tale. 
On her arrival in Paris in the '20s, she was drawn into the community of 
expatriates whose names still glitter today: Gertrude Stein and Alice B. 
Toklas, Sylvia Beach, Ernest Hemingway, Kay Boyle. . . . In addition to her 
Letters From Paris, The New Yorker published her lengthy profiles of some of 
the foremost figures in 20th-Century art, literature and politics, among them 
Pablo Picasso, Edith Wharton, even Adolf Hitler. Although she left France for 
the United States during World War II, on her return, she traveled widely to 
report on the war's aftermath, including the Nuremberg trials. 
</P>
<P>
For years, with the suavity of an international diplomat, she simultaneously 
sustained relationships with three beautiful women -- Solita Solano, Noel 
Haskins Murphy and Natalia Danesi Murray -- "keeping present and former lovers 
and friends away from one another, arranging itineraries and schedules so as to 
prevent discord as much as possible and to protect herself and others." 
</P>
<P>
If Wineapple's account lacks the animation such circumstances would seem to 
engender, the difficulty may lie in the subject herself. To a considerable 
extent, Wineapple makes clear, Genet functioned not just as a nom de plume but 
as a mask, permitting Flanner to remain, in true New Yorker style, "witty, 
distant, and uninvolved." The journalistic advantage of this persona was that 
it permitted a double vision, placing Flanner "inside history because she was 
there, as well as outside it, as an American in Paris, a woman, a spectator." 
</P>
<P>
But the disadvantage to the biographer is suggested by Flanner's resistance to 
writing her memoirs: "After so many years spent studiously avoiding the word I, 
she was hardly about to embark on a project in which the first person was 
essential. Moreover, she must have thought that writing her memoirs would make 
public her private life, and this she would not do. Her life had been an 
eminently private one, devoted to concealment, not revelation, and the 
conscious crafting of an identity." 
</P>
<P>
So adamantine a veneer prohibits the biographer, and therefore the reader, from 
bringing the person crouched beneath it to life; the veneer itself must simply 
do. The remark of one critic reviewing Flanner's generally acclaimed Paris 
Journal might apply to Genet as well: "Rather than objectivity about events 
which no longer excite and which are too fragmentarily related to rank as 
history, the reader might prefer more of Miss Flanner herself." 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, however, a responsible biographer can reveal only what her subject 
has permitted to become known. All the same, Wineapple might have strengthened 
her presentation through more penetrating literary judgment and livelier 
literary techniques. She cites, for example, one of Flanner's major themes, her 
lifelong wistfulness for the past, noting that in 1921, she believed that "the 
civilization of today, influenced by bourgeoise self-interest, is moving away 
from an ideal," embodied in the Acropolis. 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, "the world seemed more and more incomprehensible, with its burgeoning 
skyscrapers, its ugliness, its continuing violence, its youth subculture, its 
scatalogical language," and Flanner "craved a turning backward," this time not 
to Attic glory but to the same 1920s she had earlier decried. But Wineapple 
never explores the significance of this implicit intellectual stasis for 
Flanner the woman or Genet the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Genet's strengths, according to Wineapple, lay in "her strong reactions, her 
vivid pictorial sense, her sharp metaphor, her common sense, and even the 
crushes she sometimes got on people and movements." With the exception of 
common sense, these qualities are largely missing from the biography. 
</P>
<P>
A brief passage in the preface describing one of Flanner's homes suggests that 
Wineapple can use concrete detail evocatively, but for the most part, people, 
places and incidents fail to come alive. Instead, the style is relentlessly 
expository. Apparently believing herself duty-bound to account for Flanner's 
whereabouts at all times, Wineapple, for instance, shuttles us back and forth, 
back and forth, back and forth across the Atlantic on nearly indistinguishable 
trips that leave us woozy with jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
Genet's lack of flair should not dissuade readers interested in 20th-Century 
literary and social history. Through her thorough research, Wineapple has 
documented the life and world of a writer whose journalistic style, urbane and 
ironic, remains an antidote to gonzo journalism and related disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the volume itself is appealing; the cover is attractively designed, 
using an antique endpaper; the text is printed in a handsome typeface on 
good-quality stock; a small array of photographs is well-selected. It should 
well please all biographiles.

VICE VERSA: WEAKNESS INTO ART; 
</P>
<P>
T. S. ELIOT AND PREJUDICE BY CHRISTOPHER RICKS (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: 
$25; 290 PP.; 0-520-06578-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nick Owchar, Owchar is a Dunbar Fellow at the Gould Center of Humanistic 
Studies, Claremont-McKenna College, studying literary modernism in the works of 
T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1933, the poet Thomas Stearns Eliot gave a series of lectures in Virginia, 
eventually to be published under the title "After Strange Gods." The lectures 
focused on the importance of a cultural tradition, specifically the American 
tradition in the Southern states, but the lectures will be remembered more for 
furthering the charges of Eliot's anti-Semitism than the cause of tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy centers on a passage about the need for stability in a society 
developing a tradition: "The population should be homogeneous. . . . What is 
still more important is unity of religious background; and reasons of race and 
religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
There also are early poems, such as "Burbank With a Baedeker: Bleistein With a 
Cigar," that express anti-Semitism: "The rats are underneath the piles./The Jew 
is underneath the lot." 
</P>
<P>
Combined with these, the statement about "free-thinking Jews" has made 
anti-Semitism as lasting a part of Eliot's legacy as his receipt of the Nobel 
Prize for Literature in 1948. But Christopher Ricks reconsiders the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In Eliot's prose and poetry, Ricks finds a sensibility struggling to 
rationalize its own prejudice and the nature of prejudice in general. "Eliot is 
from the beginning preoccupied with prejudice because it constitutes an 
intersection of philosophy, psychology, politics, and art." It also is a 
struggle that Eliot did not always win. 
</P>
<P>
Ricks does what is needed to an issue that has sat, growing in its own 
sensationalism, for the last 50 years. There is no doubt about his appreciation 
for Eliot's mastery as a poet, but he does not excuse Eliot's anti-Semitism 
either. What Ricks offers are explanations, acknowledging their incompleteness, 
that may help us toward an understanding not only of Eliot's biases but of 
prejudice in general. 
</P>
<P>
This position has been challenged by Leon Wieseltier, and Ricks addresses 
Wieseltier in the book. Wieseltier says the horror of the Holocaust cannot be 
explained. The victims of that brutality are innocent; "it came unbidden from 
the outside." To understand the issue would mean assigning the victim a part in 
the cause, but Wieseltier argues "when the victim is an accomplice, evil is -- 
banal." 
</P>
<P>
The brutality of the Holocaust certainly makes discussions of anti-Semitism 
difficult in this century. But if we accept Wieseltier's argument, Ricks says, 
prejudice becomes irrational, and this abolishes "the chances of the rational 
reduction of prejudice." To treat it rationally, no matter what the pitfalls, 
is to maintain the chances for change. 
</P>
<P>
But understanding prejudice is easier in theory than in practice. Ricks devotes 
a long chapter to the nature of prejudice. What is discussed, supported with 
the work of Edmund Burke and William Godwin in the 18th Century, is the 
necessity of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
Ricks draws on many interesting sources for his information. William James' 
observation on the conformity of young professionals shows, gratifyingly, that 
my generation is not responsible for the yuppie. Allan Bloom, sounding 
controversial but actually making good sense, says he tries to teach prejudice 
to his students. For him, it is important that his students believe in 
something before they learn to doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The enormity of the issue creates an attitude in the book similar to "He that 
is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone." What Ricks is doing is 
deflating our tendency to sit in judgment of another person's supposed guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Is the tone of the lines "In the room the women come and go/Talking of 
Michelangelo" from Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" obvious? 
Literary critics Hugh Kenner, Helen Gardner and Grover Smith are assured that 
the speaker is condescending. Gardner and Kenner hear whiny feminine voices, 
while Smith says the women talk "no doubt tediously and ignorantly." Ricks 
shows that these assurances are unfounded; the lines are actually very 
toneless, and open to many interpretations. It is a lesson to us that even our 
critics, trusted for their explanations, are not infallible. 
</P>
<P>
This ambiguity is not accidental, nor is Eliot unaware that he is loading the 
title of his first volume of verse with a clunker, "Prufrock." He knew what the 
name would do to people's expectations of a poem called a "love song." It was 
Eliot's way of showing how easily we make judgments, even on the basis of a 
name; "how so little information controls so much behavior." Already with his 
first volume, Eliot was winking at the public's predictability, and making 
satire of it. 
</P>
<P>
One convincing argument concerning anti-Semitism in Eliot's poetry is treating 
it in relation to content. An error that readers make, and Eliot exploits, is 
to assume the printed word always reflects the true feelings of the author, 
when it may be only the dramatic persona's. 
</P>
<P>
The speaker of "Gerontion" is a sick man with a "dry brain," living in a 
decaying house (house so often is a metaphor for the body). A person in such a 
rotting condition may foster a questionable perception of the world. When we 
read that "the Jew squats on the window sill, the owner," we must remember the 
questionable mental state of the speaker. In fact, in much of the poetry cited 
for instances of anti-Semitism, Ricks says, the narrator's authority is 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Other explanations are connected to Eliot's relationship with his father. Eliot 
grew up in a Unitarian household, the son of a strict father, and William 
Empson interprets Eliot's anti-Semitism as a symbolic repudiation of his father 
and his father's religion. 
</P>
<P>
Empson takes Eliot's opinion that the Jewish religion, liberalized, becomes a 
"colourless form of Unitarianism" and says, "If you are hating a purse-proud 
businessman who denies that Jesus is God, into what stereotype does he best 
fit? He is a Jew. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ricks' own opinion is more tactful. One of the more offensive poems, "Dirge" 
("Full fathom five your Bleistein lies/Under the flatfish and the squids"), was 
a poem Eliot never published -- it happened after his death -- and he never 
permitted a second printing of "After Strange Gods." Ricks sees in these 
actions a recognition of his mistakes. And this is the premise that guides the 
second half of the book, taking him from "The Waste Land" to "Four Quartets." 
</P>
<P>
In doing this, Ricks takes us and the concept of prejudice into the mechanics 
of poetry. Eliot's meticulous care for the formation of lines is discussed in 
relation to his influences, Shakespeare and Dante. Ricks recognizes Eliot's 
debt to them, while still maintaining the innovation Eliot made in 20th-Century 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Ricks' careful attention to Eliot's poetics is a joy to read. He enhances the 
poetry for those who, when they read poetry, whip through it as if it were a 
faster-format newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
It would not be inappropriate if his book were subtitled something like "A 
study in the art of making poetry," because he illustrates the poet's tools 
better than one would expect (due to a prejudgment, no doubt?) in a book about 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear from this study that poetry, in a sense, requires prejudice. Poetry 
is the synthesis of the poet's words with the reader's comprehension. Most 
often with drama, the artist deliberately leaves mood up to the actor. An 
expression like "Ah, soldier!" from Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" has 
many interpretations. The woman utters it after Cleopatra's death, and then she 
dies too. So is this a cry of pain? Or does she mourn the queen's death? 
</P>
<P>
Eliot's struggle with prejudice is connected to his belief that weaknesses 
could be turned into art. He once said of Dostoevsky that he studied his 
epilepsy and hysteria in order to open up a "personal universe." Ricks says the 
same of Eliot. And this self-contemplation of human spirit, Ricks reminds us, 
also includes "human personality at its lowest." The low points for Eliot are 
when anti-Semitism finds expression in his poetry. 
</P>
<P>
In the entire study, the area excluded, surprisingly, is Eliot's anti-Irish 
sentiment. "Apeneck Sweeney," a stereotype of the violent, uneducated Irishman, 
appears many times in Eliot's poems, but is overlooked here. However, Ricks 
says more biographical inquiry into Eliot's life is needed, and maybe this will 
be a part of the next study to penetrate even further into Eliot's "Gioconda 
smile."

BARTERING RECOGNITION FOR PUTATIVE POWS?; 
</P>
<P>
VIETNAM NOW: A CASE FOR NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH HANOI BY JOHN LEBOUTILLIER 
INTRODUCTION BY RICHARD M. NIXON (PRAEGER: $18.95; 144 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joseph J. Zasloff, Zasloff, professor of political science at the University 
of Pittsburgh, is the editor of a forthcoming book, LaosBeyond the Revolution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This book calls for the United States to normalize diplomatic relations with 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, immediately and without preconditions. In 
his dedication, the author reveals what he considers the principal benefit to 
be derived from this action: "To the hundreds of American Prisoners of War, 
still held against their will, who will be freed only when there is a new 
relationship between Washington and Hanoi." The U.S. policy of economic and 
diplomatic isolation of Vietnam since 1975, he contends, has thrust Hanoi into 
the arms of Moscow and increased the Soviet presence in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
This flawed U.S. policy of hostility to Hanoi has been imposed, the author 
asserts, by a clandestine group of second-level officials within the Executive 
Branch with links to the CIA. This cabal, whose adherents shared a common 
experience during the Vietnam War, still is angry that the United States lost 
the War in Congress and on the American streets, the author believes, and is 
punishing Hanoi with harsh measures of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
The author, John Leboutillier, is a right-wing former Congressman from New York 
who served one term in Congress, from 1981 to 1983. For the past six years he 
has been president of a group called Account for POW/MIAs Inc., which proclaims 
itself "dedicated to bringing home living American POWs still held in 
Indochina." 
</P>
<P>
While Leboutillier's call for normalization with Hanoi is not without merit, 
his fundamental assumption is doubtful and his political analysis twisted. He 
provides no evidence that American prisoners are alive in Indochina. No sources 
are cited for his assertions -- the book is devoid of footnotes. Professionals 
within the U.S. government who have been responsible for investigating the 
POW/MIA issue since the Communist takeover of Indochina in 1975 point out that 
there is minimal possibility that any American POWs are alive in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Administration's position from 1976 to 1981, following careful 
investigation of all leads about POW/MIAs, was encapsulated in the official 
statement: "There is no credible evidence to indicate that any Americans are 
currently held against their will in Indochina." A Select Committee of the 
House of Representatives on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, after a 15-month 
investigation which began in September of 1975, concluded that "no Americans 
are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result 
of the war in Indochina." However, many specialists on the MIA/POW issue in 
both Congress and the executive branch believe that Hanoi may possess 
information and possibly the remains of American POW/MIAs which it has not yet 
provided to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Even former President Nixon, who provides an introduction to this book, 
expresses doubt about the author's contention, noting, "I do not share the 
author's optimism that Americans are still alive in Indochina." Nixon does make 
the argument that Hanoi must account for all of the MIAs before the United 
States normalizes relations. But on this score also, Nixon disagrees on "timing 
and tactics" with Leboutillier, who insists that the United States should 
establish diplomatic relations with Hanoi without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the weight of evidence that no American POW/MIAs remain alive in 
Indochina, a suspicion to the contrary continues to haunt segments of the 
American public, the armed services and the Congress. It is understandable that 
families who have lost a husband or son in Indochina would cling to the hope 
that he is still alive. The issue has been kept active by a small but well 
organized pressure group, the National League of Families of American Prisoners 
and Missing in Southeast Asia. Popular films like "Rambo" and TV features about 
MIAs have sustained the belief of some that Americans are being held captive in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration, reflecting President Reagan's strong personal 
interest in the MIA question, altered the approach of the Carter Administration 
with the following announcement: "Although we have thus far been unable to 
prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information 
available to us precludes ruling out that possibility." The Bush Administration 
appears to be continuing the approach of its predecessor. Thus, in the absence 
of reliable guidance from authoritative government sources that the chances are 
minimal that American prisoners remain alive in Indochina, political 
pronouncements like those found in this book will continue to cloud the issue 
of U.S. relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
There are sound reasons of U.S. national interest to give serious consideration 
to normalization of diplomatic relations with Hanoi. Cyrus Vance, President 
Carter's Secretary of State, pursued negotiations for normalization of 
relations with Hanoi, but these efforts gave way to U.S. normalization 
negotiations with Beijing, spearheaded by former National Security Adviser 
Zbigniew Brzezinski, which took priority. 
</P>
<P>
When negotiations with Vietnam resumed and almost had reached fruition, they 
were postponed indefinitely when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December of 1978. 
The United States subsequently put forth the condition that Vietnam must 
withdraw its troops from Cambodia before normalization could proceed. Now that 
Vietnam has apparently withdrawn its troops (a development not treated in this 
book, since it went to press before the Vietnamese withdrawal), there is reason 
for reconsideration of normalization. 
</P>
<P>
Certain bilateral issues of concern to the United States, such as the 
emigration of Amerasians, the treatment of political prisoners, the orderly 
departure of refugees, and visas to Vietnam for Vietnamese refugees living in 
America, as well as securing information about POW/MIAs, could be handled 
directly with Hanoi. The United States might open channels through which Hanoi 
could reduce its dependence upon the Soviet Union, if gradually, and increase 
Vietnam's potential for peaceful cooperation with its Southeast Asian neighbors 
and the West, a goal which the new Vietnamese leadership has publicly embraced. 
</P>
<P>
However, as long as China remains hostile to Vietnam, Hanoi should be expected 
to retain a close relationship with the Soviet Union that will serve as a 
counterweight to the threat from China. Nevertheless, terminating the isolation 
of Hanoi and drawing it into the rapidly developing world of Southeast Asia 
could reduce tensions, help with the solution of the refugee problem, and 
increase the potential for stability in the region.

FEAR AND REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting Pot," by Joel Kotkin 
(Nov. 5): The future will show that in Los Angeles, as with the United States, 
diversity of the people has strengthened us, not diminished us. My life has 
been enhanced by the variety of people that I have met of various races and 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
I am now able to solve problems in a variety of ways and look at them from 
different angles. 
</P>
<P>
I work for a company that helped send people to the moon. We did not do this by 
homogeneity. We accomplished this by having everyone work together and giving a 
variety of inputs. In the future, there will be many more global projects like 
this, and we need the diversity of people to succeed. Business is now global in 
every aspect. 
</P>
<P>
The world is changing quickly, too quickly for some people. Americans will have 
to get used to change if we want to compete globally. Los Angeles should feel 
lucky that these people chose us: They can help us move into the 21st Century.

I can't believe people in charge of "Julie &amp; Carol: Together Again" think 
that a pie/cake in the face routine is funny today. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't. It is incredible that two such wonderful performers who have such 
combustion together would agree to such stupid direction. I was looking forward 
to their special and it was a pleasure to see both Julie Andrews and Carol 
Burnett but certainly not with the routines they were expected to perform. The 
entire show was boring, ridiculous and devoid of humor.

Since I grew up with the classic cartoons of Walt Disney and Warner Bros., I 
find contemporary cartoons, which my 2-year-old is stuck with, virtually 
intolerable to sit through. What is supposed to be humorous lacks all creative 
humor whatsoever. It makes me laugh that people have voiced complaints of 
violence depicted in some of the old classics, yet no one minds the warfare 
depicted in "Ninja Turtles," "Beetlejuice" and the "G.I. Joe" and "RoboCop" 
cartoons.

What could Cinemax cable programmers have been thinking of when they scheduled 
"The Terror of the Tongs"? It is one of the most racially offensive films I 
have ever seen. I'm not even a member of the Chinese community and I found the 
film (which dealt with a captain seeking the killers of his daughter) 
unbearable. It needs to be canned and put in the film archives next to "Birth 
of a Nation"!

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: FALL FROM GRACE: THE FAILED CRUSADE OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT 
BY MICHAEL D'ANTONIO (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $19.95; 242 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONJA BOLLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This account by former Newsday religion writer Michael D'Antonio of the 
Christian Right's brief bid for political power in the figure of Pat Robertson 
is worth perusing for the rapid Chapter 1 overview alone, in which the writer's 
trenchant style makes short work of the absurdities in the movement. 
</P>
<P>
But that is an easy target. The main body of the book contains case histories 
of born-again Christians and scenes from D'Antonio's travels around the country 
to various born-again and charismatic congregations. The stories here are 
wonderfully revealing, even if D'Antonio's comments are equally revealing of 
his disdain for the sort of people who fall for Jesus talk. He visits Jimmy and 
Tammy Bakker's Heritage USA as well as Oral Roberts' City of Faith (where he is 
told that security guards will identify him because he sports that common 
journalist's eccentricity: a beard). As he looks at the reasons for people's 
conversions, D'Antonio lays bare the curious connection between the born-again 
Christian life and American conservative political ideas. A chapter on the 
pageant celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution at the massive Second 
Baptist Church of Houston explores the peculiar rewriting of history for 
emotional effect that dovetailed beautifully, D'Antonio maintains, with the 
Republican strategy in the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the religious right as a political force, D'Antonio says, was 
"eerily familiar from such works of fiction as 'Elmer Gantry' . . . Big-time, 
moralizing evangelists had always been undone by the sin of greed and the sins 
of the flesh." The spectacular fall and media feeding frenzy that followed the 
televangelist scandals finally allowed the Republicans to criticize the 
Christian groups without fear of being labeled suppressors of religion. When 
the Bush campaign attacked, D'Antonio says, "it became clear that the Christian 
Right was less a juggernaut than a man of straw." 
</P>
<P>
D'Antonio portrays the turn to the right as a logical but short-lived backlash 
against the gains made by the civil-rights and women's movements, which he 
unequivocally describes as "inevitable." His account leaves open no doubt that 
the Christian Right has evaporated as a political force. This is a comforting 
thought if one is not suspicious enough to look with a watchful eye at events 
outside of American borders. Religious fundamentalism may not have won the 
Republican presidential nomination in 1988, and the televangelists' empires may 
indeed have crumbled beyond repair, but it still seems overly optimistic to 
say, as D'Antonio does, that "Bush's election ensured the death of a movement, 
as he returned the nation to the professional politics of Nixon and Ford and 
abandoned the anomalous populism of Reagan and Falwell."

Photo, World War II GIs gather for a song around a Steinway "Victory Vertical" 
piano sent out by the company to entertain the troops. During the war, the New 
York Steinway factory was barred from making pianos, as they used materials 
required for the military effort; the shop was modified to make parts for troop 
transport gliders instead. The richly illustrated "Steinway" by Ronald V. 
Ratcliffe (Chronicle Books: $40) recounts the history of the American 
piano-making family and the 125-year-old firm that has manufactured pianos for 
some of the world's most famous musicians.

<P>
I just can't accept Frank McConnell's Dec. 31 review of (Thomas Pychon's) 
"Vineland." He is so obviously biased in favor of Pynchon that I'm sure if 
Pynchon bombed Aspen, McConnell would rave about his heroics. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell may or may not be correct in his assessment, but I hope that in all 
fairness you will give us another review of "Vineland."

'VINELAND' AND VINEGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of "Vineland," Frank McConnell alternates between a gee-whiz 
talking down to us and an Agnew-like linguisitic shell game. 
</P>
<P>
He actually assumes his readers won't understand the meaning of Vineland and 
1984, and throws in gratuitous references to "Astaire" and Thelonious Monk. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Plangent is a weak, ugly and obscure word for plaintive, and why call 
politics sclerotic? Sick, maybe, but is sclerosis more political than other 
diseases? 
</P>
<P>
Such is the currency of the pseudo-intellectuals -- not real words but marks of 
mutual recognition. . . .

BLUNTING THE HATCHET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Melvin Konner's opinions in his elegantly sly hatchet job on 
Norman Cousins' inspirational book, "Head First," (Book Review, Dec. 3), the 
1981 L.A. doctors' strike should have resulted in a "marked increase in pain 
and death." Quite the opposite occurred. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of public record that during the period when only emergency 
medical aid was available, the death rate dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Konner also chooses to overlook the conclusions of a federal government study 
of American medicine released in 1984 that found only 10 to 15% of all 
treatments by licensed physicians are of any benefit whatsoever to patients. 
</P>
<P>
With a track record like that, were I one of the "real doctors" Konner alludes 
to, instead of going to the office I'd stay home and read Cousins' book. My 
patients would be better off, I might learn something, and maybe even elevate 
my consciousness to the level of a "medical kibitzer."

In this delightful comedy of manners, Ruth Jhabvala uses the story of three 
English expatriates in Delhi to examine the changing role of women in a society 
divided between liberal, imported British values and traditional, paternalistic 
Indian mores. 
</P>
<P>
Clarissa's patronizing efforts to "go native" in grubby peasant costumes 
embarrass her friends; brittle, blond Etta places so much emphasis on her 
European sophistication that she becomes a self-caricature. Inspired by the 
love of her impractical Indian husband, sensible, level-headed Judy learns to 
reconcile seemingly inimical traditions into an agreeable way of life. Rising 
above her compatriots, she demonstrates the superiority of spiritual resources 
to mere creature comforts.

Austrian-born ethnographer Richard Erdoes presents a celebration of the rituals 
of the Great Plains and Southwestern Amerindian tribes that stresses their 
belief in the sacredness of the Earth and the unity of all life. 
</P>
<P>
His exceptional color photographs supplement descriptions of rites from 
19th-Century and contemporary sources. The resulting book offers a welcome 
counter to the popular images of Indians as either bloodthirsty savages in B 
Westerns or idealized noble red warriors. The inhabitants of an increasingly 
threatened planet have much to learn from the Indians' reverence for the Earth 
and its creatures.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many of these short stories set in Michigan's Upper Peninsula focus on the 
conflicts between the Finns and the Indians, two groups who continue to 
misunderstand each other despite more than a century of living in proximity. 
The unhappy lives of Sharon Dilworth's characters are shaped by the harsh 
winters and the continuing decline of the heavy industries that provided the 
economic base of the region. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, a man who works the ore boats succumbs to his fears of 
unemployment and to the demon-haunted storms on Lake Huron, leaving his family 
to piece together a life that has been irrevocably shattered, like the ice on 
the lake at winter's end. A moving account of blue-collar sorrows by a winner 
of the prestigious Iowa Short Fiction Award.

pleasure. Addicts wage golf, suffer from golf, are consumed by golf. To call 
the ordeal they undergo a golf game is the most moronic of oxymorons. 
</P>
<P>
The addict can be easily distinguished from the mere pleasure-seeker. When the 
latter dribbles his drive a pathetic 40 yards off the tee, he laughs 
idiotically. The addict who so disgraces himself is instantly stricken with 
what resembles a massive stroke or a terminal heart attack. He would no more 
laugh at his disgrace than Henry Kissinger would giggle if he tripped and fell 
flat as he made an entrance at Le Cirque. 
</P>
<P>
The addict is not necessarily a skillful golfer. He may never have broken 90. 
His hallmark is grim determination, not performance. He addresses every shot as 
if he were on the last hole of the Masters, knotted in a tie with Greg Norman 
and Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
This behavior is rooted in, and fertilized by, the unique nature of golf. Golf 
is the only sport in which the inept can, if blessed by fortune, match or 
surpass the performance of a professional. There are tournament professionals 
who have never scored a hole-in-one. Yet Richard Nixon, who took up golf in 
middle age, canned a tee shot in his first year of flailing at the ball. More 
incredibly, a young serviceman named Robert Halferty scored two consecutive 
aces -- one on a par-4 hole -- on April 21, 1945. In the long history of golf, 
no professional has ever matched this feat. 
</P>
<P>
If he persists -- and all addicts persist -- random fortune eventually will 
smile on the addict, if only for a few holes. Suddenly and unaccountably, his 
drives are long and straight, the iron shots crisp, the putts unerring. This is 
known as The Day Everything Went Right. It floods the addict's being with 
ecstasy, superior even to an erotic encounter with the woman of his secret 
dreams. It also validates a delusion embedded in the mind of every addict: that 
inside him there is a handcuffed Jack Nicklaus struggling to be freed. 
Thereafter, his life is devoted to liberating Jack, regaining that ecstasy and 
becoming multi-orgasmic. 
</P>
<P>
He buys how-to books, studies videotapes, takes lessons, chops up his lawn 
practicing his swing and buys every new "longest ball" and miracle-shafted 
club. When his non-golfing friends ask, "Why do you spend so much money making 
yourself so miserable?" he smiles with pity. He is pursuing a rapture they know 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Addicts even die for golf. Every club has its honor roll of those who breathed 
their last on the course in defiance of their cardiologists. This dedication is 
reflected in the oldest of golf jokes, about the addict who comes home and 
complains to his wife that he has just completed the worst round of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember old Louie, who has been in our foursome for years? He had a fatal 
heart attack on the 10th hole." 
</P>
<P>
"How sad," says his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," says the golfer. "For the rest of the round it was, 'Hit the ball, drag 
Louie, hit the ball, drag Louie.' " 
</P>
<P>
What follows, happily, is a true story about how golf and its addicts saved the 
life of a fellow addict. And saved him as surely as if they had snatched him 
from the path of an onrushing train. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT HAPPENED INVOLVED a long-running fivesome that was a fixture at Los 
Alamitos Country Club near Long Beach, a course recently bulldozed by some 
developer with a wallet for a heart. 
</P>
<P>
They were an odd quintet, bound only by their addiction: a Moose Lodge 
bartender, a former municipal court judge, a meat salesman, a retired Air Force 
colonel and a Long Beach writer. They were known respectively as the Bartender, 
Hizzoner, the Butcher, the Wing Commander and the Author. They were a political 
gallimaufry: two right-wing Republicans, two confirmed Democrats and a 
political agnostic. They rarely socialized off the course. 
</P>
<P>
They were the best of friends and the bitterest of enemies. They had contended 
against one another for 25 years. All had been respectable golfers in their 
prime, although not as good as they remembered themselves to be. In this they 
exemplified Chi Chi Rodriguez's axiom: "The older you get, the longer you used 
to hit the ball." 
</P>
<P>
As their ages and waist sizes had increased, so had their golf scores. They 
discounted their deterioration with improbable alibis. The Butcher would 
attribute a bad round to a hangover. The Author sulked if someone whispered 
during his backswing. The Bartender blamed his bad shots on the malfunctioning 
of his contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Each believed he was the best golfer in the group and reminisced relentlessly 
about his past glories. The Author boasted that he had once shot a 68 at 
Lakewood Country Club, and had verbally replayed the round so often that the 
group could join him in an a cappella recital. The Bartender countered with the 
assertion that he had broken par so many times in his prime that he had lost 
count. The Butcher related heady tales of pro-amateur tournaments in which he 
had outshot the pro. 
</P>
<P>
They had an institutional history as rich as the Knights of Malta. There was 
the time, for example, that Hizzoner horrendously hooked his tee shot on a par 
3 and then silenced the jeers by hitting a blind shot over a row of trees and 
into the cup. That day, the hole was rechristened "Here Comes the Judge." 
</P>
<P>
In their weekly Armageddons, they competed in a bewildering web of team bets, 
side bets, press bets, skin games and $2 Nassaus. Settling up later in the 
clubhouse bar was a raucous undertaking comparable to auditing the finances of 
a defunct savings-and-loan. All were genial winners and surly losers. The 
losers routinely announced that they were quitting the group forever, only to 
depart promising to "see you guys next Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
IT WAS THE AUTHOR WHO was snatched from the grave by his golfing brothers. One 
Saturday morning, rushing to get to the course on time, he stepped from the 
shower, slipped and struck the right side of his head against the tiled step. 
By the time he had shaved and hopped into his car, the pain had receded to a 
dull throb. Joining his group on the tee, he displayed the sizable lump and 
tried to negotiate a few extra strokes because of the trauma. "No way," said 
the Wing Commander. "Whacking yourself on the head will probably improve your 
golf swing. It's the only thing you haven't tried." 
</P>
<P>
The Author shot his customary high-80s round. Then he regretfully announced 
that he would be out of action for a month or so. "I've got a book to finish," 
he said. "And I've got to get ready for that lawsuit of mine." He had sued a 
Beverly Hills lawyer-literary agent for legal malpractice, and the case was 
nearing trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurry back," his friends said. "We need your money." 
</P>
<P>
That evening, when his wife saw the lump on his head and heard how he had 
acquired it, she urged him to see a doctor. The Author, however, was one of 
those mulish people who submit to an annual checkup only once in five years. He 
was encouraged in this intransigence by the fact that he had never been 
seriously ill in his life. He regarded his wife and daughters, who took every 
symptom to a doctor, as afflicted with self-indulgence. "If you leave it alone, 
your body will heal itself," he enjoyed saying. "Doctors are like car 
mechanics. If you tell them there is something wrong, they'll install a new 
transmission and send you an ungodly bill." 
</P>
<P>
In the next five weeks, he finished his manuscript and then attended to his 
lawsuit, in which two hostile lawyers grilled him for a week in a pretrial 
deposition. When it was over, the Beverly Hills agent settled out of court -- 
for $61,000 -- rather than risk trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Author also developed a marked drag in his left leg that heightened his 
wife's insistence that he see a doctor. "I think you injured your head in that 
fall," she said. "You don't walk the way you used to." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't walk with my head," he argued. "And how could I win a $61,000 
settlement with a damaged brain? I'm going out and catch up with my golf." And 
out to his car he trudged. 
</P>
<P>
The brotherhood welcomed him back, congratulated him on his legal victory and 
told him they were eager to share in his windfall. 
</P>
<P>
"Over my dead body," said the Author. Then he waggled his driver, cranked up 
and sent the ball skittering a miserable 60 yards down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
On the front nine, he didn't hit a single decent shot. On the ninth green, 
faced with a 4-foot putt for a triple bogey, he stroked the ball and barely 
moved it a foot. He had lost every hole and was nine down to each of his 
opponents. He was 27 over par, and at that rate the man who had shot a 68 at 
Lakewood was headed for an unspeakable 124. 
</P>
<P>
His opponents' initial jubilation over the Author's malfunctioning had receded, 
after a few holes, into silence. It was permissible to jeer at a man's 
occasional blunder, but not at his utter collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got something wrong with you," said the Bartender. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not yourself," said the Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
"You ought to go and see a doctor," said the Wing Commander. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys sound like my wife," the Author replied. He invoked the cliche of 
every unhappy golfer. "Maybe I'll do better on the back nine." 
</P>
<P>
They shook their heads. "We don't want to play the back nine hitting the ball 
and dragging Louie," said the Bartender. 
</P>
<P>
Hizzoner, conditioned by years on the bench to issuing judgments, issued a 
judgment. "You're in no shape to go on," he ruled. "Get in my cart and I'll 
take you to the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Author, impressed that no one had suggested that he pay off on the 
front-nine Nassaus he had so disastrously lost, reluctantly gave in. When he 
drove off to his doctor's office, he could barely depress the clutch with his 
left leg. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor tested the Author's knee with a rubber mallet and got no more 
response than if he had whacked a wooden leg. He asked if the Author had 
injured his head and was told about the fall in the shower. He gave his patient 
a CAT scan and shook his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"The left side of your body isn't functioning," he said. "You have a massive 
subdural hematoma. That's a blood clot on your brain, and, from the size of it, 
you've had it for weeks. We're going to wheel you over to the hospital for 
immediate surgery. Quite frankly, you're entitled to be dead." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'll be damned," said the Author, "So that's what screwed up my golf 
swing!" 
</P>
<P>
IN HIS FIRST TIME EVER in a hospital, they operated on him twice in three days. 
First, they removed the giant blood clot. Then they went in again to maneuver 
his displaced brain lobe back into the space left by the clot. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually the brain just springs back when a clot is removed," the surgeon wryly 
observed. "But you have a stubborn brain." 
</P>
<P>
"I can testify to that," said the Author's wife. 
</P>
<P>
His golfing brothers sent him a round-robin get-well card. "Hurry back," it 
said. "We need your money." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the surgery, he rejoined them at Los Alamitos. He displayed 
the two deep indentations the operation had left in his right forehead and 
demanded extra strokes for his brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"You just had head surgery," said the Wing Commander. "Anyone who would neglect 
a blood clot for five weeks doesn't have a brain." 
</P>
<P>
On the first tee he drilled his drive more than 200 yards. He finished with an 
86 and lost only $18. "Anyone who would take money from a brain-damaged 
golfer," he said as he paid up, "would snatch Twinkies from a child." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, there occurred a second miracle. The planets aligned 
themselves properly, his neurological system functioned as it had long ago at 
Lakewood and the Author was blessed with a Day When Everything Went Right. 
</P>
<P>
By the 17th tee he had closed out the four Samaritans and was only 4 over par. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey!" said the Author. "If I can par 17 and 18, I'll have a 74. A 74! That 
means I would . . . Shoot My Age!" To shoot one's age -- or less -- is the 
addict's impossible dream, rarer than a hole-in-one. No one in the fivesome had 
even come close. 
</P>
<P>
The Author grew tense at the prospect. "I hope I don't bogey No. 17," he 
fretted. "Then I'd have to birdie the 18th." 
</P>
<P>
"Not necessarily," said the Bartender. "You could just sit on the 18th tee 
until you're a year older. Then you'd only have to shoot a 75." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of guy who would do it, too," said the Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
"That wouldn't be legal," Hizzoner ruled. 
</P>
<P>
"Quiet on the tee," the Author ordered. With his jaw set firmly, his eyes 
steely and his brain unclotted, he parred in and Shot His Age. Yo! 
</P>
<P>
That night he replayed the round, stroke by stroke, for his patient wife. He 
finally got down to the crucial last putt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was at least 3 feet, with a left-to-right break," he said. "A 
once-in-a-lifetime chance. The pressure was unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
"When I lined it up, a strange thing happened, and I still can't believe it. 
Nobody coughed, or whispered, or even moved. Nobody! 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he marveled. "I think those four guys were pulling for me."

A WINTER PALETTE; 
</P>
<P>
SUCCULENTS PROVIDE BRILLIANT COLOR DURING THE COLDEST MONTHS, USUALLY THE 
DREARIEST TIME IN THE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
WHEN THE garden is most bleak -- in December, January and February -- many 
succulents burst into flower or turn shades of orange and red like the leaves 
of autumn (though their fleshy leaves don't fall off). Succulents blossom 
because winter is the rainy season, when these water-thrifty plants can afford 
the great energy expenditure needed for flowers; their leaves turn color as a 
defense against the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Walker, a retired ichthyologist whose garden in Pacific Palisades is 
almost solely succulents, says that winter is his garden's finest season. "It 
really doesn't have a down time," Walker says. "But it looks its best from 
December through February." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the dramatic display in Walker's winter garden greets visitors 
at the front door: the genus Echeveria. In this remarkable group are a number 
of plants whose large, thick leaves turn a fiery red or orange in winter. 
Walker grows them unusually well -- and they are large. Most of his plants are 
hybrids, and many of the biggest are only about 2 years old. He has found most 
of them at local nurseries (he is especially fond of a new hybrid, 'Topsy 
Turvy'). To ensure that all energy goes to producing the leaves, Walker pinches 
back the echeverias' flowers, and every year he cuts rosettes from the stems, 
lets them dry out in the air for a few days, then re-roots them in empty pots. 
Once roots appear, he transplants them into soil. He picks a pot that is as big 
in diameter as the rosette; when the leaves overhang the sides by 2 inches, he 
moves it into a larger pot. His soil mix is simplicity itself: 1 part garden 
soil, 1 part sand, 1 part perlite and 1 part compost from his own pile. He 
fertilizes the plants several times a year. Old stems, by the way, are saved. 
Little plantlets sprout along the lengths of the old stems, and these are 
eventually severed off and rooted. 
</P>
<P>
Other, blue-green- and gray-green-leaved echeverias grow out in the garden's 
beds in mass plantings designed by Walker's wife, Mary Ev. That use of the 
succulents sets this garden apart from all others. Says Boyd Walker: "Most 
people plant succulents in natural settings, but Mary Ev found that the 
traditional English perennial border is a better model." The echeverias in the 
garden are allowed to flower, and they do so in profusion. 
</P>
<P>
There are also mass plantings of the similarly shaped Aeoniums, most of which 
are native to the Canary Islands. They enjoy the moisture of the Pacific 
Palisades air, and they don't mind the long months of overcast in the spring. 
The echeverias and the aeoniums out in the garden would grow atop tall stems if 
allowed, but they are cut from their stems yearly, left to dry and replanted. 
This keeps the ones in the garden low, neat and healthy, because rot and 
nematodes that get started in the old stems and leaves are discarded. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular flowers belong to the South African agave-like aloes, 
which bloom all winter long. 
</P>
<P>
Huge blooming crown of thorns (Euphorbia milii) makes a bright red-and-green 
backdrop for the border, and the Walkers have mixed in jade plant, another 
shrubby succulent that blooms in winter, along with clumps or colonies of other 
smaller crassulas. One unusual succulent flowering now, Bulbine stenopala, has 
spires of bright-yellow flowers arising from grass-thin fleshy leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular flowers, however, belong to the large South African group 
of agave-like aloes, which reliably bloom all winter long. "They have a very 
long season," says Walker. "Our favorites are the bicolors with red-and-yellow 
flowers. Most are hybrids developed by Dave Verity at UCLA. We use them 
everywhere." Flowers can also be orange; sometimes the spiny leaves are tinged 
orange or red. 
</P>
<P>
All of these succulent plants are tough enough to take some drought. "We water 
them fairly often -- whenever they get completely dry -- and some get watered 
weekly, right along with the lawn," Walker says. "But when we want to travel, 
we can go off and leave them for weeks and they'll still be there when we 
return. They have their advantages."

FOOD &amp; WINE: TAMING WILD MUSHROOMS WESTERN SUPPLIERS ARE DOMESTICATING 
EXOTIC VARIETIES FOR A GROWING MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Syndicate.

<P>
BRINGING HOME mushrooms used to mean getting up in the dark and tramping for 
miles through damp, quiet woods looking for the one perfect green grove where 
they grew. Their earthy smells and flavors, rich, dark and slightly musty, were 
known only by the privileged few who could find them. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, though, mycophiles need only visit the grocery store. Exotic 
mushrooms, once found only in the wild, are now grown commercially and are as 
common as fresh herbs and baby vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the only mushroom available in Ralphs stores was the 
white-button variety (known as Agaricus campestris). This year, the chain 
expects to sell 7,000 to 10,000 pounds of fresh shiitake mushrooms. Ralphs also 
stocks oyster, enoki, crimini and hon shimeji mushrooms and chanterelles. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the chanterelles, no longer are these mushrooms wild but rather wild 
varieties now cultivated commercially. Growing them is a complicated procedure 
that depends on temperature, moisture, soil type, habitat and spore management. 
The right combination of factors is so elusive that, after centuries of trying, 
the most prized wild mushroom, boletus edulis (called cepes in France and 
porcini in Italian), has not been successfully grown. 
</P>
<P>
Most cultivated mushrooms come from one supplier, Russ Hauptmann of 
Watsonville's Monterey Mushrooms. The country's largest grower of mushrooms, 
Monterey concentrates on Agaricus -- the familiar button type -- but two years 
ago began distributing oyster, shiitake and enoki varieties from commercial 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hammond, of Hazel Dell, is one of Hauptmann's suppliers. He farms enoki, 
oyster and shiitake mushrooms in two Watsonville warehouses. The mushrooms are 
cultivated in plastic bags filled with sawdust or straw mixed with rice or 
wheat bran. The bags are inoculated with the fungus mycellium -- a feathery 
kind of mushroom "root" -- then left to colonize for 5 to 15 weeks. Once the 
crop begins to grow, the plastic is removed to let the mushrooms mature. 
</P>
<P>
Truly wild mushrooms come from operators such as Matt Briggs of Cascade 
Mushrooms in Portland, Ore. Briggs contracts with pickers all over the country 
who scour their local woods for fungi. Briggs buys and sells chanterelles, 
morels, boletes, American truffles and black trumpets, as well as more exotic 
mushrooms such as cauliflower, hedgehog, bear's head, lobster, coral and 
blewits. 
</P>
<P>
Commercially available mushrooms receive mixed reviews from chefs. Mark Peel of 
Campanile likes oyster mushrooms. He sautes them over very high heat and serves 
them over salmon with summer vegetables. Peel cautions not to serve oyster 
mushrooms raw because they're "bitter and tannic." 
</P>
<P>
Patina's Joachim Splichal roasts oyster mushrooms with garlic and butter to 
use, with roasted potatoes, as a garnish for chicken salad. One of his favorite 
cultivated mushrooms is the regular white Agaricus, which he roasts with garlic 
and parsley, purees and pipes into mini-turnips. But he is downright vehement 
about enoki mushrooms: "They have nothing to do with flavor; they're just 
window dressing." He also thinks shiitakes are overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Leonard Schwartz of 72 Market Street and the new Maple Drive 
considers the shiitake the "best all-purpose mushroom in the world. It delivers 
the most flavor for the money spent." He uses shiitakes in this wintry salad of 
scallops with apples and almonds. "Scallops," he says, "have an inherent 
sweetness that complements the woodsy, smoky quality of the shiitakes." 
</P>

BALZER ON WINE: SCHRAMSBERG'S 25TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEXT MONTH, SCHRAMSBERG Vineyards Co. will celebrate its 25th anniversary, and 
it's a time of reflection for owners Jamie and Jack Davies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Jamie and Jack decided that this forest-surrounded Napa Valley 
hillside was ideal for the classic champagne varieties Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir. Here, in the clearings of tangled wildwood and scrub oak, wine maker 
Jacob Schram had established his first vines in 1862, as recorded in 1880 by 
Robert Lewis Stevenson in "Silverado Squatters": "One corner of land after 
another is tried with one kind of grape after another. Those lodes and pockets 
of earth, more precious than the precious ores, that yield inimitable fragrance 
and soft fire; those virtuous Bonanzas, where the soil has sublimated under sun 
and stars to something finer, and the wine is bottled poetry." 
</P>
<P>
After Schram died in the early 1900s, no wine was made successfully here until 
the Davieses appeared on the scene. The first Schramsberg Napa Valley 
Champagnes were greeted with acclaim in 1972. That year, President Nixon opted 
to take Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs 1969 as the toasting wine for the banquet 
in Beijing with Chinese Premier Chou En-lai that signaled new U.S. relations 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first California wine to achieve international significance. Since 
then, it has been used as a toasting wine at other summits and has been served 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
My first visit to Schramsberg was in 1968, and I found it to be a veritable 
repeat of Stevenson's experience 88 years earlier."I tasted all. I tasted every 
variety and shade of Schramberger." 
</P>
<P>
Like Stevenson, "I tasted all." And still do . . . with increasing admiration 
for its growing perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseurs know of the special cachet that is Schramsberg Napa Valley 
Champagne. Prestigous best describes this California heritage in sparkling 
wine: Blanc de Blancs 1984 Late Disgorged ($23.25); Blanc de Blancs 1985 and 
1986 ($19.40 each); Cuvee de Pinot-Brut Rose 1987 ($18.85); Blanc de Noirs 1983 
($20.85); Reserve 1982 ($27.95); Blanc de Noirs 1982 Late Disgorged ($24.95); 
Cremant Demi-Sec ($18.85). Robert Lawrence Balzer

TWO SUMMERS AGO, while on a return visit to her home country, Annika Bogart 
Elias decided to import Swedish furniture. "I fell in love with a beautiful 
hand-painted armoire dated 1718," she says by way of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
She named her Melrose shop after Karl XII, a much-admired king of Sweden, and 
began specializing in Swedish Neoclassical and Empire furnishings. Her small 
shop houses couches with scrolled arms, cabinets with symmetrical silhouettes 
and decorative accessories. 
</P>
<P>
(Prices range from $500 for a circa 1890 wicker chair and fly upwards to 
$14,000 for a Swedish Baroque fruitwood armoire. Beautiful pillows made from 
old Aubusson tapestries are $1,500 each.) Right next door -- the juxtaposition 
was a lucky coincidence -- is another smorgasbord of Scandinavian design, an 
emporium mostly specializing in modern Swedish design called Lief (pronounced 
life). Its country/traditional hand-painted furnishings "recall meadows and 
legacies," lyricizes Lief Aarestrup, the store's owner. He carries a 
contemporary Danish kitchen, award-winning indoor and outdoor furniture, 
colorful hand-blocked fabrics, flooring and old pine armoires and cupboards 
from Swedish farmhouses (1880 to 1940). Table-top accessories include 
hand-woven linens, utensils and glassware. The textiles woven of paper twine 
from Finland are remarkable.

Where will John Conboy take "Santa Barbara"? 
</P>
<P>
The former exec producer of "Capitol" and producer of "The Young &amp; the 
Restless" and "Love Is a Many Splendored Thing" has been at work unofficially 
at "SB" for several days in the newly created post of senior exec producer. 
</P>
<P>
But he tells us it's too soon for a definite game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a little early for me to make some judgmental comments on 
where I'm going with the show," Conboy said, "because I'm just getting to know 
the people and meet them." 
</P>
<P>
Conboy did reveal that the characters of Cruz (played by A Martinez) and Eden 
(Marcy Walker) will get back together romantically, possibly on an exotic 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"SB" has been a perennial Emmy winner -- eight last June, including best 
daytime drama -- but a ratings flop. NBC and New World Prod. began working out 
a deal last September to lure Conboy to the soap; he'll take over officially 
later this month. SI Sue Facter

OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF ...KATHARINE HOUGHTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mary Helen Berg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When actress Katharine Houghton made her much-publicized 1967 screen debut in 
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," some critics likened her looks and promise to 
her co-star and illustrious aunt, Katharine Hepburn, who won a best-actress 
Oscar for her work in the film. (Other critics questioned the casting.) But 
looks, talent and connections weren't enough to cement Houghton's Hollywood 
star. She's had small parts in only a smattering of feature films since, most 
recently "Mr. North" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Houghton, now 44, thinks her type -- smart, strong, independent -- went out of 
fashion in Hollywood. So she found a home on stage -- appearing in more than 50 
regional productions over 12 years -- and did some TV. In 1982, she settled in 
Manhattan and returned to her first love -- writing. 
</P>
<P>
One acts, children's plays, musicals and full-length drama, Houghton has 
written them all, with nine Off-Broadway and regional productions to her 
credit. In the early '80s, she penned and starred in "To Heaven in a Swing," a 
one-woman show based on the writings of Louisa May Alcott. Her one-act comedy, 
"Buddha," exploring a psychological power struggle between a man and a woman, 
was included among the "The Best Short Plays of 1988" (Schilton Books). 
Recently, she's been going through proofs of "M.H.G.," the biography she's 
written on her mother, historian, author and labor activist Marion Hepburn 
Grant, due out shortly. 
</P>
<P>
She's also trying her hand at screenwriting, having just finished her second 
screenplay, a story of troubled love with a strong central woman's role. 
</P>
<P>
"I do like to write about women," she said, contending that the psychology and 
relationships of women are too rarely explored. "I think women are 
fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
As for actress Houghton, recent roles include three appearances as a 
19th-Century ghost on ABC's "One Life to Live" and a minor part in "Our Town" 
on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
She seems to have accepted being "unfashionable." The former Sarah Lawrence 
College philosophy major feels that artists must be prepared for criticism and 
rejection because "what is condemned by the critics of today can become the 
classics of tomorrow." Mary Helen Berg

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: DAME MARGOT DOUBLES ON 'GREAT PERFORMANCES,' VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not unusual, says veteran television producer Jac Venza, for programs seen 
on his highly successful series, "Great Performances," to appear on the 
home-video market up to six months before they are seen on the PBS series. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point: the 90-minute video biography, "The Margot Fonteyn Story," due 
on PBS Feb. 16, which has been available since early fall in the Home Vision 
fine-arts video catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
There is no conflict here, Venza says. "We are partners with the people who 
produce programs like this biography, which was funded mostly in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be honest. We in public broadcasting are tremendously underfinanced. 
And, in the present climate of government support in this country, we ("Great 
Performances," funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and 
the National Endowment for the Arts) can seldom find more than 50% funding for 
any new project. We depend on others to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Those who buy home-video products and those who watch PBS, Venza says, are 
often the same people. Or should be. "Our job at 'Great Performances' is to get 
the arts out to people. Any way we can do that makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Forbes, a spokesman for PBS in New York City, confirmed that there never 
has been exclusivity between PBS shows and video products. "It's what happens. 
There's nothing shady about it, it's just a fact," Forbes said, referring to 
films and other cultural programming appearing almost simultaneously in stores 
and on television. He added, "Of course, it takes longer to get things into the 
stores than on the air, so they may turn up earlier in the stores. But it works 
both ways . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Produced and directed by Patricia Foy, the program tells the story of Dame 
Margot's career in performance clips and in interviews with the legendary 
ballerina (just before her 70th birthday, last May). Also in interviews with, 
among others, Ninette de Valois, Rudolf Nureyev, Sir Robert Helpmann and 
Frederick Ashton. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for PBS said that the "Great Performances" series had aired 
programs that were previously available on the home-video market. 
</P>
<P>
COMPOSERS: Sir Michael Tippett, who celebrated his 85th birthday Jan. 2, has 
spent much time in the United States this season. In October, he attended the 
world premiere of his latest opera, "New Year," in Houston. Then, at the 
beginning of this month, the British composer was feted in a weeklong 
celebration by the Pittsburgh Symphony, during which his "A Mask of Time," for 
voices and instruments, was given three times under the direction of Andrew 
Davis. And four times last week, the San Francisco Symphony gave the world 
premiere of a full-orchestra suite from "New Year," led by guest conductor 
Muhai Tang. Tippett attended the Bay Area performances. . . . Performances of 
specially commissioned works by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and Ned Rorem are 
scheduled during the 18th summer season of the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, 
July 8-Aug. 20. . . . Major works by Lukas Foss, Andrzej Panufnik, Toru 
Takemitsu, Ned Rorem, Rodion Shchedrin, Sir Michael Tippett, John Corigliano 
and Robert Beaser "will be given by the Chicago Symphony during this and next 
(1990-91) season. All these works have been commissioned by the orchestra 
through a number of funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
AND OTHER PEOPLE: Dennis Russell Davies has been named to head both the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Brooklyn Philharmonic. The 45-year-old 
conductor will take up his new positions in 1991. This spring Davies tours with 
the Orchestra of the Beethovenhalle Bonn in the ensemble's first cross-country 
United States visit, a tour that reaches Las Vegas March 26, Palm Desert March 
28, Santa Barbara March 29, Costa Mesa March 30 and El Camino College March 31. 
. . . Barry Glass, artistic director of the Aman Folk Ensemble, will lead a 
workshop at the Carlisle Project in Pennsylvania Jan. 17-22. In its fifth year 
of providing a national program, the Carlisle Project will host six 
choreographers and 30 dancers at this year's workshop, which inaugurates a 
European folk dance workshop. . . . Matthew A. Epstein has been appointed 
consultant for special artistic projects at San Francisco Opera.

Based on the Whitman poem, "The Wound Dresser" is a vividly atmospheric piece, 
with stunning orchestral touches supporting the arching, aching, yet 
understated vocal line. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvan supplies dignity and clarity, with well-balanced accompaniment from the 
composer. "Fearful Symmetries" is equally deftly scored, but in the cause of a 
relentless pop parody. It swiftly outlasts its welcome, though the disc as a 
whole lasts only a stingy 47 minutes. John Henken

CBS Records Masterworks MK 44981 (compact disc). These 15 ("Terra e Mare" is 
sung in two versions) rare and lovely songs find Domingo in his most relaxed 
good voice. 
</P>
<P>
The tessitura, gratefully low most of the time, enables him to lavish his 
burnished sound and expert projection of the texts on the charming music. Five 
of the songs are recorded here for the first time. Opera buffs will delight in 
hearing what was to become "Donna non vidi mai" ("Manon Lescaut") in "Mentia 
L'Avviso," as well as the "Boheme" quartet in "Sole e Amore." One oddity is the 
"Vexilla" which contains jolting quotes from Mascagni's "Cavalleria," 
unexplained in the otherwise excellent notes. The only blemish on the recording 
is the woolly, strained bass of Diaz in the duet. Rudel affords expert 
accompaniments. WALTER PRICE

Conductors are lining up to record Carl Nielsen's orchestral music now, and the 
attraction is not hard to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen offers the wide-ranging, crowd-pleasing emotional gamut and sonic 
glitter of the most popular late-Romantic and nationalist composers, yet seems 
adventurous in the bargain -- Tchaikovsky without the apologies. Salonen 
stresses the immediacy of "The Four Temperments" Symphony and the kinetic 
flamboyance of "Aladdin," exploiting the able services of the lean-sounding, 
hard-hitting Swedes to the maximum. The pacing is swift, the textures clear, 
and the musical/psychological contrasts almost brutal. JOHN HENKEN

TRACING THE DIRECTIONS OF GAY THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Probably the main reason theaters exist to do plays in which lesbian and gay 
characters are central is that theaters such as the Mark Taper Forum do not do 
such plays. 
</P>
<P>
While the Taper touts its commitment to social issues such as prejudice, it has 
consistently chosen to present only plays in which homosexual characters are 
marginal, when they appear at all. 
</P>
<P>
Significant plays in which the issue of homosexuality is central -- such as "As 
Is," "The Normal Heart," "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove," "Torch Song Trilogy," 
"Bent" and "Kingfish" -- all managed to escape the Taper's notice. Even South 
Coast Repertory produced "Breaking the Code" and "Cloud Nine," despite the 
severe homophobia which infects Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with the Taper's record, in which only plays such as "Fifth of 
July" and "The Colored Museum" included gay characters. 
</P>
<P>
DAVID LINK, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
A third Taper play that included a gay character was the three-character "Burn 
This."

TRACING THE DIRECTIONS OF GAY THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loynd's article was sorely myopic and narrow-minded. Singling out gay theater 
as "little seen" implies that theater is an art form seen by the masses. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who has worked in a variety of theaters (straight and gay) for 15 
years, I can swear to that not being the case. 
</P>
<P>
Loynd obviously thinks that gay theater would be better theater if it was 
performed for straight audiences. Would he say that black theater should be 
performed for white audiences? Hispanic theater for black audiences? 
</P>
<P>
I've always thought the magic of theater is not what happens on stage, but what 
happens in the audience. Gay and lesbian theater's pure magic of joining 
together with one's own people is something mainline theater can never hope to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
The very act of gays and lesbians going to a theater together and being in the 
majority is part of the reason that the audiences of "little seen" gay theater 
often travel hundreds of miles just to see a production.

TRACING THE DIRECTIONS OF GAY THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Loynd's Jan. 7 article asks where does gay theater go from here. The answer 
is: In all directions, because of its diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Gay theater is liberating for all involved. It creates a supportive community 
for talented gay and lesbian playwrights, performers and theater folk and 
straights who share our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Gay theater is where a 50-year-old lesbian can see two women embrace on stage 
for the first exciting time. It is survival, anger, spirit, gentleness, magic 
and love. 
</P>
<P>
It will be necessary until my lover and I can walk arm-in-arm down any street 
in Los Angeles without fear.

I recently returned from two months of working as an entertainer in Tokyo. I 
often tuned in "at any hour of the day or night" and I saw Dave Spector only 
once on television. 
</P>
<P>
His command of the language was indeed admirable, but his incredibly 
self-centered, egomaniacal attitude is pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
For him to say, in Alan Brown's article, that "people from Utah don't count" or 
that he "should have gone back and continued" his career (as if making $500,000 
in Japan is somehow not as good as making it in the United States) is 
indicative of his own "warped look at life." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Brown's article, Spector is quoted as saying that two of three other 
Americans getting wide exposure on Japanese TV are Mormons, and he adds: "Talk 
about a warped look at life."

SONY'S BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Nina Easton's Dec. 31 article "Behind the Scenes of the Big Deal," about 
Sony's purchase of Columbia Pictures: 
</P>
<P>
Sony and the Japanese have created nothing original. 
</P>
<P>
All of the famous Japanese products, from the radio to the television set to 
the videocassette recorder, were invented elsewhere. Namely, here in the United 
States. All the Japanese have done is to take already existing products and 
make them cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Columbia deal, Jon Peters, Peter Guber and the Japanese are 
taking an already existing product; only, in this case, it does not seem that 
the Japanese are making anything cheaper or better!

Help! It's the '90s already and I counted 37 guys and four gals in "The 
Eighties Taste Makers" (Dec. 24). Where are the women? Where are the women? Who 
do our young girls aspire to be like? Whom can they look to for inspiration? 
</P>
<P>
We'll have to wait (I guess) until the turn of the century to see perhaps 
Sherry Lansing represented under the show-biz executives or Beth Henley or 
Susan Seidelman under directors and writers or even Oprah Winfrey under 
television or Sally Jesse Raphael under radio or TV.

FOR A PRICE, Lynn Behney of Wire Works in Riverside will train a life-size man 
to stand in front of your house with his hand raised in a waving gesture. Or 
she'll make you a galloping horse, a small dog or just about anything else 
you'd like to see in topiary. 
</P>
<P>
Behney, a former sculptor, converted her talents to this garden art and now 
makes elaborate structures using poultry netting, wire and a pair of wire 
cutters. The shrubbery then grows through the spaces and is kept clipped to the 
contours. 
</P>
<P>
Garden possibilities include not only people and animal forms but abstracts and 
functioning fountains. Apartment dwellers are by no means eliminated from the 
action. For patios and balconies, she creates potted creatures that range from 
a 12-inch baby bear ($60) to a 4-foot kangaroo ($175). She also makes 
elephants, frogs, mice and pagodas. 
</P>
<P>
It's a little less expensive to buy only the frame. A mouse structure, for 
instance, is $95. Planted and potted, it would sell for $120. Behney also fills 
custom orders.

ROGER SIMON: AN ENCOUNTER WITH A REAL '60S-ERA RADICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saul Alinsky had only a few months to live when I met him. His skin was as gray 
and shiny as his suit. His shirt was rumpled. His tie was thin and gray and 
years out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
He looked as if he had wandered off the set of a gangster movie. If he had not 
been the guest speaker, he never would have gotten on the grounds of the 
exclusive prep school on Chicago's North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1972 and Alinsky was a famous radical. But he was not the tie-dyed kind 
of radical who lived on college campuses and the nightly news. He looked like 
the real goods: gritty and urban with a tough guy's sneer. 
</P>
<P>
Forgotten for nearly two decades, Alinsky is hot again now. A new biography by 
Sanford D. Horwitt, which is 595 pages long and took 10 years to write, is 
being well-received. The New Republic devoted a seven-page review to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Alinsky's contribution," the reviewer wrote, "was to reverse the logic of 
Progressive-style reform, by wrestling control away from the professional 
do-gooders and handing it over to the people they were supposed to help." 
</P>
<P>
The kids at the prep school did not know that. I, a beginning reporter for a 
suburban paper, did not know that. We only knew Saul Alinsky was a famous 
radical. One who had passed up an even bigger fee for this evening -- being any 
kind of radical, even a 61-year-old one, could still be lucrative in 1972 -- 
because he wanted to talk to high school kids. 
</P>
<P>
But he seemed a little distracted. He had a cold. And every now and then during 
his speech, he would lapse into a moment of silence. He talked about his work, 
organizing the tough Back of the Yards neighborhood in Chicago, fighting 
Eastman Kodak in Rochester, N.Y., and training Cesar Chavez for his farm worker 
battles in California. 
</P>
<P>
Alinsky explained how you did it: If garbage was not picked up in a 
neighborhood, you didn't picket. You drove a truck to the alderman's house and 
dumped the garbage on his lawn. If there were rats in buildings, you didn't 
pass around a petition. You gathered up the rats and brought them down to city 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
He had done both of those things. And he had a simple motto to explain his 
tactics. "If the end doesn't justify the means," he said, "what the hell does?" 
</P>
<P>
He ended his speech and took questions. "Ask me anything," he said. "I'll tell 
you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The kids thought they were into radicalism, organizing, reform. The children of 
the upper- and upper-middle class, they fancied themselves the next wave of 
social consciousness in America. (It is likely that many of them today express 
this by buying unbleached filters for their coffee makers and using diaper 
services so as not to clog landfills with Pampers. I am being unfair. But 
accurate.) 
</P>
<P>
A pretty, long-haired girl sitting in the second row, raised her hand and asked 
a question. I forget what it was. Alinsky paused, mumbled a reply and paused 
again. He looked at the girl very hard and asked: "Where are you from?" 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where in Philadelphia?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Well, actually the suburbs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Which suburb?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The kids began to stir, giggle. What was all this about? 
</P>
<P>
The girl named the suburb. 
</P>
<P>
"What does your father do?" Alinsky asked. 
</P>
<P>
He's an electrical engineer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"What's his last name?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The kids grew uneasy. Was this some kind of joke? 
</P>
<P>
The girl told Alinsky her last name. 
</P>
<P>
"Spell it," he commanded. 
</P>
<P>
Why? she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think?" he shot back. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know, she said and paused, but I don't think it would be for a bad 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
Alinsky smiled a little sadly, looked down at the lectern and seemed surprised 
to find himself gripping it so hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that I . . . responded to you," he said, stammering slightly. "When 
I was in college, my first wife . . . she died later . . . well, she looked 
just like you." 
</P>
<P>
The kids were silent now. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have invented some reason," Alinsky said, still looking down at the 
lectern. "But I told you everything I said tonight would be the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, I interviewed him. I wanted to ask him about the girl and his first 
wife and why he was so sad, but I didn't have the nerve. Instead, I asked him 
about the '60s and radicalism and the dangerous times he had lived through. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Aw, what the hell," he said. "Nobody gets out of life alive 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Good to his word, he died a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
So Alinsky did not live through the "Me Decade" or into the "Greed Decade." But 
I doubt that he would have changed. 
</P>
<P>
And when I think of him, I always think of him gathering up another rat for a 
trip down to city hall and wondering about that pretty girl from Philadelphia.

ZAN THOMPSON: GETTING PLUGGED IN TO A LATE-NIGHT RADIO CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not inclined by taste or by biorhythm to listen to radio talk shows late 
in the night. I think I may finally have heard Larry King, but I am not at all 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
I was happy to be a guest at Mary Anita Loos' marriage to Carl von Salza and 
was in Santa Monica Canyon last weekend for a day awash with happy memories and 
shining anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
I stayed with my dear friend, Mirabe Nowell, who lives in the Riviera in 
Pacific Palisades. We have been friends since high school, and we spend our 
times together howling with laughter. We have always done that. We were those 
two silly gigglers behind you at the movies whom you wished would be pitched 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabe had a green Chevrolet that everyone drove. It was during the Depression, 
and we used to put gas in it two gallons at a time. Mirabe lived with her 
parents in the highest-up house in the Riviera, although now it is surrounded 
by other houses. Her father was a retired New York state Supreme Court judge. 
But that didn't mean we had any money. We stretched what pennies we could get 
our hands on. I have mentioned before that the gruel gets thin in big houses, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
She now lives in the house her husband built for her next door to the big house 
where we spent so much of our time when we weren't at my house. 
</P>
<P>
Now, about Larry King. 
</P>
<P>
I was sleeping in a downstairs study on a sofa bed last weekend as I didn't 
think I could make it up to Mirabe's second floor because of the prosthesis in 
my knee. We had gone with some friends of Mirabe and with Audrey Ann Marie 
Boyle, my good friend, who also lives in the Palisades, to dinner at a Mexican 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
When we got home, I toddled off to bed after Mirabe unfolded my bed and 
supplied fat down pillows and a fluffy comforter. I was sleeping like a lamb in 
the middle of the night when the radio boomed forth with a man's voice talking 
about whether or not Notre Dame was really national football champion. 
</P>
<P>
I sprang from my bed to turn it off, forgetting that Mirabe had showed me where 
the sound system controls are. I ran to the table whence the voice was coming 
and pushed or pulled every button I could see. Then, after turning on all the 
lights downstairs and shivering in the cold, I found the cord where it was 
plugged in and pulled it apart. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. The man kept right on talking. I looked at the clock. It was 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
I pattered out to the stairway through the living room and entry hall. Peaches 
all the while barked quite testily because her sleep, too, was destroyed. We 
called up to Mirabe, but she was around a corner and down a long hall with her 
door closed, and did not hear us. 
</P>
<P>
I went back and studied the snarl of cords apparently attached to the sound 
equipment. It looked like the work of a frenzied gooney bird trying to build a 
nest. I finally pulled the entire thing apart, and Larry King, if it indeed was 
Larry King, went back into the night. 
</P>
<P>
I explained my problem to Mirabe in the morning. Why didn't the radio turn off 
when I pulled out the plug? Because I was silencing the telephone answering 
machine, that's why.

A LANDMARK CHAPTER FOR BOOKSTORE; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: ACRES OF BOOKS HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR LANDMARK STATUS FOR AN 
UNUSUAL REASON -- ITS CONTENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a shrine, the Acres of Books store is rather shabby. A metal awning hangs 
over the front. Its interior decor has been likened to a large chicken coop. 
And it is stuck in the middle of a run-down block slated for eventual 
"recycling," as urban planners like to say. 
</P>
<P>
For years the threat of the wrecking ball has hovered around Acres, one of the 
most beloved used bookstores in California. There is no specific proposal to 
tear the store down, but the general prospect of bulldozers one day chewing 
their way through Acres' hallowed spaces recently propelled the 1924 Streamline 
Moderne building onto the list of structures nominated for local landmark 
status. The nomination has set city officials at odds. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists, taking an unusual approach to the landmark ordinance, 
nominated Acres not so much for its architectural style as for its contents, an 
estimated 750,000 used books that have made the cavernous, 56-year-old shop on 
Long Beach Boulevard a mecca for Southern California bibliophiles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not acres of beer, it's acres of books," emphasized city preservation 
officer Ruthann Lehrer, who insists the stucco and brick building deserves a 
place on the city's cultural heritage landmark list as a "unique and 
irreplaceable" local asset. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the region, Acres of Books is recognized as a landmark," said 
Lehrer, who also sees merit in the building's art deco style. 
</P>
<P>
"Cultural, you can't get more cultural than all these books. I think it would 
be great to help this place stay around," agreed Downey schoolteacher Julie 
Dennis as she prowled the literature aisles, clutching an armful of books 
destined for her classroom library. "I just came in to get a copy of 'The 
Pearl.' I have a new student in class and I was going to get a cheap copy and 
-- I can't resist." 
</P>
<P>
The city's planning and community development directors also agree it would be 
nice to keep Acres in town, but not with the help of a landmark designation for 
what they consider a humdrum building on a block begging for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"If that use wasn't in there, I don't believe anyone would have nominated that 
building," said Planning Director Robert Paternoster, who says the Acres of 
Books building does not pass the landmark ordinance's architectural muster. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the ones who wrote the ordinance," he added pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Director Susan Shick says it is "extraordinary" to 
propose a building as a landmark primarily because of its use. "I think it's 
been done once in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"My point has always been that if the goal of the community is to preserve 
Acres of Books, you're not going to do it by preserving the building," Shick 
said. "You're going to do it by finding a long-term home" for the shop. 
</P>
<P>
Protect the building, Shick says, and "it could be an adult bookstore in five 
years . . . You have something on the list for potential preservation that may 
not be what anyone intended." 
</P>
<P>
The city's landmark ordinance has been in existence for a decade. But it has 
only been in the past couple of years, as City Hall embraced a preservation 
ethic, that the ordinance has come into much use. One-third of the city's 60 
cultural heritage landmarks were named last year. Lehrer, the city's first 
neighborhood and preservation officer, has been on the job for only a year. 
</P>
<P>
While city agencies in the past have had a hand in the destruction of many 
distinctive old buildings as they sought to revive Long Beach's moribund 
downtown, Acres of Books is the first of the recent spate of nominations to 
encounter opposition within City Hall. "In general, their attitude has been 
very cooperative, very supportive," said Lehrer, referring to the community 
development staff. 
</P>
<P>
Moving businesses to new addresses is costly, difficult and rarely their 
salvation, she contends. "The theory of relocation as saving our cultural 
assets is really an illusion." 
</P>
<P>
Still, landmark status is no guarantee of a building's longevity. Some of the 
city's most cherished landmarks have been razed. The Cultural Heritage 
Commission can't stop demolition of a landmark, it can only delay it for up to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Jackie Smith, who helps run the family-owned bookstore, has few 
illusions that a place on the landmark list will keep the wrecking crews at bay 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to make that much difference. What it does is buy us time. 
Nothing is going to protect you if the city decides it wants your property," 
said Smith as she sat in her "aerie," a dusty, cluttered balcony that overlooks 
the shop's yawning main room, where towering stacks of homemade bookshelves 
march into dim recesses filled with volumes on everything from Seventh-day 
Adventists to ulcers to Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Smith condones city takeovers. "I think it's wrong and immoral," she 
declared flatly. 
</P>
<P>
By its very nature, Acres of Books seems almost doomed to addresses in 
potential redevelopment zones. The shop demands huge amounts of cheap space, 
13,000 square feet of it, to be exact. The late Bertram Smith, who founded the 
store in 1934, was chased from his original location on Pacific Avenue by 
redevelopment in 1964, when he carted his fruit crate bookshelves and their 
contents to their present location, the building he bought at 240 Long Beach 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to get someplace he could stay, which proved what he knew," mused 
Jackie Smith, the wife of Bertram Smith's grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who would like the building to be named a landmark, said the family 
would be willing to move if they could find affordable space. But they would 
prefer to stay where they are, she said. Unless the city were to buy the 
building, they would not have the money to buy anything else, she said. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Smith said, "I think it would be very difficult to find something 
this size or close to this size for what (the city) would pay us for this." 
</P>
<P>
She still has the letters that poured in by the thousands to protest a proposal 
to condemn the site for a high-rise office building in the early 1980s. The 
letters came from book lovers throughout California, around the nation and even 
South America and Europe. The fans were lucky, because the high-rise project 
died of its own accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths have so far not rallied their customers for landmark designation, 
but Lehrer's office has nonetheless gotten some 20 letters and calls on the 
nomination from around Southern California, all but one of them in favor of 
landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
Already approved by the Cultural Heritage Commission and the Planning 
Commission, the Acres of Books nomination must still be approved by the City 
Council. Lehrer is waiting to place the nomination before the council, hoping 
the City Hall opposition will fade. "I'm taking a more Zen attitude," she said 
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the endless aisles of the store, customers are all for making their 
haunt a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"They tear everything up in this town, all the good stuff," complained Leslie 
Perry, a Long Beach doll maker who was recently browsing for books on cloth 
dolls. "OK for progress, but where would a bookstore like this go? Certainly 
not a mall."

DUMP CLEANUP TO TAKE YEARS BUT IT'S ALREADY A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the annals of toxic waste, a barren 40 stories of trash in southeast 
Monterey Park ranks as something of a success story. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct Operating Industries Inc. dump, once considered one of the worst 
toxic hazards in the state and nation, cleaned up its act enough to win 
favorable comment in a 1988 federal study. These days, some people, with a 
straight face, even mention the possibility of someday growing plants on the 
site, sandwiched between Monterey Park and Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
However, the dump's toxic legacy runs deep. And its recovery is many decades 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency now are presenting their 
latest solution: Top the 190-acre site with an elaborate plastic cover that 
could cost $61 million to $116 million. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with an extensive system to extract and treat potentially harmful 
gases generated by the landfill, the cover would be designed to minimize 
malodorous emissions from the 30 million cubic yards of trash. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is part of a proposal that could cost as much as $300 million and 
could go on for the next 45 to 60 years, officials said. The EPA's master 
formula for treating the dump will not even be complete until 1993, said 
Shelley Sussman, a federal environmental engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"This site won't look . . . pristine," Brian Ullensvang, Sussman's engineer 
colleague, told an audience of three dozen residents at Schurr High School in 
Montebello recently. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to face a mural that covered the school cafeteria wall, with a 
colorful panoply of birds of paradise, jonquils, gladiolus in the foreground 
and verdant mountains behind. "It won't look like this." 
</P>
<P>
Later Sussman added: "Realistically, it will not be a golf course and it will 
not be a park. But that does not imply it is not safe to be in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Today, six years after closure of the controversial landfill and four years 
after the site's inclusion on the federal Superfund list, even those who were 
the most vocal opponents of the dump say the situation has improved and the 
acrid odors are not as strong. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are disappointed with the speed of the cleanup. We all would like 
it to be done yesterday," said Hank Yoshitake, the long-time leader of a 
Montebello homeowners group as he walked in his driveway a block from the site. 
"But you walk around here now and you don't smell anything very often." 
</P>
<P>
The dump's toxicity dates from the 1950s, when there was less fear of liquid 
wastes -- and fewer regulations on dumping them. Oil companies, food companies, 
aerospace industries and waste haulers disposed of a vast range of toxic 
liquids, including such potentially cancer-causing substances as vinyl 
chloride, trichloroethylene, benzene and toluene. 
</P>
<P>
At least 200 million gallons of hazardous waste were dumped by as many as 4,000 
companies, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Significant progress has been made on the most obvious problems. And now, when 
concerned citizens assemble to hear the latest federal briefing, as they did 10 
days ago in Montebello, they tend to look back almost nostalgically. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in the meeting at the school, Leland T. Saito recalled that as a 
boy 25 years ago, he and his buddies would go down into the bottom of the dump, 
then little more than a deep garbage pit near their homes, and shoot birds with 
slingshots. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he pointed out, the dump is a substantial hillock, rising 150 to 250 
feet above the landscape and appearing as a natural land formation to 
passers-by on the Pomona Freeway. It is so large now, residents say, that 
television reception has been fouled because the dump's height blocks signals 
to the area behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Montebello Councilman William Molinari walked up and told the story of a man 
who lit his fireplace in the early 1980s. The entire hearth, he said, became 
ringed with a Bunsen burner-like flame because methane gas had apparently 
filtered underground from the dump and seeped into his house. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Kiang joined the two men, and described house hunting in Montebello 
around the same time. He said the stench assaulted his nose when he rolled down 
his car window. He decided to settle a good distance away in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The men recalled a series of Monterey Park and Montebello City Council meetings 
that were marked by one angry debate after another during the 1970s and early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite possible $1,000-a-day fines and heavy criticism from state health and 
air quality officials, dump operators in 1981 defied orders to temporarily shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
EPA Regional Administrator Daniel McGovern has called it "one of the most 
complex and contaminated sites in the nation." The site is one of four in Los 
Angeles County and among 91 in the state on the federal government's list of 
more than 1,200 Superfund locations. Last year, in a federal court agreement, 
more than 110 companies agreed to pay $65 million for the dump's cleanup. The 
companies included some of the nation's biggest: Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, 
Exxon USA, McDonnell Douglas, Union Oil, Occidental Petroleum and Times Mirror 
Co., parent firm of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Since the agreement, cleanup efforts have intensified and about 60 of the firms 
formed a company called CURE, Coalition Undertaking Remedial Efforts, to 
oversee their end of the bargain. As many as 75 people work at the landfill 
daily. Another 15 to 20 off-site employees, including federal environmental 
officials in San Francisco, work full time on the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual attempt to find other companies that contributed to the 
contamination, the EPA last year ran newspaper ads headlined "Ever Worked 
Here?" Listing 51 companies, the ad solicited information from workers and 
former workers of firms that might have dumped hazardous wastes at the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, companies that dump hazardous waste, even if they did so 
legally, still bear responsibility for helping to remedy problems related to 
the wastes. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill has even played a role in elections. Gov. George Deukmejian, under 
attack for generous political contributions from landfill companies, 
acknowledged in 1986 that the dump's owners, Mike Harabedian, Jack Arakelian 
and Tim Agajanian had been "friends of mine for a long, long time." But, the 
governor said, he had never discussed landfill operations with them. 
</P>
<P>
Today, trailers at the dump are the headquarters of cleanup crews composed of 
consultants, contractors and federal officials. In September, the EPA set up 
sampling stations at the dump and at locations in the surrounding neighborhood, 
where air is regularly tested for contaminants. Significant results will not be 
available until next year 
</P>
<P>
Also in September, workers began to dig 25 wells around the dump's perimeter 
and in selected sites in the surrounding neighborhood to test for possible 
ground water contamination. 
</P>
<P>
All the activity does little to reassure Monterey Park resident Phyllis Rabins, 
however. "I'm frustrated still. Some nights I still wake up, coughing at 2, 3, 
4 o'clock in the morning. The methane gas is so strong I have a hard time 
breathing. My quarrel has always been that they are not moving fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
But Hank Yoshitake said the neighborhoods surrounding the dump are beginning to 
turn around. 
</P>
<P>
"People are fixing up their homes now. Houses are selling for $300,000, 
$350,000. Kids are playing outdoors again. There are areas where it's still 
going to smell, particularly when they drill to do tests. But if you're sick 
and the doctor has to give you a shot, it's going to hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From the day the dump closed in 1984, we knew it would get better. For a long 
time this dump had been giving us headaches, figuratively and literally. But 
that's all over with now, thank God." 
</P>
<P>

FIRED OFFICER SETTLES HIS SUIT AGAINST CITY; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: THE OFFICER SAID HIS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED AFTER 
REPORTING A CITY COUNCILMAN WAS SEEN WITH A PROSTITUTE.

<P>
A settlement has been reached between the city and a police officer who had 
charged that his civil rights were violated when he was fired in 1987 after he 
reported that a city councilman had been seen with a known prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was settled last Thursday as a federal jury was to begin hearing 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were sealed by U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi, 
and the parties in the case would not comment. The officer, Richard Rice, 
previously had rejected a city offer of $50,000, saying he was seeking $100,000 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Rice filed the federal complaint in September, 1988, against the city of Bell 
Gardens, City Manager Claude Booker, then-Assistant City Manager Maria Aguirre 
and Police Chief William Donohoe. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was placed on administrative leave, then fired, after he filed a police 
report stating that an officer under his command saw a known prostitute get 
into Councilman Roger McComas' motor home. 
</P>
<P>
He was reinstated, with full back pay, in March, 1989, after a Superior Court 
judge ruled that Rice had been improperly dismissed, and an appellate court 
upheld the decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the Superior Court hearing, Chief Donohoe said Rice was fired because he 
lied in talking with the president of the local police union about the police 
report on the councilman. The judge said, however, that there was no proof of 
such a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
When news reports of the McComas incident first were published, the councilman 
called the report as a "big, made-up story." 
</P>
<P>
McComas, who last spring became mayor of Bell Gardens, later acknowledged that 
he picked up a known prostitute "for the heck of it," but said he did not 
solicit or have sex with her, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office in May, 1987, decided not to prosecute McComas 
for soliciting prostitution, saying there was not enough evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The incident first was reported by Officer Joe Marquez, who said he saw a known 
prostitute run up to McComas' motor home at a tavern on Eastern Avenue. The 
woman, Marquez reported, opened the passenger door and climbed in. 
</P>
<P>
After a trip around the block, Marquez reported, the motor home stopped again 
just outside the bar, and the woman got out. Marquez then questioned the woman, 
who told him the driver was a "regular customer" who used an alias, according 
to the police report. The woman said the driver gave her money "not to tell the 
police what we do or to mention the motor home," Marquez reported. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the settlement, Rice said he believed he was entitled to 
more than regaining his job, with back pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unemployed for 12 months," Rice said "I had a lot of time to think about 
this. There's been a lot of depression, anger and resentment at what people 
tried to get away with. They seem to do what they want, when they want, and I 
want to keep that from happening again."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOW YOU CAN USE A HOUSE AS BOTH RESIDENCE AND HANDY TAX 
SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We recently purchased our first home. It is a fixer-upper that we 
plan to gradually upgrade as we have the funds available. Can we deduct our 
repair and fix-up costs? 
</P>
<P>
Please clarify deductions for insurance, depreciation, property taxes and 
mortgage interest. We already know we made a profit, as we bought the house at 
least 25% below what comparable nearby homes were selling for. 
</P>
<P>
It took us over three months to wear the seller down and get him to sell to us 
for just 10% down. He agreed to carry the first mortgage at 10% interest for 30 
years. At age 74, he knows he won't live 30 more years, but he told us his kids 
now won't be able to waste their inheritance. What are the tax advantages of 
fixing up our new home? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your careful and patient negotiation paid off in many ways. Not only 
did you obtain excellent terms at minimal cost, but you maximized your 
"acquisition mortgage" so all the interest will be tax-deductible. In addition, 
you can deduct interest on a home-equity loan up to $100,000, or on a 
home-improvement loan. 
</P>
<P>
However, your costs of repair and capital improvements are not tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
But you can add these expenses to your home's cost basis, thus reducing your 
profit when you eventually sell the house. Of course, your property taxes 
qualify as itemized deductions on your income tax returns, but the insurance 
premium is not deductible because it is a personal expense. Sorry, but you 
can't depreciate your personal residence, either. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30-Day Listing Helped Seller Find Good Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: Thank you for explaining why you list your properties for 30 days with a 
realtor who knows you will renew the listing if it expires with the home unsold 
and the agent is doing a good job. We listed our home for sale on a 30-day 
listing with an agent who is a good friend's daughter. She turned out to be a 
real dunce who failed to disclose to us she is a part-time agent and a 
full-time schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
Although this agent held one weekend open house, not one other local realty 
agent showed our home to prospective buyers. We were very unhappy. When the 
listing expired, we switched to a much better agent who found us a buyer within 
about three weeks. Many thanks for keeping us from signing a long listing. 
</P>
<P>
A: I greatly appreciate your letter. Many realtors criticize me for 
recommending 30-day listings because they want to tie up listings for 90 to 180 
days. Some even hate me for saying agents work harder, smarter and faster just 
before a listing expires. But that is the truth. 
</P>
<P>
When I was selling properties as a broker, I always told my sellers they could 
cancel their listings at any time. Fortunately, that never happened. As an 
alternative to the 30-day listing, be sure the listing agent agrees in writing 
to allow the seller to cancel the listing at any time without cause and without 
cost. If an agent refuses to agree to such a condition, the agent doesn't have 
confidence in himself/herself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Termites Work Too Slowly for Tax Loss 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently sold our home, and to our surprise, the buyer's termite 
inspector found almost $16,000 of damage, which we had to pay to have repaired. 
Fortunately, we made a large profit but this took a big chunk of it. We talked 
with our tax adviser about how to get the greatest tax benefit from this 
expense. But she wasn't very helpful. Since we bought a larger home, all the 
tax on our sale profit is deferred, so we don't have anything from which to 
deduct this large expense. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: Termite damage usually does not qualify as a casualty loss income tax 
deduction. The reason is, casualty losses must be sudden, unusual or 
unexpected. Unfortunately, termites work very slowly and take many years to do 
their damage. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of deductible casualty losses include fires, floods, thefts, 
accidents, tornadoes and earthquakes. There are a few Tax Court decisions 
allowing casualty loss deductions for termite damage, but in those cases the 
owners proved their termites worked very, very fast, causing damage in just a 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
However, you can add the cost of the termite damage repairs as a capital 
improvement to your home's adjusted cost basis, thus reducing your profit on 
which tax is deferred. I realize this will not immediately help since you are 
deferring tax by purchasing a replacement home, but this is the best I can 
recommend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consider Appreciation to Home a Bonus 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are looking for a home to purchase. Last weekend, a realty agent showed 
us a very expensive home that is way over our budget. But we enjoyed inspecting 
it. When we got to the kitchen, the agent sat us down and took out of her 
briefcase a form called "Benefits of Home Ownership." She worked out the 
benefits of buying that expensive house. The income tax savings for the 
mortgage interest and property taxes were obvious. 
</P>
<P>
But the agent also included "projected increase in market value" at a 5% annual 
rate, compounded for 10 years. We felt this was unrealistic because there have 
been some years in our area where homes did not appreciate at all. What do you 
think of projecting appreciated market value? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. I consider appreciation in market value just a bonus. As you may 
know, I recommend buying run-down, fixer-upper properties and then upgrading 
them to raise the market value. I think Mark Haroldsen was the first person to 
call this idea "forced inflation" and I like that term. But to project 
appreciation as an incentive for buying a home, in my opinion, is not a good 
idea because appreciation is totally unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only One Replacement Home Is Allowed 
</P>
<P>
Q: We plan to sell our large old home for around $350,000. Then we would like 
to buy a Florida condo for around $200,000 where we will spend our winters and 
also buy a northern home for the summers, which will cost at least $150,000. As 
we are not yet 55, will this plan work to avoid tax on our large sale profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Nice try, but I'm sorry to report only one replacement principal 
residence is allowed when using the roll-over residence replacement rule of 
Internal Revenue Code 1034. The reason is that you can have just one principal 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
If you will spend most of your time at the Florida home, it will become your 
principal residence. Should its cost not equal or exceed the net (adjusted) 
sales price of your old home, then you will owe tax on your profit up to the 
difference in the two prices. Please consult your tax adviser for further 
details. 
</P>

If You Have Bargain Rental, Stay but Buy 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our situation is unique, and I want to know if you would still recommend we 
buy a house anyway. My husband and I have a bargain rental in a very nice, 
three-bedroom apartment in a luxury complex owned by his mother. We help manage 
the 26 apartments, so that is one of the reasons our rent is so cheap. 
</P>
<P>
However, my mother-in-law is 82 and we realize she won't be around forever. 
When she dies, all her property will be divided equally among her five 
children. We presume the apartments will then be sold. But she is in excellent 
health, so we don't anticipate that happening very soon. Would you still 
recommend we buy a house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Of course, I highly recommend that you keep your bargain rental as long 
as you can. But today is a good time to buy a house where you might like to 
live someday when you eventually move out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
By purchasing a house now you will be able to get some benefits from the house 
while it is rented to tenants, such as tax loss benefits and probable long-term 
appreciation in market value. Even if you never move into that rental house, 
you will have it available in case of need, and in the meantime you will 
receive benefits from it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7-Day Limit Is Best for Home Inspection 
</P>
<P>
Q: I look forward to your sound advice. However, as a professional inspector I 
beg to differ with you about the five-day time limit you suggest for having a 
professional inspection. My firm prides itself on prompt inspections, but we 
find it very difficult to arrange for an inspection, check the necessary 
information, such as building permits and prepare a written report within less 
than a week. I think you should reconsider and recommend at least seven to 10 
days for the inspection time in a home purchase offer. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for the suggestion. Perhaps I have been spoiled by outstanding 
service from professional inspectors. But I am also thinking of the home seller 
who does not want to tie up a home while the buyer hires a professional 
inspector. 
</P>
<P>
If property appraisers can complete their appraisals in a week or less I don't 
see why professional inspectors can't also hustle to give top-quality service. 
However, I will amend my suggestion to set a seven-day time limit for a 
professional property inspection contingency in a home purchase offer.

CONDO Q&amp;A: BOARD CANDIDATE LIST KEPT SECRET UNTIL MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our association's annual election meeting took place recently. Prior 
to the election, I telephoned the management company twice to ask for the names 
of the board candidates; however, the list of candidates was not available 
until the night of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At that time I asked why the list (six candidates for five positions) was not 
sent prior to the meeting so that those who were unable to attend could vote by 
absentee ballot. The answer was that "for this type of election, absentee 
ballots are illegal in the state of California." The property manager stated 
that if members wanted to know for whom they were voting, they had to come to 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult for me to believe that each member is entitled to vote but is 
not entitled to know for whom he or she is voting. Please explain. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Most associations distribute proxy forms to all members so that if you 
are unable to attend the meeting your proxy may be counted for quorum purposes 
and, if authority is given on the proxy, your vote will be cast by another 
voting member whom you designate or an officer of the association. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that many associations do not distribute absentee ballots is that 
any member who is nominated "from the floor" at the meeting would have a 
disadvantage and would probably not be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the attorneys whom I have consulted do not recommend the use of 
absentee ballots. I believe that it would have been proper for the manager to 
have given you the names of those who were on the list of nominees when you 
requested them. This verbal disclosure would have been helpful to you if you 
were considering nominating someone or running for the board yourself.

New Board Refuses to Repair Water Pipe 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our condo complex is 17-years-old, and in the past few years a number of 
homeowners have had a water pipe break that runs under the concrete slab from 
the water heater to the kitchen sink. This requires breaking up the concrete 
slab under the kitchen floor so that he piping can be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, this work has been accepted as a "common area" repair and has been 
paid for by the association through its insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Our current board refuses to pay for these repairs. They claim that there has 
been a change in the law, which now states that a waterline used exclusively by 
an individual homeowner is not association responsibility any more, even though 
it runs underneath the concrete slab foundation of my unit. 
</P>
<P>
Are they correct? Has the law changed? 
</P>
<P>
A: Recent legislation has clarified association responsibilities and owner 
responsibilities so that if the association's declaration (CC&amp;R's) contains 
ambiguous wording or is not specific enough, the California Civil Code takes 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the portion of the California Civil Code, Section 1364 (a) which your 
board is probably referring to for guidance. The law states: 
</P>
<P>
"Unless otherwise provided in the declaration of a common interest development, 
the association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the 
common areas, other than exclusive use common areas and the owner of each 
separate interest is responsible for maintaining that separate interest and any 
exclusive use common area appurtenant to the separate interest." 
</P>
<P>
Note the important initial phrase: Unless otherwise provided in the declaration 
. . ., which means that you now must read your declaration to find out if the 
association is responsible for exclusive use common area. 
</P>
<P>
The California Civil Code, Section 1351, provides the following definition: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Exclusive use common area' means a portion of the common areas designated by 
the declaration for the exclusive use of one or more, but fewer than all, of 
the owners of the separate interests and which is or will be appurtenant to the 
separate interest of interests." 
</P>
<P>
Check with your local library or your county law library to read the entire 
section since I have only quoted portions of it. 
</P>
<P>
If you need legal advice on the meaning or interpretation of this law, I urge 
you to seek the advice of an attorney who specializes in common-interest 
development law. Since I have not had the opportunity to review your 
association's declaration, I am unable to tell you whether your board is 
correct in declining to pay for your plumbing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Reluctant to Stop Loud Music 
</P>
<P>
Q: My condo complex is having a problem with a noisy neighbor who blasts music 
all day long. I have called our security officers and the police. I have asked 
our manager to enforce our CC&amp;Rs, which specifically prohibit loud noises. 
The association has the authority to fine this neighbor, but the management 
seems to be reluctant to do so. What is my next step? 
</P>
<P>
A: Have you contacted your neighbor yourself? That may be more effective than 
going through the association. You could invite the neighbor to your unit to 
hear what you are hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if you haven't contacted your board of directors, that should be your 
next move. It is the board's responsibility to oversee enforcement of the 
CC&amp;R's. Usually, management carries out the association's enforcement 
procedures as directed by the board. 
</P>
<P>
As you have learned, calling the security officers or police will only provide 
peace and quiet for a short time. As soon as the authorities are gone, the 
volume knob is probably turned up again as you go running for the earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
The association needs to get the attention of the offending neighbor. One way 
to do this would be to send written notification of the violation, asking the 
owner to attend a hearing regarding the unacceptable noise levels. The notice 
of the hearing should also include the amount of the fine that will be levied 
if the board decides to levy a fine, what will happen if the owner does not 
attend the hearing and the procedure that will be followed if the owner 
continues to violate the rights of other owners. 
</P>
<P>
If the offending neighbor is a tenant, then the association should be notifying 
and disciplining the owner of the unit, in addition to notifying the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
If the association is unwilling to act or if the neighbor is totally 
uncooperative, you are entitled to bring suit to enforce the CC&amp;Rs or to 
simply enforce your right to peace and quiet. Consult an attorney if you are 
interested in getting a court order to prohibit the resident from playing loud 
music. I have heard of owners who used a sound engineer to measure the decibels 
of the music in order to prove that the noise coming into their unit was 
excessive.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
FHA TO RAISE CEILING ON LOANS TO HOME BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONAL FINANCE: THE INCREASE IN HOME LOANS IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN EFFECT 
FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND WILL HELP THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS QUALITY FOR A 
MORTGAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The FHA loan limit is going to be raised in many parts of the country to 
$124,875, making it possible for 100,000 more Americans -- including 20,000 
additional Californians -- to capitalize on the popular, low down payment loan 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was expected to take effect last week. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Federal Housing Administration has only been able to guarantee 
loans for a maximum of$101,250 for single-family homes in high-cost areas such 
as Southern California. In lower-cost areas, the limit has been $67,500. 
</P>
<P>
Those limits have rendered the program virtually useless in many parts of 
California, where the median price of a single-family home is nearly $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
While the revised ceiling isn't expected to spark a huge increase in 
FHA-financed deals, it's welcomed nonetheless by California's real estate 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly isn't going to solve our state's affordability problems, but 
it's a small step in the right direction," said Jim Antt Jr., a Bakersfield 
broker and president of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Antt said the higher loan limit will give an added boost to the already 
sizzling inland housing markets, such as Riverside and San Bernardino, where 
many single-family homes can still be purchased with a loan that is under the 
FHA maximum. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and other highly urbanized areas, the higher ceiling will likely 
have its biggest impact on the less-expensive condominium and townhome market. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of condos and townhouses you can get with a $124,875 loan in 
L.A. or Orange County, but it's a lot harder to find a single-family house that 
can be purchased with that size loan," Antt said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on its 1990 sales projections, CAR analysts estimate that 77,500 FHA 
sales could be made in the state this year with the higher loan ceiling. If the 
limit had stayed at $101,250, only 57,500 California homes could be purchased 
through the FHA program. 
</P>
<P>
The higher ceiling will only be in effect until the end of this year unless it 
is extended or made permanent by Congress. Although real estate experts say 
it's likely that the ceiling will stay at the $124,875 mark or eventually move 
even higher, would-be home buyers should know that the ceiling may eventually 
be lowered to $101,250, said Bill Glavin, an FHA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 17 million people have bought a home using the FHA loan program, 
which allows borrowers to make a down payment as small as 4% or 5%. The program 
requires a user fee equal to 3.8% of the loan amount, which most borrowers 
prefer to pay over 30 years instead of up-front. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all credit-worthy borrowers qualify for an FHA mortgage, as long as 
the property they're buying meets the program's basic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
FHA limits are also being raised for multi-unit dwellings, Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
The new loan limit for duplexes is $140,600. It is $170,200 for three-unit 
buildings, and $197,950 for four-unit residential complexes. 
</P>
<P>
More information about FHA loans can be obtained from mortgage and real estate 
brokers, lenders and regional offices of the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Although the increase in the FHA loan limit is good news for borrowers, a bill 
that would raise the limit much higher -- perhaps close to $200,000 for 
single-family homes in some high-priced markets -- has apparently stalled in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, part of a major housing bill introduced last year by Sens. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), would allow the FHA to insure 
loans for an amount equal to 95% of an area's median-priced home. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the government decided that an area's median-priced home is 
$200,000, the FHA could insure a loan for as much as $190,000. The more liberal 
guidelines could literally allow millions more Americans to purchase a house 
with an FHA loan, according to housing analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The bill has drawn fire from some legislators, who say the overall measure is 
too costly and that raising the FHA limit would primarily help well-heeled 
borrowers who can already qualify for a conventional loan. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, Cranston and D'Amato have lost some political support 
both in Washington and with the public over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawmakers are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee -- 
Cranston for his involvement in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan controversy, 
D'Amato for alleged influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Department during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a big crowd of congressmen rushing to support any bill that 
Cranston or D'Amato have authored right now," said one Washington insider. 
</P>
<P>
A few other bills that would raise the FHA limit higher than the new $124,875 
ceiling have also been introduced. But they, too, face an uncertain fate as an 
election-year Congress mulls a host of more pressing issues, including budget 
cuts and foreign affairs.

TIPS FOR GETTING A GOOD BUY IN GENTLER MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David W. Myers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a kinder, gentler housing market for today's home buyers: Prices are 
relatively flat, the selection of homes is good and mortgages rates are low. If 
you're looking for a new home, here are some pointers that can help you get the 
best deal: 
</P>
<P>
* Work with a good real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Find one you feel comfortable with, and work exclusively through him if he does 
a good job. "If the agent knows that you'll be loyal to him, he'll give you 
better service," said Chuck Lamb of several Century 21 offices in the San 
Fernando Valley. "Besides, if you use multiple agents, you'll probably wind up 
looking at the same properties over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
* Get "prequalified" by your agent or lender. This helps you figure out the 
size of the loan you can obtain. In turn, you won't waste time looking at homes 
you obviously can't afford. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't be afraid to drive a hard bargain. Although there's no hard-and-fast 
rule, some realtors say your first offer in a soft market should be at least 
10% or 15% below the seller's asking price. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that price isn't everything. Sellers sometimes balk at making deep 
cuts in their asking price, but think nothing of making more lucrative 
concessions -- providing favorable financing, making major repairs and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of sellers are also paying for things that the buyer usually pays for, 
like points, home inspection fees and a home warranty plan," said Linda Orr, 
owner of Real Estate Marketeers in Irvine. "I ask for the moon and work down 
from there." David W. Myers

HINTS TO HELP SELL YOUR HOME IN A BUYERS' MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David W. Myers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're thinking of selling your home now, here are some tips that will help 
you sell it faster and get the best possible price: 
</P>
<P>
* Select a good realtor. Interview at least three prospective agents that are 
active in your area and pick the one that seems to be the most professional and 
knowledgeable about your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure that your property is priced right. Ask your agent for a list 
showing the recent sales prices of homes in your area, and set your price 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Homes that are priced right are still selling," said Joan Knox, owner of J. R. 
Taylor Real Estate in Woodland Hills. "The ones that stay on the market for 
months are usually the ones that are overpriced." 
</P>
<P>
* Be flexible when it comes to showing your property. With buyers calling the 
shots in today's market, you have to play by their rules. If a buyer wants to 
drop by in the evening or early morning, try to accommodate the request. It may 
be days or even weeks before someone else is interested in the property, and 
you can't sell it if nobody sees it. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your home tidy. That means no dirty dishes in the sink, no papers on the 
floor and no fingerprints or smudges on the doors. Keep the yard 
well-manicured, consider painting the house and make those little repairs that 
you've been putting off -- like fixing that leaky faucet or mending that torn 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
* Be realistic when it comes to negotiating. Unlike a year ago, buyers are 
driving a hard bargain and you'll be expected to dicker. But if your property 
is priced appropriately, you probably won't have to knock more than 5% off your 
asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, that reducing your price is only one way to make concessions. 
You can also agree to a closing escrow date that meets the seller's needs, 
offer to help out with the financing by taking back a second mortgage or offer 
to pay some of the seller's closing costs. David W. Myers

<P>
We rented a car and hired a driver; the total cost came to half the price of a 
tour bus. At our leisure, we could stop to buy folk art in the villages and 
take pictures of casbah ruins. Also, we would investigate the beginning of the 
Sahara Desert and experience sunrise at Zagora. 
</P>
<P>
Soon we were in and out of the foothills, beginning our three-day trip. The 
landscape was much like California's High Sierra with rocky escarpments and 
pine forest. In front of us were white peaks stuck up above a tree-lined 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We were on the route of Tizi-N'Tichka ("difficult") Pass, a road that rated two 
stars in Michelin and appeared well named as we corkscrewed up the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
At 9,000-feet, the summit did not compare with the 14,000-foot peak of Jebel 
Toubkal nor even 11,000-foot Mt. Bouiblan, but we could see why skiing is 
considered a growth industry here. 
</P>
<P>
We followed surly rivers and were hit by snow flurries so dense that they 
whitened out all but the truck inching along ahead of us. We plowed past 
hamlets with names we would be unable to find later on any maps, but which all 
began with T. They were called by the locals: "big village . . . small village 
. . . new village." 
</P>
<P>
Our forward motion ended abruptly after we had taken the mountain and were only 
30 miles from Ouarzazate. The now red and angry river had crossed the road. A 
bus could lumber over like an oversized hippo, but our car could not. 
</P>
<P>
By morning, snow had closed Tizi N'Tichka Pass, and we thought about taking the 
coast road to Agadir where we might skirt the 300-mile mountain range and reach 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Water flows to Atlantic," our driver said, meaning this way was flooded. We 
took it as a sign that we should forget the desert and spend an extra night in 
Fes. We headed east. 
</P>
<P>
First we paid nearly $30 for gas, high for filling the tank of such a small car 
in a country where gas was supposedly cheap. Later we would wonder about a 
station without visible prices (most stations were similar to their U.S. 
counterparts), and where our driver and the attendant were old friends. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the High Atlas was on our right, the Middle Atlas on our left and 
we were quickly distracted by camels coaxed along by young herders and by 
snappily costumed horsemen on their way to perform in village "fantasies," 
those gallop-and-shoot spectaculars that are part of every Moroccan festival. 
</P>
<P>
Desert nomads had come, too, pitching their black, goat-hair tents in clusters 
around town commons and along the river fronts. If we could not go to the 
Sahara, perhaps the Sahara was coming to us. 
</P>
<P>
We crossed the Haduz Plain where apples, olives, lemons, oranges and apricots 
are grown. The two-lane road was straight and bordered by eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Our driver drove with one hand on the wheel, without regard for center lines. 
Oncoming trucks flashed their lights menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
Hedges of prickly-pear cactus (called "Christian fig" by the Moors) formed 
living fences around plots of land and mud houses. Here in the countryside 
people wore traditional clothes, were friendly and waved to us as we passed. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped for lunch in Khenifra and drove into the foothills of the Middle 
Atlas, past high green meadows dabbed with wild orange marigolds and 
blue-flowered borage. Traffic was minimal: A few trucks and white donkeys laden 
with twigs were honked out of the way by white-robed Arabs speeding toward 
Marrakech in their Mercedes 600s. 
</P>
<P>
Barbary apes once swung through these trees in large numbers. It is said that 
there are still descendants living in the cork forests near Meknes. Elephants 
were native too, thriving in the northern foothills where some were captured by 
Hannibal and taken to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the crenelated walls of Fes at dusk, we managed happily to get into 
the elegant Hotel Palais Jamai without reservations. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day, when our driver went home to Marrakech, Phyllis contracted 
through the hotel concierge for a taxi to Casablanca, where we caught our plane 
home. She paid the driver a tad more to go via the historic old city of 
Moulay-Idriss and the Roman ruins of Volubilis. 
</P>
<P>
International road signs, light traffic and well-maintained roads make 
self-driven cars a good way to see Morocco. It helps to have some knowledge of 
French or at least a phrase book. Buy a road map such as Michelin, examine the 
tires (including the spare) and check the oil and water before you start. 
</P>
<P>
Carry an international driver's license (available at AAA offices in the United 
States). Even when dealing with a U.S.-based rental agency, read the contract's 
small print. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to hire a car and driver, get a package agreement. Better yet, 
get a driver with his own car. Negotiate and agree on prices in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Get everything in writing (be sure your driver understands it and have him sign 
the paper). Don't be intimidated. Although hotel concierges use regular drivers 
who have proved trustworthy, have the concierge also read and sign the 
contract. If you think the rate is too high, say so. It will probably come 
down. 
</P>
<P>
If you are traveling November through April or crossing the High Atlas, get an 
advance report on weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Morocco has strict rules governing guides. Although your driver/guide may be 
quite competent to take you through a monument, he cannot do so. You must hire 
a local guide or go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
The best guides are officially licensed, wear a badge and you get them through 
your hotel. The rate is about $6 for half a day. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve a car through your travel agent for best price and availability. In 
Morocco, expect to pay $40 to $60 (depending on season and length of rental) 
per day for a small to medium stick-shift model, with unlimited mileage, plus 
gas and 19% tax. A driver will be $25 to $50 more per day. 
</P>
<P>

Tourist Office, 20 East 46th St., Suite 1201, New York 10017, (212) 557-2520.

ADVENTURE'S AFOOT AT BAREFOOT HOTELS OF ASIA

<TEXT>
<P>
One wrong turn on a short walk from one tourist spot to another and we found 
ourselves caught in a maze of back streets that seemed to double back on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sidewalks overflowed with street vendors selling shish kebabs, ginseng root, 
live monkeys and silk sarongs. Medicine men squatted in doorways and read 
fortunes in mummified horses' heads. The air vibrated with the scent of incense 
and ginger. 
</P>
<P>
We had found our way into the heart of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about the mysterious and exotic Orient. I didn't know places like this 
still existed," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish our hotel was here," my son replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello," called a female voice. "You want a room?" 
</P>
<P>
My mouth had just opened for an automatic negative response when the voice 
insisted, "Come, you have a look." 
</P>
<P>
Before us stood a young Thai woman with an ingenue's smile. She ushered us into 
a tiny restaurant that opened to the street like a sidewalk cafe. Westerners 
and Thais sipped crushed fruit drinks at the tables. 
</P>
<P>
We entered the restaurant and after walking through to the back found a 
staircase surrounded, like a stage with an audience, by a half dozen pair of 
shoes. Our hostess quickly slipped off her thongs. 
</P>
<P>
"Barefoot hotel, in respect for the spirits of the house," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
We padded upstairs in our bare feet to a small room with nothing but two large 
beds, a chair, a sink and a fan. It was strictly pension-style, except for the 
view. 
</P>
<P>
The large windows overlooked a quilt of Oriental roof gardens bursting with 
orchids and bougainvillea. The only sound was the song of caged murtabok birds 
that hummed like wind playing in a cave. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty baht, if you like," our hostess said. "Shower next door. Only six 
rooms. Very secure." 
</P>
<P>
"Can we, Dad?," my son pleaded. "Eighty baht; that's only $3." I could see he 
had already made eye contact with a shy but smiling 10-year-old Thai girl who 
had been following our progress through the hotel from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like staying with a family," he added. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of international-style hotels I had to admit I craved a break from 
elevators, Muzak, air conditioning and the plate glass that separated us from 
the countries we had flown so far to see. 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later a taxi carried us back with our luggage. Over a $1 lunch of 
shrimp fried rice our Thai hostess and her younger sisters explained that we 
had stumbled into the heart of the Banglamphu district where a grass-roots 
accommodation industry was in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
"We call these barefoot hotels 'guest houses,' " our hostess said. "Five years 
ago there was only one little hotel here. Now Kao San Road has 35 guest houses 
-- very popular with young travelers." 
</P>
<P>
That was evident from a glance around. Against the backdrop of traditional 
Oriental street scenes, backpack-toting youths strolled among the street 
vendors and lounged at tables that spread in front of restaurants like the 
tavernas of Mykonos. 
</P>
<P>
Among themselves they chatted in German, Dutch, Swedish and English with an 
Australian accent. Some spoke Thai while others used English as the lingua 
franca with Asian friends. Life seemed to move in slow motion . . . even among 
the children my son joined to play soccer in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the restaurants and guest houses of Banglamphu we never saw Westerners; 
the city absorbed them. Here, Bangkok opened to us like a blooming lotus. 
</P>
<P>
Our hostess and her sisters showed us how to bargain for silk, jewelry, 
Buddhist antiques. We learned where to catch inexpensive water taxis to escape 
Bangkok's heat and traffic and visit city shrines by boat. 
</P>
<P>
We gave alms to monks who queued up at our doorstep for a breakfast bowl of 
rice. We found absolute peace in the cloisters of a Buddhist temple. But most 
interesting of all was that we discovered how the Thais use their smiles to 
wipe away the unpleasantness in life. 
</P>
<P>
More practical travel information came our way, too. Acquaintances showed us 
how the barefoot hotel network had spread through Thailand, Malaysia, 
Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
The "Traveler's Survival Kits" published by the Lonely Planet guidebook service 
provide good anecdotal advice about thousands of barefoot accommodations 
ranging from dormitories and pensions to resort vacation homes and private 
grass shacks on a tropical beach. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the lodging cost is less than $12 a night and often it is under $5 
with a meal or two included. It has been likened, both in personal style and 
economics, to a stay in Europe's bed-and-breakfast establishments. 
</P>
<P>
With two more weeks to explore the Orient, my family and I embarked upon the 
barefoot trail using the excellent Malay and Thai railway system to ferry us 
between destinations. 
</P>
<P>
It did not matter that we arrived without reserved accommodations in Hua Hin, a 
Thai fishing village and resort. 
</P>
<P>
As the train slowed for the station, three bicycle rickshaws raced alongside. 
Their drivers screeched to a stop, dismounted and swung aboard the moving 
train, laughing at their accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Good rooms! Good rooms!," they shouted, grabbing our bags. "Beach house. Very 
cheap. OK?" 
</P>
<P>
These were not your average touts, they were high-school boys whose jolliness 
and energy put us at their mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later they rolled us up to a modern two-story resort home on a 
quiet lane one block from restaurants and the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
For $8 we had a living room, kitchen, bath of kingly proportions and two 
balconies. With no landlord on the premises, it offered privacy almost unknown 
in Asia, with a spectacular beach and a nearby outdoor market that turned 
shopping into a carnival. 
</P>
<P>
We might never have left Hua Hin except that Malaysia's Penang Island called to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
Once a crucial British colonial trading center, Penang's only city, Georgetown, 
seems architecturally and temperamentally frozen in the days when Chinese 
Tokays and turbaned Indians clogged the narrow streets and whispered promises 
of ivory, emeralds and longevity potions. 
</P>
<P>
The barefoot hotels stand at the center of the city where gold merchants, 
antique traders and silk emporiums have streets to themselves. And unlike the 
guest houses of Bangkok or the bungalows of Hua Hin, Penang's barefoot 
accommodations are small hotels, most run by Chinese families. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years these establishments have developed a reputation for housing 
"short-time" girls, so once again we found rickshaw drivers useful in leading 
us to a "barefoot" with family accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Hotel on Chulia Street offered quiet rooms, laundry service, 
breakfast for under $1, a serve-yourself beer locker, free newspapers and a 
shaded patio that seemed a crossroads for Western travelers. 
</P>
<P>
All this was within 50 yards of Indian parades, Chinese tiger dancers and a 
Mardi Gras atmosphere of food stalls and revelers painting the streets of 
Georgetown every night of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But not all of Penang's barefoot hotels are caught in the endless throb of 
Georgetown. Some, like the Southern Cliff, are on the edge of the quiet palm 
forests north of town. 
</P>
<P>
There we shared the upstairs of a beach-front restaurant with the owner Fu, his 
wife and two boys. We caught our own fish, ate family style and played majong. 
The boys gave each other English and Mandarin lessons while playing 
hide-and-seek or flying paper airplanes out the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Fu's youngest son had an expression for how our families related. "Learning 
house together," he called it. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of our stay in Southeast Asia we also "learned house together" 
with Tamil Indians in an urban bungalow and with Muslim Malays in a coastal 
stilt village. 
</P>
<P>
We learned the secrets of cooking with coconuts, curry and hot peppers. We 
learned how patience and an exceptional sense of comic irony made life a joy in 
a Muslim household with no fewer than three wives and 14 children. 
</P>
<P>
And always, of course, we learned about friendship.

CLUB MED STILL SWINGING, BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gone are the pop beads for barter at the bar, the lovable old tradition of 
bedroom doors without locks, the silly camp songs with the yahoo yells. 
</P>
<P>
Club Med, that worldwide network of sporty vacation villages, turns 40 this 
spring. It is fast shedding its swinging image and is taking on a conservative 
look. 
</P>
<P>
It now has its own credit card and gives you a room key at check in. 
</P>
<P>
It even has taken up golf. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the hills behind Cannes on the French Riviera is its newest club, Opio. 
A sprawling, 500-room, terra-cotta-colored complex with red-tile roofs, it 
reflects the current passion for golf in continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Although only nine holes (a separate 18-hole course will be constructed in the 
summer), the course is as pretty as a post card, spilling down a series of 
terraces among olive-tree orchards and fields of fragrant lavender. 
</P>
<P>
And it is free to play -- a powerful attraction in France, where greens fees 
average $45. 
</P>
<P>
At almost any American resort (as traveling golfers know only too well), 
hackers and beginners know no shame when venturing onto a golf course, no 
matter how crowded play may become behind them. But here at Opio that couldn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Beginners, or debutants as they're called here, must prove that they can at 
least propel the ball forward before being allowed on the course. 
</P>
<P>
All day long and into the night they swarm over a practice range, cajoled, 
coerced, coddled all the while by a team of roving instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Buckets of practice balls are free, as are clubs and lessons. The more 
serious-minded splinter off for clinics in the short game and in putting. 
</P>
<P>
At what by American time would be the cocktail hour they gather dutifully at 
the clubhouse for lectures in golf rules and etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
When they do graduate to the course (which for some smarties happens as soon as 
the first day), they tee off mats of protective astroturf (can't dig up the new 
grass, you know) and are reminded by the starter to move briskly along. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one of the favorite competitions here involves playing the course in 10 
minutes or less (a feat accomplished by relay teams). 
</P>
<P>
Young debutants are also catered to. Youths at Opio have their own course, 
range, putting green and teacher. Vive la difference! 
</P>
<P>
Besides golf, the club offers indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis, a gym, 
biking, fax machines and an arts and crafts workshop, where making perfume is 
one of the things taught. And for $10 you can carry your concoction home in a 
bottle sporting your own private label. 
</P>
<P>
Eating, however, is probably the favorite attraction. Copious buffets are 
offered three times a day. As a special concession to golfers, who tend to get 
so engrossed in the sport that they forget to eat at regular hours, lunch is 
served at the clubhouse until 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
To stay at the new golfing resort village at Opio costs about $115 a day per 
person, double occupancy (room, sports and meals included), or $150 for a 
single. Otherwise, true to the old club ways, you can be doubled up with a 
roommate. For more information, call toll-free (800) CLUB MED. 
</P>
<P>
Easiest way to get to Opio is via Paris, connecting to Nice and onward 18 miles 
to the club by taxi, bus or rental car. 
</P>
<P>
From spring through early fall one airline offers a weeklong Opio package with 
round-trip fare from Los Angeles or San Francisco and a drive-yourself car 
waiting at Nice. 
</P>
<P>
Opio is a tiny place -- just a church and a town hall. The nearest bona fide 
town, and a cobblestoned charmer, is Valbonne. Both are within easy walking 
distance of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of the club's 110 resorts in 32 countries at present offer golf -- 
most at "outside" courses. Following the example set by Opio, at least 10 new 
clubs featuring golf are planned.

CONSUMER REPORT: DAMAGE WAIVER COST TO BE ADDED TO CAR RENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of a collision damage waiver from Hertz or Avis in Europe will be 
added to the regular rates as of April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hertz is dropping its optional CDW coverage for travelers who rent cars at its 
1990 Affordable Europe weekly rates. Consequently, there will be an average 
price increase of about 8% to offset the loss of revenue from selling the CDW, 
according to Simon Todd, vice president for international sales and marketing 
for Hertz. 
</P>
<P>
"But now travelers know they are covered, and we want to erase from their minds 
any possible doubt," Todd said. "American travelers will have a greater feeling 
of security." 
</P>
<P>
This move followed on the heels of Hertz's drive to eliminate the CDW in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a good deal of confusion in the past year and a half by 
consumers on what their credit card coverage of CDW really covered in Europe 
and elsewhere," Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
"The credit-card companies recently began offering this extra coverage, but 
each company has different policies, and sometimes Hertz is called upon to 
explain the policies of the credit card organizations. Travelers should, of 
course, ask their credit card issuer, not us." 
</P>
<P>
One of the major differences between credit card and regular CDW protection 
comes in distinguishing between primary and secondary coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Primary coverage means that if you have an accident the credit card company 
will take care of it without any reference to any insurance you might have, 
whereas secondary coverage means that the credit card company will only cover 
any liability not covered by your own insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of confusion comes from the fact that CDW can mean different 
things in Europe than in the United States. Not too long ago Hertz revised its 
CDW into LDW, or Loss Damage Waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The latter term broadens the renter's responsibility to cover theft and 
vandalism. But in Europe the term CDW is still used, and it just means 
collision and damage coverage, excluding theft and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
While Hertz is still offering the option of CDW in Europe, the rates vary 
according to the model of car and the country where you rent the car. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hertz-provided samples of daily CDW rates: $6.30 to $15.80 in the United 
Kingdom, $8.55 to $14.45 in France and $12.35 to $20.95 in West Germany. And 
you have to pay the value-added tax on this CDW tab as part of your car rental 
cost in countries that levy such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
You also can't buy CDW separately in Hertz's Affordable Australia, New Zealand 
or Asia/Pacific programs. Coverage in those programs is included in the basic 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1 Avis will eliminate any liability on the part of consumers who rent 
a car for use in Europe through its Super Value program, according to Jerry 
Kelly, director of sales and marketing for Europe for Avis. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole aim is to simplify the rental process and enable renters to know 
exactly what their cost is, and not be concerned with whether or not to buy 
options," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Avis will also include personal liability insurance as part of its 
rental price with this new program. "Previously, renters just had third-party 
liability coverage, such as cases where other people sue you, as part of their 
basic cost." 
</P>
<P>
Now you also get personal liability, which you would have had to pay for in the 
past through PAI, or personal accident insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say you broke your leg in Europe in a car accident and the medical cost 
was $3,000. If you didn't have PAI, it would be up to you or your insurer to 
pay this amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Under our new system you're covered up to a certain amount per country, with 
Avis providing your primary coverage. If the cost went over our coverage, then 
you'd go to whatever type of insurer you had providing secondary coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Avis customers do face a rise in car rental prices to cover these changes, 
Kelly admitted. "The increases will reflect the umbrella of extra values we're 
offering renters, which includes more travel itinerary planning assistance 
before you leave the United States and toll-free numbers in major European 
countries where you can call an English-speaking person for advice on any 
travel-related subject, such as where to find a doctor or dentist, and not just 
car repair places." 
</P>
<P>
Until April 1 Avis will continue to offer a two-tier system, with one rate 
structure including CDW and PAI, as well as the value-added tax. Renters can 
still choose a lower rate in the Super Value program, where they have the 
option of buying CDW or PAI (with no choice regarding the VAT). 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the country in Europe, the inclusive Super Value rate is 10% to 
18% more than the rate permitting the CDW option, Kelly added. 
</P>
<P>
The type of credit card you have, as well as the issuer, may determine what 
type of CDW coverage you have. Find out if you're entitled to primary or 
secondary coverage. More expensive cards, of course, are more likely to provide 
primary coverage, as well as other related perks. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what three major credit-card outfits said about their CDW provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- According to a spokesman for Visa, whether CDW coverage is included, and 
whether or not that coverage is primary or secondary, depends on the type of 
card and the bank the card is issued through. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All American Express cards offer what the company calls "car rental loss 
and damage protection," with primary coverage in Europe, an American Express 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Diners Club International spokeswoman said that it offers primary 
coverage through its CDW provision.

PARIS PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A travel agent suggested a trip to Paris in early December. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Paris is beautiful at Christmastime and there would be no crowds 
as there are in summer, spring and fall. She was absolutely right. And there 
were no lines to wait in at either the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay. The French were 
friendly and helpful. Winter there was wonderful and I'll jump at the chance to 
do such a trip again.

ISRAEL DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year for the first time I went to Israel in March. 
</P>
<P>
I loved it so much that I returned with my family in November. Israel is a 
tourist's dream. Great food, lovely accommodations, history, modern cities and 
sites that leave you breathless. 
</P>
<P>
Some recommendations: Laromme Hotel in Jerusalem, lovely accommodations, indoor 
heated pool and a very helpful staff; La Pasta restaurant, Jerusalem. A tour 
guide is a must; my family and I spent four days with Gozal Ben Shaul who 
speaks excellent English and is well-versed historically. He can design a tour 
to fit interests. His number is (04) 336-779.

SAVORING SAFARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having recently returned from a safari in Kenya, I thought you might want to 
know about the marvelous accommodations, great restaurants and amenities of the 
Safari Park on the outskirts of Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
The rates were reasonable and the extensive park-like grounds were lush, green 
and extremely well kept. 
</P>
<P>
I heartily recommend the Safari Park Hotel, P.O. Box 45038, Nairobi, Kenya, as 
one of the best.

BOYCOTT SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was keenly disappointed to see the headline, "Native Crafts Are Reason for 
South African Visit," (Dec. 24). There is no good reason for a South Africa 
visit in today's political climate, and Times staff writer Norman Dash has 
shown a lack of sensitivity to the struggle against apartheid by giving such 
prominent display to a trip which is being boycotted by all those who oppose 
this racist regime.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: FROM AFRICAN PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month we'll study a couple of new -- and excellent -- videos, one dealing 
with Africa, the other with Costa Rica. And while both deal with wildlife 
conservation, the Costa Rica video involves other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa" (two videos), Eco Ventures, 45 minutes each (1988). These two 
remarkable videos, produced by Megan Epler Wood and narrated by George 
Plimpton, will be of special interest to African safari planners and 
ecology-minded armchair travelers. Each video combines spectacular scenery with 
a detailed study of the animals found in parks along the Tanzania-Kenya border. 
</P>
<P>
The first tape opens with stunning views of the vast, 10,000-square-mile 
Serengeti Plain and a map showing the path of migration that the hundreds of 
thousands of zebra, wildebeest and gazelles make on their annual search for 
grasslands and water. According to the narration, it's an ecological cycle that 
has continued for 10 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The camera follows the trek and shows how the animals surmount the incredible 
hardships of their long journey, including the constant threat of predators -- 
hyenas, wild dogs and lions. 
</P>
<P>
You get contrasting, touching scenes of the family-oriented zebra grooming each 
other and the birth of a soon-doomed wildebeest. 
</P>
<P>
The sound and sight of the thundering herd as it struggles across the swiftly 
flowing Mara River are a video highlight that Plimpton calls "one of the 
greatest wildlife spectacles on earth." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wood captures some poignant and amusing scenes of the six-ton elephants 
splashing and playing as they cool off in the mud holes of Amboseli National 
Park at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Elephant teen-agers are shown 
trunk-wrestling, and at an elephant family gathering, viewers watch seniors 
embracing each other as if greeting old friends. Other animals shown in the 
park include flamingoes, cape buffalo, wart hogs and ostriches. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with a discussion between Plimpton and Russell Train, 
chairman of the World Wildlife Fund/The Conservation Foundation, on the threat 
from poachers to this one-great concentration of elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The second tape opens with film clips of an Osa and Martin Johnson safari of 
the 1920s, then concentrates on following the social structure and daily life 
of a pride of lions. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers follow the female as she stalks her prey, while the male spends his day 
lying around surveying his realm, and the cubs wrestle and explore. The pride 
survives in spite of the fact that, according to Plimpton, the female is a poor 
huntress, missing five out of six tries. There also are brief scenes of some of 
the other cats in the Masai Mara Game Reserve, including leopards and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, producer Wood opens with early film from the movie "King Kong," 
comparing it with the gentle mountain gorillas found in the Virunga Mountains 
of Rwanda, where the late anthropologist Dian Fossey lived and died studying 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The gorillas, which usually live at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet, don't 
survive in captivity. Viewers will see the females flirting with the males, and 
the majestic silverback males protecting their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain gorillas are vegetarians, and scenes show them munching on the 
greenery and lolling in the sun, a favorite activity, while young ones stumble 
and frolic as they leave their mother to explore. 
</P>
<P>
Plimpton and Train conclude this segment with a discussion on preserving the 
mountain gorilla and the part that tourism plays in making the world aware of 
the nened for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes are available from Eco Ventures, 2021 L. Street N.W., Suite 250, 
Washington, D.C. 20036. Call toll-free (800) 862-8900. Price: $29.95, or two 
for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Rica" (Megaview Productions International), 1988, 34 minutes. This is 
one of the few videos on Costa Rica, and it's remarkably good. For those who 
have been there, for those planning a trip or for those just curious, it's a 
worthwhile addition to a travel video collection. 
</P>
<P>
Against a montage of quick scenes showing some of the beauty and appeal of this 
Central American country -- lush green forests, rivers, volcanoes, gambling 
casinos and fishing -- the narrator gives viewers a bit of history as well as 
vital statistics on the high literacy rate, climate, number of bird species 
(850), national parks (26), which airlines fly there and an overview of the 
type of its hotels, facilities and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The major part of the video, however, takes viewers on a series of tours that 
cover the most popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
These include a tour of the capital, San Jose, showing scenes of the shopping 
district, central market place, national museum, national theater and 
restaurants. Side trips from San Jose include a visit to Sarchi and its ox-cart 
factory, where the colorful native souvenirs, as well as other crafts, are made 
and sold, and a visit to the enchanting Orosi Valley on the tumultuous 
Reventazon River for scenes of an exciting river rafting trip. This is followed 
by a tour to Tiquicia, "Tico" country, to a typical adobe farm-ranch restaurant 
to enjoy scenes of native food and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Irazu volcano, topping 11,000 feet and from which you can see both the 
Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, is another tour destination, as is a visit to the 
rim of the awesome, still-active Poas volcano. At Cartago, at the foot of 
Irazu, viewers also see the Basilica de Los Angeles, where the La Negrita (the 
Black Virgin) statue is enshrined and to whom miracles have been attributed. 
</P>
<P>
A video highlight is the ride on the jungle train that connects Limon to San 
Jose, passing through coffee and banana plantations and small villages of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Other tours include a jungle adventure launch ride along the Colorado River and 
canals, with a stop at a lodge in the town of Colorado, and trips to the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest and the Carara Biological Reserve to view some of the 
many examples of the colorful and unusual plants, birds and animals being 
protected in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers also will be rewarded with film and narration on the leatherback 
turtles seen laying their eggs on the beach. A final stop is at Lake Arenal, 
where fishermen are seen big-game fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the production was filmed in cooperation with the Swiss Travel 
Service, a tour company of Costa Rica, there are no blatant commercial plugs 
and no tie-ins with hotels or other tourist facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Megaview Productions, 255 N. El Cielo Road, Suite 155, 
Palm Springs, Calif. 92262, (619) 366-8464. Price: $25.

CZECH COMMUNISTS REGROUP FOR ELECTIONS; 
</P>

PRAGUE: POLITICAL PARTIES MUSHROOM AS CIVIC FORUM WRITES ELECTION LAWS. THE KEY 
WILL BE WHICH ONE WINS PARLIAMENT IN JUNE BALLOTING.

Czechoslovakia since the November revolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the second month of what has been dubbed Czechoslovakia's "velvet 
revolution," the action, though off the streets, is no less contentious. Civic 
Forum has won several important battles. But the Communists have not 
surrendered. In various mutations, they are regrouping to mount an electoral 
challenge that could frustrate the plans of the country's new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Militia, the Communist Party's private security force since 1948, 
has been disarmed and disbanded. But when its armory was cracked open in a 
munitions plant at Vlasim, a small town 25 miles south of Prague, its 98 
registered submachine guns were missing. 
</P>
<P>
Such episodes keep people in Prague on edge, especially after the slaughter in 
Romania. Civic Forum unquestionably controls the high grounds of power, 
including the presidency and the government, which has a non-Communist 
majority. More important, non-Communists control such key ministries as Foreign 
Affairs and the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
During round-table discussions on the composition of the current government, 
the Interior Ministry was the chief bone of contention. Civic Forum insisted 
that it be headed by a non-Communist, a demand unacceptable to the Communists. 
The ministry was eventually put under the joint supervision of Prime Minister 
Marian Calfa (a Communist), Deputy Prime Minister Valtr Komarek (a Communist 
supported by Civic Forum) and Jan Carnogursky (a non-Communist). 
</P>
<P>
But as soon as Vaclav Havel became president, he went one step further by 
appointing Richard Sacher, leader of the non-Communist People's Party and 
minister without portfolio, to do the job. For the first time in Eastern 
Europe's leapfrogging revolutions, the Interior Ministry fell into 
non-Communist hands. 
</P>
<P>
Sacher will be looking for more than 98 missing submachine guns. Three of the 
ministry's security units, totaling about 6,000 troops, have also disappeared. 
During the Prague Spring of 1968, no trace of a similar security force could be 
found. It emerged only after the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia, having 
"wintered" in Poland. Preliminary reports suggest that at least one of the 
missing units has surfaced in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry is run by the Communist general Miroslav Vacek. He is 
seriously committed to depoliticizing the army and is already cleaning up his 
top command. Even before Havel was elected president by Parliament, Premier 
Calfa, exercising his powers as acting president, dismissed four generals from 
the army's top command, no doubt on Vacek's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political parties are mushrooming. About a dozen have announced 
formation in the press, or at least on the walls of Prague's study hall of 
democracy -- the subway stations. The conservative Christian Democrats are the 
first to have won parliamentary representation. But the fragmentation of the 
non-Communist vote could potentially lead to brittle coalition governments. 
This represents an electoral danger for the non-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Another danger is the Communist Party in its several new guises. Its 
politicians are rudderless, but the party's provincial apparatus is virtually 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
The bosses in Vlasim represent the main body of the party, halfheartedly 
struggling with its Stalinist legacy. They still argue that demonstrating 
students were insufficiently beaten on Nov. 17 and encourage each other to hang 
in there for another month, when the tide may turn in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Democratic Communist Forum, a "liberal" faction that might 
spin off as a separate, second Communist Party, possibly linking up with the 
Obroda ("Rebirth") club, a political home for liberal Communists expelled after 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
There may even be a third Communist Party in the form of the Czechoslovak 
Agricultural Party. It is wooing the farm vote, roughly 15% of the electorate. 
Its sponsor is the behemoth agro-industrial complex of Slusovice, South 
Moravia, and its chairman is Frantisek Cuba. The Slusovice company was the 
darling of the ancien regime, managing to grow to a size unheard of in 
Czechoslovak agriculture, with assets of about $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ladislav Adamec, the former Czechoslovak premier and now chairman of the 
Communist Party, views the Agricultural Party as his natural ally: "The fate of 
the Communist Party is not hopeless," he said recently on TV, referring to the 
possibility of a post-election coalition with what, in effect, would be 
"agro-Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Even such a coalition would probably not give the Communists control over 
Parliament, but it could make trouble. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the 
countryside is more conservative than the cities. Rural chapters of Civic Forum 
face tough going. Keeping the pig in the sty is frequently more important than 
challenging the local party boss -- whether clad in red or in green. The role 
of the agro-Communists will become much clearer in the wake of their first 
congress, held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary elections may be held on June 8, and enactment of an electoral 
law is expected before the end of this month. Civic Forum is unlikely to go 
into the elections as a political party, but the sitting Parliament will pass 
any electoral law that Civic Forum drafts. The conservativism of the 
countryside might be addressed by creating only two electoral districts for the 
entire country -- the Czech lands and Slovakia. Civic Forum will probably wind 
up backing a slate of people but each candidate will appear under the name of 
his or her respective party. 
</P>
<P>
Having won the first battle for power-sharing and the second for control of the 
government and the presidency, the non-Communists are unlikely to lose the 
third -- Parliament. Then they will face the toughest battle of all: reviving 
the economy.

STATECRAFT: A WILY FRENCH PRESIDENT, ENJOYING RARE CITIZEN SUPPORT, WORKS AT

<P>
Concerned about the future of Germany, France is torn between trying to 
accelerate the development of West European institutions, the better to link 
the destiny of Germany to its partners, or accepting the inevitability of 
reunification in order to control the process. France is not the only nation 
concerned about the future of Germany but it is perhaps the only European state 
that can influence what happens. The United States is too remote and too 
preoccupied with other issues. Great Britain is increasingly irrelevant to 
Germany. The question is, will France choose to exert its influence? 
</P>
<P>
Ideological and partisan divisions in France have so diminished that President 
Francois Mitterrand can demonstrate leadership aboard with a nation virtually 
united behind him at home -- the consummation of Charles de Gaulle's grandest 
hopes for France. Perhaps the most important issue facing France is the 
structure of a new Europe, now that the question of German unification cannot 
be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
France has often sought a role in German affairs. In 1648, at the Peace of 
Westphalia, France was striving for dominance in Western Europe and was only 
too happy to keep Germany fragmented into hundreds of states without a strong 
central authority. In 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, French leaders shared 
the European consensus of maintaining the status quo of a divided Germany. In 
1870 France fought Prussia in a last-ditch effort to prevent German 
unification. After 1870, France no longer sought dominance but security against 
the threat of a powerful aggressive neighbor. In 1919 at Versailles, France 
tried to cripple Germany through border changes and severe reparations. Policy 
after World War II was far more enlightened; it sought a democratic Germany 
within a European Economic Community. Significantly, EC institutions are housed 
at cities in Belgium, Luxembourg and France that Germany invaded in 1914 and 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman initiated, De Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer 
cemented, the special Franco-German relationship that has been the dominant 
feature of European politics in the postwar era. This relationship has been 
based on German economic strength and French freedom of action in political and 
military affairs, leading to the great prestige France enjoys in the federal 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, France is in a better position than ever to act. The curse of 
French political life since the 1789 revolution has been political instability. 
Instability contributed to France's decline as the preeminent continental power 
in the early 19th Century. In the 1930s, polarization between left and right 
reached such extremes that agreement on the basics -- foreign policy and 
national defense -- could not be reached, leading to the debacle of 1940. The 
Fourth Republic, created in 1946, failed to create consensus and collapsed 12 
years later. Even the Fifth Republic initially divided Frenchmen, although in 
the long run its executive-dominated institutions suited contemporary needs. 
</P>
<P>
In the last years, however, the ideological fervor separating right and left 
have almost disappeared, in part because the opposition finally came to power. 
The Socialists' effort at a "break" with capitalism failed in 1981-83; the 
right's 1986-87 efforts at rolling back most of the Socialist legislation soon 
ground to a halt amid popular opposition. "Cohabitation" between a Socialist 
president and a conservative Parliament in 1986 was decisive, producing an "end 
of ideology." Voters reelected Mitterrand because he appeared less divisive 
than his rival, Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there is broad agreement between all major parties on matters of defense 
and foreign policy. The constitution of the Fifth Republic and the current 
political situation give the president considerable room for initiative. And 
Mitterrand has great interest in European and international affairs, with more 
experience than any other European statesman. Like the fox in Machiavelli's 
"The Prince," he has been able to finesse seemingly impossible political 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of two decades, Mitterrand proved that a Socialist could be 
elected president of the republic, that a moribund Socialist Party could be 
transformed into the major French party, that the Communist Party could be used 
to win an election and then dispatched to the dustbin of history. Mitterrand is 
one of the great political strategists in French history; his understanding of 
many domestic issues, especially economic, is less notable. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand clearly wants to play an active role in the creation of a New 
Europe. But will he have the support of the French people? Not because they are 
divided, as in the past, but because they have other things on their mind. 
</P>
<P>
France today seems remarkably inward-looking. The French have entered the age 
of consumerism, with all that implies about attitudes toward work and patterns 
of expenditure. Traditionally strong French domestic industries are often not 
capable of meeting the demands of the consumer market. Unemployment remains a 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
As more young people pursue higher education in overcrowded universities, entry 
in the job market is postponed until the mid-20s, an age group with 
considerable unemployment. The French are not so dazed by the joys of 
consumerism that they can think of nothing else, but the sluggish economic 
situation means that they are preoccupied with holding on to what they have. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about immigration and crime, often with racist overtones, reflect 
French fears for economic security. Preoccupation with domestic issues is 
compounded by the feeling that France is merely a spectator to what is 
happening in the East, with little capacity to influence events. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mystery about where French interests lie in Europe. No French 
leader can be enthusiastic about the prospect of German reunification, 
certainly not someone like Mitterrand who lived through the occupation. But 
neither can France appear to be the stumbling block to reunification. So much 
the better if East Germany maintains a separate identity. Mitterrand's trip to 
East Berlin was clearly intended to prevent a precipitous collapse of East 
Germany, so that this possibility would not be foreclosed. At minimum, 
Mitterrand wanted to buy time to avoid a rapid and uncontrolled process of 
reunification in which French interests would not be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
After World War II, France was willing to accept rebirth of an independent West 
Germany as part of an economically unified democratic Western Europe. If 
Germany is to be reunified, the French will want to be sure that it is a 
democratic Germany encapsulated in a reunited Europe. What Mitterrand cannot 
accept is an uncontrolled reunited Germany dominating central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand has talked in vague terms of a European confederation. On the 
content level, this has sounded like statesmanlike fudge. On the tactical 
level, however, it makes sense. Mitterrand wanted to tie Helmut Kohl into such 
a plan and thus prevent anyone else (especially the Germans) from seizing the 
initiative. He will then do what he does best, work behind the scenes to create 
a situation in which German reunification poses the minimal threat to French 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Politics is full of unforeseen events but Mitterrand's experience also tells 
him that success comes by working carefully, patiently, behind the scenes with 
a long time frame. He has six years left in his term. Although the French may 
be unusually inward-looking, the public and political class will follow a 
presidential leadership that "rises above" controversial domestic issues. With 
help from other West European nations, plus the United States and the Soviet 
Union, perhaps from Germany as well, Mitterrand's job will be to bind Germany 
to Europe with hoops of steel.

As it has been since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the future of Germany is 
once again at the core of revolutionary change rippling across Europe. And the 
reaction of the Western democracies seems to prove George Bernard Shaw's 
aphorism that "There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's 
desire. The other is to get it." Having deplored the division of Europe for 
nearly half a century, the West cannot decide how to relate the eruption of 
freedom in Eastern Europe to the traditional policies of Atlantic cohesion and 
European integration. Trying to pour new wine into old bottles, Western 
democracies seek to reconcile their proclamations of the past with premonitions 
of the future in formulae so ambiguous they can be interpreted to support 
incompatible objectives. 
</P>
<P>
For years conventional wisdom denied the existence of any problem. The Soviet 
grip on Eastern Europe and especially on the German Democratic Republic seemed 
unshakable. Therefore observers expected that West European integration would 
move much more rapidly than German unification. 
</P>
<P>
Events unforeseen and unsettling now belie these assumptions. Soviet power in 
Eastern Europe has collapsed. The Brezhnev Doctrine, committing Red Army 
support to communist regimes, has been abandoned. These events have exposed a 
gap between the West's declaratory policy and its actions which, if not 
bridged, could wreck what four decades of statesmanship achieved. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Western leaders continue to reaffirm a commitment to German 
self-determination. But they hedge their pronouncements with conditions that 
amount to turning the Atlantic Alliance and European integration into obstacles 
to German unification and, in the long term, barriers to the pro-Western 
orientation of the German state. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for instance, has placed German 
unification at the end of a process of democratization for Eastern Europe that 
includes the Soviet Union and that, by implication, preserves the East German 
state as a separate entity for a period expected to last 10-15 years. At a 
recent press conference, French President Francois Mitterrand declared that 
European integration should precede German unification, giving the German 
Democratic Republic a special position within the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stand has been more complex. President George Bush and Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III have put forward four principles to reconcile German 
national aspirations with historic European fears: 
</P>
<P>
The principle of self-determination will be preserved without prejudice to its 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
German unification is to take place within the framework of NATO and the 
European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Unification will be part of a step-by-step process. 
</P>
<P>
Germany must reiterate support for the principles of the Helsinki Act regarding 
its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Statesmen forget at their peril that arcane language is not reality. The 
gradualism being preached is not tied to any specific program, nor has any 
Western leader defined German self-determination or a procedure for achieving 
it. As a result, the West runs a huge risk of turning into partners with the 
Soviet Union, defending the status quo and in sharing -- in German eyes -- the 
opprobrium for the division of Germany heretofore borne solely by the Soviets. 
For decades the West has suspected Moscow of having a German card up its 
sleeve. It would be ironic if the West now handed that card to the Soviets just 
as democracy surges through Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of making the Kremlin and the East German communists the key to 
German national aspirations results not only from Western pronouncements but 
also from Western actions. Both Mitterrand and Baker recently visited East 
Germany and met with leaders shunned by the West for 40 years, leaders who have 
been all but repudiated by the East German public and who even now are making 
it difficult for democratic parties to organize. And the West jumped at a 
Soviet proposal to hold, for the first time since 1971, a meeting of the 
so-called Kommandatura, the four-power control commission for Berlin. These 
gestures -- treating the East German state as the moral and political 
equivalent of the national states of Eastern Europe -- imply a Western interest 
in the German status quo. Over time this will generate a sense that German 
national aspirations are incompatible with the Western orientation of the 
federal republic. 
</P>
<P>
Article 7 of the treaty that laid the basis for German rearmament pledged the 
three Western powers to cooperate in working toward German unification. In the 
stormy debate that followed, the advocates of German integration into the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization were accused by their opponents of jeopardizing 
the ultimate unity of the German nation. 
</P>
<P>
A similar, if less passionate, debate involved the issue of European 
integration. After an initial period of hesitation, all German democratic 
parties committed themselves to Atlantic as well as European institutions, and 
they have carried out their commitments for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's democratic allies should think twice before risking the Western 
connection of the federal republic by forcing German leaders to choose between 
their allies and their national goals. They must not create a German problem in 
the name of avoiding it. Right now, the West German political campaign obscures 
these dangers because the opposition parties have chosen to blame Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's alleged heavy-handedness for federal republic frustrations. But 
this quarrel will be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how to treat East Germany internationally brooks no delay. In 
Eastern Europe, democratic institutions are likely to enhance domestic 
stability. In the German Democratic Republic, the opposite is certain to occur; 
free elections will generate pressures for unification. No formula can alter 
the fact that the principal reason for the existence of the East German state 
has been as a communist outpost of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
If the East German people desire a separate state, no country in the world 
would object -- probably not even the federal republic. But Western nations 
would be taking a fateful step if their own policies incited such an evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the time scale for unification or its nature, a direction must be 
established within the next year. Once two German states -- especially 
democratic ones -- become fixtures of the European equilibrium, German 
unification can be pursued only at the cost of an international crisis. 
European politics will revert to the patterns of the 18th and 19th centuries. 
Outside powers -- especially the Soviet Union -- will be given an opportunity 
to manipulate inter-German rivalry. For the 200 years before German 
unification, as many wars were sparked by Germany's division as by its 
subsequent unity. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the choices are limited. Any attempt to make progress toward German 
unification conditional on progress toward European integration will defeat 
both -- this is the weakness of the American principles. It will sooner or 
later turn German nationalism against European integration and Atlantic unity. 
And it will probably prove counterproductive to integration by giving those who 
fear German unity -- and are not enthusiastic about European integration -- the 
opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. 
</P>
<P>
Policy cannot invent reality; it can only use it. The time frames for German 
unification and European integration are simply not the same. The former is 
driven by fundamental emotions fueled by established democratic procedures; the 
latter reflects prudent calculations driven by technical bureaucratic 
procedures. The real choice for the Western allies is whether they fear German 
unity more than they prize European integration and Atlantic cohesion. The way 
to avoid German preponderance is not to ascribe to it motives contrary to 40 
years of responsible German policy, even less to divide that country. Should 
Germany, against all current indications, seek the road of hegemony, Britain 
and France always have the option of increasing their cooperation within the 
framework of European and Atlantic institutions. And the United States would 
surely use its influence to prevent an outcome that it opposed in two wars. 
</P>
<P>
Several factors drive German unification. The dissolution of internal frontiers 
will force the federal republic to move rapidly toward equalization of living 
conditions in both parts of Germany. Otherwise, a mass exodus of East Germans 
is probable, exceeding the capacities of the federal republic to sustain. 
Common economic policies are inevitable; a common currency cannot be far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Another impetus will be supplied by the elections scheduled for the two parts 
of Germany later this year: in the East in May, in the West in December. After 
initially declaring a hands-off policy, the West German political parties are 
apparently ready to make a major effort in the East elections because the 
outcome might give the winner a leg up in the West election campaign. It is 
highly improbable that the policies toward unification will, being essentially 
nonpartisan, vary on either side of the dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, appeals for gradualism are curiously irrelevant, and assurances to 
the Soviet Union that no effort will be made to accelerate the process could be 
dangerous. In fact, the victors of World War II have no realistic method to 
implement their misgivings. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union surely has the physical power to prevent German unification. 
But to do so by force would wreck the "Gorbachev fever" in central Europe on 
which Moscow has staked so much and worked so hard to foster. The Kremlin can 
also offer unification in return for Germany loosening its Western ties. 
</P>
<P>
The only realistic way to moderate the pace of events and to keep Germany in 
the Western community is to come to an agreement on the desired outcome and 
then to plan together the precise steps to reach the goals. Like many 
contemporaries who experienced the Hitler regime and World War II, I would have 
suffered no sense of deprivation had the issue of German unification remained 
in limbo for a while longer. Now that it has risen, we no longer have the 
option of deferring it to a more convenient moment. 
</P>
<P>
A faster pace for European integration is highly desirable. But paradoxically 
it is most likely in the context of a Western plan on German unification. This 
is the best way of ensuring that European integration and the Atlantic Alliance 
are not perceived in Germany as a subterfuge for delaying unification. 
Particular steps can be staged over a reasonable time period, so long as the 
process moves toward an acceptable objective. 
</P>
<P>
The confederation proposal by Chancellor Kohl -- greeted so lukewarmly by his 
allies -- represents the minimum compatible with German aspirations and 
international necessities. Overcoming their misgivings, the allies should 
develop a long-range program in four stages: 
</P>
<P>
Elaboration of a timetable for German confederation to be completed within a 
two-year period. The confederation should have a common foreign policy as its 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of another major step toward European political integration 
should be completed in a fixed time period after establishment of the German 
confederation. An important component is a specific program to enable Eastern 
countries to enter into association with the European community. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrent negotiation of a new European security system as a step toward full 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
Development of a program to move from confederation to whatever form of German 
unity a process of self-determination generates. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion of a European security system demands another article. For present 
purposes it is enough to stress that the opportunity to build a truly new 
international system must not be lost in a maze of bureaucratic formulas 
masking old fears. It requires a clear vision of what lies ahead and, above 
all, an initiative equal to the challenge before us.

TEXTBOOKS AND FAIRY TALES: THE VALUE OF CLASSIC MYTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Keeler, Barbara Keeler is a writer of reading and language-arts 
textbooks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents in La Puente recoiled recently at what they found in their children's 
elementary-school reading books: monsters that cut children's heads off, pigs 
that live on body wastes, witches that cast spells. Their objections, spread 
through a national Christian group called Citizens for Excellence in Education, 
has resulted in several school districts dropping the nationally used texts. 
</P>
<P>
In targeting the series called "Impressions" and its publisher, Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich, the complaining parents seem unaware that what offends them arises 
from the nature of many literary classics themselves, and that such elements 
abound in classic literature. The decision to base reading texts on classics -- 
getting away from Dick-and-Jane style readers -- was made by the creators of 
the English-Language Arts Framework of the state of California, not by textbook 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The new texts have been praised by educators for stimulating children's 
imaginations, but Citizens for Excellence in Education and other fundamentalist 
Christian groups have mounted a growing attack on such books as inappropriate 
for young children, claiming the books attack values that parents try to 
inculcate in the home. 
</P>
<P>
California-approved school texts are now required to draw selections from 
literary classics. Such classics have retained their popularity over time and 
are valued by educators for richness of language, appeal to universal feelings 
and needs and a "capacity to move the human spirit in any age," as the state 
guidelines put it. 
</P>
<P>
But a decision to choose classics as sources of reading material is a decision 
to accept elements that would not be acceptable in material written in 1990 for 
today's educational market. Any reading series adopted in California, 
therefore, is likely to contain some such elements. 
</P>
<P>
A story that has been around long enough to become classic has necessarily 
originated at times when different values dominated -- some of which are 
incompatible with those embraced by today's educational system. Therefore 
publishers who would write textbooks for the state of California face 
contradictory mandates. Any original material they write must be free not only 
of gruesome elements, but of sexism, racism and ageism. 
</P>
<P>
Text material must deal sensitively with disabilities and deformities. Yet 
textbooks are required to include classics written in a setting where racism 
and sexual stereotyping are a fact of life; good parents and teachers beat 
children; elderly or deformed characters are often cast as villains; witches 
cast evil spells, to be countered by benevolent spells, and a happy tale ends 
with the cruel and unusual punishment of the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The elements probably most at odds with today's values are to be found in fairy 
tales, traditionally read to young children. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest that parents who are concerned about these stories take a look 
at the Brothers Grimm," said Thomas Williamson, director of the school textbook 
division of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 
</P>
<P>
The Brothers Grimm -- Jakob and Wilhelm, 19th-Century German philologists -- 
created early written versions of the oral tales from which many of today's 
popular fairy tales are derived. 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at the Grimm fairy tales, which children have loved for years -- 
they offer magic and enchantment, triumphs of good over evil, wishes fulfilled 
under impossible odds. They are tales in which the small, young or weak can 
vanquish a monstrous or powerful villain, giving children hope. Long before 
they can evaluate more complex issues, children can appreciate the stark 
contrast of absolutes: good versus evil, greed versus generosity, industry 
versus laziness, beauty versus ugliness, cleverness versus stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Grimm's and other fairy tales embody many elements that 
would seem grotesque or perverted even in today's adult literature. Characters 
are threatened or devoured by cannibals or human-eating animals and monsters. 
In the "Robber Bridegroom," for example, a betrothed maiden discovers that her 
intended plans to cook and eat her. Hansel is fattened up by the witch and 
checked daily for weight gain. In early versions of "Little Red Riding Hood," 
the heroine is eaten alive as a fitting punishment for her disobedience. In the 
later Grimm version, she is unappetizingly rescued through an incision in the 
wolf's belly, which is subsequently filled with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
The wolf's punishment is mild compared with that inflicted on many fairy-tale 
villains. Children demand justice in a story, but justice hardly requires the 
brutal, inhuman penalties imposed on villains in Grimm's fairy tales. In "The 
Goose Girl," for example, a treacherous maid is "put stark naked into a barrel 
stuck with nails, and dragged along by two white horses . . . until dead." In 
Grimm's version of "Snow White," the stepmother is forced to dance in red-hot 
iron shoes until she dies. In the Grimm version of Cinderella, the stepsisters' 
eyes are pecked out by doves -- this after they have mutilated their feet in 
attempts to fit the glass slipper. In "The Pink," a villain is forced to eat 
live coals and is then torn into quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales also contain material that seems sick by 
today's standards. In "The Wild Swans," for example, witches dance naked in the 
cemetery, dig up dead bodies and eat them. In "The Rose Elf," a young girl 
visits her decapitated lover's grave, digs up his body, retrieves his head, 
kisses it, takes it home with her and buries it in a flowerpot. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Stone, El Segundo children's librarian and instructor of literature for 
adolescents and children at Loyola Marymount University, points out that 
ancient tales were not originally created for children. "The concept of 
childhood as we see it is a recent invention -- children were once viewed as 
small adults. They were dressed as adults, educated as adults and worked with 
adults. Issues in these tales were addressed to adults and children alike." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, cautionary tales required penalties more significant than being 
grounded or standing in the corner. Many traditional tales were written to 
influence the behavior of the audience, and storytellers who would discourage 
given behavior were challenged to devise deterrents more severe than the 
hardships and brutal conditions of the historical period. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the behavior rewarded in fairy tales is always exemplary. For example, 
the "villain" who tears himself in two at the end of "Rumpelstiltskin" is the 
only character who has told the truth, kept his word and showed compassion. The 
miller who lies about his daughter, a wife who deceives her husband and a 
husband who threatens to kill his wife live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
Disney versions of fairy tales omit the most gruesome elements. Snow White's 
stepmother does not eat the heart she believes to be Snow White's. Commercial 
producers are free to adapt these tales at will. The Disney versions of "The 
Little Mermaid" and "Peter Pan," for example, depart radically from the story 
lines of the original classics. Textbook publishers, however, can be penalized 
for taking such liberties. In many districts, adoption committees rate programs 
by a system that penalizes them for any editing, abridgement or adaptation of a 
classic, regardless of the reason. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers can choose from many classic versions of fairy tales, and they 
choose versions containing the least violence and morbidity. However, they 
cannot get around the fact that these tales themselves came from times and 
cultures whose values clashed with our own. Many elements considered 
objectionable today are inherent in such tales. Can publishers be blamed for 
that? 
</P>
<P>
Apart from violence, the sexism that pervades fairy tales could never be 
smuggled past adoption committees if it were written today. In many fairy 
tales, the heroine is valued primarily as a sexual prize. She need only be 
young and beautiful to attract countless suitors, often despite appalling 
behavior and character traits. For example, in Andersen's "The Traveling 
Companions," Hans tours the garden of the princess and finds it decorated by 
the bones and skulls of the imprudent suitors who have courted her. She had 
agreed to marry any man who could guess her thoughts, but the penalty for error 
was a cruel death. Nevertheless, Hans falls in love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
Fairy tales and other classics are well-crafted works of literature with 
enduring appeal. As such, they are worth teaching. It behooves parents and 
teachers, however, to discuss classics in light of the way values have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Parents also need to understand that in order to influence textbook content, 
they must make their concerns known years before textbooks are purchased. To 
give one example: The question of evolution versus creation, which came to the 
fore in California last year during debate over science textbooks, pertains to 
a science "framework" for schools that will be implemented in 1994.

<P>
"Communism, Corruption and Korea!" 
</P>
<P>
That was the attack theme of the 1952 campaign, which swept Harry S. Truman's 
party out of the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The "mess in Washington" that Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon 
assailed was the scandal that erupted over influence-peddling by the Truman 
"cronies" known as the "five-percenters." For a 5% fee, they had been steering 
clients to the right people on the Hill, in the Cabinet and at the White House 
to get that federal contract. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after the scandal, influence-peddling has become a richly rewarded 
and honored way of life in Washington. In a 1983 Harper's piece, "There's No 
Shame Anymore," Robert Kaus wrote of "a new air of freedom and independence." 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives who came to Washington to battle Big Government lobby for 
subsidies to Big Business. Liberals who came to regulate corporate power lobby 
to exempt Fortune 500 companies from rules they wrote themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They came to Washington to do good, and stayed on to do well. 
</P>
<P>
Now the downward spiral deepens. Law and public-relations firms are boldly 
taking on as clients Communist governments like Angola, and Communist parties, 
like Hungary's. Japan, Inc., in its battle for economic supremacy with the 
United States, has recruited, at great cost, a fifth column of mercenaries -- 
ex-Cabinet officers, former White House aides and U.S. senators -- and sent it 
into the halls of the federal government to do battle for the Empire of the 
Rising Sun. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Judis in the New Republic, in the last two years, through its 
agencies, foundations and multinationals, Japan pumped $400 million into U.S. 
universities, think tanks, law firms and PR firms to buy a better image and 
influence the government decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have hired more than 110 former government officials," Judis 
writes. "Almost every important ex-trade official works for the Japanese in 
some capacity. These include three former U.S. trade representatives: (William) 
Eberle, William E. Brock III, who advises Toyota, and Robert S. Strauss . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the top Democrat and Republican Party officials work for the Japanese. 
Last December, when the Democratic Party was going to choose a chairman, three 
of its four leading candidates -- Ronald H. Brown and former Reps. James R. 
Jones and Michael D. Barnes -- all represented Japanese firms. Former 
Democratic chair Charles T. Manatt represents Japanese firms, and when Hogan 
&amp; Hartson's (law firm) Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. was Republican chair, he 
helped one of his law firm's clients gain entree to Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
When Toshiba had sold Moscow the secret technology that enabled our submarines 
to run silent -- thereby putting at risk the American kids who volunteer for 
this dangerous Navy duty -- an enraged Senate voted 92-5 to bar Toshiba sales 
for three years. The Tokyo executives quickly funneled $10 million to their 
American lobbyists, who persuaded Congress to settle for a slap on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Do American companies hire ex-Japanese cabinet officers and Diet members to 
lobby for U.S. interests in Tokyo? 
</P>
<P>
No way. "In Japan," writes Judis, "no self-respecting lawyer, let alone former 
government official, is willing to lobby for an American company. 'They would 
be seen as paid men,' one Japanese official said. But what is culturally and 
morally forbidden in Japan is accepted procedure in contemporary Washington. 
'In Washington,' Chalmers Johnson says, 'the fix is always in.' " 
</P>
<P>
In America today, a great debate is under way between free traders and those 
who hold that trade policy should be an arm of U.S. foreign policy. Is it not a 
massive corruption of that debate if some of the participants, who loudly 
invoke Adam Smith and Milton Friedman, are themselves the hired men of 
protectionist Japan? 
</P>
<P>
In Washington today, paid lobbyists and registered agents of foreign powers 
grow annually in number and influence. As they do, what was once grandly called 
the "national interest" of the United States is forgotten, and U.S. foreign 
policy and trade policy reflect more and more only the brokered compromises 
among the armies of mercenaries. 
</P>
<P>
When the Old American Republic disappeared into the global American empire, 
tell me again, what did we get, for all we lost?

Ron Kovic, the paralyzed war hero of "Born on the Fourth of July," is readying 
for a new firefight. This time, the terrain will not be the jungles of Vietnam 
but the John Wayne politics of Orange County. This time, his rival will not be 
the Viet Cong but Robert "B-1 Bob" Dornan, the most hawkish member of the U.S. 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
While the 44-year-old combat veteran has yet to formally declare a challenge to 
the reelection of the archconservative Dornan, shrapnel has begun to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, an out-and-out critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam, says he is "deeply 
concerned" by the President's decision to invade Panama. "Are we going into 
Nicaragua next? Into El Salvador?" He attacks what he calls the "wall of fear" 
put up by the Administration and Dornan toward other countries in this 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes more courage to make friends than it does to pull a trigger," he 
says. "As a congressman, I would build bridges of friendship with our neighbors 
instead of this policy of fear and hostility." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic hopes that his campaign for Congress will "remind people about what 
really happened in Vietnam so it won't happen again." Admitting that he is not 
a "professional" in the political world, he hopes his challenge to Dornan will 
be a "campaign of statesmanship," conducted on a "high plane of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. If Kovic wanted a high-toned debate over America's proper role in 
the world, he picked the wrong opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dornan, the man whose congressional seat Kovic has targeted, despises such 
second-guessing of American policy. He has particular disdain for those like 
Kovic and filmmaker Oliver Stone who portray Americans as "scum" in the world's 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Kovic) hadn't been shot," says the man with a 100% conservative, 
pro-military voting record, "he'd have been strutting about his two tours in 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
It gets worse. The 56-year-old Dornan says that the only reason Kovic is 
talking about challenging him is to sell more tickets to "Born on the Fourth of 
July," the film Kovic co-authored and which is now the country's No. 1 
box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to milk this thing for two months. This guy has no idea whatever of 
spending the next two years going back and forth to Washington, getting on and 
off airplanes. He's just out to hype the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan mocks the Democrats' decision to recruit Kovic for the race against him. 
"They saw a wheelchair and said this guy's perfect for Dornan." 
</P>
<P>
He says the Democrats deserve an " 'F' for candidate research." He accuses them 
of finding the wrong man to run in the wrong district. 
</P>
<P>
On this, the peripatetic ex-Los Angeles talk-show host may have a point. Orange 
County is one of the most conservative areas in the country. Many of its 
middle-class voters honor the myth of an unbeatable, untarnished America, a 
nation that can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What will Ron Kovic say to such people? How will a man who knows the crippling 
defeat and moral destructiveness of America's worst war campaign among her most 
ardent patriots? 
</P>
<P>
"I will talk about the building of a new American house," Kovic says without 
hesitation, "with a foundation that is based on truth, what we have gone 
through as a country and where we are going. I believe people have the strength 
of character to face up to this, to turn our wounds into wisdom. They are ready 
to be challenged again, just as they were by John F. Kennedy on that cold 
January day back in 1960." 
</P>
<P>
Does someone who speaks in such grand phrases know the hell he faces at the 
hands of Bob Dornan? 
</P>
<P>
"If I run, it will be an incredible battle, the most difficult challenge of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
For a Marine sergeant who endured the horror of Vietnam and the inhumanity of a 
V.A. hospital and who has spent almost three decades in a wheelchair, this may 
indeed be an overstatement. Anyone who has been through what Kovic has can 
survive whatever brickbats "B-1 Bob" may throw at him.

NEW CONSENSUS SURVIVES A TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David S. Broder, From David S. Broder's syndicated column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The static on the left should not obscure the fact that Panama represents the 
best evidence yet that, 15 years after the Vietnam War ended, Americans really 
have come together in recognition of the circumstances in which military 
intervention makes sense. The elements of agreement have been in place for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's contribution is to demonstrate that the new national consensus 
will survive when tested. 
</P>
<P>
The people whom I've been interviewing are also clear that the circumstances 
that justified intervention in Panama are not going to be present in many other 
places. They are writing no blank checks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we have, in fact, achieved a good deal of clarity in the nation on this 
question, which divided us so badly during and after the Vietnam War. That's an 
important achievement, and one which should not be obscured by a few dissident 
voices on the left.

GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your gun control editorial "A Move Toward Sanity" (Dec. 31) seems to gloss over 
some important facts. You refer to Patrick Purdy as a disturbed petty criminal. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that Purdy had been charged with felony crimes seven times, 
including drugs, assaults and weapons charges, and each time the charges were 
either dropped or reduced to a misdemeanor. Because of this, he was legally 
allowed to purchase numerous firearms, even to include some 15-day background 
checks. One felony conviction would have prevented these purchases. Obviously 
we have a severe breakdown in our justice system. Why have you never called for 
harsher punishment of crimes and a reduction of the commonly used 
plea-bargaining process that allowed Purdy to evade our laws? 
</P>
<P>
As a second comment, you seem to suggest that a 15-day waiting period will 
somehow keep guns out of the hands of criminals. It is a well-documented fact 
that criminals don't buy guns on the commercial market; they steal them or have 
access to an underground gun trade. And furthermore, the law enforcement 
community and Justice Department admit that they can't even conduct background 
checks within 15 days for handgun sales, and now we are going to more than 
double their workload! 
</P>
<P>
Laws such as AB 497, although well-intentioned, will only result in 
restrictions to our law-abiding citizens. As a final comment, please tell your 
readers how many assault rifles have been turned in or registered by the Crips 
and Bloods gangs. It is my guess that on that score card, the only one which 
really counts, we are batting zero.

INNOCENT VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 3, I was arrested for civil disobedience at the Los Angeles Federal 
Building. I had never been arrested before. 
</P>
<P>
I was afraid to put myself in that position, but more afraid not to. 
</P>
<P>
Arrest was my way of solidarity with the people of El Salvador whose lives, 
dreams, hopes and desires are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
I was also there for the equally innocent victims here in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I am tired of washing blood from my shoes after praying in emergency rooms 
beside young bodies first shot up with guns then cut up like a side of beef by 
doctors trying in vain to save their lives. I am tired of burying 18 and 19 
year olds, cousins and brothers, nieces and nephews of the same family. I am 
tired of the fear that grips the elderly who are afraid to come out at night 
because of the gang and drug violence that claims the lives of our youth. 
</P>
<P>
I am tired of burying infants because mothers could not afford decent prenatal 
care right here in Southern California. I am tired of seeing teens drop out of 
school because they cannot keep up or because their families need them to work 
or because they have no hope of a decent income unless they sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
For these victims, the unknown of America and El Salvador, I risked arrest and 
for them I will do so again.

GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Your claim that the National Rifle Assn. does not truly represent the interests 
of its members is entirely spurious. 
</P>
<P>
I am a life member, and I have yet to meet another member -- or even non-member 
shooter -- who agrees with the gun control measures promoted recently in 
Sacramento and endorsed by you. 
</P>
<P>
I also find it interesting that you take the NRA to task for devoting itself to 
the one issue (gun ownership) it exists to address, yet you don't find anything 
wrong with Pete Shields and Handgun Control Inc. doing the same thing on the 
other side of the issue. Your double standard is showing.

GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's warning to street gangs and drug traffickers that 
he intends to enforce "to the hilt" the new Assault Weapons Control Act is an 
empty threat (Part A, Jan. 4). 
</P>
<P>
If he can't enforce the laws against murder, assault and drug dealing which 
these criminals are breaking openly in the streets, then how does he plan to 
enforce a law against unregistered firearms hidden in closets and car trunks? 
</P>
<P>
The threat is very real for the 300,000 honest citizens who legally own the 
banned firearms for legitimate, traditional and constitutionally protected 
reasons. Those who choose not to register because they feel that the law is 
unjust face criminal arrest, but only after violation of their right against 
search and seizure. In no other way is enforcement possible. Those who comply 
with the law will have their name, address and description of firearm given to 
local police for some unstated reason. 
</P>
<P>
What, exactly, does "to the hilt" mean?

A JUMP OFF A BRIDGE WON'T KILL THIS MONSTER; 
</P>
<P>
RACISM: IT IS NOW SO POWERFUL IN OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY THAT IT 
THREATENS THE SOUL OF OUR NATION AND OUR STATUS AS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police now believe that a cold-blooded murderer in Boston plotted to kill his 
pregnant wife, then produced an instant alibi by blaming his crime on an 
African American man. Charles Stuart knew that pulling the race cord would ring 
the bells of fear in a nation still tasting the lingering poison of a 
presidential campaign that played on racial anxiety. The police looked into 
Stuart's role in his wife's death only when his brother told them what he knew. 
Then Charles Stuart, who understood how racism worked in America, jumped off a 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
This monstrous episode has much to teach us about the dynamics of racism in our 
country. The brutal ideology that was set back by the Civil War, Reconstruction 
and the civil rights movement has returned with tremendous force during the 
past decade. Racism is now so powerful again in our domestic and foreign policy 
that it threatens the soul of our nation and our status as leader of the Free 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Ronald Reagan sent the first deafening race-signal in 1980 with his 
transparent appeal to states rights in Philadelphia, Miss., where Michael 
Schwerner, James Cheney and Andrew Goodman, two Jews and one African American, 
were killed by white supremacists in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
And so the racial agenda for the Reagan-Bush years was set: the diluting of the 
Civil Rights Commission; the laying of a wreath in a German cemetery where some 
Nazi soldiers were buried; the attack on affirmative action; President Reagan's 
suggestion in 1983 that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a communist; the 
retrenchment on civil rights and social justice; the Bush campaign committee 
that included members known for past anti-Semitic activities; and the shameful 
presidential campaign in 1988 that featured furloughed prisoner Willie Horton. 
As many have noted, Reagan took the shame and guilt out of racism. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, too, racism made a comeback. The "constructive engagement" 
with the apartheid government in South Africa became the symbol of the 
Reagan-Bush approach to the human rights of nonwhite people. The arming of 
rampaging guerrillas in Angola and Nicaragua showed a shocking indifference to 
life in the Third World, as did the military invasions of Grenada and Panama. 
Would we be so quick to invade these nations and so cavalier about the death of 
their people if those dying were, say, Europeans? 
</P>
<P>
Even the good news of walls tumbling down in Eastern Europe contains a dark 
lining for the people of Africa. For, as the Congress hurried to approve 
millions more for Eastern Europe, African experts noted the total U.S. aid to 
the countries of sub-Saharan Africa was likely to fall as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, it was shocking to watch the misplaced priorities over the last 
few weeks as letter-bombs exploded in the hands of judges and NAACP leaders 
across the South while President Bush placed a bounty on the head of Manuel A. 
Noriega. Where are the bounties on the heads of the white supremacists 
terrorizing citizens and public officials in America? 
</P>
<P>
The racism that still contaminates public policy must be overcome. The war on 
drugs, for example, will go nowhere as long as we accept the myth that the 
average drug user is an African American male. The reality, according to the 
National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, is that the average 
drug user is a white male, and drug problems are "significantly worse" among 
white youth than African American youth. The least likely drug user is an 
African American female. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the police arrest African Americans at a rate far higher than they 
arrest whites. While African Americans constitute only 12 percent of those who 
abuse drugs, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, they make up 38 
percent of drug arrests. This means that African Americans constitute a small 
minority of drug users but a vastly disproportionate percentage of prisoners 
taken in the war on drugs. That is not right. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African American middle class is shrinking, hanging on the 
precipice. While college-educated white men earn an average $35,701 a year, 
African American male college graduates earn an average of $26,550. As Money 
magazine concluded in a study of the eroding African American middle class, "As 
long as today's pattern of discrimination continues, blacks will never become 
fully integrated into the American economic mainstream -- and both races will 
continue to pay the high price for living in different worlds." 
</P>
<P>
So we have much work ahead of us to take down our own wall -- the wall of 
racism and hatred. As the cynical Charles Stuart showed us before his leap from 
the bridge, it is far too easy in America to blame African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
As we celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we must remember 
that the wall of racism keeps all Americans apart, incomplete and down. Racism 
is good neither for the racist nor the victim. It is personally destructive, 
politically divisive, economically exploitative, and theologically a sin. 
Racism is contempt for God because it assumes that God made an error in 
creating a world of difference. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. Martin Luther King said, "All life is interrelated. All humanity is 
involved in but a single process, and to the degree I harm my brother, to that 
extent I harm myself."

<P>
ARGENTINA: IN A CHARADE OF RECONCILIATION, VICTIMS OF THE 'DIRTY WAR' ARE 
'PARDONED' ALONG WITH THEIR MURDERERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Juan Gelman, Translated by Louise B. Popkin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-November, a number of prominent U.S. writers and intellectuals urged 
President Saul Menem of Argentina not to pardon the military officers who are 
still in prison serving sentences for violations of human rights committed 
under the 1976-83 military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of Argentines who are victims of those years' "dirty war" 
is the poet Juan Gelman, who is now living in Mexico. After he wrote the 
following commentary, his son's remains were identified. Gelman returned to 
Buenos Aires for the burial last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 7, President Saul Menem issued pardons for 216 military personnel and 
civilians who had been found guilty of crimes ranging from genocide to 
attempted coups to responsibility for the disaster of Malvinas (the war with 
Britain over the islands known in English as the Falklands). Menem also 
pardoned 64 other persons with presumed links to "subversion." That pushed to 
its limits the "two devils theory," formulated by the writer Ernesto Sabato 
while he was chairman of the commission appointed by then-President Raul 
Alfonsin to investigate human-rights violations committed under the 
dictatorship. In Sabato's theory, the "dirty war" was a struggle between 
ultra-right extremists and leftist subversives in a totally polarized Argentine 
society. 
</P>
<P>
I was horrified to find on the list of supposedly leftist subversives the names 
of four members of the Uruguayan armed forces. They had long been identified as 
torturers who worked with the Argentine authorities in the death camp known as 
Automotores Orletti because of its location in an old auto-repair shop in 
Buenos Aires. It was in that camp that my son Marcelo "disappeared" in 1976, 
along with his wife, Claudia. Both were 20 years old at the time and awaiting 
the birth of their first child -- my grandchild, who today is heaven knows 
where. 
</P>
<P>
I was just as horrified to see on that list the names of "disappeared" persons, 
such as Maria Alicia Morsillo and Graciela Alberti, and of Norberto Gomez, 
whose death is a matter of public record, complete with official death 
certificate, and for whose murder -- among others -- former Gen. Jorge Videla 
was found guilty in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was I less horrified to find my own name on that list. 
</P>
<P>
It strikes me that the listing of dead and "disappeared" among the pardoned 
"'subversives" -- for the obvious purpose of padding the list -- has a symbolic 
value: With the exception of the Uruguayan torturers, the living among us are 
thus cast as representatives of 30,000 "disappeared" who bear no responsibility 
for the genocidal acts of the dictatorship or for its surrender of national 
sovereignty. In fact, what we are "pardoned" for is our struggle against that 
surrender, on behalf of social justice and national liberation. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the real difference between the two lists: not in the number of 
pardons issued (which favors the military) but in the nature of the pardon 
itself. In essence, I have been exchanged for the abductors of my children and 
of the thousands of other young people who are now my children as well. 
</P>
<P>
Such an exchange is unacceptable to me. Just as unacceptable is the 
"reconciliation" with murderers and torturers proposed by former guerrilla 
leader Mario Firmenich. Both are perverse indications that an already sick 
society has grown sicker. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Menem has explained that the pardons already granted -- and others still to 
come -- are necessary in the interest of national reconciliation. In reality, 
they are necessary to appease the armed forces. Dr. Menem's explanation is part 
of a rationale in which logic becomes a means of evading moral obligations. Any 
rationale that is devoid of ethical considerations is the antithesis of 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
The decrees issued by Dr. Menem (himself a lawyer) granting pardons to 
murderers and torturers place in jeopardy not just moral obligations but the 
rule of law itself. And when laws can do no right, perhaps it is fitting that 
they bar no wrong. At least, that is what Shakespeare thought.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time has come now, I think, for the city of Sacramento, and perhaps its 
highest-profile developer, to quit following Al Davis around the pasture like 
some bawling calf chasing the wrong mother. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Al Davis is a wrong mother. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that he doesn't have a working teat. Al Davis has a great, 
full teat with a rich and storied history, but it isn't the only teat in this 
pasture, and the spectacle of an entire city hanging breathless each time the 
Davis tail slaps a fly off its behind, of analyzing each twitch, each roll of 
those slow brown eyes as to how it affects the city's chances of latching onto 
that teat, is at this point a humiliation that is hard to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Lukenbill, the developer who heads the group that wants to bring the 
Raiders to Sacramento, says that bringing a football team to Sacramento is 
important. And there is some truth in that. It's fun to have an NFL franchise, 
and fun is at least as important to a city as, say, a transportation system 
that works, because if it weren't, nobody would live in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond fun, however, there is no promised land. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill's vision of Sacramento coming to greatness -- I was going to mention 
"world class" again, but I'm too tired of hearing that to make fun of it 
anymore -- through its sports franchises is simply a reflection of Lukenbill. 
It all sounds good and is empty of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
What was it Davis called him -- the kid off the turnip wagon? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, there's no need to spend a lot of time here recounting the changes this 
vision of greatness-through-sports has gone through in Sacramento in the last 
half a year. The economic promise that helped push Sacramento into a 
$50-million bond sale was simply wrong, and the idea that a major league 
franchise would in some way validate this place or elevate it to a new status 
is also wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What getting the Raiders would do, simply, is give us a professional football 
team. And as much as I'd like to see that, it's time to ask how far we're 
willing to go to get it. 
</P>
<P>
At least to get this professional team. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lukenbill, as I remember, who came out publicly before the bond sale, 
saying it had to be done in a hurry because Davis needed to see that the city 
was sincere. 
</P>
<P>
Or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Lukenbill who said it had to be done in a hurry so that he and his 
partners could see that the city was in earnest. "Performance is an issue. Can 
the public sector perform?" was the way he put it. 
</P>
<P>
So the city issued the bonds, and presumably showed it was sincere and earnest 
and could perform. 
</P>
<P>
And Davis' entire reaction to this show of sincerity and earnestness was 
rolling his slow brown eyes back over the pasture again, just as he'd been 
rolling his eyes over the pasture ever since he put the old milk bag up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
And as the estimates of when such a deal might actually materialize came and 
went -- the last one from Davis' office was "sometime in the next several 
weeks" -- an old, familiar feeling began to permeate the deal, that feeling you 
might have gotten the first time a girlfriend told you she loved you to death 
but didn't want to tie herself to one relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe the second time, when you knew what that meant. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, first Davis was going to decide in weeks, then in months, then 
after the regular season, now after the Super Bowl. And all the time, he keeps 
taking offers. The last one Sacramento made was $50 million for the bus ride 
up, a $120-million stadium and more than $100 million in ticket guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Los Angeles offered him $76 million -- most of it tax-free -- to 
stay where he is. They also offered to tear down the Coliseum, which is as 
close to historic as anything you're going to find in L.A., and build a new 
$140-million stadium, probably with gold bidets in the super boxes. 
</P>
<P>
And Davis rolled his brown eyes and looked back over the pasture to see what 
Oakland and Sacramento would do. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at Los Angeles' new offer, it occurs to me that now would be a good 
time for the city of Sacramento to take a new tack. To negotiate back. To say 
to Al Davis, "You've got a week, and Sacramento withdraws its offer." 
</P>
<P>
The advantage to this is that this city is no longer following Davis all over 
the pasture, bawling. 
</P>
<P>
Davis knows he's got something we want, everybody knows that. 
</P>
<P>
It's time now to find out if we've got something he wants, too. 
</P>
<P>
Not just because Davis is better at negotiating than we are -- and he is better 
-- but because it's the only way we get to come out on the other end of this 
thing with our dignity. 
</P>
<P>
And without that, football isn't any fun anyway.

IN LIBERATED EUROPE, LIBERATION MAY BE THE BANE; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRACY: DYING FOR IT IS MORE ENNOBLING THAN LIVING IT. AND THAT IS WHAT THE 
EAST BLOC IS STARTING TO FIND OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the euphoria, it is easy to forget that liberation is often the beginning of 
human folly, not the end. Because folly requires freedom, liberty is an 
invitation to folly. (The book of Exodus is a useful text on the subject.) In 
the liberated zones of Eastern Europe, the invitation is being accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians have been free for about a month. What is the first great cause they 
have taken up with their new-found freedoms of assembly, petition and speech? 
Chanting "Bulgaria for Bulgarians," they demand the repression of the Muslim 
minority. The country is racked with civil disorder protesting the repeal by 
the new Communist regime of oppressive anti-Turkish decrees. 
</P>
<P>
At the first whiff of glasnost, Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Georgians and 
Ossetians, Uzbeks and Meskhetians marked the lifting of the yoke of the Soviet 
imperium by taking to the streets to beat each other bloody. The newest riots 
in southern Azerbaijan, however, have progressed beyond mere ethnic quarreling. 
The local citizenry, Shiite Muslims, are near insurrection, attacking 
authorities and tearing down border posts. Their demand? Reunification with 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
To my recollection, the British historian Paul Johnson was the first (in 
August, 1988) to warn of the coming Balkanization of East Europe and the 
rekindling of ancient ethnic strife as the Soviet Empire broke up. By now, 
everyone is familiar with the fact (though few anticipated the fury) of 
intolerant nationalism as the great bane and the potential ruin of the newly 
liberated Soviet zone. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of potential ruin is now equally obvious: the economic costs of 
de-communization. A report from Poland spoke of people losing patience with 
Solidarity's program of radical economic reform. Polish capitalism was all of 
six days old at the time. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other bane facing liberated Europe, less obvious than ethnic and 
economic disillusionment, but just as preordained. It is the coming political 
disillusionment. Democracy in the abstract is a glory second to none. But 
liberated Europe is about to experience the first half of Churchill's famous 
quip that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others. 
</P>
<P>
Not just that it is messy and corrupt. A friend of mine, an adviser to one of 
Hungary's new democratic parties, brought a group of aspiring Hungarian 
politicians over to the United States last fall to imbibe democracy at the 
wellspring. They were treated to a tour of the New York mayoralty and the 
Virginia gubernatorial campaigns. During their 40 years of jail and repression, 
of samizdat and secret police, did they dream, could they have imagined, that 
at the end of the tunnel lay Jackie Mason? 
</P>
<P>
It is not just that Hungary and the rest are headed for party squabbling and 
back-room deals, media events and campaign lies. The disillusionment with 
democracy will involve something far deeper. 
</P>
<P>
First, the realization that real democracy actually establishes limits to 
popular will. Under constitutionalism, not everything is permitted even if the 
people will it. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the liberation's more remarkable twists, Bulgaria's government last 
week rejected calls in the street for a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators demanded a referendum on ethnic rights in order to deny them 
to the 15% Turkish minority. A statement pointing out that fundamental human 
rights cannot be subject to popular vote was issued jointly by the democratic 
opposition and -- how rich our history -- the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The second and more deeply disillusioning truth about democracy is that it is 
designed at its core to be spiritually empty. As Isaiah Berlin wrote 30 years 
ago in his great essay "John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life," the defining 
proposition of liberal democracy is that it mandates means (elections, 
parliaments, markets) but not ends. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy leaves the goals of life entirely up to the individual. Where the 
totalitarian state decrees life's purposes -- Deng's Four Modernizations, 
Castro's Rectification Campaigns, and the generic exhortation about "building 
socialism" -- democracy leaves a naked public square. 
</P>
<P>
What a shock for those whose lives have been so infused with purpose by the 
struggle against totalitarianism. That is why the original East German 
oppositionists looked with dismay at the post-Wall revelers, those content to 
see the revolution "drowned in West Berlin chocolate." That is why the victory, 
the miracle, of 1989 will be as disillusioning as it is now exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit of victory is bourgeois democracy -- the most free, most humane, most 
decent political system ever invented by man, and the most banal. Dying for it 
is far more ennobling than living it. Liberated Europe is just getting to the 
living part.

Communist North Korea proposed talks with South Korea on allowing free travel 
between the rival countries, but South Korea rejected the idea. The proposal 
was made in letters delivered in the border village of Panmunjom and addressed 
to South Korea's president, prime minister and three main opposition leaders. 
According to South Korean officials, North Korea repeated a proposal that the 
two Koreas hold "top-level political talks" to discuss free travel on the 
Korean peninsula.

Fire broke out in a basement discotheque in Zaragoza early today, and 43 people 
died of smoke inhalation, a government official in the northern Spanish city 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Governor Carlos Terez Anadon said about 130 people were inside the Flying 
disco when the fire broke out at about 3:45 a.m. Three others were hospitalized 
with serious smoke inhalation. The victims, most in their mid-40s, were unable 
to find their way out of the disco after the lights went out, firemen said. The 
cause of the blaze was not known but an electrical fault was suspected.

General Electric Co. will detail next week in Cincinnati plans to develop what 
is billed as the world's biggest and most powerful civilian jet engine, 
designed to power the new generation of jumbo jets in the next century, a 
company spokesman said. The engine will permit the proposed Boeing 777 super 
jumbo jet and other planes to handle increased weight with only two engines 
rather than the three or four on today's jets, saving fuel costs and providing 
greater operating efficiency, the spokesman said. Sources said the impetus for 
the new engine was the recent announcement by Boeing Co. that it would go ahead 
with plans to build its 777.

The crash occurred late Friday about 10 miles west of the ski resort town, the

A global electricity crisis with blackouts and curtailed usage will plague the 
1990s unless drastic steps are taken to build more power plants, a panel of 
energy experts warned Saturday. The impending power shortage threatens jobs, 
public health and economic development, a panel of 31 energy experts from 13 
nations concluded after a weeklong meeting at UC Berkeley. "We need strong 
leadership to address the problem now," said Kenneth Davis, former deputy 
secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy and now a consultant for Bechtel 
Corp. "By the time it assumes a crisis proportion . . . it will be too late to 
do something about it."

PAUL AMADEUS PISK; 'MAN OF MUSIC,' SCHOENBERG PROTEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the last surviving students of renowned Austrian composer Arnold 
Schoenberg and Austrian musicologist Guido Adler has died at the age of 96. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Amadeus Pisk, an Austrian-American composer, pedagogue and musicologist, 
died at his Hollywood home late Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
With Pisk was his 71-year-old caretaker of nine years, Anna May Payne. 
</P>
<P>
Payne, who called Pisk "Papa," said: "What the world has lost is a great, 
wonderful man of music." A recurring back injury had left Pisk bedridden for 
the last 13 months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna in 1893, Pisk had been an accomplished pianist, composer, 
teacher and music critic for a newspaper before immigrating to the United 
States in 1936. Once here, Pisk taught at Dartmouth College, Washington 
University in St. Louis, University of Redlands, University of Texas at Austin, 
USC, UCLA and the University of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pisk's musical style, characterized by some experts as 
neo-renaissance, was not as popular as Schoenberg's, it was unique and widely 
respected by music scholars, said Dr. Ellis Kohs, a friend and colleague from 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his compositions, Pisk wrote numerous books and articles on 
music, said Nicolas Slonimsky, a friend and colleague of Pisk's. A founding 
member of the International Society for Contemporary Music, Pisk also belonged 
to the American Musicological Society, said Leonard Stein, director of the 
Arnold Schoenberg Institute at USC. 
</P>
<P>
A tribute concert of his work was held at Cal State Northridge on Pisk's 90th 
birthday, and the Schoenberg Institute at USC made Pisk an honorary life 
member, Stein said. Later this spring, Stein said, a concert will be held in 
Pisk's memory. 
</P>
<P>
Pisk is survived by a son, George, 55, of Austin, Tex.

JIM MURRAY: SUPER BOWLS MAY BE BLASE, BUT BEATING THE RAMS ISN'T

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams and 49ers. For it all. Or an all-expense trip to New Orleans, at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
Who will win? Well, let's see. The 49ers might be the way to bet. Except that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Seifert is not Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Montana is not God. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Craig is not Red Grange. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerry Rice is not two guys on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think. 
</P>
<P>
OK, you say, take the points. Go with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, first consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Robinson is not Knute Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett is not Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Bell is not Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flipper Anderson is not invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves us with -- what? Pick 'em? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know about you, but I've always had trouble taking the 49ers seriously. 
They always struck me as a team that didn't like to get dirty. If they were a 
baseball team, they wouldn't slide. In basketball, they'd be outside shooters; 
tennis, they'd stay at the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
They always seemed to roll up 28 quick points, then sit back and dare you to 
catch up to them. If you did, they just shrugged and went and had a drink. 
</P>
<P>
I always figured a game at Candlestick -- and Kezar before that -- was just a 
kind of complicated cocktail party, anyway. The whole town should have an olive 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
I was prepared to accept the 49ers as bona fide title types when they had Bill 
Walsh. He was perfect for San Francisco. The game was cerebral with him, sort 
of like grand opera in cleats. On the other hand, he wasn't entirely carefree. 
Somebody broke that nose. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco itself seemed to epitomize the old English canon, "No gentleman 
ever plays a game too well." 
</P>
<P>
I would have thought San Francisco would have been mortified to find itself in 
the (ugh!) Super Bowl. I mean, a Super Bowl was for ruffians such as the Green 
Bay Packers, New York Giants or teams known as the Steel Curtain or the 
Monsters of the Midway. The 49ers preferred to engage you at long range. In 
case you didn't wear your Brut. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not surprised they got rid of Bill Walsh. He seemed to be missing the 
point. The last thing -- good heavens! -- San Francisco wanted was a dynasty. I 
mean, good Lord, what are they -- the Gas House Gang or Murderers' Row or 
something common like that?! 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. San Francisco leaves vulgarities such as those to places such as Los 
Angeles, where they have sayings like, "Winning is the only thing." Winning 
comes way down the ladder in San Francisco. Way behind looking good losing, as 
a matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area teams don't particularly want to even go to the Rose Bowl. Screws up 
New Year's Eve at the country club, for one thing. They leave that to tacky 
types such as USC; they rely on Stanford and Cal to keep them home on New 
Year's. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco views L.A. through a lorgnette, anyway. As if it were someone who 
made noise eating soup, and left the spoon in and their hats on drinking 
coffee. Totally unsuitable for polite company, people who got rich through a 
flaw in the system. 
</P>
<P>
But now it finds itself with the best football team on the planet. And getting 
better. It's embarrassing. I mean, what is San Francisco? Green Bay or 
something? L.A.? You think San Francisco wants to be known as Titletown USA? 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco used to have exactly the kind of teams it wanted. Good, but not 
too. There were the John Brodie years, the Y.A. Tittle seasons. The Joe Perry, 
Hugh McElhenny, Frankie Albert eras. They won just enough to keep the tradesmen 
in their place. They lost with grace. They were like the Austrian cavalry. Too 
pretty to send to war. 
</P>
<P>
That was their role. But Joe Montana can't seem to get it through his thick 
head that winning not only isn't the only thing in San Francisco, it isn't 
anything. Doesn't he read Herb Caen, for cryin' out loud? 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was happier with someone such as Steve DeBerg. Steve DeBerg was 
perfect for San Francisco. Win a few, lose a few. Or lose a lot. Ciao. Let's go 
have a drink. 
</P>
<P>
Winning is for peasants. Or Southern Californians, which is the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
What does San Francisco need with a Super Bowl? It's got The Bridge. The Golden 
Gate. They make movies about San Francisco. Anybody ever make a movie about 
Duluth? Anybody ever leave his heart in Indianapolis? 
</P>
<P>
But here, they got a pretty dilemma. San Francisco probably doesn't really want 
to go to another Super Bowl. It's getting to be a bore. It comes too close on 
the heels of the golf at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, do they want those vulgarians from the south to have it? The 
place where the hills get brown in the summer and the most appalling people go 
around having lunch with each other, dressed up like farm hands? 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers may be the only team in America that has more fans outside its 
hometown than in. It's not that the 49ers are America's Team, it's just that 
they're not particularly San Francisco's team, either. 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers were from Green Bay or Pittsburgh or Cleveland or Dallas, there 
wouldn't be much doubt they were a juggernaut, a dynasty, a team for the ages. 
But, you notice, none of the coaches ever complains about the noise from the 
fans in Candlestick. That's because there isn't any. They're too busy 
unwrapping the quiche and uncorking the Chardonnay. The team is on its own in 
San Francisco. The audience watches as if it were "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
San Franciscans are probably not real clear on where Anaheim is, anyway. That's 
because when they do find themselves driving through Southern California, they 
close their eyes or have the chauffeur draw the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
If it were anybody else besides the Rams on the other side of the line of 
scrimmage today, I'd say take the spread and bet the house. But the Rams annoy 
San Francisco. They look like people who might eat the salad before the entree. 
They should be taught manners, put in their place. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the 49ers go to the Super Bowl again, there is a chance 
the city might ask them politely if they've given any thought to moving to 
Sacramento. The Super Bowl has ceased to be amusing.

CLIPPERS FIND BENCH IN LOSS AT END OF ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We interrupt this dynasty in the making for a flashback, Clipper style. 
</P>
<P>
From days of old comes a blowout, on the road and, for all intents and 
purposes, a double-digit loss. Thanks to the second team, the Clippers avoided 
the latter just in time to keep their streak alive of not having lost by 10 
points or more since Dec. 1, but that's the only victory to claim Saturday 
night. The win that mattered most, the game itself, belonged to the Chicago 
Bulls, 117-111, at Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A six-point loss? 
</P>
<P>
Only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"It proves our bench is better than their bench," Clipper forward Charles Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Starter against starter, the Bulls led by 30 in the second quarter, originally 
at 63-33, by which time the Chicago backcourt of Michael Jordan and John Paxson 
had 29 on their own. 
</P>
<P>
How this one slipped into the itinerary is anyone's guess. The Clippers, who 
opened what still has to be considered a wildly successful eight-game trip with 
a 5-2 record, took the two losses by four points to Detroit and one to New York 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the one that was anything but symbolic of recent Clipper fortune that 
they will return home with today. 
</P>
<P>
"We jumped on them and made them work," said Jordan, who finished with 28 
points and 10 assists. "We let them think about home. We let them think about 
going back to L.A., especially when it's so cold here." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers took advantage of a similar situation Dec. 26, trouncing Chicago, 
120-96, at the Sports Arena in the Bulls' final stop of a seven-game Western 
swing. Carbon-copy result, just a different winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the rematch, with the Bulls shooting 69.8% in the first two quarters and the 
Clippers looking like a textbook case of road weary, the hosts were ahead at 
halftime, 68-41. Chicago had a 37-point first quarter, the best start against 
the Clippers this season. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get much better in the third quarter for the Clippers, who pulled 
only as close as 21, 94-73. The starters were out, and no one seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Ron Harper, who scored 10 points, his lowest output since the Dec. 1 
loss at Phoenix. "I was happy. I was three steps slow and had no legs." 
</P>
<P>
So Coach Don Casey looked down the bench and found fresh bodies, which wasn't 
hard to do now that the Clippers have settled into an eight-man rotation on the 
trip. He left it to Michael Young, David Rivers, Jeff Martin, Joe Wolf and 
Benoit Benjamin to make it look good on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised how poised they were," Casey said. "It wasn't a relaxing 
situation for us. We were fighting for respectability on the scoreboard. We've 
had days of 25- and 30-point losses and didn't want that. We didn't think 
single digits, though." 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what they got. The same five played the entire fourth 
quarter and rallied the Clippers within 13, 111-98, when Wolf hit a six-foot 
hook with 4:03 remaining. Casey had Harper and Smith and Danny Manning, scorers 
all, on the bench, but stayed with the same lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking about it," the coach said. "Charles was stretching. But the 
first thing we said was, 'If they put their starters back in, we'll stick with 
you because you got us back in it.' We didn't want mass substitution." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Joe Wolf got 32 minutes and Smith went 25. Why Martin, growing in 
stature with each game, had 24 minutes and Harper played 27. Why Young went 16 
minutes compared to Manning's 21. 
</P>
<P>
They took advantage of the opportunity, too. Wolf had 17 points, tying Gary 
Grant for tops among Clippers, and 11 rebounds, equaling Chicago's Scottie 
Pippen for game-high honors. Young hit six of nine shots for 15 points. Rivers 
ran the team to 58% accuracy in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
And as for Benjamin being the lone starter kept in and playing 41 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
Just call it exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just going to work him until he dropped," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that dropped was the Chicago lead, far enough that Coach Phil 
Jackson was prompted to put Jordan and Bill Cartwright back in. The Clippers 
got as close as 117-111 on Young's layup with 16.3 seconds left, but there 
would be no miracles. The Clippers already had used their ration of 
improbability in the previous days. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's not the healthiest bunch returning today. Charles Smith is still bothered 
by a sore big right toe that sometimes forces him to run awkwardly. Tom 
Garrick, who missed the fourth game of the season with a sprained right knee, 
now has a badly bruised left knee, the condition of which worsened from Friday 
to Saturday. Indications are, however, that Ken Norman will return Tuesday 
against Charlotte after missing seven games of the trip, although no decision 
will be made until at least today and possibly even just before game time. The 
Clippers want him to sit out as long as necessary to heal a strained groin 
rather than having it nag for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego or Los Angeles Clippers have never won four road games in a row. 
No records were immediately available from their days as the Buffalo Braves. . 
. . The Bulls set a club record with their 13th consecutive home win. . . . The 
Clippers had another solid fourth-quarter defensive effort to get close, 
holding Chicago to 18 points in the final 12 minutes.

UCLA ZONE IS TWILIGHT FOR ARIZONA; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS OPEN THREE-GAME CONFERENCE LEAD ON WILDCATS BY 
SHUTTING DOWN THEIR INSIDE ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In case any doubt remained, UCLA proved again Saturday that Arizona is no 
longer the reigning bully in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
After a 73-67 loss before 12,312 at Pauley Pavilion, the Wildcats are no longer 
even the team to beat in the Pac-10, although for the moment they are ranked 
higher than any of their conference foes. 
</P>
<P>
That will change this week, when voters see that Arizona trails UCLA by three 
games in the conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins retained a share of the lead by ending a four-game losing streak 
against the two-time defending Pac-10 champions, who didn't have the outside 
firepower to bring UCLA out of a zone that stymied the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said he awoke Saturday morning and decided that he 
didn't want the Wildcats to do to the Bruins what they had done Thursday night 
to USC. 
</P>
<P>
In a 90-75 victory over the Trojans, the Wildcats pushed the ball inside and 
made 18 of 24 shots close to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Against UCLA, they found the inside was closed. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in the game was that we limited them inside, from block to 
block, where they really like to score," Harrick said. "They made some outside 
shots, but I thought we could overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't fear their guards as much as their inside players." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA took a 36-21 halftime lead as Arizona made only 30.8% of its shots. The 
Bruins then withstood a second-half rally by the Wildcats, who pulled even with 
five minutes to play but never took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting there as a coaching staff and I said, 'I just don't want them 
to get ahead,' " Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we kept them tied or behind, we felt that we would be in pretty 
good shape." 
</P>
<P>
By that, he meant that the Bruins would be able to stay packed inside, where 
they outrebounded the Wildcats, 39-29. 
</P>
<P>
How effective was the zone? 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's inside players -- Brian Williams, Wayne Womack, Sean Rooks, Brian 
David and Ed Stokes -- were a combined two of 12 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bruins rode the outside shooting of freshman Tracy Murray to a 
15-point halftime advantage. Murray scored 14 points in the first half, making 
five of 11 shots, including four of eight three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick was asked if he had given Murray a green light. 
</P>
<P>
"He can shoot whenever and from wherever he wants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, though, Murray went cold, missing his only three attempts, 
and Arizona turned up the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Matt Muehlebach made three three-point shots and Williams, the Wildcats' 
6-11 center, worked himself free inside on occasion, making four of five shots 
and scoring eight of his 10 points in the last 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jud Buechler, who led Arizona with 17 points and 14 rebounds, scored on 
a layup with 5:01 left to pull the Wildcats even, 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, took control from that point, putting together a 9-2 run to move 
ahead, 67-60, with 1:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona had a chance to cut the deficit to two points, or less, with 43 seconds 
left, but Buechler was called for charging when he collided with UCLA's Gerald 
Madkins while banking in a shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be anxious to look at the replay later," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Darrick Martin made four free throws for UCLA in the last 39 seconds, finishing 
with 11 points to join four teammates in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean led the Bruins with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Murray scored 16 
points. Madkins scored 12, making three of four three-point shots, and Trevor 
Wilson had 14 points, nine rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked our balance," Harrick said. "I've been waiting on balanced scoring 
like this all year long." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA improved to 11-2 overall and 5-0 in the Pac-10, ending Arizona's 
eight-game winning streak despite making only 43.3% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is 9-3 and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
What did the UCLA students think of Brian Williams, Arizona's 6-11 center from 
Santa Monica and a preseason All-American? "Overrated," they chanted. Williams 
had three rebounds in 24 minutes. . . . Keith Owens again started at center for 
UCLA, taking one rebound in 19 minutes. . . . Kevin Walker, who made 42 
consecutive starts for UCLA before being benched Thursday in favor of Owens, 
spent the entire game on the bench for only the seventh time in 106 games at 
UCLA.

MORNING BRIEFING: 49ER TIGHT END WILLIAMS PREFERS TO PLAY IT BY THE (COMIC) 
BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
Every NFL player has his own way of getting up for a game. San Francisco 49er 
tight end Jamie Williams reads comic books. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he reads Spiderman, Uncanny X-Man, Conan the Barbarian ("my 
medieval hero"), whatever it takes to get him psyched. 
</P>
<P>
"It works for me," Williams said after a practice for today's NFC title game 
against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys go out and get crazy during the week to deal with the stress of 
this job," Williams said. "Other guys sit in a dark room with no sound and no 
lights, or they've got to get real emotional in order to be prepared for a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I use comics. A lot of times they're about heroes trying to save the world or 
get the villain. That's what I visualize myself doing on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
Add 49ers: Bill Walsh, San Francisco 49er coach turned NBC analyst, said former 
coach Hank Stram used to pressure him for tips when Stram was an analyst for 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I told him our first play would be a reverse," Walsh said. "So on the 
air he says something like, 'I have a feeling they may run a reverse here,' and 
after we do, he's patting himself on the back for predicting it. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time he asked me to give him a play, I think I misled him, saying to 
myself, 'Let's see how he handles that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last add 49ers: Former Raider Matt Millen, playing for the 49ers, on why the 
Raiders should move back to Oakland: "Down there (in Los Angeles), in the 
middle of the third quarter with the score tied, 17-17, and one team driving, 
somebody yells, 'Surf's up!' and half the crowd leaves. Excuse me, but there's 
a game going on here." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Jan. 13, 1962, who won her third consecutive Australian Open? 
</P>
<P>
Clarification: Big Spring (Tex.) High has produced 11 active NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar daze: The New Jersey Nets will hold a ticket-discount promotion tonight 
to mark the return of former Net Buck Williams, who plays for the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Every fan who can prove his or her last name is Williams will 
get in for -- you guessed it -- a buck. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Margaret Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Bob McCammon, coach of the Vancouver Canucks, on playing four games 
in six days on an Eastern swing: "The schedule maker should come on a trip with 
us. Everything favors whoever screams the loudest and has seniority." GARR

ROMANIAN STARS NO LONGER ON RUN; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: ATHLETES TELL OF THEIR COUNTRY'S REVOLUTION AS THEY PREPARE 
FOR MEET AT THE SPORTS ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a bright sun streaming in on the warm breakfast room, slicing though dark 
clouds outside, talk of cruelty and torture and revolution seemed far removed. 
</P>
<P>
The three Romanian athletes were laughing at their ability to laugh, to find 
humor and hope in their experiences during their country's violent 11-day 
revolution that ended a day after Christmas. The three -- Paula Ivan, the world 
record-holder at one mile, Maricica Puica, former Olympic champion at 3,000 
meters, and Violeta Beclea, a rising star at 800 meters -- were having 
breakfast Saturday at a Los Angeles hotel. Their odyssey had taken them from 
Bucharest -- where the airport, heavily damaged in the fighting, "looked like 
Swiss cheese" Puica said -- to Warsaw, to Frankfurt, to London, and, after 23 
hours of travel, they had touched down here. 
</P>
<P>
Puica, the eldest and now a coach, had cried when she was greeted by old 
friends Friday night. It was like coming out of a dream, she told them. 
</P>
<P>
Now, retelling the horrors of the revolution that overthrew the 24-year regime 
of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Puica paused and wondered, "I can't believe that 
now we can laugh about it." 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe they are even here. Ivan and Beclea are here to run in 
the Sunkist Invitational track meet at the Sports Arena Friday night. Ivan in 
particular will be chasing the indoor world record for the mile, 4 minutes 18.6 
seconds, held by countrywoman Doina Melinte. Ivan ran 4:18.99 last season. Meet 
promoter Al Franken is offering $100,000 to the man or woman who can break the 
record at his meet. 
</P>
<P>
A big payday, ever the great incentive in amateur sports, is not the greatest 
incentive for the Romanians to be here. They are here because they are free to 
be here. 
</P>
<P>
And, after months of negotiations and agreements with the Romanian government 
and refusals by the government, Puica, Ivan and Beclea are nearly giddy about 
their freedom to travel where they wish. They might well have come here without 
the meet. 
</P>
<P>
All three live and train in Bucharest and each observed the revolution up 
close, while the rest of the world was watching it unfold on the evening news. 
Snipers, tanks in the streets and house-to-house fighting helped put sport in 
perspective at a time of social upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death. It was a war," Puica said through interpreter Valdimir 
Moraru. Moraru, who lives in Glendale, had been a sports writer in Romania for 
15 years before he defected in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I had strange and mixed feelings," she said. "Sometimes I felt like I was in 
the movies. Then I realized I could get shot. It was a kind of anarchy. Some 
civilians got weapons. Also, terrorists changed their clothes and you didn't 
know who was who." 
</P>
<P>
What had been horrible fighting, but far removed, became something else on Dec. 
21. On that day Romanians were beginning to hear about the massacre of 
thousands in Timisoara. Puica, Ivan and Beclea attended a rally with thousands 
of people in the Palace Square in Bucharest. Ceausescu addressed the crowd, 
which began to boo and shout, 'Give us our dead.' 
</P>
<P>
Never before had Romanians dared to jeer the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"Then someone came out and said, 'The Minister of Defense has committed 
suicide,' " Puica said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan quickly disagreed, "No, he was shot," she said. "People began to chant, 
'Down with Ceausescu.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was at that rally that many Romanians understood that what was happening in 
their country had moved from being isolated uprisings and unrest and had 
bloomed into a full-scale, bloody revolution. Standing there, in the 
electricity of the throng in the Palace Square, Ivan said that everything 
suddenly changed. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we were excited," she said of the new-found show of dissent. "Then we 
were frightened. It was easy to see that it was a revolution. The fighting 
started." 
</P>
<P>
Said Puica: "We were happy, but also scared to death. It was a profound sadness 
because people were dying and the number of dead was so many." 
</P>
<P>
Moraru repeated scenes that the women had described in which children had stood 
in front of tanks, saying there were not Fascists. "They crushed them like they 
were not there," he said. "You cannot imagine. They crushed them like they were 
not there." 
</P>
<P>
Puica, who understands some English, shakes her head when she hears this, still 
incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
One of the many battles in Bucharest was over control of the state-run 
television station. After civilians wrested control from the army, the station 
broadcast remarkable hours of a country being born: new leaders talking with 
army officers, asking them to lay down their guns, patriots, poets and common 
people speaking to the nation. Puica, a national sports hero, asked for time to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone drove me about half a mile and then people surrounded me and protected 
me and walked me to the TV station," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Puica spoke to her people of patriotism and freedom: "I am proud to be a 
Romanian and I'm proud of the youth of this country who sacrificed their lives 
to give freedom to the people. I did not give blood in the fighting, but I am 
going to give blood to the wounded. When I was an active athlete, I had many 
offers to defect. But I did not want it. I said, 'If we have to die, let us die 
together.' " 
</P>
<P>
That night, after she got home, Puica received a telephoned death threat. "The 
man said, 'I saw you on TV. You are going to see what happens to you.' I took 
it very seriously," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A byproduct of the seemingly random violence was the way in which it restricted 
movement. To venture out to buy bread, Puica said, was to mount a tactical plan 
that depended on speed, knowledge of the neighborhood, and not a small amount 
of luck. "Nobody put a (gun) to my head. But we knew we could be shot at any 
time. At any time." 
</P>
<P>
Without safe modes of transportation, there was uncertainty about the safety of 
family members in other parts of the country. Beclea, Puica and her husband, 
and Ivan and her husband were together in Bucharest and knew from day to day 
that all were safe. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan, however, grew worried about her parents, who lived 18 miles from the 
city. An army unit was holding the area and there were reports of fighting. 
Ivan and her husband finally drove to the village, through several civilian 
checkpoints, and found the family scared, but safe. 
</P>
<P>
Priorities were drastically rearranged. Even for world-class athletes, training 
became secondary. It was also unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"I did go to practice, but I did not know what to do," Beclea said. "I did not 
know if I should go or stay inside." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the revolution ended the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody celebrated Christmas," Puica said. "We were happy that we were free but 
everybody was thinking of the dead." 
</P>
<P>
Sad, but still defiant. Moraru told of a Romanian Christmas tradition of 
preparing an elaborate pork dish. This Christmas, there were no pigs to be 
slaughtered. "Houses were hanging banners that said, 'Christmas without the 
pig.' You know who the pig is." 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Eve was not festive, despite the fact that the "people" were solidly 
in control. Pockets of Ceausescu's security forces were still at large. "People 
were afraid of gathering together," Moraru said. "After they executed Ceausescu 
on Christmas Day, the security people still fighting sent out flyers, saying, 
'Christmas was yours, New Year's Eve will be ours.' There was still some 
isolated shooting last Wednesday when they left." 
</P>
<P>
Puica said that the Romanian people were moved by the world-wide response to 
their uprising. "We got tremendous, incredible help," she said. "We were 
overwhelmed by the response. I was impressed by the French. They were the first 
to react and send help. Some French journalist died in the fighting. They were 
the first to send food, medicine, milk for the kids. All the countries in 
Europe were helping." 
</P>
<P>
Now, sitting comfortably after breakfast, the women were clearly struggling 
with mixed emotions. Telling unbelievable stories of torture chambers and 
thousands of missing, while knowing it was all over but not forgotten. Sitting 
in sunshine while Romania experiences one of its harshest winters on record. 
Eating fruit while some Romanians have been without water. So many 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which was the greater emotion, the joy of freedom or the sadness of the 
cost, Puica said quietly, "Both." 
</P>
<P>
With that, they went quietly to find a place to train, the worst of their 
running behind them.

CAL LUTHERAN TRIED TO BUY OUT SHOUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran officials wanted to get rid of Bob Shoup to the extent that they 
offered him a $183,000 buyout of his position as football coach and as a 
tenured associate professor, a university regent confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, rejected by Shoup, was made in November after negotiations that 
would have allowed Shoup to coach for another year reached an impasse, 
according to Jim Tyner, a member of the Cal Lutheran Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Tyner said that Shoup had acquiesced to an Oct. 20 agreement under which Shoup 
would have coached the team for the 1990 season and then resigned. However, 
Shoup and Tyner said, the contract the school subsequently presented to Shoup 
on Oct. 31 differed in several ways from the previous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup was informed of his dismissal as football coach on Aug. 8, and the 
university reiterated its position Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, Shoup, the only head coach in the program's 28 years, filed a 
grievance that was turned down by the school's faculty grievance committee 12 
days later. BRENDAN HEALEY

BIG WEST CONFERENCE ROUNDUP;

<P>
UNLV REPELS TEMPLE'S LATE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With 3 minutes 47 seconds left Saturday at Philadelphia, Nevada Las Vegas 
seemed to have control of its nonconference game against Temple. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels had a 74-62 lead, and three Temple starters had fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game the seventh-ranked Rebels (10-3) surely would win. 
</P>
<P>
But Temple outscored UNLV, 12-2, to close within two points with 50 seconds 
left. Then Larry Johnson took over, making six consecutive free throws in the 
final 34 seconds as UNLV held on for an 82-76 victory over the Owls (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
"I just took my time, took a deep breath and got ready," Johnson said of his 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Each team was charged with 28 personal fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strange ballgame," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "I'm surprised we 
were leading at the half because we didn't shoot very well." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels held a 40-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
An NCAA investigation into an unpaid loan kept Anderson Hunt out of the Las 
Vegas lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on a university audit, it has been determined that junior guard Anderson 
Hunt has a school loan which has not yet been fully repaid," UNLV Assistant 
Athletic Director Joyce Aschenbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said it was a misunderstanding because he thought the loan had been 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State 77, San Jose State 72 -- Kendall Youngblood scored 15 points and the 
Aggies made the final six points at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Funk had 13 points for Utah State (9-6, 3-1), which outshot San Jose 
State, 59% to 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Kenne Young led San Jose State (4-9, 1-3) with 16 points and 13 rebounds, and 
Mike Wasserburger scored 14 points.

COACHES NEARLY COME TO BLOWS IN LSU VICTORY OVER KENTUCKY

<P>
A first-half confrontation between Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino and Louisiana 
State Coach Dale Brown marred the Tigers' 94-81 Southeastern Conference victory 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Jackson scored 28 points to lead No. 14 LSU, but a play involving Jackson 
ended in the coaches almost coming to blows. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:48 left in the first half, Kentucky's Jeff Brassow shoved Jackson, and 
Jackson retaliated with a forearm to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates separated the two, but not before Pitino and Brown went to the 
scorers' table to complain to officials. The coaches exchanged words. Pitino 
charged Brown and had to be restrained by an official. 
</P>
<P>
Brown prepared to hit Pitino, but assistant coach Craig Carse wrapped his arms 
around Brown and hustled him away. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Brassow were charged with intentional fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino said Brown shook his fist in a Kentucky player's face, then in his. 
Brown, however, said he believes Pitino staged the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was just trying to motivate his team," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino said: "I'm not going to tolerate anyone making a fist in one of my 
players' face. And then he got in my face with a fist." 
</P>
<P>
LSU played a diamond-and-one defense, putting Randy Devall on Derrick Miller, 
Kentucky's leading scorer. Miller, averaging 10 three-point shots, finished 
with seven points. 
</P>
<P>
LSU is 10-2, 3-1 in conference play. Kentucky is 6-8, 2-3.

ANTEATERS FIND WAY TO LOSE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again Saturday night, the "what-ifs" and "could-haves" piled up like the 
losses have this season for UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
What if Irvine hadn't turned the ball over a season-high 25 times against New 
Mexico State at the Bren Center? What if the Anteaters hadn't gone flat for 
five minutes late in the game? What if New Mexico State hadn't gone to the 
free-throw line 44 times, making 29? 
</P>
<P>
Could Irvine have knocked off New Mexico State? 
</P>
<P>
But those things happened and so Irvine lost to the Aggies, 88-75, before 
2,248. 
</P>
<P>
It was Irvine's eighth consecutive loss, three short of the school-record of 11 
set 10 years ago. The Anteaters drop to 2-13 overall, 0-6 in Big West 
Conference play. New Mexico State, leading the conference, is 14-1, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
For an all-too-brief time it appeared as if Irvine might snap out of its 
season-long doldrums and upset the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters cut a 13-point New Mexico State lead to just 62-59 with 8:46 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But after a timeout, New Mexico State regained its composure and turned the 
game into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-3 run in the next five minutes built the lead back to 77-62. 
</P>
<P>
Center James Anderson played particularly well for the Aggies, hitting all 10 
of his shots from the field for a game-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
He had six points, including a one-handed reverse fast-break dunk, during the 
Aggies' big run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not known as a shooter," Anderson said, "but I'm concentrating more." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hill had 14 points and Reggie Jordan 13 for the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ricky Butler, who made all seven of his shots from the field, had 19 
points to lead Irvine. Jeff Herdman added 17, Rod Palmer 16 and Jeff Von Lutzow 
15. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, whose shooting percentage had been hovering around the 40% mark, 
shot 50% for only the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot 50%, but you have to take away 25 possessions," Irvine Coach Bill 
Mulligan said, making reference to the Anteaters' 25 turnovers. "You can't turn 
it over against teams like that."

LOYOLA FINDS PACE TO ITS LIKING;

<P>
What, Paul Westhead worry? 
</P>
<P>
Nah. 
</P>
<P>
The man has seen a lot of baskets in his five years at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
So there was little cause for concern when an exuberant University of San Diego 
team began pressing his 23rd-ranked Lions Saturday night in front of a 
standing-room-only crowd listed at 2,500 in the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the pace was furious and the score was high, Westhead was happy. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount usually wins these games, and Saturday was no different. The 
final: Loyola Marymount 119, USD 112. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Lions' fourth consecutive victory, their second in the West Coast 
Conference. Loyola Marymount's 11-3 start equals its best ever. In 1987-88, the 
Lions started 10-3 and also defeated USD in the 14th game. They did not lose 
again until the second round of the NCAA Tournament and finished 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which lost its second in a row after a three-game winning streak, fell to 
6-9, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that pace," Westhead said. "I knew we were all right because the score 
was so high." 
</P>
<P>
"Sub-par," Lion forward Bo Kimble said of his team's performance. "I know we 
can play a lot better, but we've got to hand it to San Diego. They played well. 
They had us scouted well. They were prepared." 
</P>
<P>
USD lost to the Lions for the fifth consecutive time. In each, Loyola has 
scored more than 100 points. The Lions, second in the nation in offense with a 
117.6 average going in, hit the 100-point mark for the 12th time in 14 games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so unique that they make it hard for you to adjust," USD Coach Hank 
Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers led all scorers with 32 points, the first time he has led the 
Lions in scoring since a fainting incident Dec. 9 against UC Santa Barbara. 
Kimble, the nation's leading scorer, was nine under his season average with 28 
points. Jeff Fryer added 19. 
</P>
<P>
Dondi Bell had a career-high 20 points for USD. Craig Cottrell had 18, and John 
Jerome and Wayman Strickland added 17 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
USD scored the first six points as Loyola missed its first four shots. The 
Toreros held the advantage until Per Stumer made a three-point basket with 
12:20 left, giving the Lions their first lead, 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola took a 34-27 lead with 8:45 remaining in the half, but two layups by 
Cottrell, a five-footer by Bell and a layup byKelvin Woods, around a basket by 
Kimble, pulled USD to within 36-35. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland's free throws tied the score, 41-41, but Kimble quickly answered 
with a three-point basket to put Loyola back on top. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, the Lions rallied for nine consecutive points and took their 
biggest lead before halftime, 56-45, with 2:30 left.

CONNELLY'S FREE THROWS SINK WAVES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine usually needs all the troops it can muster against aggressive Santa 
Clara. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night at Toso Pavilion, the Waves were without three regulars for 
part of the game and starting forward Tom Lewis for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
They paid a price because Jeffty Connelly, who led Santa Clara with 18 points, 
made two free throws with five seconds remaining to give the Broncos a 72-70 
victory before an estimated 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was suspended indefinitely for missing curfew Thursday night after 
Pepperdine's game at the University of San Diego. Starters Craig Davis, Geoff 
Lear and top reserve Doug Christie were benched for about the first five 
minutes of the game, apparently for lesser offenses in the same curfew 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes was time enough for Santa Clara (4-11, 1-2) to jump to a 14-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
After its disastrous start, Pepperdine, which trailed at halftime, 34-26, got 
back in the game in the second half, largely through the efforts of Davis and 
Dexter Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who led the Waves with nine points in the first half, finished with 22. 
Howard scored a game-high 23 points, including a breakaway layup that gave 
Pepperdine (7-8, 1-1) its only lead of the night, 66-65, with 2:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
A layup by Lear, who finished with 10 points but only four rebounds, tied it, 
70-70. But then Connelly made his free throws, and Melvin Chinn, who had a 
career-high 15 points, stole the ball from Davis with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's 7-footer, Ron Reis, had 19 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that he would not expand on the reasons why he 
suspended Lewis and disciplined the others.

MONTANA IS CHAMP AT WAITING GAME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: FINAL-QUARTER HEROICS BY 49ER QUARTERBACK SET EXAMPLE FOR 
PROCRASTINATORS ANONYMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for Procrastinators Anonymous, Inc., Ltd., said last week that, 
although they may never get around to it, they would very much like to name a 
Procrastinator of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
And if they do, he said, they will select Joe Montana, the San Francisco 49ers' 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The Procrastinators Anonymous spokesman, who kept referring to his group by its 
familiar nickname, Pro An, said that in the past six months, "Joe has dillied 
and dallied so beautifully that the 49ers were still behind four times before 
winning in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, according to Pro An records, the 49ers in the past 10 years have 
been behind 19 times before winning in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe really ought to be the Procrastinator of the Decade," the spokesman said. 
"We've never had anyone else who fooled around that long before winning 19 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he said, the total is 24 games, counting the five times that Notre 
Dame came from behind in the fourth quarter with Montana. 
</P>
<P>
This year's runner-up in the Pro An poll is Jim Everett, the quarterback who 
rescued the Rams three times and came within three or four fumbles of rescuing 
them six times. 
</P>
<P>
In today's game, Everett will be out to catch Montana and become 
Co-Procrastinator of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal depends on who's ahead in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim has a shot at the single-season record, but he will never match Joe's 
career record," the Anonymous source said flatly. "I feel confident in 
predicting that in the next 100 years, you won't see any other football player 
make 24 big-time comebacks." 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of Pro An members -- few of whom, unfortunately, got 
around to voting -- Montana's best 10 comebacks include: 
</P>
<P>
1. 49ERS 20, BENGALS 16 
</P>
<P>
1989 SUPER BOWL 
</P>
<P>
With 34 seconds left, Cincinnati's 16-13 lead disappeared when split end John 
Taylor caught Montana's 10-yard pass in the end zone, ending a 92-yard 49er 
drive in the last three minutes. Actually, Montana sustained the drive for 107 
yards, overcoming a holding penalty with a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Jerry 
Rice on second and 20. The Bengals twice moved ahead in the fourth quarter, but 
Montana pulled it out with 12 completions in his last 15 throws for 222 yards. 
"It was my biggest comeback," Montana said last week. 
</P>
<P>
2. NOTRE DAME 35, HOUSTON 34 
</P>
<P>
1979 COTTON BOWL 
</P>
<P>
With 7 1/2 minutes left, Houston led Notre Dame, 34-12. In a Texas freeze, the 
Irish got 23 points on a blocked punt by Tony Belden, a run by Montana, a pass 
by Montana and two two-point conversion passes by Montana. The winning 
touchdown came on a last-second pass after Houston had missed on fourth and one 
at the Houston 29. The wind-chill reading was below zero when Montana, 
afflicted with hypothermia, started the second half in the locker room, where 
the doctors finally brought his temperature up. 
</P>
<P>
3. 49ERS 38, SAINTS 35 
</P>
<P>
1980 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, New Orleans led, 35-7. The 49ers, scoring the next four touchdowns 
and adding a field goal in overtime, became the only NFL team to come back from 
28 points down. In Coach Bill Walsh's second season, the 49ers began the rally 
with a touchdown run by Montana and two scoring passes. He directed a 78-yard 
drive to catch the Saints at the wire. The winning overtime drive was sustained 
for 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
4. 49ERS 28, COWBOYS 27 
</P>
<P>
1981 NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
</P>
<P>
In the 49ers' first NFC Championship game, Dallas was ahead with 51 seconds 
left, 27-21, when, on third and three, Montana raced to his right and threw the 
winning six-yard touchdown pass to Dwight Clark, who was also running to his 
right along the end line when he made what is now called "The Catch" in 49er 
lore. Five minutes earlier, Montana had begun a characteristic fourth-quarter 
drive, an 89-yard move that launched the 49ers' three-Super Bowls era. 
</P>
<P>
5. 49ERS 27, BENGALS 26 
</P>
<P>
1987 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
With six seconds left, Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche unknowingly borrowed a tactic 
that the University of Houston used, to its regret, against Montana's Notre 
Dame team in the '79 Cotton Bowl. The Bengals were ahead, 26-20, when they 
strangely tried a fourth-down run at the Bengal 30. They missed. Montana, on 
the next play, threw the winning touchdown pass to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
6. NOTRE DAME 31, PURDUE 24 
</P>
<P>
1977 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
Injured and out of football in 1976 -- after leading Notre Dame to big wins as 
a sophomore in 1975 -- Montana had dropped from second to third team as the 
Irish split their first two games in 1977. Then Purdue took a 24-14 lead into 
the fourth quarter. Coming on as Coach Dan Devine's third quarterback that day, 
Montana moved the Irish three times, ending a 17-point rally with a 58-yard 
drive to the winning touchdown with 1:39 left. Promoted to No. 1, he led Notre 
Dame past USC, 49-14, and on to the 1977 national championship. 
</P>
<P>
7. USC 27, NOTRE DAME 25 
</P>
<P>
1978 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
Because Montana was facing a clearly better team, this ranks over most of his 
fourth-quarter rallies. His defense couldn't hold the lead after Montana drove 
Notre Dame ahead, 25-24, in the last 46 seconds. Earlier in the fourth quarter, 
the Irish had seemed badly beaten, 24-6. The Montana surge in the last 12 
minutes started with a 57-yard touchdown pass play, continued with a 98-yard 
touchdown march and ended with a two-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
8. 49ERS 24, RAMS 21 
</P>
<P>
1988 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
En route to the Super Bowl, the 49ers made two impressive winning comebacks. In 
New Jersey, they were losing to the New York Giants in the last 42 seconds, 
17-13, when a 78-yard pass from Montana to Rice pulled it out. Then, in 
Anaheim, going into the fourth quarter, the Rams led, 21-17, when, on third and 
19, Montana started the winning 93-yard drive with a 31-yard completion. 
</P>
<P>
9. 49ERS 38, EAGLES 28 
</P>
<P>
1989 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
En route to today's NFC title game, the 49ers made fourth-quarter comebacks to 
beat Tampa Bay, New Orleans, Philadelphia and a Ram team that led by 17 points 
in the opening minutes, and again by 17 points in the final minutes. The most 
typical of the season's Montana comebacks was his four-touchdown fourth quarter 
in Philadelphia on Sept. 24. In the midst of it, the Eagles twice led by 11 
points, 21-10 and 28-17. The 49ers' fourth-quarter drives, all ending with 
Montana touchdown passes, went 91, 75, 47 and 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
10. MONTANA 1, BACK SURGERY 0 
</P>
<P>
1986 SEASON 
</P>
<P>
His quick return from early-season back surgery was the most unbelievable of 
all Montana comebacks, doctors still say. Some advised him to give up football 
forever after they discovered a congenital spinal stenosis when they operated 
for an acute ruptured disk. 
</P>
<P>
Injured at Tampa in the 49ers' opening game, Montana underwent surgery on Sept. 
15 and returned to football Nov. 9 with a startling performance against the St. 
Louis Cardinals, throwing three long touchdown passes to Rice. A week later, he 
completed 33 of 60 passes for a Montana-record 441 yards at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Procrastinators Anonymous has never forgiven him for getting 210 of the 441 
yards in the first half.

TELEVISION: MADDEN, WALSH TALK NOW, THEN LATER ON GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a pro football fan, it's pretty hard to beat today's fare. Not one 
but two championship games. 
</P>
<P>
You're going to be hearing analysis before, during and after both games, and 
the main men are Bill Walsh and John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, the NBC newcomer, knows a lot about the San Francisco 49ers, but 
circumstances dictate that he works the AFC game between the Cleveland Browns 
and the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has Madden, a former AFC coach, on the NFC game between the Rams and the 
49ers at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Both commentators were interviewed last week. First, Madden's views. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can the Rams beat the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of 
the year. If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and 
they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that. But 
I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little 
overconfident and maybe a little complacent? 
</P>
<P>
A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the Giants had won, they 
could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much 
respect for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
I've been working on my All-Madden team and have talked with some of the 49ers, 
and when I ask what team, besides the 49ers, is the best, every guy says the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should the Rams try to put a lot of pressure on Joe Montana? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did 
(Philadelphia's Randall) Cunningham. I don't think sacks, either way, are going 
to be a big thing in this game. What the Rams have to do more than anything 
else is tackle the receivers as soon as they catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
What they can't do is let Jerry Rice break away for a 70-yard touchdown after 
he catches a short pass, like he did against the Vikings. They can't let John 
Taylor break away like he did against them in that Monday night game. The Rams 
look like they're tackling better since that game. 
</P>
<P>
You're not going to shut out Rice and Taylor. But when they do catch the ball, 
you've got to tackle them, put the clamps on 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You grew up with John Robinson in Daly City, Calif. He has been your 
lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching 
the Oakland Raiders. Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being 
a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully. It's just that I know John as 
well as anybody. He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running 
backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached 
in this league. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now 
has, passing is the way to go. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, not 
when you have guys like Jim Everett and Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard. 
They've even been working Ron Brown into the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the 
best is going to win this game. The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
What the 49ers have to do is help Montana get into his rhythm. If he does that, 
the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had 
to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, 
the Giants and 49ers. And they've already done half of that. 
</P>
<P>
And now from Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The last two times Denver and Cleveland met for the AFC championship, the 
Broncos won both times, first on a 15-play, 98-yard drive and then when the 
Browns' Earnest Byner fumbled on the three-yard line. Might the Browns be a 
little gun-shy? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about 
making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let 
it fly. It's up to (Coach) Bud Carson to keep the team loose, and it's up to 
(owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in 
this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active. 
Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the receivers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup. 
Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out 
of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group. 
</P>
<P>
We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game. He knows his 
people so well. He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also 
quick, and more dependable. Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best 
routes. He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, 
Young is the guy Elway likes to go to. They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, 
but he's good going downfield. And Steve Sewell, like Metcalf for the Browns, 
is good coming out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the 
NFC. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, Cincinnati came close to the 49ers last year (the Bengals lost, 
20-16), so that shows anything can happen. But there is no question the NFC is 
the stronger, more physical conference.

GLANVILLE HAS BEEN HIRED TO COACH LAST-PLACE FALCONS, PAPER REPORTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons will announce today that Jerry Glanville, who recently 
resigned as coach of the Houston Oilers, has been hired as Falcon coach, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution reported in a copyright story 
that the announcement would be made at a news conference. Falcon officials 
weren't available to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville, an assistant coach with the Falcons from 1977 to 1982, would succeed 
Marion Campbell, who retired with four games left in the season. Jim Hanifan 
served as interim coach, but was told that no member of the current staff would 
get the job. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons finished 3-13, and have the first selection in the 1990 NFL draft. 
The Falcons have finished last in the NFC West five of the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville, 48, resigned from the Oilers Jan. 6 after Houston lost the AFC 
wild-card game at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville had a 35-35 record in four seasons at Houston, after going 0-2 in 
1985 when he was hired as interim coach. His playoff record with the Oilers was 
2-3. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it couldn't reach Taylor Smith, Falcon executive vice 
president, or Ken Herock, vice president for player personnel, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said sources close to Glanville and high-ranking league sources 
in Denver for Sunday's AFC Championship game confirmed he had been offered and 
accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville's wife, Brenda, told the newspaper only that her husband was "out of 
pocket" for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville had an interview in Atlanta two days before he left the Oilers. The 
Falcons also interview Joe Bugel, an assistant with the Washington Redskins, 
and were thought to be interested in Mike Holmgren, offensive coach of the San 
Francisco 49ers, who play host to the Rams in the NFC Championship game today.

AFC PLAYOFF NOTEBOOK;

CARSON EXPECTS BRONCOS TO BE IN A HURRY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In light of the chaos caused by the Buffalo Bills' unexpected no-huddle offense 
last week, Cleveland Brown Coach Bud Carson spent the week preparing for more 
of the same today from the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bills found a couple weak spots, and they exploited them. We didn't do a 
very good job adjusting to them," Carson said. "They not only used a hurry-up 
game on us, they used an even more effective hurry-up game in that they weren't 
even audibling at the line of scrimmage. They were getting lined up and running 
plays quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Jim Kelly passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns against Cleveland 
and nearly won the game before Clay Matthews intercepted a pass at the goal 
line with three seconds left to preserve the Browns' win. One play earlier, a 
potential touchdown pass glanced off the hands of Ronnie Harmon in the left 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's first touchdown came on a no-huddle play that created confusion among 
Cleveland's defenders. Matthews was feverishly trying to call a timeout as the 
ball was snapped, and Kelly proceeded to hit a wide-open Andre Reed over the 
middle for a 72-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Though Denver attempted to use a hurry-up offense without much success in a 
16-13 loss to the Browns in Cleveland on Oct. 1, Carson said he'd be surprised 
if the Broncos didn't try of it today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anticipating 90,000 no-huddles. Our whole practice has been no-huddles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns are seeking their first Super Bowl appearance. The Broncos are after 
their third appearance in four years and fourth overall. They are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Denver had a 1,000-yard rusher and a 3,000-yard passer in the same season for 
the first time. Its attack is more balanced than Cleveland's. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway will supplement the passing game with Bobby Humphrey, who rushed for 
1,151 yards as a rookie and scored eight touchdowns. He is effective inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Elway did not have an outstanding season, but he did pass for 3,051 yards and 
18 touchdowns. He also threw 18 interceptions and was the team's third-leading 
rusher with 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's defensive backs excel at going for the ball -- the Browns led the 
AFC with 27 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The only snow fans at the game are likely to see will be capping the mountains 
in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today is mild and breezy, with increasing afternoon clouds and 
high temperatures in the low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect football weather," said weather service meteorologist Joe Baskin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool enough for the players to enjoy it, and enough breeze to blow all 
the smoke out of the stands. Just a really nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said snow could follow on the heels of the game, however, perhaps on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for the ticker-tape parade," he said.

RAISE A STANZA LANDS IN RIGHT SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entered in both the San Carlos Handicap and San Fernando Stakes this weekend, 
Raise A Stanza wound up in the right one. 
</P>
<P>
Thought by many to be at his best as a late-running sprinter, the 4-year-old 
colt by Raise A Man came flying Saturday and overhauled favored Oraibi to win 
the $109,500 San Carlos before 25,214 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoying the rain and slop and helped by a :44 half-mile, the 8-1 shot defeated 
Oraibi by three-quarters of a length while covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth in the opening-day Malibu, Raise A Stanza had already shown an affinity 
for the poor track. 
</P>
<P>
"He won on a hard, sloppy track at Hollywood when he was 2," trainer Jay 
Robbins said. "He handled it then and he handled it great today. 
</P>
<P>
"We trained him for this race and shortened him up. But Flying Continental (who 
is entered in the San Fernando) came up with an infection Thursday and was 
100-1 to make it in time (today). 
</P>
<P>
"If it didn't look like Flying Continental was going to be ready, we were going 
to scratch Raise A Stanza today and run him in the San Fernando. He might have 
won tomorrow, but now it looks like the other one will make it. I hope it's 
another lousy day." 
</P>
<P>
Raise A Stanza provided Russell Baze with his second stakes victory of the 
meeting. Last Sunday, he and Invited Guest came from far back to post a 
surprise in the San Gorgonio. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay said he didn't like dirt in his face, but he loves mud," Baze said. "Last 
time, he had his head up in the air. This time, he just put his head down and 
ran right into the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth early on, Oraibi, the 2-1 choice, drew clear on the backstretch after 
the inside opened up, and was three lengths better than Tanker Port at the 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure I didn't get trapped," Laffit Pincay said. "Then, he 
opened up on his own. He switched leads good in the stretch and I thought he 
would hang on. But he pinned his ears at the sixteenth pole." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect, who would have been the favorite, was scratched when the 
rains came. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't like the track when it 's got water on it," trainer John Sadler 
said. "This was an optional race for him anyway. He had three tough races in a 
short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in eight days, Eddie Delahoussaye will meet with the 
stewards this morning to discuss a disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
After Excellent Lady was disqualified in the third race Jan. 5, Delahoussaye 
was absolved of blame by Santa Anita stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and 
Hubert Jones and escaped a five-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
In the third race Saturday, Delahoussaye was disqualified aboard Field Of View 
for bothering McGruff in the final sixteenth. To many observers, it appeared 
The Maheras Case, who finished third in the $25,000 claimer, came out and was 
more responsible for McGruff's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I came in, don't get me wrong," Delahoussaye said. "If I'm not 
mistaken, I grabbed him and pulled him right off the other horse and rode him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"I did make contact (with McGruff), but I don't think it's all my fault, 
either. I'm not denying the horse in the middle didn't get bothered, but I 
attribute the trouble more to the inside horse than my horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I don't get days for this. If I do, the other guy (Pat Valenzuela, who 
rode The Maheras Case) should also." 
</P>
<P>
Seven 4-year-old fillies were entered in Monday's $108,900 El Encino Stakes 
Saturday morning, but all the attention in the mile-and-a-sixteenth race will 
be on Gorgeous and Akinemod. 
</P>
<P>
Idle since finishing second to Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, Gorgeous 
has worked well for her return despite the less than flashy clockings. A winner 
of five of eight lifetime, the Slew O'Gold filly is widely viewed as the class 
of her division. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind won the Eclipse Award as the nation's best 3-year-old filly -- 
deservedly so -- but Gorgeous was the better horse at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The bad weather could delay her seasonal debut, but Delahoussaye is hopeful 
she'll be a participant Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"She looks great and she's training well," he said. "I'd sure like to see her 
run." 
</P>
<P>
After rattling off five consecutive sprint victories, including wins in the 
Cascapedia and La Brea Breeders' Cup Stakes, Akinemod will try two turns for 
the first time in the El Encino, the middle leg of the La Canada series. 
</P>
<P>
Rider Gary Stevens thought the daughter of Time To Explode would handle extra 
distance after the La Brea and he's also fairly confident she'll take to the 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she'll run on broken glass if she needs to," Stevens said. "Whether or 
not they'll run on an off track is sure hard to predict. This horse I rode 
today (Candi's Gold, who finished seventh in his comeback in the San Carlos) 
always handled it before, but today he acted like a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
"Akinemod's on top of her game. I'd just as soon not run against Gorgeous, but 
if she's able to beat her, then she's unbelievable. I think Akinemod's a top 
filly and (trainer) Jerry's (Fanning) trying to keep from getting too excited." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the lineup include Fantastic Look, who won the Fantasy last spring at 
Oaklawn Park and most recently was second to Akinemod in the La Brea, Reluctant 
Guest, Kelly, idle since finishing fourth in the Del Mar Oaks, Affirmed Classic 
and Luthier's Launch.

TRUMP PLANS BIG COMPLEX ON AMBASSADOR HOTEL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald J. Trump, the brash and controversial builder from Manhattan, announced 
plans in Los Angeles on Saturday that apparently would lead to the demolition 
of the historic Ambassador Hotel as part of a mammoth commercial and 
residential redevelopment expected to cost more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Trump also confirmed that his plans may include construction of the nation's 
tallest building -- 125 stories -- on the hotel site, nearly 24 acres in the 
mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be Trump's first on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, 43, revealed his plans at a packed news conference at the 69-year-old 
hotel, once an elegant gathering spot for the rich and famous and perhaps best 
known as the site of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in 1968. The hotel 
closed a year ago after decades of decline. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's announcement was only the first step in what promises to be a long 
and grueling process to get the project approved and built. Trump estimated 
that the effort could take as long as five years. 
</P>
<P>
His plans are likely to trigger opposition among preservation groups, who do 
not want the venerable hotel demolished, and Los Angeles education officials, 
who want the site for a 2,000-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
Trump claimed the Ambassador is too run-down to renovate and the property too 
expensive to use for a school. 
</P>
<P>
A news release from Trump's company said: "Buildings of architectural 
distinction and true California style will replace the unsafe and antiquated 
structures." When asked directly if the Ambassador might be saved as part of 
the project, Trump said that was "very unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said Saturday that 
the district remains firm in its resolve to use the site for a school and would 
condemn the property through eminent domain if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the higher cause here is a school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservation group, also probably will oppose 
Trump's plans because of its interest in preserving the Ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
"We still feel it would be possible to re-use the historic structures as part 
of a new project," conservancy director Jay Rounds said after the news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
What happens to the Ambassador property is critical to the planned restoration 
of the mid-Wilshire business district, whose importance as a commercial center 
has been overshadowed in recent years by downtown Los Angeles and areas farther 
west on Wilshire Boulevard. The Ambassador site is one of the last large open 
spaces left in urban Los Angeles that is available for large-scale development. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did not detail what his project would contain, saying that he is three 
months away from unveiling specific plans. Several well-known architects are 
now developing plans for the site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump did say that the development probably will include a combination of 
apartments, condominiums, a hotel, offices, retail shops and a large ballroom 
known as the Cocoanut Grove, named after the Ambassador's nightclub that was so 
popular in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to a mixed-use project that will have the stature of a 
Rockefeller Center (in New York)," said Scott Malkin, one of Trump's partners. 
The development will cost "well in excess of $1 billion," Malkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, in an interview after the news conference, confirmed that the project 
might include a 125-story office building. The 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago 
is currently the nation's tallest office tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of Los Angeles would like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Tom Bradley and City Councilman Nate Holden, both of whom joined 
Trump for his news conference, oppose that idea, believing a building of that 
size is inappropriate for that location. "I don't think that's a good idea," 
said Holden, in whose district the Ambassador is located. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also declined to pass judgment on Trump's overall plan. In a news 
release, he said, "I have not seen the plans for Mr. Trump's proposed 
development, so I can't comment on the specifics of the project." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's news conference generally was marked by goodwill, with lots of hype 
mixed in. Others attending included City Council President John Ferraro and 
several American and European developers who are Trump's partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to working with you . . . on a mixed-use development that is 
responsive to the needs of all the people," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did it take you so long to get to Los Angeles?" Ferraro quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has acquired an interest in Wilshire Center Partners, which bought the 
hotel property last year for $64 million. The partnership has been renamed 
Trump Wilshire Associates, with Trump as the managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Trump declined to disclose how much he paid for his investment, saying only 
that it was a "substantial amount" that would get larger with time. It is 
believed, however, that he paid between $12 million and $13 million for a 20% 
interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
Trump made his mark on the East Coast during the 1980s with high-profile 
developments in Manhattan and Atlantic City. He currently is building the 
world's most expensive casino hotel, the $1-billion Taj Mahal, at the eastern 
end of the Boardwalk in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
But, sometimes, there is a gulf between what Trump says he wants to do and what 
actually happens. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he has been trying since 1984 to develop a huge parcel of land on 
the upper West Side of Manhattan that is to have apartment towers, shopping 
malls, offices and a 150-story office building. The proposed development 
remains bogged down in controversy and local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Trump has not always been so bullish on Los Angeles. "I'm really 
concerned with the whole earthquake situation in L.A.," he told The Times in 
1988. "I am a tremendous believer that someday Las Vegas may be the West 
Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Trump expressed no such doubts. What about earthquakes and their 
effect on a 125-story building? "It's no problem," he replied, adding that his 
buildings would survive.

FIRST ELECTED BLACK GOVERNOR TAKES HIS OATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RICHMOND, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence Douglas Wilder, the grandson of slaves, stood here Saturday in the 
one-time capital of the Confederacy and took the oath of office as governor of 
Virginia -- the first elected black governor in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Bracing against a bright winter chill, Wilder, 58, a Democrat and one-time 
Richmond lawyer who served a term as lieutenant governor before winning the 
state's highest office last November, conceded during his inauguration speech 
that it was a moment to savor. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago, I said to the people of Virginia that I was proud to be a 
Virginian," he told the heavily black overflow crowd that had crammed into the 
courtyard of the state Capitol for the historic outdoor swearing-in ceremony. 
"That pride does burst forth (again), and lifts my voice and my spirit to 
proclaim, 'I am a son of Virginia.' " 
</P>
<P>
The installation of the nation's first elected black governor was a particular 
point of pride to the blacks who had traveled here from all over the state -- 
and the nation -- to see Wilder take the oath. State Police estimated that 
25,000 to 30,000 people jammed into the 2-block-long square. 
</P>
<P>
"History is being made here in Richmond -- of all places," said Evelyn Walker, 
a 68-year-old retired schoolteacher and veteran of the civil rights era who 
brought her grandchildren to witness the inaugural ceremonies while sitting on 
the base of a statue of Confederate Gen. Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott A. White, 69, a black from Newport News, Va., one of the sections of 
the state that voted heavily for Wilder, agreed. "Twenty years ago, this just 
wouldn't have been possible," White told bystanders while the crowds were 
gathering for the ceremony. "This is really a breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the initial chill, which gave way to a slight warming as the ceremony 
got under way at noon, the inauguration had a festive air. Thousands had to 
wait two hours or more in order to get a place on the Capitol grounds. Many 
spent the time bantering and chatting, often about the earlier days of the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, spectators clapped to the music of an Army band. A 19-gun 
salute from ceremonial cannons startled some in the crowd at first, but left 
most of them beaming. 
</P>
<P>
The inauguration had implications, however, that went beyond both the symbolism 
and the ceremony. Many analysts believe that Wilder's campaign may have pointed 
the way to a new form of black politics -- the shift by black politicians 
toward a more "mainstream" image designed to win white votes as well. His 
pro-choice stance on abortion also helped propel him to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's quiet, low-key approach contrasted sharply with the more flamboyant, 
and more ethnic-oriented, Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose image ultimately proved a 
liability when he was running against Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and 
several other candidates for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder aides asked Jackson to stay away during last year's campaign. On 
Saturday, the former presidential contender made an early morning appearance at 
an interdenominational prayer service that Wilder's camp had organized, but he 
was not visible during the inauguration. Jackson praised Wilder's election as 
"a great world story." 
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, both Wilder and his opponent, moderate Republican 
J. Marshall Coleman, the state's attorney general, took pains to avoid any 
outright reference to the race issue, although many had expected racially 
oriented rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the campaign grew ugly in early autumn as both candidates attacked 
each others' personal integrity over their stands on issues ranging from 
financial disclosure to their positions on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's victory was so razor-thin that it prompted a re-count that was not 
fully resolved until a few weeks ago, when Wilder was declared the victor by 
just 6,741 votes out of more than 1.7 million cast. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ceremonies Saturday came amid a weekend of lavish galas, 
receptions and network television appearances that together may have set a 
record for spending in Virginia's relatively staid political environment. 
</P>
<P>
Security was unusually tight, partly reflecting apprehension in the wake of the 
recent spate of bombings -- linked to white supremacist groups -- in several 
Southern states. But police said they had received no threats of violence, and 
the inauguration was free of any incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder was sworn in by former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. 
Also taking office were Lt. Gov. Donald S. Beyer Jr., a northern Virginia car 
dealer and political novice, and Atty. Gen. Mary Sue Terry, who won reelection 
last year. Both are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically, the new governor passed up the opportunity to deliver a 
stem-winding speech. He avoided virtually any allusion to civil rights issues, 
pledging only to work to serve "all Virginians" and revived his talk of the 
"New Mainstream" -- a theme that enabled him to win last November in a 
tradition-conscious Southern state whose electorate is 85% white. He also 
warned of possible economic problems ahead for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Just after his inauguration, Wilder signed his first executive orders -- one 
calling for "equal employment opportunity" in the state, and a second 
proclaiming the 1990s to be the decade of youth and family. "Hopefully, 
everything we do will reflect how we feel about it (youth and family)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the birthday of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., Wilder will deliver his first address to the state General Assembly, where 
he is expected to outline his legislative program for the year.

IMMIGRANTS: CEAUSESCU'S DOWNFALL HAS LIBERATED ROMANIANS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
WHO HAD TREATED EACH OTHER AS IF THEY WERE SPIES FOR THE DICTATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 28 years spent in political prisons or under the scrutiny of Romanian 
secret police, Nicolae Popa arrived in Southern California expecting to find a 
place where he could speak openly about his hatred for communism. 
</P>
<P>
But two days after he settled in Pico Rivera, a fellow Romanian taught Popa his 
first lesson about freedom in America: "If you want to have a good life here, 
keep away from other Romanians," the 58-year-old electrical contractor said he 
was told. 
</P>
<P>
Like others before him, Popa soon realized that, even here, fears of spies and 
secret police would continue to foster the mistrust prevalent in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a Romanian community in Southern California that cannot 
properly be called a community. In a region where immigrants of all 
nationalities manage to recreate the ethnic flavor of home, there is no 
bustling Little Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, Romanian immigrants believe their community is on the verge of 
an emancipation, mirroring in a smaller way the liberation of their country 
after the recent overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu's Communist dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since they settled in Southern California, immigrants say 
they are beginning to witness an unprecedented openness. Already Romanians here 
who once refused to join anti-communism demonstrations are trumpeting their 
pro-democracy sentiments to anyone who will listen in gatherings in Westwood 
and on the steps of City Hall. Those who once were afraid to celebrate Mass can 
be seen filling church pews, church officials say. And Romanian acquaintances 
are embraced instead of greeted with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing," Popa said. "When many of us left Romania we were kind of 
brainwashed. The government told us, 'We will let you leave, but watch what you 
do because our hands are long enough to reach you and you still have families 
here.' Now, like in Romania, we have no fear. We can talk free against the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Romanian-Americans also have banded together to raise money and 
send food, medical supplies and clothing back to their native country. 
</P>
<P>
This, they say, is only the beginning. Today, where there are no support 
services, no large Romanian community groups and little information to help 
immigrants settle in other countries, they hope one day there will be 
organizations and relief services. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 Romanians live in the Los Angeles area, scattered in 
neighborhoods ranging from Santa Monica to Bell with no definable Romanian 
settlements, shopping strips or markets. The only places where more than 50 
Romanians could be found together, immigrants say, were the churches. 
</P>
<P>
The one Romanian organization in Los Angeles, the 65-year-old Romanian Cultural 
Society, revolves around the Romanian Orthodox Church and church activities. 
The group has about 200 members and meets once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three restaurants that serve Romanian food in Los Angeles, only one, 
Felicia Zanescu's Hollywood establishment, Mignon, displays a visible sign of 
Romanian heritage: the flag of red, yellow and blue hangs on a pole outside. 
</P>
<P>
But until the execution of Ceausescu, good Romanian food such as goulash and 
stuffed cabbage was about all Zanescu's customers received. Zanescu did not 
chat at great length with her patrons, believing any one of them could be a 
Communist spy. 
</P>
<P>
"Not now," she said. "Now I speak freely." 
</P>
<P>
For immigrants like Sorin S. Pricopia, 40, a stunt coordinator in Hollywood who 
has lived here for 19 years, the transformation in his home country means he 
can now write letters to the editor and sign them without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks he has written three letters to the editor. In the 18 
years before that, he had written only two, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Greta Lonita, 26, who escaped from Romania when she was 15, the death of 
the Communist regime means she can discuss politics on her own telephone. There 
will be no more runs to the pay phone because of her suspicions that her home 
telephone might be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
And for Nicolae Focseneanu, 44, a dental technician in Huntington Park who said 
he used to test each immigrant he met with prickly political questions, 
Romania's liberation means he can be less afraid that the person sitting next 
to him is a spy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now begins a new era not only for the people in Romania, but for the Romanians 
in exile," said Cornel Dumitrescu, the co-editor of New York-based "The Free 
World," the largest Romanian newspaper outside Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Said Father Cornel Avramescu, pastor of one of Southern California's largest 
Romanian Orthodox Churches, located in Tustin: "Our problem lies with unity in 
the mind. That is what we have not had and that is what kept us from becoming 
close to one another. Now I believe we truly will learn to be unified." 
</P>
<P>
All immigrants agree, however, that a new cohesive community will not happen 
without great effort. Forty-five years of Communist oppression and its 
repercussions cannot be shed as simply as an old suit, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have lived with mistrust for a lifetime, it is hard to overnight 
become trusting," said Mihail Badica of Bell. "I really hope we will come 
together, but when and how, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad reality among us," said Father Liviu Olah, who is the pastor of 
one of Southern California's largest Romanian Baptist Churches, located in 
Bellflower. "We have been taught not to talk to one another. We can never know 
who is a traitor, or who is a friend. It has been that way for so many years, 
mistrust is now second nature to us. It is a reflex." 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 Romanians are allowed by the U.S. government to immigrate to the 
United States each year, according to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. Many others risked death by immigranting illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants insist that, at some point, security forces and Romanian spies 
picked up their trails and watched them, sometimes even trying to harm them. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's government agents "really worked hard to keep us divided," said the 
Rev. Father Alecse Constantin, pastor of the Holy Trinity Romanian Orthodox 
Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Constantin and other immigrants say Communist agents were seen in California at 
church services and small gatherings of Romanians. Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove), who has aided several Romanians resettling in the United States, said 
it is widely believed that the Ceausescu government sent false defectors to 
infiltrate Romanian immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Georghe Calciu, an Orthodox priest living in Washington who spent 21 
years in political prison in his native land and who is regarded by many 
Romanian immigrants as their moral leader, maintains that would-be assassins 
directed by Ceausescu twice tried to poison him in the last four years. Shortly 
before the revolution, he said, he was warned by two FBI agents that Ceausescu 
had sent agents after him. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez would not comment on Calciu's claims. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants point to other evidence to support their claims that they were being 
watched by Ceausescu's security agents. 
</P>
<P>
Avramescu said that, six months ago, he was visited by a parishioner who told 
him she could no longer attend church services because she had been threatened 
by secret police while visiting relatives in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told him she believed her relatives would be harmed if she went to 
Mass every Sunday. At most, she said, she could come once a month. But until 
the revolution broke out, Avramescu never saw her again. On Christmas Day, the 
day Ceausescu was reported to be under arrest, the woman came back to his 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody understood what was going on in our country and what it 
was doing to us," Avramescu said.

Every night the choppers rise from their landing pads and spread across the 
L.A. Basin. Squadrons of them, sortie after sortie, all loaded with liquid 
death for the Medfly. Every night for five months now they've poured malathion 
from the skies, trying -- entomologically speaking -- to bomb the Medfly back 
to the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
We accept this annual war in California. It is one of the peculiarities of life 
here that we can wake up in the middle of the night, hear the whump whump of 
the choppers overhead, and know immediately what's happening. Just one more 
layer of sticky poison coating the neighborhood. One more night of carpet 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
We accept it, I think, because we understand the stakes involved. The domino 
theory probably was hogwash when it came to the commies, but it's not hogwash 
with the Medfly, or the Oriental fruit fly or the Mex fly. If any of those 
creatures establish a firm beachhead in the L.A. Basin, the San Joaquin Valley 
and all of California agriculture surely will be next. 
</P>
<P>
And we accept it for another reason: This war has always ended in victory. The 
chopper season arrived, the malathion went down, and the Medfly died. It is a 
strategy that worked. 
</P>
<P>
Except this year. For reasons that no one understands, the war is going badly 
this year. Very badly. We have escalated our response, sending more and more 
choppers into the night sky, expanding the war zone week after week. Now we 
find ourselves fighting over a huge territory, 300 square miles, and still the 
Medfly has not succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
All this became clear last week when some of the top Medfly scientists decided 
to go public with their fear that the war in L.A. may be unwinnable. In a story 
by Times reporter Maura Dolan, a UC Berkeley entomologist expressed his view 
this simply: "I don't think they will be able to (eradicate)." 
</P>
<P>
A scientist from out of state agreed and added this: "Once you have an 
established population -- and I would say the evidence in L.A. is that it is 
pretty well established -- it (eradication) is very unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
These scientists are outside the program. Inside the program, as might be 
expected, you still get optimism of the light-at-the-end- of-the-tunnel 
variety. One of the inside scientists, when asked if the Medfly would be 
vanquished by next autumn, replied, "Possibly." 
</P>
<P>
Next autumn. That's eight, nine months from now. By then the air war will be 
more than a year old; it will have spanned two Medfly seasons. Some 
neighborhoods will have been sprayed a dozen, two dozen, times. The toll on 
humans will be uncertain and unknown, but the toll on other creatures such as 
ladybugs, butterflies and honey bees will be serious. This is not a benign war, 
and that reality is starting to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
So, with the war going badly, with the ladybugs and butterflies dying, it would 
be easy to heap scorn on the commanders of the spraying war. You could argue 
that L.A. has paid too high a price to protect the farmers of the San Joaquin. 
Let the farmers fight their own war, you could say. Let the dominoes fall. 
</P>
<P>
You could say that, but you shouldn't. If we lose the air war in L.A., all of 
California will be caught in a true nightmare. Here in the Basin, a permanent 
infestation would mean a permanent war. Not an air war, perhaps, but a war in 
every back yard where there are fruit trees. Over the years more malathion 
would be sprayed by homeowners than is coming now from the choppers. 
</P>
<P>
And a permanent infestation in the San Joaquin would mean a permanent taint on 
California produce. Apples, pears, peaches, plums, grapes -- everything would 
be run through fumigators before it left the state and everything would be 
suspect. Make just one mistake and a nervous country like Japan would shut its 
doors to California farm products as it did during the 1981 Medfly war. It cost 
$100 million that time and it lasted only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a good idea, then, to win this war. That means we have to keep the 
choppers in the air whether or not things look shaky. And if we win this time, 
there is reason to believe future battles may be easier. The government is 
beefing up its production of sterile fruit flies and within two years they will 
be available as substitutes for much of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But, as with Vietnam, the generals of the bug war are facing an erosion of 
public will. It's my guess that L.A. will not tolerate aerial poisons from now 
till autumn. The generals don't have that much time. They must show some 
progress, show they can win, and show it soon. Or get ready for a hasty retreat 
from the onrushing insect hordes.

Louisiana Republicans on Saturday endorsed a New Orleans state senator to 
challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, decisively rejecting a bid 
by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who is now a state representative. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the statewide convention picked state Sen. Ben Bagert over 
Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, state Rep. Quentin Dastugue of Metairie and 
Duke, also of Metairie. 
</P>
<P>
Bagert garnered 451 votes. He was followed by Dastugue with 183, McKeithen with 
99 and Duke with 52. 
</P>
<P>
Bagert, 46, had been considered the front-runner for the party nomination after 
winning commitments from more than 350 of the 540 delegates chosen at party 
caucuses statewide Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates elected at the caucuses, however, had not been required to 
support the candidate they said they would vote for. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 39, won no more than 50 delegates at the caucuses and party officials 
said previously that he had little support among party regulars. He said he 
would oppose Johnston regardless of whether he won the GOP endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, a three-term Democrat, heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee.

ACTRESS VIVECA LINDFORS ATTACKED BY YOUNG SLASHER ON NEW YORK STREET;

Veteran actress Viveca Lindfors, whose stage and screen career spans half a 
century, was slashed across the face and ear early Saturday by a member of a 
gang in New York's Greenwich Village. But, after leaving the hospital with 28 
stitches, she managed to perform at a Saturday matinee, reading poetry with her 
theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
In the same neighborhood, minutes before the assault, the attacker, described 
by Lindfors as a white man about 19 years old, also apparently slashed Dennis 
Beal, 36, across the face and neck. It took 40 stitches to close his wound. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where random violence often appears routine, the crime and the pluck 
of the actress struck a nerve. Members of the audience applauded when she 
appeared to read poetry less than 12 hours after being released from St. 
Vincent's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He must have taken my face in his hands and cut me at the same time," 
Lindfors, 69, said after the performance. " . . . It was pure violence, pure 
violence, and that's disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Lindfors and three friends had just emerged from a condominium in 
Greenwich Village and were talking on the sidewalk when a group of five men and 
two women, by the actress' account, ran past, and the man slashed her. Police 
said the same man apparently cut Beal on the right side of his face from the 
bottom of his ear to his throat. Beal was walking on the street when what is 
believed to be the same gang came up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the incidents occurred within five minutes of each other and 3 
blocks apart. They said robbery apparently was not the motive. 
</P>
<P>
Lindfors said the attacker was a tall white man, and other members of the 
racially mixed gang appeared appalled at what he had done. The attacker said 
nothing to the actress during the slashing, but Lindfors said one of her 
companions later told her that other gang members were saying: "What is he 
doing? What is he doing now?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think the gang was not really with him on doing what he was doing," Lindfors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After returning home at 5:30 a.m. from the hospital, Lindfors surprised family 
members by getting up 4 1/2 hours later and preparing to go to the small 
second-floor studio near Times Square where her theater company had scheduled a 
poetry reading. 
</P>
<P>
The gray-haired actress, who was born in Sweden and came to the United States 
in 1946, read several poems before talking with reporters at the end of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Shaler McClure, an actress in the production, said Lindfors had called her at 
home to announce that the performance was still going on. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first met her for the first performance in June, I was very nervous 
about going on with very little rehearsal," McClure recalled. "Viveca said, 
'You'll do just fine. In this business, 90% is just showing up.' And that's 
what she did today." 
</P>
<P>
Lindfors, who has appeared in dozens of theatrical productions, motion pictures 
and television shows, and who is a founder of the Berkshire Theater Festival, 
said she went on stage "as a way of getting yourself back into normality." 
</P>
<P>
"If you lie there, thinking about your . . . " She began to laugh before the 
sentence was completed. " . . . I don't know any other way to deal with it than 
to try to get my group together to do poetry and try to get yourself above it 
somehow." 
</P>
<P>
She said she hoped the slasher's companions would turn him in. "I am just 
hoping people in the gang will get in touch with their morality and give him up 
so he can get some help. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . This kid must have been very passionate, very turbulent, and if you 
could channel that quality into something creative, he might become a very 
important human being," said the actress, who has appeared in productions 
ranging from Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" to "Brecht on Brecht" to "Pal Joey." 
She paused for just a second. "I think he is now a sad character."

The government announced Saturday that it has appointed a three-member team of 
legal veterans to head the prosecution of the federal drug-trafficking case 
against former Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen told reporters he will not personally prosecute the 
case, which is expected to take 18 months to prepare and at least two months to 
try. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the prosecution will be Asst. U.S. Atty. Michael Sullivan, 42, the 
senior litigation counsel in the Southern District of Florida. He has 18 years' 
experience, Lehtinen said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Sullivan will be First Deputy Myles Malman, 43, the No. 3 prosecutor in 
Lehtinen's office, and Deputy U.S. Solicitor General William Bryson of the 
solicitor's office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega and 15 others are charged in a 12-count drug-trafficking indictment 
returned Feb. 4, 1988, by a federal grand jury in Miami. If convicted, Noriega 
faces a maximum penalty 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
He was indicted the same day by a grand jury in Tampa, Fla., with two others 
for allegedly arranging to smuggle nearly 1 million pounds of marijuana into 
the United States from 1982 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan began working with the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami in 1971 and has 
been there ever since, except for two years when he headed the Miami Organized 
Crime Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Malman has been a federal prosecutor for 15 years and served for more than 10 
years as one of six senior trial lawyers for New York County Dist. Atty. Robert 
Morgenthau. He led the prosecution in the conviction of members of the Cali, 
Colombia, cocaine cartel, a case that resulted in a federal undercover 
money-laundering investigation called Operation Swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
Bryson, who for four years has supervised briefings and arguments in all 
federal criminal cases before the Supreme Court, will advise the prosecution 
team, Lehtinen said. 
</P>
<P>
Lehtinen denied reports that officials in Washington did not want him to handle 
the case personally, saying the decision was his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be the individual who spends two months in court at trial and 
18 months in preparation of the case," he said. "I'm happy I have not been 
ordered to do that. It is not reasonable to expect the U.S. attorney to 
personally try the case."

Pope John Paul II on Saturday appeared to call on Washington to withdraw its 
forces from Panama as soon as possible, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"There, too, it is the civilian population which has suffered the most," the 
Pope said in his yearly address to the diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
"One hopes that without delay the Panamanian people may return to a normal life 
with the dignity and freedom to which any sovereign people have a right." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has said 202 civilians were killed in a U.S. invasion last 
month that ousted strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that by using the words normal and sovereign, the Pope appeared 
to be calling on Washington to withdraw its troops from Panama as soon as 
possible. But they noted that his language was neither harsh nor pointed. 
</P>
<P>
In what is known unofficially as his "state of the world" talk, the Pope also 
told diplomats that the West should help newly democratic Eastern European 
nations develop societies based on moral values, not treat them as new members 
of a club of consumer countries. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff devoted more than half of his 13-page address to the stunning 
changes in Eastern Europe, which he said resulted from the "irrepressible 
thirst for freedom which has . . . toppled walls and opened doors."

ARRAIJAN, Panama 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Navy Lt. Pete Pedrozo squealed his jeep to a dusty halt and strode into what 
serves for a jail these days in this small provincial town. With pistol 
strapped firmly to his side, the judge had come. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind bars had reportedly stabbed his wife in a drunken rage. But the 
acting local magistrate, a schoolteacher, had refused to rule on the case for 
fear that any decision might invite bloody retribution. 
</P>
<P>
And so judgment was left to Pedrozo, whose new judicial circuit covers more 
than 200 square miles on the west bank of the Panama Canal. The Navy lieutenant 
deliberated, and he ruled: Jose Arauz would be bound over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation in which violence and political fragility in the aftermath of the 
American invasion have posed severe tests on those attempting to rebuild the 
judicial system, Pedrozo and others who represent the temporary U.S. solution 
see themselves in the role of Wild West magistrates such as Judge Roy Bean, who 
rode a circuit to enforce the law when no one else would. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frontier justice," said Marine Corps Capt. Barry Cronin, the military 
governor, in effect, of the region in which Pedrozo acts as chief judge. "But 
it's a start." 
</P>
<P>
The circuit-riding scheme is part of a larger U.S. military effort to impose a 
semblance of order on Panama while working gradually to restore full power to 
civilian authorities. For now, while lightly armed Panamanian police join U.S. 
machine-gunners on joint patrols and night courts have begun to take on 
misdemeanor cases, the establishment of a full-scale Panamanian legal system 
seems unlikely to occur very soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a tall order for them," Army Gen. Joseph Kinzer, the incoming 
deputy commander of U.S. Army South, said in an interview. "What occurred in 
the whole operation was that you just neutralized the whole infrastructure. 
There isn't much left to grab hold of." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, crime ran rampant in many parts of Panama in the first days after the 
Dec. 20 invasion. Even after the looting stopped, the American soldiers 
guarding the streets gave top priority to pursuing suspected members of the 
Panama Defense Forces, and for more than a week paid scant attention to the 
slew of reported robberies and other street crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of progress since has varied, with the familiar trappings of justice 
most visible in the capital, whose return to normalcy was given top priority by 
the United States. Members of the newly constituted Panamanian police work 
closely with U.S. military police, while some Panamanian courts have begun to 
hear minor cases on their own. In a further step, chief prosecutor Rogelio Cruz 
said last week that he had issued formal criminal complaints against more than 
50 former associates of ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But in the zone of Arraijan, on the far side of the canal from the metropolis, 
the visage of justice more often bears smears of camouflage paint, and its 
bearing remains unmistakably that of the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
It is Marines, not MPs, who patrol the region, peering coolly from their jeeps 
and trucks through Vuarnet sunglasses. Although they are joined by members of 
the newly renamed Panamanian Public Force, that group's near-universal PDF 
heritage breeds wariness among the populace and relegates its members to a 
secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
And it is Lt. Pedrozo, and not temporary magistrates like Juana de Gonzales, 
who decides at least the immediate fate of suspected criminals like Arauz, the 
accused wife-stabber. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, a middle-aged woman who before the U.S. invasion worked for 29 years 
as an elementary schoolteacher and now is filling in for a Noriega-era judge 
who fled and another who has been jailed, said she simply felt uncomfortable 
deciding a case as grave as a stabbing. But Panamanian and U.S. authorities 
said they believe fear was a factor as well, given the instability of her 
authority in a town that has not yet even settled on a mayor to run the city 
under the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
"Old hatreds are a problem," said Capt. Milton Castillo, who had been 
imprisoned for 21 months at the time of the invasion for his role in a failed 
March, 1988, coup attempt against Noriega and was appointed last week as the 
Panamanian Public Force's commander in the Arraijan region. "There is a lot 
that remains unsettled here." 
</P>
<P>
Echoes of that apprehension raise the very real possibility that Panamanian 
leaders might be the last to accept the complete withdrawal of American troops 
back to the United States and back inside U.S. bases that were here before the 
invasion and will remain, with their primary mission being the defense of the 
Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will want them out sooner than the Panamanians," U.S. Ambassador 
Deane R. Hinton told reporters Saturday. "I hear more people saying keep the 
troops than get them out." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem that limits Panamanian autonomy is reflected in a situation in 
this region west of the canal: The regional jail adjoining Castillo's 
headquarters in La Chorrera, the area's largest town, was destroyed in the U.S. 
attack. Left with the prospect of housing prisoners in makeshift facilities, 
such as a small shed that serves as a holding tank in Arraijan, U.S. 
authorities have opted to dispatch them to a central detention area on Empire 
Range, a U.S. military area outside Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
That facility is the same one that processed about 4,300 suspected former PDF 
members in the aftermath of the invasion, permitting nearly all of them to 
return to active duty. About 400 of the prisoners of war remain behind bars, 
100 of them in secure cells at Ft. Clayton, a U.S. Army base near Panama City. 
Only a few of the latter have been permitted to see visitors, an Army lawyer 
said last week. They face continued interrogation by military intelligence 
experts before being turned over to Panamanian prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the common criminals also will face Panamanian justice; there are 
no plans for U.S. military magistrates to conduct proceedings more extensive 
than pretrial hearings. But both U.S. and Panamanian authorities concede that 
it could be months before that process is fully under way. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, U.S. military commanders are prepared for a time to continue 
acting as police and prosecutor and judge. "Right now, it's just holding down 
the fort," said Capt. David de Silva, a Green Beret assigned to oversee the 
transition in La Chorrera. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lt. Pedrozo -- who owes his incarnation as circuit judge in the 
tropics to his Ohio State law degree and the fact that he is the only Navy 
lawyer in Panama -- says he is eager to see the Panamanian magistrates take his 
job away from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed it," he said. "But I'm ready to get out of this business just as 
soon as they're ready to do the job."

crashed three days ago in the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a helicopter discovered the wreckage of the Cessna aircraft 
and confirmed that all aboard had perished when the plane crashed at about 
10,000 feet on a mountain near the city of Copiapo in northern Chile.

12 CONTRACT LUNG DISEASE AFTER WORKING WITH BERYLLIUM

Twelve people who were exposed to the metal beryllium while working at the 
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant have contracted a deadly lung disease, an 
Energy Department study obtained by a newspaper says. 
</P>
<P>
Eight current Rocky Flats workers and four retired employees tested positive 
for berylliosis, the Denver Post reported in Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
They were among more than 750 employees at the federal complex 16 miles 
northwest of Denver who have handled beryllium, a metal used in the manufacture 
of plutonium triggers. So far, diagnostic tests have been given to 391 of those 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
No deaths have been reported, but the incurable disease usually proves fatal to 
30% of those who contract it, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The disease was discovered during a study of Rocky Flats financed by the Energy 
Department and the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say it is the biggest work force study of berylliosis to date and 
is scheduled to be completed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 American workers have been exposed to beryllium dust in 
93,000 private and government plants across the nation. At Rocky Flats, the 
Energy Department has spent $2 million in the past four years on a program to 
improve safety conditions.

EX-FED CHIEF TO FILL U.S. CAMPEAU JOB, PAPER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
G. William Miller, who has been Treasury secretary and chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Board, has tentatively agreed to take the helm of the U.S. retailing 
operations of troubled Campeau Corp., a Canadian newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Miller, currently a member of Toronto-based Campeau's board of 
directors, nor other Campeau officials could be reached for comment on the 
report by the Financial Post of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
As reported Saturday, a source familiar with Campeau's plans said the company 
was expecting to name, possibly as soon as today, a prominent figure with a 
background in business, law and politics to become the new U.S. chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who holds a law degree from UC Berkeley, was chairman of the Federal 
Reserve in 1978-79 and Treasury secretary from 1979-81 in the Jimmy Carter 
Administration. Before entering government, he was chief executive of the 
Providence, R.I.-based conglomerate Textron Inc. 
</P>
<P>
He currently runs a Washington consulting firm bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau last week announced plans to establish an independent U.S. 
organization, headed by a new chairman, to operate its retailing divisions. 
Those divisions include the Compton-based Ralphs supermarkets chain, along with 
Campeau's debt-burdened Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The autonomy plan was intended largely as a prelude to seeking bankruptcy court 
protection for the Federated and Allied units, the source close to Campeau 
said. Although they have no outlets in Southern California, Federated and 
Allied make up the second-largest department store organization in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Financial Post, the Federated and Allied bankruptcy protection 
filings would probably be made in Cincinnati, where the department store 
operations are based. The anticipated filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal 
Bankruptcy Code would give the department stores time to stay in business and 
reorganize while protected from interference by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The department stores' problems stem from huge takeover debts related to 
Campeau's acquisition of Allied for $3.5 billion in 1986 and its purchase of 
Federated for $6.6 billion in 1988. Campeau's department stores include 
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche.

FIRE FATAL TO AMPUTEE CALLED ARSON; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HANDICAPPED WOMAN WAS TRAPPED IN HER BEDROOM. OFFICERS SAY THE BLAZE MAY 
HAVE BEEN RETALIATION FOR DRUG DEAL GONE BAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A handicapped Monrovia woman was trapped in her bedroom early Saturday and died 
in a fire that authorities believe was started by an arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they had no suspects, and there were conflicting reports over 
the possibility that the house at 524 E. Cherry Ave. may have been set afire 
over a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Hicks, 73, whose legs had been amputated at the knees, apparently 
died of smoke inhalation, according to authorities. Relatives and neighbors 
described Hicks as a popular woman whose amputations for medical problems had 
left her mostly bedridden. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's 15-year-old grandson, Carl Reynolds -- who relatives said had 
fallen asleep watching television in his grandmother's bedroom -- escaped after 
the elderly woman awakened him when the fire started about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The youth roused his grandfather, Arthur Hicks, 76, who was asleep in a camper 
parked in the driveway, according to the relatives. Hicks and his grandson 
tried to rescue the handicapped woman but could not get in, said Bruce 
Reynolds, who identified himself as the teen-ager's father. Arthur Hicks cut 
his hand breaking out a window in an attempt to re-enter the house, but was not 
taken to a hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia police officers, arriving just before the Monrovia Fire Department, 
crawled into the burning house to try to save the woman. But they could not 
find her in the smoke and had to abandon the search as the flames spread 
throughout the house, said Monrovia Police Detective Roger Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's wheelchair was found not far from her body. One investigator said 
it appeared that Hicks was attempting to make a telephone call when she was 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said investigators believe the fire was deliberately set, but he did 
not say how, or where. The motive may be revenge, Sheriff's Deputy Bill 
Linnemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators say the home has been used on prior occasions to conduct illegal 
drug sales," Linnemeyer said. "They feel the fire, which is of suspicious 
origin, might be in retaliation for a prior narcotics transaction." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said later that the investigation was not necessarily leading in 
that direction. He refused to say what progress was being made, however. 
</P>
<P>
Houses in the neighborhood are small, stucco-covered buildings, some with bars 
over the windows. The Hicks family had lived in the neighborhood for as long as 
20 years, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said there is a lot of crack 
cocaine sold in the neighborhood. But the neighbor said she did not believe any 
was being sold at the Hicks house. "She was a very nice lady," the neighbor 
said. "It really hurt the neighborhood to see her go like that." 
</P>
<P>
The house was a total loss and damage was estimated at $100,000, according to 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is assisting in the 
investigation.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: ROOTING A GOOD MOVIE TO THE FINISH; 
</P>
<P>
ALL DIRECTORS WALK A TIGHTROPE; HERE ARE TWO WHO MADE IT ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND 
ONE WHO FELL SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I don't know if it happens with occasional movie-goers, but among inveterate 
ones, used to seeing more than a few pictures crash and burn before our eyes, a 
wild hope begins to build up when a movie has gone a quarter, then a third of 
the way through without a misstep. It becomes agonizing. Will they make it? Can 
the director keep this balance to the very end of the tightrope? 
</P>
<P>
It's not idle speculation. Bad movies are very frequently bad in the first two 
minutes, bad under the credits, bad from their first crashing chords. Dramatic 
pauses are held into stagnation. "Interesting" camera turn artsy, then 
oppressive. Everything you needed to know, for example, about what was going to 
go wrong with "Tango and Cash," was laid out in its wonderfully preposterous 
opening sequence. Were you not reviewing, you could grab your hat and make it 
home for the last minutes of a "Buffalo Bill" rerun. 
</P>
<P>
Good movies, on the other hand, sometimes sneak up on you. Suddenly you 
discover you haven't taken a (crucial) note in minutes; you've been sitting 
there, holding your breath, sending useless subliminal messages to all 
concerned not to change a hair, because everything's so perfectly fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas crop has had a batch of those breath-holders. One of the biggest 
was "Driving Miss Daisy," which, even with its magnificent cast, still had the 
chance of turning cloying. It might have been the same small but crucial 
difference -- begging the pardon of all that movie's fans -- between the filmed 
"Trip to Bountiful" and the 1953 television version of that moving Horton Foote 
drama. The film had Geraldine Page's ripe-unto-juicy performance of the runaway 
mother; the tiny television screen glowed with the impeccable rectitude of Miss 
Lillian Gish in the same role. 
</P>
<P>
Another play into film, "Driving Miss Daisy" seems to be an extraordinarily 
intelligent expansion from its play form to the screen. And, fine as some of 
the actresses have been who played the role early on, there was such rightness 
in turning Miss Daisy over to Jessica Tandy and letting it cap her career. 
'Miss Daisy" simply glows with her unmannered simplicity and the growing power 
of Tandy and Morgan Freeman, who, as usual, could not be improved upon as Hoke, 
who comes to drive for Miss Daisy, fully against her will, and stays on for the 
next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Director Bruce Beresford's choices in moving outside Miss Daisy's sturdy, fusty 
house were just right. He gave us a sense of the South at that period, and of 
two distinct and separate worlds within that Southern community. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ackroyd's Boolie, Daisy Werthan's son, appeared and got better with each 
scene. That grand, lusty actress Patty LuPone, as his wife, was hilarious, 
rising determinedly over the years until she achieves her fullest potential as 
the flower of Southern Republican womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
As each segment passed, I was aware of the mounting worry; would it turn soft 
now? There was every chance, as Miss Daisy attended the funeral in a black 
church. Mentally you could tick off the directors who would blow this scene; 
who couldn't resist having Miss Daisy rock ever so slightly with the choir, or 
weep, ever so genteelly, into her handkerchief. But she sat, as isolated as 
ever even in the middle of a crowd, and the scene moved as gloriously as the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
I think the tension passed when, even as segregation begins to crumble around 
them, and the Jewish, liberal Daisy Werthan has gone to hear a speech by Martin 
Luther King, there's a scene where Miss Daisy takes her dinner. By herself in 
her dining room, exactly as she always has. 
</P>
<P>
Everything from that point on was pure relaxation. This company of artists 
weren't going to slop over, to go for the easy emotion . . . And, of course, 
right up and through that last, utterly destroying scene, they never do. 
</P>
<P>
All the way down "The War of the Roses" bitter road from matrimony to 
divorce-talk to mayhem there are places for that movie to go careening off, as 
well. There in the theater, exchanging knowledgeable glances with a friend 
about the unsuspected fury that divorce can unleash, those places worried me. 
Would director Danny DeVito give way; would his pure and utterly unsentimental 
intent crack? 
</P>
<P>
One trap was an athletic "love" scene in the attic, which from husband Michael 
Douglas' point of view looks as though passion -- or at least marital habit -- 
was going to carry the day. The other was the now-infamous pate scene, in which 
a suspiciously amiable Kathleen Turner serves her husband one of his favorite 
kind of her specialties. 
</P>
<P>
Well, DeVito weakened a trifle in the matter of the pate. He added a quick shot 
to reassure doggy lovers everywhere -- although he did nothing to mollify the 
cat people in an earlier scene, come to think of it. 
</P>
<P>
However, by and large, DeVito was able to keep his buzz-saw edge. Then came the 
film's final battle, one last opportunity for the movie's nastiness to be 
blunted with one generous gesture, and my heart was pounding. Would DeVito, in 
a kinder, gentler mood, compromise all that had gone before? Nope, DeVito held 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
All I could think, in wonder, was how many meetings did that scene kick up? How 
in heaven's name did everyone, director DeVito, producer James Brooks, do it? 
And what a wonder that they did. 
</P>
<P>
Because actually, "Roses" is not anti-marriage. As shown by the action of the 
mute listener to DeVito's Grand Guignol cautionary tale, it's not pro-divorce, 
either. It's against an empty edifice of a marriage that is like a meringue 
shell with nothing nourishing to it and only hollowness inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the 4th of July" is guerrilla warfare of another kind. The picture 
wears Oliver Stone's heart so nakedly on its sleeve that watching it, I was at 
the same time drawn into it and wary that he would do his old trick of 
underlining everything for us, again. 
</P>
<P>
The first warning came in the prologue: little boys playing desperate games of 
war; Ron Kovic's mother calling him her little Yankee Doodle Dandy, and as they 
watched the JFK inaugural speech together, telling her young son her dream that 
it, too, was making a speech and all the people were listening. Impossible not 
to think, oh oh. 
</P>
<P>
Then the superb middle section happens; brilliant writing and editing choices 
that take us from a nightmarish field hospital to a urine-drenched Veteran's 
hospital corridor where the wheelchaired Kovic is marooned. Compression. Angry 
compassion. And finally, a moment of quiet rare in any Stone picture but as 
welcome here as a pitcherful of cool spring water. 
</P>
<P>
Every second, every glance in that nighttime backyard scene between two severly 
wounded young soldiers, actors Tom Cruise and Frank Waley, was so precise, so 
fine that I began to relax into hope that this film was from the mature, 
assured Oliver Stone, who finally put some trust in us, his audience. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't to be. Certainly Stone's recreation of '70s marches and 
demonstrations are enough to bring that time back, even if your own 
participation was from in front of a television screen. But as the scene 
swirled with action, there was still time enough to wonder exactly how Kovic's 
change of political heart had come about, and to realize that that-important 
point had somehow been mislaid among the hyperbole of the action. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, having been belted around by Stone's frantic action and John Williams' 
epic-sized score, almost a war all its own, Kovic was going out on the stage of 
the Democratic Convention to address that enormous crowd. The fear flooded 
back: was Stone, for once, going to have a little faith in us, the benighted 
members of his audience? Well, he did and he didn't. It was a brilliant idea to 
let Kovic's speech go unheard; we had, after all, been all through it -- 
nothing he could say could be any more eloquent than that. But it was a 
terrible move to replay, in flashback, his mother's scene from his childhood 
that someday he'd make a speech too, and everyone would listen. A lot more 
people, I found myself thinking, might be willing to listen, if director Stone 
would only take his foot off their chests.

THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paula Abdul, Milli Vanilli, Skid Row, Neneh Cherry, De La Soul, Clint Black, 
Texas and Soul II Soul had the kind of debuts in 1989 that fledgling 
record-makers dream about. 
</P>
<P>
But, what about a quarter of a century from now? How will their impact on pop 
music be measured in 2015? 
</P>
<P>
That's the year when any act that made its formal recording debut during the 
last 12 months becomes eligible for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It's humbling for the newcomers to imagine themselves eventually being measured 
against the long-term commercial and/or critical success of several of the 
artists who'll be inducted during the fifth annual Hall of Fame ceremonies 
Wednesday night in New York -- a lineup that includes the Who, Simon &amp; 
Garfunkel, the Kinks, the Four Tops and Bobby Darin. (See Don Waller's look at 
the 1990 Hall of Fame class on opposite page). 
</P>
<P>
The contributions of the eight artists being inducted this week aren't equal, 
but even the weakest entries in this year's class helped define pop genres and 
accumulated a massive string of hits. 
</P>
<P>
This year's induction class brings to 43 the number of artists or groups 
honored by the Hall of Fame -- and the selections offer a guide to the 
standards set by the approximate 300 Hall of Fame voters (mostly recording 
executives, musicians and critics) who determine who will be saluted. 
</P>
<P>
The discouraging thing about this year's crop is a slight decline in past 
standards. Where the voters continue in most cases to favor artistic merit over 
simply commercial credentials, the election this year of the Four Seasons and 
the Platters -- ahead of the far more influential Bob Marley or Curtis Mayfield 
or Yardbirds -- suggests a tendency to be swayed by the sheer number of hits. 
</P>
<P>
For all his impact, both in and out of the reggae movement, Marley, for 
instance, never had a Top 40 single in the U.S., though two of his albums made 
the Top 20. By contrast, the Platters, the smoothly designed, but narrow Los 
Angeles R&amp;B vocal group, registered 20 Top 40 hits between 1955 and 1961. 
The Four Seasons, the vibrant, but also limited East Coast vocal outfit, 
generated 26 Top 40 hits between 1962 and 1968. 
</P>
<P>
This slight shift toward the commercial rather than the significant suggests a 
boost to the future Hall of Fame chances of contemporary artists -- such as 
Billy Joel and Phil Collins -- who do little to stretch pop's artistic 
boundaries, but are gifted enough craftsmen to be consistent hitmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In putting together this year's annual report on the chances of today's 
artists' eventually being inducted into the Hall of Fame, the emphasis is kept 
on significance rather than sales, in the hope that this year's slight break 
from that tradition was not the start of a trend. The chances are presented on 
a scale of 0% (hopeless) to 99.99% (congratulations) -- along with an 
indication, where appropriate, on whether the status improved or diminished 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Artists are listed in alphabetical order with new entries following the main 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The Bangles -- When the Go-Go's broke up after just three albums, the Los 
Angeles band left the door open for another group to challenge for the spot 
reserved in the Rock Hall of Fame to salute the first great all-woman group. 
The Bangles looked like they had a chance, but they too have called it quits 
before putting a lock on the claim. 5%. Down 5% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bon Jovi -- Nothing here on an artistic level, but the last album sold 5 
million copies and sharp management is positioning them well. Note the 
headlining shows in Moscow. 12%. Up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Chapman -- Because the race for the Hall of Fame certification is so 
long, even someone who makes as celebrated an arrival as this protest-minded 
singer did last year can only be given a 10% chance of eventual success. 
Strangely, Chapman's second album, "Crossroads," did little to clarify her 
standing. Her craft seemed intact, but her vision didn't expand. 10%. No 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis Costello -- When a strong marketing push by Warner Bros., Costello's new 
label, and almost universally glowing reviews failed to push "Spike" into the 
Top 20, it's clear that Costello is never going to be able to depend on sales 
to earn his way into the Hall of Fame. Fortunately, he doesn't need to. His 
artistry should be enough. 95%. Up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Terence Trent D'Arby -- Like Chapman, D'Arby was awarded a maximum 10% for his 
flashy 1988 debut. Even though his second album, "Neither Fish Nor Flesh," has 
bombed (so far), he exhibited enough artistry and ambition to earn a slight 
upgrade. 13%. Up 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Eurythmics -- Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox were once the essence of style in 
pop-rock, as reflected by their 40% rating in the 1988 edition of the Hall of 
Fame report. But the English duo seems to have run out of ideas, leaving it on 
a l-o-n-g downhill spiral. 10%. Down 15% for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Guns N' Roses -- Even without a new album in '89, this hard-rock band's 
standing increased dramatically, thanks in part to continued heavy rotation on 
MTV. Sharing the stage with the Stones also helped spread the word that this 
band isn't just another in the disheartening tradition of hollow, recycled '80s 
hard-rock acts. If the new album, due this fall, matches the best moments on 
"Appetite for Destruction," the band's standing next year could take an even 
bigger jump. 30%. Up 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel -- Not a personal favorite, but the hits continue to come and 
there's every bit as much creative vision as the Four Seasons. So, it looks 
like he's going to make it. 77%. Up 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Jackson -- Good year and now she's getting ready to tour. Question of 
depth, however. 12%. Up 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna -- She has so much star power and cultural impact that she moved up 5 
percentage points in 1988 without even releasing an album. Thanks to good sales 
and generally good reviews for "Like a Prayer," she moves up dramatically this 
time. 99%. Up 14%. 
</P>
<P>
John Mellencamp -- The absence of a tour this year made it a quiet year, but 
the best moments of the "Big Daddy" album demonstrated continued growth as an 
artist. 70%. Up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
George Michael -- Even more important than the 7 million-plus sales of "Faith" 
was the way that this former teen idol continued in 1989 to gain industry 
respect. There's already a buzz about his new album, due this summer. 35%. Up 
5%. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers -- Even though Petty showed with "Full Moon 
Fever" that he can operate quite nicely without the Heartbreakers, he made his 
reputation with the band and he will be on the Hall of Fame ballot with the 
band rather than a solo artist. Still, "Full Moon Fever," coming on the heels 
of the Traveling Wilburys success, gave him another boost. 92%. Up 10%. 
</P>
<P>
R.E.M. -- The leaders of the '80s' college/alternative rock may have lost some 
urgency in moving into the mainstream, but there's still enough of a history 
and time left to make them serious contenders. 70%. Up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Run-DMC -- They've become suddenly passe, but their standing as the first 
superstars of rap may still be enough. 40%. Down 5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Change 
</P>
<P>
These artists, either through inactivity in 1989 or no dramatic moves, rate the 
same scores as given them last year: Anita Baker (12%), Peter Gabriel (90%), 
Whitney Houston (20%), Michael Jackson (99%), Pet Shop Boys (12%), Prince 
(99%), Duran Duran (5%), Replacements (35%), Bruce Springsteen (99%), U2 (95%). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New to the Competition 
</P>
<P>
Paula Abdul -- She's ideal for the video generation, but is there enough 
beneath the flash? 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Aerosmith -- Since returning to action in the '80s, this veteran hard-rock 
band's chances have improved markedly. There's more consistency on stage and 
greater range on record. 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Black -- Lots of support in country circles, but country artists haven't 
done well with Hall of Fame voters. Even Johnny Cash -- someone with a rock 
connection -- has been passed over by Hall of Fame voters. 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown -- He's got great moves on stage and his records carry a sizzling 
contemporary heat, but his singing is limited and his vision is suspect. 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry -- She has a chance. She seems intelligent, has ambition and 
style. One key will be how good she is live. 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins -- A remarkable eight No. 1 singles during the '80s and a trickle 
of critical respect has to be taken seriously in light of the Four Seasons' and 
Platters' victories, but not that seriously. You see how his stock falls when 
you place his body of work alongside, say, Lou Reed or Neil Young. 20%. 
</P>
<P>
De La Soul -- Gifted new rap group, but the burn-off factor in rap is real 
h-i-g-h. 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals -- The English trio was a disappointment live, but the 
album was one of the year's most acclaimed. 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour -- A breakthrough for black musicians in rock and an excellent 
leader, on stage and off, in Vernon Reid. 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marx -- Lots of sales, but little imagination. 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli -- Even more sales and less imagination. 1%. 
</P>
<P>
New Kids on the Block -- Amazing success story so far, but can the Boston group 
move beyond its teen-idol base? Some people feel there is enough in the group's 
first two albums to suggest the group can break through, but it's going to be 
tough. 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy -- The politically-minded New York rappers started off 1989 by 
winning the Village Voice critics' poll for album of the year, but ended it 
amid troubling questions of anti-Semitism. Can the group answer the questions 
satisfactorily and then regain its artistic momentum? It won't be easy. If they 
can, double their Hall of Fame chances. If they can't, so long. 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Ronstadt -- Returning to the Top 10 with an Aaron Neville duet, Ronstadt 
may surprise us in the long run. She's always had a great voice, but there was 
always a question about how strong a vision she had, but her instincts seem 
increasingly daring. 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row -- Sebastian Bach seems to be a legitimate hard-rock hero, but the 
music needs more personality and punch. 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul -- "Keep on Movin' " was a sensational start and Jazzie B 
certainly has the determination, but it is a group project and it's not clear 
just where the real creative energy lies. 9%. 
</P>
<P>
Texas -- An exciting young band from Scotland that was especially appealing 
live, blending lonesome guitar strains and sharp, bluesy songs. 6%. 
</P>

THIS YEAR'S HALL OF FAMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANK BALLARD &amp; THE MIDNIGHTERS 
</P>
<P>
The truly seminal rock trilogy ("Work With Me Annie," "Annie Had a Baby," "Sexy 
Ways") -- laughably deracinated into "Dance With the Henry" for the pop market 
so that kids in the '50s would grow up to be Dan and Marilyn Quayle -- is 
almost tuff enuff to merit Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters' induction by its 
lonesome. The Midnighters themselves, recording (minus Ballard) as the Royals, 
first hit in '51 with "Every Beat of My Heart" -- the same tune that launched 
Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips' career a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
'Bout that time, the Detroit homeboys cut three more 
wear-the-shine-off-the-dance-floor perennials: "Finger Poppin' Time," "Let's 
Go, Let's Go, Let's Go" and the original version of "The Twist." (Ballard has 
said he took "The Twist" from the Clyde McPhatter-era Drifters' "What'cha Gonna 
Do," which is credited to Atlantic Records honcho Ahmet Ertegun, which means 
the jam was probably at least as old as homemade sin.) 
</P>
<P>
Ballard later fell into James Brown's camp and, in a case of the master 
imitating the pupil, made a series of soul/funk discs, including the deathless 
"How You Gonna Get Respect (If You Ain't Cut Your Process Yet)," that are now 
more highly regarded than ever on the international/collector's markets. 
</P>
<P>
BOBBY DARIN 
</P>
<P>
Some folks like to rationalize Darin's inclusion on the ground that rock 'n' 
roll owes a lot more to pre-rock pop, as personified by the man born Robert 
Walden Cassotto, than it likes to admit. Bit of a stretch, eh? 
</P>
<P>
Inarguably more talented than his original teen-idol image suggested, Darin did 
bring such left-field writers as Bertolt Brecht &amp; Kurt Weill and Tim Hardin 
into the mainstream via his performances of "Mack the Knife" and "If I Were a 
Carpenter," respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The brash New Yorker also wrote songs for Buddy Holly, became an Academy 
Award-nominated actor ("Captain Newman, MD"), a semi-successful folk singer 
(the "Bob Darin" period) and, finally, a Vegas headliner before dying in 1973, 
following a history of heart problems. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
THE FOUR SEASONS 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Frankie Valli had a glass-shattering falsetto that combined with 
the shimmering pop production of Bob Crewe -- who co-wrote the hits ("Sherry," 
"Big Girls Don't Cry," "Walk Like a Man") with group member Bob Gaudio -- to 
create the penultimate white doo-wop group (previous inductees Dion &amp; the 
Belmonts being the last word on the subject.) 
</P>
<P>
Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi completed the hit machine, which not only wound up 
doing Dylan songs under the name the Wonder Who, but also hung in long enough 
to capitalize on the nostalgia craze (1975's "December 1963") before Valli 
stepped out on a solo career for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Seasons didn't originate the stratospheric vocal style, but as unofficial 
spokesmen for their East Coast ethnic working-class audience, they were its 
most successful exponents. For further evidence, look no further than "The Deer 
Hunter" sequence where the guys get all maudlin singing along with "My Eyes 
Adored You" on the jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
THE FOUR TOPS 
</P>
<P>
The sixth Motown act inducted, the Four Tops are perhaps most remarkable for 
two things: the steel-belted vocal cords of Levi Stubbs and having never once 
changed personnel in 36 years -- all the more amazing, considering there's no 
family ties that bind 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs, Renaldo (Obie) Benson, Abdul (Duke) Fakir and Lawrence Payton hung in 
hitless for years until they signed with Motown. There, working with 
writers/producers Holland-Dozier-Holland, they cut umpteen certifiable classics 
("Reach Out, I'll Be There," "Baby I Need Your Loving") and two equally 
brilliant non-HDH tunes ("Ask the Lonely" and "Loving You Is Sweeter Than 
Ever"), splitting shortly after the producers upped 'n' quit the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Although not the most versatile vocal group, these Detroiters didn't exactly 
lack talent -- unlike most acts that exited Motown, they've had hits (1973's 
"Ain't No Woman Like the One I've Got" and 1981's "When She Was My Girl") 
since, and currently record for Arista Records. 
</P>
<P>
THE KINKS 
</P>
<P>
Led by England's poet laureate of the mundane and the working class (same 
thing), singer/songwriter/guitarist Ray Davies, the Kinks have long been the 
wittiest ("Waterloo Sunset"), most sensitive ("Dead End Street"), most 
unconventional ("Village Green Preservation Society"), most raucous of rollers. 
</P>
<P>
The proto-metallic riff slinging began with 1964's "You Really Got Me," but the 
original lineup of Ray and lead guitarist/little brother Dave Davies, bassist 
Pete Quaife and drummer Mick Avory swiftly set out on a roller-coastercareer 
course that spawned intermittent hits ("Lola," "Celluloid Heroes," "Come 
Dancing"), arguably the first "rock opera" (1969's "Arthur" LP), and continues 
as a battling brother act to this day. 
</P>
<P>
Face to face, the Kinks are a book -- they've been several -- but as one of the 
rare rock-era songwriters who doesn't traffic almost exclusively in 
first-person, confessional material, Davies will probably have to die and get a 
Broadway play produced around his life 'n' work to get his true aesthetic dues. 
Until then, he'll have to settle for being enshrined in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLATTERS 
</P>
<P>
This L.A.-based quintet is chiefly notable for being rock's first big R&amp;B 
crossover act, moving into the supper club circuit on the strength of such 
mellow-dramatic ballads as "Twilight Time," "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" and "My 
Prayer" and the titanic tenor vocals of Tony Williams, which disguised that the 
rest of the group (Zola Taylor, Herb Reed, David Lynch, Paul Robi) was pretty 
much window dressing. Manager/producer/songwriter Buck Ram probably deserves 
much of the credit for the success, but then he probably got most of the money 
already. 
</P>
<P>
After the hits tapered off, Williams went solo and the resulting 
personnel/personal problems relegated the group to a lounge act status that was 
interrupted only by a lesser string of sweet soul/"beach music" favorites 
("With This Ring" being the best) in the mid-'60s. Since then it's all been low 
comedy, with the endless proliferation of acts working under the Platters' name 
giving rise to a grand, if ignoble rock 'n' roll tradition in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
SIMON &amp; GARFUNKEL 
</P>
<P>
Back in '58 when these New Yorkers were known as Tom &amp; Jerry, they rocked 
out in a sort of sub-Everly Brothers manner on "Hey Little School Girl." After 
solo efforts as Jerry Landis and Artie Garr didn't make it, they reunited as a 
serious folk duo. 
</P>
<P>
Unsung hero/record producer Tom Wilson (the Animals, the Velvet Underground) 
added a folk-rock backing to an album track called "The Sounds of Silence," 
scored a smash and for five years the ultra-senstitive, overly wrought hits 
("Hazy Shade of Winter," "Mrs. Robinson,") just kept on comin'. 
</P>
<P>
The breakup came in 1970, shortly after their biggest hit ("Bridge Over 
Troubled Water"), though there have been two reunions since. Meanwhile, Simon's 
musical journey has mirrored that of his collegiate audience, recently winding 
up on the streets outside of "Graceland," where he introduced Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo to an unsuspecting world. In cold print, the relationship between these 
ersatz folkies and rock 'n' roll has never been more dubious. 
</P>
<P>
THE WHO 
</P>
<P>
With Pete Townshend's windmill guitar figures, Roger Daltrey's mike-tossing 
routines, John Entwistle's free bass-lines and a drummer (the late Keith Moon) 
who redefined traditional notions of rock timekeeping, the Who introduced a 
hyper-kinetic, smash 'em up stage act that was rivaled only by James Brown's 
R&amp;B passion plays. Toss in a bleeding handful of brilliant, 
alone-in-a-crowd Townshend compositions ("My Generation," "The Kids Are 
Alright," "I Can See for Miles") and you'll begin to understand just how far 
ahead of their contemporaries these London mods really were. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they made it really big Stateside, they'd toned it down 
considerably. Townshend had written the rock opera "Tommy" and -- with the 
exception of the rock-solid "Who's Next" LP -- the weight of the themes essayed 
too often capsized the material's once-powerful pop elements. 
</P>
<P>
The Who soldiered on, made a lot of money, documented everything on film, and 
were last sighted on the road, playing "Tommy" and all ye olde favorites as if 
punk -- which their early records were a major influence upon -- never 
happened.

POP EYE: THE CRITICAL LIST: ROCK BOTTOM IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grammy Awards nominations are the talk of the town this week. But the real 
hot topic at industry cocktail parties isn't always the year's most acclaimed 
albums. Sometimes, the hubbub is over the least acclaimed records. In fact, 
many execs have been ribbing each other in recent days about the albums that -- 
artistically at least -- everyone would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
That means it's time for Pop Eye's 10th annual Bottom 10 Poll, a collection of 
1989's biggest critical flops. We've polled 40 writers, deejays, record execs, 
managers, musicians and rank 'n' file music fans for their picks for this 
coveted Dean's List of Decrepit Discs. 
</P>
<P>
The year's biggest stink bomb? By a close margin, the winner was Stevie Nicks' 
much-maligned "The Other Side of the Mirror," which one voter described as 
having the sound quality of "a yak singing in a wind tunnel." It's Nicks' first 
appearance in the Bottom 10, though her last solo album made honorable mention 
in the 1985 voting. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a big year for belly-flops by hard-rock bands (Kingdom Come and 
Whitesnake ranked No. 2 and No. 3), comeback attempts (David Crosby finished 
No. 8) and comics (Andrew Dice Clay had a strong No. 6 showing, nearly equaling 
Sam Kinison's No. 5 effort last year). 
</P>
<P>
One voter, who picked Kingdom Come's album, sagely noted: "The record was so 
bad that the group was so embarrassed that they broke up after listening to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bottom 10 voters also showed considerable brand-name loyalty. Three different 
artists -- Cher, Belinda Carlisle and Billy Joel -- were all repeats were from 
1987's Bottom 10 poll. Diana Ross, who ranked No. 5 this time, topped her 1985 
No. 9 showing. Milli Vanilli, placing No. 4, earned the highest spot for a 
first-time pop act since Samantha Fox's debut finished No. 3 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, our voters were eager to suggest new wrinkles. One voter wanted a 
special All-W Bottom 10 (which would include Whitesnake, Winger, Warrant and 
White Lion). Another voter suggested a special category for superfluous '60s 
group reunions, headed by Poco, the Jefferson Airplane and the Doobie Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
One voter even narrowed his Bottom 10 choices to groups who had recorded 
Desmond Child songs (Cher, Alice Cooper and Kiss). Another voted for Warrant 
"simply because of the way they shake their hair in unison in their video." 
</P>
<P>
Narrowly missing the final cut, but getting enough votes to merit honorable 
mention were albums by Phil Collins, Richard Marx, Michael Damien, Taylor Dane, 
Warrant, Britny Fox, the Jacksons, the Jefferson Airplane, Starship and Kenny 
G.

HEAT TREATMENT: With the record industry just back from its annual holiday 
hibernation, the rumor mill has been running overtime, spurred by a rousing 
round of executive musical chairs and reports of label launches all over town. 
Here's a summary: 
</P>
<P>
ISLAND RECORDS: This small label, now owned by PolyGram but still run by 
founder Chris Blackwell, has a new president, Mike Bone. He replaces Lou 
Maglia, who abruptly left the label last month. The 11th-hour deal with Bone 
startled the industry -- especially new Hollywood Records chief, Peter Paterno, 
Bone's ex-lawyer, who'd been telling everyone in town that Bone had signed on 
at Hollywood (Bone had even attended a pair of meetings at the label). 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't Bone take the Hollywood Records job? Industry insiders say money 
played a major role, since Island's offer was far more -- easily six-figures 
more -- than what Bone was offered at Hollywood. And Island could grant Bone 
the title of president, something Paterno couldn't deliver. "The money 
definitely played a big part in my decision -- Chris said 'yes' to everything I 
asked for," Bone said. "With Island, I not only could have the position of 
president, but the opportunity to be at an existing, successful record company. 
And I don't have to move to California -- I can walk to work!" 
</P>
<P>
And why did Bone go to work for Blackwell, a notoriously difficult boss? "I 
figure if I could work for (Arista chief) Clive Davis and (Elektra chief) Bob 
Krasnow, who are very tough but creative guys, I could work for Chris 
Blackwell. He's been a success for 25 years, but sounds like a pretty great 
track record to me." 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD RECORDS: Despite the embarrassment of losing Bone, Paterno still has 
made one key executive acquisition -- luring Wes Hein away from Enigma Records 
-- and is now looking for an A&amp;R chief (having already hired A&amp;R 
staffer Rachel Matthews away from Capitol). Paterno says he's targeting the 
label's first releases for August and hopes to announce a distribution deal 
sometime in February (industry observers give CBS the inside track). He says 
there are no hard feelings about Bone's last-minute reversal. "I was 
disappointed, but obviously Mike got a significantly better offer," Paterno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
POLYGRAM: Industry observers agree that this label, which is still searching 
for a new president, is in disarray. The good news is that PolyGram's 
French-based chief, Alain Levy, has done a brilliant job overseas -- one rival 
exec said PolyGram may have made more money in France last year than it did in 
America, an unprecedented achievement. The bad news: "In the U. S. it's really 
a mess -- it's the quietest company in the world," said one top manager. "They 
need help and right away." Things are so quiet that none of PolyGram's top 
execs would return phone calls. But insiders say Levy has been in New York much 
of the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
CHRYSALIS: After losing Bone, Chris Wright wasted no time in hiring John Sykes, 
an industry vet who was a key figure in the early development of MTV, briefly 
an agent at CAA and, most recently, head of Champion Entertainment, a 
management firm that handles John Cougar Mellencamp, Hall &amp; Oates, Carly 
Simon and Taylor Dane. "Things were going great at Champion, but an opportunity 
like this doesn't come around very often and I couldn't turn it down," said 
Sykes, who began his career in promotion at Epic Records. "Chrysalis has some 
wonderful artists, both here and in England." 
</P>
<P>
But can a small company like Chrysalis still compete with giants like CBS and 
Warners? "I think we're poised to take off in the '90s," he said. "We have the 
distribution clout to sell records, but a small, manageable roster so we can 
offer every artist special care and attention." 
</P>
<P>
AZOFF: Oddly enough, the lowest-profile label so far is Irving Azoff's new 
venture, which just moved into its new Westside offices this week (a label name 
announcement is also due shortly). Azoff would not discuss his plans on the 
record. But he apparently has lofty ambitions. He told Billboard recently that 
Hollywood's start-up "is like a development deal compared to the commitment I 
have from Warners . . . It (ticks) me off for Paterno to try and claim he's in 
competition with me against anything." Sources close to Azoff said he is 
launching a major merchandising company in addition to recruiting young A&amp;R 
execs, a black music division chief and a label general manager. One name 
frequently mentioned for the latter post is key Warners exec Michael Ostin, but 
Azoff has said in the past that he has agreed not to raid executive talent from 
Warners labels. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE EAGLE'S NEST: Despite what you may have read in the Hollywood Reporter 
earlier this week, there is only -- as one veteran Eagles watcher put it -- a 
100,000 to one chance of the Eagles getting back together. Ever. However, 
here's a news flash: Founding members Don Henley and Glenn Frey have agreed to 
work on a project together. According to sources close to the duo, Elektra is 
planning to release a boxed set of the Eagles' hits, perhaps as early as next 
Christmas. While Elektra can apparently issue the collection without the 
group's official consent, Henley and Frey (who are now speaking again) have 
agreed to listen to the group's old tapes and see what unreleased material 
might be available for inclusion in the package. Sources say "quite a few" 
unfinished tracks are lying around, already equipped with rough vocals, which 
were originally recorded for the band's "Long Run" album. If Henley and Frey 
like what they hear, several unreleased songs (which include a track called 
"Too Much Drama Mama") could end up in the boxed set. Wouldn't that mean Frey 
and Henley would have to overdub new vocals? "If they get excited about what 
they hear," said a longtime Eagles guardian. "I wouldn't rule it out."

'CITY PERSON' IS BOTH ATTRACTED, REPELLED BY MOVING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAMPSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My God, the suburbs!" John Cheever once wrote. "They encircled the city like 
enemy territory and we thought of them as a loss of privacy, a cesspool of 
conformity and a life of indescribable dreariness in some split-level village." 
</P>
<P>
Cheever's essay, "Moving Out," described his wrenching decision to move his 
family from a Manhattan apartment to a house in Westchester County in the late 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades later, Esther Renzer is in the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, David, are preparing to sell their co-op apartment in 
Brooklyn and move to one of two suburban areas: northern New Jersey if David's 
career keeps him in New York or Southern California if it takes him there. 
</P>
<P>
Esther knows that the suburbs will be cleaner, quieter and safer, especially 
for her 2-year-old daughter, Sabrina. But Esther is worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more alive in the city," she said. "It's almost as if I breathe 
differently. I've become a city person." 
</P>
<P>
As a businesswoman, "closet writer" and people-watcher, Esther finds 
inspiration in the city. As a marketer, "my finger has to be on the pulse of 
whatever will motivate sales," she said. "In the city you're more aware of 
that. It's where trends start." 
</P>
<P>
When Cheever moved out, he missed the French-speaking panhandler who used to 
work Beekman Place; the Central Park Zoo lion house at 4 p.m. on February 
afternoons; a bagpiper on the Lexington Avenue subway platform who played a 
Black Watch march between trains. 
</P>
<P>
When she moves, Esther will miss Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 
the old Russian immigrants who sit on benches in her neighborhood and cluck 
over Sabrina. She'll even miss the F train. 
</P>
<P>
In the city, she said, Sabrina "has been exposed to museums, restaurants, 
different kinds of people. I'm afraid of raising her in too sterile an 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
That is, the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
That is where Esther, now on the verge of 30, was once a shy, unappreciated 
teen-ager. "Moving almost represents going back to what I was there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her reluctance also hinges on what she is afraid may be a woman's role 
in the suburban order. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live like 'The Stepford Wives,' " she said, referring to a 
film in which suburban women were like robots. "I don't want to be concerned 
just about my house and my family, and I don't want to have to spend all my 
time driving around. I like street life." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his wife's misgivings and the longer commute to his Manhattan office, 
David Renzer welcomes the move. He is tired of city noise and pollution and 
looks forward to relaxing in his own house and yard after a hard day. And both 
parents think life will be better for Sabrina. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's older, I couldn't let her out alone in the city to ride her bike," 
Esther said. "There's just too many stories." 
</P>
<P>
The Renzers considered moving to Manhattan or buying a weekend house in the 
country. But prices led them to the suburbs. "You get more space for your 
money," Esther said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
She can take heart from Cheever, who became the chronicler of suburbia and one 
of its greatest fans. He enjoyed being able "to shout in anger or joy without 
having someone pound on the radiator for silence," and not having to tip a 
building staff of 20 at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, I'm crazy about the suburbs," he wrote a decade after moving 
out, "and I don't care who knows it."

RX FOR ILLNESS: STUDIES FIND THAT LAUGHTER CAN BE GOOD MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE ESPER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ina Carlson still laughs at life despite two heart attacks and quadruple bypass 
surgery. "Why not?" she asks with a chuckle. "That's what keeps me going. 
Wouldn't it be awful if I sat back and cried?" 
</P>
<P>
No wonder she is the poster patient and spokeswoman for one of a growing number 
of hospitals putting humor into health care amid new evidence suggesting that 
laughter may benefit the ill as well as the healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Laughter indeed may be like a good medicine," said Dr. Lee Berk, of the School 
of Medicine at Loma Linda University. 
</P>
<P>
"Those patients who had the will to live had a sense of humor and were able to 
use their humor in fighting their illness," said Kathy Knight, a nurse at 
University Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M., who founded "Humor And Hospitals Are 
Healthy Allies," -- "HAHAHA" -- the program that Ina Carlson represents. 
</P>
<P>
"I forget about myself when I can laugh with somebody or at somebody," said 
Carlson, an 80-year-old widow, adding that a good joke "makes me feel better. I 
forget that I'm just living on pills." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson, who has been a patient at University Hospital, was having a serious 
picture taken with three doctors for a medical school recruitment brochure when 
Knight decided to have some fun. She put Minnie Mouse ears on Carlson, and 
Goofy, moose and chicken hats on the doctors. "Today, cheer someone up," her 
poster says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't help but look at that picture and laugh," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
Programs such as University Hospital's are spreading, bringing humor to 
patients on their walls and on wheels -- special carts loaded with everything 
from balloons to bubbles, from comic books to comedy videos. 
</P>
<P>
"Research findings are beginning to accumulate that suggest . . . laughter 
might be therapeutic and could be used to reduce disease symptoms," said Lars 
Ljungdahl, of the Lyckorna Primary Health Care Center in Motala, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings in a study of six women suffering painful muscle and bone 
disorders suggested that humor therapy can increase quality of life and relieve 
some chronic symptoms, said Ljungdahl, whose findings were reported in a 
January letter to the Journal of the American Medical Assn. He noted that 
clinical evaluation still is lacking and that further studies are needed. 
</P>
<P>
A new study of 10 people who watched a humor video for two hours and had blood 
samples taken every 10 minutes found decreases in the hormones cortisol and 
epinephrine, or adrenaline, which are released during stress, Berk said. The 
overall effect was a healthy drop in blood pressure, heart rate and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Those hormones also can weaken the immune system and counter the "good" hormone 
endorphin, a painkiller and mood elevator, Berk said. By reducing the flow of 
cortisol and adrenaline, laughter counters the weakening of the immune system 
and allows endorphins to work on pain unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph K. Neumann, a psychologist with the Veterans Administration in Johnson 
City, Tenn., said more controlled studies are needed. "A lot of people who have 
published in this area have reported on case studies or studies with groups of 
people who haven't had an experimental control group." 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that humor is therapeutic, Neumann said it may not be more 
effective than anything else that would induce a pleasant experience, such as 
relaxing music. He studied two groups of patients who underwent surgery under a 
local anesthetic while awake. One group listened to a tape of an old Jack Benny 
radio show and the other group listened to relaxing ocean sounds. "Basically 
there weren't any consistent or significant differences." 
</P>
<P>
Humor is serious business to people such as Joyce Anisman-Saltman, assistant 
professor of special education at Southern Connecticut State University in New 
Haven, and Joel Goodman, head of The HUMOR Project in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Their message on why it is healthy to laugh and how to bring more humor into 
work and life is taken so seriously that they are in big demand by 
organizations ranging from IBM to the Massachusetts Turf Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Major corporations are putting humor into training programs, believing that it 
sparks creativity. "When the world is closing in, you've got to do something to 
change your mood so you can function creatively by looking at a favorite 
cartoon, remembering some silly line, trying to find something silly going on 
in daily life," said Monsanto Co. researcher Robert Z. Greenley in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Anisman-Saltman, who gives five to 10 lectures a week across the country, tells 
audiences to avoid "energy suckers, people who grab you in the hall and only 
have terrible things to tell you about that drag you down. Surround yourself 
with positive people." 
</P>
<P>
Problems can be handled when they are in perspective, she said. "A sense of 
humor helps you take a step back from the problem that looks really terrible up 
close. When you have a little distance from it, it looks less terrible." 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are really coming to their senses of humor," said Goodman, who 
has a network of 100 people across the country working with The HUMOR Project. 
"People are realizing humor is not just kid stuff. People are realizing humor 
can do many good things for us." 
</P>
<P>
Anisman-Saltman, a funny teacher and briefly a stand-up comic, got on the 
lecture circuit six years ago when the library in her hometown of Cheshire, 
Conn., was running a series on healing and invited her to speak. 
</P>
<P>
But stark reality nudged Goodman into a life of humor. In 1977, his father was 
stricken with a life-threatening aneurysm and facing surgery in Houston. A 
funny thing happened to him on his way to the hospital to visit his father: The 
driver of the hotel van, a man named Alvin, made him laugh, easing the stress. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of months later when Dad was successfully recovering, I got to 
thinking what a wonderful gift Alvin had given us. I began to wonder, 'Do we 
have to wait for the Alvins of the world to cross our paths just when we need 
them by luck or should we be more intentional about this thing called humor.' 
</P>
<P>
"I began to think it was too good to leave to chance so in 1977 I started The 
HUMOR Project, which was not designed to analyze humor to death but to answer 
my own curiousity about whether there are practical ways of bringing humor to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
In the last dozen years, more than a quarter of a million people have attended 
HUMOR Project programs, Goodman said. In the last three years, the project also 
has given grants to 36 hospitals and groups to help develop their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, the author of eight books, tells audiences to look for humor in 
reality and in very serious places such as newspapers and church bulletins. 
"That is where humor is most absent at first glance and where it's most 
needed."

SATELLITE LINKS UP AMERICANS AND SOVIETS VIA PERSONAL COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARTON REPPERT, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a youth club in northwest Moscow, 8-year-old Pavlik Teremetsky sat at an 
American-made computer helping three "Island Survivors" build shelter, hunt, 
fish and gather firewood for the approaching winter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he put his experiences into writing: 
</P>
<P>
"I and my friends, Kirill and Misha, went on a trip around the world," he 
wrote. "Our ship ran aground during a bad storm and was destroyed. . . . We 
held on to the remnants of a mast and made it ashore. Very strange creatures 
live there, they look like dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
His story was sent electronically to a microwave station outside the Soviet 
capital for relay via an Intelsat satellite to a ground station in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Its ultimate destination: a small public library in the San Diego suburb of 
Solana Beach, where a group of American children play the same game after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental project involving Soviet and American schoolchildren is one of 
a series undertaken by U.S. public interest groups, peace activists, educators, 
academic researchers and other professionals to try to promote better East-West 
relations and encourage reforms through the use of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The activities include daily exchanges of electronic mail messages between 
computers in the two countries over a new satellite communications network 
linking the United States with Moscow and other major Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, several American experts on Soviet computer 
technology say some of the PC enthusiasts may have naively optimistic 
expectations. They contend that even with more personal computers, the Soviet 
Union is unlikely to develop a Western-style "information society." 
</P>
<P>
The United States now leads the Soviet Union about a hundredfold in numbers of 
personal computers -- approximately 30-million PCs in this country compared to 
between 200,000 and 350,000 in the Soviet Union. Most Soviet PCs are installed 
at schools, universities, research institutes, military bases, factories and 
other enterprises; relatively few are in use at home. 
</P>
<P>
Within the Soviet Union, PCs are extremely expensive. IBM-compatible XT clones 
sell for about 50,000 rubles ($80,000 at the official exchange rate) while AT 
clones go for up to 80,000 rubles ($130,000). 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Bush Administration lifted export controls on the sale of 
IBM-compatible AT and similar desktop computers to the Soviet Union, after 
finding that such PCs were readily available in 11 countries -- including 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was sharply criticized by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who 
contended that it would provide to Moscow computers "with military 
applications" and thus give the Soviets "significant capabilities they do not 
now possess." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), a senior member of the House Committee on 
Science, Space and Technology, said he was in favor of lifting the export 
controls and "moderately optimistic" about the long-term implications of 
increased numbers of personal computers in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It will contribute to the spread of democracy in the Soviet Union, mainly 
because a growing number of what you might call the computer literate or 
computer elite people will have access to a broad base of information about 
what's going on in the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that "will allow them to make better judgments about the changes, 
political and otherwise, that will be necessary in the Soviet Union. And 
they'll be better prepared to act to accomplish some of these changes." 
</P>
<P>
Direct, high-speed communication between computers in the United States and 
Soviet Union has been facilitated by the establishment early last year of the 
San Francisco-Moscow Teleport, which uses data channels relayed by an Intelsat 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Schatz, the American entrepreneur who heads the teleport, and Soviet 
officials signed an agreement Sept. 20 formally creating a joint venture 
between the San Francisco company and the Moscow-based Research Institute of 
Applied Automated Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Schatz said that after more than four years of work, "we have solved the major 
technical and political problems for providing electronic mail service." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that "when we first attempted to connect a computer modem to the 
Moscow telephone network several years ago, we needed approval from the 
Ministry of Communications and half a dozen additional Moscow agencies. Today, 
we simply use alligator clips to connect modems to phone wires without any 
permission." 
</P>
<P>
Schatz attributed the change mainly to the increased familiarity of Soviet 
officials and technical personnel with electronic mail systems. Earlier, he 
said, "this was a new technology for them -- they had never seen E-mail 
before." 
</P>
<P>
A few computer hobbyists have begun exchanging messages via the teleport, but 
most of its users are companies and other organizations. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center in Palo Alto, which has been 
exchanging information with the Institute of Nuclear Science at Novosibirsk in 
western Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
David Leith, a high-energy physicist at the Stanford center, said the 
electronic link has substantially aided communications with Soviet colleagues 
about joint scientific work. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that "our prior communications were by mail, which is long and 
unreliable; by phone, which is difficult; and by telex, which is expensive." 
</P>
<P>
* The Space Studies Institute in Princeton, N.J., which has been using the 
teleport to discuss possible joint space missions with the Moscow Aviation 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
* International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a public interest 
group based in Cambridge, Mass., which used the teleport to communicate with 
its Soviet counterpart about travel plans and other logistics in advance of a 
world conference held in Hiroshima, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* Argus Trading Ltd., a small company based in Rockville, Md., whose business 
includes exports to the Soviet Union of oil pipeline equipment, chemicals and 
machinery for producing electronic circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a potential for it to be a great money saver," said Thomas Anaya, U.S. 
contract manager for Argus, about the electronic mail link. "If you use telexes 
as much as we do, you find that the savings can be tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Americans wanting to use the San Francisco-Moscow Teleport first must get a 
written agreement with a counterpart in the Soviet Union for an electronic mail 
connection. This paper work can take up to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The teleport charges a one-time setup fee of $100. Commercial users pay a 
monthly service fee of $200, while nonprofit groups are charged $25 to $75 per 
month. In addition, there is an on-line connection charge of $15 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
The network's staff offers both English-to-Russian and Russian-to-English 
translation services, at a minimum fee of $30 per message and volume charges of 
up to 35 cents per word. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Soviet teleport is closely tied with PeaceNet, a San Francisco-based 
computer network linking nearly 2,000 subscribers from dozens of peace groups 
in the United States and other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shuman, executive director of the Center for Innovative Diplomacy in 
Irvine, a group instrumental in forming PeaceNet, said he was "very interested 
in ways in which promotion of computer technology can strengthen glasnost and 
perestroika," Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of openness and 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"It may turn out that the real significance of computerization is to inoculate 
the Soviet Union from a dramatic reversal of glasnost," Shuman said. "The more 
that computers and information are spread, the more difficult it will become 
for the government to suddenly rewrite history or pull that information back 
from people." 
</P>
<P>
Communication via the San Francisco-Moscow Teleport also is at the heart of the 
U.S.-Soviet educational effort being led by Michael Cole, a Russian-speaking 
psychology professor at the University of California, San Diego, and Alexandra 
Belyaeva of the Soviet Institute of Psychology in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said "Island Survivors" was among computer games being used because 
"everybody's interested in global consciousness of ecology." He said this 
activity had developed into "a very lively discussion where the kids brought in 
a lot of knowledge beyond the specific game." 
</P>
<P>
In the East-West education project, he said, each side usually sends messages 
in its own language, with bilingual teachers on hand to translate at the other 
end. 
</P>
<P>
The program, conducted after school so that it does not interfere with the 
regular curriculum, involves several dozen children ages 6 to 12 in each 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Test sites in the United States include the Children's School in La Jolla; a 
day-care center associated with the Erikson Institute of Early Education in 
Chicago; Casita Maria, an after-school center in New York City's East Harlem; 
and a center in New Orleans associated with the University of New Orleans. The 
Solana Beach library was used for two years up through last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that although he was pleased by progress achieved in the program so 
far, "there are enormous institutional and cultural barriers to really making 
it anything more than a public relations gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
"I like it as public relations -- it's not bad. But in general, even within the 
United States, when you have the use of electronic mail to amplify educational 
activity, it's much more promise than delivery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other American observers voice mixed feelings about the role of personal 
computers in improving East-West ties and promoting reforms within Soviet 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Chapman, executive director of Computer Professionals for Social 
Responsibility, a public interest group based in Palo Alto, spent three weeks 
in the Soviet Union last spring to get a firsthand look at Soviet computing. 
</P>
<P>
After returning home, Chapman launched a drive to raise $35,000 for personal 
computers and other office equipment to assist Perspektiva, a Moscow 
cooperative affiliated with community groups that offer social services dealing 
with problems such as domestic violence, Afghan war veterans, youth crime and 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Perspektiva operates a clearinghouse of information -- none of it yet 
computerized -- collected from more than 1,200 non-governmental organizations 
across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said he doesn't have particularly high expectations about the value of 
computer technology for enhancing East-West communication. However, he believes 
PCs can play a significant role in aiding the work of progressive organizations 
such as Perspektiva. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bit concerned that a lot of the financial and philanthropic 
support for computerization with respect to the Soviet Union is mainly focused 
on this East-West communication business, and not on supporting indigenous 
efforts that, from my perspective, would have a lot more impact," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Chapman on the trip was Esther Dyson, the Russian-speaking editor 
and publisher of Release 1.0, a New York-based computer industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said she concluded afterward that "it's not enough -- it's like having 
your eyes open but your muscles aren't connected. Until you have the economic 
vitality that comes from really liberating the forces of individual business, 
all this stuff isn't going to do enough." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Judy, director of the Center for Soviet and East European Studies at 
the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, said he estimates there are currently 
about 350,000 personal computers in the Soviet Union, with that number 
increasing by about 100,000 a year -- including both Soviet production and 
imported machines. 
</P>
<P>
However, Judy said that even with a growing number of PCs, their impact within 
Soviet society is likely to be limited, partly because of inadequacies of the 
country's telephone system for carrying computer data. 
</P>
<P>
"To really have a ripple effect that all of us would like to see, fanning out 
horizontally across the population, is going to require much better 
telecommunications. That's just not likely to be in place anytime soon," Judy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour E. Goodman, an expert on Soviet computer technology at the University 
of Arizona, said that in the years ahead "what emerges will no more resemble a 
Western-style information society than Gorbachev's emerging Soviet-style 
democracy will resemble Western-style democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely changes over the next several years range from modest 
increases in technology applications narrowly related to achieving the state's 
main goals, to the attainment of some more ambitious vision of 'enlightened 
collectivism' that has yet to be defined by Soviet academics or technocrats," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman added that "even if the U.S.S.R. undergoes social and economic reforms 
as radical as those of Hungary -- a scenario that is not inconceivable -- 
information technology will still be more tightly controlled and less pervasive 
than in the West."

SEN. LEVIN IS FINDING THE 'PEACE DIVIDEND' TO BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CONSTITUENTS DEMAND TO KNOW HOW THE MONEY SAVED FROM DEFENSE CUTS 
WILL BE SPENT. THE RENEWED ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC ISSUES IS LIKELY TO INFLUENCE 
CONGRESS.

EAST DETROIT, Mich.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) stopped by the Modern Medical Pharmacy recently 
to ask directions to a nearby television station, proprietor Joseph Grimaudo 
took advantage of his captive audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really seeing history change," the exuberant pharmacist told Levin as he 
trailed the senator out the front door. "Take some of the money from armaments 
and give it to the people. . . . There are people (on Medicare and Medicaid) 
who gotta have oxygen and they can't get it." 
</P>
<P>
When Levin finished a meeting on school drug problems with local officials the 
next morning in Allen Park, south of Detroit, a radio reporter asked if the 
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations means that the American military can now 
help more with interdiction of drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
At his next stop, Levin chatted with a group of fifth-graders in nearby South 
Rockwood and picked up on the theme, suggesting that an easing of international 
tensions may mean that the United States can use some of its defense dollars 
for other purposes. Teachers standing in the back of the room did not miss a 
beat in letting him know where they thought the money should go. "Education," 
they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everywhere he went in dawn-to-dusk travels around largely blue-collar, 
ethnic communities outside Detroit, Levin was peppered with questions about the 
waning of the Cold War and its implications for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
With family ties stretching back into Eastern and Central Europe, many of 
Levin's Detroit-area constituents, who include thousands of Democrats who voted 
for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and George Bush last year, remained 
skeptical about Soviet intentions and apprehensive about continued upheaval in 
their ancestral homelands. 
</P>
<P>
But visions of sugar plums were already dancing in many heads. Even among the 
skeptics, the dominant mood was one of hope and rising expectations, tempered 
by a concern over U.S. economic and fiscal problems that is deepened by 
shakiness in Michigan's auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some saw investment and trade opportunities for the United States, even for 
themselves. But most, like Grimaudo, saw opportunities for expansion of 
domestic initiatives, ranging from schools to environmental protection, that 
had been starved for funds during the military buildup of the early 1980s. Few 
appeared to heed the warnings of President Bush and others that it is far too 
early to start spending the so-called "peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by Levin's trip home, the unleashing of a pent-up demand for attention 
to domestic needs, which for some included reduction of the nation's budget 
deficit, appears likely to influence Congress as it heads into its 1990 
election-year session. It also holds out the possibility of a profound change 
in the political direction of the country as it heads into a markedly different 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to change politics down to the grass-roots level," said 
Carl Marlinga, the Democratic prosecutor of Macomb County. "We're going to 
think of the world in a different way . . . without a military nuance to 
everything we talk about . . . . No longer are we going to have to sacrifice 
everything to prepare for war." 
</P>
<P>
But Michigan Republican Party Chairman Spencer Abraham cautioned that foreign 
affairs is usually a cutting issue only in times of crisis and that candidates 
who seek to exploit the issue are usually hurt more than they are helped. "Take 
an extreme position either way and you're likely to be hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sword's double edge is apparent in the case of Levin, a senior member of 
the Senate Armed Services Committee and an ardent foe of moves to expand the 
nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. Levin, who won his two previous races by 
narrow margins, has been targeted by Republicans as a top prospect for an upset 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
While Levin drew nods in the Detroit area for his suggestions that some defense 
money can now be channeled to deficit reduction or domestic needs, he is 
getting "beat up like hell," according to an aide in his state office, in 
communities around Wurtsmith Air Force Base in northern Michigan, which was 
just chosen as one of seven sites for the new rail-based system for the MX 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
Levin opposes the 10-warhead nuclear missile and its new rail-garrison basing 
mode, while Rep. Bill Schuette (R-Mich.), the leading contender for the GOP 
Senate nomination, is trumpeting his support for the program and welcoming the 
missiles to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Levin's weaponry problems do not end with the MX, however. As chairman of the 
Armed Services subcommittee on conventional forces and as an advocate of 
strengthening these forces as opposed to nuclear weaponry, Levin has championed 
the M-1 tank, Michigan's single largest defense project. It accounts for 
thousands of jobs at its Warren, Mich., assembly plant and at other production 
and engineering facilities across the state. But to Levin's dismay, the M-1 
appears a more likely casualty of Pentagon-planned military cutbacks than does 
the MX. 
</P>
<P>
Only days after the Defense Department designated Wurtsmith for the 
MX-on-rails, word leaked from the Pentagon that the Army had proposed to end 
production of the tank after fiscal 1991 as part of its contribution to savings 
mandated by budget cutters. 
</P>
<P>
For others here, the defense spending issue is broader than any single weapons 
system, touching off a re-examination of priorities in a world in which tanks 
as well as missiles appear to be headed for the arms-control bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
Take Henry J. Luks, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Luks, grandson of Polish immigrants, runs a small alarm systems business in 
East Detroit. At a luncheon in Mt. Clemens, he asked Levin about the 
implications of the East-West thaw for the U.S. and Michigan economies. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can reduce some of the defense burden we've had to carry" and use the 
money for education and other endeavors that will enhance the nation's 
productivity, the United States will benefit greatly, Levin responded 
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
Luks seemed a little disappointed and said later that he felt more exhilaration 
than he detected in Levin. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be wrong, but it just seems (like) such a golden opportunity out there 
for everyone . . . a great big pipeline for U.S. products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean he believes the United States can start turning its swords into 
plowshares? "We can cut nuclear weapons that can already blow up the world a 
hundred times over," said Luks, "but until we see a little more good faith 
(from the Soviets), I don't think we should start pulling out troops. I guess 
I'm not ready to run up and give them a kiss and a hug, not yet, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But he would like to do business with them, Luks said. "Think they'd like to 
buy some alarm systems?" he asked.

HIGH-TECH FISHING PERILS ISLAND LIFE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

STROMNESS, Orkney Islands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bridge of the huge trawler Orcades Viking hums with banks of computers and 
sonar that can pick up schools of fish up to two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The crew can then set their nets at the correct depth and scoop up anything in 
their path. Dolphins and even whales have turned up in the catch, said Joseph 
Nicholson, co-owner of the 1,100-ton trawler. 
</P>
<P>
The technology is such that the Viking could catch its whole year's quota of 
mackerel and herring in a week. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential's unlimited, really. The best haul we had last year was 1,500 
tons in one hour's fishing," said Nicholson's partner, Angus Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for the North Sea fish, quotas in Britain are strictly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"Quotas are there so we don't overfish the seas and ruin the future of the 
entire fishing industry," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair and Nicholson sold $1.9-million worth of fish last year and made a 
profit of $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
But many Scottish fishermen think they get a raw deal from the European 
Community and its fishing quotas. 
</P>
<P>
There are enough fish in British waters for the British fishing fleet, said one 
fisherman who declined to be named, "but now that we're in the EC it's all got 
to be shared out. The EC's a bad thing for us." 
</P>
<P>
By a quirk in the rules, Norwegian trawlers are allowed to fish for mackerel 
and herring in the British half of the North Sea but British ships are barred 
from doing the same in the Norwegian sector, fishermen said. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian ships also seem to be subjected to less rigorous controls, they 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
Scottish fleets are allowed to fish mackerel only in season. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Norwegians) seem to be fishing all year, they start the season 
earlier and go on longer," said the fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
The Viking is allowed to take only 4,400 tons of mackerel and 1,500 tons of 
herring a year. 
</P>
<P>
And since EC quotas for 1990, decided in Brussels in December, reduce the 
British quotas for both herring and mackerel, the Viking and other North Sea 
fishing fleets are likely to be allowed to catch even less this year. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Viking has caught its mackerel and herring quota, the ship spends 
several months fishing for less profitable blue whiting, which is not protected 
by quotas. 
</P>
<P>
And for four months during the winter the ship sits idle in its home port of 
Stromness in the Orkney Islands off the northeastern tip of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Although relatively small compared to some of the Norwegian fleet, the Viking 
can hold 1,500 tons of fish at a time. The catch is transferred from nets to 
tanks through a powerful suction tube. 
</P>
<P>
Moored in Stromness harbor, the Viking dwarfs the brightly painted wooden 
fishing boats bobbing beside it and the modest stone cottages around the port. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair and Nicholson are both natives of these bleak, wind-swept islands. 
Nicholson started in business by buying a rowboat, went on to buy a second and 
then moved up to a fishing boat. When that got too small, he got a Norwegian 
shipyard to cut it in half and add a new middle section. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago he and Sinclair bought the Viking for $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member crew of local men earn wages that are generous for the islands, 
where a three-bedroom house can be had for a quarter of the price of an 
apartment in London. 
</P>
<P>
Now in their mid-30s, Sinclair and Nicholson are among the most affluent men in 
a community that makes its living largely from sheep farming, fishing, whiskey 
distilling and a small number of tourists.

BAND MEMBER TURNED IN TROMBONE FOR PULPIT

<P>
You can't really blame the organist at St. Mary's for chasing after Msgr. John 
Sanders to get up there in the choir loft with his valve trombone. 
</P>
<P>
If the monsignor could lift the congregation the way those cats were lifted out 
of their chairs and into the aisles, stomping and screaming, at 2 a.m. in that 
unforgettable climax to the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival, there would be no need 
for a sermon and hardly anybody would be ducking out before the second 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of decades ago, when the Big Band era was in its final full cry, John 
Sanders held down the middle chair in Duke Ellington's trombone section. 
</P>
<P>
Birdland. The Blue Note in Chicago. Boston's Storyville and Ritz Carlton Roof. 
Carnegie Hall. The Savoy Ballroom and the Apollo Theater up in Harlem. The 
Paramount and Loew's State on Broadway. London's Royal Festival Hall. 
</P>
<P>
John Sanders was up there on the bandstand in white tie and tails sending out 
sensuous solos and melding joy and sighs into melodic arrangements of "Mood 
Indigo," "I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good," "Take the A Train," "I'm Beginning 
to See The Light," "Don't Mean a Thing If You Ain't Got That Swing," "I Let a 
Song Go Out of My Heart" and other Ellington classics. 
</P>
<P>
But coming out of Salt Lake City one night, the reading light came on over the 
right front row seat in the band bus. That meant Duke had an inspiration and 
was composing again. 
</P>
<P>
Then the reading light came on over the seat just behind. John Sanders, who 
served as Ellington's copyist on the road, was beginning to see the light, a 
different light. He was absorbed in pamphlets about delayed vocations to the 
Roman Catholic priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was past 30 and really thought it was too late, but the idea was always on 
my mind," said this son of a New York Harlem postal clerk. "So I dropped in for 
a chat with a priest in Salt Lake City. He urged me to look into what I was 
going to do with the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders also received encouragement from the Rev. Norman O'Connor, a Paulist 
priest who had a radio jazz show in Boston and was master of ceremonies at that 
Newport Jazz Festival when the Ellington band made the police nervous by 
igniting the crowd to a dancing frenzy with a scorching rendition of 
"Diminuendo in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
It seems like only yesterday the world was John Sanders' bandstand: Hollywood, 
London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. But now, he does his solo turns from the pulpit 
and confessional of an inner-city parish in Norwalk, a decaying factory town 
trying to make a comeback as a historic seaport. 
</P>
<P>
Soul has a deeper meaning for this dedicated man with a horn who at the 
Christmas midnight Mass retreated into the past from his usual pastoral duties 
to lift his trombone toward the altar for a triumphant rendition of "Once in 
Royal David's City." 
</P>
<P>
"Do I miss the old days?" He ponders the question he sometimes asks himself on 
his knees in his nightly examination of conscience. "Yes, I really do. But not 
in the sense of longing to go back. I treasure those memories. Duke made dreams 
come true of everything I wanted to do or be as a musician." 
</P>
<P>
Those memories began with a sixth-grader at St. Mark's parochial school in 
Harlem investing 25 cents of the dollar he got for his 11th birthday in a 
balcony seat at the Apollo Theater on New York's 125th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always an Ellington fan, before, during and after," confesses the 
monsignor, who still rummages through record stores and garage sales for 
additions to his collection of Duke albums. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders took the A-train to the High School of Commerce, where Lincoln Center 
now stands. He played trombone in the school band, which won him assignment to 
"those fine Navy bands at Great Lakes and San Diego" at the close of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
He studied composition and arranging under the GI Bill at New York's Juilliard 
School and began "doing gigs" with Lucky Thompson's orchestra at the Savoy 
ballroom and some club dates with Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, who had his own 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"One night Duke needed a substitute trombonist and Mercer recommended me. It 
was like a dream come true," Sanders recalls in his tiny rectory office, his 
eyes flickering like high altar candles. "I always thought he was beyond my 
reach and never met him until I went backstage at the Apollo. He loaned me a 
jacket, handed me some music and told me I'd be OK. 
</P>
<P>
"They were closing that night with Pearl Bailey. I played the second show. Duke 
suggested I come out on the road with them for a few nights. He didn't say 
where we were going or for how long. We went to the South and out through 
Texas. Four months went by. We wound up in San Diego and I didn't get home 
until April." 
</P>
<P>
Memories warmed that rectory cubicle more than the afternoon sun faintly 
filtering through the lace curtains: Going to Hollywood to record Duke's sound 
track for "Anatomy of a Murder," playing President Lyndon B. Johnson's White 
House and Carnegie Hall with Ella Fitzgerald, crossing the Atlantic on the Ile 
de France to do a command performance for the queen and that other duke, the 
Duke of Edinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz then was America's most popular export, and Ellington's recordings led all 
Continental charts. "The Europeans took our music very seriously. They knew 
everyone in the band," he said. "I'll never forget the Royal Festival Hall. As 
each of us came on stage they applauded us, like players coming on the field at 
the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Duke and his valve trombonist came home on the Queen Mary. A few weeks later 
Sanders had a confession to make. He told Ellington he was leaving the band to 
find himself. 
</P>
<P>
An incident during rehearsals at the Blue Note in Chicago eased some of the 
pain. "Duke called me over to the piano and played something serene and 
meditative. I told him it was beautiful. It was an accompaniment to the 'Our 
Father' he was writing for a sacred concert with Mahalia Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I never talked religion with Duke and wasn't conscious he belonged to any 
particular denomination. But his whole way of doing things and how he dealt 
with us musicians showed a respect and warmth for the individual that I think 
is very spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
"God was treated reverently on the bandstand, too. Duke was very generous with 
requests, but there was one he would always bypass. If someone requested, as 
they usually did, 'When the Saints Go Marchin' In,' he wouldn't touch it. He 
felt that with all the other music available, why risk making fun of what his 
mother taught him as a hymn." 
</P>
<P>
Ellington hated to lose a fine trombonist and, even rarer, an expert copyist. 
"He was very fatherly about my decision," Sanders said. "He kept saying: 'Do 
what you got to do and make it work for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was ordained on Feb. 10, 1973, by Bishop Walter Curtis of Bridgeport. Duke 
couldn't get to the ordination; he was off doing one-nighters. 
</P>
<P>
But the next day, when the new priest celebrated his first Mass at St. Pius V 
Church in the Jamaica section of New York City, where his family had moved, "lo 
and behold, there was Duke sitting in the front pew and, my, it was wonderful 
to see him." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Duke was dead and Sanders was among the mourners at New York's 
St. John the Divine Cathedral listening to Ella Fitzgerald sing his haunting 
"Solitude."

STATISTICS ARE HIS AMMUNITION IN THE BATTLE AGAINST CIGARETTES 
</P>

<P>
He doesn't sport anti-smoking badges or constantly spout smoke-and-croak 
warnings like his more militant comrades. Nonetheless, Gus Miller is relentless 
in his campaign to snuff out what he considers America's No. 1 drug -- 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
His is a solitary, relatively quiet war. His ammunition is statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a scientist. I'm also a pragmatist. And to me, the best way to do it is to 
just chip away," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old statistician has been poking into America's penchant to puff 
since 1972, when he launched Studies on Smoking, a nonprofit research group, 
from his Edinboro home in northwestern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Miller quit his job as a math and computer science professor at 
Edinboro University to devote all his time to seek out the perils of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is this so important to me? Because cigarettes are responsible for 400,000 
premature deaths a year," he said. "I've seen so many of my family or my 
friends die needlessly because they smoked." 
</P>
<P>
He manages, he said, to push personal feelings aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's an emotional issue," said Miller, an ardent nonsmoker who despises 
cigarette smoke. "But I teach stop-smoking clinics, so you have to use 
psychology. You can't get emotional about it." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 million Americans smoke cigarettes, according to a 1989 report by 
then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. An additional 40 million would be smoking 
if not for changes in an increasingly health-conscious environment, the report 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's efforts to publicize his message have been thwarted at times, he said, 
because of who he is -- or rather who he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not a member of 'the club' and you're not an M.D. and you want to 
get into medical journals, you've got problems," said Miller, who has a 
doctorate in educational psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"The club," he explains, "is the people who get all the grant money and 
publish. That's the club." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Shopland, public health adviser for the National Cancer Institute's 
smoking, tobacco and cancer program, acknowledges most published data on 
smoking is financed through federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Except for occasional, small donations from industry, Miller finances his own 
research. He figures he's spent $60,000 to $70,000 over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a fairly rare bunch who are doing their own individual research with 
their own individual funds," Shopland said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such obstacles, Miller has had several dozen articles published in 
professional periodicals. He signs his work as G.H. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also has presented his findings at scientific conferences around the 
world, including a symposium on cancer prevention in France last April. There, 
he reported an eight- to nine-times greater risk of cancer among nonsmoking 
women who live with smokers than those in smoke-free homes. He based his 
conclusion on a study of 906 nonsmoking women from surrounding Erie County who 
died from 1975 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In late October and early November, Miller attended the fifth General 
Chautauqua Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations at the University of Pittsburgh. 
He spent the week urging Soviet medical officials to adopt more stringent 
no-smoking measures. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yuri Lopukhin, director of the Research Institute for Physiochemical 
Medicine in Moscow and an expert on addiction, was impressed with Miller's work 
and would like him to visit the Soviet Union to share his views. 
</P>
<P>
Although anti-tobacco education has been offered in Soviet schools the last 
five to 10 years and stop-smoking programs are available for adults, the 
efforts have not made much of a dent in the country's large smoking population, 
Lopukhin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Miller) is, yes, helpful. He is very active," Lopukhin said. "But 
he maybe does not succeed so much in this very heavy problem in your country 
and our country, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Institute, a trade association representing U.S. cigarette 
manufacturers, has criticized Miller for being non-scientific in his collection 
and analysis of data. 
</P>
<P>
"And of course you get that from your fellow scientists who say, 'No, your data 
is invalid' because it varies from what they have found," Miller said. "You 
see, my problem is I'm always on the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Garfinkel, vice president of epidemiology and statistics for the 
American Cancer Society, is among those researchers skeptical of Miller's work 
on secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't agree with the methods he uses," Garfinkel said. "He may 
have done some of the early work (on passive smoking). I can tell you when they 
cite the studies that have been done, they don't include his very often." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general's 1989 report concludes that secondhand smoke can cause 
lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers. In addition, children of parents who smoke 
have an increased frequency of respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
More than one in every six deaths in the United States is due to cigarette 
smoking, according to the surgeon general. Smoking is responsible for an 
estimated 30% of all cancer deaths -- including 87% of lung cancer deaths, 21% 
of deaths from heart disease and 18% of stroke deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"Cigarettes are much more deadly, much, much more deadly" than narcotics, 
Miller said. "They're much more addictive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we try to push for getting laws strengthened and churn out research 
articles showing how bad active smoking is and how bad passive smoking is." 
</P>
<P>
Like many Americans, Miller was unaware of all the risks when he decided in 
1972 to take on smoking. He was prompted into action after talking to a nurse 
about the varying life spans of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
"I mentioned to her that to me it was pretty obvious smoking has something to 
do with the male-female longevity difference, and the reason I knew that is my 
father was a heavy smoker. He got emphysema. He tried to quit several times and 
he got wiped out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Well, where's your data?' So I figured, well, let me go chase 
around and look for data." 
</P>
<P>
Miller began sorting through Erie County death notices in 1972 in his spare 
time, noting those people who were at least 30 when they died. By the following 
year, he was interviewing survivors to see whether the dead had smoked. 
</P>
<P>
He found after analyzing the life styles of about 500 people that men and women 
lived to about the same age if they did not smoke. There was a difference of 16 
years, however, between smoking and nonsmoking women and a 12-year gap between 
smoking and nonsmoking men. The Journal of Breathing published his findings in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was more there," he said. "I started going full blast." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, after compiling data on 3,500 more subjects with the help of 
volunteers, Miller issued a second report showing similar longevity results. 
</P>
<P>
Miller ventured into the controversial area of secondhand smoke in the late 
1970s and since has devoted most of his time to it. 
</P>
<P>
In a particularly controversial study published in 1984, he reported a 
significantly higher risk of cancer among unemployed women whose husbands 
smoked compared to those whose husbands did not. He based his conclusions on 
842 Erie County residents who died in 1975 and 1976.

A man has been arrested in the theft of $20 million in jewelry from the royal 
palace in Saudi Arabia, allegedly stealing it from the bedroom of the prince's 
consort, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kriangkrai Tejamoke is accused of taking the jewelry from the palace of Prince 
Faisal Bin Fahad in Riyadh while working as a cleaner there last year. 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry belonged to the prince's consort and was kept in three unlocked 
safes in her bedroom, said Gen. Sawaeng Theerasawat, Thailand's national police 
chief. The Saudi Embassy estimated the jewelry was worth about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis want Kriangkrai returned for trial, but Thailand has refused because 
it has no extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia, Sawaeng said. 
</P>
<P>
Kriangkrai was charged in Thailand with robbery. If convicted, he will face a 
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

WOMAN IN ABORTION FUROR IMPROVING

A woman who underwent an abortion while in a coma in a desperate attempt to 
improve her chances of recovering from a car accident is now able to talk and 
recognizes family members, a published report said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Klein, 32, whose family fought all the way to the Supreme Court to gain 
permission for the abortion, is doing "amazingly well" and is slowly regaining 
her memory, the New York Times quoted family members and doctors as saying. 
</P>
<P>
A pregnant Klein lapsed into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car 
accident on Long Island on Dec. 13, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors determined an abortion would greatly improve her chances of recovery. 
But abortion foes fought to gain guardianship over her in a bid to stop the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion activists took the matter all the way to the Court of Appeals, 
the state's highest court, which sided with Klein's husband, Martin, and ruled 
doctors could perform the operation. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
After the Feb. 11, 1989, abortion, Nancy Klein was transferred to the Center 
for Head Injuries at the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Rehabilitation Institute in 
Edison, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"She's doing amazingly well," said Caroline McCagg, medical director of the 
center. "She's made slow, constant progress. It's incredible."

EX-REVOLUTIONARY TAKES FRANKFURT POST

<P>
FRANKFURT, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is a German-Jewish former student revolutionary in France doing heading 
Frankfurt's Sikh community? 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, known as "Dany the Red" during the 1968 student revolt in 
France, has been asked to fill in while two rival Sikh groups battle over the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of his job as Frankfurt's councilor for multicultural affairs, 
the latest phase in Cohn-Bendit's unconventional career. 
</P>
<P>
The office was created at his suggestion after a coalition of the Greens and 
Social Democratic parties managed to oust the previous conservative Christian 
Democratic government in March. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become, whether we like it or not, a land of immigrants," Cohn-Bendit, 
44, said. "And we have to develop strategies for these different cultures to 
live together." 
</P>
<P>
The new multicultural office aims to help foreigners -- more than 20% of 
Frankfurt's population -- obtain residence permits and find their way in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Since his student days, Cohn-Bendit has become one of the most controversial 
figures in West German leftist circles. 
</P>
<P>
He has enraged environmentalists in Frankfurt because he does not share their 
outright opposition to skyscraper construction and because he believes the 
neo-Nazi National Democratic Party should be not be banned from elections and 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a radical democrat who believes that a democracy must be so strong that 
it can function without prohibition," said one co-worker at "Pflasterstrand 
(Asphalt Beach)," the alternative Frankfurt magazine Cohn-Bendit publishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've known him, Dany has been a controversial figure because he had the 
courage to say what other people had not yet dared to think," one fellow member 
of the Greens Party said. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, Cohn-Bendit has angered the mainstream by advocating 
amnesties for Red Army Faction guerrillas who renounce violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some skepticism about having a former revolutionary as a government 
official, but those reservations are gone now," Jo Meergans, leader of 
Frankfurt's Social Democrats, said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohn-Bendit was born in France in 1945. His parents had fled from Berlin in 
1933 but he returned to West Germany and became a citizen there at the age of 
15. 
</P>
<P>
"I applied for citizenship because it was easier to travel with a German 
passport than if you are stateless," Cohn-Bendit said. "Plus my father had told 
me German Jews don't have to do military service, so it seemed the best thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 the 19-year-old redhead returned to France to study sociology at 
Nanterre University. Two years later, he led the occupation of university 
buildings to demand radical change, not just in the education system but in 
society at large. 
</P>
<P>
The protests sparked student and worker unrest across France and unleashed a 
political crisis leading to the 1969 downfall of President Charles De Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
The French government subsequently branded Cohn-Bendit undesirable and banned 
him from entering the country for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the revolt in Paris last year, 
Cohn-Bendit told French students: "We have not turned our backs on our ideals. 
We still want change but have given up fantasies of a dramatic, radical 
overhaul." 
</P>
<P>
His work and opinions have made Cohn-Bendit highly popular in West Germany, but 
he is not interested in joining parliament, even if the Greens succeed in 
joining a future government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"Me away from Frankfurt? Nah," he says. "For one, I don't want to go to Bonn. 
Second, I don't want to end as a career politician. I need a certain amount of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the higher you want to go in the party, the more you have to box 
yourself in and I don't like that," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
It shows. Cohn-Bendit has worked as a kindergarten helper, a bookseller, a 
journalist and, of course, a politician. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he says, he'd like to get into television, adding: "I already have a few 
projects up my sleeve."

RACIAL BALANCE PROVES TO BE AN ELUSIVE GOAL FOR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES 
</P>

TEANECK, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real estate agent told George Powell that the owner of the four-bedroom, 
two-bath house on which he had made a bid was taking it off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, a Philip Morris executive with a wife and three children, was 
suspicious for two reasons: He is black and the owner of the house was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the suburbs, Mr. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
George Powell was the exception -- he fought back. He sued the real estate 
agent and a local open-housing group picketed the house. Finally, the Powells 
became Teaneck residents. 
</P>
<P>
That was 20 years ago. Today, the Powells are still exceptional: They live on 
an integrated street in an integrated suburb -- an environment that is still 
beyond the reach of most black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of blacks was part of the foundation of American suburbia. Leases 
in Levittown, N. Y., the largest and best known postwar housing tract, limited 
occupants to "members of the Caucasian race." 
</P>
<P>
If he admitted blacks, William Levitt insisted, whites wouldn't buy. "It was a 
question of economics," he later said. "We can't take on the functions of the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Although 12% of Americans are black, only 6% of all suburbanites are black. 
</P>
<P>
But between 1970 and 1980, the last full decade for which statistics are 
available, the black share of suburban population increased 40%. Some of the 
most famous suburbs -- Oak Park and Park Forest, Ill., and Shaker Heights, Ohio 
-- have growing black communities. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue University sociologist John Stahura says that blacks "are suburbanizing 
at a faster pace than whites. There's a pent-up black demand for suburban 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
Stahura also said that blacks tend to wind up in the older, larger and poorer 
communities that are closest to the cities and often seem more urban than 
suburban. One extreme example is Ford Heights, a predominantly black community 
of 5,300 south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Heights always was more industrial than residential, and when industry 
left, unemployment soared past 50%. An annual per capita income of $4,943 makes 
Ford Heights the nation's poorest suburb, according to one survey. 
</P>
<P>
The town has sought to attract the kinds of employers most suburbs fight to 
keep out: a fireworks factory, a state prison, a garbage incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of such poverty pockets, suburban blacks generally enjoy a higher 
standard of living than their city cousins. There is one constant, however: 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Block-by-block studies have found that suburbs are just as segregated as the 
cities: 25 of the nation's 300 largest metropolitan areas contain about 
three-fifths of all black suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, history suggests that an "integrated" suburb is probably a former 
all-white suburb in the process of becoming all black. 
</P>
<P>
Although Oak Park and Shaker Heights have devised intricate strategies to 
maintain racial balance, they are doomed to fail, Stahura said. Both 
communities, he said, are surrounded by predominantly black neighborhoods and 
will become black, middle-class communities themselves. 
</P>
<P>
So far, this has not happened in Teaneck, a town of 37,000 near the bridge 
between northern New Jersey and New York City. The median house price is around 
$260,000 and the racial mix (64% white, 24% black, the rest Asian, Latino and 
others) approximates that of greater New York. 
</P>
<P>
Teaneck prides itself on its racial and ethnic diversity. A former mayor, who 
is black, calls it a "community of communities." This idea dates back to 1954, 
when the Army designated Teaneck -- which then had several black families -- a 
model town worthy of emulation by the subjugated Germans and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
When blacks started moving into northeastern Teaneck in increasing numbers, 
some white families were quick to sell. Other whites posted "Not for Sale" 
signs on their lawns and passed an ordinance to stop real estate agents from 
stampeding owners into selling. In 1964, Teaneck became the first community in 
the nation to use busing to integrate its schools voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
But even in Teaneck, there is a limit to integration. 
</P>
<P>
George Powell says he often is the only black at a wedding or funeral, and his 
contact with most of his neighbors extends only to an occasional wave. 
</P>
<P>
"There is educational integration and there is residential integration but 
there isn't social integration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two separate societies," he added. "It's a matter of choice. The 
races work together and live together, but don't play together."

MONEY KEEPS MANY OUT OF SUBURBIA

They gather at dawn, standing in small groups at bus stops or corners, waiting 
for their ride. Jesse Jackson sums up their working life in five words: "They 
take the early bus." 
</P>
<P>
They are the long-distance commuters of the working class, the thousands of 
city residents who haul themselves out to suburbia because that is the only 
place they can get a decent job. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Johnson, 50, lives in southeastern Atlanta and works as a clerk at a 
pharmacy in a shopping center north of the city. It's a 40-minute drive, but 
Johnson doesn't own a car. Instead, she has to take a two different buses 
because there is no direct service. She rises before dawn to catch the 6:30 
a.m. bus to be sure of arriving on time for the store's 8 a.m. opening. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of vehicles on the roads of Greater Atlanta has doubled in 
the last five years, commuting times have remained fairly constant because 
employers have moved closer to suburban residents. 
</P>
<P>
"That don't help me," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
The older railroad suburbs had areas near the station where servants and other 
workers could live. But in an attempt to secure privacy and security in an 
increasingly dense suburban fabric, many of the expensive new residential 
communities and the most prosperous business centers are built out of reach of 
those most in need of housing and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Many new suburbs are designed to make sure that residents live only with other 
people like themselves. In a sort of residential dating service, developers and 
real-estate agents match elderly with elderly, singles with singles, families 
with families, tennis players with tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no place for the poor and inadequate public transportation, 
these communities lack hands to flip hamburgers, mow lawns, wash cars. This 
labor shortage is advertised in a million store windows: "Help Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Some communities drop all pretenses of pluralism and resort to walls, gates and 
moats. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, residents of Miami Shores, Fla., voted to raise property taxes to 
barricade the community to through traffic and, they hoped, criminals. An even 
more extreme example is Atlantis, a walled, gated and guarded community in Palm 
Beach County that hired a former Secret Service agent as its manager. 
</P>
<P>
But money is the most effective barrier to suburbia; a single-family home is 
becoming so expensive that even the children of the middle class are finding 
admission prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
Suburbs designed to solve the housing problem now are part of it. When William 
Levitt began building the first of 17,000 houses on Long Island, N.Y., in 1948, 
the nation faced the worst housing shortage before or since. 
</P>
<P>
GIs -- men who saved the nation from Hitler, only to find themselves sleeping 
on in-laws' couches, under cars and in chicken coops -- lined up overnight to 
buy houses for $65 a month and nothing down. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the federal subsidies that built Levittown are gone, and the town's 
average house price (around $160,000) is low only in comparison to prices in 
other New York suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
When Daphyne Rus and her family moved to Levittown in 1959, they were able to 
get a three-bedroom house with only $400 down. But when her own son was ready 
to move out years later, he had to rent a room from her for several years 
before he could afford a place of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Levittown was very good to us," Daphyne Rus said. "I really feel for young 
people today. They need another Levitt."

BEHIND THOSE GATES;

<P>
THEY ARE A HOT REAL ESTATE MARKETING TOOL, BUT THE CASE FOR THEM ISN'T 
OPEN-AND-SHUT

<P>
Bill Dean has this nightmare about the future of his hometown Encinitas. In his 
dream, he sees not trees or ocean vistas, but walls -- one solemn-looking 
gate-guarded community after another. 
</P>
<P>
He sees the huge electronic gates erected to protect the timid residents 
within, whose homes have been swallowed up by these new and imposing fortresses 
that effectively shut out everyone -- even police and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The communities one day could change Encinitas from an easygoing seaside town 
of convivial middle-class neighborhoods, flower fields and funky downtown 
diners to a collection of suburban city-states, the Encinitas city planning 
commissioner fears. 
</P>
<P>
"On Halloween, the kids who go trick-or-treating will have to have five or six 
different gate keys just to be able to reach all the houses in their area," 
Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
"And when their parents throw block parties, they'll only get to see the people 
who live within their own four walls." 
</P>
<P>
Gates and protective walls, once the domain of the rich and influential, are a 
hot marketing tool for developers in San Diego County to sell scores of newly 
built middle-class housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
However, along with their popularity among home buyers has come mounting 
concern among city officials such as Dean, who caution that the trend toward 
walled communities presents serious safety concerns and threatens to forever 
alter the face of suburban North County. 
</P>
<P>
Gated communities, Dean says, are one more questionable aspect of "the Los 
Angelization of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
"There may be a reason for all these gates up in L.A., but as someone 
responsible for the planning of Encinitas, they are not a design element I want 
to see incorporated here. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because it's become a successful marketing trend doesn't mean we should 
all jump on the bandwagon. I mean, pet rocks were a trend, too. And I didn't go 
out and start hoarding them, either." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, however, say the gates provide added security, cut down on 
nuisance traffic and burglaries -- along with sealing out the pressures of the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Edde says your point of view depends on what side of the gate you're 
sitting on. A real estate agent who sits on the board of directors of the 
gate-guarded subdivision Encinitas Real, he says the gates let him sleep better 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that some creep isn't going to pull a truck up to my garage and unload 
all my belongings at will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And sure, the gates are elitist, he adds. "It's not like buying your first 
Mercedes, it's not saying you've finally arrived. But it does say that you 
value your success and feel you have the right to limited access to your 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of resentment from the general public who feel they're closed 
out. They don't like not being able to drive through every neighborhood. Well, 
that's tough. Go buy into your own gated community. 
</P>
<P>
"Because my feeling is, if you don't live in the area, and you're not a guest, 
you're not necessarily welcome there anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire authorities across the North County, however, fear the gates 
may one day backfire in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
Although fire departments keep keys to the gates, many officials worry that the 
attempt at added security might slow firefighters, police or medical personnel 
from reaching the scene of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Officials point to a 1988 incident in Encinitas in which paramedics responding 
to a heart attack call were momentarily sidelined by an electronic gate the 
city had erected at the request of residents to cut down on traffic through 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The delay caused to rescuers was a critical factor in the death of Charles 
Coble, according to his wife, Rosita, who has filed a wrongful death suit 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to believe that these gates create an atmosphere of security," 
said Coble's attorney, Joel Pressman. "In this instance, however, the gate 
caused a disaster for my client. It delayed paramedics from getting to her 
husband." 
</P>
<P>
The Encinitas fire marshal is also outspoken on the subject of gated 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate 'em," said Chief Ron McCarver. "Anything that tends to slow down 
emergency response time, I'm dead set against." 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, 
there are more than 35 gated subdivisions in Encinitas, Del Mar and Solana 
Beach alone -- along with at least 20 more in both Vista and Oceanside, city 
officials there say. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not counting all the trailer parks that have recently erected walls 
around themselves, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
That's too many gates, McCarver said. For one, he said, security precautions 
differ at each gated neighborhood. Some provide a key for fire officials. And 
several of the newer ones feature a gate mechanism triggered by the flashing 
strobe light of a fire engine or ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Several North County fire marshals have urged officials in their cities to 
modify the fire code to require gates protecting four or more homes to be 
equipped with the strobe-light opening system. 
</P>
<P>
But those systems cost money for the department to buy the special lights, 
McCarver said. And even they aren't fool-proof. 
</P>
<P>
"If the power goes out, nothing works," he said. "There's no backup power to 
many of these systems. In that case, the emergency driver has to get out and 
engage a device that allows him to open the gate by hand. And then you're 
wasting precious time." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kee, a patrol sergeant for the Sheriff's Department's Encinitas 
substation, said that the strobe light system is too expensive to equip every 
patrol car. Instead, patrol officers are given numerical codes they can punch 
into a control box to get past a gate. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have as many gated communities as we have nowadays, you can't 
remember all the codes," he said. "You write them down and you still lose them. 
There's so many of them, sometimes you get confused." 
</P>
<P>
Residents living within gated communities have complained about slow response 
after stymied deputies entered the wrong gate code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The question that I have is, 'Are we going to be able to get on the inside of 
one of those things on time when a real emergency breaks out?' " 
</P>
<P>
McCarver worries that non-walled neighborhoods will join the gating trend, 
creating more slowdowns for emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a public hearing at my mother-in-law's housing development (in 
Encinitas), where they were considering installing one of these gates," he 
said. "They had this real estate guy standing up there telling these people 
that their property values would go sky-high if they became a gated community." 
</P>
<P>
Realtors estimate that gates add about 5% to the value of a home, or about 
$10,000 for a $200,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
"I left that meeting with a pretty good idea of the thinking behind many of 
these gated communities. They're not so much for security as they are a 
prestige thing. They put money in people's pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Builders say, however, that the walls are erected to keep unwanted people out, 
not to pull buyers in. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the security aspect is important," said Eve Hager, vice president 
of sales and marketing of Davidson Communities, which has constructed three 
gated communities in La Jolla, Del Mar and Rancho Santa Fe, as well as 
non-gated developments. 
</P>
<P>
She said the appeal of the gated communities is mainly to the "move-down 
buyer," retirement age owners who buy a less expensive attached home and spend 
much of the time away. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts their mind at ease, when they're gone for months at a time, to know 
that their home is left safely behind a locked gate." 
</P>
<P>
Hager said elitism was the furthest thing from the mind of most buyers of gated 
communities. And forget that stuff about not fitting into the scheme of the 
larger community, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our developments fit well into the communities they're in," she said. "We're 
not into walled compounds. There's no spikes or gun turrets at the top of the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Because our intention isn't to segregate people. Our developments may have 
gates, but they're not fortresses." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the housing industry is so pleased with the gated community 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Van Cleave, vice president and general manager of the San Diego office 
of the Marquis Management Group, which manages the homeowners' associations for 
25 gated communities here, said the gates pose a constant maintenance problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a headache," she said. "Mechanically speaking, I can't think of one 
gate that we haven't had at least one major problem with in the past year." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the word 'security' is now avoided by builders when referring to 
their gate-guarded communities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been lawsuits filed back and forth over the fact of whether they 
actually do provide security. I mean, people who live behind them have been 
robbed, their homes have been broken into. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the developers have changed their language to say the gates provide a 
'secure environment.' To me, it's more like providing a reassuring feeling of 
being separate, but not necessarily security." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to gated communities, San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau, a resident 
of the 86-home walled-in subdivision Walnut Hill, isn't exactly a satisfied 
customer either. 
</P>
<P>
Unaware of the gates when he bought the home, he was none too pleased when he 
later got the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't too excited," he said. "They're a hassle. They break down. But it 
means something to others, prestige and security, in their minds." 
</P>
<P>
And, although his City Council last month approved yet another such community, 
Thibadeau has his reservations when it comes to emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it sounds crazy, but the developer forgot to let the Police Department 
know the access code to our gate," he said. "So, right now, the police can't 
get in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic, I guess. I live in a gated community, but I'm more vulnerable 
than if I lived on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Bill Dean of Encinitas decided to take a stand on the gate-guarded 
community concept, casting the deciding vote on the planning commission's 
decision to refuse a local apartment complex permission to install a gate for 
security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment owners appealed to the City Council and eventually won their case 
in a unanimous vote. But Dean isn't giving up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending a message to developers that their future plans for gated 
communities aren't always going to sail through with flying colors, that 
sometimes there's going to be some public outcry against them." 
</P>
<P>
And his idea is gaining support among other city planners -- especially in 
Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"They're insular," Craig Jones, senior city planner, said of the subdivisions. 
"They're like a group of neighbors turning their backsides to the rest of us, 
saying we'll take care of ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, I think, they've become a knee-jerk formula for development 
that isn't necessarily appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said, however, that the City Council 
isn't going to issue rubber-stamp refusals to requests for gate-guarded 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Like others, she says the gates can be a way to reduce the city budget for 
roads upkeep because residents of these subdivisions build and maintain their 
own roads and street lights. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Dean lives on a cul-de-sac, so he doesn't know about traffic and other 
concerns," she said. "A lot of people have a hard time seeing past their own 
noses when it comes to appreciating what others put up with. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to go back 50 years when people felt secure in their own 
homes. But things are vastly different today. They don't feel secure now. So, 
if people want a gated community and can demonstrate strong public support for 
it, I won't stand in their way." 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical Problems 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Susan Schena, a reporter for the San Diego Business Journal, 
bought one of the 142 tract homes in Encinitas Real. Since then, she says, the 
gates have provided one irritation after another. 
</P>
<P>
Her community has tried three different types of gates, including one that 
slides to the side, one that swings inward and another that raises up. All 
three versions have remained broken much of the time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When homeowners recently voted on purchasing yet another type of gate, Schena 
suggested that residents remove it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happiest when the gates aren't working, then I can just drive right 
through," she said. "And they're generally broken. They usually work, though, 
when we have parties, so people have to wait to get in. 
</P>
<P>
"They also work when we order a pizza, so the kid has to call us from the 
nearby 7-Eleven. But they apparently didn't work the night we got robbed." 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween night, a burglar hit several homes on Schena's walled-in street, 
including her own. 
</P>
<P>
"People always use the excuse about the gates cutting down traffic and adding 
security, but I don't buy it," she said. "I'll tell you one thing, though, I'd 
never buy into one again." 
</P>

SMALL-TIME BREWERIES IN SAN DIEGO TAP INTO TREND OF DESIGNER SUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurant owner Paul Dobson appreciates finely crafted beers and ales. He 
enjoys drinking them and serving them in his three downtown restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, who describes himself as "insane about good beers," even planned to 
open a small downtown brewery to make his own brand of beers and ales. 
</P>
<P>
The planned microbrewery near Horton Plaza went flat because of a California 
law that prohibits people with hard-liquor licenses from making beer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that I could have made a go of it," said Dobson, who owns 
Dobson's, La Gran Tapa and the St. James Bar. "I was honestly brokenhearted 
that I couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson's dream evaporated, but he isn't the only San Diegan with suds on his 
mind. The Old Columbia Bar &amp; Grill, downtown San Diego's first 
microbrewery, opened in February, and a handful of other entrepreneurs hope to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Typically trendy San Diego is just starting to catch the national wave of 
microbreweries, companies that brew small batches of rich, full-bodied 
European-style beers and ales that make the national beer brands taste 
comparatively weak. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, an estimated 150 microbreweries already have sprung up, 
concentrated primarily in the Pacific Northwest, New England and the Great 
Lakes. In California, the number of small beer manufacturing licenses has 
rocketed to 60, up from nine in 1985. However, the majority of those licenses 
are held by brewers in Northern California, including a dozen in the Bay Area 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that everything started in Southern California," said Robert T. 
Patterson, a Los Angeles-based managing partner with the Laventhol &amp; 
Horwath accounting firm. But microbreweries are one trend that "began in the 
Pacific Northwest and percolated -- or brewed, you might say -- out from 
there," said Patterson, who tracks restaurant industry trends. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Diego's first microbrewery opened in February, when Christopher W. 
Cramer and Matthew H. Rattner opened Old Columbia Brewery &amp; Grill, a 
restaurant that offers a wide range of beers produced under the direction of 
Karl M. Strauss, a relative of Cramer's who spent 44 years as a brewer with 
Pabst Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Foote Development Co. hopes to open a restaurant and microbrewery in the 
Mission Brewery complex now under development on Washington Street near 
Interstate 5. Mission Brewing Co. produces several beers that are being sold at 
a handful of restaurants, including the San Diego Country Club and Barnetts. 
</P>
<P>
Several entrepreneurs are considering boutique breweries elsewhere in the 
county, said San Diegan Mike Zislis, president and owner of Western Brewing, 
which manufactures microbrewing systems at a plant in Tijuana. Zislis, who 
plans to open a brew-pub in Hermosa Beach in June, wants to establish a second 
brew-pub in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, whose popular Budweiser and Busch brands 
control 42% of the U. S. market, will ship about 79 million barrels of beer 
this year, a spokesman said. In contrast, Old Columbia will brew just 1,200 
barrels during its first year, and Mission Brewing Co. hopes to brew about 
4,000 barrels annually when its new plant is completed this year. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the tailor-made beer produced by the nation's growing number of 
microbreweries is drunk at on-site brew-pubs that offer both food and beer. But 
some microbreweries, including Mission Brewing Co., believe it is more 
profitable to produce beer for sale at other retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Microbrewers think there is a solid clientele for their beers that includes 
"the guy in blue jeans and work boots" as well as well-heeled yuppies, Mission 
Brewing's general manager, Bruce Kannenberg, said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides producing beer, the gleaming microbrewing systems manufactured by 
Western Brewing and other companies are important to the "brew-pub experience," 
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Brew-pub owners take care to build their restaurants around the polished and 
intricate brewing systems, so customers can watch as brewers concoct unique 
blends of hops, barley, wheat and other ingredients. Purity and freshness -- in 
addition to the unique tastes -- are the driving force behind the growing 
number of brew-pubs, Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
For longtime San Diegans, the resurgence of local brewers rekindles memories of 
the pre-Prohibition days when most cities had their own brands. During the 
early part of this century, the old Aztec Brewery in Logan Heights brewed Red 
Spot, Old Dutch, Brown Derby and Associated. The old Mission Brewery, which now 
houses the Foote project, used to brew Old Mission Lager and Hopski, a 
non-alcoholic beer. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's microbrewing revolution began in 1987 when Paul Holborn, a 
home brewer, went public by offering his beer at Bolt Brewery, a Fallbrook 
restaurant and beer bar. Holborn closed Bolt in 1988 and joined Foote, whose 
microbrewery will be built at the site of the old Mission Brewing Co., a San 
Diego-based brewery that closed in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
Zislis believes brew-pubs have spread slowly in San Diego because local 
landlords and city officials don't yet grasp the boutique brewery concept. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to put you in a commercial area," Zislis said. "When they hear 
'beer manufacturing,' they want to stick you in an area zoned for 
manufacturing." But Zislis compares a brew-pub to restaurants that offer 
on-site bakeries that "manufacture" fresh baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson predicted that brew-pubs will gain wider acceptance in Southern 
California because consumers "are looking for unique experiences when they go 
out to eat or drink." Brew-pubs offer that unique experience "because you can 
literally not get their beer anywhere else," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers generally pay more for the premium beer offered at microbreweries. A 
12-ounce glass of Old Columbia retails for $1.95. Mission Brewing, which will 
open in the spring, "is not trying to create a $3-per-six-pack kind of 
experience," Kannenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of growth, the brew-pub industry is "in its infancy . . . not unlike 
where the wine industry was 30 years ago," according to Paul Gillette, 
publisher of the Los Angeles-based California Beverage Hotline, an industry 
newsletter. Consumer awareness of wines has gradually grown over the last three 
decades, expanding the market for a wide range of new, domestically produced 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
But to be successful, a brew-pub should serve good food along with uniquely 
flavored beers and ales. 
</P>
<P>
Brewers who were familiar with Santa Monica-based City of Angels, the Los 
Angeles area's first microbrewery, described it as an attractive, upscale 
operation that produced hearty-tasting beers. It was often jammed with patrons. 
But continuing losses on the restaurant side forced City of Angels to close, 
brewers said.

DUBIOUS SAVINGS ON FRAUD CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the San Diego City Council cut the consumer fraud unit of the city 
attorney's office from nine to four staff members last summer, it looked on 
paper as if the city was saving $176,864. The money was to pay for more police 
officers, a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
But the true savings will probably be much less, and the cuts could even cost 
the city money, because civil cases of consumer fraud can generate penalties. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the past four years, more than $200,000 in penalties had been 
collected by the consumer fraud unit, including $374,000 in 1988 and $415,000 
in the first eight months of 1989. The city gets about half that, and most of 
the rest goes to the county. But even the city's share went a long way toward 
covering the expenses of the nine-member staff, and in some years it more than 
covered the salaries of those handling the civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the service a genuine consumer bargain for city residents. And, 
although it is not strictly the city's concern, the elimination of the consumer 
complaint staff also takes money out the county government's pocketbook, money 
that could well be used toward courts, jails and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are no guarantees to this form of "revenue." No one wants 
city attorneys thinking about revenue when deciding whether to take a business 
to court for allegedly fraudulent practices. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a city this size, shady business practices are probably common enough 
to make civil penalties a pretty sure bet. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the benefits to consumers, who have few other avenues for redress for 
many complaints, seem to far outweigh the financial drain on the city budget, 
even in a tight year.

ON THE BRIDGE TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Dec. 31, you carried a commentary written by the mayor of Coronado, Mary 
Herron, which dealt with the problems of the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge. I 
want you to know that the message by Mary Herron does not speak for all the 
residents of Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor talks of reducing the traffic in Coronado by the use of any mode of 
transportation except the single-occupancy auto. She also speaks of the tourist 
industry preference for discounting the present toll. What was not said was 
that, for several months, there has been a "car pool" lane on the bridge that 
allows cars with two or more persons, buses and motorcycles to cross the bridge 
without paying any toll. Therefore, most tourist traffic can use this benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Coronado residents must still make their way to the San Diego side 
in order to make their daily wage. In many cases, this involves the use of 
single-occupancy cars because car-pooling is difficult, if not impossible, to 
arrange. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that these residents are for the most part traveling in the 
opposite direction of the heaviest traffic. Yet we must pay the toll each and 
every day. It seems that the mayor is most interested in ensuring that the toll 
continue to provide bridge maintenance and for the ever-illusive alternative 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
I submit that the car-pool lane is an excellent means of moving the vast number 
of cars through the toll plaza, but is a poor way to reduce the number of cars 
on Coronado's streets. Therefore, I would propose that the car-pool lane be 
limited to the high-traffic periods (for the most part, early morning) and all 
vehicles pay a reduced toll at other times. In this manner, the monies 
necessary for bridge maintenance could be generated by all travelers, not just 
the people who cannot find another person to transport. 
</P>
<P>
I would also hope that some of the revenue generated would provide some measure 
of control of the traffic along the few streets that carry such a high 
percentage of the commuter traffic. During much of the day, it is difficult and 
dangerous to cross such streets as 3rd and 4th. I would also hope that the 
mayor would instruct the Police Department to enforce the speed limit on all 
vehicles. This would include buses and trucks. Mayor Herron observe the speed 
that some of these vehicles use on these streets. It is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The headline, "Coronado Is Still Willing to Pay the Toll" is misleading. It 
leaves the impression that Coronado wants the toll the way it is. The toll 
needs to be rethought and the residents of Coronado allowed to fully express 
themselves on the way it is applied, or, I should say, misapplied.

BROKER SAYS HE'S A VICTIM IN SLUMLORD CONVICTION; 
</P>
<P>
TENEMENT: STEPHEN REGEN SAYS HE IS A COMPASSIONATE GUY WHO CARED FOR HIS 
TENANTS. BUT HE WAS ORDERED TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR FAILING TO REPAIR 
HIS DOWNTOWN APARTMENT BUILDING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tarzana real estate broker Stephen Regen leaves his black Mercedes sedan in the 
garage and climbs into his wife's red Japanese import. His destination: Skid 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a place he would ordinarily go. 
</P>
<P>
But last October, Municipal Judge Lois Anderson Smaltz ordered Regen to spend 
60 days working at a Skid Row children's center after he failed to complete 
court-ordered repairs on his downtown Los Angeles tenement. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six weeks, Regen, a 27-year-old former New Yorker, has done his 
mandatory penance, beginning with the hourlong commute from his quiet, suburban 
street off Ventura Boulevard to the inner-city center. There, he spends the 
mornings soliciting corporate donations for the agency over the phone from a 
small, cell-like room with a barred window. 
</P>
<P>
The scene as Regen arrives on a recent morning is typical. A group of emaciated 
women are sprawled on the sidewalk sharing a needle to shoot drugs. Near the 
entrance, a man wheeling a shopping cart stumbles and adjusts his bundle. 
Later, four police cars screech by at once, their sirens interrupting Regen's 
pitch for donations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America," Regen sighed as he walked back to the parking lot after his 
daily stint ends. "No one cares what happens to these people." 
</P>
<P>
With nearly a third of his sentence completed, Regen portrays himself as a 
compassionate landlord who cared deeply about his tenants and was unfairly 
prosecuted for numerous health, fire, and building and safety violations at his 
1115 Wall St. building. He sold the apartment building in September after 
owning it for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nice guy, ask anyone, ask my tenants -- they were happy," Regen said. 
"The city attorney just didn't like me." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the point, a sympathetic friend is having a plaque made of 
newspaper clippings and documents from the case, engraved with the legend "You 
Can't Fight City Hall," Regen said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy City Atty. Richard M. Bobb said Regen was a slumlord who wound up in 
court because of serious problems at the apartment house. They ranged from 
broken windows and doors, damaged sinks and toilets to unsanitary bathrooms, 
insufficient water pressure and holes in the walls and ceilings. He said 
residents of Regen's former building complained about the conditions there to 
nuns at a nearby crisis center, who referred the case to the city's Housing 
Enforcement Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Regen is a very articulate young man, but his actions speak louder than 
his words," Bobb said. "Altogether, he had nearly a year to complete the 
court-ordered repairs and he didn't finish them. His actions show he was trying 
to make the minimum effort possible if he could get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Bobb said he urged Smaltz to sentence Regen to work on a Caltrans crew because 
he believed the hard work and indignity of picking up trash from the side of 
the freeways would teach Regen a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
But Regen asked to work at Para Los Ninos, saying he was aware of the agency 
because children in his building attended day-care, child-abuse prevention and 
other programs there. The judge agreed and also ordered Regen to contribute 
$2,500 to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he becomes more sensitized to the plight of tenants living in the 
building he owned," Smaltz said last week. "I hope they become more than just 
numbers to him and that he realizes he was personally responsible for their 
suffering in this case." 
</P>
<P>
But Regen says his renters never complained to him about conditions in the 
building, although he concedes the water pressure in at least one of the 
communal bathrooms shared by tenants was extremely low before the city's 
crackdown. The pipes in the 86-year-old building had calcified over the years, 
resulting in some faucets that trickled water even when on at full force, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you gave my tenants all the hot showers in the world, whether or not they'd 
use them, I have no idea," Regen said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're taking U.S. living standards and equating them to people whose 
standards may be different," he added, referring to the primarily Latino 
residents who live in the small, crowded one-room units in the building and use 
toilets down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if someone told me they had no hot water, we sent out a plumber," 
Regen said. "But it's hard. I didn't have the money to do the whole thing 
because I only charged about $200 a month rent. 
</P>
<P>
"The building is in the same condition for years. Then all of a sudden, after I 
had to spend $100,000 to repair the earthquake damage, the city hits you with 
all the old stuff and you're responsible," he said, referring to the 1987 
Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors, including Regen, buy downtown tenements hoping to profit from 
increasing land values there, said Barbara Zeidman, director of the rent 
stabilization division of the Los Angeles Community Development Department. But 
becoming a landlord means taking responsibility for maintenance, she said, 
adding that "it's difficult to see someone who invests voluntarily as a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
But Tanya Tull, founder and president of Para Los Ninos, said it is nearly 
impossible to adequately maintain old, decaying buildings, especially 
overcrowded single-occupancy apartments, such as the one Regen owned. "What he 
did was wrong," Tull said, "but he truly was a young, naive person who didn't 
know what he was getting into." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of where the blame lies, Para Los Ninos officials say they are 
pleased with Regen's performance and demeanor, which they say is refreshingly 
pleasant compared to that of past court-referred workers. Executive Director 
Jack J. Faz said Regen has used his business skills and contacts as a real 
estate agent to get the center crucial donations of funds, laundry soap, toys 
and sneakers. Regen is trying to find three vans to replace the agency's aging 
vehicles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a boyish quality," Faz said. "It's almost like this is his first real 
job." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Regen attended Harvard School for Boys, a private 
school in Studio City, after the family moved from Long Island to Los Angeles. 
Regen's father is a clothing manufacturer who lives in Encino, he says. Regen 
himself was a premed student at UC Berkeley who graduated with a degree in 
biology, but he decided to pursue a business career instead. 
</P>
<P>
Faz said Regen has not had to confront the harsh reality of poverty by working 
in the center's clean, cheerful environment. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what's missing," Faz said, adding that "if I had to choose between 
giving the children toys" that Regen solicited "at Christmas or hot water and 
heat, I'd choose decent living conditions." 
</P>
<P>
After finishing a shift at Para Los Ninos, Regen offers to guide reporters 
through his former building to demonstrate how good living conditions are 
there. The three-story building, just south of the city's flower district, is 
surrounded by clothing manufacturers and other garment industry businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling up to the back door, Regen jumps out and immediately points to a pipe 
that is not anchored securely to the back wall as it should be according to 
regulations. "You see," he says excitedly, "someone pulled this off the wall. 
That's a strict liability offense right there." 
</P>
<P>
Under the strict liability doctrine, if violations exist, landlords are guilty 
-- whether or not they caused the problems or even if they had been trying to 
make repairs. Some strict liability violations, such as a lack of smoke 
detectors -- which tenants often remove so they can cook illegally in their 
rooms -- threaten the safety of the entire community, prosecutor Bobb says. 
</P>
<P>
But Regen says landlords cannot be omniscient. Walking down the dimly lit 
hallway, he points to a fire hose cabinet and says he once was cited because 
tenants stole the brass fire hose nozzles to sell. "Finally, I had to spend 
$2,000 to put the locked cabinets in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the building, which Regen no longer owns, appears surprisingly 
spacious, with its wide hallways and large windows. But the tile on the floors 
of its cramped communal bathrooms is uneven and the bathtubs are moldy. After 
knocking on a few doors and finding no one home in the middle of a weekday, 
Regen gets the key from the manager and opens a couple of apartments. The 
action is a violation of city laws that require owners to give 24 hours notice 
to tenants if they plan to enter the premises. 
</P>
<P>
One room has lace curtains and a white chenille bedspread with an industrial 
sewing machine in the corner that its owner uses to do piecework. A jumble of 
clothes and bedding are crammed into another apartment, where seven people 
live, one tenant says. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosie, tell them what a good landlord I am," Regen says to a short woman 
wearing a thin white dress and cooking rice on a hot plate. "You had hot water, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes hot, sometimes not hot," the woman says. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after Regen left, a group of tenants met with Sister Kathy Wood of St. 
Francis Crisis Center to discuss current problems at the building. For them, 
regardless of who owns the building, the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
These days, it is the heaters that have broken down, prompting the city 
attorney's office to conduct a hearing with the new owners, which is only done 
in emergencies. Damp walls from leaking plumbing have caused one woman to move 
a double bed from the wall, further limiting the living space in the already 
small room. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the tenants said, the new owners have sent out notices 
saying rents will increase substantially, from about $200 to as much as $500. 
Elias Donay, one of three partners with offices in Beverly Hills who now own 
the building, said the landlords decided to charge an additional $50 for each 
person who resides there above the legally allowable limit of three people per 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The rent hike is illegal, city official Zeidman said. At most, the new owners 
could charge 20% of the current legal rent for each additional person. And to 
do so, they would have to make the difficult case that there is no way they 
could have known how many people lived there when they bought it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Regen, who apparently consults frequently with the new owners, said the rent 
hike has been rescinded on his advice. To him, the incident demonstrates whose 
side he is on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a story about a young guy who got into a situation," he said, "where 
if the city didn't get on his rear, everyone would be happy, including the 
tenants."

REPORT OF GAPS IN PROTECTION LAYER SPURS REVIEW OF WATER POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worried that South Bay water supplies may be more vulnerable to pollution than 
previously believed, local, state and federal officials are launching a broad 
assessment of underground water contamination in the region. 
</P>
<P>
A federal report completed in June suggests that there may be major gaps in a 
natural underground layer of silt and clay that was presumed to prevent 
pollutants from reaching the deep aquifers that provide most of the drinking 
water in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In response, officials from a range of government agencies are pooling 
geologic, hydrologic and pollution test data and evaluating it jointly to 
determine whether to accelerate ground-water cleanup efforts in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Participants -- including officials from the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency, the state Department of Health Services and the Regional Water Quality 
Control Board -- hope to complete an initial assessment by May. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this new information is important, but feel we have to confirm it," 
said Julia Bussey, a hazardous materials specialist with the state Department 
of Health Services. "If it turns out to be correct, then we would have 
significant cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
Prompting the interagency action is an EPA report dated June 30 based on 
evidence from monitoring wells drilled within a two-mile radius of a former 
rubber manufacturing complex north of Del Amo Boulevard, between Vermont and 
Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
A test well near Torrance High School revealed a break in a thick layer of silt 
and clay that separates the near-surface Gage aquifer from the Lynwood and 
Silverado aquifers, from which most South Bay drinking water is drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that although no South Bay drinking water wells have been 
contaminated, they consider the EPA study disturbing on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
For one, it showed that pollutants that seeped from disposal pits at the World 
War II-era rubber complex have a relatively clear path to the deep aquifers, 
located about 200 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, started under U.S. government contract by Shell Oil, Dow Chemical 
Co., U.S. Rubber, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber and Firestone in 1942, leaked 
contaminants that include cancer-causing benzene, toluene and xylene, according 
to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how far underground the pollutants have traveled, officials 
said. But in view of the new information on geology in the area, the so-called 
Del Amo site -- now being investigated by the state -- may be placed on the 
federal Superfund list of priority cleanup projects, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other nearby sources of potential ground-water pollution will have 
to be reexamined soon for leaks, the officials said. Among them is the Torrance 
landfill. Paul La Courreye, EPA manager of the Del Amo site study, said that if 
Torrance's former dump were located above a solid aquitard -- the name for the 
silt and clay layer -- there would be far less urgency in checking it for 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Torrance landfill is a well-done landfill," La Courreye said, referring to 
the anti-pollution steps taken when the dump was closed. "But it's in the wrong 
place." 
</P>
<P>
A broader worry raised by the new EPA study is the possibility that the clay 
and silt layer underlying the South Bay's upper aquifer may be absent elsewhere 
in the region, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Shallow ground-water contamination from polluters ranging from dry cleaners to 
oil refineries is already extensive in the South Bay. And some industrial 
contaminants already have entered the upper aquifer, mostly near oil 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have long believed that the aquitard was continuous throughout the 
region, a solid barrier preventing pollutants from fouling the deep aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
"This investigation kind of blows a hole in that theory," La Courreye said. "It 
indicated that the safety net we thought was there may not exist." 
</P>
<P>
J. T. Liu, an engineer with the Regional Water Quality Control Board, said: "It 
wasn't good news at all. . . . It is kind of a warning to us." 
</P>
<P>
It is this potential for a larger water contamination problem that prompted the 
interagency group to begin its comprehensive assessment of the South Bay's 
underground pollution, officials said. Led by the state Department of Health 
Services, the group began meeting in August. 
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the study, information on hydrology, geology and 
underground pollution will be pooled and used to develop a computer model that 
can gauge the risk to the South Bay's deep aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
Although new testing may have to be performed, individual agencies have 
accumulated a great deal of important data already as part of their routine 
regulatory work, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the information turned up so far, for instance, is evidence of another 
gap in the aquitard detected in Carson near the point where Sepulveda Boulevard 
crosses the Dominguez Channel, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Contained in apparently overlooked test well data at the Regional Water Board, 
the evidence is potentially significant because three refineries and a tank 
farm are located near the Carson test well site. 
</P>
<P>
Bussey said she could not say when the interagency group will be able to 
determine whether more cleanup efforts are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup work usually involves the extraction and treatment of tainted water 
from shallow ground-water basins or aquifers, and the treatment or removal of 
contaminated soil. 
</P>
<P>
Officials pointed out that they are already pursuing such projects vigorously 
at numerous hazardous waste sites in the South Bay. But the recent EPA report, 
they acknowledged, has created a new climate. 
</P>
<P>
La Courreye, speaking from his office in San Francisco, said: "It has made the 
level of urgency go up for all agencies with any doings down there." 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-SECTION OF TORRANCE STUDY AREA 
</P>
<P>
EPA tests conducted in Torrance recently revealed a gap in the natural silt and 
clay layer separating the near-surface Gage aquifer and two deeper aquifers, 
the Silverado and Lynwood, from which most of the South Bay's drinking water is 
drawn. Experts say the finding is worrisome because it indicates that the clay 
and silt layer, called an aquitard, may not be as effective as they assumed in 
shielding the deep aquifers from underground pollution.

Water supply -- A story in the Jan. 14 South Bay Edition said incorrectly that 
most of the South Bay's drinking water is drawn from local aquifers. According 
to the West Basin Municipal Water District, wells provide about a quarter of 
the South Bay's drinking water. The rest is drawn from water supplies diverted 
to the Los Angeles area from Northern California and the Colorado River.

FREE SPEECH, ANARCHY AT ISSUE IN GADFLY WAR; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BURBANK OFFICIALS BELIEVE A NOVEL TACTIC WILL PERSUADE CRITICS TO 
SPEAK LESS AT COUNCIL MEETINGS. THE CRITICS ARE UNPERSUADED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is after midnight on a recent Tuesday. A handful of community activists -- 
who have waited all night to address the City Council -- saunters up to the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members, slouched in their chairs and looking bored, do not 
even acknowledge the first man at the microphone. One councilman checks his 
watch, another yawns helplessly, as the speaker launches into yet another 
tirade against alleged widespread corruption in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Just another typical Burbank City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hounded and harassed by gadflies for years, the Burbank City Council has tried 
numerous times to restrict public comment on non-agenda topics in an effort to 
discourage verbal attacks and to shorten its seemingly endless meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the council have repeatedly cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bill of Rights supersedes the petty whims of council people," said Jules 
Kimmett, gadfly par excellence and the only member of a group he calls 
Concerned Citizens of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking the podium often invoke the Constitution when they defend their 
right to speak at council meetings. But state officials and legal experts say 
the "right to free speech" at public meetings is a complicated legal issue and 
can, in fact, be limited by local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 amendment to the Ralph M. Brown Act, the state's open-meeting law, 
requires all local government agencies to set aside time for public comment on 
any topic. But, Deputy Atty. Gen. Ted Prim said, the law also provides those 
agencies with the authority to provide "reasonable limits" on the amount of 
time an individual can speak on agenda and non-agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Burbank council backed off from a more stringent limitation and 
instead voted not to televise the second portion of "oral communications," 
hoping that would discourage some of the rambling discourses. During this 
comment period, at the end of each meeting, speakers are allowed to address the 
council on any topic they choose. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be responsible to the voters and deal with the business of the 
city," Mayor Robert R. Bowne said in defending the council's action to limit 
television coverage of its meetings. "What has happened is the direct result of 
the conduct by 10 or 12 individuals who continually violate the rules of order. 
I'm not going to allow important business of the city to be taken over by a 
small group of people bent on anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
Ted McConkey, a member of the Burbank Rancho homeowners group and an outspoken 
critic of the City Council, disagreed, saying that better decisions are made 
when the public is allowed to speak and be heard on important issues facing the 
city. "The whole thing was silly," McConkey said of the council's ruling. 
"Obviously, they don't like the legitimate comments of the speakers. It's not a 
question of unfair criticism, but not allowing the public at home to judge for 
themselves. The real losers are the people of Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Burbank has its share of people who regularly attend City Council 
meetings and harangue council members and city staff. In addition to Kimmett, 
who regularly campaigns to recall all five council members, there is Melvin 
Perlitsh, a longtime critic who has as much trouble sticking to the subject at 
hand as he has adhering to the five-minute speaking limit; and S. Michael 
Stavropoulos, a neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Burbank 
Board of Education last year and now spends most of his time at council 
meetings denouncing the board. 
</P>
<P>
All three have been forcibly removed from City Council meetings on numerous 
occasions for speaking out of order, and both Kimmett and Perlitsh have been 
arrested for carrying on at school board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth has a way of irritating people," Kimmett said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 amendment to the Brown Act is designed to balance the right of the 
people to address their elected officials with the need of a government body to 
get its work done, Prim said. But the problem, according to Prim, is that 
reasonable limits can be interpreted in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, following its own 
interpretation of the Brown Act in 1987, voted to limit the number of times 
that an individual may address the supervisors on any topic he chooses. Instead 
of once a week, a person is now allowed to testify before the board only once 
every 90 days on non-agenda topics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, no more than five people may address the board on non-agenda items 
in any single meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it works pretty well," County Counsel D.W. Clinton said. "You can 
draw your own conclusions as to why we did it." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, the Los Angeles Board of Education last week voted to 
limit the amount of time board members can comment on issues to five minutes 
per subject in an attempt to shorten their often lengthy meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Given the provisions of the Brown Act, there are various options that cities 
have employed to limit public comment on topics on and off the agenda. Some 
cities limit comment to five minutes, others to three minutes. Some 
municipalities put the public comment period on non-agenda topics at the 
beginning of the meeting; others, such as Burbank, put it at the end. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank speakers are allowed to address the council for five minutes at the 
beginning of each meeting on agenda topics, and three minutes at the end of 
each meeting on any topic they choose. But the number of speakers is not 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
Not all government agencies, however, have had to confront the problem. City 
officials in Glendale, Thousand Oaks and even Los Angeles all say that their 
meetings run pretty smoothly and that they have not felt the need to limit 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Really we don't have that kind of problem," said Los Angeles Senior Assistant 
City Atty. George Buchannan, who advises the Los Angeles City Council. "Sure we 
have people that stand up and beat the drums and look at the television 
cameras, but they don't really get belligerent. This council, which has 15 
members, is pretty patient with people. I've been here 19 years and I've never 
seen them turn anybody off." 
</P>
<P>
The allusion to television cameras is not accidental; when the camera starts 
rolling, existing problems seem to intensify. Bowne said that since the Burbank 
council began televising its meetings on cable two years ago the gadfly problem 
has grown worse. 
</P>
<P>
And that was the reason Bowne and two other council members voted to limit 
coverage of the council's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Tim Murphy, who voted against the measure, said the council 
should not try to decide what is appropriate for the viewer to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel uncomfortable being associated with censorship," Murphy said. "It seems 
it would be easier for the viewer, if he is offended, to turn it off, than for 
the government to take action and pull the plug." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Mayor Donna Smith, whose city is also known for boisterous public 
debate, agreed with Bowne that television has probably added to the problem of 
attracting gadflies. Pomona began broadcasting its meetings on community cable 
television two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike Bowne, Smith thinks that the public would not want the city of 
Pomona to tamper with television coverage of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"It has its pros and cons, but the main thing is we have an informed 
community," Smith said. "I really don't think the community would allow or want 
the City Council to pull the plug on any portion of it. It's just too popular 
here. It's the hottest thing going. I think it's better watched than 'Monday 
Night Football.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Bowne said he is confident that the council's decision "is a step in the 
right direction toward conducting City Council meetings in an appropriate 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to change the image of our city," Bowne said. "I don't think we want to 
have our city meetings viewed as some form of cheap entertainment. I really 
feel we're doing the right thing here." 
</P>

Stanley Adamakis took St. Cross Episcopal Church by storm. 
</P>
<P>
The dark, bearded Greek Orthodox priest, who arrived at the Hermosa Beach 
church a little more than a year ago, first fascinated and then repelled a 
congregation accustomed to quiet sermons and muted passions. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Stan" was big and blustery and, at times, a lot of fun, parishioners 
said last week. To hear Adamakis talk -- in a Boston accent as flat as St. 
Cross's marble altar -- he had hobnobbed with rock stars, performed the 
marriage of one of the world's wealthiest men and been promised a White House 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers in the church youth group called his monologues "The Tidal Wave." 
Adamakis talked so fast, they said, that you could never pin him down on a 
single topic. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents thought it odd that a Greek Orthodox priest had adopted an 
Episcopal church. But they were comforted by the thought that Adamakis was an 
old friend of Father Richard Wescott, the church's second-ranking priest. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after Adamakis, 47, was arrested late last month for allegedly 
molesting an young man, 18, connected to the church youth group that a 
different picture began to emerge. Parishioners read news accounts that the 
portly, 6-foot priest was a convicted child molester on the verge of being 
defrocked by the Greek Orthodox Church. He had lost two jobs because of 
allegations of sexual misbehavior. Then a second teen-ager, this one a 
17-year-old boy who was a member of the youth group, went to police with 
similar charges about an incident in August. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis and his lawyer have declined to comment about the two teen-agers' 
separate claims that he visited and drank beer with the teen-agers while 
chaperoning them at parishioners' homes. The charges allege that he fondled 
them after they went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
He will be arraigned on two felony molestation charges Jan. 23 in South Bay 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Cross youth group and parents met last week with a psychologist to work 
out feelings of anger and betrayal. They also shared "Stanley stories" with the 
bemused resignation of those who have been fooled. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say?" said Father Jack D. Eales, St. Cross' rector. "This is one 
of the most charming, delightful people you could want to meet." 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis came to St. Cross in September of 1988, moving into Wescott's parish 
home next to the church on Monterey Boulevard. The two priests had become 
friends when they worked together in the early 1980s at a psychiatric and drug 
rehabilitation center in the San Fernando Valley. Wescott said in an interview 
that he offered Adamakis a home because he was out of work and could not pay 
the rent on his San Fernando Valley apartment. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 church bulletin, announcing that Adamakis would be a guest speaker at 
St. Cross, described him as a graduate of the Episcopal Theological School in 
Cambridge, Mass., who was completing a doctorate in "nonprofit corporate law" 
at USC. It described him as a Greek Orthodox priest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Adamakis never graduated from the theological school and USC does not 
offer such a degree in law, officials at the two schools said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis did earn a bachelor of theology degree in 1966 from Holy Cross Greek 
Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., and was ordained a priest. But 
more than a year ago, he was banned from ministering at Greek Orthodox churches 
because of repeated, but never substantiated, allegations of sexual 
misbehavior, said a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kicked out of the church," said spokesman Takis Gazouleas. "He is no 
longer a member of our clergy." 
</P>
<P>
Formal defrockment proceedings were postponed while Adamakis underwent 
counseling but are expected to resume because of the new allegations, Gazouleas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis' questionable claims extended beyond the listing in the church 
bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers and adults talked about Adamakis' brazenness almost with fascination 
at the recent counseling session. They shared "Stanley stories" and anecdotes 
about tales Adamakis had told them: He was a major fund-raiser in Gov. Michael 
Dukakis' bid for the presidency, and Dukakis had offered to make him the White 
House priest. He knew Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis and presided at 
one of the billionaire's weddings. He conducted a funeral Mass for actress 
Natalie Wood. 
</P>
<P>
A Dukakis spokesman said the governor had never heard of Adamakis, and news 
clippings on Onassis and Wood do not mention the priest. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, we all questioned the stories at some point in time," said one 
woman, at the meeting. "But then we just glossed it over." 
</P>
<P>
It was "glossed over" mostly because "Father Stan" was a hit in the youth 
group, which had been reinstituted last August by Wescott. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a barrel of fun," Wescott said. "He was like a big adolescent." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the teen-agers said Adamakis had a way of talking to them that boosted 
their confidence. He told one boy that his play on the high school football 
team would improve. He showed another how to fix a stereo. No matter what topic 
they were interested in, he seemed to know all about it. 
</P>
<P>
But there were incongruities, too. The teen-agers recalled: 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis showed much more interest in the boys than in the girls. They had 
never met a priest who liked heavy metal music. And several boys said Adamakis 
asked them if they were gay. 
</P>
<P>
Others told police that they would brush aside such questions by saying, "No 
Father Stan, I'm not that way." 
</P>
<P>
"If all the parents could have put together all the isolated anecdotes," one 
mother said, "maybe they could have done more." 
</P>
<P>
Wescott resigned last Tuesday, accepting blame for bringing Adamakis into the 
parish, but said he knew nothing of his fellow priest's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis served 78 days in jail and was placed on five years probation in 1986, 
after pleading guilty to molesting two Torrance brothers, ages 12 and 13. He 
had been forced to resign as director of the South Bay Free Clinic in 1981 
after two boys in the clinic's teen-advocate program said Adamakis had "come on 
to them," the clinic's former administrator said. According to a probation 
report, Adamakis was forced to leave another job, in which he worked with 
abused children, after his unnamed employer learned that he had been arrested 
for molesting the Torrance boys. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the church vestry said that in the future they will check the 
criminal records of all employees and volunteers who want to work with youths. 
</P>
<P>
"We are teaching loving Christian values," said Graham Lewis, the psychologist 
who met with the youth group. "But we also have to keep our guard up."

CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CHARGES FILED AGAINST EL SEGUNDO COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten conflict-of-interest charges have been filed against El Segundo Councilman 
H. R. (Bob) Anderson by fellow Councilman Scot D. Dannen, who alleges that 
Anderson improperly voted or discussed matters affecting Chevron U.S.A. and its 
oil refinery while owning 6,600 shares of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 charges were filed Thursday with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. Dannen claims Anderson has "willingly and knowingly broken the law" 
by participating in decisions that applied only to Chevron and in decisions 
that affected various businesses in the city, including Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Dannen said the alleged conflict has opened to legal challenge the council's 
decisions on matters dating back to May, 1988. They include city business 
license fees, a building inspection program, a utility users tax and a 
subdivision of Chevron land, according to documents filed with the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he has done nothing improper and labeled Dannen's action a 
political attack. Anderson said he has yet to decide whether to seek reelection 
when his term expires in April. Chevron, which founded El Segundo nearly 80 
years ago as a refinery town, is a major landowner and taxpayer in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Though Dannen said he wants to improve ethics in city politics, he also said he 
would like to see Anderson off the council because Anderson is biased toward 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson denied having such a bias, though he stated that local businesses are 
overtaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Alan West has sided with Anderson, but Councilman Jim Clutter said 
Dannen has raised a valid issue concerning the possible legal jeopardy created 
for the city by Anderson's alleged conflict. Mayor Carl Jacobson declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dannen said he knows of no one considering a challenge to city actions based on 
the possible conflict. 
</P>
<P>
FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku confirmed Dannen's filing on Thursday and said 
it will be reviewed to determine whether a violation may have occurred. State 
law requires a public official to refrain from "participating in or making 
governmental decisions which could materially affect the financial interest of 
the official," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who was a Chevron employee for 36 years until he retired as a 
maintenance superintendent in 1983, said he acquired his Chevron common stock 
through an employee stock purchase plan. The value of the stock is about 
$445,000. He said his ownership is insignificant in comparison to the more than 
342 million outstanding Chevron shares. 
</P>
<P>
Dannen said the conflict filing was sparked at a Dec. 20 closed council session 
in which Anderson discussed the extent of his Chevron holdings. Although 
Anderson said his financial interest statement filed with the city lists 
ownership of Chevron stock valued in excess of $100,000, Dannen -- as well as 
Jacobson and Clutter -- said they did not know of the amount until the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In the open council meeting that followed the closed session, Anderson 
abstained when the council adopted a building ordinance that eliminated a city 
inspector program in which employees of large companies -- including Chevron -- 
were deputized to do certain city inspections on company property. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, however, participated in the 5-0 vote at that meeting to change 
language in the terms of deed for land along Sepulveda Boulevard that Chevron 
had donated to the city in 1988. The 25 acres included a golf course and 
contained deed restrictions limiting its use. It was valued between $12 and $15 
million at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The action removed land-use rights retained by Chevron that the company felt 
could interfere with its receiving a tax deduction for the gift. At the same 
time, it gave the city more flexibility in developing the land. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he abstained on the Building Code vote on the advice of City 
Atty. Leland Dolley because elimination of deputy inspectors could cost Chevron 
substantial amounts of money in inspection delays. But he said he voted on the 
Sepulveda land lease changes because the city, not Chevron, benefited. He said 
the land was a donation and the city now will be able "to develop the property 
to the fullest extent." 
</P>
<P>
Dannen, however, asserts that Chevron will receive a "considerable tax 
advantage" from the vote. He charged Anderson with voting to help Chevron and 
to protect his stock investment. 
</P>
<P>
Dolley declined to comment on any of the advice he gave the council as city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anderson said he does not believe his votes have been improper, he 
said: "If I'm at fault, I take the responsibility." He said that in the future, 
he will vote "on nothing affecting Chevron."

SUN WILL BREAK THROUGH BUT WET IS THE WATCHWORD 
</P>

<P>
The on-again, off-again showers and cool, breezy conditions that hit San Diego 
early Saturday will continue through the morning, a National Weather Service 
forecaster said. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front off the Southern California coast has been joined by an 
upper-level disturbance, which will extend the wet weather through today. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the two of them, the unstable air and shower activity will keep up 
through noon," forecaster Harvey Hastrup said. "We had some showers (Saturday) 
and we are expected to get more." 
</P>
<P>
The rainfall in most areas remained well under an inch during the day Saturday, 
with Palomar Mountain receiving 0.75 and Santee 0.41. But only 0.05 inch of 
rain fell in Imperial Beach and San Diego averaged 0.11. 
</P>
<P>
More rain was expected last night and this morning. The coastal and inland 
areas may receive up to an additional inch of rain by mid-morning, when showers 
should begin decreasing. The overcast skies will then slowly break, becoming 
partly cloudy by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Hastrup said the showers are likely to linger throughout the day in the 
mountains, where 1 to 3 inches of rain are expected. The National Weather 
Service has also issued a snow advisory down to the 5,000-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, mountain winds will gust up to 30 m.p.h. in the mountains, with a 
few isolated blasts a tad harder. Wind flurries on the coastal strip and inland 
regions will pick up to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the skies will remain partly cloudy for the Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. holiday, but Hastrup said the rainy pattern may return as early as Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out of the woods yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Activity in the Pacific Northwest will likely bring rain, he said, because the 
high pressure system will not be strong enough to dissipate the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Showers and cloudy, breezy conditions are forecast for Wednesday and Thursday. 
High temperatures for the beaches through Monday will remain at 57 to 61 
degrees, with some showers and a few thunderstorms this morning and gusty 
southerly winds up to 20 m.p.h. Daytime temperatures along the coast and inland 
valleys will range from 60 to 67 degrees through Monday. Coastal lows will fall 
to 48 to 54; inland 42 to 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain temperatures remain brisk, with highs of 38 to 45 degrees and lows of 
25 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
The desert areas will have variable cloudiness with a slight chance of showers, 
with highs of 60 to 68, and lows of 42 to 52 through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 4 to 6 feet at 12-second intervals with water temperature near 58 
degrees.

RELATIVES OF DEAD INMATE DROP LAWSUIT AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Relatives of a construction worker who was found hanged in his Torrance jail 
cell in 1988 have dropped their highly publicized lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Paper work requesting dismissal of the case was filed in Torrance Superior 
Court on Wednesday, ending a lengthy battle by 27-year-old Timothy McCauley's 
family to prove that he did not commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the dismissal came after the city agreed not to 
seek legal costs from the family. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they realized there really was no case there," Nelson said. "There is 
a sense of relief on our part. We're cleaning up some of these high-visibility 
cases against the city that, like this one, didn't have any real significance." 
</P>
<P>
McCauley's father, Donald, insisted in a brief telephone interview that the 
case did have merit, but declined to comment on why he had decided not to 
pursue it any further. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the case was filed in October, 1988, the Police Department was 
facing a barrage of brutality accusations, ranging from the alleged cover-up of 
an accidental shooting of a motorcyclist to a videotape showing officers 
beating a young party-goer. 
</P>
<P>
The McCauley case began late Aug. 10, 1988, when a police officer tried to stop 
McCauley for speeding. McCauley allegedly tried to run over the officer and 
then fled, crashing several blocks away after a high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors gave McCauley a sling for a sprained shoulder and then released him to 
Torrance police, who placed him in a one-man jail cell. Shortly after noon on 
Aug. 11, McCauley was found dead with the shoulder sling around his neck, 
hanging from a grate in the cell's ceiling.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TIP LEADS TO 44 ARRESTS AT SYLMAR COCKFIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested 44 men and seized 50 gamecocks at a cockfight in 
Sylmar Saturday afternoon after receiving an anonymous phone tip, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal fights were being staged in an arena in the back yard of a 
residence in the 12500 block of Bradley Avenue, said Sgt. Bill Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
The house's owner, Juan Duenas, 46, was cited for possession of fighting cocks, 
Sgt. Sol Polen said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men were given misdemeanor citations for being at a cockfight and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The birds were taken to an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
If authorities identify the birds' owners, the owners can be charged with 
cruelty to animals, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also confiscated scales used to weigh the birds before a match, and the 
razors that are attached to the birds' legs during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
One of the birds had injuries from a previous fight, Polen said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that cockfighting, a sport imported from Mexico, occurs 
regularly in the primarily Latino areas of the northeast Valley, but officials 
say that raids are rare because the fights are usually clandestine and promoted 
only by word-of-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The matches are usually between birds of equal weight. 
</P>
<P>
The birds' handlers, usually the owners, taunt the two birds by holding them 
beak-to-beak. 
</P>
<P>
Then the birds are dropped and the fight begins. A match usually lasts only a 
minute or so before one of the birds quits or is fatally slashed by the razors 
attached to the opponent's legs with electrical tape.

COSTA MESA CAN SHOW IT REALLY HAS A HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa City Council has an opportunity Monday to salvage the city's 
reputation as a community with a heart. It should rescind its decision to evict 
the Share Our Selves charity from a community center until a new location can 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
SOS plans to ask for a 2- to 3-month extension on its lease to give it time to 
negotiate purchase of a new site, an action made possible only last week by the 
generous outpouring of donations that have come in the wake of publicity over 
SOS's plight. The council majority, responding to neighborhood complaints about 
SOS, ordered the charity to move its food, clothing and financial assistance 
operations. Although the city offered to help SOS find another location, it 
balked when faced with the cost of helping it move to an industrial building 
the city had located. SOS's fate hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
But pressure has continued to build on the council, with Orange County 
religious leaders jumping into the fray. Summing up the matter, Father Michael 
P. Driscoll, the vicar of charities for the Diocese of Orange, said, "It 
strikes me that if Jesus lived today, the city of Costa Mesa would find him 
undesirable." Meanwhile, SOS supporters vowed to fast this weekend and Monday 
to try to get the council to reconsider its order to start eviction proceedings 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mayor Peter F. Buffa made a new proposal to move SOS to Community 
Development Council offices in another part of town, well away from residential 
areas. Whether or not Buffa has the two votes needed to win approval of his 
plan is unclear at this time; it calls for the city to subsidize the lease by 
$177,658 over five years, with SOS paying slightly less. 
</P>
<P>
While that would be money well spent, the city should instead give SOS an 
extension on its current lease to give the charity the time needed to purchase 
its own building. This would not only relieve the city of financial 
responsibility but give SOS the autonomy it needs. The latter is important 
because there are City Council members who want to exclude illegal aliens from 
receiving SOS services, a restriction that cannot be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
Two council members who voted against SOS in the past have accused the charity 
of dragging its feet and playing politics in order to get its way. Frankly, 
it's good to see SOS employing political pressure to save itself. We only hope 
it is not too late.

BUS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pursuant to the article indicating the siting of a new Orange County Transit 
District bus station at Fashion Island, I write to express my strongest 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
As a commuter traveling the San Joaquin Hills Road/MacArthur (Boulevard) 
junction daily, I find it congested. To place 12 buses in and out of that 
junction on a daily basis is absurd traffic planning. 
</P>
<P>
This represents a safety hazard that will clog MacArthur, and the bus turning 
will increase pedestrian and vehicular accidents at that junction. I speak from 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
My wife was nearly killed in a severe auto accident three years ago at the 
MacArthur/San Joaquin junction.

SATISFIED PATIENT DEFENDS ALLERGIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re articles on Dr. George R. Borrell (Jan. 4 and 6): About 10 years ago, after 
many years of misery with frequent colds and flu, blocked nose, having to sit 
up all night, I went to a qualified MD allergist. I was given the 200-plus skin 
test injections, was told that I was allergic to practically everything in the 
air and put on a twice-a-week allergy injection program. 
</P>
<P>
After some months with no improvement, I was informed that the only solution 
was to have an operation, in fact two operations, one for each side of my face 
(sinuses). The doctor told me his fee for each operation was $2,000, and so 
with the hospital costs plus one month off work, I was facing considerable cost 
and suffering. There was no assurance that it would cure the problem or that it 
would not recur. 
</P>
<P>
Then I remembered an advertisement about allergy control. I went to see Dr. 
Borrell, at that time in Gardena. He described the immune system, the allergy 
control treatment, the history behind it, how he had found out about it and 
researched it. He did not claim a cure-all but stated that he had a better than 
80% success rate. He also cautioned that I probably would not see any change 
until after at least the fourth injection. The cost was $100 for the first 
visit and $35 for each of the following seven weekly injections. 
</P>
<P>
After the fifth injection, I began to notice improvement and after the eighth 
and final injection, I felt fine. Since then, I have not had any allergy 
problems. It would be a great disservice to the many thousands of Dr. Borrell's 
patients and even greater injustice to revoke his license due to the complaints 
of three persons.

THE IRVINE CO.'S PLAN FOR A BIGGER EAST ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the East Orange petition drive: I applaud Dottie Thrdecek, Terri Sargeant, 
Sharon Seibert and everyone else who is working to see that all city of Orange 
residents have a chance to vote on the future of their city and the quality of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that all Orange County residents will not have the chance to 
vote on the East Orange development and others like it. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,350 homes, 347,000 additional daily car trips, destruction of natural 
open space and wildlife habitat, crushing gridlock and unhealthful air will 
affect everyone who lives in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the tens of thousands of homes planned and under construction in 
Orange and Riverside counties, the three new freeways and proposed private toll 
roads, paid for by fees on more development, and we are looking at the last of 
Orange County as we now know it. That may make the Irvine Co. fatter and 
happier, but it will leave you and me in the middle of paradise lost.

NEW YEAR'S BIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I read the article about Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. and his timed 
delivery of Myra Palmer, I was compelled to write. The gray areas of obstetrics 
I leave to the obstetricians and the lawyers to debate. 
</P>
<P>
I am not an obstetrics nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The part of this story that bothered me had to do with Dr. Turner's belief that 
God was working through him, helping him achieve this birth for the television 
event. I am certain that he believes this to be true and that he believes he 
did the right thing. What I am also certain of is mankind's track record of 
committing atrocities in the name of God, all the while believing that they too 
were doing the right thing. We all need to be aware of this, no matter what our 
religion, or belief system. 
</P>
<P>
When we are swayed by our religious leaders into having a baby for TV, paying 
for an air-conditioned dog house, or giving money so that God won't "call our 
minister," we are putting our faith in leaders whose actions, at best, are 
questionable. May we all wake up and smell the coffee.

INFANT FORMULA FOR NEW BABY -- IDEAL GIFT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It never ceases to amaze me that infant formula is still considered to be an 
ideal gift for a new baby. I am referring to your article (Jan. 1) regarding 
the New Year's baby born at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
In light of all the research about breast milk being the far superior infant 
food, I cannot believe that hospitals still insist on being free advertisements 
for the formula companies! The money used to buy the New Year's baby four 
weeks' worth of formula could have been much better spent on the services of a 
lactation consultant for the new mother. 
</P>
<P>
At least this type of gift would have proven the giver's true interest in the 
well-being of that baby! 
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough for the hospitals to give away free formula but is even worse 
for the newspapers to announce this as if it were such a great gift. How 
unfortunate that our culture continues to undermine the superb benefits that 
human milk offers to both mother and baby.

NEW YEAR'S BIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Jim Carlton's article, "Pastor Lashes Out at Media" (Jan. 5), I was 
very disappointed in Pastor Ralph Wilkerson's and Dr. Charles Wesley Turner 
Jr.'s failure to recognize the legitimate grievances expressed by the media 
concerning their actions. 
</P>
<P>
It's bad enough to make a public media and congregational spectacle out of one 
of God's greatest miracles -- the birth of a baby. 
</P>
<P>
But to threaten the health of the child, and then deny the planning or the 
threat, is inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
To blatantly deny that it was so planned many months ago, as the quotations The 
Times' articles clearly indicate, shows a very serious failing. Wilkerson is 
quoted as saying, "There was absolutely no danger to the baby, and I don't care 
what anybody says." Does Wilkerson really believe that his position as a pastor 
also makes him a medical expert?

ASSEMBLY LINE FLEXIBILITY SETS JAPANESE APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HIROSHIMA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masami Ishihara, the man in charge of building what is arguably the hottest car 
in the Western world, is about to beat a headache that has been bugging him for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of headache that his counterparts in Detroit would dearly love to 
have. 
</P>
<P>
For here in Hiroshima, Ishihara is the boss of Assembly Line No. 5 inside 
Mazda's giant U-1 plant, and that means that he is responsible for building 
Mazda's Miata two-seat convertible, the automobile that has evoked a kind of 
visceral lust among millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The public clamoring for the cute little roadster has reached absurd heights -- 
which brings us back to Ishihara's quandary. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Miata was introduced last spring, Ishihara has been frustrated -- he 
has been able to build only about 20,000 of them, and demand has so far 
outstripped supply that Mazda's American dealers have been eagerly gouging 
their customers with astronomical sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
Miata production has been severely restricted because the car must share space 
on its assembly line with Mazda's 323, 929 and RX7 models, all of which are big 
sellers. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Ishihara has figured out how to triple Miata production for 1990: He 
plans to shift production of Mazda's 323 subcompacts to another nearby line 
inside the same factory. That should free up more space for the Miata, enabling 
Mazda to build 60,000 this year -- including 40,000 earmarked for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
So, though it has taken a while, Mazda will thus catch up with its customers 
long before they start to lose interest in the Miata. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get a hot car, we can accommodate demand," Ishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
And Ishihara has Mazda's remarkably flexible approach to manufacturing to thank 
for that. 
</P>
<P>
Not only can Mazda build four, five or even six different cars on the same 
assembly line, it can also have two or three of those complicated lines running 
inside the same factory. Without sacrificing quality. 
</P>
<P>
That is unheard of in Detroit, yet it is commonplace in Japan, where the 
scarcity of available land long ago forced manufacturers to find ways to 
consolidate their operations. For Japan, that flexibility played a critical 
role in helping its auto industry retain its competitive edge over America's 
Big Three throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
It has also helped the Japanese adapt more readily to changes in the 
marketplace -- and provided them with a way to produce a wider assortment of 
new cars much more cheaply than is possible in Detroit. With the ability to 
plug new models into existing assembly lines, the Japanese can often avoid the 
prohibitively high costs of building new plants. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, for instance, created its Infiniti line of luxury cars for only about 
$500 million -- much more cheaply than American observers thought possible. It 
saved money by building the Infiniti Q-45 at an existing assembly plant in 
Tochigi, Japan, sharing an assembly line with the Nissan Cedric and Nissan 
Cima, luxury cars sold only in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi is following the same course with its new 1991 3000GT, which will be 
introduced next fall. The sleek, 300-horsepower sports car will be built at 
Mitsubishi's assembly plant in Nagoya, which also produces pickup trucks and 
the company's Sigma sedan. By thus holding down manufacturing costs, Mitsubishi 
will be able to offer the 3000GT for just $31,000, far less than comparable 
European and American sports cars. General Motors, by contrast, has gone in the 
opposite direction as it has tried to compete with the Japanese. GM has 
reportedly spent more than $3 billion on its new Saturn car, with much of that 
money going for a new manufacturing complex in Tennessee that will be dedicated 
exclusively to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
Few Big Three plants, in fact, are capable of producing more than one or two 
different cars on the same line, unless they are nearly identical models hiding 
behind different nameplates. Ford's Wixom, Mich., luxury car factory builds 
just three models -- the Lincoln Continental, Lincoln Town Car and the 
Continental Mark VII -- yet it is still the most flexible plant in the domestic 
industry. It is the only Big Three assembly plant that can build both 
front-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive cars on the same line. 
</P>
<P>
By doing so much mixing and matching on their assembly lines, the Japanese are 
better able than Detroit to adapt to wild swings in consumer tastes. Unlike the 
U.S. Big Three, the Japanese do not have to shut down an entire plant just 
because the sales of one car line tail off, and that helps them live up to 
their no-layoff guarantees to workers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you build a plant for each model, you have problems when sales go down," 
Ishihara said. "Our system is much more cost-efficient." 
</P>
<P>
By concentrating their production, the Japanese can also get by with far fewer 
assembly plants than can the U.S. auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Honda, for example, has just two assembly plants in all of Japan, producing 
more than 1.3 million cars between them. Honda's Suzuka plant, the largest in 
Japan, produces more than 800,000 cars a year on three assembly lines; the 
plant's 10,000 workers build nine different models, and both right-hand- and 
left-hand-drive versions of each. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, which produces 4 million cars a year in Japan, has just five Japanese 
assembly plants; GM has 36 North American assembly plants producing 5 million 
cars and trucks a year. None of GM's plants produce more than about 250,000 
vehicles annually. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain their manufacturing flexibility in the face of a worsening labor 
shortage in Japan, the Japanese auto companies are starting to make massive new 
investments in robotics in a nationwide campaign to dramatically increase their 
use of new forms of automation. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, which has worked hard throughout the 1980s to keep pace with the 
Japanese in robotics, seems destined to fall behind once more. 
</P>
<P>
Reinvesting the huge profits from their export boom, the Japanese are equipping 
some of their plants -- including their new ones in the United States -- with 
nearly twice as many robots as are installed in the typical Big Three factory. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Toyota's Motomochi assembly plant in Toyota City has 435 robots 
in just its body shop, where 93% of all sheet metal welding for the Toyota 
Cressida has been automated. At GM's huge Lake Orion, Mich., Cadillac factory, 
by comparison, there are only 163 robots in the entire plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in Japan is trying to increase their automation," said Kaname Kasai, 
general manager of Honda's Sayama assembly plant, which already has 480 robots. 
"We are trying to get more automation in areas of our plant where we have had 
quality inconsistencies in the past."

JAMES FLANIGAN: WHY DO THEY ADMIRE PHILIP MORRIS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and beer 
company, emerged as one of America's most admired corporations in this year's 
list in Fortune magazine, giving Merck &amp; Co., the pharmaceutical maker, a 
close run for first place. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris' strong points, according to Fortune -- which surveys 8,000 
corporate executives, directors and financial analysts for its rankings -- are 
quality of management, value as a long-term investment and ability to attract, 
develop and keep talented people. 
</P>
<P>
But the magazine mentions only in passing an obvious negative. Philip Morris is 
the leading producer of cigarettes -- Marlboro, Benson &amp; Hedges, Virginia 
Slims, and Merit, among other brands. And there are many Americans who don't 
think that cigarettes are admirable, including the U.S. government, which 
requires warnings on packages that say, "Smoking causes lung cancer, heart 
disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
How can a company that makes and sells such products be admired? Simple; for 
its business ability. Indeed, Philip Morris' very adroitness in diversifying 
away from cigarettes wins it compliments in Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that corporate types are oblivious to morality. It's just that 
American society -- so far -- has found the moral question of cigarettes to be 
one of personal choice. Court decisions in liability lawsuits against cigarette 
makers have found that smokers have been warned of the danger and proceed at 
their own risk. Smoking, although increasingly restricted in public, is lawful. 
</P>
<P>
However, lawsuits on different legal arguments could result in what, in effect, 
would be a ban on smoking in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
Which makes Philip Morris a particularly fascinating company at the moment -- 
because in more ways than one it reflects trends to watch in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
One trend is straightforward: Companies favored as investments in the '90s, say 
experts, will be those that consistently produce rising profits, as opposed to 
the takeover plays that dominated market attention in the 1980s. Even now, word 
is spreading about Philip Morris -- brokers calling clients to talk about it, 
prominent investment managers such as Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan Fund, 
listing it among "companies whose earnings are going to keep growing over the 
next three to five years -- and that's what matters." 
</P>
<P>
But Philip Morris also reflects another trend: a change in attitudes about the 
social responsibility of business that veteran Wall Streeters say could 
question corporate policies in the '90s. Significantly, tobacco companies may 
face new and different legal challenges. Some legal experts say a federal 
appeals court decision in Newark, N.J., just over a week ago opens the way for 
lawsuits on the inherent dangers of smoking. If juries find that the dangers of 
smoking outweigh its usefulness, then personal choice is not a question. 
Cigarettes could be outlawed, and there is even a possibility that producers 
could be held liable for damages -- as Johns-Manville Corp. was held liable for 
the damages of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The cigarette, a product of the 20th Century, may not make it to the 21st. But 
Philip Morris probably will. 
</P>
<P>
It's a smart outfit, one that in some ways other U.S. companies could study. 
It's highly competitive. A distant sixth in the industry 25 years ago, Philip 
Morris decided that if cigarettes were legal, it would make the best of it. It 
invested in advanced manufacturing equipment, became the low-cost producer and 
the leading U.S. tobacco company in the 1970s -- passing R. J. Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
By persistent efforts over two decades, Philip Morris built sales in foreign 
markets -- where people smoke more than Americans now do and the cigarette 
trade is often dominated, as in Japan and France, by a government-sanctioned 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
"It pays its suppliers promptly and its people well," says a former Philip 
Morris executive. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps most important, Philip Morris in the past five years has 
transformed itself, dramatically reducing its dependence on cigarettes. In 
1985, it acquired General Foods (Maxwell House coffee, Post cereals, Jell-O), 
and it bought Kraft Foods (cheese, mayonnaise) in 1988. Where tobacco gave 
Philip Morris 70% of sales and 90% of operating profit five years ago, in 1989 
food contributed 52% of sales -- which totaled roughly $45 billion -- and 30% 
of the more than $7 billion in operating income. 
</P>
<P>
And food will surpass tobacco as the principal source of profit within the next 
four years, says analyst Barry Ziegler of CL Global Partners, U.S. investing 
arm of the French bank Credit Lyonnais. All through the early '90s, says 
Ziegler, earnings will grow 15% to 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot, say some analysts, is that with one more food company acquisition a 
few years from now, Philip Morris may be able to kick the tobacco habit 
altogether. Given the trend of public opinion and new possibilities in 
litigation, that would be the smart thing to do. And though some may find it 
impossible to admire a maker of cigarettes, Philip Morris is a smart company.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TIME FOR THE DREAMERS TO WAKE UP TO UGLY REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street took a close look at reality on Friday and, boy, was it ugly. The 
stock market has been living a charmed life for the past few months. While bad 
things were happening to the economy, to the dollar, to interest rates and to 
other markets, equities couldn't do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The folks over at the stock exchange looked at things this way: If the economy 
was in a recession, that's good because interest rates would soon fall. And if 
the economy wasn't in a recession, that too is good because corporate profits 
would soon improve. Beside, they were telling themselves, everyone knows that 
the program traders who have been holding the stock index futures markets in 
Chicago hostage wouldn't let equity prices fall sharply, even if there were 
some bad news coming out on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the stock pros felt that nothing could go wrong. Prices would 
rise no matter what. But on Friday, the stock jockeys learned a lesson -- maybe 
only the first of many -- about just how wrong they can be. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported Friday morning that inflation on the producer level in 
December rose 0.7%, compared to just 0.2% in November. And even if you take out 
the rise in food and energy prices -- one of Wall Street's favorite ways of 
pooh-poohing inflation numbers that it doesn't like -- the rise was still 0.6%. 
Either way, the number was worse than the 0.5% that Wall Street was expecting. 
</P>
<P>
Just to make Wall Street's life really miserable, the government also announced 
that retail sales for December rose just 0.2%. That, too, hit like a bomb. In 
short, the two statistics may show that the nation is in the middle of an 
economic slowdown, and possibly a recession, that's accompanied by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a particularly good combination for anyone who's investing in 
stocks," says Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A few other things didn't go Wall Street's way last week. The Tokyo Stock 
Exchange recorded its eighth-worst loss ever on Friday. And discontent in the 
Soviet provinces created some investor unrest worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But none of these was the real reason that the Dow Jones industrial average 
fell 71.46 points on Friday. The real reason is that the Dow didn't belong at 
near-record levels in the first place. The Dow was kept bloated in the face of 
deteriorating economic conditions because the pros who control the stock index 
futures markets in Chicago wouldn't let the equities stage a normal, orderly 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
Even on Friday, when stock prices were headed for an obvious rout, major 
investment firms defied logic by buying large numbers of stock index futures 
contracts in Chicago. The heaviest index buying came around 3 p.m., I'm told, 
when Salomon Bros., Shearson Lehman Hutton and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. -- 
three of Wall Street's heavyweights -- made what looked like a concerted effort 
to reverse some of the markets losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow was down about 70 points at the time, and it did rally temporarily, but 
the "intervention" couldn't counteract the economic ugliness that investors 
finally noticed. I'd bet Salomon, Shearson and Goldman are already planning 
their buying strategies for Monday. And then the volatility will start all over 
again.

Icahn Finds This Is No Way to Run an Airline 
</P>
<P>
The press has often been accused of publishing stories about situations in 
which there are problems and then never following up when those problems get 
fixed. But in the case of Trans World Airlines, the opposite has been true. 
</P>
<P>
Investor Carl C. Icahn purchased the airline in 1986 and was widely, and 
loudly, heralded in the press as the company's savior. But Icahn has been 
lucky, so far, to dodge the blame now that TWA seems to be slipping. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (TWA) is doing poorly," Louis A. Marckesano, an airline analyst for 
Janney Montgomery Scott, a Philadelphia brokerage firm. "In (the airline) 
business you either grow or you fall behind. And they are falling behind." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, TWA announced that it was selling its Chicago-to-London routes, four 
gates and some maintenance facilities at Chicago's O'Hare Airport to American 
Airlines for $195 million. That sale came only after Icahn -- one of the 
nation's savviest investors but no whiz at running an airline -- tried, and 
apparently failed, to sell TWA (see below). 
</P>
<P>
Icahn has hinted in the past that he'd like to merge TWA with another airline. 
But informed sources say that was just a smoke screen. Icahn was really trying 
to unload the carrier and get his money out of that investment. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn's best opportunity to sell TWA came last summer when airlines were the 
hottest property on Wall Street. And that's when my sources tell me that Icahn 
was the most active in trying to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Icahn has been privately voicing his annoyance at the airline business. 
And union leaders at TWA, in turn, have been publicly voicing their annoyance 
at how Icahn has been treating the airline. 
</P>
<P>
But Icahn is no fool. He may be getting what he can for pieces of TWA -- just 
in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
According to Timothy Pettee, Merrill Lynch's airline analyst, ridership on TWA 
has been dwindling. In November, Pettee says, TWA's all-important revenue 
passenger miles fell 4.9%. It was the only airline of the five largest in 
America to register a loss. 
</P>
<P>
And TWA's planes went out only 56.5% loaded, Pettee says. That, too, was the 
worst of the five. Even beleaguered Pan Am, says Pettee, managed a 5% gain in 
revenue passenger miles, and its planes went out 58.4% loaded with passengers. 
</P>
<P>
(A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flying one mile.) 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he turned it around in 1986 and 1987," Pettee says of Icahn, adding that 
the acquisition of Ozark Airlines was probably the investor's most brilliant 
move. "But the airline is starved for capital." 
</P>
<P>
TWA is also suffering the consequences of factors not under its control. U.S. 
airlines, in general, haven't been able to entice as many travelers to Europe 
as they had been. Experts think it is the bombing of a Pan Am jet in Lockerbie, 
Scotland, last winter that is causing many travelers to fly on foreign 
airlines, especially on the Europe-to-U.S. leg of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, U.S. airlines had a 52% market share of traffic between Europe and the 
United States. In the first nine months of 1989, that number was just 46%. 
Unfortunately for TWA, that's its biggest market. 
</P>
<P>
Janney's Marckesano says Icahn signaled that he's losing interest in the 
airline business when he didn't jump at the chance to buy bankrupt Eastern 
Airlines. He could have used Eastern to feed passengers onto his foreign 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
"When he didn't take advantage of the Eastern situation, he was tacitly 
admitting he wasn't in the airline business long term," Marckesano says. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody at TWA returned my telephone calls. But if you know someone who wants to 
buy an airline, give Icahn a call. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Isn't Selling, but It May Be Buying 
</P>
<P>
If you bought Pan Am stock recently on takeover rumors, you might want to know 
what's really going on. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, rumors were published that Pan Am might be acquired by either 
American Airlines or TWA. There's a kernel of truth in this, but it will 
probably never pop. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street source very familiar with Pan Am tells me that on more than one 
occasion American Air has looked at the possible acquisition of Pan Am and 
decided -- on more than one occasion -- that it didn't want to make such a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
As far as TWA is concerned, the rumors that have been spreading around Wall 
Street are backward. It was Pan Am, I'm told by this source, that was 
discussing the acquisition of TWA, which investor Carl C. Icahn desperately 
wants to sell. It wasn't the other way around. Pan Am would then have spun off 
duplicate operations. 
</P>
<P>
There is some hope for Pan Am investors, however. For one thing, the airline's 
operations appear to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Pan Am's executives still think that an alliance with another airline 
would be very beneficial, and they've been talking with any airline that would 
listen. (That's how Pan Am came to have discussions with American Air.) 
</P>
<P>
Nobody should be surprised if Pan Am gets into merger/acquisition talks. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey securities regulators are trying to put Mr. Chutzpah, Barry Davis, 
in jail for paying a $15,000 fine with a rubber check. Davis was the 
"broadcaster" for a phone-in takeover tip hot line in New Jersey before that 
state chased him over the river into New York. Davis is said to be 
"broadcasting" his information from a pay phone in a Chinese restaurant near 
the George Washington Bridge . . . 
</P>
<P>
A number of Wall Street analysts suddenly reduced their earnings estimates last 
week on Delta Air Lines. How did they all come to the same conclusion 
simultaneously? Executives of Delta were personally calling the analysts and 
suggesting the move. Delta didn't bother to make a public statement until the 
next day -- something that should annoy small investors.

ANATOMY OF A BULLET WOUND; 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE SHOT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY. BUT, EXPERTS SAY, FEW OF US 
COMPREHEND A BULLET'S IMPACT. HERE, THE LAST 58 SECONDS IN THE LIFE OF A 
GUNSHOT VICTIM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Juan Antonio Mendez never felt what hit him. A bullet does that. The small lead 
plug moving close to the speed of sound shocks and deadens the tissue and 
organs it crushes. Fear and confusion heighten the torpor of a gunshot wound. 
And at this point in his armed robbery of an electronics store in Koreatown, 
Juan Mendez is in full panic. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has come apart. A young Brinks guard, Ramiro Garcia, isn't showing 
scared. Mendez's partner was able to grab the canvas cash sack from Garcia's 
left hand. But the guard isn't flinching, and that could mean he is ready to 
shoot it out. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez has no time to change moves, to control the next moments of his life, to 
run, to yelp, to back down or cancel his commitment to violence. 
</P>
<P>
He does have one moment to cock the hammer of his own gun, a museum piece -- a 
rusted, single-action, frontier-style .44 six-gun made by Remington in the 
1890s. 
</P>
<P>
But the guard is faster. Garcia's left hand sweeps the barrel of Mendez's 
handgun aside. His own revolver, a Brinks-issue Smith &amp; Wesson with a 
four-inch barrel and a full load of six .38 Special rounds, clears its black 
leather holster. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! Garcia's first shot hits Mendez high in the left chest. The range is so 
close that flakes of unburned gunpowder are forced through Mendez's brown 
sweater. They tattoo the edges of the chest wound. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! Mendez fires, but it is more of a reflex. The shot goes wild and slaps 
sideways into a store wall. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! A second bullet hits Mendez's chest, dead center. He stumbles, turning. 
Boom! A bullet in the right arm, from triceps through biceps and into the left 
knee. Mendez falls. 
</P>
<P>
Flat on his back, eyes fading, Mendez's dirty sneakers twitch against a display 
case of home security systems. "Double Entry Security" promises the sign. 
"Because Your Security And Peace of Mind Are Important." 
</P>
<P>
Mendez flops an arm across his bleeding chest. 
</P>
<P>
It is three days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Mendez has just 58 seconds to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Massad Ayoob is a former police officer and, as founder / director of Lethal 
Force Institute of Concord, N.H., a guru of combat competition shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 From South Africa to Long Beach, police departments seeking to improve their 
effectiveness -- and ordinary civilians afraid that police will never be able 
to do enough -- pay up to $500 per person for Ayoob's courses in self-defense 
by pistol and shotgun, knife, night stick and Kubotan baton. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames the media -- from George Peppard's fully automatic "A-Team" on 
television to Mel Gibson in gun-toting newspaper advertisements for "Lethal 
Weapon II" -- for fitting America with a "an insulating, subconscious callous 
that keeps us from recognizing the horror of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy (on television) gets hit in the head with a club and he passes out. 
He never retches, never vomits, never sees double, never goes into grand mal 
seizures . . . all of which occurs with people who have been struck in the head 
with blunt instruments. If they don't die. 
</P>
<P>
 "With gunshot wounds, the guy swoons and falls to the ground. There is no 
blood. Probably the height of the bull was the old Mannix series. At one point, 
Mannix is shot in the shoulder with a .458 elephant rifle by the millionaire 
villain. In the next scene, Mannix has got his arm in a little black sling and 
is hugging his new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "In real life, nobody has been shot with a .458 elephant rifle. But we have 
one case where a subject with a 45/70 (hunting) rifle shot a police officer 
wearing a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rifle was so powerful that it carried the vest into the wound channel, 
halfway through the body. The bullet struck at the right nipple, and there were 
ruptured blood vessels in the brain just from the backed up shock waves through 
the cardiovascular system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, death was instantaneous. This is a whole lot more in line with 
what happens when you get shot." 
</P>
<P>
 After Juan Mendez falls, there is a second of silence at ITC Electronics, 2772 
W. Olympic Blvd. Minds respond in the pause, trying to understand and deciding 
what might be next. The stench of gunpowder is everywhere. Then shouts and 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is crawling and sliding toward the store's counter. His bravery has been 
expensive. While rapid-firing against Mendez, the armored car guard put one 
round through his own knee. Garcia desperately needs cover and time to reload. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez's partner, however, isn't waiting for a rematch. He has the sack holding 
more than $20,000 in cash and checks. He sprints and shoves through shocked 
shoppers to an open door and the crowded street. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, even the flutter of Mendez's breathing has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The first bullet, a flat-nosed lead slug weighing 10.2 grams, or less than 1/2 
ounce, went into his chest angling down. It fractured the fifth rib on the way 
in, bored through both lobes of the left lung, and fractured the seventh rib on 
the way out. 
</P>
<P>
Not always a fatal wound. Not if the round avoids larger blood vessels. Not if 
the bullet hole seals itself and air doesn't enter the chest cavity and the 
lung does not collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The killer was the second shot. 
</P>
<P>
It hit the bone and cartilage of the sternum. That flattened the round a 
little, increasing its diameter and widening the wound channel it punched 
through the left ventricle chamber of Mendez's heart. The bullet left the 
heart, went into the left lung and exited Mendez's back. 
</P>
<P>
In its passage, the slug stretched and displaced for milliseconds the heart 
muscles, valves and chambers, forming what trauma surgeons know as the 
"temporary cavity." It created a temporary space the size of a baseball in 
Mendez's heart. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart continued to pump. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is squirting blood from the bullet holes in the heart wall, filling the 
pericardium and pouring into the chest cavity itself. At a rate of about five 
quarts a minute. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no pressure to carry blood through the aorta and a network of 
arteries to Mendez's brain. Not even to the blood vessels near the gunshot 
wounds in his right arm and left knee. So there is no bleeding there. 
</P>
<P>
No blood, no oxygen. No oxygen, no working body cells. Then veins collapse. 
Electricity and neuromuscular activities stop. 
</P>
<P>
Barely a minute after the first shot, the only movement connected to Mendez is 
a puddle of blood creeping from two exit wounds in his back. 
</P>
<P>
It shines like maroon glue on the store floor. 
</P>
<P>
As life finally leaves Juan Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Monaghan is full of holes. He can close his eyes, point to arms, legs and 
chest, and finger-count 11 wounds from bullets and shrapnel. A former Green 
Beret captain and veteran of five combat tours of Vietnam, Monaghan, 51, now a 
technical consultant and scriptwriter to movie studios, has survived four 
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst, he says, was in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 A Viet Cong soldier shot him in the left shoulder with an AK-47 assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I killed him," Monaghan says. "But his shot hit my M-16, blew the upper 
hand guard apart and pieces of the weapon were flying everywhere. One piece 
killed the man standing next to me, ripped his whole face off, and the bullet 
ricocheted and went into my shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smashed the clavicle, the thing that holds the muscle leads from the 
tendon and the biceps muscle . . . and as a result, the muscles, the biceps 
muscle and then the left chest muscle, the one that guards the heart, began 
falling down. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it burns. That's the first thing that happens to you. It's just like a 
red hot poker or an ice pick burning into you. Then it knocks you down. It is 
like somebody swinging at you with a baseball bat. As hard as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the burning. I remember thinking that if I had time to pour a canteen of 
water on it, everything would be OK. But it didn't quite work out that way. I 
went for about 10 more minutes and then I just passed out from loss of blood 
and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out (in the hospital or convalescing) for eight months. And it still 
hurts. It's a private pain, but it ain't easy. There are times when I'm in bed 
and dreaming, and I'll begin jumping and I can feel those bullets hitting. If I 
move my arm the wrong way, that sudden, searing pain feels like the round is 
still entering, still moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been down to the (Long Beach) Naval hospital several times and up to the 
Presidio (Letterman Army Hospital), and they keep telling me that there will 
have to be operations done on the thing again. I'm postponing it. I'll take 
Advil or aspirins or, once in a while if it really hurts, I'll take some 
codeine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can just feel that fire in there. All the time." 
</P>
<P>
At 5:34 p.m., four minutes after death, official hands are attending Juan 
Mendez. A uniformed officer from LAPD's Rampart Division, who was patroling 
nearby and made it to the store while gunpowder smells are still hanging, 
touches his fingertips to Mendez's neck. No pulse. 
</P>
<P>
The six-gun -- a souvenir of a supposedly wilder West -- is recovered and taken 
to the trunk of a police car. "Who did he think he was going against?" an 
officer mutters. "Clint Eastwood?" 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department paramedics from Engine Co. 13 deliver their boxes and monitors. 
Some attend guard Garcia and his knee. Others stare down at Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
Scissors cut away his brown sweater. 
</P>
<P>
The red-black bullet holes are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Especially one in the center of Mendez's chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the right place," says paramedic George Balleweg. "Great shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Three electrodes from a Lifepak 5 monitor are attached to Mendez's trunk. It is 
probably a formality. A six-inch strip of tape hisses from the machine and the 
line is quite straight. There is no electrical activity in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Balleweg crumples the tape and tosses it. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers -- lieutenants and sergeants and street cops from this volatile 
area of town -- peer at Mendez before a sheet is pulled over his body and face. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody recognize this guy? . . . looks like a rock smoker, one of those dirt 
bags from down the street . . . nobody I know . . . probably an illegal . . . 
you want to look, Jim?" 
</P>
<P>
Yellow plastic tape is unrolled to seal the aisles and area where Mendez fell. 
There are blood smears here. Unspent cartridges there. Physical evidence that 
must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives Larry De Losh and Joe Getherall, partners from LAPD's 
robbery-homicide division, arrive from Parker Center downtown to build the 
foundation of another investigation. For these men, the end of Juan Mendez is 
only a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez's face is uncovered for Frank Giles. He's a city photographer. Giles has 
lost count of the bodies he's photographed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have many emotions about it," Giles says. "But sometimes I look at a 
guy like this one and I think that we probably got up about the same time 
today, in the same city, had breakfast and went our separate ways. Then we meet 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is, I get to take the pictures of him and he doesn't get to 
see the New Year." 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's investigator Tom Ratcliffe bends over Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
He stabs him lightly with a scalpel. On the right side, just below the rib 
cage, Ratcliffe inserts a thermometer, pushing it down and then hard up and 
into the liver, where its temperature will set the official time of death. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez is carrying no money, no identification. Just a comb, an empty leather 
billfold and a stainless steel digital watch. His name and Salvadoran 
citizenship will be established later through fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's no guarantee that he really is Juan Antonio Mendez. That's just the 
name he gave when arrested in June on two counts of possessing and selling 
crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Ratcliffe grabs the cuffs of Mendez's pants. An assistant holds Mendez's 
wrists. The body is jackknifed and tugged onto a collapsed gurney, wrapped and 
strapped down, and wheeled through the store to an unmarked county van. 
</P>
<P>
A policeman says something. Very quietly. 
</P>
<P>
The words hold anger for an enemy. Yet their tone carries one fragment of 
empathy for the death of a human being. 
</P>
<P>
"Feliz Navidad, knucklehead." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Fackler was a combat surgeon in Vietnam and is director of the 
Wound Ballistics Laboratory at the Letterman Army Institute of Research, 
Presidio of San Francisco. He also is an Army colonel who wages constant war 
against the mystique and misinformation surrounding weapons and wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 An AK-47 assault rifle, he states, is not as deadly as the public believes. 
And many more children might have died in a Stockton schoolyard last year had 
Patrick Purdy used a hunting rifle or a 12-gauge shotgun instead of an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of a gunshot wound, Fackler explains, has little to do with the 
velocity of so-called "high-powered rifles" but is heavily influenced by "the 
mass of the projectile (bullet), how heavy it was, the construction, the shape, 
the type of tissue it hits, did it hit the liver or the intestines, did it hit 
anything to disturb its path before it hit this person? 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you realize," he asks, "that the muzzle velocity of the AK-47 is less than 
the muzzle velocity of the weapon that was adopted by at least three European 
armed forces in 1891? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are simply two mechanisms, basically, as the bullet penetrates the 
body. It makes a bullet hole (permanent cavity); in other words, the bullet 
hitting the body tissues destroys, disintegrates and crushes what it hits. 
There is a second (mechanism) that is much more dramatic and has been 
emphasized far out of proportion -- the temporary cavity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (temporary cavity) is the same thing as a splash in water. You toss a 
rock into water, the water parts momentarily and then comes back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temporary cavity (inside human tissue) does increase with the velocity of 
the projectile (bullet), but (it) increases a lot more with changes in 
projectile shape. Think of a diver going off a 10-meter board . . . going into 
the water with an excellent dive. High velocity. Very little disruption of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, same diver, same mass and everything . . . but going off a two-meter 
board at much lower velocity. If he does a belly flopper, he makes a much 
bigger splash. And bullets do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they (bullets) are going through tissue . . . straight ahead, and 
not yawing at all, they make very little damage . . . after the bullet starts 
yawing (in tissue), it will go to 90 degrees and is likely to go to 180 degrees 
(tumbling). In other words, have its path exactly reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (United States) M-16 projectile tends to yaw after about five inches. The 
AK-47 round, using the (7.62 millimeter) standard Chinese or Russian military 
ball ammunition, doesn't generally yaw until it goes about 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the stuff that has been coming out of Los Angeles in the aftermath of 
this Purdy shooting (where Purdy used 7.62 mm military-type ammunition) has 
been really unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got (hospital) people that are quoted as saying: 'Assault rifles are 
so bad that if a person is hit in an extremity it must be amputated and if he 
is hit in the trunk he is dead.' And another guy saying: 'The chances of you 
dying if you're hit by an assault rifle are 50%.' These things are absolutely 
ludicrous, absolutely non-factual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Mr. Purdy's kill rate. Thirty-five hits and five deaths. That's not a 
high kill rate. If you wish to add up massacres, not only of Mr. Purdy but of 
Mr. Wesbecker (Joseph T. Wesbecker) in Louisville and a few others, you will 
find that when an assault rifle is used as the primary weapon . . . you have 
more than twice as many wounded as are killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a shotgun is used, you have more than twice as many killed as are 
wounded. This summer there was a fellow over in France who used a shotgun and 
killed 14 and wounded seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be hit with a short-range shotgun. It takes a lot of tissue 
and makes mush out of it. And this tissue doesn't work very well afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
Juan Mendez has a new identity. He is 89-12450. 
</P>
<P>
That means he died in 1989 and is the year's 12,450th victim of an undetermined 
or violent end in which the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office 
assumes physical jurisdiction over the body. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that authority is the decision to perform an autopsy. Ten thousand 
corpses were opened and examined by the county last year. It is decided Mendez 
will be one. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsy, by necessity, is a detached and indelicate process. But then, the 11 
physician-pathologists handling 800 autopsies each month have no time for 
surgical delicacies, fancy incisions or needlework. Nor need they work with 
post-operative concerns for those wheeled into these grim and smelly basement 
operating rooms between the Southern Pacific railway yards and County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In one room, all six stainless steel tables often are occupied. Dead by the 
dozens are waiting. Some incoming addicts, derelicts, traffic victims, male and 
female, the stabbed, beaten and shot of our county, must wait stiff and 
uncovered on gurneys in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez, unwashed and naked but for the blue 89-12450 identification tag wired 
to his big toe, is brought in. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christopher Rogers, 31, will do the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives De Losh and Getherall are observing. 
</P>
<P>
Doctor and detectives wear disposable masks, gowns and paper bootees. That 
wasn't always standard. But then came AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers says he is fascinated by the work. Sure, he could earn more in private 
medicine. But, he says, he enjoys the puzzle-solving of being a forensic 
pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
He starts work, and it is not subtle. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinary pair of pruning shears are used as rib cutters. A soup ladle 
collects blood samples from Mendez's thorax. Washing off instruments, not 
constant sterilization, is the rule. Then some are dumped in a cardboard box; 
the hand-written sign on it states: "Knives To Be Sharpened." 
</P>
<P>
This case isn't much of a puzzle for Rogers. Guided by X-rays, he finds a 
bullet in Mendez's left knee. The joint, quite bloodless, is opened and the 
slug pried out for De Losh. 
</P>
<P>
It is a flat-nosed .38 and clearly from guard Garcia's gun. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers measures the bullet holes in Mendez's chest. He marks their positions, 
their angles and their passages on a diagram of a man; the chart will become 
evidence. Then Rogers inserts a steel rod through each wound channel. 
</P>
<P>
"We have potential entrances one, two and three, and potential exits one, two 
and three, and one here in the knee . . . now, one through the sternum, right 
through the heart, through the left lung and exits . . . and that is the 
rapidly fatal wound. 
</P>
<P>
"This one here, left chest, came in at intermediate range because we see the 
(gunpowder) stipling . . . it fractured the fifth rib and then it goes through 
both lobes of the left lung, then out, fracturing the rib, left seven. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll make the cause of death multiple gunshot wounds." 
</P>
<P>
It is a 90-minute task, and as with all daily routines, there is chatter 
unrelated to the work. Of whether the Vatican will give up Manuel Noriega. Of a 
Christmas gift of tickets for "Phantom of the Opera." Of old friends and new 
cars, living in Los Angeles and dead villains. 
</P>
<P>
When it is done, Mendez is sutured; the stitches are huge and made with waxed 
twine. His hair is given a final shampoo. He is wrapped in plastic with arms 
and legs trussed tight by lengths of rope. 
</P>
<P>
He is wheeled to a crypt, and in storage at 35 degrees, Mendez joins the 
county's permanent population of 300 corpses in processing. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a while since robbery specialists De Losh and Getherall have 
witnessed an autopsy. They say it doesn't bother them. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless it's a kid," De Losh says. 
</P>
<P>
"Or a cop," Getherall adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Marshall was a homicide investigator and a Detroit cop for 20 years. He 
has shot suspects, had suspects shoot at him, and now directs the criminal 
justice program at Kirtland College, Ross Common, Mich. A columnist for Combat 
Handguns and Guns &amp; Ammo magazines, he sees himself as "a student of 
ammunition construction and effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall knows that poison-tipped rounds and explosive bullets are effective 
only in Ian Fleming novels. But he also knows the serious attention law 
enforcement agencies are giving two radical handgun bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 One, the Glaser, is a thin, copper-jacketed round that flies like a 
conventional bullet and bursts on impact. It releases miniature lead shot and 
creates broad penetration similar to a shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is a super-light, plastic plug weighing less than a quarter of a 
conventional .38 bullet. Muzzle velocity of the Thunderzap is more than twice 
the speed of sound -- faster than a bullet from an M-16 assault rifle -- but 
the light weight of the projectile allows total dissipation of energy at 100 
yards. Before that, however, the round fragments on impact and, according to 
current advertising, creates "vicious flesh destruction . . . shatters ribs and 
blows rib pieces into lung tissue." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall has also studied the Army's Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program and 
its evaluation of a bullet embedded in a bullet, so-called "duplex rounds" that 
are relatively unstable and designed to tumble immediately upon impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ACR ammunition contender fires a small steel arrow, a flechette, and 
there's a French round of solid brass said to have penetrated 37 layers of the 
Kevlar used in bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
 But their effectiveness is easily argued, Marshall says, and the truth of the 
ammunition matter hasn't changed much since the days of cannon and musket 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen instances where people were shot with a standard .38 Special, round 
nosed, lead ammo, and other people shot with a 125 grain, .357 magnum 
hollow-point. You dissect both wound channels and the differences are very 
subtle. You don't open up the person shot with a .357 magnum and their organs 
are all turned to jelly, and they don't all slide out of the body. It just 
doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bullet placement is really the key. As I used to tell my (police) academy 
classes: 'The three most important things to remember when talking about 
ammunition are -- bullet placement, bullet placement, bullet placement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I routinely tell people that anyone who takes any handgun to a lethal 
confrontation isn't very wise. Because handguns, by and large, don't stop 
people very well. Generally, with handguns, to produce incapacitation, we've 
got to produce death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We carry handguns because they offer concealability and portability, and in 
the area of law enforcement, police generally end up relying on handguns 
because people in this country have got used to seeing police officers carrying 
handguns. In other countries, police routinely walk around with submachine guns 
and nobody gets really excited about that. But I guess we're not quite ready 
for that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement requirements are quite different from military attitudes. 
They (military) want to wound people because that ties up medics and many other 
support personnel. In law enforcement, the aim is to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two ways to get what we (police) call 'instant 
incapacitation.' One is to sever the spine, which, of course, produces death. 
The other is a brain shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is extremely difficult to produce incapacitation without producing 
death. What we have seen (with handguns) is countless instances where people 
have taken hit after hit after hit and not gone down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the adrenaline gets dumped in the system . . . (many) people don't feel 
getting hit the second, third or fourth time. We've seen instances where 
basically, in order to stop people who are bent on killing other people, you 
sometimes almost have to shoot them to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "That justifiably horrifies people. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as far as the technology of a bullet itself . . . the only humane bullet 
is one that is never fired." 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after death, Juan Mendez, 28, makes one contribution to life. His 
corneas are removed, sent to the Doheny Eye Bank and will be implanted to 
restore sight in others. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has asked for the rest of Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
His police record shows no address or names of family. He is presumed to be an 
illegal alien. Just in case, his description and fingerprints will be checked 
through the Veteran's Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the 
Criminal Identification and Information office of the state Department of 
Justice and other official clearing houses. 
</P>
<P>
In about 60 days, if no leads are found, Mendez will be declared "Indigent 
Dead." 
</P>
<P>
He will be taken to the county crematory in East Los Angeles. His ashes will be 
held for two years. Then they will be scattered at a common site. 
</P>
<P>
The bullets that took his life will be sealed in plastic envelopes and held in 
LAPD's property room until no legal considerations surround the case. 
</P>
<P>
And a few small, impersonal, inanimate, valueless lumps of lead will outlive 
Juan Mendez by many years. 
</P>
<P>
FATAL PASSAGE 
</P>
<P>
The first shot fired at Juan Mendez was at close range, striking him high on 
the left side of the chest, angling down and fracturing the fifth rib. That 
bullet continued on, penetrating both lobes of his left lung before fracturing 
the seventh rib and exiting the back close to the spine. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet that killed Mendez entered his chest cavity through the sternum, 
striking downward through the left ventricle of the heart before exiting his 
back. It crushed and destroyed tissue by forming a wound channel known as the 
permanent cavity, which would likely be further widened if the bullet flattened 
out after striking the sternum. For milliseconds after passage of the bullet, 
the walls of the permanent cavity, including within the heart, are stretched 
outward. This lateral tissue displacement forms a temporary cavity that may 
have no effect on elastic muscle but can cause devastating disruption of soft 
organs.

THE TWO WHO FLEW OVER ALASKA'S VOLCANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAKE CLARK NATIONAL PARK, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For days after Redoubt Volcano erupted Dec. 13, the weather was so bad that no 
airplane could get near the 10,197-foot mountain -- except one. 
</P>
<P>
That was a Cessna 185 flown by Hollis Twitchell, Lake Clark National Park's 
only year-round ranger and one of a handful of National Park Service 
pilot-rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a week-and-a-half before other planes (from Anchorage) were able to fly 
over the volcano. We were lucky. We were in the National Park where the volcano 
is located and we were upwind from the mountain," explained Twitchell, 39, a 
ranger in the park since its establishment in December, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"We flew to the peak, some 45 miles from our airstrip, made observations, shot 
still photos and videotaped the spectacular event," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hutchison, 55, Lake Clark National Park superintendent who is based in 
Anchorage in winter and spends summer in the park, happened to be at Lake Clark 
when the volcano blew its top a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchison flew several times with Twitchell. The first photographs in 
newspapers and the first footage shown on TV around the world were shot by the 
two men. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial eruption, "a lava dome a quarter of a mile to a half-mile 
across formed on the north flank of Redoubt beneath the summit. Then a second 
major eruption occurred Jan. 2. When Hollis and I flew over the volcano after 
that blowout, the dome was gone. It had been blasted 20 miles down the mountain 
into Cook Inlet," said Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
"Lava flowing out of the mountain looks gray like tooth paste," Twitchell said. 
"It isn't flaming red as one would expect. Cascading down the mountain through 
the Drift River drainage are smoldering boulders, steaming debris. We have been 
shooting close-ups of the amazing glacial melt." 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell also described the towering ash plumes during the three major 
eruptions -- Dec. 13, Jan. 2 and "the biggest so far, more than 8 miles high" 
last Monday. He mentioned the "incredible display of lightning horizontally, 
vertically, all directions, bouncing off snow-covered peaks" on the night of 
Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
It was a plume of ash from Redoubt on Dec. 1 that choked off power in four 
engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747, causing the jet to fall more 
than 2 miles before the engines restarted and the plane made a safe emergency 
landing in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
News reports locate the mountain 110 miles southwest of Anchorage but fail to 
place the volcano in Lake Clark National Park. One of the reasons is because 
few have ever heard of, let alone visited, Lake Clark National Park and 
National Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
The park and preserve together total 4 million acres, almost twice the size of 
Yellowstone. "A national preserve administered by the Park Service is something 
unique to Alaska. It's an area where hunting is permitted. Here, the principal 
game taken, in season, are caribou, moose, Dall sheep and bear," Hutchison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The national park and national preserve, which don't have any paved roads or 
any man-made trails, are so remote that access is almost entirely by charter 
planes, private planes and Lake Clark Air, a small commuter operation that 
flies 140 miles from Anchorage to Port Alsworth, which is on the shores of Lake 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
There are six small lodges on Lake Clark, open four months of the year and 
booked far in advance. The lodges have float planes to fly hunters into remote 
areas, where they are dropped off and picked up a week to 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain climbers, hikers, river rafters and fishermen are also flown into 
wilderness areas on float planes. But the park is so vast and visitors are so 
few, it is rare for anyone to encounter another human being in the spectacular 
back country. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of glaciers. One glacier alone, Double Glacier, 100 square 
miles, is bigger than most national parks. The park is riveted with cascading 
wild and scenic rivers, innumerable crystal-clear mountain lakes, a chaotic 
jumbo of towering peaks, serrated ridges and sheer granite spires. 
</P>
<P>
The Tusk, a 5,730-foot monolith resembling a giant canine tooth, was scaled the 
first time a couple of years ago. Hundreds of other peaks have never been 
climbed. The terrain is so rugged that man has never set foot in most of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The park and preserve are named after the 42-mile-long, 1- to 4-mile-wide 
alpine lake embraced by the awesome Chigmit Mountains. The unbelievably 
stunning lake was discovered by John W. Clark in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Port Alsworth, the only community in the park and preserve, has a year-round 
population of 30, half of them students in the Port Alsworth Elementary School. 
There are no stores, no restaurants, no doctors, no nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Since the only landing strip in the park and preserve is in Port Alsworth, 
Twitchell lands his Cessna or Piper Super Cub on gravel bars, beaches, tundra, 
and frozen rivers and lakes in the winter to monitor wildlife populations and 
to mount rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
Every year during the last nine years, the pilot-ranger has flown search 
patterns for more than a dozen light planes that have crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous place to fly. Miserable weather closes in within minutes. 
Some private pilots overload their planes with game and passengers. There are 
many accidents and loss of life," said Twitchell. 
</P>
<P>
He is the nearest thing to a doctor, rendering first aid to hikers, hunters, 
mountain climbers and fishermen who have heart attacks, falls or meet with 
other mishaps. Then he flies them to a hospital in Anchorage, 1 1/2 hours away 
by small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its own erupting volcano, Lake Clark will continue to be little-known 
and seldom-visited. Although the scenery is unrivaled, the National Park is too 
remote and too difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
Park superintendent Hutchison expects a few people to charter airplanes and fly 
over the volcano when it quiets down. "But no one will be hiking up the 
mountain to look into the crater or walk the lava-encrusted path of debris," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nowhere nearby to land an airplane, and the terrain is inaccessible 
and too distant to reach on foot," he said. "Redoubt Volcano would be a 
tremendous drawing card in any other National Park, but unfortunately not 
here."

SWEET DREAMS OF A LATINO DANCE GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCISCO MARTINEZ REMAINS UNDAUNTED BY LACK OF FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE 
VISIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Choreographer Francisco Martinez first heard Patsy Cline's "Sweet Dreams" when 
he crossed into Texas from Mexico at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't understand English, but I remember hearing it. The melody stuck in my 
head," he said. Indeed, Martinez later choreographed the ballet "Sweet Dreams" 
(1983) as a tribute to Cline for his Van Nuys-based Francisco Martinez Dance 
Theatre. But he had no idea how accurately the lyrics, about unrequited love, 
would mirror his career. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is a quiet man of medium stature whose vision is to establish a 
company along the line of Arthur Mitchell's predominantly black Dance Theatre 
of Harlem, a company "for Hispanics, primarily." 
</P>
<P>
His goal has proven to be elusive, but at 38, the Monterrey, Mexico, native 
remains undaunted by the dual obstacles -- funding and performance visibility 
-- he has faced since first starting the company in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
For almost nine years, Dance Theatre has survived on donations, ticket sales 
and Martinez's own money (he works in a law office and as a dance teacher at 
Plaza de la Raza in downtown Los Angeles). The troupe will perform next Sunday 
as part of The Dance Gallery Presentations of Works in Progress at the Gascon 
Institute in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The company's last performance (October, 1989) cost about $5,000, Martinez 
said. About $2,000 came from private donations, $225 from the proceeds of a 
spring performance, $2,000 from Martinez's own pocket and "the other $800 came 
from our ticket sales. If we sell 250 seats at the Norris Theatre in Palos 
Verdes, that means I can keep some money in a cushion fund for the next 
performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When money's good, we can have three performances; when it isn't, two -- one 
in the spring and one at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
A lack of funding has not only limited the number of performances Martinez can 
give, it has kept the Van Nuys resident "from performing in my own back yard. I 
can't afford to dance in the Valley. I don't think the theaters are so 
expensive, but the insurance is what's keeping me from making my debut here," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have wonderful facilities at Pierce College and Northridge, but I would 
have to carry my own insurance, which is very expensive. Every time I perform 
at the Norris or at Plaza de la Raza, I buy into their policies for 48 hours, 
and for my budget that is more convenient." (The two public colleges do not 
carry liability insurance for outside performance events.) 
</P>
<P>
Other costs for Martinez include theater rental ($1,500 for the Norris Theatre) 
and a total of $1,500 to his dancers for the performances. 
</P>
<P>
"On Sundays when we rehearse, I bring them breakfast in lieu of payment," he 
said. "That's all I can afford and still they keep coming back to dance with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
For each performance he spends about $2,000 for costumes, technical assistance, 
flyers, programs and postage. 
</P>
<P>
Last year for the first time, Martinez received a matching grant of $1,000 from 
the National/State/County Partnership Award. Although the grant will not 
facilitate an appearance in the San Fernando Valley or additional payments to 
his dancers, it has allowed him to pay the 14 members of his company a modest 
salary for their 10 hours of rehearsal per week for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduling has been the other deterrent to high visibility. When his company 
made its debut in 1984, the only dates he could book at the Norris Theatre 
happened to coincide with the Olympic Arts Festival. The result: no press 
coverage. Since then performances have competed with heavyweights such as the 
Joffrey, American Ballet Theatre and, last Oct. 28, an evening with former 
Alvin Ailey star Judith Jamison. "There isn't much I can do about that because 
I have to take the dates the theaters have available, but knock on wood, things 
will change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Change has been a major factor for the fifth of 10 children. Born into a 
Seventh-day Adventist family, he found at 20 that dance was his great love. 
Martinez performed with the Fort Worth Ballet from 1975-79, graduated in 1978 
with a bachelor of fine arts in dance from Texas Christian University and 
studied with such dance luminaries as Alwin Nikolais, Jose Limon and Murray 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
He finds it amazing that with an eclectic repertory that includes the classical 
"Pas de Quatre," contemporary ballets such as "Sweet Dreams," "Flowers" (a 
tribute to painter Georgia O'Keeffe) and the work-in-progress "Hunter Suite" 
(based on the blues songs of Alberta Hunter), that people "come up to me and 
say, 'Oh, we thought you did Mexican hat dances, not ballet and modern.' " 
</P>
<P>
His point of view is precisely what helped his troupe earn a spot on the Works 
in Progress program. Barry Glass, artistic director of Aman Folk Ensemble and 
one of six panel members who helped select the companies that will appear in 
the Works in Progress, said, "We chose everyone who is in the series because we 
felt the artist's work was of interest, was significant and that the artist was 
able to articulate his point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez wishes to keep furthering a Latino influence in ballet. He is 
researching "Luna en Octubre," "an ethnic ballet based on rural Mexican folk 
songs and childhood games. It's my interpretation of my life in Mexico that I'm 
trying to recapture through movement." 
</P>
<P>
The ballet classes he teaches at Plaza de la Raza are part of his dream for his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some wonderful students, five boys and 10 girls," he says of the 
children of Lincoln Heights with whom he not only communicates bilingually but 
"alma a alma" or "soul to soul." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope some day to be able to draw from my students. They'll be used to me as 
a teacher and a choreographer and make that logical step into my company." But 
he added, "right now I want them to have fun, to be proud of who they are and 
to learn to follow their dreams -- no matter what -- as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Martinez Dance Theatre will perform Jan. 21 in a double bill with 
choreographer Rudy Perez as part of The Dance Gallery Presentations of Works in 
Progress at the Gascon Institute in Culver City, 8735 Washington Blvd. Tickets 
are $10 for the general public and $8 for seniors and students. For information 
call (213) 627-5666.

PIZZI'S HONOR; 
</P>
<P>
PURSUIT OF BASSOON LESSONS BROUGHT WOODWIND ARTIST TO L.A., WHERE HE PLAYS 
STUDIO SESSIONS AND 'CASUALS' WITH EQUAL GLEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ray Pizzi, whose woodwind artistry has been tapped by such Oscar-winning 
film composers as Henry Mancini, decided to move from Boston in 1970, some of 
the forces propelling him to Southern California were obvious. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to see if he could make it in the musical major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But there was another reason for the move: Pizzi wanted to study the bassoon. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Pizzi, who received his BA from the jazz-based Berklee School of 
Music and his MA in music performance from the Boston Conservatory, had been 
teaching music in a secondary school near Boston for over five years. 
</P>
<P>
And while he liked the work, and relished exercising his jazz saxophone chops 
with some of Boston's best bands -- from Herb Pomeroy's big band to Gene di 
Stacio's Brass Menagerie -- Pizzi believed he owed it to himself to take a shot 
at the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Plus he wanted to take lessons from Simon Kovar. Pizzi discovered from 
associates that Kovar, a former second bassoonist with the New York 
Philharmonic, was considered to be one of the finest teachers of the large 
double-reed instrument -- along with former Los Angeles Philharmonic bassoonist 
Frederic Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had to either go to New York or L.A., so when I found out that 
Simon lived in Los Angeles, I moved here," Pizzi said while standing in the 
small guest house behind his Van Nuys home that serves as his studio. 
</P>
<P>
In his almost 20 years here, he's played or recorded with the cream of the 
crop: Dizzy Gillespie, Quincy Jones, Barbra Streisand, Frank Zappa, Shelly 
Manne, Horace Silver, Bobby McFerrin. And Pizzi, who, like idol Sonny Rollins, 
is rarely seen without a hat of one kind or another, has become a bassoon whiz. 
</P>
<P>
In Kovar's hands, Pizzi -- who began on clarinet at age 5 and added tenor 
saxophone at 14 -- showed a real talent for the instrument that he laughingly 
admitted he "couldn't figure out how to put together" when he first got it in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Simon was retired but he took me on, and really took an interest in me," said 
Pizzi, dressed in a black sweat shirt, jeans and Panama hat. "I studied with 
him three times a week. Sometimes the lessons ran three hours, and because of 
his devotion to me, I really developed." 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 through 1984, he was voted the Most Valuable Player on bassoon by his 
studio session colleagues, the performing members of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"That felt fantastic, to be chosen by your peers," he said in the kitchen of 
the home he shares with his wife, Marilyn, and their two children, Alicia and 
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when Mancini was commissioned by the New American Orchestra to write a 
piece, his opus was titled "Piece for Jazz Bassoon and Orchestra." It was 
written specifically for Pizzi and premiered by him with the orchestra at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion that year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard what he could do with it, his command of the instrument was so 
awesome, I said, 'I gotta write this piece,' " said Mancini -- who first used 
Pizzi on "The Mancini Generation" CBS TV show in 1972. "Bassoon is not an easy 
instrument to play and to pick it up and play it like a flute or a saxophone is 
quite an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Pizzi makes most of his public appearances on bassoon with the Wind 
Syndicate, a trio that includes clarinetist Morton Lewis and flutist Miriam 
Sosewitz, which was spotlighted at a recent Royce Hall concert with the New 
American Orchestra and can be heard Jan. 24 at the Comeback Inn in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough about these people," he said. "They take those notes on the 
paper and make it music. I haven't been this excited about a project of mine in 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing together for three years, the regular classical 
literature," he continued. "But since I came back from Germany, where I toured 
for three weeks last May strictly as a jazz artist, I have been orchestrating 
my originals for the group." 
</P>
<P>
How does Pizzi describe his trio's music? "Oh, man," he said, stopping, 
spreading his hands in frustration, searching for words. "I call it 
third-stream jazz-classical. There are pieces that are kind of classical, kind 
of jazz, some humorous, some passionate, with little improvising." 
</P>
<P>
Though it might seem that bassoon is Pizzi's main instrument, he quickly begs 
to differ. "Bassoon, saxophones, flute, clarinet, I love them all," he said, 
"but if there is one main horn, the tenor saxophone would be that. All of the 
hard work, the learning about music, came about on the saxophone. My personal 
maturity is most evident on the tenor." 
</P>
<P>
The tenor side of "Pizzaman," as Pizzi jokingly calls himself, is on tap at 
Residuals in Studio City where he appears Sunday, and Jan. 25 at Alfonse's in 
Toluca Lake with accordionist Frank Marocco, guitarist Al Viola and drummer 
Paul Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
Behind closed doors, Pizzi remains active in the Los Angeles studio scene, 
where recent assignments have included work with Mancini and with Jeremy 
Lubbock, who used the multi-reedman in a big-band setting behind Madonna on the 
score of the upcoming Warren Beatty film "Dick Tracy" and a couple of TV films 
with Johnny Mandel, best known for his haunting ballad, "The Shadow of Your 
Smile." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he has been so successful, Pizzi thought a moment, then said: "These 
guys hire me to do what I do, to make it music. If a note needs an attitude, I 
can give it. I play silly, I play funny, I play sad." 
</P>
<P>
Like many top-flight session players, the 46-year-old Pizzi also works the 
occasional "casual" -- musicians' parlance for private parties. He likes the 
balance, not to mention the income, they provide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm versatile, so it never gets to be boring," he said, smiling. "Sure, it's 
not busy all the time, but I do enough things that I'm not depending on one arm 
of the business to keep me busy. I have done nothing but play my instruments 
for the past 20 years. No day gigs. Not a one. And that's lucky. You can be a 
fine musician but you still have to be lucky. Timing is everything. 
</P>
<P>
"My thing, and this is what I've been trying to teach my kids, is that it's got 
to be fun. If it's not fun, forget it. I'll play tunes for people at parties 
who want to dance. Fine. I ain't that proud. If I'm playing good music and I'm 
playing my heart, that's all I need to do." 
</P>
<P>
As for career highlights, Pizzi listed the following: "Working with people like 
Hank Mancini, Johnny Mandel, Dan Foliart, John Williams and Jack Elliot, who 
have all been so loyal. Playing the Mancini piece at the Hollywood Bowl in 
1987, with my mother in the audience. Getting in some hot tenor solos on the 
sound track of 'Grease,' playing my bassoon in the score for that weird 
nightclub scene in 'Return of the Jedi,' appearing at the Monterey Jazz 
Festival with Bobby McFerrin and Toots Thielemans in 1987, and, of course, the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie" is "End of the Rainbow," a short art film by Laszlo Papas and 
Marino Colmano in which Pizzi stars as a down-and-out saxophonist, freezing in 
a squalid London flat (it was actually shot in downtown Los Angeles). He 
hallucinates and thinks he sees a rainbow, and this inspires him to pick up his 
saxophone, walk to the fire escape and play "Over the Rainbow." But he can't 
remember the bridge, the two-note-based middle portion that fits the words, 
"Someday I'll wish upon a star, and wake up where the clouds are far behind me. 
. . ." He's so depressed at forgetting the passage that he jumps from the fire 
escape, and as he lies dying in the street, he opens his eyes and, in an ironic 
twist, recognizes that the two notes of the arriving ambulance's swaying Klaxon 
horn are the very notes that begin the portion of the song he had forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably the high point of my life," he said. "I was spoiled rotten 
for seven days. The star of the movie. 'What would you like now, Mr. Pizzi?' An 
unbelievable experience." 
</P>
<P>
Pizzi, who goes to the Soviet Union to perform next May, said, pointing toward 
his studio, "The great thing is from that little room, I've reached that far. 
That's encouraging. I'll be happy with more of the same, quite frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Pizzi will play tenor saxophone 9 p.m. Sunday at Residuals, 11042 Ventura 
Blvd., Studio City (818) 761-8301, and 9:15 p.m. Jan. 25 at Alfonse's, 10057 
Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake (818) 761-3511. There are no cover charges for 
either sets.

DRUGS, GANG VIOLENCE BLAMED FOR 50% JUMP IN INGLEWOOD MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An upswing in gang violence and drug dealing caused Inglewood's murder rate to 
rise 50% last year, making 1989 the second-deadliest year in the city's 
history, according to year-end estimates released last week by the Inglewood 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported 46 murders in Inglewood last year, compared to the record 55 
reported in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of shootings involving Inglewood police officers 
more than tripled, rising from three in 1988 to 11 in 1989 and pushing the city 
into third place in Los Angeles County in the number of officer-involved 
shootings. In part, police attributed that increase to gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aggressively attacking gangs and drugs on our streets," Sgt. Harold 
Moret said. "We are going to have police officer-criminal conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
A new Anti-Crime Team funded by a special police tax and specifically aimed at 
reducing gang and drug activity has helped police respond more quickly to calls 
for help, Moret said. "When we get there very quickly, we have more occasion to 
confront armed people committing crimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jose Fernandez said that the number of officer-involved shootings is 
a consequence of officers putting themselves into life-and-death situations. 
"The police are being very proactive in dealing with gangs," Fernandez said. 
"So, of course, that might create situations where confrontations occur. I wish 
there wouldn't be any shootings, but it's difficult being a community next to 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Although saying that most officer-involved shootings are justified, citizen 
activist Terry Coleman called in an interview last week for the creation of a 
police commission to investigate citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"Police work is difficult," said Coleman, a former Los Angeles police officer 
now on disability. "It's not that the police aren't doing their job, but I'd 
like to see a strong police commission in this city so officers are judged by 
their peers and then by the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the 11 officer-involved shootings in Inglewood resulted in deaths. 
</P>
<P>
With the increase, Inglewood ranks behind only the much-larger Los Angeles 
Police Department and county Sheriff's Department in officer-involved 
shootings. According to the district attorney's office, in 1989, Los Angeles 
police were involved in 65 officer-involved shootings, while the Sheriff's 
Department had 30. Behind Inglewood were police departments in Long Beach (9), 
Torrance (3) and Santa Monica (3) and the California Highway Patrol (3). 
</P>
<P>
Other South Bay law-enforcement agencies with officer-involved shootings in 
1989 were Gardena, Hawthorne, Los Angeles Airport and Redondo Beach, which had 
one each. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 46 murders in Inglewood in 1989, 22 were connected to gang or drug 
activity, six to domestic disputes or child abuse, five to robberies, four to 
fights that escalated to murder, and one to a sex crime. Murders in all 
categories rose from 1988, with those in the gang and drug activity category 
showing the largest increase. The remaining eight were classified as "other" or 
"unknown." 
</P>
<P>
The first murder of the year occurred when an Israeli cab driver who picked up 
a fare at Los Angeles International Airport was shot by a passenger while 
driving through Inglewood to Los Angeles. The final murder victim was a 
19-year-old Los Angeles gang member whose car broke down in Inglewood, where he 
was shot in the chest by rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
After Inglewood's record of 55 murders was set in 1980, the rest of the decade 
fluctuated between 21 and 32 murders per year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 46 murders last year, there were six other deaths judged 
justifiable homicides. Only one death has not yet been classified pending 
investigation: Patrick Shanahan, a teen-ager who died in police custody outside 
a Grateful Dead concert last month. 
</P>
<P>
Complete crime statistics for 1989 are still being compiled, although police 
estimate that the overall crime rate may have risen 10%. 
</P>
<P>
OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTINGS 
</P>
<P>
These police agencies had the most officer-involved shootings in Los Angeles 
County during 1989. The approximate number of sworn officers in each department 
is in parentheses. 
</P>
<P>
1. Los Angeles Police Department (7,900): 65 
</P>
<P>
2. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (7,000): 30 
</P>
<P>
3. Inglewood Police Department (185): 11 
</P>
<P>
4. Long Beach Police Department (650): 9 
</P>
<P>
5. Torrance PD (240), Santa Monica PD (150) and California Highway Patrol 
(1,040): 3 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these South Bay police agencies had one officer-involved shooting: 
Gardena (80), Hawthorne (80) and Redondo Beach (110).

FIRETRUCK ESCAPES BROKEN-DOWN RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither blistering fires, daring rescues nor hair-raising dashes to the scene 
could keep Torrance's sturdy firetruck No. 103 from its appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But, at last, after years of faultless service, it began to look as if old age 
would force the Fire Department to turn the trusty red truck into a playground 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The thought depressed the men who had served on it. So when the Los Angeles 
County Fire Museum Assn. offered to restore No. 103 to its previous glory and 
give it a new home, Torrance Fire Department officials jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of dismantling the 1954 Mack firetruck and putting the sad 
skeleton in a Wilson Park playground as the city had planned, fire officials 
will be able to give No. 103 a dignified retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials are expected to pick up their prize within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly a little bedraggled after sitting in the city's maintenance yard 
since being retired from reserve service about a year ago, the 23,000-pound 
engine once was the pride of the department. 
</P>
<P>
"When it came out, it was the Cadillac of all apparatus," Battalion Chief 
Harlan Treskes said. "Now it's so old and obsolete, you can't even get parts to 
repair it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though getting new (engines) with better technology is nice, there are a 
lot of memories and emotions that go with those old pieces," he said. "We're 
glad to see it preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 25 feet long, the fire engine, with its 1,250-gallon-per-minute pump, 
fought such famous blazes as the 1958 Riviera Club fire, in which the swank 
beach club burned to the ground, and two fires at the same restaurant, which 
first burned as the Tahitian, and then went up again as Calamity Jane's. 
</P>
<P>
No. 103, which spent its career based at the city's Calle Mayor fire station, 
also helped fight countless brush fires on the Palos Verdes Peninsula when 
those cities called for help. 
</P>
<P>
Fire museum officials said they will move the engine to a county fire station 
in Paramount where they will restore it. The association hopes to get a 
permanent museum building for its collection of 17 vintage fire vehicles, which 
are now stored all over the county. 
</P>
<P>
A small county building at 1320 N. Eastern Ave. in an unincorporated area east 
of Los Angeles serves as museum headquarters. It is open to the public on the 
third Sunday of each month from noon to 4 p.m. The building's size forces them 
to show only two or three engines and a few smaller displays of vintage badges, 
helmets and other fire paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
The current collection, which rotates through the museum, ranges from a 1913 
Model T fire engine to the 1973 Dodge paramedic van that was named Squad 51 in 
the defunct television series "Emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Museum Assn. President Terry Lee, a captain at the county Fire Department's 
Lakewood station, said his group hopes to use the antique fleet as the basis 
for a future West Coast Fire Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these things at one point were so old they were worthless" but after a 
while "they start to appreciate in value because you can't find them anymore," 
Lee said. "We'd like to save one of everything so people can see how we've 
progressed." 
</P>
<P>
Once restored, Torrance Engine No. 103 will be rotated into the museum's 
changing displays. 
</P>
<P>
"For a time, Mack was the No. 1 fire engine," Lee said. "We're glad to have 
one."

LOYOLA STEPS ON THE GAS, HOLDS OFF USD

<P>
What, Paul Westhead worry? 
</P>
<P>
Nah. 
</P>
<P>
The man has seen a lot of baskets in his five years at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
So there was little cause for concern when exuberant, upset-minded University 
of San Diego began pressing his 23rd-ranked Lions Saturday night in front of a 
standing-room-only crowd listed at 2,500 in the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the pace was furious and the score high, Westhead was happy. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount usually wins these games, and Saturday was no different. The 
final: Loyola Marymount 119, USD 112. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Lions' fourth consecutive victory, their second in the West Coast 
Conference. The 11-3 start equals their best ever. In 1987-88, Loyola started 
10-3 and also defeated USD in the 14th game. They did not lose again until the 
second round of the NCAA Tournament and finished 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which dropped its second in a row after a three-game winning streak, fell 
to 6-9 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that pace. I knew we were all right because the score was so high," 
said Westhead, who added that his team did not play up to potential. 
</P>
<P>
"Sub-par," Lion forward Bo Kimble said. "I know we can play a lot better, but 
we've got to hand it to San Diego. They played well. They had us scouted well. 
They were prepared." 
</P>
<P>
USD did play well but lost to the Lions for the fifth time in a row. In each, 
Loyola has scored more than a 100 points. The Lions, second in the nation in 
scoring with a 117.6 average going in, hit 100 for the 12th time in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so unique that they make it hard for you to adjust," USD Coach Hank 
Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers led all scorers with 32 points, the first time he has led the 
Lions in scoring since a fainting incident Dec. 9 against UC Santa Barbara. Bo 
Kimble, the nation's scoring leader, was nine under his season average with 28 
points. Jeff Fryer added 19. 
</P>
<P>
Dondi Bell had a career-high 20 points for USD. Craig Cottrell had 18 and John 
Jerome and Wayman Strickland 17 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
USD raced to an early lead, scoring the first six points as LMU missed its 
first four shots. The Toreros held the advantage until Per Stumer made a 
three-pointer with 12:20 left, giving the Lions their first lead, 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
LMU took a 34-27 lead with 8:45 left, but two Craig Cottrell layups, a Dondi 
Bell five-footer and a Kelvin Woods layup, sandwiched around a Kimble basket, 
pulled USD to within 36-35. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Wayman Strickland tied it, 41-41, with a pair of free throws. 
But Kimble quickly answered with a three-pointer to put LMU back on top. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, the Lions rallied for nine consecutive points and took their 
biggest lead before halftime, 56-45, with 2:30 left. But two baskets each by 
Cottrell and Dondi Bell pulled USD within eight. 
</P>
<P>
After LMU's John O'Connell made one of two free throws, USD's Gylan Dottin got 
his first two points, free throws with two seconds left, to end the first-half 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated efforts by USD to slow the pace -- Egan called four timeouts 
in the first half -- the point totals were easily the most scored and allowed 
by USD this season. 
</P>
<P>
USD got to within five a number of times in the second half, but Loyola 
Marymount eventually built a double-digit lead with about five minutes left. 
The Toreros scored the last nine points. 
</P>
<P>
As is normal when the Lions play, there were a number of spectacular sequences. 
Similar flying left-hand slams by Kimble were two of the better ones. The 
first, at 14:27 of the second half, came off a long pass from Tom Peabody. The 
second came seconds later after a USD turnover. Bell had a pair of decent 
two-hand slams, but a one-handed Michael Jordan-like jam over an LMU player 
brought the loudest cheer from USD's biggest crowd of the year.

buses for what they know is going to be a trip they'll never forget. 
Destination: Cooperstown, N.Y., and the baseball Hall of Fame. The date circled 
on the calendar is Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The only discouraging development to contend with is a lack of space. Hotels, 
motels, tourist houses and campgrounds are booked solid. There's, literally, no 
room at the inn. Cooperstown has all but run out of rooming accommodations, and 
the ceremony is still six months away. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and Joe Morgan will become the 205th and 206th members to be enshrined 
in the elite body of former players, managers, coaches and executives when they 
receive the most lasting distinction the sport has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore in 1983 was responsible for establishing a new trend at the Hall of 
Fame. Because of what Brooks Robinson meant as a performer and individual, a 
sizable number of natives, a force estimated at 10,000 strong, made the 
pilgrimage to the picture postcard village of Cooperstown. They caused noise 
and attention but demonstrated a dignity befitting the event. 
</P>
<P>
Before Robinson's entry into the Hall of Fame, the crowds had been coming every 
year for the annual festivities, but the turnout was modest. The proceedings 
were staged in front of the Hall of Fame building. Bands played and emotional 
speeches brought both cheers and tears. The recipients and spectators were 
impressed. But the numbers weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown, rimmed with the beauty of a pristine countryside and reflections 
from the clear waters of Ostego Lake, was read about by millions of interested 
fans in newspaper dispatches and linked with the origin of baseball. But, in 
truth, the masses didn't necessarily lend a physical presence. All that has 
changed. Now it's more of a social and athletic happening -- the place to be 
the first weekend of August. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinson visit touched off a celebration the likes of which Cooperstown had 
never expected. And, in each summer since, the crowds have at least matched the 
Robinson assemblage. Some estimates had from 20,000 to 50,000 present for the 
installation last year when Carl Yastrzemski and Johnny Bench headlined the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
A company Yastrzemski represented took over the Cooperstown Motel, which offers 
37 units. Downtown Cooperstown (population 2,304) was tied in a traffic knot. 
The function has taken on such importance to the fans that they now play 
guessing games and project when their special heroes are going to become 
eligible. Then they make advance reservations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies is presumed to be an almost 
automatic selection. So the Cooperstown Motel, according to owner Al O'Brien, 
has been booked solid in anticipation of a Schmidt election. And outside 
Cooperstown, in all directions, there's a desire to find accommodations in such 
cities as Oneonta, Utica, Binghamton, Syracuse, Albany and points in between. 
</P>
<P>
The good mayor of Cooperstown, the former editor of the town newspaper, is 
Harold H. Hollis, who also serves as the area's official U.S. weather observer. 
An amicable, helpful individual, he is enthusiastic over the economic impact 
that results. "Isn't it reasonable to expect that you can't have a big crowd 
without people opening their pocketbooks?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hollis wonders out loud if Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer is going 
to make the trip, as he did in 1983 for Robinson's "coronation." 
</P>
<P>
"I would sure like to have another invitation to the kind of crab cake 
reception the Baltimore and Maryland delegation put on that time," Mayor Hollis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joseph Collins, president of the Chamber of Commerce, is all aglow 
and ready to accept the host responsibility. "We're going to have what we call 
a 'Molley Trolley,' a conveyance that you ride from some point outside the 
village, where we have perimeter parking. You park your car, say at the school 
grounds, and jump on the 'Molley Trolley.' 
</P>
<P>
"We're gearing up as best we can. You've got to remember that a big place here 
is 10 or 12 rooms. Last year, fans were sleeping in cars all over the place. 
That's not good. Where are we going to put all the people? You have to 
remember, too, that this is a village; not a city." 
</P>
<P>
But what does Collins advise? As the leader of the Chamber of Commerce, he 
suggests you write for an area housing and points-of-interest guide, at a cost 
of $1, which offers a list of options. The appeal of Cooperstown is its natural 
beauty, like turning a history book page back to a time before commercial 
enterprises took over and brought an almost universal look of sameness to 
almost every city, town and village in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown has fought off all attempted invasions by fast-food franchises. It 
has vigorously battled to retain its quaintness and distinctive style. There's 
only one red light, at Main and Chestnut streets, so hustle and bustle is for 
city folk. Not in Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame installation is admission free. An exhibition game between the 
Orioles and Montreal Expos is the next afternoon, Aug. 6, but tickets don't go 
on sale until May 7. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperstown will extend warm hospitality to all. It just can't assure you of a 
place to sleep.

SACRAMENTO: THE CITY OF SPORTS IN 21ST CENTURY

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking back, I can hardly believe it. Used to be I could say things like, "The 
great, the awful, the young, the old -- yup, I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em 
go." 
</P>
<P>
But here, from the vantage point of the year 2024, I can safely say I can't 
remember the last time I saw anyone go. I've just sat here watching this town 
-- been doing it since 1983 -- and all I can say is, "I've seen 'em come and 
come . . . and keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
Remember that scene in "The Ten Commandments" when Charlton Heston (who was, I 
might add, just elected to his second term as U.S. president at age 103) led 
thousands of slaves on the exodus to the Promised Land? Well, that's what it 
was like. Suddenly, everyone in the world seemed to be moving to Sacramento. 
Nothing could stop them. 
</P>
<P>
It began as a trickle in '85, when the Kings packed up and left Kansas City. 
They were the pioneers of The Great Migration, the first ones in. After that, 
for five, six years, no one came. Some people here, thinking no one would come 
again, panicked. It was a bitter time filled with darkness and woe. Later, it 
became known as The Black Lull. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, it didn't last. After Al Davis moved his Raiders to Sacramento in '92, 
the floodgates collapsed. Moving vans and trailers and Range Rovers jammed I-80 
at all hours. The sound of hammers and saws didn't stop for three years as 
stadiums and arenas and practice facilities sprung up all over town. Those of 
us who were around then couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I saw Anne Rudin, who was mayor then, selling sushidogs at a 
concession stand in The Al &amp; Gregg, 2-Gether, 4-Ever, ARCO/Gulf, Western 
&amp; Toshiba Palace of Happiness And Sport the other day, and she told me she 
still hasn't gotten over the shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Other important people visited me," she said, "but they never did. They never 
stopped in to visit. They just brought their teams in without even saying 
hello." 
</P>
<P>
Now, naturally, it's easy to take for granted what we have. But all those teams 
didn't have the easiest time getting here. Take Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
It was '02 or maybe '03 when The Irish dropped roots in town, but it might have 
never happened if Athletic Director Lou Holtz hadn't started to crack. Holtz, 
you should know, went insane in 2012 and was carted away raving that George 
Gipp had been living a lie for the last 90 years. A decade earlier, when he'd 
authorized the move west, he seemed stable. But looking back, I'm not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a list of 100 things I wanted to do before I died," Holtz said then," 
and No. 100 was to move the Fighting Irish to a world-class city. South Bend is 
too small. Everyone calls it a cow town. I'm sick of it. Give me those bright 
lights on the Tower Bridge any day." 
</P>
<P>
As you know, Notre Dame's basketball team was never much. So Gregg Lukenbill 
enticed (books and movie rights, that's what I heard) Indiana's hoopsters and 
their incendiary coach B. Knight -- who in 1997 insisted on shortening his 
first name from Bob to "B" -- to come west. Left the rest of the school in 
Bloomington, though. Luke said their business school was pretty lame. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it wasn't all gravy. We had to take some of the bad with the good, 
too. Like when the Yankees came, Luke had to agree to take the Bronx along with 
them. Yes, we had to fill in the Sacramento River, but so what? We had to have 
some place to put the zoo and Fort Apache and all those bombed-out tenements. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the river, that brings to mind the time Lukenbill first brought 
home the America's Cup. Luke saw what he wanted and went out and got it. 
Piloted a gunboat into San Diego Harbor during the '92 Cup races there and just 
grabbed the Cup, and some lip balm, right out of Dennis Conner's hands. Conner 
started shrieking, but Luke bolted and lost those tri-hulls but fast. 
</P>
<P>
They had to change the race to a cigarette boat sprint and name it the American 
River Cup, but what of it? We've successfully defended it the last four tries. 
</P>
<P>
No rest for the burned-out scribe, though. Just three years later, the A's and 
the Giants merged and moved here, and two years after that, major-league 
baseball decided to expand again by throwing yet another team into Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't stop the tide," baseball Commissioner Angelo Tsakopoulos said then. 
"This is the dawn of the Sacramento Century. We know it. America knows it. 
Three teams for this city may not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that became something of a moot point when one of the members of 
Sacramento's Gang of Omniscient Developers (G.O.D.) -- we won't name names 
here, naturally -- was suspected of fixing an election in San Francisco after 
folks went to bed thinking they'd approved a new, 3,400-seat baseball park for 
the minor-league Minnows and awoke to find they'd agreed to the annexation of 
the Bay Area to Sacramento. Historians are calling it the American Anschluss. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think this whole affair ended with sports. No sir, it began with it. 
Once Michigan Gov. Bo Schembechler approved the move of the entire U.S. auto 
industry to Sacramento in '98, we knew anything could happen. No one even 
blinked when Eastern Hemisphere President Mikhail Gorbachev, looking toward 
Japan, moved his headquarters, lock, stock and sickle, here. 
</P>
<P>
And now there's talk that Lukenbill is negotiating with Rome for the rights to 
St. Peter's Basilica. The deal is close to being done. Just some niggling 
details -- something about changing the name to St. Luke's. 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't progress, I don't know what is.

WOLFPACK'S MONROE STILL PEARL IN HIS MOTHER'S EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minutes after the North Carolina State-Temple game last weekend at Atlantic 
City, N.J., there was a meeting of two generations of the basketball world. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe of the Wolfpack was talking to his mother and another woman when 
two men approached the small group. 
</P>
<P>
One man was Sonny Hill, considered the guru of Philadelphia basketball, and the 
other was Earl "The Pearl" Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Hill approached Rodney Monroe with a smile of recognition and said "I'd like to 
introduce you to your namesake." 
</P>
<P>
"I know who this is," Rodney said shaking Earl's hand. 
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged small talk and words of praise until they were interrupted by 
Rodney's mother, who was holding out a program she wanted the Hall of Fame 
nominee to autograph. 
</P>
<P>
As he signed his name, Monroe, now in the record promotion business, told the 
woman, "You know, I have a son named Rodney." She smiled one of those special, 
motherly looks and said, "Isn't that something?" 
</P>
<P>
You would think the player who led the nation in scoring would be adept at 
picking up a load of points at the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Not so with Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers, who topped the country last season 
at 32.7 points per game while making just 56 percent of his 315 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
That percentage was better than his sophomore mark of 54 percent when he 
averaged 22.5 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Gathers, a right-handed shooter, has been taking his free throws 
left-handed. The difference hasn't been that great. 
</P>
<P>
Through nine games this season, Gathers made 33 of 63, 52 percent, while 
averaging 25 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Against La Salle last weekend, Gathers was 1-for-7 from the line before 
stepping up and making both ends of a 1-and-1 with 10 seconds left to wrap up 
the victory for the Lions in Gathers' hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of work in at the foul line and I give most of the credit goes to 
one of our assistant coaches, Judas Prada, who always grabs me before practice 
and helps me to shoot foul shots," he said. "I feel very confident shooting 
with my left hand. It's more of a natural stroke for me. I think I rushed my 
first few tonight and then really took my time and concentrated on my technique 
on the last two." 
</P>
<P>
When he made the first, Gathers turned and pointed toward the crowd at the 
Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pointing to Father Dave Hagan, a friend of mine from here in Philly, who 
has been on my back since grade school to make free throws," he said. "I was 
really pointing at him and my mom who tells me to make my free throws and to 
always go up and I'll always make it. She's not always right." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount coach Paul Westhead was asked if he had scouted future 
opponent La Salle when it played Temple three night before his Lions were to. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I went to the game but left at halftime. The score was 63-62," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the final score in La Salle's favor, and combined, it was just six 
points less than Westhead's Lions would score in the 121-116 victory, the 
Explorers' first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season began, Indiana coach Bob Knight was more than pleased with 
the coaching staff addition of Don Donoher, who was fired after 25 years at 
Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any college basketball situation, through whatever changes 
that occur -- change in coaches, addition of players, development of players or 
whatever -- has made as good an addition as we have with Donoher," Knight said. 
"I think that Donoher was the best addition that any college team anywhere in 
the country has made this past season." 
</P>
<P>
Knight gave Donoher the bulk of the credit after the Hoosiers rallied from 20 
points down at home for a victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"That was Don Donoher's lineup in the second half," Knight said of the unit 
which turned the tide and took the lead with a 17-0 run late in the game. "He 
said we should go with our most mobile players and to take a chance with them 
on the defensive end to get something going on the offensive end." 
</P>
<P>
The team which got things going in the second half was one with four guards and 
sophomore center Eric Anderson. Most of the comeback was made with at least 
four sophomores or freshmen on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Does Knight always take his assistant's suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
"He was very adamant about it," he said of Donoher. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't really that big a surprise when Nebraska led Kansas by 13 points in 
the second half of the Jayhawks' first game as the No. 1 team in the country in 
32 years. 
</P>
<P>
What was surprising was that the Cornhuskers didn't hold on for the upset as 
Kansas rallied for a 98-93 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska had played three other top-ranked teams in its history and beaten all 
three -- Kansas State in 1958, Michigan in 1964 and Missouri in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Tech beat Western Baptist 137-82 last week and all nine players who saw 
action for Oregon Tech scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman center Tyrone Holmes led the way with 25 points and all eight of his 
teammates had at least 11. 
</P>
<P>
The first week of league play in the Western Athletic Conference was as 
balanced as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
The eight teams which played had 1-1 conference marks, while the ninth team, 
Air Force, was 0-0. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the top 20 scorers last season were underclassmen and they are doing 
very well so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount, who led the nation last season at 32.7, Chris 
Jackson of LSU, Lionel Simmons of La Salle, Bimbo Coles of Virginia Tech, Kurk 
Lee of Towson State and Bailey Alston of Liberty are all in the top 20 in the 
first set of statistics released in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Three others -- Gerald Glass of Mississippi, Raymond Dudley of Air Force and 
John Taft of Marshall -- are all just out of the top 20, while Delaware State's 
Tom Davis' 19.9 points per game is out of the national rankings but still very 
respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, Gathers' teammate, is leading the nation in scoring with 37.4 per 
game. If he can keep that pace up in the Lions' run-and-shoot style, Kimble 
would have the highest mark since Freeman Williams of Portland State led the 
country at 38.8 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky coach Rick Pitino doesn't have to travel far to receive advice on how 
to improve the Wildcats' play. 
</P>
<P>
His 7-year-old son Richard visited his school's library and found a book titled 
"Rupp's Championship Season." 
</P>
<P>
Richard asked his father if he had ever read the book which contains diagrams 
of plays used by Adolph Rupp, the coach at Kentucky for 42 seasons and the 
winningest coach of all-time. 
</P>
<P>
When his father replied he had not seen the diagrams, the youngster said: "Why 
don't use a few. You have lost five in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Textile basketball coach Herb Magee has little more than 
sweatclothes to wear these days after a fire ravaged his apartment building 
recently. All he could salvage was his golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it was arson," said Magee, who recently won his 450th career game. 
He said authorities also believe the fire began in his apartment. "They think 
it was a robber who was trying to cover his tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Magee, grateful nobody was hurt in the fire, is kicking himself for not having 
renter's insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it turns out a lot of people in the complex didn't have it. An 
insurance salesman could have a great day if he went door-to-door there now," 
said Magee, who currently is living with friends. 
</P>
<P>
A master coach of shooting, Magee said he's also grateful to have basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it tough to find a new house, but it's kept me busy."

UC IRVINE REMAINS ON SKID ROW, LOSES, 88-75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the what ifs and could haves boggled the mind Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
What if UC Irvine didn't turn the ball over a season-high 25 times against New 
Mexico State at the Bren Center? What if the Anteaters didn't go flat for five 
minutes late in the game? What if New Mexico State hadn't gone to the free 
throw line 44 times, making 29? 
</P>
<P>
Those things happened and Irvine lost to New Mexico State, 88-75, before 2,248 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Irvine's eighth in a row, three short of the school record of 11 
set 10 years ago. The Anteaters dropped to 2-13 overall, 0-6 in the Big West 
Conference. New Mexico State, leading the conference, is 14-1, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
For an all-too-brief time it appeared as if Irvine might snap out of its 
season-long doldrums and upset the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever New Mexico State seemed ready to pull away, Irvine would rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters cut a 13-point New Mexico State lead to 62-59 with 8:46 to play. 
But after a time out, New Mexico State regained its composure and turned the 
game into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine couldn't hang onto the ball, which contributed to a 15-3 run over the 
next five minutes that gave the Aggies a 77-62 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't shake them," New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy said. "We 
were playing well, but couldn't shake them (until late in the game)." 
</P>
<P>
Center James Anderson played particularly well for the Aggies, hitting all 10 
of his shots from the field for a game-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
He had six points, including a one-handed reverse dunk after a steal at 
midcourt, during the Aggies' big run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not known as a shooter," Anderson said. "But I'm concentrating more." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hill had 14 points, Reggie Jordan 13 and Randy Brown 11 for the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ricky Butler, who made all seven of his shots from the field, had 19 
points and nine rebounds to lead Irvine. Jeff Herdman added 17, Rod Palmer 16 
and Jeff Von Lutzow 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, whose shooting percentage had been hovering around the 40% mark, 
shot 50% for only the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot 50%, but you have to take away 25 possessions," Irvine Coach Bill 
Mulligan said, referring to the 25 turnovers. "You can't turn it over against 
(quick) teams like that." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine did and lost again. 
</P>
<P>
Still, McCarthy was impressed with the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were one of the best shooting teams we've seen," he said. "I thought Bill 
had his team very well prepared to play us." 
</P>
<P>
Early on, Irvine had trouble with the Aggies' full-court press and aggressive 
two-three zone defense. But the Anteaters solved it in the second half, hitting 
three-pointers and forcing McCarthy to abandon the press. 
</P>
<P>
"They were shooting three-pointers out of their minds," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine also made its shots outside, making 10 of 25 three-pointers. Herdman, 
who had his best all-around game in conference play, made four of eight. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think we're getting better," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brett Pagett, a reserve guard, has enrolled at Rancho Santiago College, said 
Bob Olson, Irvine sports information director. Pagett, who is sidelined with a 
foot injury, had not played this season for the Anteaters. . . . Coach Bill 
Mulligan started his 12th different lineup this season, going with Jeff Herdman 
and Don May at forward, Ricky Butler at center, and Justin Anderson and Rod 
Palmer at guard. Butler is the only player to start all 15 games. . . . The 
streaks continue: Irvine has lost 12 of its past 14 games in the Bren Center. 
The Anteaters have lost their past 10 Big West Conference games, dating to 
February 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan on whether New Mexico State should be ranked in the top 25: "Sure, 
don't you guys? But not based on beating us. Beating Nevada Las Vegas and Santa 
Barbara."

PHILLIES' GENERAL MANAGER LOOKS FOR DEALS

<TEXT>

Phillie General Manager Lee Thomas wants to make a deal. But he can't make the 
phone ring. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that I'm trying to swing a deal for pitching," Thomas said 
Wednesday. "I've gone to all the clubs and they know we're looking for a 
pitcher who could be a No. 1 or a No. 2 guy for us. 
</P>
<P>
"They know we're willing to trade value for value. But, unfortunately, they're 
still trying to sell us on the idea that their No. 3 and 4 guys are really No. 
1s or 2s. That's not going to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a pitcher who can go into the rotation either in front of 
Kenny Howell or right behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Among those the Phillies are thought to be dangling for trades are outfielders 
Von Hayes and Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies reportedly have sought California right-hander Kirk McCaskill, who 
was 15-10 last season with a 2.93 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of waiting," Thomas said. "I'm tired of doing all the 
calling. The Angels said they'd get back to me. They said they had a couple of 
things to do. Well, the ball is in their court." 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified National League executive told the Delaware County Daily Times 
of suburban Primos that the Phillies have tried to interest the New York Mets 
in a deal involving Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Phillies dealt second baseman Juan Samuel to the NL East rival 
Mets for Dykstra and reliever Roger McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about another possible deal with the Mets, Thomas said, "It's sad because 
they're the one team I think we might be the most compatible with. But they 
won't budge. I don't know if they're upset about the Samuel deal or what. I 
just can't seem to get much out of them." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel never made it big in New York, asked to be traded after the season and 
was dealt to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies now find themselves loaded with left-handed hitting outfielders, 
but Thomas said he doesn't feel compelled to trade one of them. Besides Dykstra 
and Hayes, the team has John Kruk and Ron Jones, who Thomas hopes has recovered 
from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies also have left-handed batting Curt Ford and right-handed hitting 
Carmelo Martinez in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Kruk and Hayes are going to be everyday guys, and if Lenny is still here he's 
going to lead off and play center field," Thomas said. "And if Jonesy is 100 
percent, I know he's going to be a darned good hitter. He's going to do 
something for somebody, if he's healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"But overall, I think it's a good situation for us. If it's handled in the 
right way, a competitive situation like this can only help our club." 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies on Thursday announced the signing of pitchers Bruce Ruffin and 
Chuck Malone, catcher Tom Nieto and infielder Kim Batiste, leaving the club 
with 26 unsigned players, including nine eligible for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin, who received a $350,-000 deal, and Nieto, who got $127,000, both were 
eligible for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers Don Carman, McDowell, Jeff Parrett and Floyd Youmans; catcher Darren 
Daulton; infielders Steve Jeltz, Randy Ready and Dickie Thon; and outfielder 
Ford have until noon Jan. 16 to file for arbitration. Hearings will be 
scheduled between Feb. 1-20.

BUZZER-BEATER STRIKES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
TITANS: WAYNE WILLIAMS, WHO'S MAKING A HABIT OF IT, HITS A 32-FOOTER AS TIME 
EXPIRES TO BEAT PACIFIC, 76-73.

<TEXT>
<P>
The ball, Wayne Williams said, ended up in the right person's hands. 
</P>
<P>
They were his own. 
</P>
<P>
Dell Demps of the University of the Pacific knew as much as soon as Cedric 
Ceballos tapped the ball away from him and into Williams' grasp in the final 
seconds of Cal State Fullerton's game against the Tigers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he'd made some shots like that before," Demps said. And as Demps 
watched and dreaded, the sophomore -- whose teammates call him Buzzer-Beater -- 
did it again, launching a 32-foot shot that rattled in as time ran out, giving 
Fullerton a 76-73 Big West Conference victory in front of 2,113. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much different from the basket that Williams made to beat Nevada Las 
Vegas at the overtime buzzer last season, only about seven feet farther out and 
at the other end in Titan Gym. And it set off a pandemonium the likes of which 
hadn't been seen in Titan Gym since the victory over UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't one of my better ones," Williams said, "but I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much different from four other buzzer-beating three-pointers that 
Williams has made in a career that is only 41 games old. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman last season, he hit halftime buzzer-beaters that helped spark the 
Titans past UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine, plus, of course, the Rebel-beater 
at the overtime buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he hit a halftime buzzer-beater in a victory against Fresno State 
Thursday. Last week, he missed one against Utah State as the overtime clock ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday, he made one that kept Fullerton out of overtime and spared the 
Titans the possibility of becoming the first conference team to lose to Pacific 
at home since January 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We had this game penciled in as a win," Williams said. "It would have been a 
big disappointment to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (8-5 overall, 2-2 in conference) had led this game by 14 points, but 
almost let it get away. Pacific took a 72-71 lead with 1:18 remaining on two 
free throws by Demps, who led Pacific with 22 points. Anthony Woods, fouled by 
Williams, made the first of a one-and-one with 25 seconds left, but missed the 
second -- one of only two missed free throws by Pacific in the game -- leaving 
the Tigers with a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end, Fullerton tied it on a pressure-packed turnaround jumper with 
11 seconds left by Agee Ward, whose inside touch gave Fullerton 14 points, 
including eight in a row during the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced that all week. I had a lot of confidence," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, Pacific took a timeout, and Fullerton planned to pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't going to let them bring it up easy," Fullerton Coach John Sneed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers inbounded the ball at the far end of the court with Fullerton 
pressing. As Demps crossed halfcourt, Ceballos and Williams converged on him, 
and Ceballos tipped the ball loose with about three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I was careless with the ball and he stripped me," Demps said. "I was too 
concerned about getting a shot off." 
</P>
<P>
Williams saw the loose ball, snatched it up, turned back toward the basket and 
after a few dribbles launched the shot from an angle on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Just your basic high-percentage shot for Williams, who has a bit of trouble 
with layups on occasion and is shooting only 31% from the field. But this kind 
of shot is his thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball happened to go to Wayne Williams," Sneed said. "Vintage Titan, what 
can I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough way to lose for Pacific (9-6, 2-4), a much-improved team over 
last season's 7-21 club. The Tigers, behind Demps and Reggie Ricks, whose 20 
points included six three-pointers, had a chance at an upset against a 
Fullerton team that had its best shooting performance in four years, making 
61.5% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Tigers were beaten by a buzzer-beater. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you don't expect," Coach Bob Thomason said. "It's a shock. It 
was a lucky shot, but sometimes you win games on lucky shots." 
</P>
<P>
Williams says he doesn't practice the shot much, but admitted he tried it 
earlier in the day Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to see if it would go in," Williams said. "It was way short." 
</P>
<P>
With the game on the line, it was right on the mark. It was Williams' third 
three-pointer in three attempts Saturday, giving him 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would work if it was set up," he said. "It was just something 
that needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Ron Caldwell has been suspended from the team indefinitely and 
will not travel to San Jose State, Cal State Long Beach or New Mexico State, 
Coach John Sneed said. "I just decided it was the best thing for the team right 
now," Sneed said. Caldwell and Sneed have had a strained relationship for some 
time, and Sneed suspended Caldwell for one game this season after Caldwell 
didn't follow instructions in practice. Caldwell is averaging 3.2 points a 
game. . . . Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill led Fullerton with 19 points each 
against Pacific and remain tied for the team scoring lead with 21.5-point 
averages. . . . Cal State Disneyland Dept.: Mickey has Minnie, and now 
Fullerton mascot Tuffy Titan has a significant other too. A feminine Tuffy, as 
yet unnamed, made her debut during Saturday's game.

49ERS' CARTER JUST WANTS A CHANCE TO PLAY 
</P>

<P>
Here's what Michael Carter, the San Francisco 49er All-Pro nose tackle and 
Olympic shotput silver medalist, has been doing every weekday the past 11 weeks 
while his teammates have been honing themselves into what might be the finest 
NFL team of the decade: 
</P>
<P>
He'd call his wife around noon from the locker room and ask if she'd had lunch 
yet. She'd say no, so he'd take her to lunch. Then they'd go to a movie or to 
the mall. Later he'd help clean the house and maybe wash some dishes. At 4, 
they'd pick up their two daughters from preschool, make dinner, watch TV, read 
to the children and go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the morning was he still a 49er. He'd get to the 49er training facility 
at 6:30 or 7, ride the stationary bike and lift weights. Maybe he'd visit with 
the team trainer, who'd inspect his sprained foot. Carter left by lunch time. 
No reason to stay around. Even if Carter was able, players on injured reserve 
can't practice with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel like you're not really a part of the team," Carter said. "You have to 
keep setting goals for yourself. You have to keep busy. If you didn't keep 
thinking about the light at the end of the tunnel, you couldn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
When Carter sprained his foot against the Jets on Oct. 29, doctors put him in a 
cast and told him he'd have to wear it four weeks. The 49ers would be playing 
the Giants on Monday Night Football in four weeks. Carter thought of nothing 
but that game. It was his light at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
But when the doctors removed the cast, the foot hadn't healed. Two weeks later 
his foot went into a cast again. That cast, like the first one, would have to 
stay on a month. So now the light at the end of the tunnel was the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors removed the cast Jan. 1, five days before the 49ers' semifinal 
playoff game against the Vikings. The foot still wasn't strong enough for 
Carter to return to practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big letdown," Carter said. "You anticipate something for four weeks 
and then it's not what you expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys, 'Win this one for me so I get a chance to play in the next 
one.' After they won, they said, 'OK, now get your butt out there.' But here I 
am still limping around." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors took X-rays of the foot Wednesday. Carter's status for today's NFC 
championship game against the Rams is still uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to practice for the first time Tuesday but didn't participate in 
drills. He jogged on the sideline and felt sore afterward but not as sore as 
the doctors warned him he would. So he's encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"The last 11 weeks have been a roller coaster that hasn't stopped yet," he 
said. "Normally when you have an injury, you can deal with it, compensate for 
it in some way. But with a foot injury, well, you don't think of a foot injury 
as significant, but if you don't have a foot, you can't walk. You can't run. 
You can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
You can't stand for long periods either. So Carter attended only four 49er 
games while he was out. He knew it wasn't good for him to stand on the sideline 
for three hours, and he didn't want to sit in the stands. He tried that when he 
was injured a few years ago and found it to be more trouble than it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
So he watched his teammates on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't want to watch," he said. "It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the game like a coach, analyzing the 49er defense, picking up on 
his teammates' tendencies, their strengths and weaknesses. On Mondays, young 
defensive players such as Larry Roberts and Charles Haley would corner him for 
his observations. 
</P>
<P>
"The role I took during that time was more of a coach's role," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
If Carter doesn't play today, and the 49ers win, he'll likely be ready for the 
Super Bowl. Lord help the center who faces Carter in his first game back. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make someone pay," he said, smiling. "I'm not worried about being 
out so long. Once the Adrenaline gets going and if your heart's big enough, 
you're going to make something happen."

SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND GEORGE FOREMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By WILLIAM GILDEA, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<DATELINE>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1977 George Foreman went to Puerto Rico to fight Jimmy Young. Foreman 
thought if he won he would get a chance to regain the heavyweight championship. 
It was hot. Extremely hot. The fight was indoors and there was no air 
conditioning. Foreman lost. In the dressing room afterward, a strangeness came 
over Big George -- he may not have been as big as he is now, and certainly not 
as big as he was a couple of years ago when he weighed 315 pounds, but even 
then he was Big George. 
</P>
<P>
No one in the room knew what to make of Big George except that he was very hot, 
very agitated. He walked back and forth, fast. He had a look that said beware. 
Was he stricken with heat prostration? Or some terrifying ache of defeat? Was 
he just plain beaten? Naked and perspiring, he looked like a bear that had 
wandered through a car wash. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't understand him any more than he would have understood if someone 
then and there had told him that on Monday night, Jan. 15, 1990, he would fight 
Gerry Cooney. Gerry who? Big George might have said. Or, But in January 1990 
I'll turn 41 years old. Surely you have the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
No. Bob Arum, who once sold Evel Knievel against the Snake River Canyon, 
believes he has the right man. He guaranteed Foreman and Cooney a reported $1 
million each. People had heard the names. Maybe in the privacy of their homes 
they would pay to peek at a curiosity -- or what some would say is pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman fighting? Cooney's reappearance may be even more improbable. At 33, 
Cooney hasn't fought in 2 1/2 years -- some would say longer. He's put in 12 
rounds total in the last 7 1/2 years. When last seen he was panicked before 
being knocked out by Michael Spinks. Then he looked relieved of misery. 
Foreman-Cooney stretches the concept of seniors boxing. Yet the winner 
(improbability being on a roll) may get a shot, sometime, at Mike Tyson. That's 
what Foreman wants. 
</P>
<P>
But what did Foreman know or care of the future in that dressing room in Puerto 
Rico? He thought he was dying. "Y'all," he screamed, "I'm fixin' to die." 
</P>
<P>
In the retelling, "die" rolled off his tongue in many syllables. "I'm fixin' to 
d-i-i-i-e. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to cool off, because after something like that you can't sit 
down. Whew. Whew." 
</P>
<P>
You could feel his breath when he went "whew" even though he was sitting 
several feet across his hotel room. He is that big a man that his "whew" is 
like the breeze from a fan. 
</P>
<P>
But if Foreman always seemed big, he definitely did not look the way he does 
now. The Foreman of memory or old photographs is a youthful Foreman knocking 
down Joe Frazier six times in two rounds in 1973 to become heavyweight champion 
and some said an imperious George. Or the Foreman getting knocked out by 
Muhammad Ali in Zaire in 1974 and becoming a humbled George. Or the Foreman in 
the dressing room in Puerto Rico who seemed the berserk George. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he's lived to a ripe-enough age so that now he looks the way he does. 
Which is round. He has a shaven round face, a shaven round head, a round body. 
</P>
<P>
As big as he is and as round as he is, you might think he'd look meaner. But he 
has a gentle face. It's a face that's seen things, a worn face and a wise face. 
A nocturnal man, he had the curtains drawn against a sun that cast shimmering 
light on a gray ocean. Still, the room was bright enough to see that this big 
man whose breath you could feel was indeed the George Foreman who fought a 
generation ago when he had hair and thought he was dying young in his dressing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
As he paced that room in Puerto Rico the word "die" crept into his thoughts. "I 
kept trying to push it out," he said. " 'I'm George Foreman,' I said to myself. 
'I got a lot to live for.' And within my thoughts I hear a voice: 'You believe 
in God. Why are you afraid to die?' And I started to feel my life go away from 
me like a smile off your face. 
</P>
<P>
"But I had hid money in a safety deposit box, and had hid the keys to the cars. 
I said: 'I can't die in this dressing room. I have nice homes and I'm in this 
dirty old dressing room. Doesn't even have hot water. And I'm about to die.' I 
walked back and forth faster and faster. I didn't say anything because nobody 
would have believed me. I said to myself, 'I'll make a deal with this voice.' I 
said, 'I'll keep boxing and give money to charity, for cancer.' And I heard 
this voice say" -- and this he said from deep within his cavernous body -- " 'I 
don't want your money. I want you!' " 
</P>
<P>
Hearing that, Big George felt his legs give out. He fell "into a deep dark 
nothing, just like in a sea. All I can remember is this hopelessness, this 
nothing, and a horrible smell that went along with this nothing. Like a big 
dump yard of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The people in the room lifted him -- imagine! -- back on to the table. Foreman 
sighed at the recollection. 
</P>
<P>
When he regained consciousness that night in Puerto Rico, all the faces were 
looking down at him. He said, "I'm dying for God." He heard somebody say, 
"Champ, it's all right." And: "Don't worry, Champ, you'll win another fight." 
</P>
<P>
Eight men couldn't hold him down. He leaped into the shower and shouted 
"hallelujah." 
</P>
<P>
The others approached him warily. In time they coaxed him to a hospital. 
Nothing was found wrong with him although he came to realize that given a 
choice of dying for the Lord or living for Him, he'd rather live. "This little 
monitor thing kept going ding, ding, ding. I kept thinking, 'If that thing 
stops dinging, I'm dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
He went home to Houston happy, happier even than when he threw his hands into 
the air after he'd become heavyweight champion of the world. He'd found God, 
but he didn't plan to do anything about it. He didn't plan to retire from 
boxing. He didn't plan to become a street preacher. He just felt contented. But 
the feeling that he should do something kept growing. So he told his 
church-going sister Gloria about this feeling and she referred him to 
Revelation. He said, "Where is that?" 
</P>
<P>
All he knew was that things were different with him. He wasn't the street kid 
of Houston's tough north side Fifth Ward who wanted to have a scar across his 
face so he'd be admired. Or who wanted to do time in prison and come back so he 
would be admired even more. (He managed neither, but sometimes wore a bandage 
on his face as if he had a scar to hide.) 
</P>
<P>
Nor was he the George Foreman who got rich quick and owned more cars than he 
sometimes knew he had. "I had five houses and each house needed at least two 
cars." He also owned a lion and a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
"The lion attacked me once. I was trying to save my brother from the lion, and 
this animal that I had raised from a baby and had hugged and squeezed -- he was 
about 400 pounds -- he jumped off the ground and his teeth came up like big 
knives. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed with all of my might. And I swung. I missed him and spun all the 
way around. And I don't know whether I scared him or I was out of his 
territory, but he stopped dead in his tracks." The lion even went back into the 
cage. Big as he was, Big George felt a great relief. Worry about fighting 10 
rounds with Gerry Cooney? "As long as you stand up to a lion, you're no longer 
fearful of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He had passed from his second adolescence into a new epoch. He opened the 
George Foreman Youth and Community Center. He became pastor of the 
non-denominational Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. He preached in the stadium 
in Africa where he had lost to Ali. This time no one booed him. 
</P>
<P>
People around Houston invited him into their homes to talk with troubled loved 
ones. His trouble was his appetite. Invariably he was invited to stay for 
dinner. He doesn't remember declining an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"George, you want some more chicken?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, just one more piece." 
</P>
<P>
He ate so much sometimes he'd have to undo the button at his waist and pull his 
shirt down low. 
</P>
<P>
His was a familiar face at fast food drive-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you go, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he'd order the menu, as if he was ordering for a lot of people. He'd 
eat on the west side of Houston, and drive and eat his way to the east side of 
Houston. "It was like a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
Big George put on bib overalls.

"There was no stoppin' then. There was no belt." 
</P>
<P>
By 1986 he realized he needed more money because he had sunk so much into the 
youth center and he wanted to educate his eight children (he has three boys, 
all named George, so including him there's the Four Georges) and he wanted to 
keep living in a comfortable style (although without a lion). He tried on his 
boxing trunks. They didn't fit. He ran some and boxed some and then . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a scale, a state-of-the-art scale. When I jumped on it, it spoke to 
me. It said, 'Three-oh-five.' I said, 'Liar.' I took the scale back. I went and 
bought a real scale that didn't talk. I said, 'I'm not going to get on this for 
a long time.' " 
</P>
<P>
One day he put on his boots to run and told his wife, Joan, to pick him up 10 
miles out from their home in the Houston suburb of Humble. By the time she came 
along he'd already run the road and circled back toward home. She was 
surprised. Eventually, his new scale read 296. He'd dropped under 300 for the 
first time in 10 years. For his return to the ring in March 1987, he weighed 
267. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped a man named Steve Zouski in four rounds in Sacramento. Some people 
thought he should fight in, say, an Alaskan hinterland where there might not be 
a cameraman. But as he won 19 straight against a lot of Zouskis, he was 
revealed on taped highlights of TV sports shows. People laughed. 
</P>
<P>
After one fight he called home and got his oldest daughter Michi, l7. 
</P>
<P>
"How'd I look, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
"Daddy, I thought I had the wrong station because I thought it was sumo 
wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
But Big George felt good about himself. "I was having the private laugh of my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For this comeback Foreman called up the guys who are with him now. Among them: 
Archie Moore, "The Old Mongoose," swift and clever, who fought until he was 49 
or 52 (it's his secret), who was 36 or 39 when he won the light heavyweight 
championship, who is either 73 or 76, who taught George tricks of punching as 
long ago as the late '60s after George had won his Olympic gold medal; a 
retired welterweight and a trickster himself, Charlie Shipes, the trainer; 
Brent (Bruiser) Bowers, a roly-poly sparring partner who's a pipe-fitter and 
has written a screenplay and dreams of Sylvester Stallone playing the lead; the 
6-foot-7, 290-pound Mike White, who looks like a pivotman for the Detroit 
Pistons and once was for Eastern Kentucky University, who imitates Cooney and 
who has experienced being hit on top of his head by the 6-foot-3 Foreman who 
reached up, swung down and bounced him off the canvas like a ball. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Clancy, who once trained Foreman but had retired to being a television 
analyst, is back -- but training Cooney. Foreman isn't too worried. "When you 
look at Gil Clancy," he said, "you look at years of caution. Years of pouring 
it into a bucket. You can't pour it out in a second. So Gerry Cooney's going to 
be overwhelmed with caution. What I'm going to try to do is make him be what he 
is, Gerry Cooney, the puncher. And he'll be proud of himself even if he should 
last only minutes." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for what is billed as "The Preacher and the Puncher" -- or, 
unofficially, "The Geezers at Caesars," even though the fight is not at Caesars 
-- Foreman has found his friends to be a great help and joy. For instance, a 
few days before he fought Bobby Crabtree in Springfield, Mo., in September 
1987, Foreman got word: Bobby Crabtree is a southpaw. Foreman had trained for a 
right-hander. "Go check him out, Brent," he said to Bruiser Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers went to the lobby. "May I have your autograph please?" And Crabtree 
obliged, taking the pen and signing with his left hand. Bowers felt his heart 
skip. He hurried back to Foreman's room. 
</P>
<P>
"Champ. Champ. He's a southpaw." 
</P>
<P>
"Pull out of this fight," someone said. 
</P>
<P>
Big George sat to think. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaaah, forget it," he said. "I'm all ready." 
</P>
<P>
Foreman stopped him in six. Showed him his own right-hand jab. "He weaved," 
laughed Foreman, "and weaved right into my left hook. That was the unveiling of 
me being tricky too." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of tricks, here came Moore padding down an aisle and up to a ring, 
preceding Foreman downstairs to a workout. He wore a purple beret. Another 
older man was waiting for him. "Hey, Archie." 
</P>
<P>
Moore squinted into the dim light. The two walked toward each other. "Hey, 
Robert, is that you?" 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Head. He'd come down from Harlem on a bus. They held hands. In the 
'30s the two sparred. "Everytime Archie came into Indianapolis, they couldn't 
get anyone but me to step in with him. He was 155 when I met him and I was 
130." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, George," said Moore, "meet somebody. We were fighting the same year, 
1937." 
</P>
<P>
Moore knew Jack Johnson. His idol was Kid Chocolate. He fought almost 
everywhere and everybody. He lost to Rocky Marciano. He was 45 or 48 when he 
lost to Ali in 1962. This was after he had taught Ali. Already a pro, Ali came 
to Moore's 120-acre training camp outside of San Diego which he called "The 
Salt Mine." 
</P>
<P>
"One day I wanted to test his stamina. There was a hill, straight up. I said, 
'Run up that hill and come back.' Da-da-da-da-da. He was up and back. The guy 
wasn't even breathing. He said, 'Want me to run up again?' 
</P>
<P>
"I took him into the gymnasium and let him strike the bag. He hit the bag but 
he didn't hit it properly. I said, I know what I have to do. I have to show him 
how to throw punches underneath and stuff like that. I didn't want to give it 
to him all in one day. I had him washing dishes and straightening up his bed. 
He said, 'First time anybody made me straighten up my bed and wash dishes.' We 
laugh about that to this day." 
</P>
<P>
There's laughter in the Foreman camp too. Who hadn't been around enough to know 
the worth of the moment?

CYPRESS ON TARGET, ROUTS OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cypress College men's basketball team shot 81% in the first half Saturday 
on the way to a 78-55 Orange Empire Conference victory over Orange Coast at 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers made 17 of 21 shots and used a trapping press to take a 44-23 at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast had a bye Wednesday and Cypress Coach Don Johnson figured the 
Pirates would be a little slow in reacting. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a bye you get to practice more, but it had been a week since 
they (OCC) played a game," Johnson said. "We thought they might be a little 
soft and not ready for a press." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure defense resulted in 10 turnovers, seven of which the Chargers 
converted into baskets in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' shooting percentage didn't drop much in the second half, when the 
Chargers made 14 of 22 shots (64%). Cypress shot 72% (31-43) from the field, 
including four of six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' shooting was worse from free throw line than from the field. The 
Chargers made 60% (12 of 20) of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they played well," OCC Coach Tandy Gillis said. "But we turned the ball 
over too much. We gave them 14 points in the first half otherwise we are only 
down by seven." 
</P>
<P>
Vince Hizon scored 20 points to lead first-place Cypress (18-3 overall, 4-0 in 
conference). It was the fourth time in four conference games that Hizon has 
been Cypress' leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Pauley and Grayle Humphrey each scored 15 for Cypress. Andre Lamoureux 
came off the bench to add 11 for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley made seven of nine field goals, Hizon connected on six of 10, and 
Humphrey was six of eight, including two of three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Also for Cypress, Lamoureux was five-of-five from the field, and Brian Kenney 
and Mike Renaud each were three-of-three. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Schlines led Orange Coast (12-6, 1-2) with 20 points. He was the only 
Pirate in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
OCC made a slight run in the second half, getting to within 11 at, 48-37, with 
14:35 left. But Humphrey made a three-pointer with 13:40 left to push Cypress 
ahead by 14. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 87, Golden West 83 -- The score was tied, 83-83, with about a 
minute to go, but Rancho Santiago made four free throws to clinch the victory 
at Golden West. Corie Blount made both ends of a one-and-one and Mike Hunter 
and Cameron Terry made front ends of one-and-ones for Rancho Santiago (20-1, 
3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Matt Lein led Rancho Santiago with 19 points. Gene Altimarano had 18 points, 
Terry had 17, including five steals, and Blount had 16. Kevin Andersen led 
Golden West with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Alex Kreps had 19 points for Golden 
West (15-8, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 69, Fullerton 62 -- Deon Robinson and Greg Stienstra each scored 19 
points to lead host Riverside (13-10, 2-2). Robinson also had a team-high eight 
rebounds. Rashone Lewis, who had a team-high eight rebounds, and Darryl Griffin 
each scored 14 points and Kenny Cross had 12 for Fullerton (9-12, 0-3).

Debbie Fischer tied the state record for most three-point baskets in a season, 
hitting three Saturday night to raise her total to 66, but her Edison team lost 
to Marina, 55-45, in a Sunset League girls' basketball game at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Melisa Sortino had 28 points to lead Marina, which improved to 14-4 overall and 
3-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer finished with just 11 points, due at least in part to Yorke's 
man-to-man defense against her. Yorke had six steals to go with to her 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Edison is 9-5 and 1-2.

VALLEY UPENDS GLENDALE TO CONTINUE SURGE IN WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Valley College basketball team was a menagerie of personalities early this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries and illnesses to key players made for some interesting lineup 
combinations and substitution patterns but didn't do much for consistency. 
</P>
<P>
Valley players got healthy -- and apparently got themselves together 
collectively -- when they opened play in the Western State Conference two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Valley, the Monarchs stayed unbeaten in the WSC with an 82-69 
victory over Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Valley improved to 13-8 overall and 4-0 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, who on Wednesday snapped two-time defending conference champion 
Santa Monica's 29-game WSC win streak, now sit alone at the top of the Southern 
Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're playing as a team," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said of his players. 
"They've found themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs were in a tight game midway through the second half against 
Glendale when guard Andre Harrell spurred the run that put the game out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, a redshirt sophomore who played at Inglewood High and West Los Angeles 
College, scored seven of his 18 points during a 10-2 run that began with 8 
minutes, 49 seconds left. The Monarchs led, 72-63, when they called timeout 
with 5:15 left and went into a spread offense that pared time off the clock and 
also seemed to sap Glendale of any comeback hope. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (14-8, 2-2), which had beaten College of the Canyons in overtime on 
Wednesday, found itself unable to hit the open shot down the stretch against 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell that their will was a lot stronger to win the game than ours 
was," said Glendale forward David Swanson, who scored a game-high 20 points for 
the Vaqueros. "That's the first time that's happened to us in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Valley forward Steve Ward scored a game-high 27 points for the Monarchs. 
Forward Shawn DeLaittre added 11. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Heicke had 14 points for Glendale while Gary Fowler and Justin Lord added 
13 and 10 points, respectively, for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
Valley was down by nine points early in the first half when the Monarchs 
launched a 9-0 run that helped them to a 36-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Valley trailed, 21-12, when Ward hit a jump shot and Shelton Boykin followed 
with two baskets. Erik McDaniels' three-point shot tied the score, 21-21, with 
10:20 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale led, 35-32, with 2:03 left when DeLaittre made a basket and free throw 
for a three-point play.

RED-HOT CERRITOS MAKES EL CAMINO RED-FACED, 102-78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who were the imposters wearing El Camino's blue uniforms last night in the 
Cerritos College gym? 
</P>
<P>
Whoever they were, they couldn't shoot, play defense for long or hang on to the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
Difficult to believe it was the real McCoy. The Warriors, who defeated Cerritos 
by 12 points in mid-November, couldn't come closer than a 15-point deficit 
against the defending state champions in the second half of Saturday's South 
Coast Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an embarrassing 102-78 loss to the unranked Falcons, who have 
only one returning starter from last year's championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos improved its record to 14-10 and 1-1 in the SCC, while El Camino fell 
to 16-6, 1-2 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" asked El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "Don't look at me. I 
don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Poor shooting (26 of 70 in the game) and an array of costly turnovers put the 
Warriors behind, 50-32, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The problems started midway through the first half, when El Camino fell behind 
17-27 after a two-minute dry spell that included bricks from the entire crew. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Warriors had a 3 1/2-minute scoreless period that put them behind, 
38-19, after a pair of free throws by Cerritos' Edgar Loera with 5:58 left to 
the break. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, things only got worse for El Camino, whose defense proved 
ineffective against Cerritos' lethal outside shooting. Falcon sophomore guard 
Doug Newby had 20 points in the first half, including six of six 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos' lead only got bigger as the second half got under way. Russ May's 
10-foot jumper put the Falcons ahead, 67-42, with 12:34 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
David Keeter's three-point shot followed by Larry Lockley's lay-in with 3:03 
remaining shaved the lead to 15, but hopes of a Warrior comeback were long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
In four years in the SCC, El Camino has never beat Cerritos at home, but Falcon 
Coach Jack Bogdanovich never thought his club could defeat the seventh-ranked 
Warriors by this much. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got up on them," he said. "Last time we tried that it didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Keeter led El Camino with 25 points and Lockley had 22.

SECOND-HALF SLUMP BEATS DOMINGUEZ HILLS TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too bad basketball games don't last just 20 minutes. If that were the case, 
then Cal State Dominguez Hills wouldn't be looking from the bottom up in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nor would the Toros be 4-11 overall. Dominguez Hills has held halftime leads 
nine times this season, but has gone on to win only four, including a pair of 
CCAA openers this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Both an overtime loss Friday at Cal Poly Pomona (69-63) and one in regulation 
Saturday at UC Riverside (66-54) fit what is becoming a painful pattern for 
Toro followers: A gutty, freshmen-dominated Dominguez Hills grabs the pace of 
the game early and edges away with consistent play to control the halftime 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros seem to be OK, too, in the first six minutes of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
But then the roof slowly caves in. A freshman turnover here, a three-point 
basket by an opponent there. Center Joseph Janney drops a rebound out of bounds 
and point guard Robert Barksdale, who holds the team together with his 
offensive moves, tires. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Dominguez Hills trails and a comeback falls short. 
</P>
<P>
It's a familiar scenario, yet one that Coach Dave Yanai had difficultly 
explaining Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very well, I give credit to Riverside," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Coach John Masi credited Yanai with doing the best he can with the 
starless line-up he has had to operate with this year, including three freshmen 
and a sophomore who play most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Masi said he thinks he knows why the Toros can't build on their halftime 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably because it has happened so many times before about the same time in 
the game, they are probably thinking about it happening and then it does. 
That's a big factor." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills led at the half, 31-28, against Riverside. Against Pomona, 
Dominguez Hills led 37-33. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in their second-half troubles has been the Toros' inability to 
control the baseline. Against Riverside, the Toros allowed the Highlanders 11 
baskets off offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yanai: "We're skinny kids. . . . We get overmatched on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, as Barksdale goes, so go the Toros. He scored 33 points Friday 
night, two short of the school record, but was held scoreless in the final 13 
minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night was much the same. Barksdale had three assists and 13 points at 
the half but barely touched the ball in the final 20 minutes. He finished with 
20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Masi said he made an adjustment on Barksdale at the half, and he predicted that 
other teams in the CCAA will begin to guard him more closely as the season 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"When you handle the ball and shoot the ball that much, you are bound to get a 
little weary," Masi said. "They need to get a sub just for him so he can 
(rest). It will get worse for him down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Chris Ceballos came off the bench Saturday to score 25 points to lead 
the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game, Dominguez Hills erased a 24-21 deficit with a 16-2 scoring 
run in the second half, then cruised to a 61-53 victory over Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Vanlandingham, with 18 points and 11 rebounds, and Brigitte Frazier, 
with 12 points and 11 rebounds, keyed the win. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Toros, who lost their CCAA opener, 78-50, on Friday night at Cal Poly 
Pomona, raised their overall record to 9-7.

HOWARD LYON'S COACHING LEGACY AT BIOLA: 400-PLUS WINS AND A BIG HEART; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AT 61, HOWARD LYON IS AN INTERIM COACH NOW. THIS MAY BE HIS 
LAST SEASON. THE EAGLES ARE STRUGGLING. BUT THE RESPECT HE HAS EARNED FROM HIS 
PEERS AND GIVEN TO HIS PLAYERS WILL ENDURE. 
</P>

<P>
It was a stern look that crossed the face of Coach Howard Lyon at a recent 
Biola University basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
"Darn it," he said after a missed free throw, tugging at his ear lobe. "Come 
on, Jim." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Lyon, pacing in front of the Eagle bench, stamped his 
foot, but not a bad word crossed his lips. 
</P>
<P>
In his 35th -- and probably final -- year of coaching, Lyon is watching Biola 
struggle. The school, which won NAIA-record 39 games in 1981-82, is well below 
.500 now. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon has had only one other losing season, so it seems ironic that his last 
team may be the most difficult to direct. Because of injuries and graduation, 
Biola has no starters back from a team that was 29-8 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lyon's legacy, if he does not return next season, is more likely to be his 
big heart, not his last won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard has a real interest in people," said former Biola Vice President Robert 
Fischer, a resident of Rancho Palos Verdes. "He doesn't just look at them as 
players on his team but as people and how he can help them in their 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon, 61, has more than 730 wins. More than half of those have been at Biola, a 
2,000-student Christian College Coalition university in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Biola in 1971 after stints at Avalon, Poly and Millikan high 
schools. In 17 high school seasons, Lyon posted a 325-133 record. In 1970, 
Millikan won its first Southern Section 4-A title under Lyon. Teams he coached 
entered the playoffs 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
Said retired Long Beach City College Athletic Director Del Walker, who was 
Lyon's "B" basketball coach at Poly High: "Howard had an excellent record. 
Every place he's gone he has been successful." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon "retired" at the conclusion of the 1987-88 season after Biola posted a 
31-5 record, yet failed to win the District 3 title. Dave Holmquist, who spent 
nine seasons as Biola's co-coach with Lyon, took over, and the Eagles regained 
the district title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Then last spring, Holmquist became the school's first full-time athletic 
director. That opened the door a crack for Lyon, albeit as an interim coach -- 
a chance he relished. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed coaching last year," he said, "although at times I thought it was the 
best for Biola." 
</P>
<P>
Holmquist said Biola will search for a new coach this spring. Lyon admitted 
that his future is bleak in the current job market. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age, it would be very hard for anyone to look at me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmquist and Lyon spent nine years together as co-coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"With Holmquist, we immediately jumped to a national contender," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregarious in a conservative way, Lyon was, nevertheless, the unflappable soul 
of the team. Holmquist, a quiet, intense person, perhaps provided the spark. 
They won more than 80% of the games their teams played. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard's style is not one of demanding intensity, but one of players seeing 
him work," Holmquist said. "His work ethic kind of rubs off on them, and that 
attitude carries over to their play." 
</P>
<P>
As Biola succeeded, winning five District 3 titles, Holmquist became the more 
visible of the pair. That fueled the notion that Lyon held a title, not a real 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Cal State Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai, whose teams play Biola at 
least twice each year: "(The Biola coaching situation) was strength added to 
strength. Dave was the more outgoing, fiery kind of guy. Howard was more 
reserved, steady. It's never easy with two head coaches, but that will tell you 
about Howard. To be able to submerge egos (for the sake of a team)." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon's future does not ruffle him. 
</P>
<P>
"My original intention was to come back for one year," Lyon said, somewhat 
close to the vest. "I would like to stay here. . . . But I'm not sure about the 
Biola situation." 
</P>
<P>
He will be missed, opposing coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard is a very, very humble man," said Yanai of Dominguez Hills, who has 310 
career wins in 22 years of coaching. "He has tremendous integrity. In my mind, 
he is an excellent basketball coach too." 
</P>
<P>
In 18 seasons at Biola, Lyon has been a good-will ambassador for the university 
as well as a good coach. The Biola basketball team has played in places such as 
Guatemala, China and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
A Long Beach native, Lyon turned down the first offer he had to coach here, in 
the late 1960s, because "I didn't think I was ready (for college)." 
</P>
<P>
But after he was named coach of a state high school all-star team -- a group 
that included players such as Jamaal (then Keith) Wilkes -- Lyon changed his 
mind about his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pretty good thing going at Millikan, about the best situation you 
could ask for as a coach," he said. In 1971, Lyon posted a 17-11 record at 
Millikan. But he jumped at another offer to step up to Biola. 
</P>
<P>
The college not only offered a change, but its philosophy matched his devoutly 
religious life style. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at (life)," he said. "you will either be with the Lord 
eternally, or with the devil. I figured there are a lot of athletes out there 
that want to grow spiritually as well as in basketball, and I felt I could 
contribute to Biola having a strong program." 
</P>
<P>
Holmquist, who played for Lyon at Biola in 1971-72, said a key Lyon trait is 
his even keel. 
</P>
<P>
"His style is steady, consistent, not too much up or down," Holmquist said. 
"That has a calming influence on people, and because of that he was 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Lyon places his coaching philosophy on two different planes: personal 
development of the athlete and reversing the ball, a basketball technique that 
requires a lot of passing and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
"Move the ball," he said. "If you don't, pretty soon players will say, 'I'm 
going to shoot this thing or I'll never see it again.' If you reverse (move) 
the ball, it opens up holes and more people get involved in the game." 
</P>
<P>
As for player development, he said, not everyone is capable of becoming a 
Jamaal Wilkes. 
</P>
<P>
"But can they be the best they can be? It's not necessarily whether you win or 
lose, but can you walk away from that loss knowing that you gave it everything 
that you had? 
</P>
<P>
"That is what is important. That's growth." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai and Lyon, wearing coats and ties, stood in the wings at Biola's Chase 
Gymnasium recently, chatting before a game between their teams. A banner on a 
wall above their heads read: "Equipped to Do His Will." 
</P>
<P>
The chat was casual, not pressurized or phony as one might expect between two 
highly successful coaches at any level. 
</P>
<P>
When they departed for their respective benches, Lyon helped an assistant coach 
shuffle some chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Glancing into the bleachers, he noticed his young granddaughters. With a big 
grin, the veteran coach went into the stands to hug and kiss them. He spent 
several minutes there, his back to the court, while the Eagles continued a 
shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
His team, he said, was "in a hole" in its quest for the seventh (and final) 
playoff spot in District 3. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever happens to him, or the team, Lyon said, it would just be a small 
part of the eternity he expects to be waiting for him.

PALMISANO SCORES 36 IN THOUSAND OAKS LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After her standout freshman season of 1989, much was expected of Thousand Oaks 
High guard Michelle Palmisano. And while she has delivered, sometimes it still 
has not been enough. 
</P>
<P>
In a Marmonte League game at Thousand Oaks on Saturday night, Palmisano scored 
a game-high 36 points, but the Lancers nonetheless lost to Westlake, 63-58. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Melissa Gische had 25 points to lead a trio of double-figure scorers 
for Westlake (4-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks is 8-9, 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
In other girls' games: 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian 53, Miraleste 31 -- Forward Jana Kovar scored 14 points in 
the first half, three more than the Miraleste team, and host Village Christian 
(7-4, 4-0) rolled in the Alpha League game. 
</P>
<P>
Kovar finished with 22 points and 17 rebounds. Center LeeAnn Robinson had 18 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Brentwood 62, Campbell Hall 52 -- Despite 19 points and 21 rebounds by Kirsten 
Williams, Campbell Hall (6-6, 1-2) fell in a Delphic League game at home. 
Joanna Paul added 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall 43, Cedu 11 -- Highland Hall (6-5) climbed above .500 for the 
first time in seven years at Stonehurst Park in Sun Valley. Monica Palma scored 
a game-high 12 points and added 12 rebounds for the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist 52, Maranatha 46 -- Alex Pistone scored 12 points and had 14 
rebounds as L. A. Baptist, which trailed, 43-38, buried Maranatha with a 14-2 
run to open the fourth quarter in an Alpha League game at L. A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Shackelford added 15 points for L. A. Baptist (2-2 in league play).

ANTELOPE VALLEY RALLIES TO WIN IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Antelope Valley College overcame a seven-point deficit to force an overtime, 
then rallied past visiting Mt. San Jacinto, 115-107, Saturday night in a 
Foothill Conference men's basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Jacinto Coach John Chambers took his team off the court with three 
seconds left in overtime in protest of the officiating. Seconds earlier he had 
refused to put another player on the court after Ronald Simpson had fouled out. 
Mt. San Jacinto played with only four players. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches cleared with 24 seconds to play after Antelope Valley's Darren 
Thompson was fouled underneath the Mt. San Jacinto basket. Players from both 
sides had to be restrained after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The referees let everything go," Chambers said. "(Antelope Valley) committed 
some flagrant fouls. They'd better wear shoulder pads when they come to Mt. San 
Jacinto." 
</P>
<P>
Said Antelope Valley Coach Newton Chellete: "I'm not going to get into word 
contests with other coaches. I'm sorry the game had to end the way it did. Our 
kids deserved to win. We made our free throws, they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas sank two free throws with two seconds left in regulation to complete a 
furious comeback. Leading, 94-87, with 1:05 to play, Mt. San Jacinto (13-8, 2-2 
in conference play) hit only one of six free throws in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ernst hit a 20-foot jump shot with 44 seconds to play, Tony Madison made a 
reverse layup with 31 seconds left and Walter Brooks hit a layup 10 seconds 
later before Thomas was fouled driving to the basket with two seconds left. 
Madison and Brooks led Antelope Valley (17-6, 3-1) with 22 points and Ernst had 
20. KIRBY LEE

SOCKERS' MOMENTUM HALTED BY ST. LOUIS 
</P>

<P>
Cleveland giveth, St. Louis taketh away. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, just 24 hours after the Sockers turned in their most convincing home 
victory of the season against the Cleveland Crunch, the St. Louis Storm, an 
upstart expansion franchise, pulled out a pin, deflated the Sockers' confidence 
and burst their two-game winning streak. St. Louis 7, Sockers 4. 
</P>
<P>
This game played before 9,189 at the San Diego Sports Arena was on fast 
forward, both sides employing the counter attack. The Storm (10-11) took 
control briefly in the third quarter, taking advantage of a delay-of-game 
penalty assessed to Socker midfielder Brian Quinn when former Socker Fernando 
Clavijo scored 2:03 into the period. 
</P>
<P>
Socker forward Zoran Karic gave the Sockers a dash of hope a little more than a 
minute later, flashing some magical footwork in front of defender Emil 
Dragicevic, blowing past him to the left and drilling the ball past goalie 
Slobo Ilijevski. From then on, things came unglued. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis midfielder Claudio De Oliveira scored 5:21 into the fourth quarter 
and again at 10:42, after the Sockers had put in defender Kevin Crow as the 
sixth attacker. The victory pulled the Storm into a second-place tie with the 
Sockers (10-11), three games behind first-place Dallas in the Western Division 
of the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
A noticeably shaken team held a closed-door meeting after the game to iron out 
problems and plan for an upcoming four-game trip. Midfielder Brian Quinn and 
veteran Steve Zungul, who hasn't suited up for the past seven games, spoke at 
length about the team's difficulties. Socker Coach Ron Newman explained it to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say about that one?" he asked. "Our weakness defensively early in 
the game was evident. 
</P>
<P>
"(St. Louis) is a good side. They're better than when we played them last. 
They're certainly better than Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
The Crunch has been the one saving grace for the Sockers, who have defeated 
them with relative ease in all three meetings this season. But because they 
can't play them in all 52 games, the Sockers still have to be wondering when 
their inconsistencies will fall by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams got the most out of the first half, at least offensively. St. Louis 
led, 4-3, at halftime, after taking a 2-0 lead in the first quarter on goals by 
defender Mark Frederickson and forward Terry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:26 remaining in the quarter, the Sockers executed a nice fake on a 
restart kick, midfielder Branko Segota faking the shot and midfielder Waad 
Hirmez sending it in to the left corner with his left foot. But less than a 
minute later, forward Stan Terlecki gave the Storm another two-goal cushion, 
following a blocked shot by goalie Victor Nogueira and scoring with his right 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Crow made it 3-2 before the quarter ended, scoring his fifth goal of the season 
off an assist from Karic. 
</P>
<P>
Socker forward Jim Gabarra scored his first goal of the season in the second 
quarter to tie the score, 3-3. Once again the Storm retaliated quickly, forward 
Godfrey Ingram scoring on a long pass from De Oliveira to give St. Louis a 4-3 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
And that play was as indicative as any of the Sockers inability on this night 
to play consistent defense. Ingram was all by himself without a Socker defender 
in shouting distance. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a killing goal," Newman said. "From my point of view that was a 
terrible goal. Somebody missed an assignment. That was critical, just when the 
momentum was starting to swing our way." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was critical too, just when the momentum was starting to swing the 
Sockers way. This is all about the pride of a seven-time champion. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're paid to win, we're not paid to just play," Crow said. "I think a 
lot of people feel they're paid to just play. We're not like that. You can't 
accept mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
If things don't change, the Sockers may soon have to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Three Storm players are former Sockers: forward Gary Heale, and defenders Gus 
Mokalis and Fernando Clavijo. Mokalis was on the Sockers' championship team 
last season, Clavijo played from 1984-88 and Heale played on the Sockers' 
outdoor team in the North American Soccer League in 1983. . . . The Sockers and 
the Storm took turns tripping each other in the second quarter Saturday. First, 
midfielder Ben Collins planted his foot in the path of Clavijo, who took a nose 
dive and had to be helped off the carpet. Minutes later, Storm forward Stan 
Terlecki came off the bench early on a substitution and, in the process, 
tripped defender George Fernandez, who dropped in the same manner as Clavijo. 
Both returned later in the quarter. . . . Midfielder Branko Segota moved into 
first place on the Sockers' all-time assist scoring list with 214 when he 
assisted on forward Damir Haramina's goal in Friday's 4-1 victory over 
Cleveland.

GROSSMONT 2-A BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN WITHOUT CLARK, VALHALLA THE FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HAZELTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valhalla went 6-0 to win the Grossmont 2-A League basketball title last year, 
and the only thing that should be different this season is that the Norsemen 
will probably go 8-0 to win it because of the addition of West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Tony Clark's transfer to Christian, Valhalla was the favorite. Only 
Grossmont was given much of a chance to challenge the Norsemen, with eight of 
nine players returning. 
</P>
<P>
But that chance seemed to have disappeared when center Todd Cady, the team's 
leading scorer and rebounder, quit to concentrate on baseball, and Keith Price, 
a second-team All-County running back, decided not to play after he injured a 
knee early. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothillers showed earlier they still might give Valhalla some problems by 
upsetting Mt. Miguel, 59-56, at Mt. Miguel. Grossmont's biggest hope is that 
its pressure defense will bother the Norsemen enough to take them out of their 
game plan. That is what Mt. Miguel did in an easy victory over Valhalla two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The league's other three teams -- Santana, El Cajon Valley and Santana -- have 
a combined record of 3-37 thus far. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contender: Valhalla (17-8 in 1988-89). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Grossmont (6-17) 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: El Cajon Valley (3-19), Santana (14-9), West Hills 
(first year). 
</P>
<P>
Games of the year: Grossmont at Valhalla (Tuesday) and Valhalla at Grossmont 
(Feb. 2). This is about as close to a big game as it will get this season. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The man: Well, it's a Tony, but not the one everyone expected. Valhalla point 
guard Tony Lee has established himself as the player this season. Tony Clark 
was supposed to be the most dominant player in the conference since Bill Walton 
played at Helix, but Clark took his game to nearby Christian, and the Norsemen 
are feeling it. With both Tonys, Valhalla figured to be one of the county's top 
teams, but Coach Manny Silva still has something to work with in Lee. He leads 
the league in scoring with 22.3 points a game, and his two free throws in the 
final seconds helped Valhalla upset Monte Vista in Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Tony Clark's shoes? Any chance Bill Walton has another year of 
eligibility? Just a thought. Clark averaged 31 points last season and is 
averaging 43 for Christian this year. Nobody comes close in the county, let 
alone the Grossmont 2-A League. Lee has taken on the bulk of Clark's offense 
for Valhalla. But when he's not hitting from the outside, the Norsemen 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: With Cady and Price missing, Grossmont has relied on Kevin 
Simon and Todd Jaeger; Simon is averaging 16.1 points, Jaeger 12.6. Talent in 
the rest of the league is thin. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Parting shot: Some thought that when Tony Clark left Division I Valhalla to 
play at Division V Christian, he would be playing against inferior competition. 
Maybe in the playoffs, but not in league. The Grossmont 2-A League has only one 
team over .500 (Valhalla at 11-8), and the other four are a combined 10-44. 
Christian has joined the newly formed Harbor League, which has four of five 
members over .500. 
</P>
<P>
A tough hill to climb: West Hills is playing its first year of varsity 
basketball, and the season is getting to be a long one. The Wolfpack has yet to 
win a game (0-11) and might be hard pressed to get a league victory. Their best 
chance appears to be at home against El Cajon Valley Tuesday.

PERESTROIKA PROSPERS AT PEPPERDINE; 
</P>
<P>
JOINT SOVIET-U.S. PROJECTS BELY CAMPUS'S CONSERVATIVE IMAGE

Pepperdine University is becoming a hotbed of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, 
something that the founder of Western Auto Supply Co. may not have expected 
when he established the Christian school in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
With the arrival last week of a card-carrying member of the Soviet Communist 
Party for four months of study at the seaside campus, the hills of Malibu are 
even more alive with the sound of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Tyurenkov, 26, who arrived with his wife and 1-year-old son, will be 
taking classes at Pepperdine and working with senior Scott Talcott to produce a 
Soviet-American student journal called Montage. 
</P>
<P>
He will join a circle of Pepperdine students and faculty who have devoted 
themselves to U.S.-Soviet affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Political science professor Dan Caldwell is the newly named head of the Forum 
for U.S.-Dialogue, a volunteer group that arranges yearly meetings between 
professionals from both countries. 
</P>
<P>
Writing teacher Anthony Manousos' collection of short stories and poems is a 
hit in the Soviet Union, where the book, which he edited with a Soviet 
colleague, sold 50,000 copies in one month. 
</P>
<P>
And Chancellor Emeritus M. Norvel Young hopes to take part in a Soviet-American 
writers conference to be held in the Soviet Union later this year. 
</P>
<P>
All this may seem surprising at a campus where attendance is taken at prayers 
once a week and where students in a psychology class, asked to list deviant 
traits such as thievery and drug abuse, jokingly included the word Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly Christian, and it's also correct to say that compared to most 
other institutions in Southern California, we're fairly conservative," said 
John G. Watson, vice president for student affairs at the Malibu school. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that we want to be blind to having open dialogue about all 
issues," he said. "That's what higher education is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Founded just over 50 years ago by George Pepperdine, an auto parts tycoon who 
wanted to train Christian business leaders, the school is linked with the 
Churches of Christ, a denomination that believes in a literal acceptance of the 
Bible. It is independently funded, largely by contributions from prominent 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Rehnquist, now chief justice of the United States, taught law there, 
and Arthur Laffer, whose famous curve became a symbol of Reaganomics, has also 
been on the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
But as early as 1985, when memories of President Reagan's rhetoric about "the 
evil empire" were still fresh, the university was host to a group of Soviet 
writers and to delegates from Caldwell's Forum for U.S.-Soviet Dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
These developments were no surprise to Young, who knew George Pepperdine for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt the truth had nothing to fear from comparison, whether moral, ethical, 
economic or political," said Young, who stepped down as president and 
chancellor five years ago but continues to be active at the university. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, shall we say, loyal here to our traditional values, but also very 
global in our outlook," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For a college of its size, 2,300 undergraduates, "There's quite a bit going 
on," said Caldwell, who has been on the faculty since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it partially is coincidental, different activities revolving around 
different individuals who have taken the initiative; and the other thing is 
that the administration has been very supportive of those efforts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He compared the school's links with the Soviet Union to his own activities with 
the Forum, which stages conferences in the United States and the Soviet Union 
in alternate years. 
</P>
<P>
"Though there is a theoretical case for conservatives saying, 'you shouldn't 
deal with the Soviets,' I've only had positive feedback from the conservative 
folks involved in (the Forum), and the same applies to the campus," Caldwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students may seem more interested in surfing, dating or business 
careers than in international relations. But when a Soviet debate team appeared 
at the campus on the night of the final game of the 1988 World Series, students 
"half-filled the auditorium at the law school," said Manousos, whose book, "The 
Human Experience," has sold about 6,000 copies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I knew the interest was pretty keen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a 50-day vigil organized by Talcott and several other students in 1988 
demanded direct links between Pepperdine and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
They addressed their appeal for a sister campus and a U.S.-Soviet student 
newsletter to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who never actually responded 
-- distracted, perhaps, by the December, 1988, earthquake that devastated 
Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
But through his telephone contacts with Soviet students, Talcott came upon 
Tyurenkov, then a student at the Baumann State Technical University in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Learning that Tyurenkov and two other Soviet students were about to come to the 
United States to visit Cincinnati University, Talcott, a political science 
major, persuaded the student government at Pepperdine to put up $2,000 for them 
to visit the Malibu campus for three days last March. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the back seat of a convertible bound for Disneyland that the idea was 
hatched for Montage, which will appear in English and Russian four times a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The editors are looking at stories and artwork from students in both countries. 
After a final conference in March, the first edition will be printed in the 
United States, and in May, 40,000 copies will be distributed in each country. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine contributed $7,000 worth of computer hardware for the Soviet side of 
the project that Talcott and co-publisher Susan McKean, a Slavic languages 
major at Stanford University, took to Moscow in December. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very bold and commendable of Pepperdine that they're exploring 
this," McKean, of Bernardston, Mass., said in a telephone interview from Palo 
Alto. "They're trying to get away from the reputation that most people know 
about Pepperdine." 
</P>
<P>
The university also advanced the students a $9,000 grubstake to help publish 
the premiere issue, and granted Tyurenkov a $6,000 scholarship to cover the 
tuition of his courses in the great books, international relations and American 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Like Talcott -- who was so busy during his two trips to the Soviet Union that 
he has not yet seen the Kremlin -- Tyurenkov has been in a whirl since arriving 
in the United States three days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
After visiting Talcott's family at their home in Tacoma, Wash., and at their 
cabin in Montana, Tyurenkov and his family moved into a borrowed apartment in 
Malibu Village this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone up north warned us about Southern California," he said. "It was like 
the image of America we had for some years in the Soviet Union -- dangerous, a 
very dangerous place to live." 
</P>
<P>
Tyurenkov, a Communist Party member for five years, was introduced to a 
different view of America at a meeting of the Malibu Rotary Club on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really unusual because they were such serious people, but they like to 
relax in a funny way," he said of the Rotarians, who like to sing and tell 
jokes at their weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is too early to make any judgments about the Malibu campus, except 
that "the students are the same as in our country. I don't mean in faith, but 
in habits and behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The only other Christian college he knows is the Russian Orthodox seminary at 
Zagorsk, a town outside Moscow that goes back to medieval times, where acolytes 
in beards and robes prepare for lives of religious ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's very interesting to be here and to understand the differences between 
our Christian college and here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fer sure, dude.

COASTAL PANEL DEADLOCKS OVER CHOOSING CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE SELECTION OF A NEW CHAIRMAN IS SEEN AS PIVOTAL IN CONTROLLING THE 
COMMISSION. MEMBERS SPLIT 6-6 BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALIST CANDIDATE AND ONE CALLED 
PRO-DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>

<P>
The California Coastal Commission has deadlocked on the choice of a new 
chairman, with environmentalists and pro-development members at odds over who 
should head the panel. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last Wednesday in Marina del Rey, the commission split 6 to 6 
between Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, backed by environmentalists, 
and David Malcolm, a Chula Vista city councilman aligned with pro-development 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Jack Liebster said Thursday that the matter will be 
reconsidered at the group's meeting next month in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
David Hart, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said the leadership fight highlights the 
struggle for control over direction of the 12-member commission, established to 
protect the state's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the outcome of the race will be a clear indication of whether the 
commission will be more oriented toward developers or will "continue . . . its 
relatively good record of fairly applying the Coastal Act." 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Act of 1976 allowed local governments to regulate coastal 
development by adopting new land-use plans and zoning ordinances. The 
commission is responsible for approving the local plans. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she became a candidate only after Robert Franco of Del Rey Oaks, a 
pro-environmental commissioner, was unable to win a majority of votes for the 
chairmanship. "He didn't know if he could get the seventh vote and that's where 
my name came in as an alternative," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to contrast herself and Malcolm, Howard said: "I am more of an 
environmentalist and I guess that's really where the difference comes in. 
Malcolm is probably more developmentally oriented than I am." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm, a real estate developer, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the administration of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a liberal Democrat 
with strong environmental leanings, the commission was dominated by 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
With the election of Gov. George Deukmejian in 1982, the balance of power 
shifted. Deukmejian, who has called for the abolition of the commission, 
appointed four new members who generally shared his view that land-use planning 
is best left to local officials. In addition, Deukmejian reduced the agency's 
budget and staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's Democratic leaders helped win appointment for several 
commissioners in the early 1980s who appeared to be more sympathetic to 
developers than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Howard was appointed to the commission in 1987 by the Democratic-controlled 
Senate Rules Committee after a lengthy search for an environmentalist who could 
win Senate confirmation. The Rules Committee, Deukmejian and Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) can each appoint four commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move last month, Howard told fellow commissioners that she was 
resigning, citing personal problems involving the death of her husband and her 
desire not to take on additional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's husband of 34 years died last March from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound. At the time, Howard was recovering from a fractured pelvis she suffered 
in a fall at her home. 
</P>
<P>
But she changed her mind about leaving the commission, Howard said, after 
learning that "it would take several months to have someone appointed to my 
seat. I felt that was unfair to the commission, so I'm staying. . . . I am more 
committed than ever to the commission." 
</P>
<P>
If she had resigned, Howard said, it would have "left a commission that was 
very pro-development. And I don't feel that was fair or right." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she plans to stay on the commission until her Burbank council term 
ends in 16 months. She has decided not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's on-again, off-again resignation comes as Brown and the Rules Committee 
must replace two commissioners who are leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee must replace environmentalist Michael Wornum, a former 
assemblyman who is mayor of Larkspur. Wornum is the outgoing chairman of the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is interviewing candidates to fill the slot of Charles Warren, a former 
Los Angeles assemblyman who also is in the environmental camp. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Thursday, Brown said he is seeking to appoint 
"somebody who will keep me out of trouble" and "who is absolutely devoid" of 
any conflicts of interest.

Sacramento and Carlos Lozano in Burbank.

CITIES STRUGGLE TO FUND REPAIRS IN A STREET FIGHT OF ANOTHER KIND; 
</P>
<P>
INFRASTRUCTURE: CRACKING ASPHALT. GAPING POTHOLES. THE ONLY ASPECT OF STREET 
REPAIRS THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GROWING IS THE BUDGET TO PAY FOR THEM. 
</P>

Jorge Verdugo says his Pomona street is in sorry shape. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he peers from his window and sees drivers, shaken after a bumpy ride 
along Wilart Place, get out of their cars to check for blowouts. For fun, 
neighborhood children have been known to pry loose fragments of asphalt from 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
"The street looks like a puzzle; it's so broken up," complained Verdugo, a 
49-year-old engineer who has gotten so fed up that he took his grievance to 
City Hall five times last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilart Place is a small part of Pomona's estimated $20-million street 
maintenance backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the city is considering issuing bonds of $7 million or more to 
repair its aging streets, "you're never done," said Glen Lewis, the city's 
acting public works director. "You just keep working, and the list keeps 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
And Pomona is not alone in its street maintenance woes. Across the San Gabriel 
Valley, from Pasadena to Claremont, cities are falling ever further behind. And 
potholes and "alligator" cracks increasingly are becoming a fact of life on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey published by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission in 1987, cities countywide have less than half the money they need 
to properly repair their streets. The study, "On the Road to the Year 2000," 
took a city-by-city look at street repair funds. It predicted that, at this 
rate of gradual deterioration, nearly 60% of local streets will be falling 
apart within 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County alone has put off more than $200 million in street repairs 
in unincorporated areas because of inadequate funds, said Ron Ornee, spokesman 
for the county Department of Public Works. "The situation is bad, and it's 
getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
So cities have begun to respond to the impending crisis with new urgency, with 
measures ranging from blue ribbon panels to multimillion-dollar bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
In an ambitious attempt to catch up, Pasadena is considering issuing $10 
million to $20 million in bonds this year toward infrastructure needs, 
including roads. Officials said about $3.5 million of the money would be 
earmarked for street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the city issued $23.1 million in similar bonds, of which $9.1 million 
went toward completing postponed street work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," City Engineer Dave Barnhart said of the 
undertaking. Without additional bond funds, Barnhart said, his annual regular 
street maintenance budget of $1.9 million will fall short by $2 million to $4 
million each year for the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
In Covina, meanwhile, voters will decide April 10 whether to create a special 
fire assessment district that would generate an annual $1.6 million, which in 
turn would free city money to help alleviate the city's $20-million maintenance 
backlog for streets, storm drains and street lights. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north in Azusa, city bureaucrats recently made aggressive efforts to 
persuade council members to finance urgently needed maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, the need has been neglected because of the lack of understanding," said 
Robert DeLoach, public works director. "There has been no special interest 
group waving the maintenance flag." 
</P>
<P>
But after watching city-produced videotapes of dilapidated sewer lines and 
seeing photographs of pothole-studded streets, the city council approved a 
citywide fire assessment district, which is expected to free about $960,000 a 
year in general fund money for street maintenance, DeLoach said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the expected boost, though, DeLoach said it would take years to clear 
his street maintenance backlog, currently at $4.5 million. "If I had $1 million 
a year, it would take me six to seven years to catch up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In West Covina, a blue ribbon committee in 1988 identified $54.4 million in 
infrastructure maintenance needs, including road repairs, that will not be met 
over the next 15 years if the city's current funding pattern continues. The 
City Council has yet to act on the committee's recommendations to create a 
special assessment district or to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected proposals by Councilmen Bill Tarozzi and Brad McFadden to 
make cuts elsewhere in the budget to raise $3 million toward maintenance. City 
officials instead have placed the matter on the back burner until June. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, they hope California voters will approve a 9-cent hike in the 
state gas tax, which would be used in part to bolster street maintenance funds 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, West Covina's street maintenance backlog has 
increased by $700,000, rising to $10 million, said Public Works Director Harry 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Streets are usually the biggest problem (in a city's infrastructure) just 
because of the amount of investment in that facility and their relatively short 
life," he said. Sewers, for instance, can last more than 100 years, whereas 
streets have a life span of about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas warned that road safety will become a problem within the next five to 10 
years unless funding is increased. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra officials say they've learned that catching such problems early can 
save money in the long run. The city's annual street maintenance costs have 
dropped from between $400,000 and $450,000 in the early '80s to $260,000 now, 
said Public Works Director Terry James. Alhambra created a public works 
maintenance and improvement district, and the city sold bonds of $10 million 
toward pavement, sidewalk and street lighting repairs in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saving ourselves maintenance costs down the road by doing repairs 
quickly," James said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Alhambra reports a $3.6-million maintenance shortfall this year 
because of an expensive repaving and reconstruction project on Mission Road 
that the city cannot afford to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Gabriel Valley officials blame part of the road maintenance crisis on 
Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 tax-cutting initiative that restrained 
cities' ability to raise money. It was only last year that state legislators 
approved an amendment allowing cities to create assessment districts to 
generate funds for street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Others note that, amid a slew of interest groups clamoring for funds for other 
services, there are few organized lobbyists to plead the lowly pothole's case. 
To combat that, Pasadena has hired a full-time employee to make sure that 
public works projects receive their fair share of the funding pie. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make a special effort to protect infrastructure funds, they will 
be eaten up by operational demands," said Pasadena City Manager Don McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
Still others point the finger at California's gas tax, the lowest in the 
nation, for failing to generate more street repair revenues. The situation has 
worsened as gas-efficient cars have become more commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"With more fuel-efficient cars on the market, (gas tax) revenue has flattened 
out, even though the number of miles traveled is increasing," said Ornee of the 
county's public works department. 
</P>
<P>
So Pasadena public works officials, like their counterparts throughout the 
valley, are pinning their hopes on the statewide ballot measure for a 9-cent 
gas tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
If it passes, Pasadena would net an average of $800,000 annually in the first 
10 years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But if it fails, McIntyre said, "we won't be able to keep up, which will be 
unfortunate because we've spent so much to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
ROAD BUDGET SHORTFALLS 
</P>
<P>
Local cities say their road maintenance budgets are falling short by millions 
of dollars. The following estimates, supplied by city public works directors 
and engineers, provide a city-by-city look at the funding shortfall during 
fiscal year 1989-90.

ROTHENBERG NEARS RELEASE, HIS FUTURE HOME A SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is working on a yard crew in San Luis Obispo, picking up trash, maybe doing 
a bit of prison landscaping. But after 6 3/4 years behind bars, the man who 
shocked the country by burning his 6-year-old son nearly to death will be free 
in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
And not even Charles Rothenberg knows where he is going. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage over release of the man who permanently disfigured his son in a 
1983 Buena Park motel fire has forced officials to keep the location of his 
future home a secret. 
</P>
<P>
A desert hamlet in November overwhelmingly opposed his parole there, and at 
least one state senator has received angry letters from constituents protesting 
his freedom. A Whittier family who said two years ago they would help 
Rothenberg upon his release now set for Jan. 24 claim they received death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials now fear a repeat of the 1987 Lawrence Singleton debacle -- in 
which the parolee was virtually driven by furious citizens from Northern 
California communities because he raped a teen-age girl and axed off her 
forearms. 
</P>
<P>
So even authorities where Rothenberg is headed will be in the dark until "a day 
or two" before he arrives from the California Men's Colony. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact of life that we have to tell a few public officials," said Tipton 
C. Kindel, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, which oversees 
California's prisons. "But obviously, based on the Singleton experience, we're 
trying to get (Rothenberg) placed without having an entourage of media 
following him." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly where Rothenberg will be housed and employed remains undecided, 
although it might be outside California, corrections officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, parolees are located near family or friends who can support the 
felon's return to civilian life. But Rothenberg's only surviving relatives -- 
Los Angeles residents -- severed ties with him years ago and said recently they 
want no further contact. Two women have visited and want to marry Rothenberg, 
an acquaintance claims, but prison officials said romantic involvements have no 
bearing on parole decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few people who will be told of the arsonist's whereabouts is his son, 
David Rothenberg, now 13, and David's mother and stepfather, Marie and Richard 
Hafdahl, who live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the jealous father who horribly burned his son trying to hurt the 
wife who divorced him was the subject of a 1989 television movie, and mounting 
media coverage of his pending release threaten to make Rothenberg's a familiar 
face. His most recent televised interview has been broadcast throughout the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
So if his return to society is anonymous, Kindel said, it "stands a better 
chance of working." 
</P>
<P>
As his release approaches, Rothenberg and prison officials agree it is 
regrettable. 
</P>
<P>
"The crime was absolutely disgusting to the rest of society and (corrections 
officials) are not entirely comfortable with him walking free," Kindel said. 
"But every effort to keep him in prison was exhausted. We have no choice. Even 
if he wanted to stay behind bars he couldn't, unless he violated prison rules. 
Even then, we couldn't keep him much longer." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter last month to the Times, Rothenberg added: "Do I deserve to be set 
free? No! It's an unforgiveable act." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 49, has spent much of his life behind bars. He had a criminal 
record before he was 18, although his most serious crime was an attempted armed 
robbery, for which he was jailed. He was in prison part of the three years he 
and David's mother were married, and they were divorced in 1978 while he was 
serving time for check forgery. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Rothenberg -- now Marie Hafdahl -- never took David to the prison for 
visits with his father, thinking the boy could be told when he was old enough 
to understand. Investigators believe that the two-year separation from his son 
may have been what prompted him to take David with him when he fled New York -- 
and an arrest warrant charging him with vandalizing the tony Manhattan 
restaurant where he'd worked as a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
His adoration for David bordered on the obsessive, but Marie never doubted 
Rothenberg's love for his son. He doted on David like a mother lion with her 
cub. He dutifully paid child support, showered his son with gifts and walked 
him home from grade school most days. 
</P>
<P>
So when he told his ex-wife he wanted to take David on a weeklong vacation to 
the Catskills, she agreed. Instead, Rothenberg took his son to Orange County, 
where they checked into a Buena Park motel and planned to visit Disneyland and 
Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
It rained most of that week, and David was restless, crying about missing his 
mother. In an ill-fated phone call to Marie, Rothenberg accidentally hinted of 
their whereabouts in asking for more time with his boy. Marie angrily opposed 
the idea and told her ex-husband he would never see his son again once they 
returned to New York. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, holding his son's hand, Rothenberg walked to a hardware store, 
where he bought a jug of kerosene. The next day father and son checked into the 
Beach Boulevard Travelodge. 
</P>
<P>
In the minutes after midnight that March 3, Rothenberg poured kerosene around 
David's bed, kissed his soon goodby and then struck a match at the door. He 
closed the door and drove across the street, where he watched from a phone 
booth as flames blew furiously out of the motel. 
</P>
<P>
As he fled to Northern California, his repeated phone calls about his boy's 
condition to hospitals and police cast immediate suspicion on him. When he was 
arrested in San Francisco a week after the fire, he confessed he had tried to 
kill his son because "If I can't have him, nobody else can." 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other charges related to the 
fire, all of which earned him a 13-year prison sentence. It was the maximum 
permitted by determinant-sentencing laws, which have since been toughened as a 
result of attempted murders whose victims survive but are forever disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
The work-incentive law allows prisoners a day off their sentence for every day 
they work or participate in an education program. Rothenberg has largely been a 
model prisoner although he will have served a total of six years and 10 months 
behind bars; a few extra weeks were added to his sentence for violating prison 
rules by having letters personally delivered to David's stepfather instead of 
mailing them. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of being paroled last December, he'll walk free next week. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever Rothenberg goes, officials stress, his actions will be "intensely 
scrutinized" until his parole ends in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be out of prison," said Kindel of the Corrections Department, "but 
he's not going to be free." 
</P>
<P>
Numerous conditions on Rothenberg's parole include reporting regularly to his 
parole officer, weekly outpatient visits for psychiatric counseling and dogged 
supervision, Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
Mother and son have been promised that Rothenberg will not be paroled to Orange 
County, where they now live with Hafdahl, the Buena Park police officer who 
supervised the 1983 fire investigation. Rothenberg will be forbidden to make 
any contact with them and leave the "jurisdiction" to which he will be paroled. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, has been little comfort for the son Rothenberg left scarred from 
third-degree burns over 90% of his body. Now halfway through eighth grade, 
David is still troubled by nightmares about his father harming him again. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to know when this will all be over," Dick Hafdahl said of his 
stepson. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg insists that he will not "bother" his son, for whom he professes 
undying love. At the same time, Rothenberg clings to the hope of one day seeing 
him again. 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to be interviewed for this story for fear of jeopardizing 
his parole and a book deal, Rothenberg responded to questions by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Publication of "A World Without Tears," a book in which Rothenberg offers his 
version of the events leading to the now notorious fire, has been delayed. 
Aimed at helping parents avoid child abuse through awareness, the book dissects 
the tragedy and features analysis of Rothenberg by a New Jersey psychologist, a 
minister and Harry Gaynor, director of the National Burn Victim Foundation. 
Gaynor said the company that was to publish the book disbanded but insists it 
will be in print soon. 
</P>
<P>
Its proceeds will benefit the nonprofit foundation, but Rothenberg never would 
have made money off the book anyway because state law bans criminals from 
profiting from their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
The book, Rothenberg wrote, will assure "that there will never be another David 
Rothenberg incident, or a father or mother who would cause such pain and 
suffering to their child, as I have done to my own son." 
</P>
<P>
The publishers had "arranged a few carefully selected major (television) 
appearances after I depart" prison, Rothenberg wrote in one of several letters 
to The Times. "However, I will not flaunt myself around or sign books. This is 
a project I agreed to do for other parents. The book, hopefully, will touch 
millions." 
</P>
<P>
In another letter, he added: "Read it and let it sink in. You as well as 
millions around the country will be stunned." 
</P>
<P>
And in another: "The response has been overwhelming. You have no idea how many 
media people want to see me. . . . Probation, parole, and schools who heard I 
wanted to help parents (are) wanting this book. It's been too much." 
</P>
<P>
"As you know," he added, "my only purpose was to attempt to 'reach my son' all 
these years." 
</P>
<P>
He seems lately to have found religion, sending greeting cards to reporters 
with quotes such as, "Blessed are they who see Christmas through the eyes of a 
child. Let this be your gift at Christmas, and your families!!" 
</P>
<P>
He talks of overwhelming guilt, and of accepting responsibility for nearly 
killing his son. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you or even find the words to explain the pain that is in my 
heart. . . . I do not ask forgiveness; I cannot forgive myself. Only through 
Jesus Christ who died for my sins can I live in this world -- and I will." 
</P>
<P>
He has said he received one-on-one psychiatric counseling at his own request 
and maintains he is "mentally stable." 
</P>
<P>
In repeated attempts by prison and law enforcement officials to extend 
Rothenberg's time behind bars, his mental health has been evaluated by the 
state, Kindel said. Two of three psychiatrists who have examined him since 1983 
found him to be free of mental disorders, Kindel said. A third found him to be 
"a mentally disordered violent offender" last January and under state law 
Rothenberg could have been held indefinitely for psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But the day after his examination, the state Supreme Court found the law 
unconstitutional on the ground that it effectively extended an inmate's 
sentence after the fact. And a replacement law passed later last year could not 
be applied to Rothenberg's case. 
</P>
<P>
Although prison authorities have been circumspect about Rothenberg's parole 
destination, they also concede that the inmate's enjoyment of media attention 
may ultimately lead him to reveal his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent letter to The Times, Rothenberg promised to "surface" once 
he is settled in his new home. "P.S.," he added, "see Dec. 4th issue of 
Newsweek, page 6." 
</P>
<P>
Kindel said this history of frequent correspondence with reporters is precisely 
why Rothenberg "will be among the last to know" his parole destination. "Then 
there is less likelihood of him telling somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, Kindel added, has only lately been realizing the ferocity of public 
sentiment toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor, whose foundation stands to gain publicity and potentially thousands of 
dollars if the book sells, acknowledges his own conflicts about Rothenberg's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we stone him? Do we tie him to a tree and burn him? What do we do?" Gaynor 
wondered aloud on Friday. "As the book says, my pastor's first reaction was to 
shoot him. But he is a human being; he's a person. So we watch him like a hawk 
and let him prove himself, his sincerity to do the right thing."

ORANGE COUNTY MONORAIL PLAN IS TALK OF THE TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, they're all trying to hop aboard this train. 
</P>
<P>
In traffic-choked Orange County, a proposal to build an 18-mile monorail line 
through the heart of the region has normally staid politicos and bureaucrats 
abuzz with anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Fullerton and Huntington Beach have been clamoring in recent 
weeks to join five central Orange County cities that have already started a 
push for the futuristic transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal received another big boost last week when a Japanese development 
conglomerate announced that it wants to build a monorail station as part of a 
massive high-rise complex it plans for northern Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real significant milestone in putting together this project and making 
it a reality," said Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who is helping spearhead 
the effort for a regional monorail network. "We're hoping that developers see 
the value of having a monorail station as part of their project." 
</P>
<P>
The network would link Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium in the north with the 
MainPlace shopping mall and Civic Center in Santa Ana, then continue south, 
serving several large office developments, John Wayne Airport, and the 
sprawling Irvine Spectrum office and industrial complex. The line could be 
extended to Fullerton, Huntington Beach or other cities that express a strong 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Other lines would branch off east and west to feed riders to the main system. 
For instance, the short spur planned at the airport would be expanded into a 
loop meandering through the Irvine business park, while another would link the 
Santa Ana Civic Center with the city's Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials seem to be leaning toward traditional monorails akin to the type 
at Disneyland, which straddle a single rail and ride on wheels inside the 
undercarriage. Others have suggested that the best system might involve 
"magnetic levitation" trains, which use electromagnets to float the vehicle 
just inches above the tracks and provide propulsion. And some experts say 
traditional steel-wheel trolleys should not be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the system would be a line with monorail trains capable of 
traveling about 60 m.p.h. and running along an elevated rail stretching from 
Irvine in the south through various cities to as far north as Fullerton. 
Lower-speed monorail lines would branch off the main system to ferry passengers 
to locations to the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the monorail network -- which they view as a clean, efficient 
method of easing highway congestion -- could be built along existing streets, 
requiring the purchase of little or no private property. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the optimism, problems may loom. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been little or no public discussion of the plans. No hearings 
have been held, no workshops convened. Though the idea certainly appeals to 
city leaders eager for a way out of traffic congestion, only time will tell how 
well it plays with residents or businesses in the shadow of a monorail line. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, however, local officials will have to deal with a bevy of 
questions, most notably how such a grand undertaking, which could cost nearly 
$1 billion, would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
Young and many other supporters hope that a private firm can be lured to build 
and operate the monorail, while the cities along the route ante up the median 
strips on their streets as the right of way for the elevated rail system. With 
developers building the stations, the line could be realized at virtually no 
cost to taxpayers other than what they throw into the fare box, they predict. 
</P>
<P>
But some officials suggest that it is unlikely such a rosy scenario will become 
reality. Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, a staunch advocate of a regional monorail 
system, maintains that the project will probably require a hefty dose of public 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be wonderful if private investment could build this," Agran 
said. "We're going to certainly induce as much private investment as possible. 
But to suggest somehow that this will be handled almost entirely by the private 
sector may be misleading. I'd like to be proven wrong, but I think there will 
have to be substantial public investment." 
</P>
<P>
There is precedent for such thinking. No public rail system has ever been 
financed, built and operated strictly by the private sector, transit officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been done at airports and amusement parks, but not with a public transit 
system, certainly not in North America," said Brian Pearson, development 
director at the Orange County Transit District. "That is not to say it couldn't 
happen if it was tied in with certain development efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Other local officials, meanwhile, have privately speculated that Young has 
eagerly pounced on the issue because of its appeal with voters. Much as 
construction of the San Diego trolley helped boost the political stock of Sen. 
Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) when he was mayor of that city, a successful monorail 
could fuel the career of the politician who shepherds it in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the effort to lure private investment say such motivations 
may not be such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Young is extremely politically astute, and he's grabbed a tiger by the 
tail and gone for a ride," said Harvey Englander, a Newport Beach political 
consultant. "Now he finds a lot of people wanting to join him for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"The naysayers ought to jump out of the way. If they want, they can stand on 
the sidelines and say a private approach isn't going to work. They'll be in the 
same position as the people with horses who watched the Model A's roll by." 
</P>
<P>
Young, meanwhile, remains optimistic, noting that he has received inquiries 
from about 20 transportation firms intrigued by the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy has been, 'You don't know until you ask,' " Young said. "The 
goal is for the private sector to respond to our offer, to take the ball and 
run with it. We want them to design, construct and operate this system. That's 
the goal. And we won't know until we get responses whether it's realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Even officials in Irvine acknowledge that the effort to seek a privately built 
system is worth a try. As now envisioned, the coalition of cities would ask for 
proposals from private firms as early as April. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the private sector is going to see the wisdom of this project and get 
on the bandwagon," said Paul Brady Jr., Irvine city manager. "The public sector 
cannot do it by itself." 
</P>
<P>
If public money does end up coming into the picture, Irvine is the only city 
that has a good prospect of accumulating a sizable bankroll any time soon. City 
officials managed to get funding for a monorail line included in a state rail 
bond measure on the June ballot. If the proposition passes, $125 million in 
matching funds would flow into Irvine's city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the other cities have going for them, but I seriously doubt 
they have readily available resources that are only six months away," Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With that money in hand, Irvine would probably be the first city to put the 
line in place and, as such, be in a position to dictate what type of technology 
is used. Agran's hope is that an Irvine system could demonstrate the 
effectiveness of a monorail in Orange County, spurring state and federal 
officials to provide more funds so the line could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
But it could also create a problem. Other cities could be put in a position of 
either following Irvine's lead or creating a patchwork regional transportation 
system combining varying types of rail systems that might not even be capable 
of operating on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
Monorail boosters like Young say all the gloomy predictions are ridiculous, 
arguing that the effort to build a monorail line can be coordinated so the 
various cities are happy with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to have a regional system that is compatible," said Young, who 
helped fuel the effort by calling officials from the cities together for a 
meeting last November. "I'm trying to head off any problems by pulling us all 
together now. We want to make sure this system is compatible from one city to 
the next." 
</P>
<P>
All this talk of monorails was sparked by a 1988 proposal to build a short 
monorail line to ferry passengers from the terminal at John Wayne Airport to an 
office complex planned nearby on MacArthur Boulevard by McDonnell Douglas 
Realty Co. Construction has been delayed because Irvine officials have yet to 
approve plans for the office complex, which is expected to get a final review 
in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
When Irvine managed to squeeze a spot on the June rail bond measure, the 
prospects for a regional system grew. At last November's meeting, county 
officials and representatives of Santa Ana, Irvine, Orange, Costa Mesa and 
Anaheim agreed to work toward issuing a joint request for proposals from 
private firms that might be willing to build and operate the system. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. MONORAIL: A PROPOSAL FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the monorail system proposed in Orange County would be trains 
capable of about 60 m.p.h. running along a raised rail stretching from Irvine 
in the south through various cities to as far north as Fullerton. Lower-speed 
monorail lines would branch off the main system to ferry passengers to 
locations to the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned, the monorail network would link Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium 
in the north with the MainPlace/Santa Ana mall and the Civic Center in Santa 
Ana, several large office developments, John Wayne Airport and the sprawling 
Irvine Spectrum office and industrial complex. It would also link up in Anaheim 
with a high-speed "super train" planned to run from the city's train station to 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The line could also be extended to Fullerton, Huntington Beach or other cities 
that express a strong interest.

STALWART RAM FANS HAVE A BALL IN SAN FRANCISCO

<P>
At the posh reception in the Golden Gate Way ballroom at the Hyatt Regency 
Saturday night, even the food symbolized the fan loyalties for the game between 
the Rams and 49ers, who face off under cloudy skies today for the NFC 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams people dug into pizza from a station at "Hollywood and Vine," 
surrounded by movie posters and stuffed pink flamingos. The 49ers piled their 
plates from a boatload of seafood a la Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Rams owner Georgia Frontiere swept into the party fashionably late, 
sparkling in an amethyst necklace and bead-splashed turquoise chiffon dress. 
"I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it," she said. "It's going to be the Rams 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Rams fans can get invited to parties at the Hyatt. But the hundreds of 
Rams supporters who made it to San Francisco for the game to decide the NFC's 
Super Bowl team found the city teeming with football fever, undampened by the 
rainy weather. None of the Rams' fans lacked for spirit either. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco International Airport, Yvonne De Jon of Long Beach was decked 
in Ram colors -- a blue and gold Bermuda-style hat, with a football-helmet 
charm dangling from her neck, and a Rams' jacket. 
</P>
<P>
She and others gave a boisterous hello to the city when they arrived on a 
Saturday flight from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that for Joe Montana?" she gently chided an airport porter pushing a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"No way. Go 49ers," he shot back." 
</P>
<P>
De Jon and her friends arrived early enough on Saturday to greet Rams players 
as they checked into their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got on my (Rams) colors, right down to my blue bra," De Jon boasted. 
</P>
<P>
Closet Rams fans cropped up at the unlikeliest of places. At Candlestick Park, 
where the game will be played this afternoon, groundskeeper John Gilledo, 24, 
said he was only sporting a 49er hat because he works there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Rams fan," he said. "I have a hunch that they are going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday night, 30 members of the Rams Booster Club climbed aboard a bus 
for a night of revelry. Waving a banner and blowing horns, the group charged 
into the lobby of the West Hotel at the airport, where the players are staying, 
in hopes of finding some of their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"You blew it," a hotel clerk said. "You're about an hour late." 
</P>
<P>
But they were lucky enough to find defensive back Kevin Greene, who found 
himself surrounded by well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Greene said. "We're getting great support. I'm happy to see 
all these smiling faces." 
</P>
<P>
Some Ram boosters made a stop by the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle, 
taping a banner to the window that read "Watch Out, the Rams Booster Club was 
here." They were steamed about an article in Saturday's paper describing them 
as lousy fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really mad," said Joanie Feria of Glendale. "We won't wear white shoes 
after Labor Day." That crack was in response to the article's suggestion that 
Ram fans were even bad dressers. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of non-Ram fans in town, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the Rams," said Manny Robleto, a San Francisco policeman. "I'm hoping 
it's going to be a 49er blowout." 
</P>
<P>
At the Hyatt party, 49er owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. apologized about the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry about the rainy weather," he told some Rams people. "I don't think it 
will affect the game that much. In fact, it may help the offense." 
</P>
<P>
The $40,000 party, attended by nearly 400, was for team owners, their staffs, 
sponsors, and the media. 
</P>
<P>
Someone jokingly noted the Hollywood theme and asked: Doesn't San Francisco 
know that the Rams are from Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
It was a festive mood, whatever the theme. But one element missing from the 6 
to 8 p.m. party was the players. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Beam, director of operations for the Rams, explained they were in team 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's two hours of free time, when they'll go into their hotel rooms, 
watch some TV, and play some cards. They'll have their meal at 9:30 -- 
hamburgers, fried chicken, salads, that kind of stuff -- and curfew is at 11." 
</P>
<P>
Former Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood, now a Rams broadcaster, confided he 
would rather be resting up to play in the game instead of rubbing elbows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd all like to be 28 and out there playing the game," he said. "It was a 
very exciting time for me, and right now I know the Rams are trying to relax. 
You get stressed out just trying to relax. Tomorrow morning, they will get up 
at 6 and drink six gallons of coffee, have a little breakfast and load up on 
the carbs (carbohydrates)." 
</P>
<P>
For those without tickets, the 49ers booster club was selling them for $300 
each. Some of the Rams booster club members were worried they would get tickets 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Wednesday that 18 tickets were made available to them. And that 
was only because booster president Larry Kenemore called Georgia Frontiere at 
her hotel in New York. The club actually wound up getting more tickets through 
the 49ers booster club, which made 50 tickets available at the regular price. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ram fans, Beth Fisher, 14, and her sister, Karilyn Fisher, 21, had a 
special reason for making the trip. They got a call from Coach John Robinson 
himself after the Rams beat the Giants last week. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Fisher said he told them: "Make plans for San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is engaged to their mother, Linda Fisher, owner of a modeling agency 
in Anaheim. The daughters said they think the wedding will be next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually just go to home games, so this is real exciting," Beth Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams supporters were having fun, but anxious for victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are going to be the team of the '90s," predicted Jim Ort, a charter 
member of the Booster Club. 
</P>
<P>
But most fans will likely agree with 49ers owner DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is it's going to be a great game," he said.

GOVERNOR WANTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STATE SEN. MARIAN BERGESON OF NEWPORT BEACH WILL BE INTRODUCING 
LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT DEUKMEJIAN'S CLEAR MESSAGE. 
</P>

When it comes to year-round schools, Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state 
budget contains few specifics and very little new money, but it sends a clear 
political message that the state's fiscally conservative chief executive wants 
California schools off the traditional summer-break calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not exactly sure of the specifics of this, but I think the message is 
clear: He wants us to move in that direction," Bill Honig, state superintendent 
of public instruction, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor has never taken such a strong position in use of facilities 
year-round. It's his boldest, strongest statement to date," said Charles 
Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Education. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a continuing explosion in school enrollment, Deukmejian in his 
State of the State address Monday proposed three steps pushing the state toward 
year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
Saying California schools cannot afford to "depend simply on building our way 
out of the shortage of classrooms," Deukmejian proposed increasing incentives 
to districts that switch to multitrack, year-round calendars that ensure that 
classrooms do not sit idle for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
His package also includes allocating slightly more money to reward districts 
that have multitrack, year-round schools and loosening requirements for voter 
approval of local bond measures to build year-round schools. He also proposed 
giving districts with year-round schools priority in tapping the state's pool 
of school construction funds, a plan similar to an existing law. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what effect the governor's proposals will have on the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, where year-round schools are being hotly debated as 
the district struggles to cope with massive overcrowding. About 23% of the 
district's 610,000 students already attend year-round schools, contrasted with 
only 9% of students statewide.

Sue McDougall's husband and mother had just suffered strokes when the family 
moved to the quiet hillside neighborhood along Bastanchury Road 2 1/2 years 
ago, so the quaint, terra-cotta roofed hospital just up the block gave her 
peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt comfort being able to walk to a hospital if there was an emergency," 
said McDougall, who does not drive. "I used to brag about it." 
</P>
<P>
She's not bragging any more. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, McDougall and many other residents who live around the old St. Jude 
Hospital site live in fear over the ongoing conversion of the facility into a 
psychiatric hospital that will treat depression and other mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid of people with severe mental problems being in an area like this 
with children and three schools nearby," McDougall said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have signed a petition opposing the conversion of the old 
hospital in the 16000 block of Bastanchury Road. On Saturday, about a 
half-dozen hospital opponents picketed in front of the facility during an open 
house organized to alleviate concerns and attended by more than 100 residents. 
</P>
<P>
At the last Yorba Linda City Council meeting, residents opposed to the 
psychiatric hospital asked the council to do what it could to block to 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have written letters to local schools and churches concerning the 
project and plan to take the issue back to the council, said Steven Brunette, 
who lives a few blocks from the site. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said there is little Yorba Linda can do to block the opening 
of the 80-bed facility, scheduled for mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
Because state law prohibits cities from making distinctions between psychiatric 
facilities and other types of hospitals, the conversion does not violate the 
conditional use permit granted when the facility was a general hospital, 
according to Phillip Paxton, community development director. 
</P>
<P>
First word of the conversion came in early November when the hospital, on the 
corner of Bastanchury Road and Rose Drive, was sold by Orange-based St. Joseph 
Health System to National Medical Enterprises of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
NME runs 61 psychiatric hospitals across the United States, including the Los 
Altos Hospital and Health Center in Long Beach, according to Sandra L. 
Horowitz, vice president for development at Specialty Hospital Group, an NME 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
St. Jude closed its doors Nov. 14, when preparations began for the conversion 
to the new Yorba Hills Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Mesa, administrator at both Los Altos and Yorba Hills hospitals, said 
the facility will treat people who suffer from depression, chemical dependency 
and eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Patients stay at the hospital an average of 22 days and go through treatment 
programs that include therapy sessions, education programs, family visits and 
the prescription of some drugs under the supervision of a physician, he said. 
Treatment fees run at about $600 a day, not including professional fees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of our patients, this is a timeout," Mesa said. "It's a time to sort 
out their lives." 
</P>
<P>
But many residents who live around Yorba Hills say their lives will be filled 
with anxiety if the conversion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Cosper, who regularly walks her dog past the hospital, said she 
couldn't believe it when she learned the site was going to be turned into a 
mental health center. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally obvious that it is not secure. I can't see how it can be 
properly secured," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While Cosper and other residents agree there is need for such a facility, they 
question the wisdom of placing patients who could be unpredictable and in some 
cases even violent in a suburban setting around homes and schools. They are 
also concerned about patients who have just been released from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone wanted to get out of that hospital quickly, they would get off the 
main street and onto a cul-de-sac," McDougall said. 
</P>
<P>
While Yorba Hills will have door alarms and a security guard, Mesa said the 
hospital will be just as concerned about restricting bad elements from entering 
the hospital as keeping the patients inside. 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that seriously ill or violent people are kept out of the 
hospital by a strict admissions process that screens more patients out than it 
allows in. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a state hospital or a jail," Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials and at least one councilman believed the Saturday open house 
and tour helped residents feel more comfortable about their new neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a facility that every modern community in the 20th Century 
needs," said Councilman Irwin M. Fried, who attended the Saturday open house 
where he fielded questions from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said they walked away from the open house feeling that the 
facility would not harm their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of questions answered. They satisfied me," said resident Bob 
Stewart.

Bill and Jane O'Shields-Hayner say they're not the type of people to jump on

But when their two young daughters learned that the Share Our Selves charity 
was being forced out of its lease, and insisted that the family make an effort

Saturday rally to show their support for SOS. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought it was important -- we shouldn't ignore it," said 11-year-old 
Rebekah. "I don't know how someone could think with such a cruel mind, that 
they don't want to look at these people." 
</P>
<P>
The family joined almost 1,000 others Saturday under gray skies on the soggy 
park grass near the Rea Community Center to show solidarity for the 20-year-old 
agency, which offers food, clothing and assistance to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, amid growing discontent about SOS among its neighbors, the City 
Council voted to cancel the charity's lease at the city-managed center, and 
gave SOS six months to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, SOS has raised $300,000 in donations to relocate, and has appealed 
to the council to extend its lease a few months, rather than force it to move 
to a temporary location, and then move again to its permanent site. The council 
denied that request two weeks ago, but on Monday will again take up the issue, 
as well as Mayor Peter F. Buffa's proposal to help settle SOS in a commercial 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Those attending the afternoon rally seemed determined to save the charity, 
despite the imposing political and financial struggles, as well as about 40 
counterdemonstration picketers at the entrance to the park area, who flashed 
placards with a circle and red line through "SOS." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a dream too," Jean Forbath, executive director of SOS, told the crowd, 
in reference to the Monday holiday marking the birthday of slain civil rights 
leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "We'll get through this . . . and make a 
difference in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask ourselves, 'Why are people hungry? Why are people homeless? Why 
do people have to line up at SOS for the little we can give them?' " she asked 
those who sat wrapped in blankets or stood drinking hot coffee and tea amid the 
drizzle and blustery wind. 
</P>
<P>
As supporters listened to the speeches of SOS organizers, prayers of religious 
leaders and an acoustic guitar player strumming folk and protest songs, they 
applauded and shouted approval. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy McCoy of Costa Mesa sat on a blanket rocking her sleeping 6-month-old 
daughter, Lauren, snuggled in a blanket and fuzzy knit cap. McCoy describes 
herself as usually "passive" about political and social issues, but said the 
SOS story moved her and her husband, David, to action. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been listening to the City Council meetings, and I just think it stinks 
what they're doing," McCoy said. "It comes down to, where are these people 
going to go? I think if anybody really looks at themselves, they would realize 
that it wouldn't take much for any one of us to be in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
The picketers on the other side of the issue, who police say protested without 
incident, insist that SOS should be moved to a non-residential area, where the 
homeless and hungry won't infringe on the safety and serenity of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not against the homeless, we're for our neighborhoods," said Lee 
Litterell, who has lived in the area near SOS for six years. "We just want them 
to go to an industrial-type area, where most Skid Rows are. We don't want to be 
the Skid Row of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
After the rally, about 150 supporters of SOS walked the nearly three miles to 
City Hall, where a few dozen began a 50-hour fast and sleep-over that they plan 
to continue until the council meets Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Forbath: "Even though we're not going to suffer very much, we offer it 
(the hunger strike) as a token of what we feel is a beginning, a small 
beginning."

A RUN IN THE RAIN TO SHELTER THE HOMELESS;

<P>
As cars whizzed by and a heavy downpour of wind-whipped rain drenched him 
Saturday morning, runner Keith Witthaver began thinking about dropping out of 
the half-marathon through the rolling landscape near the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
Rain had fallen steadily since the beginning of the race, and Witthaver's 
T-shirt had become so wet that he had to toss it off midway through because it 
was weighing him down during the Second Annual Orange County Half-Marathon and 
Run for Homeless Children. 
</P>
<P>
"By about six miles, I realized I wasn't clocking the time I wanted," Witthaver 
said later, as he stood below ominous dark clouds. "But I also realized I had 
no ride back either." 
</P>
<P>
Witthaver -- dressed only in black spandex shorts and shoes and looking as 
though he had just stepped out of a swimming pool -- finished the race, placing 
fourth in the 13.1-mile half-marathon. He was among an estimated 760 people 
who, despite the stormy skies, turned out for the event along the hills and 
roads of Irvine to benefit homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
Run organizers said that 1,100 people registered for the race, but the rain 
kept many away. Further, a scheduled wheelchair race had to be canceled because 
only one contestant showed up, according to race director Kim Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
About 850 people attended last year's event, which raised $3,000 for Christian 
Temporary Housing Facilities Inc. Winslow said this run also raised about 
$3,000, which will pay for 400 days of shelter for a homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
A one-mile run/walk that began around 8 a.m. was detoured because, as one race 
worker put it, part of the route "turned into a river." 
</P>
<P>
Said Winslow of the confusion: "I think some of the one-mile people ended up 
going two miles." 
</P>
<P>
Several runners described the morning event as having the worst weather they'd 
ever run in. 
</P>
<P>
The half-marathon, the main event of Saturday's runs, started amid heavy 
showers, but as the fastest runners reached the home stretch, the rain stopped 
and the sun began to shine on the sea of umbrellas bunched around the finish 
line area. 
</P>
<P>
But it could have been worse, one participant said. 
</P>
<P>
"Running in the rain is better than doing a whole triathlon," said Nancy Stark 
of Denver as she walked toward he car to change out of her drenched workout 
gear. "Can you imagine biking in the rain?" 
</P>
<P>
Different runners had different ways of dealing with the inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first few miles, I jumped over the puddles," said Witthaver, who lives 
in Apple Valley. "After a while, it became a futile attempt." 
</P>
<P>
Like Witthaver, several other fast runners stripped down to as few clothes as 
possible in order to avoid being slowed down while others farther back in the 
pack chose to bundle up. 
</P>
<P>
"They're racers, we're joggers," said Tim Hurlbut of Laguna Niguel, explaining 
why he wore a jacket throughout the race. "For us, it's survival." 
</P>
<P>
The races were designed both to raise money and focus more attention on the 
homeless of Orange County, Winslow said. 
</P>
<P>
She admitted the rain caused its share of problems but added: "It was 
interesting to see how the volunteers and runners reacted to being 
inconvenienced (by the elments). Homeless people have to deal with that 
inconvenience every day. They don't have a place to live."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY WOMAN TO RUN L.A. UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: LILLIAN KAWASAKI IS THE FIRST ASIAN-AMERICAN TO HEAD A CITY OF LOS 
ANGELES DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Fountain Valley woman has become the first Asian-American to be named as head 
of a city of Los Angeles department. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Kawasaki, 39, who has worked for the Los Angeles Harbor Department 
since 1978, was named by Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday to head the new Department 
of Environmental Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The department, created last spring over Bradley's opposition, will have an 
initial annual budget of $1 million and a staff of 20. Kawasaki's salary will 
be $82,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley opposed creation of the department out of fear it would set off turf 
wars among departments, many of which have some responsibility for 
environmental matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Friday that Kawasaki will be the city's "principal educator" on 
environmental matters. "We hope to have her deliver the message to the public 
so that they will get involved in the efforts of the 1990s as we engage in a 
vigorous environmental program in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"She has worked with many of the city agencies and that is going to be one of 
her assignments," Bradley said. "We hope that this cooperative effort is going 
to give us the best attack on the problems that confront us." 
</P>
<P>
She will be the first Asian-American to be appointed general manager of a 
department, although others have served as acting bureau heads, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki is not well-known among environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sulnick, executive director of the American Oceans Campaign, who 
strongly endorsed creation of the new city office, said he was not familiar 
with Kawasaki. He said he had hoped that a well-known environmentalist would be 
named to the post. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us were asked or included in the process that I'm aware of," Sulnick 
said. "But, I'm not trying to be negative. This may be a wonderful appointment. 
I simply don't know. But I have great hope for the agency." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Nichols, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council offices 
in Los Angeles, said: "She's as good a choice as you could have found within 
the city family." Nichols said Kawasaki was picked from among several 
candidates "based on her abilities as an environmental manager, as opposed to 
being an environmental advocate." Nichols agreed that few in the environmental 
movement know much about Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki said the new department will coordinate city environmental measures 
and "guide, support and really strengthen the city's commitment to improving 
the citizens' quality of life."

FOR ONCE, GIBSON IS HOLDING BACK; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: 1988 MVP RECOVERING FROM UNUSUAL SURGERY BY WORKING HARD IN MICHIGAN, 
BUT HE ISN'T TESTING HIS LEG COMPLETELY YET. LIFE WITHOUT BASEBALL DOESN'T 
SCARE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It takes one hour 10 minutes. Kirk Gibson knows the drive well. He says it is 
the same whether it is snowing or sleeting or so cold his beard stubble freezes 
on the way to the pickup truck. It is the same whether he has a cold or the flu 
or a bad case -- highly contagious this time of year -- of wanting to take a 
nap in front of the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a week this winter, Gibson spends one hour 10 minutes traveling 
from his farmhouse north of Detroit to East Lansing, home of Michigan State 
University. Waiting for him is an empty gym with an overstuffed challenge. 
</P>
<P>
In silence, Gibson stretches. He rides a stationary bike. He runs. He sticks 
his bad left hamstring under the strain of a Cybex machine. He runs. He fits 
the rest of his body under a weight machine. He runs. After 4 1/2 hours in 
solitary, he climbs back in his truck and hopes to get home before the roads 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Some may think the worst part is how it begins, at 7 a.m., with Gibson 
searching for a fresh pair of sweat pants, then stumbling outside to warm up 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson says no. The worst part of the process is that he has no idea how it 
will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I have never worked harder during a winter in my life," Gibson said, 
"But what the end result will be, I don't know. I honestly don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his best efforts, the Dodger outfielder said he is uncertain if he will 
fully recover from the tricky operation last Aug. 29 that repaired a torn 
hamstring in a tendon just below his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
It is a month before the start of spring training, and Gibson's leg is not yet 
strong enough to be baseball-tested. He might not pick up a ball until the 
beginning of drills next month. He will probably not attempt to play a full 
game until the end of spring training, if that soon. 
</P>
<P>
His progress has been such that he only began to simulate baserunning for the 
first time Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran from first to second three times and then I said, 'easy,' " said Gibson, 
the National League's most valuable player two years ago, in a phone 
conversation earlier this week. "It felt good, but I didn't want to rush it. I 
haven't run in five months; I'm not going to be a madman." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said there is no pain. But because he tried to play with the injury last 
year and batted a career-low .213 in 71 games, there is caution. And because 
the injury was unique -- Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director, had never 
seen a hamstring tear in that tendon area -- there will be no pushing into the 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Time, and only time, will tell what happens to me," Gibson said. "I'm not 
going to consider myself back until I can help the team on a consistent basis. 
And who knows if I can? Nobody has that answer right now. I'd be God if I told 
you I knew." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe says Gibson's attitude is a wise one. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we've never seen an injury quite like this, it would be pushing to try 
to know something early," Jobe said. "If he decides he wants to go through 
spring training without trying to demonstrate his superior ability, that 
wouldn't make me mad. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, because of when he had the surgery, it should just have healed solid 
by the start of the season. We probably won't have our answer until then." 
</P>
<P>
But Gibson, who will become a free agent at the end of this season, said he is 
not waiting that long to develop contingency plans. In keeping with his 
black-and-white view of his world, he calls them Plans A, B and C. 
</P>
<P>
"Plan A, I'm totally healthy on a consistent basis. That's what I really want," 
he explained. "We won't know that until we get into the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Plan B, I'm partially healthy, so you go figure out what happens then. I mean, 
I don't think the Dodgers are going to want to pay me to be a pinch-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Gibson, 32, would try to move to the American League as a 
designated hitter, either by asking for a trade before the end of the season or 
by playing out his contract. He was told that if that should be the case, 
rumors would soon be circulating of his return to Detroit to be united with 
former football foe Bo Schembechler, the Tigers' new president. 
</P>
<P>
The former Michigan State football star laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how much I admire and respect Bo," he said. "And who knows 
what is going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Plan C. "That comes into play if I don't get any better, and they 
kick me out of the game entirely," he said. "I just retire. And, hey, man, I'm 
not married to the game. I could handle retirement." 
</P>
<P>
When he has not been working out this winter, he has been working for his 
successful real estate development company. Friends say he is just as obsessed 
with that as with baseball, doing everything from personally checking the 
wiring and plumbing in buildings to selling the leases on those buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a position where I can take care of myself and my family after 
baseball," Gibson said. "Life goes on, and we have to go on with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' plan, of course, is for Gibson to be starting somewhere in the 
outfield on opening day. But they, too, are treading lightly. Witness the 
recent free-agent signing of outfielder Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk is the only one who can truly tell us how he feels, and we will bring him 
along at a pace for which he feels comfortable," Dodger Vice President Fred 
Claire said. "We know what he can do; we aren't going to make him show us in 
spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda: "I believe he's coming back, but do I know? 
No. So I just want him to take his time. A veteran with his background, he 
knows what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' patience has been strengthened by the news that outfielder Kal 
Daniels has recovered so well from his Aug. 21 arthroscopic surgery that he was 
recently playing basketball. Well, maybe they weren't thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Kal that he was too short to be playing hoops, and the Lakers had all 
the help they needed," Claire said. "I think he got the message." 
</P>
<P>
Protested Daniels from his home in Warner Robins, Ga.: "Hey, I'm fine. I'm able 
to do everything now. I'm running sprints up hills, working out five days a 
week. I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Gibson is fully recuperated, Daniels believes he will be in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to figure they will make a move in the infield somewhere," he said, 
referring to a possible trade of third baseman Jeff Hamilton, with Brooks 
moving to third base. "I don't think they traded for me not to play me." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said he wishes he could be as cheerful. But although arthroscopic knee 
surgery is seemingly performed every 10 seconds in this country, Gibson's 
hamstring tear was one that forced Jobe to dust off his textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very unusual," Jobe explained. "In almost all cases, the 
hamstring simply tears in the muscle. His tore in the tendon. We've never seen 
that before. He must have hit something very hard or played very hard for that 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Gibson is working just as hard to fix it. His agent, Doug 
Baldwin, made a pre-Christmas visit to Gibson's home in hopes of sharing a 
little holiday cheer. What he and Gibson actually shared was the cold front 
seat of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
"First day I'm there, we're up at about dawn, piling into his truck and making 
that long drive to Michigan State," Baldwin related. "It's cold and snowy, and 
then when we get to the gym, there's not a soul in sight. I end up following 
him through his workout the whole morning, and it's like he has tunnel vision. 
He doesn't see or think or talk about anything but his workout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time he's had surgery on his bread and butter -- his legs -- 
and I really think that has him obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gibson: "Basically, I can't be stopped. When it's snowing and I'm sick, it 
would be so easy to mess around and stay home . . . But when I'm sick is when I 
work harder. I do extra weights, to help tell myself I'm OK. It's fun. It's 
part of the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
His love of challenges, according to Gibson, is what has made him stay in 
baseball this long. 
</P>
<P>
"'What is keeping me around is the competition," Gibson said. "I love it. I got 
to have it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need any more personal achievements. . . . I just want to win. That's 
my reward. That's why I'm putting myself through all this. More W's." 
</P>
<P>
He has earned many of those, the best of which were helped by his dramatic home 
runs in the 1984 and '88 World Series. Kirk Gibson only wishes a victory over 
his left leg would be as easy. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dodgers have five players eligible for arbitration, and those 
still unsigned by Tuesday's deadline will file to protect themselves, all five 
will probably sign before their cases reach an arbitrator. The most likely to 
have problems with management, Kal Daniels, is coming off an injury-plagued 
year that has sufficiently confused his case so neither his agent, Lou 
Oppenheim, nor the Dodgers would want to test an arbitrator. "If we go, it 
would be a crapshoot, and I think they feel the same way," Oppenheim said. 
"Both sides are probably too insecure about their positions to want to risk it 
to an arbitrator." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels followed three seasons of a .291 average or better with a .246 average 
in 55 games with Cincinnati and the Dodgers. Daniels, whose $325,000 salary 
last season was determined by a coin flip between him and owner Marge Schott of 
the Cincinnati Reds, will probably settle more quietly this time. Other Dodgers 
eligible for arbitration are third baseman Jeff Hamilton, catcher Rick Dempsey, 
utility player Franklin Stubbs and pitcher Ray Searage. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' biggest contract problem will probably occur this spring with 
pitcher Tim Belcher, who is not eligible for arbitration. Because he couldn't 
come to agreement with the club last season, he was automatically renewed for 
$225,000. Earlier this winter, Belcher said he expects the same problem this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ignore any trade rumors involving Hubie Brooks. Claire confirmed that a 
little-known clause in the basic agreement between management and the union 
prevents teams from trading their newly signed free agents until the following 
June.

ACTIVIST CASOLO GOES FROM SALVADOR JAIL TO MEDIA TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10 minutes on CNN's "Sonya Live" television talk show passed by all too 
quickly for Jennifer Casolo, the American imprisoned in El Salvador for 18 days 
on charges she hid weapons for leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish, I wish, I wish I'd said more important things!" she moaned after 
abandoning the set at Cable News Network's Hollywood studio. "Instead of taking 
an opportunity and throwing it away!" 
</P>
<P>
But rarely does Casolo throw away opportunities these days. 
</P>
<P>
In a few short weeks she has gone from political prisoner to virtual media 
star. Scarcely a month ago, she was captive in a country torn by civil war; 
today she is crisscrossing the United States on an 11-city speaking tour, 
negotiating movie and book deals and making the rounds of the talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
An NBC camera crew trails her all over Los Angeles. Stars and activists from 
the Hollywood entertainment industry court her at parties. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is a role Casolo, a tiny, Bible-quoting woman with a quick smile, 
embraces willingly -- but not, she says, without reservation. 
</P>
<P>

Thrust Into Limelight 
</P>
<P>
"Because I've been thrust here, I have to speak," she says. "This position, of 
being the center of attention, is the most difficult thing I've ever had to do 
in my life. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said, 'Go, speak.' It was the door that was opened up. So I thought, 
go, do it." 
</P>
<P>
Her critics are angry Casolo is afforded such a platform. She maintains her 
purpose is to tell the American public what she witnessed in 4 1/2 years of 
life and work in El Salvador. She would prefer to turn the focus on the plight 
of the Salvadorans, not on herself, she says. But, sure, if her story can make 
a little money, that's OK, too. Money, she says, to help "reconstruct" El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
So far, an entertainment attorney working for former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey 
Clark, who was enlisted by Casolo's associates when she was first jailed, has 
received approximately 10 movie offers, Clark said in a telephone interview 
from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem to be a terrific story," Clark said. "Church people working in a 
country like that, where priests are getting killed, guns are being found in 
your back yard. All sorts of things go on." 
</P>
<P>
"The question," says Casolo, "is whether it (a movie) can be done with 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador, Casolo worked for a San Antonio-based group called Christian 
Education Seminars. She coordinated visits to El Salvador by delegations of 
church workers and congressional aides, arranging their schedules and escorting 
them to meet with representatives of diverse sectors, from military leaders to 
peasant organizers. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 25, in the midst of the largest offensive ever launched by Marxist-led 
Salvadoran rebels, Casolo's work came to a crashing halt. A squadron of police 
raided the home she rented in a San Salvador suburb and allegedly unearthed a 
huge arms cache containing more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades, 
explosives and bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the weapons were buried in Casolo's walled back yard to await 
delivery to the guerrillas. Casolo, who says she buried personal items such as 
papers and cassettes in her garden, but not weapons, was taken to jail. 
</P>
<P>
After several days of interrogation at the hands of 20 or more National Police 
officers, she was arraigned on three terrorism counts and transferred to the 
Ilopango Women's Prison on the outskirts of San Salvador. She always maintained 
her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Coming 10 days after six Jesuit priests were murdered by gunmen later alleged 
to be members of the military, Casolo's case attracted wide publicity. Her 
supporters contended she had been framed as a way to discredit church work. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater practically pronounced her guilty. (He 
later apologized for his comments.) 
</P>
<P>
Finally, citing lack of evidence, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani 
announced Casolo would be released and deported. But, he added, he remained 
"morally convinced" of her guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo was taken from prison and put aboard a flight to Miami on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I told President Cristiani that if she (was expelled from El Salvador) and 
came back here, there would probably be a speaking tour, and it might not be in 
their best interest," Clark, who tried to persuade the government to allow 
Casolo to remain in El Salvador, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say much but he certainly understood it. I told him how powerful the 
networking of the church seems to be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Her Story 
</P>
<P>
Casolo and her handlers, including a New York City public relations firm, chose 
Los Angeles to launch the speaking tour, which will take the 28-year-old 
Connecticut native to 11 cities in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a media center, a media capital of the world," said Sister Pat 
Krommer, a Roman Catholic nun who heads the Humanitarian Law Project. "All the 
(television) networks are here, there's a major newspaper. . . . We felt it was 
the logical place to begin." 
</P>
<P>
Casolo left Los Angeles for San Francisco on Friday, and her next stop is 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Krommer, who is also on the board of Christian Education Seminars, is 
organizing and sponsoring the series of engagements, along with the Office of 
the Americas, a Los Angeles-based group opposed to U.S. intervention in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Budget for the tour is $41,000, a bill that was footed by a private donor whom 
Krommer declined to identify. Other money is being raised at several of 
Casolo's appearances, which will go to Christian Education Seminars and to 
Casolo herself, Krommer said. 
</P>
<P>
At a fund-raising dessert party at the Beverly Hills home of Talli Wyler, the 
widow of film director William Wyler, television actor Robert Foxworth, 
formerly of "Falcon Crest," made the pitch for donations, and collection 
baskets were passed around. 
</P>
<P>
Much bigger money, of course, would be generated by a movie. Experts in the 
industry believe Casolo could probably sell her story, but development of a 
full-length movie would depend on a complete story line, drama, characters, 
romance and resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"Headlines aren't enough. . . . There has to be a back story, and there has to 
be a big finish," said Barbara Corday, until last week executive vice president 
for prime-time programming at CBS Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a true-life story based on a real incident that got a lot of press has to 
stand up as a good movie on its own in order to get made. Millions of people 
will not remember this happened a year from now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations of Guilt 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe Casolo to be guilty are outraged at the amount of attention 
she is receiving. They accuse her of trying to manipulate public opinion to 
exonerate herself of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy in Media, a conservative organization that monitors the press, has 
been tracking Casolo's tour. In each city she visits, Accuracy in Media offers 
reporters pages of material to outline the case against her. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence linking Jennifer Casolo to the arms cache found in her garden is 
strong, and there is abundant reason to doubt her self-portrayal as a religious 
pacifist with no political agenda," the organization said in a news bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
During an appearance on Michael Jackson's radio talk show on KABC, the comments 
from listeners were divided evenly between the sympathetic and the critical -- 
including one man who suggested many church workers in El Salvador are 
communists. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo also says she has received a small amount of threatening hate mail. 
</P>
<P>
But just about everywhere she went last week, Casolo's articulate, careful and 
seemingly rehearsed story-telling apparently impressed -- even inspired -- many 
in her audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Few question her commitment. Some suggest she may be naive. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo says she always tried to keep her opinions to herself while she was 
working in El Salvador, that she tried to serve as a "bridge" between visiting 
delegations and the Salvadorans, so that visitors could see a complete, 
unadulterated, multifaceted picture of a complex country. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, her opposition to the right-wing Salvadoran government and to 
U.S. support of it has become clear. Her politics seem to color some of her 
analyses. For example, though she condemns violence from all sides, she is 
eloquent criticizing the military but falters when asked to comment on 
controversial tactics employed by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
guerrillas in their recent urban offensive. 
</P>
<P>
And it is evident that she empathizes with what many see as a class struggle in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"My sympathies are with the poor and those who try to be peacemakers. If that's 
enough to get me in prison, then that's an honor, too," she told The Times in 
an interview last month inside prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I identify completely with the suffering of the Salvadoran people. I used to 
be ashamed of being poor when I grew up, embarrassed at my clothes. I learned 
through the Salvadoran people that poverty is not the result of individual 
failings but a result of unjust structures." 
</P>
<P>
Casolo has admitted she buried personal items in her back yard, but she 
contends they were placed in a part of the garden apart from where the weapons 
were allegedly found. The items include tapes of Latin American protest music, 
written proposals for development projects such as a clinic and a chicken coop, 
and manuals that instruct peasants on how to make posters and pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was necessary to hide the items to keep them out of the hands of 
army troops who, as part of a crackdown on the church and on dissidents, were 
raiding the homes and offices of numerous foreign church workers and 
missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming Politicized 
</P>
<P>
During its investigation, the military released a videotape that it said showed 
the excavation of Casolo's back yard the night of the raid on her house. The 
tape, which has several interruptions, covered a portion of the raid showing 
weapons being removed from a large, deep tunnel-like cavity, along with items 
that officials said belonged to Casolo. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the items Casolo admits burying are the same items the 
military claims they removed from the tunnel. Casolo said last week she had not 
yet seen the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
That Casolo, an honors graduate from Brandeis University, would end up in El 
Salvador is the result of both happenstance and design. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a high school Spanish teacher who imparted the "social realities" 
of Latin America, Casolo says she planned her life to include a year of college 
study in Spain and then, after graduation, work in a Latin American country. 
What she did not count on was that the Latin American country would be El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go to a dangerous place," she said, describing her motives 
after graduating from Brandeis in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my jeans jacket, my scarf from Europe, and I barely believed in Jesus. I 
didn't want to join one of these Christian-y groups. I didn't want to join the 
Peace Corps and become an instrument of Reagan policy. I wasn't very political, 
but I knew enough to know that I didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
She turned to the Brethren Volunteers Service of Elgin, Ill., social-action arm 
of the pacifist Church of the Brethren, known for its draft resistance during 
the Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
The Brethren dispatched Casolo to Seattle to work with Salvadoran refugees. 
Living on the third floor of a church with 23 refugees, Casolo said, she helped 
them get free dental and medical care, attended PTA meetings and, most 
importantly, helped fill out their applications for political asylum in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing their tales of torture, rape and repression at the hands of Salvadoran 
authorities persuaded Casolo that she should work in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cries of the Imprisoned 
</P>
<P>
"I met people who had faced death and lived, and I wasn't so afraid anymore," 
she said. "I felt I could not separate myself, as a U.S. citizen, from the war 
that was happening there. . . . I didn't know what I was going to find in El 
Salvador. I wasn't going down as a radical. I just wanted to do something for 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
What happened over the next years, she said, was not a process of 
radicalization as much as a "deepening of understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The story Casolo most often tells when she speaks to groups involves an 
interrogation, three days into her arrest, and the young police lieutenant who 
became her foil. 
</P>
<P>
She was placed in a so-called "hairy room," a 6-foot-by-6-foot cell where the 
floor and walls were covered with shag carpeting for soundproofing. It was one 
of eight such cubicles lined up in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo says she could watch other prisoners -- Salvadorans -- blindfolded, 
shoeless, being led into adjoining booths. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't witness the interrogations," she tells one audience as she fights 
back tears. "I heard them. From the soundproof rooms, I could hear the cries, 
the moans, the screams. I could hear flesh hitting flesh. Furniture hitting 
flesh. Choking. Vomiting." 
</P>
<P>
A consular officer from the U.S. Embassy who visited her regularly brought her 
a deck of cards. She says she taught some of her jailers card tricks and games. 
</P>
<P>
One night she was playing the card game Concentration with four of her guards, 
when word spread that "The Lieutenant" was coming. Quickly, they gathered the 
cards and put them away. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, fair-haired lieutenant entered her cell with two other 
officers and began what Casolo described as a good-cop, bad-cop routine. The 
lieutenant wore a T-shirt with a picture of the Tasmanian Devil cartoon 
character wearing jammers and dark shades. The label "Sun Devil" was printed on 
the shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"His first question to me was, 'What does "Sun Devil" mean?' " Casolo said. She 
told him -- "Diablo del Sol" -- then produced her own T-shirt, which protested 
a nuclear plant at Diablo Canyon. Her shirt said, "No Diablo." 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of set the terms for the night," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbol of Love 
</P>
<P>
The night wore on, with questions repeated endlessly. Who gave her the weapons? 
Where did they come from? Endlessly, she repeated she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
When at some point during the night, the screams in the next booth became 
louder than she could bear, Casolo said she closed her eyes and settled into a 
meditative position. Tears streamed down her face. She repeated the vows of a 
nun who asked God to let her be a symbol of what it means to love. 
</P>
<P>
The police accused her of crying for her "terrorist friends." She responded 
they were the same tears she would shed for any of them. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the lieutenant ordered his men to halt the beatings of the prisoner 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the conversation changed, she said. She and the lieutenant shared 
stories of their families, of what it was like to grow up poor, of how, in 
their own ways, each had tried to forge ahead and do more with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw his humanity," Casolo said. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo says she is concerned that her current national tour could go to her 
head, make her forget what she says are the values of humility that she learned 
in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge now is to maintain those values and operate in this 
medium," she said. To do so, she plans to join a "faith community" in 
Washington, living a modest life in humble surroundings with other activists, 
talking of peace and eating rice and beans. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that will keep me faithful," she said.

LAPD'S BRASS PUSH GATES TO QUIT, MAKE ROOM AT TOP

<P>
After a failed political bid and missed appointments to top federal law 
enforcement jobs, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates is a man caught 
between his own ambition and the desires of his top brass to advance in the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Gates is concluding his 12th year as chief even as serious crimes have reached 
an all-time high in Los Angeles and a major expansion and upgrading of police 
facilities and manpower is under way. But he is surrounded by lieutenants, 
commanders and deputy chiefs in the 8,000-officer force whose future with the 
department depends on his stepping aside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a continuing dilemma," Gates said of the would-be chiefs who are nipping 
at his heels. "I am not going to stay forever. I don't have a specific 
(departure) date in mind, but clearly these concerns are in my head. I'm not 
blind to them." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, many of whom spoke only on condition that their names not be used, 
said Gates' uncertainty about his own future has damaged morale and stifled 
innovation in the department at a time when street crime is foremost among 
problems facing the city. Department officials jockeying for the top position 
said there is a new reluctance to take law enforcement risks that, if they 
fail, might jeopardize their standing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling among progressive, ambitious people in the department that 
Gates should step aside," said one lieutenant, expressing a commonly held view 
in the department. "There are people at lower levels who could do a great job 
and may not get the opportunity unless he leaves." 
</P>
<P>
A police commander added: "Certainly, if the chief left it would mean major 
movement at the upper ranks, which would mean a lot of other (new) positions 
(would become available). Career advancement? We certainly don't have much of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' reluctance to either move on or firmly declare his intent to stay has 
created a "brewing frustration in the department," said one prominent city 
official who asked that his name not be used. "What you are witnessing here is 
promotional gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Others, outside the department, were more blunt in their appraisal of Gates' 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"Gates left the Police Department a year ago, only his physical presence 
remains," said Barbara Schlei, a former police commissioner who has frequently 
locked horns with the chief over policy. Although Schlei insisted that she 
admires Gates' personal charm, intelligence and concern for his officers, she 
added: "It is time for the issues to be addressed by a full-time chief whose 
heart and soul and total attention is on the day-to-day workings of LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Gates -- a vigorous man who looks much younger than his 62 
years -- is that there are few jobs to which he can aspire. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do after you've been marshal of Dodge City?" asked Eric Rose, 
spokesman for Gates during the chief's abortive campaign for governor last 
year. "It's tough and it's a question that only Daryl Gates can answer." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Gates said he will stay in the department 
another "five years at the outer limits" and asserted that he is being 
encouraged by "some of the top people in the community" to explore a possible 
run for mayor "if something happens" to embattled Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't written it off," Gates said, "but I told them it would really take a 
real strong outpouring of strength in the city for me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Gates was waiting for the same sort of outpouring of support last year when he 
dismantled his exploratory campaign for governor. Meanwhile, speculation that 
he would be offered an appointment in the Bush Administration as drug czar or 
chief of the FBI remained just that. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it from top supporters of Bush, some people who I know are involved in 
making decisions on some of those positions," Gates said. "When I would hear 
those stories, I told my wife, 'You know? I'm scared to death because I can't 
turn the President down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gates now says the only Washington jobs he would have considered under the Bush 
Administration were "drug czar and head of the CIA." Yet, the 40-year police 
veteran said he is keeping his options open. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would consider leaving the department for a job with a major 
corporation, Gates said: "Yeah, I could if it were the right kind of job, the 
right kind of paycheck, that's a possibility. Somebody must offer me a job." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' inability to chart a course and stick with it has frustrated current and 
former allies. When he became chief in 1978, Gates said he told the Police 
Commission that he would not stay longer than "three to four years." Four years 
later, Gates told colleagues he was interested in running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Gates said he would consider leaving the force after the Los Angeles 
Summer Olympics. In 1987, he suggested that he would leave after Pope John Paul 
II's visit to Los Angeles. In 1988, he reversed himself and talked of breaking 
former Chief William H. Parker's tenure of 16 years. Early last year, he began 
his brief flirtation with gubernatorial politics, saying he would consider a 
spot on the Republican ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"I really did think very seriously about retiring after the Olympics," Gates 
said. "I sat back and sat on the beach, thought about it, got cold chills, 
said, 'Do I really want to leave?' and came back full of vigor." 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis, now a Republican state senator 
representing the San Fernando Valley, said of his one-time protege: "If Daryl 
has made a mistake it was saying 'I'll stay until the end of the (1984) 
Olympics,' then say he would stay on for a few years." 
</P>
<P>
"If you are the leader of 10 people or 10,000 people," Davis said, "there 
shouldn't be any ambiguity about whether or not you will be the boss." 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, Davis said William H. Parker, who died in 1966 after 16 
years as chief, "never gave any indication that he would do anything other than 
be chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
"Parker was a formidable presence and we thought he would be chief forever, 
literally," Davis said. "When he died, I went over to City Hall and looked to 
see whether the plexiglass (over his portrait) was fogging up." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Parker, when Davis became chief in 1969, he told the Police 
Commission, "I wouldn't stay longer than eight years. . . . After eight years, 
I would be (creating) a museum to Ed Davis." Davis missed his prediction only 
slightly, remaining chief for a total of nine years. As for Gates as a mayoral 
contender, Davis said: "He's a good administrator and he's honest. But he first 
must assess whether (voters) are willing to elect a conservative Republican, 
Anglo, Mormon ex-cop. If they are, great, go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Gates insisted that his own polls indicated that he would have been a 
formidable candidate in the last mayoral election. "I could beat (City 
Councilman Zev) Yaroslavsky, I could beat everybody. I couldn't beat the 
mayor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we known the facts of the unfolding Bradley drama I think they would have 
voted me in overwhelmingly just to have integrity in government," Gates said, 
calling attention to the controversy that has erupted over the mayor's 
financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Political insiders familiar with Gates said that a conservative Republican 
would have a very tough time being elected mayor of Los Angeles because of the 
city's ethnic diversity and liberal electorate, which includes large blocs of 
Jewish, black and Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
These observers said, however, that Gates' name recognition and statewide 
popularity would make him a potentially viable candidate for governor. But 
publicly he has expressed little interest lately in revitalizing his dismantled 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who earns $145,846 a year and has been chief longer than any other major 
city police chief still on the job, lately has curbed what was widely viewed as 
his confrontational, shoot-from-the-lip style. 
</P>
<P>
Once at loggerheads with the mayor and city officials over dwindling budgets 
for police operations and with community activists over his sometimes 
provocative words and actions, Gates has managed to mend fences with many of 
his adversaries. The more cordial atmosphere has helped him win increased 
support from the City Council. That, combined with the passage a year ago of 
local Proposition 2, which provided $176 million to upgrade Police Department 
facilities, has enabled Gates to make much-needed -- albeit belated -- 
improvements in the department's manpower and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years as chief of this department we didn't move anywhere because, in 
my judgment, the political leadership of this city was in a non-movement mode 
-- and that clearly impacted the Police Department," Gates said. "Budgets got 
to be so routine, I hardly looked at the budgets. There was no enthusiasm for 
doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gates said, "I'm excited about some of the things happening in the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Police Department is anticipating construction of a new academy, 
expansion of existing stations, renovation of department computer systems and 
the introduction of new forensic technologies such as DNA genetic printing. 
Experts predict that this technology may someday supplant finger-printing as a 
method of making positive identifications. 
</P>
<P>
Among Gates' most important accomplishments in recent years, according to 
Deputy Chief Glen Levant, was the creation of a gang-suppression program that 
targets gang members for narcotics prosecutions. "That program has resulted in 
a 98% filing rate and a 94% conviction rate," Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the same program, more than 24,000 people have been arrested for sales of 
drugs since January, 1988, and "over 8,000 people identified as gang members 
have had criminal cases built on them for narcotics violations, which takes 
them off the streets for a long time," Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' primary legacy, however, may be the creation of the Special Weapons and 
Tactics unit (SWAT) and the widely hailed Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
(DARE) program, which uses police officers to instruct Los Angeles grade school 
students about the perils of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates also has drawn criticism for efforts such as his use of a huge 
battering ram to smash through suspected drug houses and "Operation Hammer," 
which places hundreds of officers on the streets of crime-heavy neighborhoods 
to exert pressure on gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say police sweeps do not really solve the problem and amount to a waste 
of time and manpower. Gates said they let decent people get at least one night 
of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Even within the department the value of such operations is debated. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang sweeps are a hokey publicity deal," said one high-ranking official in the 
department. "Inevitably, they will create martyrs -- they'll pick up an Eagle 
Scout on his way to a Rhodes scholarship tryout." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all these efforts, statistics indicate that Gates may be losing the war 
on crime. 
</P>
<P>
The department's summary of crimes committed last year shows that 324,486 major 
crimes were committed in the city, compared to 299,910 in 1988 -- an increase 
of 8.2% spurred by narcotics trafficking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented 303 people were slain in gang-related killings in the city in 
1989, nearly an 18% increase over the record 257 slayings recorded in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those dismal statistics, Gates remains optimistic that his programs, 
along with increased public concern, heavier enforcement and stiffer sentences 
for criminals eventually will turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
These days, in fact, Gates is talking about ambitious plans to dramatically 
reduce crime across the United States by cutting down on drug and alcohol 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always going to have crime, but I'm confident this country could reduce 
its crime load by 60% to 70% to 80% -- I truly believe that," Gates said. "I 
think the first step is to create a drug-free America. All you have to do is 
look at the interlacing of alcohol and crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at that, and you can see that if you can raise a generation that's 
drug free and abuse-free from alcohol, you'll reduce crime by 40% to 50% right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving that goal would require an unprecedented "partnership between the 
private sector, communities and governments to realistically look at these 
kinds of problems and come in with the organizational and entrepreneurial 
expertise that we have in America." 
</P>
<P>
Unless such a partnership is realized, Gates predicted a violent "pulling apart 
as a nation of haves and have nots." 
</P>
<P>
"And I think sometimes those have-nots are going to say enough is enough," 
Gates said. "And an awful lot of them have Uzis and AK-47s (assault rifles). 
It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
It was Gates' call for outlawing these kinds of assault rifles, registration of 
existing weapons, and his denunciation of the tactics of anti-abortionist 
protesters, that was blamed for eroding his natural base of support among 
conservatives in the 1988 exploratory campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"That took a lot of guts," City Councilman Nate Holden, one of the chief's 
strongest supporters, said of Gates' stand on assault rifles. "He said they 
were weapons of war and went up for legislation to ban those things. He didn't 
think about support from conservatives." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with so many waiting and watching for clues about his future, Gates seems 
to enjoy the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pretty (well) fixed in my mind what it would take to get me out of 
here, and some sense of when I will probably go," Gates said. "But no one will 
know when that is until I decide."

KENNETH BRANAGH'S 'GIFT OF CERTAINTY'; 
</P>
<P>
'HENRY V' ACTOR/DIRECTOR BRINGS HIS SINGULAR VISION TO MARK TAPER WITH 'LEAR,' 
'MIDSUMMER NIGHT' 
</P>

Kenneth Branagh seems to have brought all his luck on himself. By age 28 he had 
adapted, directed and starred in the critically acclaimed new film version of 
Shakespeare's "Henry V" and negotiated the first American appearance of his 
Renaissance Theatre Company in their new productions of "King Lear" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream," opening next Sunday at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Those accomplishments may look brash for his years but, when prodded, the 
Irish-English actor-director-playwright quite calmly catalogues the stepping 
stones of his own yellow brick road. His secret is what he has called his "gift 
of certainty," a knowledge of where that road might lead him. 
</P>
<P>
Branagh's teen-age years in Reading, England, where the only avenues out seemed 
to be British Rail, Prudential Insurance or the army, found him mesmerized by 
books, films and television and an unnamed desire for something other than "a 
normal job." A class play in high school unlocked the door to his future -- and 
London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to RADA," he says, "I was completely thrilled, and possessed, at 
the luxury to indulge my star-struck nature. It had suddenly appeared as a 
lifeline in a family that was completely unused to that kind of thing -- no 
theatrical background, no film background." 
</P>
<P>
While still at RADA he won prizes (most memorably for his Hamlet), jumped 
effortlessly into West End productions (Julian Mitchell's "Another Country") 
and television (D. H. Lawrence's "The Boy in the Bush," "The Fortunes of War"). 
He took over a small theater for a solo tour-de-force performance, and then 
played St. Francis in Mitchell's "Francis." 
</P>
<P>
He also spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company and had two of his 
own plays produced, most prominently "Public Enemy." Branagh describes it as "a 
piece about a long-term unemployed guy in Belfast who becomes obsessed with the 
movies of James Cagney and starts to borrow from them in his own life. It was 
partly about the political situation in Northern Ireland as perceived by the 
common person. And it was partly about the psychology of those people, what 
drives people to do that kind of thing. There's a certain kind of intensity 
about the Belfast situation, and also the power of the screen, of film, the 
influence of the media." 
</P>
<P>
There were also films, such as Simon Grey's "A Month in the Country" with Colin 
Firth, and "High Season," a delightfully offbeat comedy with Jacqueline Bisset. 
And there was the formation of his Renaissance Theatre Company, of which "Henry 
V" is the seventh production. It was a crowded half-dozen years that put an 
exclamation point on his "gift of certainty." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd trained 2 1/2 years at the Royal Academy, basically a classical acting 
training, if you like. But then I found that if you were offered work at all it 
was usually in film or television." 
</P>
<P>
Branagh is still boggled by his decision to concentrate on theater, 
particularly Shakespeare. "That may indicate a good instinct on my part, or 
utter foolhardiness, a kind of dourly old-fashioned nature. It was just part of 
my makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left RADA," he says, "and ever since, really, there's been a sort of 
guilt-stroke sense of responsibility. Here are people asking me to do these 
things. I must go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean being ruthlessly careerist. I think some people find me rather 
bland when they meet me, actors particularly, because I entered as an 
enthusiast and have remained an enthusiast. And that's what kept me going. 
Whenever I hit my head against a brick wall artistically, it almost makes me 
want to do something bolder next time around. The great thing is, it shocks me 
sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who has put themselves into that kind of exposed position will be 
aware of the fear factor. And so the continuing overcoming of the fear factor 
is an extraordinary thing. I don't know if there is really something that 
attracts me to those situations where you either have to sink or swim, where 
you have to call on real naked courage. But the thing that goes hand in hand 
with it, for me, all the time, is black, black despair. 
</P>
<P>
"Week five of the rehearsal process, I just sit in front of the telly on 
Sunday, weeping at the thought of having to do another week, and yet the next 
day going in and being very big. It's not a question of what people are going 
to think, it's what am I going to think? That's why I despair." 
</P>
<P>
Branagh's easy manner and winning way belie his "black" spells. And so do the 
results of his work, particularly with his own company. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very fascinated working with this company because they're a very 
strong company of actors. It's a young company. I'm thinking in terms of future 
work, marking out those film actors who do stage regularly, those who come from 
a theater background. There are also some very fine American film actors and 
actresses I would like to work with. I'm hoping with a foot in each camp -- 
movies and theater -- to try and create a climate in some wee way where people 
are not deemed to be eccentric or box-office death in movies if they have to do 
a play every couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning for theatrical ventures down the line," he continues, with his 
constant certainty, "and trying to keep the same kind of group of people 
together. And over here we'll be looking to meet some Americans to be part of 
that as well. Gordon (Davidson, the Taper's artistic director) and I are in 
deep discussion about the next stage, which will be an American stage, where we 
can start building the American ensemble he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Branagh leans back, smiling. "People have said to me, 'Why don't you do 
political theater?' Well, 'Henry V' is one of the most political plays ever 
written. The problem with Shakespeare is you can't tell his politics. There's a 
great subversive element in 'Henry V' which we chose to bring out, which is 
very contradictory and paradoxical. 
</P>
<P>
"People have made all sorts of claims for Shakespeare, haven't they? 
Shakespeare the Marxist, Shakespeare the Conservative, Shakespeare the Liberal 
Democrat. I think he's Shakespeare the Humanitarian, the Humanist, the 
realistic person of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of his plays, 'Henry V' in particular, are a political debate inside an 
adventure story. So you watch one and you'll get the other; things suggestive 
of other worlds, other experiences, touching deep emotions whilst appealing to 
you on a level which has absolutely to do with the here and now. And that's why 
some political theater is polemical and essentially non-dramatic, because it 
attempts to preach to converted folk, or it assaults people with a kind of 
bludgeoning approach." 
</P>
<P>
And the current repertory at the Taper? 
</P>
<P>
" 'Midsummer Night's Dream' is very political, if you like, about the 
relationships between men and women, which is about the most important subject 
still, hundreds of years on. It's a tremendously important subject. And the 
dream is very, very provocative and alive with all that. But political, no 
question. But also you will laugh a lot, and it's very moving. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think 'Lear' is most profoundly important and contemporary. 'Lear' is a 
tremendously potent political reflection of the age. There is a tremendous 
ruthlessness about Lear. We've tried to present a society which is ruthless and 
acquisitive, and every man for himself, survival of the fittest, very much the 
spirit of the age in England at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there are American parallels, but in England Mrs. Thatcher's 
reign is on the wane, I think. And it's not because she's ancient, but in terms 
of her political life. There are a lot of suggestions that she's not as sharp 
as she was. This is one of Lear's tragedies, that he wants to give everything 
up and still be king. And one of the things that happens once he gives it up, 
is instantly he's a kind of joke, a bit like Reagan. Instantly he's useless, 
completely redundant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendously invigorating experience but it's so real, an astonishing 
play. 'Lear' is like this extraordinary mountain hovering over you." 
</P>
<P>
That "mountain" and that "dream" will be making Branagh's political statements 
at the Taper, with his accustomed certainty that "I feel more prepared for 
these plays than I've felt about anything in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Branagh is prepared. And he's no longer 28. With a disarming smile that 
barely conceals the "full stop" seriousness behind, he admits proudly, "I've 
hit the big two-nine."
