THE CHALLENGE OF INTERDEPENDENCE REPORT OF THE BILATERAL COMMISSION ON THE 
FUTURE OF UNITED STATES-MEXICO RELATIONS (UNIVERSITY PRESS OF AMERICA: $19.95, 
CLOTH; $8.95, PAPER; 238 PP.)

By Abraham F. Lowenthal, Lowenthal, a professor of international relations at 
USC and executive director of the Washington-based organization Inter-American 
Dialogue, is author of Partners in Conflict: The United States and Latin 
America (Johns Hopkins University Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
No country affects the United States as much as Mexico. No other country is 
more pervasively influenced by the United States, in turn. Few bilateral 
relationships in the world are more complex, or more difficult to manage. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of persons engage in an intricate web of transactions between Mexico 
and the United States, most of them legal, but many not. U.S. corporations and 
banks have invested billions of dollars in Mexico; Mexicans have stashed 
billions in U.S. bank accounts and real estate; and Mexican workers in the 
United States send $2 billion a year to relatives at home. While thousands of 
Mexicans produce cars for the U.S. market, hundreds more take part in a massive 
trade in stolen vehicles. U.S. citizens cross into Mexico to obtain inexpensive 
medical care and legal medicines, but the trade in illegal narcotics is many 
times larger and more lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
The two governments deal with each other constantly on a host of issues -- 
clashing or cooperating on matters ranging from the price of gas to the size of 
tomatoes, trading rules to oil spills, ground water to sewage disposal. 
Domestic policy choices in each country -- on budgets, taxes, welfare, labor, 
education and immigration -- significantly affect its neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The intermestic (combining international and domestic) quality of U.S.-Mexico 
relations is nowhere more evident than in Southern California: the primary 
destination of Mexican immigrants and tourists, the main source of investments 
in Mexico's assembly (maquiladora) industries, the key beneficiary of Mexican 
flight capital, the largest market for illegal drugs from Mexico. 
Spanish-speaking students, most of them of Mexican origin, are a majority in 
the public schools of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
A "silent integration" is taking place on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico 
frontier. The economics, politics, and culture -- even the cuisine -- of the 
border region is becoming homogeneous, and different from the rest of the two 
countries. But while this interpenetration proceeds apace, conflicts between 
the two governments have also been multiplying. Bilateral tensions in the 1980s 
have been sharper than at any time since the 1920s. Frictions have intensified 
over immigration, drugs, debt, trade, investment and foreign policy 
differences, especially in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In "Limits to Friendship" two accomplished scholar-practitioners of U.S.-Mexico 
relations analyze why the relationship is so often frustrating and conflictive. 
Forty-one-year-old Robert A. Pastor, a Harvard-trained political scientist, was 
the Latin America specialist on the National Security Council during the Carter 
years; Jorge G. Castaneda, 35, the son of a former Mexican foreign minister, a 
graduate of Princeton and the University of Paris, is already Mexico's 
best-known commentator on international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Precociously well-established, the two self-confident, astute, and 
exceptionally articulate interlocutors are well-matched in this book. Writing 
alternate and reciprocal chapters, they vividly illustrate that Mexico and the 
United States are divided not only by vast asymmetries of power but also by a 
shared history each nation understands and remembers very differently. 
</P>
<P>
Each author personifies predominant national characteristics that are at the 
heart of the relationship. Pastor, an energetic problem-solver, argues that 
history need not be a barrier to U.S.-Mexico relations. He sees mutual 
advantage in closer economic relations and tells Mexicans that they have little 
to fear from foreign investment because, after all, foreign investment in the 
United States now accounts for a larger share of the U.S. economy than U.S. 
investment does in Mexico's. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda asserts that "Pastor's chapters underestimate the strength and 
currency of Mexican nationalism particularly in its anti-American bent." 
Castaneda twice expresses his concern about threats to Mexico's "national 
soul," a concept and phrase far from Pastor's discourse. 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda reveals a deeply felt distrust of the United States. He derides the 
U.S. tendency to push Mexico to do "for its own good" what the United States 
sees as in its best interest. He regards the maquiladora industries not as an 
outward-looking sector of the American economy, but as "an extension of the 
American economy on Mexican soil." He fears that privatization of the Mexican 
economy, forced by greater integration with the world economy, "may well turn 
out to be an Americanization." 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda's telling criticisms of Pastor's chapters effectively show why it is 
difficult to reconcile the Mexican and U.S. perspectives. But Castaneda is much 
less effective -- and thus perhaps most illuminating -- at conveying a coherent 
policy prescription of his own. Emotionally, he resists greater economic ties 
between Mexico and the United States, but analytically he appears to see them 
as inevitable. He notes that "ties between the two nations, while manageable, 
are not really improvable," -- but he joins Pastor in a final chapter of 
recommendations aimed precisely at improving these relations. Castaneda dances 
elegantly up to and around, but never quite addresses, the central question he 
himself poses: "Should Mexico resist integration? Or should it manage, govern, 
and administer that integration, with full awareness of its inevitability?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because Castaneda is unable to resolve his own ambivalence -- or 
because he reflects a fundamental national division of opinion -- the joint 
policy conclusions Pastor and Castaneda offer are not particularly original or 
exciting. By far the most arresting of their proposals is confined to two 
paragraphs and is not well-developed; almost as a throwaway line, they assert 
that "the moment is ripe to consider a package deal that would involve many 
concessions and demands by both nations in trade, energy, intelligence and 
security, debt, capital flight and immigration." But this bold and tantalizing 
suggestion is not further developed, and is undercut by much of Castaneda's 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Pastor and Castaneda sought primarily to illumine the differences 
between Mexico and the United States, the Bilateral Commission on the Future of 
United States-Mexican relations worked hard to overcome the differences. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report, "The Challenge of Interdependence," is an impressive 
product, given the familiar limits of consensual reports, as compounded by the 
particular difficulties of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. On most issues -- 
economics, migration, drugs, and education -- the commission was able to agree 
on a shared analysis, no small accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
As is common in commission reports, many of the recommendations are calls for 
yet more study -- and some of the prose is ponderously prudent and balanced to 
a fault. But the report is surprisingly forthright in recommending that 
Mexico's debt-service obligations be limited to levels consistent with the 
country's growth; in proposing a two-step approach toward expanded free trade; 
in urging Mexico to adopt a more open and consistent policy to attract foreign 
investment; and in favoring a bilateral accord on migration that would both 
increase the legal Mexican migration to the United States and provide a 
long-term temporary workers program. 
</P>
<P>
"The Challenge of Interdependence," the first such effort by U.S. and Mexican 
nongovernmental leaders to seek joint responses to shared problems, suggests by 
its very existence that a corner is being turned in relations between the two 
countries. U.S. Because U.S.-Mexico relations are in such great flux, neither 
"Limits to Friendship" nor "The Challenge of Interdependence" is likely to be 
the last word on this topic. The two books, however, represent a major advance 
over anything written before. No one interested in our most challenging 
international tie should be without either volume.

GROWING UP POLITICAL IN CHICAGO; 
</P>
<P>
FIREBIRD BY JAMES CARROLL (E.P. DUTTON: $18.95; 439 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Any bookstore worth its bindings will have a big window display of James 
Carroll's "Firebird" in place in time for the presidential inauguration. If 
winter weather isn't enough to set you shivering, this political thriller will 
cause a frisson to run up even the most patriotic spine. What's the last thing 
you want to hear as the ex-director of the CIA takes the helm of a kinder, 
gentler ship of state? That the boys who run the intelligence community are -- 
holy red telephone! -- mere mortals who are capable of trading away their 
countrymen's very lives to carry out a personal vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who has dealt with the dilemmas of integrity and patriotism before, 
notably in "Prince of Peace" (1985) and "Supply of Heroes" (1986), cushions 
this revelatory blow a bit by setting his story back in the post-World War II 
FBI, but that's thin comfort, given what he has to say. His hero, Chris Malone, 
is a boyish idealist cut from the same Midwestern mold as last season's 
cinematic Eliot Ness: A dreamy Irish kid who grows up near the Chicago 
stockyards and yearns for a job with the FBI, far from his drunken locksmith of 
a father. He wants an upstanding, imposing dad like J. Edgar Hoover; if he 
can't have one at home, going to work for one is the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
Malone is just another anonymous Kansas City agent when the call comes from 
Washington: The Russians have managed to get hold of American atomic bomb 
secrets, and the FBI has to find out how. Webb Minot, one of Hoover's top men, 
wants Malone to break into the safe at the Russian embassy and copy the 
contents of a code book that will enable the Bureau to translate crucial coded 
messages and find the spy. Minot has concocted a phony identity for Malone as 
one Peter Ward, a low-level Foreign Service officer who comes completely 
equipped with an exotic, mysterious Russian wife named Anna. All Malone has to 
do is pretend to be Peter Ward long enough to steal the goods, and he's a big 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
Or so he thinks. The real intrigue, of course, starts after he gets the code 
book -- or rather, when he enters the code room at the embassy and discovers 
that someone has made his job a bit too easy. From that moment on, Carroll's 
novel is a juggernaut of cynicism and amorality, driven by men who exhibit the 
kind of steely, inhuman resolve that can so easily be mistaken for 
selflessness. It wouldn't be fair to give away the final unraveling of the 
Firebird plan -- but it suggests that even men of supposed good will, men 
entrusted with our national security, fall prey to a peculiarly dangerous 
paradox. Although they are no different, no better, than anyone else, they have 
a distressing tendency to think that they can play God. 
</P>
<P>
To stick with "Firebird," you have to be one of those people who are fascinated 
by the machinations of evil bureaucrats. Carroll comes up with an exhausting 
supply of dead ends, false leads, double and triple crosses, and outright lies 
for his hero to untangle. For, lest we dismiss his tale as paranoia without 
purpose, the author reminds us that this is a coming-of-age story, as much as 
it is a political thriller. Malone has to work his way through the maze -- as 
he all too frequently reminds us -- to discover, not just the truth about the 
FBI, but the truth about himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has a heavy hand when it comes to the psychological aspects of his 
story; maybe he's worried that the reader, head reeling from the 
Russian-American-British intrigues, will miss the sub-text. He sets up Malone's 
early affection for Minot well enough, but then feels compelled to relate every 
incremental slippage of that affection as Malone moves, inexorably, toward 
enlightenment. The pace gets sludgy, and what is meant as an emotional signpost 
begins to seem like a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
And the enigmatic Anna is the definitive literary onion: Malone keeps peeling 
and peeling, but there's always more to find out, always one more layer to her 
complex tale. Luckily, Anna has one attribute that Beth, the wan little 
sweetheart that Malone left behind, didn't seem to possess: Anna is a knockout. 
Whenever Malone's energy starts to lag, he and Anna have a rousing sexual 
encounter, and somehow he finds the strength to go on. 
</P>
<P>
The pay-off is nicely complex, if dated. If this were a movie (and the 
specificity of some of the locations does seem like a hopeful hint to any 
producers who might pick up the book), the audience would likely cheer the 
hero's epiphany. The only question is: Would they get as far as the parking lot 
before they started to worry about who runs the show after the honorable 
fellows have packed their bags? Good thing "Firebird" is fiction.

GROWING UP POLITICAL IN CHICAGO; 
</P>
<P>
JACK GANCE BY WARD JUST (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $17.95; 279 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Dretzka, Dretzka is TV/radio editor at the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit Ward Just with good timing. The publication of this stimulating tale of 
our two most politically obsessed cities happens to coincide with a wild 
mayoral primary in Chicago and a transfer of power in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Examining the education of a young man in the science of politics and his 
evolution from idealist to realist, the novel moves briskly from Gance's early 
successes "in the shadows" of the Machine to the nation's capital. There, he 
employs skills learned in the wards to become a "Mr. Fix-It" with a White House 
address. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years in the District, he returns to Illinois to put what's left of 
his political and ethical resolve to the ultimate test. 
</P>
<P>
In the political trenches, the first and last lesson taught is loyalty -- the 
rewards and drawbacks of which are the cornerstone of this novel. Jack Gance's 
father, a businessman and fringe player in Chicago politics, didn't pay the 
piper, and his independence landed him in jail; his son took a different path 
and fared better, but at no small cost to himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
A Midwesterner and journalist in Vietnam and Washington before turning to 
fiction, the 53-year-old Just writes with an economy and eye for detail rare 
among today's novelists. "Jack Gance" covers 40 years of complex family history 
and political trends, yet no words are wasted and -- at a mere 279 pages -- it 
is a rich and entertaining journey. 
</P>
<P>
Through his protagonist, Just's ideas are rendered in low-calorie bursts of 
prose that demonstrate a clarity of vision and a unique insight into human 
nature. This, for example, is Gance's view of his future, as seen from the 
University of Chicago in 1959: 
</P>
<P>
"My last year at the university I discovered the world outside, and it was not 
as dangerous as I had feared. The world was approachable after a fashion, badly 
needing reform and reconstruction. I buried myself in work, American elections, 
a man's work in a man's world: politics." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is this succinct definition of the profession -- one I wish my 
professors had offered, instead of four months of pontifications: "Assemble 
coalitions, marry one region to another, cut and splice the map, rewire the 
circuits; that was politics." Boom. 
</P>
<P>
"Reform and reconstruction" were impossibly idealistic concepts in the Windy 
City throughout most of the Daley regime. As the buffoonish alderman Paddy 
Bauler boasted in 1955, "Chicago ain't ready for reform yet." Wasn't then, 
probably isn't now -- still, the pursuit of such goals makes for a good story. 
</P>
<P>
Gance uses polling theories developed at the university -- and new to the party 
hacks -- to steer the course for John F. Kennedy's success in Illinois in 1960. 
In doing so, Gance impresses "the Boss" and the boys "downtown," but nearly 
blows his fledgling career when he has an affair with the wife of a politically 
connected lawyer ("the kind of law where you don't have to open a law book, or 
even own one"). 
</P>
<P>
Gance eventually is pushed out of the nest and lands in Washington, where he 
makes his reputation as an "inside man." After experiencing "burnout," he moves 
on to consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
When he decides to run for Senate, Gance must wrestle with the question of 
rejoining the Machine to ensure victory or going "independent," as did his 
father, and likely losing. Just frames this inner conflict in a fascinating 
way, focusing the entire debate on a golf match with a wily old political 
fixer. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the philosophies and transactions in "Jack Gance" are reminiscent of 
those attributed to the Mafia in various books and movies, especially those 
situations involving questions of loyalty: "This is a valuable lesson . . . 
that (a person) must stand up, that when a deal's done it can't be undone and 
that when you give your word you keep it." Sounds like Vito Corleone, but the 
voice belongs to a respected Chicago attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, years after both have left Chicago, Gance's embittered father unfairly 
accuses his son of deserting him and going to work "for the Mob" and the money. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, it's hard to know what to make of Gance's decisions and 
compromises, but this ambivalence rings true with our increasingly cynical view 
of politics and politicians. Mostly, we are grateful to have been left alone 
with an insider, an eyewitness, and have learned something -- however ugly -- 
about the motivations of politicians and the seductive nature of power. 
</P>
<P>
Just makes politics a substantially more colorful calling than it actually is 
-- certainly as evidenced by the drab 1988 presidential campaign -- and the 
people represented here wouldn't be as interesting if drawn by a lesser writer. 
His contribution to our understanding of the political game in this and other 
novels is enormous, and he deserves a broad and enthusiastic readership.

<TEXT>
<P>
Unconquered (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie based on the story of 
Richmond Flowers Jr., an Alabama youth who overcomes asthma and bigotry to 
become a world-class athlete. Dermot Mulroney, Peter Coyote and Tess Harper 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Keaton stars in Ron Howard's amusing but overly stereotypical 1986 
comedy Gung Ho (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), playing a Pennsylvania plant foreman who 
persuades a Japanese conglomerate to buy the bankrupt local auto company only 
to find that he and his pals have a hard time hewing to no-nonsense Japanese 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schwarzenegger manages not to take himself too seriously, but that's 
about the only redeeming virtue of the ultra-violent, ultra-complicated 1986 
Raw Deal (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), which features Schwarzenegger as the least 
conspicuous sheriff in all rural North Carolina, recruited by FBI veteran 
Darren McGavin to infiltrate Chicago Mafia lord Sam Wanamaker's inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
9 1/2 Weeks (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again Saturday at 8 p.m.), based on a 
woman's pseudonymous account of a masochistic love affair, became a swooningly 
silly cautionary tale about the bad (Mickey Rourke) and the beautiful (Kim 
Basinger), a pair whose sexual tastes might have surfaced after a night of 
watching Bo Derek's "Bolero" on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 film of The Little Drummer Girl (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m. and 
Saturday at 10 p.m.) squeezed the life out of the John le Carre novel -- a work 
of much psychological complexity, richness and subtlety -- leaving only the 
most mechanical kind of suspense. Diane Keaton is game but thrashes about in a 
one-dimensional part as an actress recruited by Israelis to snare a Palestinian 
terrorist leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Cover Girl and the Cop (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie, a comedy 
about a beautiful actress/model (Julia Duffy) and a tough policewoman (Dinah 
Manoff) forced to live and work together when they are pursued by killers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryan White Story (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is another new fact-based TV movie 
in which Lukas Haas stars as a youth barred from school because he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a dynamic, ambitious World War II 
musical fantasy-romance from Australia that overreaches yet leaves us better 
nourished than the usual run-of-the-mill movie. In essence the 1986 film is a 
backstage musical in which the brassy, gutsy star (Debbie Byrne) of a Sydney 
nightclub revue becomes involved with a troubled young American Marine (Matt 
Dillon). 
</P>
<P>
Still another new TV movie based on actual events, Desperate for Love (CBS 
Tuesday at 9 p.m.) stars Christian Slater and Brian Bloom as Georgia teen-agers 
whose attraction to the same girl (Veronica Cartwright) has tragic 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The Adventures of Mark Twain (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), made in 1985, is 
of more interest for its claymation techniques than as a Twain pastiche 
exploring the darker side of his personality. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 Body Heat (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is an amusing 
and very steamy contemporary variation on "Double Indemnity" with William Hurt 
and Kathleen Turner in the Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck roles. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Carpenter made a nifty 1978 TV movie debut with Someone's 
Watching Me! (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), which stars Lauren Hutton as a 
career woman who can't convince the cops that somebody is stalking her. 
</P>
<P>
Husbands (Channel 28 Friday at 10:30 p.m.), John Cassavetes' powerful comment 
on the failure of American men to grow up, stars Ben Gazzara (never better), 
Peter Falk and Cassavetes himself as three suburban New York family men on a 
binge in the wake of the death of one of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
The Defiant Ones (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a so-so remake of the 1958 
classic, with Robert Urich and Carl Weathers in the roles created so memorably 
by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log 
listings service.

What follows on the next several pages of Calendar is Hollywood at its best -- 
and worst. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 450 titles compiled here (down about 100 from last year's 
listing, due to a drop in film production) some may be critical darlings and 
some may be blockbusters. Most will be stinkers. 
</P>
<P>
But we as filmgoers hope there will be enough in this compendium of productions 
that will be worth the price of our time and money. Or, at the very least, the 
cost of a video rental. 
</P>
<P>
As you read, you might find yourself thinking that you've read this plot 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Be forewarned: Certain words -- like murder, revenge and kidnaping -- pop up 
with regularity. And not just in movies with no-name casts, made by small, 
no-name companies; the studios also are promising story lines having to do with 
murder, revenge and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The story lines often are replete with webs to entrap heroes. We discovered all 
kinds of them as we sorted through publicist-supplied plot lines. There were 
webs of intrigue, webs of deceit, webs of horror. And even webs of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Along with sound-alike plots, some of the movies may have titles that you swear 
you've heard before. You have. 
</P>
<P>
(In the case of "Lawrence of Arabia," it will soon have a special reissue -- 25 
years later -- with never-before seen footage.) 
</P>
<P>
A number of our titles are returnees from last year and a smattering are making 
their third appearance on our annual listing. They were produced and have since 
been languishing, sometimes due to a web of red tape involving 
distribution-ownership woes. Some never got made. As we were told solemnly by 
the rep for one small production company (with a single, low-budget film for 
our list), "We'd like to think that we are going to release the film, but 
there's no guarantee. Look at 'Heaven's Gate' . . . You just never know if a 
film is going to be released until you screen it and see what you have." 
</P>
<P>
As with each year's compilation, we went through our own adventures. 
</P>
<P>
All Universal Studios would say about a Steven Spielberg-directed project was 
that it was . . . "An Untitled Love Story Directed by Steven Spielberg." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't he supposedly going to film "Always," a love story based on the '40s 
Spencer Tracy film, "A Guy Named Joe"? A call to Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment brought a response in the affirmative. But, we were told, 
unaccountably, the project should not be identified as "Always"/"A Guy Named 
Joe." 
</P>
<P>
The studio also wouldn't tell us the plot to a planned Jetsons movie -- which 
is based on the animated TV series! 
</P>
<P>
One super-budgeted, super-star, super-silly fantasy sent a single photo that 
was so dark, one of the stars faded into the background. 
</P>
<P>
One company, producing another sequel, sent pictures from its last sequel. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the super-secretive productions that didn't want to send any 
photos. In the beginning, the folks at Warner Bros. were so nervous over their 
big-bat-budget "Batman" -- especially in regard to the controversial casting of 
Michael Keaton as the Batguy -- that we weren't going to get any art. Then came 
a possibility that we might get shots of Keaton as Bruce Wayne, alter ego of 
the Caped Crusader. Finally, at the last minute, in flew a picture of Keaton in 
Batgarb. (See our cover.) 
</P>
<P>
For our annual advisory, note that the listings are all subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
That includes stars, film makers, titles and plots. Some movies' scripts have 
yet to be written. 
</P>
<P>
Release dates, especially, could vary widely. Distributors are always looking 
to achieve the best effect. 
</P>
<P>
The wherever and whenever can vary. As one small distributor told us, "Our 
movie may play somewhere like Georgia, then go to video. It depends." 
</P>

 Christine Ziaya assisted in compiling the films.

IMPERFECTIONS 
</P>
<P>
OK, there were a few gaffes in our Sneaks '89. It is Edward S. Feldman -- not 
Ed Pressman -- who is producing "Wired" with Charles Meeker. The Francis Ford 
Coppola-directed segment of "New York Stories" stars newcomer Heather McComb, 
not Coppola's daughter, Sofia. Sofia co-wrote the script with her father and 
also designed the costumes and titles. Merrin Holt and Ken Krauss are the 
writers of the comedy "Buy and Cell," not director Robert Boris. And the 
vampire picture "To Die For" -- which we labeled "distributor pending" -- will 
be distributed by Skouras Pictures in March.

IMPERFECTIONS

The actress in mouse makeup for "The Witches" was incorrectly identified as 
Anjelica Huston in Jan. 15's "Sneaks '89" roundup. The rodent's true identity 
was not available at press time.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: NOT-SO-VITAL STATISTICS; 
</P>
<P>
COULD IT BE TRUE THAT FIVE YEARS OF OUR LIVES ARE SPENT WAITING IN LINE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I TEND TO BE depressed by statistics. They reflect such flaws in our society: 
33% of us are illiterate; the average person spends six hours a day watching 
television; half of all marriages end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Our appetite for statistics is bottomless; though many are not even attributed, 
we never seem to question them. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, for example, my wife showed me a piece in Family Circle magazine 
about the amount of time we spend on various activities. The figures were 
fascinating, but I finally decided I couldn't believe them. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it stated that in one lifetime the average American spends eight 
months opening junk mail. I doubt that. I don't think anyone opens more junk 
mail than I do. Actually, my wife opens it; I just throw it away. So at the 
most I spend only an hour a week on junk mail. I have been receiving junk mail 
in large quantities for only the last 20 years. An hour a week for 20 years is 
only 1,040 hours. There are only 720 hours in most months. So, I have spent 
about a month and a half opening junk mail. That's bad enough. 
</P>
<P>
The article also says that we spend six years of our lives consuming food and 
drink and five years waiting in lines; housework takes another four years. 
</P>
<P>
Since the time spent consuming food and drink must be considered leisure time, 
we need not be concerned with that total. However, I cannot believe that the 
average homemaker spends more time waiting in line than doing housework. 
</P>
<P>
How often does the average homemaker go to the supermarket to buy groceries? 
Three times a week? How long does he or she wait in line each time? Probably 
not more than 20 minutes -- though it may seem longer. That's about one hour a 
week. They probably will spend 10 minutes waiting in line at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
How much time, on the other hand, does that same person spend at housework? At 
least 20 minutes a day doing the dishes alone. Plus an hour a day picking up, 
dusting, scrubbing, cleaning, arranging, mending. 
</P>
<P>
If housewives spend less time doing housework than standing in line, then there 
is not much weight to their argument that in the domestic equation they carry 
the greater burden. Of course, most housewives have to do not only the 
housework, but also stand in line. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of all these time-consuming activities, the article states, married 
couples converse only four minutes a day, and working parents spend a fleeting 
30 seconds on daily chats with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
The report (prepared by Priority Management Pittsburgh) doesn't even mention 
the time we spend watching television, which is probably close to six hours a 
day or one-fourth of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider television, it might seem possible that married couples 
converse only four minutes a day. But on the contrary, it's when we're watching 
television that my wife and I converse the most. We are always commenting to 
one another about the movies, complaining about the implausibilities, lauding a 
bit of dialogue, arguing about whether we've seen the movie before. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there's a time that we're closer than when we're watching 
television. Television has saved our marriage. 
</P>
<P>
As for the time parents spend talking with their children, I hate to think that 
the report is true. I admit that parents and children don't seem to have a lot 
in common, and there isn't much real conversation. It's often limited to "Eat 
your breakfast," or "Put on your coat" or "Be home by 12 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
However, the daily arguments alone between parents and children must consume 
more than 30 seconds. And even an argument counts as conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The article states that we spend seven years in the bathroom. That's the only 
one I don't question. Anyone who has ever lived in a house with two teen-age 
children and only one bathroom knows that he has spent seven years of his life 
just waiting to get into the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The article didn't say how many years we spend on sex. However many years it 
has taken out of my life, I can't say I regret it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lot better than standing in line at the bank.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE AMERICAN WOMAN, 1988-89 A STATUS REPORT EDITED BY SARA 
E. RIX (W.W. NORTON: $19.95)

Like the editor's "status report" last year, this book is largely a gloomy 
survey of persistent inequities between the sexes: Women's median income for 
full-time work, for instance, is still only 68% of men's. It is punctuated by 
colorful notes about progress made in the last decade, however, not only in law 
and medicine but in agriculture (once "invisible farmers," women are now 
acknowledged linchpins of the rural community), religion (80% of Protestant 
denominations in America now ordain women) and politics (the number of states 
with incumbent female lieutenant governors went from 0 in 1970 to 15 in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
Also like last year's volume, unfortunately, "The American Woman" lacks a 
clearly defined readership. This book doesn't quite work as a journalistic 
overview for a general readership, for there are no colorful, first-person 
interviews to compel our attention. Nor is there serious analysis of 
institutional problems to help activists and policy makers build movements for 
change. A chapter on women in religion, for instance, argues that spiritual 
freedom won't be complete until Catholic women can become clergy members, but 
doesn't survey various church leaders to get a sense of how long women will 
have to wait for equality and what they can do to hasten its arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "The American Woman" is a remarkably clear and concise reference 
tool, one that will certainly be of use to at least one group: activists who 
wish to counter the widespread myth that America has overcome the 
discrimination that afflicted society before the Sexual Revolution.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HONG KONG BY JAN MORRIS (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the far corners of the globe have become accessible even to 
middle-class Americans, travel writing, once concerned with evoking the color, 
character and spirit of places few would ever see, has often come to do little 
more than list hotels and restaurants. Jan Morris is one travel writer, 
however, whose work maintains the vividness and evocativeness of the old 
tradition. In this ambitious, detailed portrait, she sees in the British 
territory, scheduled to be returned to China in 1997, "an astounding epilogue 
to the (British) Empire." 
</P>
<P>
Morris is acutely sensitive to the poetry of place, and her particular strength 
here lies in capturing the city's aesthetic balances, its cultural yins and 
yangs. She visits "louche and lascivious" night spots, for instance, where neon 
ads cast streets "into a gaudy glow, like a nightmare disco," but notes that 
these are also "festive places (where) a general sense of having a good time is 
shared by all races, at all levels of wealth and poverty." 
</P>
<P>
The city's most significant dualism, however, is between capitalism and 
communism. While Chinese industrialists fled into Hong Kong after the 1949 
Communist Revolution, today something of the reverse is true. Morris reports 
that many Hong Kong industrialists are now returning to China at the invitation 
of the Communists, who have organized semi-capitalist "Special Economic Zones," 
such as Shenzhen. Shenzhen is "like an extension of Hong Kong," Morris writes, 
"very nearly a suburb, as though it is the colony that is taking over the 
republic, rather than the other way round." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is the key question: Will the Communists grant Hong Kong some 
autonomy of its own in 1997? Morris hopes so, for she is saddened by the 
possibility that Hong Kong, which has just produced its first well-educated 
middle class, might be deadened of purpose and dissipated of identity when 
Britain leaves. Morris' regret stems partly from her idealization of the city; 
she largely glosses over the city's persistent problems, from police corruption 
to gang warfare, not mentioning, for instance, the serious problems caused by 
mass arrivals of boat people early last year. But Morris' regret also reveals 
her sincere devotion to the place, an intimate attachment that makes this book 
all the more compelling.

I love the way ABC treats our Olympic champ. The network advertises the 
daylights out of "Brian Boitano: Canvas of Ice," then shows it at 10:45 p.m. on 
the West Coast! Who cares about watching Sarah Purcell interviewing Mary Tyler 
Moore (in the preceding "Public People, Private Lives")? ABC could have aired 
Boitano's special on another night other than Monday so the football game 
wouldn't have interfered with it. Good going, ABC!

'THEY LIKE US, THEY REALLY LIKE US'; 
</P>
<P>
NOW NEW YORK ALSO LOOKS WEST FOR INSPIRATION IN FOOD AND FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By , Nina Easton is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANNIE Flanders is breathless, positively breathless, over L.A. "It's the most 
exciting city," she gushes. "I look forward to eating there. The clubs are 
great. The shopping is great. There's an energy we don't have. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the hotels. We went out there with Cyndi Lauper, and we stayed at the 
Sunset Marquis. It was wonderful. We shopped until we dropped. We went to 
Melrose, we bought out half the store at Repeat Performance. It's great, the 
shopping, the weather. Everyone I talk to now, even people determined to 
despise it, can't anymore. The energetic, creative people -- they're there, 
doing wonderful things. There's so much happening. And it's so easy to live 
there." 
</P>
<P>
You won't hear many New Yorkers going gaga over La-La like that. But the very 
fact that this kind of talk is coming from one of Manhattan's leading arbiters 
of hip -- Flanders edits "Details," a magazine for the nightclub set -- is a 
sign that New Yorkers are taking new stock of the city they once wrote off as 
Disneyland for adults. "People here are very attuned to what L.A. can offer 
them," says Tom Julian, associate fashion director of the Men's Fashion Assn. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
This new respect -- and fascination with -- Los Angeles is reflected in the 
pages of New York-based publications such as GQ and New York Woman, which have 
started offering regular L.A.-watch columns. Flanders' Details is readying its 
second full issue about the city (the first one included an extensive guide to 
Melrose Avenue), as is Avenue, a New York magazine for the staid upscale set. 
The October issue of HG devoted a 33-page section to "Living in L.A.," and 
Metropolitan Home plans to publish its first special L.A. issue in August. Spy 
magazine, the nemesis of Manhattan institutions, has decided that L.A.'s sacred 
cows are nearly as entertaining to milk -- it has published a special issue and 
runs a regular column. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that New Yorkers have taken notice of L.A.'s new museums and 
burgeoning theater movement, overall, Manhattan appears to be quite content 
with its own arts culture. What seems to interest New Yorkers most about L.A. 
is the city's ambiance: Its food and fashion and life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it visually invigorating to drive around L.A.," says Joan Kron, editor 
of Avenue magazine. Adds Dorothy Kalins, editor of Metropolitan Home magazine: 
"There are so many cultural signals coming from L.A. that are changing ways of 
socializing, of living at home." 
</P>
<P>
Architecture is a case in point. Increasingly, L.A. architects -- such as Frank 
Gehry and his disciples -- are building national reputations, not in 
skyscrapers but in homes and restaurants. "I would say that of the top 10 young 
architects, a disproportionate number are in Los Angeles," Kalins says. She 
adds that these architects are characterized by their "individual 
conceptualization of every project. They have no rigid framework or formula. . 
. . They are terribly inventive." 
</P>
<P>
California cuisine, which also threw out the traditional rule book, has an even 
stronger influence in New York. "Ten years ago, New Yorkers, tired of heavy 
French food, were being told they should eat more healthfully," says restaurant 
consultant Clark Wolf. "Suddenly here were these people from L.A. with baskets 
of fresh vegetables and boxes of mesquite." 
</P>
<P>
And strange concoctions like lobster and potato chip salad and roasted red 
pepper pancakes with sweet corn sauce and caviar. "It was pretty 
controversial," recalls chef Jonathan Waxman, who moved his California cuisine 
to New York five years ago. But it was also popular: In short order, Waxman's 
restaurant, Jam's, became the place to go, and Waxman himself became the city's 
newest superchef. Waxman closed the restaurant after a partnership split and 
opened up his own, less pricey, restaurant -- called simply Jonathan Waxman's 
-- last spring. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s Wolfgang Puck gained such prominence with New Yorkers that when 
Manhattan restaurants couldn't lure him East, they started hiring away his 
chefs and opening Spago clones. 
</P>
<P>
It may be old hat by now to visit California-style restaurants such as Waxman's 
or Melrose, the West Hollywood-style cafe run by former Spago chef Richard 
Krause, or Big Kahuna, with its surfer decor. But the influence of California 
cuisine goes beyond these specialty restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Mesquite grills, fresh herbs and vegetables and ingredients such as cilantro 
are now common fare at New York restaurants. "California cuisine is now part of 
the fabric of New York eating," says Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, L.A.'s fashion world is gaining respect, and influence, on the 
East Coast. Department stores are carrying more and more clothing lines by 
California designers. In April, Bloomingdale's will launch a two-month-long 
celebration of California, complete with a kickoff dinner created by Puck. The 
Men's Fashion Assn. held one of its national press shows here for the first 
time last year and plans a second one this month. "It has changed so 
dramatically over the past two years," the association's Julian says of the 
city's fashion business. 
</P>
<P>
Young women showed up on Melrose Avenue wearing black stretch biking shorts, 
black blazers and pumps; it didn't take long, Julian says, for that style to 
become the rage in New York. More lasting influences can also be found: Dressy 
sportswear with a soft construction and fabrics such as washed silk can be 
traced to L.A., Julian says. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s influence over East Coast fashion is centralized at the lower end of the 
price spectrum: racks of colorful jams, fluorescent and black neoprene surfwear 
by Body Glove and pastel T-shirts that are popular in stores throughout New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"Body Glove is getting more and more popular," says Kalman Ruttenstein, senior 
vice president/fashion direction at Bloomingdale's. "I saw a lot of it last 
summer in the shops on Martha's Vineyard." But you don't need to go to the 
ruling class's favorite vacation spot to see the influence of L.A. style: A 
group of inner-city Brooklyn high school basketball players, featured recently 
on "60 Minutes," was wearing -- guess what? Not gym shorts, but jams.

ENDPAPERS: THE WOMAN WHO WROTE SIX FIRST NOVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS PHILIPSON, Philipson, a novelist, moonlights for the Customs 
Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps these notes ought to be called a public service announcement for career 
counseling. What they reveal comes out of a job-related experience. As a 
passport control officer at a major American city where international flights 
arrive and every incoming passenger must be cleared through customs, I have 
occasion, day in and day out, to look at the way people describe themselves on 
the line in their passports where they're asked to supply their "occupation." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of answers are what you would conventionally expect: Women declare 
themselves housewives and something else like gourmet cooks or fashion 
specialists or interior decorators; men name some profession or technical 
competence that confirms their place in the hierarchy of earning powers in our 
social Establishment. But, now and then, there are surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Writers make up a peculiarly interesting group. Some call themselves 
"creative," others "free-lance" -- I suppose depending on their godly or 
devilish associations. Those who identify with more specific powers enlist as 
novelists, playwrights, short story writers, essayists or film writers. But I 
think I've seen everything now that a woman appeared just the other day who 
handed me her passport where I read, as her occupation, the phrase "first 
novelist." 
</P>
<P>
I asked: "Does that mean you've just written your first novel?" I must have 
said it with a strong sense of surprise because, given nearly professionally 
radiant makeup and a truly handsome wardrobe, she appeared to be a creature 
somewhere between the ages of 30 and 50; anywhere between 30 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," she replied. "I've written a number of first novels." She said it 
with unconcealed satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"What number?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Six. I've written six first novels during the past 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
"Forgive me, madame, but how is that possible? You sound like a mother who's 
telling me she's had six first babies. You can't have a first child except the 
first time you give birth to a baby." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's say that is a semantical point. It depends on what you mean by 
you. When you are known by a particular name and you use that same name on one 
novel after another, then, no, you are right. You can't have written six first 
novels. But if you change your name for each novel that you produce, so that 
you seem to be a person who has never written any other novel before, that you 
is able to write a first novel each time she has a novel published -- as I do." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that like misrepresentation? Doing business under illegal conditions? 
Doesn't it get you into trouble with the Internal Revenue Service every income 
tax time?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, no." She was comfortable about her role. "It's perfectly legal, just 
like a large corporation taking out a different trademark for each different 
product that it creates and manufactures. It doesn't matter by now if Philip 
Morris cigarettes is responsible for Kraft Cheese, or is it Kraft Cheese that 
is responsible for Marlboro cigarettes? Those various goods are considered 
strictly on their own merits, each by itself, and in no way benefit from or are 
undermined by association with other products from the same owner." 
</P>
<P>
"But literary artists don't like to think of their writings as comparable to 
what a Campbell's Soup Co. might put out, do they? Don't they take pride in a 
whole career rather than just one of their books now and then?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's the way it used to be. There was a time -- it lasted for about 
200 years, and ended about 20 years ago -- when there were publishers who 
brought out whatever an author would write whether it was poems, stories, 
plays, essays, or novels. Such a person was a man of letters and such a 
publisher published whatever he wrote, as it was his intention to bring out his 
collected works, his oeuvre, the body of an entire writing career: For such a 
writer was thought of as an author, an authority, a genuine creative artist. 
Moreover, there were readers who wanted to read whatever such a genuine author 
created. 
</P>
<P>
"But those days are long since past. At least 20 years past. There is no 
concealing the fact that in the Western world today writing is divided the way 
the food we eat is divided, between gourmet literature and junk literature. But 
for both kinds no author is authority enough for a publisher to take a gamble 
on anything -- that is to say everything -- that he or she writes. Therefore 
each thing (story, play, novel, essay) is judged by itself on the basis of 
whether it will be a 'hit' on its own or not." 
</P>
<P>
"But then how can a writer make a name for himself?" 
</P>
<P>
"Neither he nor she can, anymore. We're conditioned so our maximum attention 
span can accommodate one TV commercial every few minutes. I guess the future of 
literature lies in the aphorism. In any case, neither the publisher nor the 
audience -- the book-buying public -- has the attention span to finish a whole 
novel let alone follow a whole career." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that why writers keep changing publishers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. And that's why I keep changing names. And it's why there are no Men -- or 
Women -- of Letters anymore. The age of specialization is upon us. No one, it 
is believed, can be good at more than one thing. If you're a poet, then you 
can't expect your publisher to bring out your stories or articles. If you're a 
novelist, you can't expect anyone to produce or broadcast or license your 
plays. There are no more Voltaires, no more Victor Hugos. There are no more 
giants. Neither publisher nor reader will invest in a person, an artist, a 
creator in the sense of becoming a devoted follower, a supporter, sponsor of a 
whole career." 
</P>
<P>
"A devotee." 
</P>
<P>
"Correct: Devotion is passe, And yet, amazingly, there survives a tiny remnant, 
a vestigial mini-audience who believes that ingenious, original, creative 
literary art might be a godsend, a revelation, something in the way of a truth 
that will set ye free -- therefore, a particularly generous, a uniquely kindly, 
courteous reading -- reviewing -- and buying of First Novels takes place. So 
I've plugged into that. I write only first novels." 
</P>
<P>
"But as a different person each time. No one will ever look for the shape of 
your literary career as a whole," I said, sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the price I have to pay," she replied. In a world where no one reads 
enough to discover the pattern in the carpet, how can one dream to be read 
enough for anyone to find the shape in the career? No. It's enough to get 
published at all, each time under a new name, by a different publisher." 
</P>
<P>
"As if 'the first time' might yield the only new information." 
</P>
<P>
"All readers have become Don Juans lusting only for virgins. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"And all writers engaged in the hope of a new life within each new literary 
beginning. We don't really feel satisfied with the thought of making money the 
old fashioned way, slowly over some period of time -- earning it; what we want 
is magic -- making fame and fortune by one stroke of the wand." 
</P>
<P>
We had held up the line of travelers long enough. The other arriving passengers 
were becoming restless. I cleared the lady's passport and sent her on through 
customs. I went back to checking passports remembering quietly to myself that I 
too am a writer of sorts, trying, experimenting, between busy-work hours here 
at the Customs House. During those times, when I make things up, I, too, can 
think of myself as an Imaginative Writer. My day will come -- I hope. In the 
meanwhile: Call me Ishmael.

PRIVATE LIVES: MONEY, HONEY; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A TOUCHIER SUBJECT THAN SEX. IT'S THE ROOT OF ALL MARITAL CONFLICT. IT'S 
MODERN FINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGO KAUFMAN, Margo Kaufman is a contributing editor of this magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"WE NEED TO TALK about money," says my husband. I clench my fists and begin to 
hyperventilate. Duke and I have a modern attitude about finances: We don't 
trust each other. Does anyone? 
</P>
<P>
"Are you free Monday night?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fight Monday night," I reply. "I'm on deadline." The last thing I need 
to think about is how much we spent on Christmas and how much we're going to 
have to spend on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to balance our checkbook and pay some bills," he assures me. 
"We're not going to fight." 
</P>
<P>
I want to believe him. But when I think back on the arguments that we've had 
since we got married, it seems as if every one began as some petty monetary 
crisis. There was the brawl over whether our food budget was expected to cover 
Milk Bones for my pugs. There was the skirmish over how I could pay 75 cents 
for a can of Diet Coke when Vons was selling six-packs for $1.29. 
</P>
<P>
There was the battle over why two people who had already made the commitment to 
share their lives could not commit to sharing a checking account. 
</P>
<P>
"Show me a couple who's been together for longer than three months who doesn't 
have a conflict about money and I'll show you a his-and-hers crypt at Forest 
Lawn," says Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree. "People are going to argue about money," says Constance Ahrons, 
associate director of the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at USC. "It 
doesn't make much difference whether money is tight or not. People are going to 
fight about money anyway, especially if their values are different." 
</P>
<P>
How different are our values? Let me put it like this. My mother's motto was: 
"The best is none too good." Duke's father taught him that he would go to hell 
if he paid retail. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten much better about money in the last year," Duke reminds me. 
</P>
<P>
This is true. We no longer go to war over sums under $25. We opened a joint 
checking account for household expenses. We saved for vacations. We even filed 
a joint tax return. Still, none of these improvements were made without raising 
our voices. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is probably the major marital problem," says Ahrons. "It's harder to 
talk about than sex." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, money, like sex, is only difficult to discuss with one's partner. 
It's quite a popular topic of conversation among friends. My friend Claire, for 
example, is annoyed because her husband has a strange concept of what is and is 
not economical. "Fred has no problem going to a restaurant and spending $35 
apiece," she complains. "But let one head of 79-cent lettuce go bad in the 
refrigerator, and it's a whole different thing. He goes insane. 
</P>
<P>
"We split most general amounts of money. But I have to go through the phone 
bill and highlight every call that I've made. It's easier than hearing about 
it. I don't want him to say, 'Don't call information,' so I write him a check." 
</P>
<P>
Monica would like to be able to write her husband a check. Jack just announced 
that he doesn't know how she's going to afford to go on their nine-day ski trip 
to Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood there dumbstruck," Monica reported when we met for lunch the other 
day. "And then Jack said in a very smug voice that he can afford to go." 
</P>
<P>
"But you're married," I argued, even though I realize that "for richer and for 
poorer" is a purely academic part of the marriage vow for many double-income 
couples. "Why doesn't he just pay for you? Or lend you the money?" 
</P>
<P>
"He feels that if he makes things easy for me he's setting a precedent that he 
really doesn't want to set," Monica said with a sigh. "And I agree that it's 
very important for me to be contributing half, so I'm my own worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
"In theory, keeping money separate keeps you from fighting about how you spend 
it," says Ahrons. "But what started out as a system to preserve equality and 
independence has sort of run away with itself. It's gotten to a point where 
couples have arguments like, 'You owe me 17 cents for postage stamps.' " 
</P>
<P>
And their accountants find themselves acting as referees. "More and more 
couples are telling me their woes," says Joel Lewinson, our long-suffering CPA. 
"They spill their guts out. Wine, women, whatever. I'm like their financial 
shrink." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't object. "Any accountant can put numbers together," says Joel. 
"To plan ahead, you want to know what everyone's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Often he is the first to know. "I'll be sitting down with a couple doing the 
sale of stocks," he says. "And the husband will turn to the wife and say, 'I 
didn't know you bought that.' Or there's interest from a savings account that 
the wife doesn't know exists. It's a very trying time when couples come in and 
get their taxes done." 
</P>
<P>
What's especially trying? "When I have to go through mental gyrations and do 
the return as if they were single and as if they were joint so they each 
contribute their own fair share," he says. I shuffle my feet guiltily. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I think that life is easier for one-income couples. But recently my 
brother and sister-in-law came to visit from the East Coast. Bobby believes 
that it is his duty as a husband and father to be the breadwinner, and Robbie 
is happy to have bread won for her. As part of their official tour of Los 
Angeles, I took my sister-in-law to visit my favorite soothsayer. "How much 
does your fortuneteller charge?" my brother asked nervously while she was 
having her reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen dollars," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would she take a bribe?" he asked. "I'd give her a grand if she'd look into 
her crystal ball and tell Robbie: 'I see that you spend too much money. You 
don't appreciate how hard your husband works. You really don't need to move to 
a bigger house.' " 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, it turned out that Robbie had already received divine financial 
guidance. She returned from the reading clutching a malachite egg. "It's a 
prosperity crystal," she explained. "The psychic promises that it will make us 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should buy a prosperity crystal," I tell Duke while we're blaming 
each other for the three unrecorded checks in our checkbook. "A really big 
prosperity crystal." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good idea," he says. "Maybe I can find one on sale."

Black shirts, the kind that give a man an air of intrigue, are under 
reconstruction. Far from "basic," the new models have so many extras they make 
the others look as plain as starter homes. There's the playful black shirt with 
silver airplanes for buttons; the fancy-front model with black satin braid; the 
romantic rendition covered with red roses. This new development in menswear has 
a counterpart of sorts in home furniture. Consider an armchair made of 
corrugated cardboard. Designed by architect Frank Gehry, it has all the 
features of the greats from the past: round, rolling arms, an ample back and a 
deep, roomy feeling. But there's no mistaking Gehry's model for a chair from 
another era. The "Sherman," pictured here, is like this season's shirts. It 
moves a classic design into modern times.

LOOKS: SUNSCREEN INFLATION?; 
</P>
<P>
SKIN DOCTORS DEBATE SUN-PROTECTION FACTORS NUMBERED HIGHER THAN 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WHILE sunscreen makers race to put the highest sun-protection-factor numbers on 
product labels, some dermatologists are warning that numbers over SPF 15 may 
represent little more than a marketing ploy. Yet, other doctors encourage 
patients to use products with high SPF numbers. Why the controversy? 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arnold Klein, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA School of 
Medicine, says that labeling products with an SPF greater than 15 may be 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"Higher numbers give people a false sense of security, making them think that 
it is safe to stay in the sun all day. Prolonged exposure to the sun simply 
isn't safe," Klein says. 
</P>
<P>
Most sunscreen preparations do better protecting the skin from the sun's 
burn-producing ultraviolet B (UVB) rays than from UVA or infrared (IR) rays. 
Most products fail to protect the skin from the damaging UVA rays and IR rays. 
Such exposure explains why people tan, even though they are wearing sunscreens 
with high SPF numbers. A tan always represents sun damage to the skin. Such 
damage is cumulative and can result in skin cancer and premature aging of the 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates sunscreen 
products, a lotion labeled SPF 15 allows an individual to remain in the sun -- 
without burning -- 15 times longer than he or she could without the product. 
That is, if it takes a fair-skinned person 10 minutes to show signs of a burn, 
that same person could theoretically remain in the sun for 150 minutes wearing 
an SPF 15. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nelson L. Novick, an associate clinical professor of dermatology at Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine in New York and author of the new book, "Super Skin," 
maintains that numbers higher than SPF 15 are essential, especially in Southern 
California. Novick contends that the amount of protection received from a 
sunscreen is proportionate to the amount applied. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nicholas Lowe, a clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA School of 
Medicine who is writing a medical text about sun protection, suggests wearing 
an SPF 15 every day and using an SPF 29 or 30 during periods of concentrated 
sun exposure, "whenever you're outdoors for more than an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe says he is encouraged by the introduction of a new ingredient called 
Parsol 1789, which blocks UVA rays. He notes that, to date, the only 
over-the-counter product approved by the FDA that includes the ingredient is 
Photoplex by Herbert Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Although dermatologists and other specialists do not appear to agree on SPFs, 
they do concur that there is no such thing as a safe tan and that using a 
sunscreen of at least SPF 15, wearing protective clothing and limiting the 
amount of time spent in the sun are the only ways to protect the skin from 
damaging rays.

damage is caused when people try to conserve their sunscreen, applying too 
little for full protection. "I tell my patients to use an SPF 29 or 30," he 
says. "Then, even if they don't put on enough, they are at least getting the 
protection of about 15." Charles Belongie

Art Garfunkel makes his solo sound track debut when Tri-Star releases "Sing" 
March 3. The lilting half of Simon &amp; Garfunkel performs the anthem, "We'll 
Never Say Goodbye," heard at the finale of the film, which centers on a 
fictional teen couple involved in Sing, a real-life music competition held for 
45 years in the Brooklyn high school system. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than just a gig for Garfunkel -- he and Simon actually competed in 
Sing as teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Co-producer Craig Zadan said that the song, written by screenwriter/composer 
Dean Pitchford and Tom Snow, embodies the film's theme of neighborhood survival 
and the preservation of ethnic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed him (Garfunkel) several key scenes from the movie and played him the 
song," Zadan said. "He went crazy for it. And because he'd been in Sing 
himself, he agreed to do it. In a way, he's completing a cycle." 
</P>
<P>
The soundtrack album and three singles by other artists are due out 
"imminently" from Columbia Records. The idea is to get audience interest 
steamrolling early -- the same marketing ploy used so successfully with 
"Footloose," which Zadan co-produced and Pitchford scripted. John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: MISSING IN ACTION

A hot screen debut in "Bad Boys." Oscar-talk for "La Bamba." So whatever 
happened to Esai Morales? 
</P>
<P>
Well, we would have seen him in Robert Towne's "Tequila Sunrise" -- but his 
scenes were axed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's moviemaking," said a philosophical Morales. He told us it was a small 
role, a couple days' work playing the drug-dealing son of drug dealer Raul 
Julia (Gibson portrays a cocaine dealer trying to go straight). "I did it to 
work with Mel and Robert Towne -- two people I really admire." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed as he added, "I also did it with a Raul Julia-type accent. That was 
the real kick!" 
</P>
<P>
Morales' scenes with Gibson underscored the latter's desire to leave the world 
of drug dealing -- interesting, considering that some critics complained that 
the motivation for Gibson's newfound honesty wasn't terribly clear. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut Morales came during filming. It was based on feelings that 
the scenes just didn't work: "It was extremely difficult for Robert Towne to 
tell me they weren't going to use me. I guess that, classically, so many actors 
are afraid of losing work." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Morales is in the yet-unreleased "Bloodhounds of Broadway," also 
starring Madonna and Matt Dillon. And he's been active as a spokesman, doing 
spots for El Rescate, which provides legal/social services to Central American 
refugees in the L.A. area. Pat H. Broeske

Mrs. Franco's logic escapes me. First she says that she came to agree with her 
husband that their workloads should be along "traditional" lines. She then 
blames the women's movement because she has a double workload, while her 
husband's workload hasn't increased. 
</P>
<P>
What the women's movement taught us was that when two people work outside the 
home, two people work inside the home. If she really wants a traditional 
arrangement, she would quit her outside job.

Regarding the statement "This nostalgia is heightened around the holidays, when 
some contemporary households sit down to meager tables of four or five or less 
-- hardly enough people to pick the smallest turkey clean": I grew up in a 
household of four (myself, my brother, my mother and father), and our table was 
hardly meager. We had as much love and care between the four of us as the 
Francos. It is not size alone that creates a family.

JAIME ESCALANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Jay Mathews' "The Escalante Equation" (Nov. 27), extolling 
the exemplary efforts of Jamie Escalante. Those of us in the educational 
community have been aware for some time of his effective teaching methods. I 
must express some dismay, however, with your opening paragraph, which, in my 
opinion, denigrates the efforts of such educators as Marva Collins and Dr. 
George McKenna. It is unfair to compare these individuals to Escalante. One is 
not better than the other; rather, their efforts are complementary.

SPEAKING THE TRUTH -- WHETHER DARK OR CHEERY; 
</P>
<P>
THE GREATEST PLAYS DON'T TAKE A BENEVOLENT VIEW OF THE HUMAN CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks back I wrote a column wondering why no playwright had written an 
optimistic modern Christmas fable, akin to director Frank Capra's "It's a 
Wonderful Life." I have received an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the Christmas season be any different than the rest of the year?" 
writes Donna Lowre of North Hollywood. "Stories like 'Wonderful Life' aren't 
being written or produced at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many plays are dark and dreary with a malevolent view of what life is all 
about. Art is not news, Mr. Sullivan. It reflects the artist's value judgments. 
In my opinion, it should show life the way it can be and should be. Not the way 
it is at its dreariest level. 
</P>
<P>
"If that isn't true, Mr. Sullivan, then why the popularity of 'It's a Wonderful 
Life'? Why do you yearn for its type of story -- its benevolent view of the 
world and of its heroes who overcome adversity and win? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if reviewers did not praise plays that see man as immoral, or inept, or 
irrational, or drugged out, or hopeless, with no control over his life -- but 
as a rational, intelligent, moral being with a sense of values and a sense of 
humor -- then maybe some changes may start." 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with about 75% of this. I think that art is news -- information 
about the human experience. ("News that stays news," as Ezra Pound said about 
poetry.) This information can come from any level of experience that the artist 
cares to deal with. I'm not calling for someone to write another "It's a 
Wonderful Life" -- not if he doesn't see the world that way. I was wondering 
why nobody had written one. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lowre's letter was a pleasure. First, because we in the stage department 
don't often hear from readers on the big questions. Usually it's a complaint 
about how rude the ushers are at Theater X. 
</P>
<P>
Second, because it is important what kind of stories get acted in a particular 
time. If each era has its climate of opinion, it also has its climate of 
emotion. Plays contribute to this, either directly or in screen translations. 
("Talk Radio," "Torch Song Trilogy" and "Dangerous Liaisons," to name three 
recent examples.) One wants the contribution to be useful. 
</P>
<P>
Only . . . what is useful? What do we need to hear more of from the theater 
right now? What do we need to hear less of? And who decides? 
</P>
<P>
Reader Lowre says that we need to hear more about the human potential for good. 
Yes, always. That's why Robert Harling's "Steel Magnolias" was so satisfying at 
the Pasadena Playhouse last year -- despite all those one-liners. First Harling 
showed a mother and her touchy daughter working out their lines of 
communication, not without static. Then he showed how the mother's friends 
shored her up when she lost her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics thought it a sentimental show. I thought it an observant one. 
Parents and their grown-up children have been known to come to terms. Friends 
do come through in a crisis, sometimes. "Steel Magnolias" admired its people, 
but there was a scene where the mother showed how furious she was at the 
daughter for dying. There's always room for a play like that. 
</P>
<P>
But do we need a generation of plays devoted to the message that friends always 
come through? That people are invariably kind-hearted once you get to know 
them? That for every problem there's a solution? That tomorrow will be better? 
That, all in all, it's a wonderful life? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet theater had 50 years of such plays. Stalin and his successors forced 
Soviet playwrights to write "positive" scripts on the premise that the 
Revolution had purged people of their old selfish ways and created an 
altruistic creature known as the New Soviet Man and Woman. Audiences put up 
with the fiction. But for the truth about human nature -- the whole truth -- 
they went back to Chekhov and Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
American radio and TV have also given us half a century of cheerful family 
comedies where slight domestic misunderstandings are cured by everybody sitting 
down at the table and talking it out. We have also had many a dramatic series 
like "The Waltons," where hard work and family pride got John Boy and his folks 
through the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine for TV, which is meant to put people half to sleep, so that they'll 
be susceptible to the commercials. But imagine a theater that was nothing but 
sitcoms and "The Waltons." 
</P>
<P>
We wouldn't trust it. We'd say: "But it doesn't always work that way. Family 
pride can bring down a family. Hard work isn't enough if you're living in the 
Dust Bowl. Talking-it-out can leave people more embittered than they were 
before. Some people get worse the more you know them." We would also become 
bored. It's difficult to find tension and texture in a play where little is at 
risk. If the characters all mean well, where's your antagonist? If nothing can 
seriously go wrong, where's the suspense? 
</P>
<P>
The playwright doesn't have to deal with life "at its dreariest level." But I 
think we do want him or her to deal with life as it is, even when he sets his 
play in Never-Never Land or Oz, two worlds where defeat was possible. Unless we 
recognize the moral landscape, what good is his parable to us? 
</P>
<P>
We certainly recognize Hamlet's Denmark. In the original legend, a clever 
prince kills his wicked uncle, reclaims his father's crown and marries his 
sweetheart. This is life as it ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare gives us a hero who isn't sure that he is doing the right thing, a 
villain who says his prayers at night and a denouement that would be a comedy 
of errors, except that the players are dying. This is life as it is. On the one 
hand -- "What a piece of work is man." On the other hand, catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Greek tragedy can be read the same way. It's curious that the plays that seem 
to offer the fullest account of the human experience don't offer the 
"benevolent view" that Lowre speaks of, but the tragic view. Rather than 
celebrating life's terrific possibilities, they seem to be warning us not to 
push our sense of those possibilities too far. That message too is always in 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But when Lowre talks about hopeless characters with no control over their 
lives, she is probably not thinking about Oedipus or Lear. Perhaps she is 
thinking of the two tramps in "Waiting for Godot," slogging through the ashes. 
Or maybe she is thinking of the druggies in "Hurlyburly." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Hurlyburly" offers some hope at the end that the hero has bottomed 
out and is ready to clean up his act. And "Godot" suggests that while Godot may 
not be keeping his appointment, the two tramps are keeping theirs. 
</P>
<P>
But the critic isn't there to measure a play's hope-content. He is looking to 
see whether the playwright has put a world on stage that squares with the 
experience of its audience and enlarges it. If so, it's a good play, even when 
its characters aren't behaving admirably. Maybe it's even a positive play, in 
that it may catch the conscience of the viewer. That's why Hamlet put on his 
little show at Elsinore.

STAGE WEEK: 'SPRING' IS REAWAKENING AT THE ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Wedekind's 1890 "Spring Awakening" (newly translated by Rick Foster) 
kicks off "Jugendstil Fest: Young Moderns of 1900," an inter-disciplinary 
tribute -- by the Odyssey Theatre, Pipeline and the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art -- to Germany's turn-of-the-century art movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major play by a major playwright," said Michael Arabian, whose staging 
(featuring a 19-member multiracial cast, aged 16-26) opens Saturday at the 
Odyssey. "Wedekind was the first to investigate art against the status quo -- 
which inspired Brecht's work and the German Expressionism that followed. The 
piece is funny, bizarre, real and true. Music, sound and light effects -- it's 
got everything. It's completely satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
So why is it so rarely done? 
</P>
<P>
"It's done constantly in European theater," said Arabian ("Request Concert," 
"Phantom Limbs"), "though it's always been very controversial. In 1890, it was 
a real slap in the face to society. But it's very relevant -- especially today. 
A lot of issues in it are ones society still has trouble dealing with: 
abortion, suicide, child abuse, teen-age sex, violence. I was amazed at how 
tapped-in Wedekind was to his adolescence." 
</P>
<P>
Pipeline will open a sister piece, "Firewaves," at the Odyssey on Jan. 24, 
featuring choreographer Gilberte Meunier's "Lilies Gone Mad" (performed by 
Meunier and Derek Penfield), Betty Nash's performance dance piece "Reflections" 
(performed by Nash, Will Salmon and Luis Alfaro) and "Breath," a solo movement 
piece by Martin Kersels. How is "Firewaves" connected to the festival? It was 
"created in the avant-garde nature that personifies Jugendstil," according to 
an Odyssey statement. 
</P>
<P>
Also, at LACMA, "Masters of Jugendstil" -- focusing on the decorative arts of 
the period -- is on display through Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
CAMP HUMOR: Originally written more than 30 years ago -- but stalled by 
societal reaction to a "comedy" set in an internment camp -- Hiroshi 
Kashiwagi's "Laughter and False Teeth" receives its world premiere Wednesday at 
East West Players. Robert Ito directs. 
</P>
<P>
For Ito, the piece is less about life in the camps than the human beings in it. 
"In most plays, the camps are depicted as terrible things," said the 
actor-director, whose own family was interned during World War II. "I don't 
think this play wants to dwell on that fact. The (characters) have to deal with 
life. There are rumor-mongers, people who steal -- all of that. 
</P>
<P>
"One character, Madame, attracts lots of men. Another woman, a one-time society 
matron, tries to do charity work inside: she bootlegs liquor in the camp, 
'dispensing happiness and forgetfulness.' And her husband -- who used to be an 
insurance salesman, realizes that with the change he can chuck (his old life 
style), play his flute and be what he wants to be. It shows how we're all 
interned in some way." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS BENEFIT: "Jerry Herman: A Musical Toast" is the theme for the fifth annual 
S.T.A.G.E theatrical benefit for AIDS Project/Los Angeles, taking place Friday 
and Saturday at the Variety Arts Center downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The composer -- whose works include "Hello, Dolly!" "Mame" and "La Cage aux 
Folles" -- will be feted by more than 35 performers, including Lucie Arnaz, 
Jane Carr, Carole Cook, Don Correia, Dorian Harewood and Brad Maule. David 
Galligan directs, with musical direction by Ron Abel and choreography by Gary 
Mascaro. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $40. Ticket information: (213) 380-2000, Ext. 288. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local premiere of another Herman revue, "Jerry's Girls," plays 
at Long Beach's Studio Theatre through Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Milcha Sanchez-Scott's Korean War-themed "Stone Wedding," 
written in collaboration with the Los Angeles Theatre Center's Latino Theatre 
Lab and directed by Jose Luis Valenzuela, received mostly stony reviews. It 
continues at the Los Angeles Theatre Center through Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Sylvie Drake: "Such an eclectic mix of elements presents its 
problems, yet one must hasten to add that it also has humor, snappy dialogue, 
some fine performances and some arresting, painterly sets by Gronk." 
</P>
<P>
From Tom Jacobs in the Daily News: "Collaborative efforts have been known to 
produce good theater, but not often, and certainly not in this case. At its 
worst, the writing in 'Stone Wedding' comes close to self-parody." 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Examiner's Richard Stayton saw "a B horror movie struggling to get 
out of 'Stone Wedding.' Consider the box-office possibilities in the story of a 
paralyzed Latino war veteran whose secret identity is Huitzilopochtli . . . 
Title it 'Mondo Hispanola.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Drama-Logue's T.H. McCulloh: "The talented company does its best and some 
of the performances are strong, though their own material often defeats them. 
It is a scattered work, not saved by Valenzuela's theatrical but muddy staging, 
and some of the committee's ideas just don't work." 
</P>
<P>
Groused Deborah Klugman in the Reader: "A production without focus, without the 
beginning, middle or end of a coherent story line, and with irritating 
pretenses to profundity and great art." 
</P>
<P>
Two thumbs up: In the L.A. Weekly, Maryl Jo Fox found that "No doubt because of 
its collaborative nature, the inevitable rush of events that signifies a 
unified vision is missing. Nevertheless, visually, aurally and conceptually, 
this production is remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
And from the Orange County Register's Jeff Rubio: " 'Stone Wedding' is obscure; 
at times it appears contrived. It has some trouble synergizing the cultural 
forces it tries to harness. Most of the time, though, it's full of life. . . . 
It is at the very least a welcome portal to the mind of a culture."

A JOURNAL'S NO-NONSENSE APPROACH TO AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK, The writer reports regularly on AIDS, including its 
political issues, medical advances, and ethics, for the L.A. Weekly. He also 
contributes features frequently to Calendar on dance and performance art. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AIDS crisis is almost a decade old and the toll within the arts community 
has been catastrophic, but only now has a major national arts service 
organization addressed the widespread fear and confusion that AIDS inspires. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS in the Dance/Arts Work Place," a 32-page special issue of the trade 
journal Update, produced by Dance/USA, offers a no-nonsense approach to 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and the disease's traumatic impact on the 
world of dance. 
</P>
<P>
Its point? To train dance management to look at AIDS as if it were any other 
catastrophic illness afflicting dancers, who are feeling more vulnerable and 
stigmatized than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"A publication like Update could help make all of us deal with AIDS not just 
more compassionately, but also more justly," says David White, executive 
director of New York's Dance Theater Workshop and emcee of the recent Bessie 
Awards (which thoroughly addressed the crisis of AIDS and dance). 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS, particularly on the national level, had always been a taboo subject in 
the dance world. . . . With Update, that's changing." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the 2,000-circulation, Washington-based Update journal deals with 
such subjects as dance funding, government support and taxation issues, career 
moves and new technologies. But Update editor Garth Tate had heard stories 
about dancers and AIDS as early as 1983 and hoped, he says, "to take a 
leadership role with Update . . . (and) be pro-active policy makers in this 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Last November, his hopes were realized. With funding from the National 
Endowment for the Arts' Dance Program, the National Assembly of State Arts 
Agencies, and the members of Dance/USA, Tate compiled and edited what he called 
"the most gratifying experience in my career as a writer" -- a booklet that 
deals with the "ABCs" of AIDS as if the epidemic had just entered the national 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The issue opens with a thorough, if at times emphatically basic, discussion of 
what AIDS is and how it's prevented. There are statistics, charts and diagrams 
about the states and cities hit hardest by AIDS. (New York has the most AIDS 
cases with 17,997; California is at a close second with 15,185). There is also 
a bare bones list of basic treatments, but "alternative therapies" are left to 
physicians and community-based underground "buyer's clubs." 
</P>
<P>
It includes mainstream addresses of AIDS service organizations nationwide, but 
is grossly incomplete when it comes to leading individuals to the 
community-based organizations that can best serve them. 
</P>
<P>
(For example, the organizations that are overlooked in L.A. include Minority 
AIDS Project, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), the Women's AIDS 
Project and Being Alive: a Person with AIDS Action Coalition). 
</P>
<P>
Most strikingly, the publication seeks to puncture the AIDS paranoia still 
ballooning outside major cities by dealing with questions about possible modes 
of transmission among dancers. For instance, Update says that sweat does not 
transfer HIV, (or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which most scientists believe 
causes AIDS), and dancers should not feel at risk if they share costumes. 
However, the sharing of dance shoes should be monitored: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes dancers' feet bleed, and one could conceive that if a dancer were to 
borrow another's shoes that were still bloody, and she has open sores on her 
own feet as well, that transmission could be possible." All the same, the 
publication suggests that it is unlikely that AIDS could be transmitted through 
shoe exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, however, Update's focus is on ethics: philosophical guidelines to 
coping with AIDS in the workplace. "There is no relevant difference between the 
way employers should treat employees with, say, lung cancer or kidney disease 
and the way they should treat people with AIDS or HIV infection," it insists. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the publication is the 10-page transcript of a Dance/USA 1988 
National Round Table in January 1988 called "Addressing AIDS in the Workplace," 
chaired by Gary Dunning, executive director of the Houston Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning counsels against "permitting prejudice to be masked as sound economic 
policy." Most important, he argues vehemently against "dealing with AIDS on a 
case-by-case basis." He says "the lack of a consistent and iron-clad policy 
could leave a company open to potential legal action and charges of 
unfairness." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who harasses a co-worker about being HIV-positive should be reprimanded 
or eventually dismissed, says the booklet, and a company manager should not 
make the mistake of asking an HIV-infected dancer how she or he feels so often 
as to be oppressive or fatalistic. As Tate recognizes, "there is a clear 
distinction between AIDS and HIV." 
</P>
<P>
Update consistently counsels that, "the relevant standard is job performance, 
which should be applied fairly and consistently." 
</P>
<P>
Given the praise from management in the dance world, Tate hasn't received 
nearly as much feedback from individual dancers. He's worried that the "artists 
may have no idea what their rights are." 
</P>
<P>
His fears are well-founded. The weakness of the booklet is that it addresses 
AIDS as if it were an occupational hazard, avoiding the personal touch that the 
publi-cation itself calls for. 
</P>
<P>
Update's greatest faux pas is that in all of its 32 pages, the only person who 
speaks openly about having AIDS is "a well-known Hollywood hairdresser." 
</P>
<P>
While the hairdresser's advice is well taken ("Don't monitor my health: The 
most annoying thing is when people continually ask you how you are with that 
very concerned tone in their voice"), it's undercut by the fact that he does 
not speak as a representative of dancers or their managers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tate's the first to admit that the publication isn't "complete" and "the 
last word on the subject." He is aware that it's geared less to individual 
artists than it is to companies. "But we have to begin somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In the dance world, the tendency is to applaud any gesture that attempts to 
confront the magnitude of AIDS -- no matter how "safe" and non-controversial it 
is. In fact, the Update booklet on AIDS shows how far the dance community has 
yet to go and how much AIDS denial clouds any truly aggressive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Tate argues, there was such a pressing need for direction during this 
epidemic, why wait until 1988 to publish an AIDS guide? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be dishonest to suggest that there was no denial on the part of the 
dance community in dealing with AIDS," Tate answers. "For years we heard horror 
stories -- especially as regards insurance companies refusing to represent 
dance companies. It took even longer for dancers to talk about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Tate argues that a "lack of leadership on the national level" caused AIDS to be 
immediately stigmatized as a gay disease. "Not only did this make it difficult 
to be gay in the mid-'80s," he adds, "it also made it very difficult to be a 
male dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that in many ways this publication may be somewhat dated -- 
AIDS treatment and legislation change everyday -- but there may be a dancer in 
Kansas somewhere who wants to take an AIDS test but is frightened about the 
consequences. This booklet can help him or her. It can help dancers inform 
their company mangers about what they should be doing to prepare for the AIDS 
hurricane about to hit." Although as many people have died from AIDS in the 
last nine years as died in the Vietnam War, Tate says "We haven't even seen the 
tip of the AIDS iceberg in this country." "Millions of people are infected 
because our President did not go all out and call for AIDS education. Every 
corporation, every work place, will have to address the very same issues we're 
addressing: How to be fair, consistent and compassionate. How do deal with 
finances and hysteria? How to be aggressive leaders? "My message to the dancers 
and company managers out there is to take the initiative and educate yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dance/USA has received a grant from the Dayton-Hudson Foundation to reprint 
another 2,000 copes of "AIDS in the Dance/Arts Work Place." It is available to 
dancers free of charge and to the general public for $2. Information: 
Dance/USA, 777 14th St., NW Washington, D.C. 20005; or call: (202) 628-0144.

MOST DANCERS APPLAUD AIDS BOOKLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK

<TEXT>
<P>
Dancers around the country are slowly learning about Update's AIDS guide. The 
response is strong in New York and in the South but weaker farther West. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based choreographer Kathryn Posin says that "this glut of AIDS info -- 
however basic as it may be -- has never been compiled in one booklet for 
dancers before. It could prove amazingly handy and useful to companies in the 
boonies." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Sygoda, director of Pentacle, a respected service organization for New 
York artists, said the booklet "would be especially helpful to companies 
outside the New York area who don't have easy access to AIDS information and 
are still sticking their heads in the sand about this terrible epidemic that's 
touched us all." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, two of the most respected modern-dance choreographers and 
company leaders -- Rudy Perez and Bella Lewitzky -- seem in the process of 
addressing the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Bella (Lewitzky) has always been an activist regarding AIDS," explained 
Darlene Neel, Lewitzky Dance Company manager, who recalls that in 1983 Lewitzky 
invited a speaker from AIDS Project Los Angeles to talk about safe-sex 
practices with dancers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we do have an AIDS policy," adds Neel. "Bella's made it a policy 
to protect dancers' confidentiality and health insurance when it comes to any 
illness. Yet, I'm convinced that Update could assist all dance companies in 
continuing the necessary dialogue in confronting a disease that strikes the 
young and healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said he has never had to confront the problem of a dancer having AIDS but 
is well aware of colleagues whose entire companies have been decimated. "I 
don't know what I would do if a dancer had such bad news," he said. "I've 
honestly never thought about it before. It's hard to know where to turn." Now 
he feels there is a place. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.-based choreographer Mary Jane Eisenberg said that long before she had 
heard of Update's guide, she had thought about "AIDS touching our company -- 
how can you not these days?" and added that "because our company is like a 
family, we would deal with that problem in very personal terms. The booklet 
would provide a tool." 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Miller, an Atlanta choreographer and prominent Southern activist, was 
much more informed about the "devastation" of AIDS in the South and of the 
beneficial effects of Update's AIDS booklet. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are still at various levels of education and denial," Miller said. 
"I'm very tuned into the disease and how vulnerable artists are and the abyss 
that's out there for all of us who maybe know someone battling AIDS. But I 
think Update could help elevate the level of discussion throughout the dance 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Faucett, general manager of the New Orleans City Ballet, applauds Update. 
"We've been hit hard by AIDS in our city," she says, "yet we need as much 
direction and even confrontation as we can get." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Lerman, artistic director of the Washington-based Dance Exchange, believes 
that "we in the dance world have lived with this problem since day one," adding 
that "now that the entire country is facing AIDS, it's high time that we speak 
in clear terms about issues of policy and modes of behavior that point to a 
raised consciousness. This is all that Update provides, but it is all that we 
need: the equivalent of a moral reminder." DOUGLAS SADOWNICK

... AND INTRODUCING THE CLASS OF '89; 
</P>
<P>
HERE'S WHAT MADE THE NEW INDUCTEES THE GREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roll call time for the new members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will be 
Wednesday night at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City: Dion, Otis 
Redding, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder join the 30 
other acts inducted since the Hall was established three years ago (though the 
groundbreaking for the Hall's I.M. Pei-designed Cleveland home has yet to be 
scheduled). 
</P>
<P>
Also honored this year in the early influences category will be blues belter 
Bessie Smith, vocal group the Ink Spots and the gospel Soul Stirrers, while 
"wall of sound" producer Phil Spector was selected as a non-performing member. 
</P>
<P>
Dion 
</P>
<P>
Like the fabled Rose of Spanish Harlem, "doo-wop" vocal groups -- thus named 
due to their practice of reducing background vocal parts to a stream of 
nonsense syllables -- grew in the street, right up through the concrete back in 
the '50s. At least 5,283 of these pimply mooks made records, of which Dion 
&amp; the Belmonts' were arguably the baddest of 'em all -- mostly because lead 
singer Dion DiMucci was the best white vocalist in the idiom. 
</P>
<P>
While the tracks waxed with the Belmonts ranged from such monumental towers of 
babble as "I Wonder Why" (distinguished by a second verse that contains not a 
single word in English) to an uncomfortably ethereal version of the pre-rock 
standard "Where or When," Dion's single finest vocal performance comes on his 
1960 solo recording of "Ruby Baby," which blows no less than the Drifters' 
original version into the next galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
How? Well, partially it's due to the incredibly sexy edge that he puts on every 
syllable and partially it's due to the incredibly cat-footed sense of rhythm he 
displays, but mostly it's due to the stoned immaculate timing of the vocal 
asides ("nowlistennow") of which the record is a virtual compendium. This was 
the moment on which the myth of Dion as the apotheosis of sharkskinned hipster, 
the paragon of gesture (in this case, finger-snappin' cool), the teen-aged 
missing link between Frank Sinatra and Bobby "Blue" Bland, the Eternal 
Wanderer, was made. 
</P>
<P>
This myth takes on a further resonance with the knowledge that along with his 
string of hits ("The Wanderer," "Runaround Sue" et al), Dion was himself strung 
out on heroin. Eventually he kicked the habit and mounted a '68 comeback with 
the reflective "Abraham, Martin and John." After several years of semi-success, 
he moved into the realm of 
</P>
<P>
contemporary Christian music and is currently preparing a new album of secular 
material for Arista. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Redding 
</P>
<P>
There are people who'll tell you that the Big O was the greatest soul singer to 
ever trod sod. There are others who maintain that Redding's death in a 1967 
plane crash -- months after he'd been one of the few blacks to perform at the 
Monterey Pop Festival -- did more to catapult the Macon, Ga., native into the 
pantheon of hipster saints than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
But any discussion of Redding's career must be tempered with the knowledge that 
he was only 26 when he died and that the posthumous "(Sittin' on) The Dock of 
the Bay" was not only his biggest pop hit, but also his most contemplative, 
least affected work to date. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. Redding was a powerful vocalist, equally adept at 
anguished, churchy ballads ("I've Been Loving You Too Long," "Try a Little 
Tenderness") as he was at driving, all-stops-out, up-tempo tunes ("I Can't Turn 
You Loose," "Respect"). When his patented, stuttering, "gotta-gotta-gotta" 
approach worked, as on the classic "Live in Europe" album, the effect was 
singsational. When the tunes weren't there, the performances too often 
collapsed into mannerism at the expense of genuine emotional expression. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, an artist must be judged by his best work, and seeing as 
how Redding not only wrote almost all his own hits, but also penned Arthur 
Conley's "Sweet Soul Music," only the tragically hip would deny that the man 
merits inclusion strictly on the basis of the recorded evidence. Sleep on, 
Otis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones 
</P>
<P>
Mean, moody and magnificent. The self-proclaimed "greatest rock 'n' roll band 
in the world" would almost qualify for Hall of Fame status on the strength of 
its bad-boy image alone. But no one maintains a 25-year career strictly on the 
ability to raise eyebrows -- look though the "Drummers Wanted" ads of any 
musicians classified section and count how many people are looking for a 
"Charlie Watts-type drummer." That ain't image, that's real life -- and that is 
what the Rolling Stones have always been about. Hard knocks and dirty sox. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwild, in the capable hands, lips and hips of Mick Jagger (who knew a thing 
or two about performin') even the earliest Stones live shows redefined all 
previous notions of sexuality and showmanship. Musically, there's not much to 
say at this point. The Stones started out as a high-level rock/blues combo and 
recorded about four albums' worth of mostly old R&amp;B tunes ("It's All Over 
Now," "Time Is On My Side"), most of which were as stunning as they were almost 
unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred on to ever-greater heights of outrage by their first manager, Andrew 
Loog Oldham, the Jagger/Keith Richards team exploded as songwriters, composing 
such bedrock numbers as "Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black." Ah, but it's with 
the series of LPs that began with "Beggars Banquet" and continued through 
"Exile on Main Street" that the Stones really hit their peak. 
</P>
<P>
Though still capable of occasional flashes of brilliance -- notably, the "Some 
Girls" LP -- it is this late '60s/early '70s stretch that has proven so rich, 
so durable, so amoral that neither the Stones nor anybody else has been able to 
improve upon it much since. 
</P>
<P>
The Temptations 
</P>
<P>
Although the Supremes were Motown's most-successful act, it was their male 
counterparts, the Temptations, who had the reputation for being able to 
"outsing, outdance, and outdress" any vocal group in sight. 
</P>
<P>
While the Detroit-based quintet always prided itself on being a group with five 
lead singers, it wasn't until 1968's "I Can't Get Next to You" that 
writers/producers Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong took a page from the Sly 
Stone songbook and constructed an entire tune around the concept of constantly 
shifting leads. 
</P>
<P>
The team then grafted the style to such sociologically significant themes as 
drugs ("Cloud Nine") and the fatherless family ("Papa Was a Rollin' Stone") to 
create some of the most grimly realistic slices of ghetto life to grace the 
upper reaches of the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The group's earliest hits were more conventional, showcasing either the 
scorched-earth baritone of David Ruffin ("Ain't Too Proud to Beg" and "My 
Girl") or the stratospheric tenor of Eddie Kendricks ("Just My Imagination"). 
</P>
<P>
Along with basso profundo Melvin Franklin, founder Otis Williams and the late 
Paul Williams (no relation), this first edition of the Temptations was as 
versatile as the second, they just didn't pack it all into one three-minute 
song. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was the second edition, in which Ruffin was replaced by 
ex-Contours member Dennis Edwards and ex-Monitor Richard Street filled in for 
Paul Williams (who wound up a 1973 suicide), that went on to greater heights 
and is still out there scoring R&amp;B hits, dazzling three generations' worth 
of audiences and inspiring such spiritual godsons as the Jacksons and the New 
Edition night after night after night. Temptations sing! 
</P>
<P>
Stevie Wonder 
</P>
<P>
Born blind, this charter member of the Motown family signed his first contract 
at age 8, landed his first hit ("Fingertips, Part 2") four years later and 
hasn't really looked back since. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder has never limited his music to strictly R&amp;B, although "Uptight," "I 
Was Made to Love Her" and "Superstition" are all so tough, you'd have to shave 
'em with a blowtorch, and over the years he's ventured into reggae ("Master 
Blaster"), jazz ("Sir Duke"), Dylan covers ("Blowin' in the Wind") and Las 
Vegas lounge lizardry ("For Once in My Life"). 
</P>
<P>
When Wonder turned 21, he negotiated a multimillion dollar contract that not 
only set industry superstar standards, but also gave him unprecedented control 
over his recordings. Together with Marvin Gaye's ground-breaking "What's Going 
On" album, Wonder's earth-shattering "Talking Book" LP sounded the death knell 
for Motown's old system-of-specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Through the '70s, Wonder's mixture of percolating synths and Pollyannaish 
social comments remained wildly popular. Lately, however, the records have 
become more infrequent, and his greatest success has come via gooey ballads ("I 
Just Called to Say I Love You"), so it's somewhat understandable that his 
standing among dyed-in-the-black-leather-jacket rock fans has slipped a bit. 
Nevertheless, Wonder's talent is such that he could get a hit tune out of an 
electric toaster, and many of us would not be surprised if in the very near 
future he did.

POPLINE: 'TIL TUESDAY'S AIMEE MANN, BUCK OWENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER and CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the third album from 'Til Tuesday, "Everything's Different Now," Aimee Mann 
-- she of the shocking blond hair, piercing blue eyes and fragile voice -- 
writes with amazing clarity and astonishing candor of a real-life romantic 
breakup. 
</P>
<P>
"I did feel a bit wary with this album that I might face a bunch of 'Here comes 
Aimee again being gloomy and horrible.' . . . If they paid attention, they'd 
think I was pretty resilient," Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for all concerned when relationships don't continue, and 
if you're trying to save one, it puts you into a really difficult position, but 
it's not particularly a whiny position -- I mean, most of it is like a fighting 
position, it's quite aggressive. It's hard not to feel sad, but sad doesn't 
mean that you're a victim." 
</P>
<P>
The ex-beau in the affair in question is Jules Shear, leader of the band 
Reckless Sleepers and writer of Top 10 singles for Cyndi Lauper and the 
Bangles. They speak, but relations are still strained. 
</P>
<P>
Shear said in a recent Times article that he thought Mann's new songs were 
first-rate, even though they didn't always paint his role in the demise of the 
relationship in the most favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said she does know at least one track bothered Shear -- "The Other End of 
the Telescope," co-written by Mann and their mutual acquaintance, Elvis 
Costello -- "although he likes it now. It bothered him because it was sort of 
that harsh Elvis vibe." 
</P>
<P>
"He's actually quite concerned what people think of him on one level," claimed 
Mann. "Yeah, a lot of the album is about him, and some of it's not, and the 
stuff that's about him is not word for word anyway because everybody always 
writes in a bit of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as somebody like Jules goes, he drives quite hard to not appear 
autobiographical, but he's amazingly so. He's just not somebody who likes to 
admit it because he feels like it's gonna be used against him. That's kind of 
my whole thing -- I know it can't be. How could just telling the truth about 
your experiences be used against you? Because you know what it meant. To me 
it's not a weakness to be honest."CHRIS WILLMAN

POP EYE: PRINCE BEHIND THE PURPLE CURTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's going on behind the Purple Curtain? 
</P>
<P>
The biggest story in the music industry last week was Prince's stunning 
realignment of his royal court. The flamboyant pop star not only severed his 
ties with his longtime management team, lawyer and business manager, but 
announced he was now being managed by "Purple Rain" writer-director Albert 
Magnoli, who's never managed anyone before in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Prince nor Magnoli nor Warner Bros., Prince's label, would comment on 
these dramatic career moves, which came after months of rumors of financial and 
career setbacks. (Ousted manager Steve Fargnoli would only call the parting 
"amicable.") 
</P>
<P>
So what's the real story? 
</P>
<P>
We spoke to a host of industry insiders, who each asked anonymity, saying they 
didn't want to jeopardize their relationships with many of the players cited 
below. They offer an intriguing account of the recent behind-the-scenes 
maneuvers in Prince's topsy-turvy career. Here are some of the key questions 
people in the industry are asking -- with answers culled from our interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Why did Prince hire a film director to manage his career? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The move doesn't make sense -- unless you're planning to spend the next 
several years making a movie. According to several sources in the Hollywood 
community, Prince and Magnoli are planning a musical film, which, though it 
would not be a sequel to "Purple Rain," would aim for a broad youth audience 
and generate a commercial sound track. "If Prince is making a movie, he's not 
going to be on the road, so why does he need a heavy-hitter?" said one manager. 
"In fact, it makes a lot of sense to kill two birds with one stone -- let your 
manager be your film director!" 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is Prince in financial trouble? 
</P>
<P>
A: It depends who you ask. According to several key attorneys and managers -- 
yes. They pointed to Prince's lavish Paisley Park studio complex outside 
Minneapolis, which reportedly cost $8 million to $10 million to build -- and 
more to operate. They point to his lengthy 1988 tours, which by most accounts 
lost huge sums of money. They also point to the lack of income from his Paisley 
Park custom record label, which has released a string of commercial failures 
(including forgettable albums from the Family, Three O'Clock and Dale Bozzio). 
"He has severe money problems right now," said one record company exec. "He 
spends and spends, but he's not making anywhere near the money he used to. I've 
heard estimates of his overhead that run more than $500,000 a month." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. "His individual companies could have financial trouble, 
but it's hard to image Prince having personal money woes," said one manager. 
"He has a publishing company which owns all his songs, which must be worth at 
least $15 to $25 million. So don't expect him to go broke." 
</P>

Q: Prince's new law firm is Ziffren, Brittenham and Branca. But while John 
Branca is one of the record industry's top lawyers, it's his partner, Skip 
Brittenham, an attorney with influential film and TV clients (including 
Magnoli) who's actually handling Prince. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: Insiders say Branca, whose best-known client is Michael Jackson, wants to 
keep his distance -- at least officially -- from Prince. "John's been on the 
phone telling everyone he wasn't involved in this signing," said one L.A.-based 
manager. "And even if he cleared this with Michael Jackson beforehand, he 
obviously doesn't want Michael becoming jealous of any time he might be 
devoting to Prince's career." Another possible reason for the legal move: 
Branca's firm has strong ties with Prince's record company, representing a host 
of Warner artists, including George Harrison, David Lee Roth, Fleetwood Mac, 
Peter Cetera and Los Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
A question now being debated in industry corridors: Is it a conflict of 
interest for the same law firm to represent both an artist and his manager? If 
Prince were to have a falling-out with Magnoli, which side would the firm take? 
The loser in the legal shake-up was Lee Phillips, Prince's longtime attorney 
and a respected industry power broker. According to several sources who spoke 
with Phillips and members of his law firm, Phillips was so stunned by the 
departure that he wrote Prince a lengthy note, which prompted a conciliatory 
phone call from the reclusive pop star. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do these career moves say about Prince's future? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most industry experts say Prince could easily bounce back, if the 
obsessively shy performer can make contact with the outside world. "His 
greatest gift -- and his greatest curse -- is how incredibly prolific he is," 
said one veteran manager. "Even too much lobster will kill you. And he's given 
the public too many albums -- more than they can digest -- so he's lost touch 
with much of his audience. I saw him at a New Year's Eve party and I got the 
sense that he was really frightened -- and very alone. He's this wonderfully 
gifted, very child-like character. But now he's hit 30. And you can't be Tinker 
Bell all your life. You've got to grow up. And maybe that's what he's going 
through now."

KISS ME DEADLY: Can a rock video slander a building? That's what attorneys for 
New York real estate baron William Kaufman contend. In fact, they've filed suit 
in Manhattan Supreme Court for a temporary injunction to prevent MTV from 
airing "Let's Put the X in Sex," a popular Kiss clip that features the band 
performing in front of a 42-story office tower owned by Kaufman's Sage Realty. 
"It's pretty obvious it's supposed to be a 42-story phallic symbol," Kaufman 
attorney Bob Ward told the New York Post. "They are panning up and down, 
shooting (Kiss bassist) Gene Simmons' crotch. It's not the kind of thing we 
want our client associated with. It is a fancy building that seeks high rents 
from tenants." 
</P>
<P>
Ward also claimed that Kiss shot the video under false pretenses, saying it was 
for a high-fashion video. Not so, says Kiss management, who said the realtor 
was given a contract clearing stating the clip was intended as a rock video. 
"I'll never look at the New York skyline the same way again," Kiss vocalist 
Paul Stanley told Pop Eye. "But I think it's hysterical. It's especially funny 
that they're the ones who are calling their own building a phallic symbol, not 
us. The way I look at it, if they're building 42-story phallic symbols, they 
should at least put a sleeve on them." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley also disputed Ward's claim that Kiss' video pans up and down Gene 
Simmons' crotch. "Just so none of our fans get the wrong idea," he said. "It's 
my crotch."

ART NEWS: PRISONERS SPEAK IN 'ANOTHER COUNTRY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does art by inmates jailed for everything from drunk driving to rape and 
murder look like? Paintings of angry, tattooed men, bloody fist fights, cramped 
cells and windows with black bars generally come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
But generalizations and stereotypes can prove false. Case in point: "Light From 
Another Country: Art From California Prisons," opening Monday at Claremont 
Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
The grim vision of an inmate dumping garbage, a hated task performed by all, is 
one of the show's few works that bespeak the dark side of prison life. Instead, 
brightly colored, vibrant scenes of subject matter far removed from 
incarceration dominate the multimedia exhibit with works by 30 inmates and 15 
professional artists who teach art in prisons throughout the state for the 
California Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
"People frequently think that there's going to be a lot of tension and violence 
in the (inmates') work," said William Cleveland, who runs the 
Art-In-Corrections program. "But in fact, when people are deprived of nature 
and relationships, their imagination is a marvelous tool, and often their art 
reflects what they don't have or what they wish they had." 
</P>
<P>
Relationships, family and freedom, "or a yearning for freedom," are recurring 
themes in the inmates' work, Cleveland said. For instance, there's a 
photo-realistic painting by Alain Corbisier depicting three generations of a 
family happily clustered around a sunny picnic table. A surreal self-portrait 
by Steven King Ainsworth shows him standing beside a keyhole leading to the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
The professional artists' works are included to prove that the prison program 
is a two-way street, Cleveland said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than just passing on information, the teachers end up collaborating 
with their students and you can see that in the work. You can see the teacher's 
influence on students and see the influence of the students and the prison 
environment on the teacher." 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the inmates' work varies, said Jeanne La Barbera, gallery 
director at Cal State Polytechnic, which hosted the exhibit in November. Some 
looks professional, she said, and some does not. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not what the show is about. It's about the opportunity for 
individuals we don't normally encounter to communicate with us. Some of the 
less polished pieces are among the most touching because they are done by 
people who don't have much formal training, but have something to say, whether 
it be about loneliness for their family or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Studies done by the Art-In-Corrections program show declining recidivism rates 
for inmates involved in the 10-year-old project, said Cleveland, a musician and 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line here is that people who have only found their identity and 
self-worth in predatory and destructive behavior are given the opportunity to 
transfer their anger, their intensity and their negative energy into a 
creative, constructive activity that is well thought of and accepted by 
society," he said. "For a lot of them, it's their first legitimate success in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"Light From Another Country," through Feb. 3, is presented in the Galleries of 
the Claremont Graduate School Graduate Art Program, 251 E. 10th St., Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS GALORE: Thirteen Southern California museums and arts institutions have 
won $721,100 in grants for special exhibitions from the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The local recipients, among 118 institutions nationwide awarded a total of $6 
million, are: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, $320,000; Museum of Contemporary Art, 
$140,000; La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, $118,300; Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions, $28,500; Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, 
$19,900; Newport Harbor Art Museum, $17,400; University Art Gallery, Cal State 
Long Beach, $17,000; Fellows of Contemporary Art, $12,500; Cal State Fullerton 
Art Gallery, $12,000; California Museum of Photography, UC Riverside, $10,000;

$5,000.

Shall we "do brunch"? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, no. No, no, no. Not this morning. We can't face eggs Benedict at all today, 
and if we have to look one more carved ham in the face we're going to throw a 
melon ball at somebody. It won't be a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
The very idea is giving us a headache. Well, possibly we already had the 
headache, but anyway we've got to get out of the house . . . and get something 
to eat, that much is clear. 
</P>
<P>
Not eggs Benedict, though, anything but eggs Benedict. It may be brunch time, 
but today we need a Brunch From Beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean. Aha. Huevos negros: eggs crusted with an ominous black paste of 
chiles. They look like truck-stop fried eggs in hell. They also taste like 
fried eggs from hell, ferociously hot. Just what we wanted, the exact opposite 
of eggs Benedict. With a plate of these little puppies and maybe a hasty gallon 
of ice water, we're feeling better already. 
</P>
<P>
This is Cafe Mambo, a bright, informal little place that always has fun art on 
the walls. It may be a little loud for brunch, but it's open early and the 
eclectic food goes a long way toward curing brunch melancholia. In addition to 
spicy things like chilaquiles (eggs, chorizo and tortilla chips scrambled 
together) there are hotcakes and more conventional breakfast items. And the 
coffee is whimsically flavored with vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Mambo, 707 Heliotrope St., Hollywood. (213) 663-5800. Saturday and Sunday 
brunch from 9 a.m. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Brunch for 
two, food only, $10-$20. 
</P>
<P>
Greek. Oh boy, a show. Waiters with Greek accents are flourishing plates at us. 
First there are salads and Near Eastern dips -- hummus, baba ghannouj and 
taramosalata (all pretty good, though the hummus could use more sesame). 
</P>
<P>
Then they bring out crisp-fried calamari, a homey dish of pasta baked with 
ground beef and cream sauce called pastitsio, rather plain beef meatballs and 
grape leaves generously stuffed with beef in a piquant dill-egg-lemon sauce. 
The star is a truly wonderful moussaka. Its beef filling is thick and spicy 
with cinnamon and clove, and the eggplant layer is topped with the fluffiest 
egg custard. 
</P>
<P>
The secret here is to order either espresso or Greek coffee afterward, because 
it comes with lumps of "Greek Delight," a jellied rosewater candy that is 
perfect for this hour of the morning: not too chewy and not too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Greek, 13362 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 905-5250. Sunday 
brunch from 11:30 a.m. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two, 
sparkling wine included, $25.90. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian. All right. This is definitely exotic. On weekdays Keste Demena is 
your typical little Ethiopian restaurant with travel posters on the walls and 
spicy stewed lamb dishes on the menu, but on Sundays it serves five Ethiopian 
breakfast dishes, all liberally laced with red pepper and richly aromatic 
Ethiopian spiced butter. They're a little bit like nursery food, but definitely 
for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Some are a bit like porridge, some are bready. One of the best is shehan fuul, 
boiled fava beans topped with chopped onions, tomatoes and green peppers, to 
say nothing of lime juice, cayenne and mass quantities of spiced butter. The 
most substantial dish, and possibly the hottest, is tire sega, a real caveman 
meal of chunks of very tender raw beef served on sourdough Ethiopian injera 
bread with a mound of peppery spice paste. 
</P>
<P>
Keste Demena Ethiopian Restaurant, 5779 W. Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 
933-6522. Sunday brunch from 10 a.m. American Express, MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Brunch for two, food only, $5.50 to $14.50. 
</P>
<P>
Cajun. As a meal, brunch has one big failing -- not enough emphasis on 
staggeringly rich desserts. We're tempted to stop off and have some ice cream 
in order to achieve the proper aesthetic balance for this hour of morning. In 
fact, let's. 
</P>
<P>
No, let's not. Instead, we'll go to Patout's. We'll eat homey Cajun food from a 
menu that changes every weekend, and we'll listen to a fairly loud 
Cajun/C&amp;W band. Oysters Alexander has a slightly peppery shrimp topping, 
much like the one on the lima beans and the wonderfully hearty whipped 
potatoes. Shrimp creole comes with a thick tomato sauce. And Patout's peculiar 
gumbo is rather like plain chicken soup. 
</P>
<P>
All are mere prelude. The whole point of brunch here is the rich Southern 
desserts, such as warm bread pudding with bourbon sauce or a sweet potato-pecan 
pie with a crisp, biscuit-like crust and a sweet potato filling topped with 
plenty of pecans. 
</P>
<P>
Patout's, 2260 Westwood Blvd., West Los Angeles. (213) 475-7100. Sunday brunch 
from 11:30 a.m. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two, with sparkling 
wine, $36. 
</P>
<P>
Indian. It certainly looks like we're in for brunch here. This pink and 
burgundy room with tall mirrors and planter boxes around the walls is 
suspiciously brunch-like. It could pass for one of those hotel ballrooms where 
brunch might be served buffet-style from . . . hey, they are serving brunch 
from steam tables. 
</P>
<P>
But it's Indian food: beef and lamb shish kebabs, lamb curry with lots of 
ground onions, chicken curry heavy on the turmeric, and tandoori chicken 
(served cold). Lots of vegetarian dishes, too: pilaf heavy on the black cumin, 
several mixed vegetable curries, nice light spinach fritters (pakora), yellow 
lentils and so on. Nothing is terribly spicy, but the traditional mint chutney 
and a sort of cabbage and pea curry comes close. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the Indian sweets is the honey-soaked cake rasgola, for once 
neither soggy nor stale. And it's topped with edible silver foil. Yes, you can 
actually eat a precious metal for breakfast here. 
</P>
<P>
We definitely feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord's, 50 N. La Cienega, Beverly Hills. (213) 652-3838. Saturday and Sunday 
brunch from noon. All major credit cards accepted. Brunch for two, sparkling 
wine included, $25.90.

BRUNCH: THE MISSING LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the '70s, the decadence of ancient times could be found at big-city 
discotheques, college fraternity toga parties and all-you-could-eat brunches 
(champagne included) in Marina del Rey. King Tut was front-page news, Cher 
looked like Cleopatra and Plato's Retreat was hot. Now discos are turning into 
supper clubs, and Cher's Cleo look, like Tut and togas and Plato's, is a 
distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains is brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Brunch is the culinary missing link to hearty eaters of the past. Look back in 
history and you'll find that while brunch wasn't institutionalized until the 
'60s and '70s, the concept of voluptuous eating goes back to ancient times. A 
comparison between Barbara Norman's "Tales of the Table," an authoritative work 
on the history of Western cuisine, and more contemporary sources from the '80s 
reveals that the spirit of excess survives in the weekend brunch: 
</P>
<P>
Then: "The scale of feasts of the past is almost unbelievable . . . literally 
hundreds of cattle were slaughtered." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "The (hotel) goes through 60 gallons of eggs, 12 gallons of salads, 75 
pounds of bacon and up to 16 cases of champagne, plus other offerings and 
desserts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on an Orange County brunch 
</P>
<P>
Then: ". . . As many as 30,000 individual dishes (were) presented on the menu." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "Feed from the restaurant's eight stations, which include an eggs Benedict 
station, a Belgian waffles stop, a build-your-own-omelet bar, a fajitas bar, a 
fresh fruit and salad bar, shrimp and ceviche bar, an oyster and clam bar . . . 
and a hot fudge sundae bar." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on a Mother's Day brunch 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Food (was) ground to a pulp and mixed with sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "Strawberry soup is refreshing, though creamy enough to clog the arteries 
of a marathon runner." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on a resort brunch item 
</P>
<P>
Then: " 'So the whole day long till sundown we sat and feasted on our rich 
supply of meat washed down by mellow wine,' (Homer writes) as Odysseus and his 
companion consume a large ram offered to Zeus." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: Chuck -- "You say you're kind of wild?" TV game show contestant -- "That's 
right, Chuck. For instance, my girlfriends and I will get together during the 
weekend and go to brunch." Chuck -- "Brunch? Brunch is wild?" Contestant -- 
"Well, yeah. I mean brunch can last all day -- sometimes 14 or 15 hours." Chuck 
-- "O-kaay." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Love Connection" 
</P>
<P>
Then: "The endless eating alternated with jousts or hunts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "Not only will the Easter bunny hop about the premises and pose with 
youngsters who want complimentary picture-souvenirs, there's a petting zoo too, 
with real live rabbits, chickens and goats. Work up a healthy appetite at the 
Easter egg hunt. " 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on Easter brunches 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Feasts were also politically useful, both in cementing ties and in 
impressing . . . dignitaries." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "The women meet once a month in the Glendale YWCA on East Lexington Avenue 
for political briefings, legislative 'action alerts' on bills in Sacramento and 
the study of global issues, along with brunch." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on a Republican women's study group 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Courses of food were interspersed with wild practical jokes, outlandish 
pageants, and pantomimes with ingenious mechanical devices and animated 
figures." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "At the brunch, the entertainment will begin with a marching band and will 
continue with a jazz group, a mariachi band and a troupe of mimes and 
jugglers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on a Super Bowl day brunch 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Feasting was not all fun. Starting with the early Greek religious rites, 
public feasts were an instrument for satisfying the public and keeping the poor 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "Amid the graffiti-covered warehouses south of downtown, brunch and Easter 
services (were provided) to more than 2,000 homeless men, women and children. . 
. . A block of 5th Street was cordoned off and metal folding chairs and tables 
were covered festively with pink cellophane. Volunteers served up a meal of 
hard-boiled eggs, corned beef hash, peaches, doughnuts and fruit punch." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The L.A. Times on Easter activities 
</P>
<P>
Then: "When there is too much wealth and leisure, cooking, like all arts, 
lapses into a decadance in which cost and elaborate form take precedence over 
taste and content." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tales of the Table" 
</P>
<P>
Now: "(Brunch) assumes, as do so many of our urban appurtenances, a measure of 
social significance, and so the selection of where one . . . makes a brunch 
appearance, becomes in many cases far more important than the quality of the 
food to be consumed because in a real sense, when you choose your brunch you 
choose your caste, you opt for a certain set."

NOTEBOOK: CHEF'S RULE FOR REWRITING MENUS: DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Healy, chef and co-owner of the justly popular Champagne in West Los 
Angeles, called the other day to chat about something that's been bothering him 
-- a tendency on the part of some of his customers to want to rewrite his 
menus. They want a sauce he has created for one dish applied to another, for 
instance, or they ask to shuffle accompaniments around, as if every single item 
mentioned were a la carte, and it were each client's responsibility to arrange 
them so that they made sense. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Healy is well-known in the local restaurant community as a pleasant and 
reasonable young man. He is not at all, in other words, one of those 
egos-at-high-boil that run some kitchens hereabouts. And indeed, he is quick to 
stress, he accommodates his customers whenever possible. "But I think people 
should realize," he says, "that wanting to change everything around is 
something that has always killed chefs who spend a long time working on their 
menus, trying to match sauces, vegetables, and so on. I'll always serve a sauce 
on the side or hold it altogether, but we get some very strange requests 
sometimes, like people wanting a sauce for meat put on their fish. I can't 
change things around for everybody, because once I start, I'd never be able to 
stop." There are three big problems here, Healy admits: "My professional pride, 
my sense of judgement about food and just plain time." 
</P>
<P>
Having noted Healy's plaint, I'd be interested to hear more opinions on the 
subject -- from chefs and customers alike. 
</P>
<P>
CHECKERS MATE: Elka Gilmore, former chef at Camelions in Santa Monica and 
chef/proprietor of the now-defunct Tumbleweed in Beverly Hills, has been named 
executive chef at the Ayala Hotel group's new Checkers, a luxury hostelry due 
to open in March, downtown, on Grand Avenue between 5th and 6th streets (on the 
site of the old Mayflower Hotel). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Ayala's flagship property, Campton Place in San Francisco, Jan 
Birnbaum moves into the executive chef's office -- replacing Bradley Ogden, who 
is leaving to open his own restaurant. Birnbaum, who has been working under 
Ogden, is a veteran of three of the country's best restaurants -- the 
Rattlesnake Club in Denver, the Quilted Giraffe in New York, and Paul 
Prudhomme's K-Paul's in New Orleans. Birnbaum takes over officially on February 
15, though Ayala president Bill Wilkinson adds, "We expect that Bradley will be 
around helping us here and there throughout the end of March." 
</P>
<P>
EAST MEETS WEST: Speaking of chefs who have moved, our own Roy Yamaguchi, 
formerly of 385 North, will open his new restaurant, Roy's, on Jan. 28 in 
Honolulu. Local talent is also responsible for the look: the L.A. firm 
Grinstein-Daniels (designers of Chaya Brasserie) designed the new restaurant. 
Says Yamaguchi, who is known for his combinations of Asian and European 
cooking: "The Islands are where East meets West. I think we were made for each 
other." 
</P>

Thanks for finally including one of my productions in Pop Eye's Bottom 10 list 
("The Worst of 1988," by Patrick Goldstein, Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
After so many years of having one popular group after another receive a 
critical bashing from The Times, only to miss the Worst 10 list, I finally made 
it with Poison. Guess this goes to show that four Top 10 singles and 5 million 
copies sold won't hurt an album's chances of earning a spot on your list. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next year Poison will be lucky enough to come in higher than No. 9: A 
spot in the list's Worst-5 might mean sales of 10 million!

It will be a dark day for the music business if Tracy Chapman's male-bashing 
anthem "Fast Car" is awarded even one Grammy ("Tracy Chapman: The Grammy 
Favorite," Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: If Bob Dylan wrote a song about quitting school to take care of 
his troubled mother but then abandoning her, getting married but later taking 
the children and abandoning his troubled wife, people would think he was a 
monster. But when Chapman sings of abandoning troubled men, she is roundly 
applauded. Is there a double standard at work here? 
</P>
<P>
And after seeing the video for this song, it is obvious to me that Chapman, for 
crass commercial gain, is exploiting a racist stereotype of black men as lazy 
people and lousy fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast Car" is designed to portray the singer as a victim. But an inspection of 
the lyrics reveals that the woman in the song is calling all the shots. She is 
not a victim but a victimizer. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose that we shouldn't blame Chapman. We all live in a society where 
male-bashing is used to sell everything from cigarettes to automobiles. Why 
shouldn't she get to join the party?

Shame. I've seen films ruined before by studio executives, but Universal 
Studios' televised version of "Brazil" takes the cake (Outtakes item, by Steven 
Smith, Jan. 8)!

<P>
It is ironic that film maker Terry Gilliam, whose chief idea was to warn us of 
"the system," should lose out in the end to the Big Brother of Universal. 
</P>
<P>
But the real losers are those who see this movie for the first time and think 
this version -- which has undergone changes in editing, the musical score, 
dialogue and the ending -- is the real thing.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CABLE TV DEALS: THERE'S LOGIC IN THE HIGH PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entrepreneur and Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke and the New York 
Times Co. sold their cable television interests last week. 
</P>
<P>
And both received handsome prices, confirming that demand for cable TV systems 
remains strong in contrast to the market for local television stations -- where 
Channels magazine reports a glut of unsold properties because business has been 
poor. Cable's optimism contrasts also with continuing gloom at the TV networks, 
ABC, CBS and NBC, which only 10 years ago held 90% of the national audience but 
now have 68%. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke Cablevision fetched an estimated $1.5 billion last week, or roughly 
$2,150 for each of its 700,000 subscribers. That means if you pay about $20 a 
month to subscribe to cable -- as 53% of TV households now do -- smart business 
people are willing to pay $2,000 to reach you. 
</P>
<P>
Or more. The New York Times cable system, which serves affluent communities in 
southern New Jersey, went for the equivalent of $3,000 per customer -- or 
almost three times what the newspaper paid to buy the system in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
What's up with cable? More customers, higher subscriber payments and 
advertising revenue. Cable systems took in over $1 billion in advertising last 
year -- a small percentage of television's $25 billion in ad dollars but double 
cable's ad totals five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Which made a lot of people sit up and take notice. Deals in communications -- a 
vast industry with newspapers, radio, television, books, magazines and movies 
competing for the customer's time -- arouse interest beyond the buyers and 
sellers. Advertisers are looking for ways to reach customers, politicians 
monitor anything that reaches voters, and regulators are watchful because 
communications involves public policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Industry 
</P>
<P>
And people pay attention because media deals both reflect what the public 
watches and predict what it will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
So what do high cable prices say? That the business is still growing. "In a few 
years, 70% of the 90 million TV households will have cable," says analyst 
Kenneth Berents of the Philadelphia brokerage house Butcher &amp; Singer. 
</P>
<P>
It has grown from a service for homes with poor TV signals to a significant and 
permanent part of television. NBC is starting an all-news cable service to 
compete with Cable News Network. ABC owns ESPN, which showed NFL football last 
season and will soon have major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
So why did Cooke and the New York Times sell? And were buyers, including 
Denver's Tele-Communications Inc. -- the largest cable operator -- wise to buy 
at this time? 
</P>
<P>
The stock market seems disapproving. Although Tele-Communications' President 
John Malone paid $2,100 a subscriber for some of Cooke's cable systems, the 
stock market values Malone's own company at about $1,200 a subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is in perspective: The market is looking at near-term revenues 
while Malone understands that the business has reached a turning point. Cable 
operators, having wired more than half the nation's TV households, now must 
invest in programming and build bigger systems to use such programs 
economically. Malone's TCI owns local sports channels in Pittsburgh and Denver 
and plans more in Western states; cable pioneer Ted Turner has just launched a 
national movie channel. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies will decide either to commit sizable resources to cable or to 
cash out, as New York Times and Cooke did last week. 
</P>
<P>
Will cable displace free, broadcast television? Not at all. Cable represents an 
addition to a U.S. system that has stressed choice and variety since the 
Federal Communications Act of 1934 made service to local communities the 
guiding principle of industry. Politically, it was a case of Congress making 
sure of access to constituents. But economically it has resulted in an enormous 
and varied market of 1300 television stations, and now more than 7,000 cable 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
It's a system being copied worldwide: France and Italy now allow non-government 
channels; Britain soon will get the kind of multi-station variety Americans 
take for granted. And it's a system that, as cable prices show, builds values 
in more ways than one.

ON THE FARM: TIME OF HOPE, ALIENATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farming never lacks for challenges, and 1989 may bring a bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
The year was ushered in, after all, by a fresh trade flap with Europe over 
hormone-treated cattle and a continuing drought now threatening the Midwest's 
winter wheat crop. Yet to come are the crafting of a new federal budget that 
will only mean less money for agriculture and the opening debates on a 1990 
farm bill that may phase out crop subsidies altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the mood was distinctly upbeat last week as 6,000 members of 
the nation's largest organization of family-owned ranches and farms gathered in 
San Antonio for the 70th annual meeting of the 3.7 million-member American Farm 
Bureau Federation. "The mood is as good as I've seen it in many years," said 
the federation's president, Dean R. Kleckner, who raises hogs, corn and 
soybeans in Rudd, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Kleckner added, farmers do have many reasons for concern. And many of 
these arise from what appears to be an increasing alienation of the nation's 
urban majority from the farmers who feed it. For most city dwellers, he said, 
agriculture today is an invisible industry that goes largely uncredited by 
consumers for the low-cost and high-quality food it produces. 
</P>
<P>
This feeling of alienation formed an undercurrent during many of the farmers' 
talks and panel discussions. The first troubling note was sounded even as they 
checked into their hotels. Moreover, it came from a surprising quarter -- 
Texas' highest-ranking farm official, Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters to comment on the European Community's extension Jan. 1 of 
its year-old domestic ban of hormone-treated beef to U.S. producers, the 
commissioner seemed to applaud the Europeans' stance. Hightower, who cultivates 
a populist image and was reelected to a second term two years ago from a 
largely urban power base, said the European ban was not the work of "a group of 
hippies" but rather reflects "a clear trend among consumers who are concerned 
about food." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Hightower further charged that U.S. negotiators were denying access 
to the European market to many producers who don't use hormones in finishing 
cattle for market to protect three firms he said control 70% of processed U.S. 
beef and are "the chief users of anabolic steroids" -- Iowa Beef Processors, a 
subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, ConAgra and Excel, a unit of Cargill. 
</P>
<P>
"Our farmers," he said, "should not be put in the position of stating, 'Eat 
your hormones.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Consumer Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Hightower's remarks drew sharp criticism from the Texas Farm Bureau but were 
welcomed by agricultural attaches from European Community countries who were 
observing the gathering. While acknowledging the U.S. point that no scientific 
evidence has shown that the federally approved growth hormones pose a health 
threat, the Europeans called that point irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"The ban is a response to consumer pressure in the European Community," said 
Brian J. Harding of Britain, who predicted that similar anti-hormone pressures 
will soon build in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Legislation isn't always based on good scientific evidence," observed 
Harding's Danish counterpart, Ludvig Madsen. "But the Americans have to learn 
that when you export, you have to produce what the customer wants." 
</P>
<P>
The trade flap so far has triggered retaliatory tariffs by the United States on 
seven European products, including canned tomatoes, fruit juice and instant 
coffee, and authorization for the European Community to reciprocate against 
U.S.-produced nuts and dried fruits (both mostly from California). But for the 
moment the matter is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious trade ramifications, the ban has a broader and, for 
farmers, more worrisome aspect -- fear of biotechnology itself. In California, 
for example, attempts in the past few years to use biotechnology to increase 
the frost resistance of potatoes and strawberries generated emotional protests 
when the plants were moved from the laboratory outdoors for field tests. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, to farm experts, biotechnology must play a major role in future farming. 
</P>
<P>
"The public must be helped to understand that scientists use biotechnology to 
do such things as create insect- and disease-free foods -- not laboratory 
monsters," Kleckner told farmers in his annual address. "Japan, Germany and 
Great Britain have made tremendous commitments to full use of biotechnology. We 
must do as much or more than other nations if we are to remain competitive in 
world markets, or we'll get left in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Biotechnology, which can produce freeze-resistant plants, might also be able to 
mitigate the future disastrous effects of a drought such as that now entering 
its third year in much of the Grain Belt and threatening the normally hardy 
winter wheat crop. But popular fears of biotechnology also seem to extend to 
concern for the safety and purity of the nation's food supply -- from both 
additives injected during processing and residues left on produce from farm 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the public's concern over pesticide residues is perceived or real, the 
fact that they feel the way they do means we have a problem," said Fred Shank, 
acting Federal Drug Administration director for food safety and nutrition. "Our 
tests show that actual residue levels represent a fraction of 1% of the average 
daily intake allowed. We're talking about mighty small quantities." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiasco in San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Shank acknowledged, public opinion surveys still show that 75% of 
consumers view residues as a serious food hazard. Some retailers, especially in 
California, are attempting to capitalize on that concern by hiring additional 
testing services, supposedly to validate the safety of what they sell. 
</P>
<P>
Kleckner himself was forced to take a strong stand against what the farm 
federation viewed as a hostile act last month, when the San Francisco Board of 
Supervisors voted to support a controversial boycott of California table grapes 
sponsored by Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers, which alleges that field 
workers are being harmed by chemicals used in San Joaquin Valley vineyards. The 
federation yanked its 1991 convention from San Francisco, repeating a pullout 
in 1982 to protest support of a similar boycott of table grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"When will those people learn?" Kleckner exclaimed in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
But Chavez's boycott, regardless of the merit of the union's health claims and 
industry denials, enjoys broad credibility nonetheless among many consumers as 
demonstrated most sweepingly in 1986 by the overwhelming passage of Proposition 
65, an initiative that, among other things, greatly increased state regulation 
of toxic chemicals, including pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Further evidence of urban alienation surfaced in Massachusetts last year in the 
form of a so-called animal-rights referendum on the November ballot. Although 
the referendum won just 29% of the state vote, similar "animal rights" measures 
are expected to crop up elsewhere. In California, for example, legislation was 
introduced last year to set minimum space requirements for veal calves, though 
it failed to get out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Kika de la Garza (D-Texas), head of the House Committee on Agriculture, 
also expressed concern for urban alienation from agriculture. "We're getting 
away from the land," De la Garza told the farmers. "There are people out there 
who think milk comes out of a carton and peas out of cans." 
</P>
<P>
Such ignorance, he said, makes urban voters vulnerable to political 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Farm Funds Decline 
</P>
<P>
"We need a greater focus on public awareness of the importance of agriculture 
and the needs of agriculture, and how we can interweave farming and urban 
living," said Henry J. Voss, president of the California Farm Bureau 
Federation. This might be done, he said, by programs emphasizing the safety and 
purity of produce. "We need to do more of that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Popular perceptions also tend to work against agriculture, De la Garza said, in 
the funding of farm programs -- a $52.1-billion expenditure this year. About 
$14 billion went to farmers to compensate for low prices prevailing for the 
basic commodities covered by program, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice and 
soybeans. And President Reagan's proposed budget would lower that to $11.6 
billion. Still, De la Garza said, the perception remains that the farm program 
is inordinately costly. 
</P>
<P>
"They stumble over more money in one day in the Pentagon than we spend in a 
year on agriculture," said De la Garza. 
</P>
<P>
Americans devote only 11% of their disposable income to food, he added, and 
farmers get just 25 cents of the retail food dollar. Then, to the enthusiastic 
applause of the thousands of farm families present, De la Garza hammered home 
his point: "So if there is a subsidy, it is to the consumer, and it comes off 
the back of the farmer!"

WALL STREET: DREXEL'S CASINO WORK MAY GO BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Crudele, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist with New York magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After it agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts a few weeks ago, Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. was suspended from selling New York City municipal bonds. 
Now it looks as though the embattled investment firm is having trouble in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Jersey gambling regulators say Drexel could soon be barred by 
the New Jersey Casino Control Commission from doing business with casinos there 
because of its agreement to pay $650 million in penalties for securities law 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a headache for Drexel and a continuation of the slow 
deterioration of its business, such a move could also be a major blow to Bally 
Manufacturing, which owns two casinos in Atlantic City. Drexel Burnham has been 
spearheading a restructuring effort for Bally. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the licensing process is meeting the statutory criteria," says a 
source close to the regulators. Under state law, almost all felons are 
automatically kept out of the casino business, and companies -- like Drexel -- 
that serve the casino industry may also be barred if convicted of a felony. 
"You can form your own opinion," the source said when asked if Drexel would be 
barred. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state law, a felon could be allowed to take part in the gaming 
business in a service capacity if he -- or it -- has shown signs of 
rehabilitation. While such a loophole might help Drexel down the road, right 
now it is unlikely that the investment house can prove that it has changed that 
much in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hard and fast rule," said another source close to the casino 
commission. "But if you are talking about Drexel, it will probably be 
impossible for them to do business here." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has done so much business with the casinos in New Jersey that regulators 
early last year asked the company to file for a license as a service industry. 
This license is now pending. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said: "Our guys are looking at that (the New 
Jersey situation) now." Will Drexel be allowed to do business with the casinos? 
"I hope so," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Bally, meanwhile, finds itself in a precarious situation. The 
company announced months ago that it wanted to split itself into two parts. One 
part would be a gaming and hotel business. The other would include health 
clubs, amusement center products and its lottery equipment operations. 
</P>
<P>
The casino part of the company, however, would end up with much more debt than 
it now has. Regulators generally don't like casinos to be highly leveraged, so 
experts on Wall Street believe that the plan is destined to fail even without 
the added burden of Drexel's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
But even before Bally can submit its restructuring plan, the company has to 
find out whether Drexel Burnham Lambert will be able to continue to work on the 
transaction. The other investment firm on the deal, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., is 
too small to carry the load all by itself. Sources speculate that only one or 
two other firms -- Merrill Lynch and perhaps Shearson Lehman Hutton -- would be 
capable of replacing Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Bally is supposed to file the restructuring plan with New Jersey regulators 
next month. "I don't know if they want to come in here right now," says a 
casino source. Other sources say Bally has already received inklings that the 
commission isn't keen on its restructuring idea. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports around Wall Street last week that Bally Chairman Robert E. 
Mullane was scouring the financial community for another investment banker to 
replace Drexel. If Mullane can't salvage his current restructuring plan, there 
is speculation that he might attempt to take the company private. As previously 
reported, an investor group has already expressed an interest in buying Bally. 
</P>
<P>
A Bally spokesman would only say that Drexel is still its investment counselor. 
</P>
<P>
About this time last year, famed climatologist Iben Browning of Sandia Park, 
N.M., predicted that the United States would be sweating its way through a 
drought in the summer of '88. He was, of course, right. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Browning think about next summer? He's predicting a "more moderate 
summer (that) will return toward normal in both rainfall and temperature." 
</P>
<P>
And there is more good news for consumers. Browning, who also acts as a 
consultant for the Paine Webber brokerage, says the acreage that will be 
planted with corn this year will increase by one-third. That's mostly because 
of changes in the government subsidy program. 
</P>
<P>
But if Browning's prediction about the weather holds up, that will mean that 
the country will be rolling in the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Last year about 40% of the corn and soybean crop was lost during the drought. 
Between 10% and 15% of the spring wheat crop was also destroyed. 
</P>

Browning based last year's accurate prediction on the extraordinarily high 
number of tornadoes along the Gulf Coast. There were more tornadoes than 
normal, Browning claimed, because the jet stream -- the same weather pattern 
that brings rain over farmland in the High Plains during summer -- was 
misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
But the jet stream appears to be right where it belongs this year, says 
Browning, who counted hardly a Gulf Coast tornado all fall.

If soon-to-be-President Bush wants to raise revenues while also fighting some 
American vices, Merrill Lynch suggests an increase in the tax on cigarettes, 
wine, hard liquor and beer. And, to keep some of the imbibers off the road, 
throw an additional tax on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets estimates that a 25-cents-a-gallon tax on 
gasoline would generate $25 billion a year in revenue. And, even better, the 
price of a gasoline wouldn't be any higher than it was at the height of OPEC's 
power. 
</P>
<P>
So-called sin taxes -- on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes -- would bring in 
another $10 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch says none of these taxes have been raised more than once in the 
past 35 years. It says these taxes are lower today -- when inflation is taken 
into account -- than they were in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the additional taxes can easily be justified. The higher levy on 
fuel can be presented as a revenue raiser for pollution control or highway 
maintenance, and the booze tax can be bottled as a way to raise money to fight 
substance abuse. 
</P>

Fees and commissions paid by industrial corporations to investment bankers rose 
16% in 1988, according to Greenwich (Conn.) Associates. Smaller companies saw 
the biggest increase. Forty percent of the money went for merger and 
acquisition activity . . .

Cummins Engine stock has been rising on takeover rumors ever since Sir Gordon 
White, head of Hanson Industries, announced a few weeks ago that he owned lots 
of its stock. But sources close to Sir Gordon insist that the British 
investor/raider has no intention of taking over Cummins on either a friendly or 
unfriendly basis. "It's just an investment," the source repeated several times 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Corporate takeover activity has slowed considerably over the past few months, 
according to investment banking sources, but not because people don't want to 
do deals. The sources say companies and raiders are holding back so as not to 
create a furor in Congress at the start of the Bush Administration . . .

A Transco Energy Co. executive has told Wall Street that the company may settle 
a lawsuit concerning natural gas contracts before the end of this month. It 
would result in a writedown, the size of which he did not disclose . . .

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: R&amp;D AND CHANGING U.S. PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Murray Weidenbaum 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With this column, Murray Weidenbaum rejoins the Times Board of Economists after 
an eight-year absence that began with his appointment by President Reagan to 
chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Weidenbaum, an economist who received 
his doctorate from Princeton University, served on the council in 1981-82 
before returning to Washington University in St. Louis, where he is director of 
the Center for the Study of American Business. This academic year, he is on 
leave while serving as distinguished scholar at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington. He is the author of numerous articles and 
books, the latest of which is "Rendezvous With Reality: The American Economy 
After Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
In this period of necessary concentration on reducing federal deficit spending, 
there is great danger that, inadvertently, support for science and technology 
will be downgraded. Scientific research and technological development make 
vital contributions to economic progress, national security, international 
commerce and other key aspects of national life -- including the ability to 
bear the burdens of a large national security establishment. However, little 
attention is being given to these linkages in the current public debate on the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Public and private decision makers rarely make conscious decisions to finance 
research and development, aside from comparatively modest support of basic 
research. In the case of the public sector -- which sponsors and pays for half 
of all the R&amp;D performed in this country -- most R&amp;D support results 
from spending money on specific program areas. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the really large governmental outlays for science and technology flow 
from decisions to strengthen the national defense, to promote energy 
independence, to seek cures for diseases and to explore outer space. The entire 
budget of the National Science Foundation -- the one agency devoted to 
promoting research and development per se -- is less than 3% of total federal 
outlays for R&amp;D. 
</P>
<P>
The R&amp;D intensity of individual federal agencies varies greatly. NASA 
devotes more than 45% of its budget to research and development, while the 
ratio is less than 1% in the case of the Veterans Administration. Over 42% of 
the Energy Department's budget is allocated to R&amp;D; less than 2% is 
budgeted for R&amp;D at the Agriculture Department. The implications of these 
differences are profound. 
</P>
<P>
A shift in budgetary priorities from NASA to Agriculture or from Energy to the 
VA represents a de facto (though unintended) commitment for the federal 
government to spend less on R&amp;D and more on other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Two inconsistent trends are now in evidence. First, the United States is 
increasingly reliant on the fruits of scientific and technological activity to 
maintain its basic strength. We attain our military strength not by having the 
largest army or navy or air force. Rather, we rely on the most technically 
sophisticated and up-to-date arsenal of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, high-tech companies experience a favorable balance of trade, while 
low-tech companies have suffered most severely from foreign competition. 
R&amp;D-intensive industries experience greater increases in productivity than 
the less R&amp;D-intensive ones. Clearly, outlays for science and technology 
are a key to the continuation of this country's military and economic power. 
</P>
<P>
However, the second trend is adverse to this relationship. Most of the 
R&amp;D-oriented departments and agencies of the federal government are 
experiencing substantial budget squeezes, notably Defense, Energy and NASA. 
Simultaneously, the "entitlements" (ranging from Social Security payments to 
farm subsidies to veterans' pensions) are continuing to grow rapidly. These 
latter agencies devote insignificant portions of their resources to R&amp;D. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we are now witnessing a slowdown in private outlays for the 
support of R&amp;D. Hostile takeovers are resulting in many companies cutting 
back discretionary expenditures, no matter how valuable, in order to maximize 
short-term cash flow. Moreover, companies that have taken on staggering debt 
loads -- either as part of a change in corporate control or to head it off -- 
often are forced to cut back outlays that do not generate an immediate return 
on the investment. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is a complex set of relationships between public 
sector-financed R&amp;D and that sponsored by the private sector. Major defense 
contractors both perform R&amp;D under government contracts and sponsor their 
own research and development, a portion of which may be charged to the 
government as overhead on defense procurement contracts. At a time when the 
entire military budget is under pressure, there is a natural tendency for the 
Department of Defense to cut back on the company-initiated R&amp;D that will be 
reimbursed as overhead on government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
This reduction in "independent" R&amp;D reimbursements is likely to force 
high-tech companies to avoid new high-risk ventures. They will increasingly 
focus their funds on more modest extensions of current product lines. Such a 
strategy may be safe for an individual company, but it reduces the 
effectiveness of the total U.S. effort on R&amp;D. 
</P>
<P>
Many nations with which the United States competes have been devoting rising 
shares of their gross national product to research and development. Moreover, 
far larger proportions are assigned to commercial projects than is the case in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Setting national policy on research and development is especially difficult 
because so many seemingly unrelated factors are involved. A rise in corporate 
takeovers or a bailout of insolvent thrift institutions -- by squeezing budgets 
for other purposes -- can exert far more influence on the availability of funds 
for R&amp;D than an enhanced budget for the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
What can and should be done? Decision makers, in both the public and private 
sectors, need to focus more directly on the important role of R&amp;D in making 
their plans and voting on budgets for what they consider to be broader 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, senior officials involved in economic and budgetary 
decision-making rarely have adequate understanding of the substantive issues 
involved in determining the amount and allocation of funds for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
In some past presidential administrations, a science adviser was appointed who 
also served, at least informally, as representative of the science community. 
At times, the adviser became a public spokesman for the administration in 
office, but that is not the basic function of the position. The fundamental 
point is that decision-making on key national issues should be more fully 
informed of their scientific and technological aspects. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, we should not neglect the one-half of R&amp;D sponsored and 
paid for by the private sector. It is not a lack of government money but rather 
a traditional attitude that forces American companies to assign less of their 
engineering talent to production than do the Japanese. By devoting more of 
their professional work force to detailed product design and quality control, 
Japanese firms often enjoy quicker responsiveness to market opportunities, 
lower costs, and better quality output. 
</P>
<P>
Some American scientific leaders contend that the striking competitiveness of 
Japanese industry is due not so much to the magnitude of the R&amp;D resources 
that are available to them but to their more effective use by the private 
sector. Thus, much of the time, the line between high-powered research 
laboratories and enhanced competitiveness may not go through Washington at all 
-- but through the corporate offices of American industry.

CRITICS SAY GM'S REQUEST FOR A REBATE PROVES AUTO GIANT OVERVALUED HUGHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Did General Motors pay too much for Hughes Aircraft in 1985? 
</P>
<P>
It is a question that some GM critics are asking more frequently since the 
recent disclosure that GM is seeking a rebate of $200 million on the Hughes 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
The company wants the $5.2-billion price reduced because of an estimated 
$200-million penalty that Hughes absorbed on a Navy contract that it failed to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
H. Ross Perot, the former maverick GM director who cast the lone dissenting 
vote against the Hughes acquisition, said in a recent interview that Hughes was 
worth no more than $3 billion to $3.5 billion. He insisted that the GM effort 
to obtain a rebate shows that he was right in saying that Hughes was 
overvalued. "I said, 'What does Hughes have that we are going to put on a car?' 
" Perot recalled. "And they said, 'The window displays that you have on 
fighters.' I said, 'Are you sure anybody wants that?' " 
</P>
<P>
When GM bought Hughes, it did not expect to recover its investment through 
Hughes profits. 
</P>
<P>
In a July 16, 1985, letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM 
Executive Vice President F. Alan Smith wrote: "There is little expectation that 
a significant portion of GM's investment in Hughes in excess of the underlying 
net book value will be recovered through future Hughes operations nor was that 
the intent in acquiring Hughes." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, GM wanted Hughes' technology, believing that it would "make GM's 
automotive manufacturing operations and products more efficient and more 
competitive and carry GM into the 21st Century," Smith wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has started 140 engineering projects to help transfer its technology to 
GM, Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie said in an interview. Hughes has sold $30 
million worth of its technology and products to GM in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not the Only Critic 
</P>
<P>
"The automotive electronics market is growing quite rapidly," Currie said. 
"It's one of the big opportunities in the electronics industry today. So I'm 
hoping we can get some real synergy there." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the rationale is faulted by critics like Perot, who said GM did 
not have to spend $5.2 billion to get the technology. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I am the only person on the board with an advanced technology 
background. Tell me what technology you want and set aside $100 million. I will 
get you that technology and bring you change," he said. "I will do it on the 
following premise: You don't have to own the dairy to get milk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perot is not the only critic. Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca wrote recently 
in Fortune magazine: "The decision to pay $5.2 billion for Hughes Aircraft in 
1985 was crazy. GM will never get a worthwhile return on that."

TEACHERS' PAY

In his letter published Jan. 1 in The Times, ("Blaming the Los Angeles School 
Board for the Labor Woes of Teachers is Unfair") Leonard M. Britton, 
superintendent of schools for Los Angeles, portrays Los Angeles teachers' 
salaries as comparing favorably to those of teachers in Dade County, Fla., 
where he previously was superintendent. Unfortunately, he neglected to mention 
the much greater cost of living in Los Angeles. Houses, for example, are much 
more expensive in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Britton hasn't come face to face with this economic dilemma as his 
$141,000 salary quite likely has shielded him from it.

READING LABELS CAN OPEN YOUR EYES, SHUT YOUR MOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

Consumers will benefit in the long run from food manufacturers' efforts to make 
and promote healthier processed food, says Molly Gee, chief dietitian at 
Houston's Institute for Preventive Medicine at the Methodist Hospital. Still, 
she advises consumers to look beyond the promotions and read labels carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn., and other health experts 
also caution consumers to view food ingredients in the context of their total 
dietary goals and in the context of their life style. A person who eats mostly 
home-cooked, balanced meals made from unprocessed foods, Gee says, probably 
shouldn't be too concerned about a little tropical oil in an occasional snack. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration requires food processors to list ingredients 
and the amount of sodium on the label, but they do not have to list nutritional 
information unless they have added a nutrient to the food or are making a 
nutritional claim about the product. For example, milk cartons carry a complete 
label because Vitamins A &amp; D are added nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, many processors voluntarily provide complete nutritional 
information, resulting in about 55% of packaged foods with comprehensive 
labels, according to FDA surveys. Manufacturers may provide general 
descriptions of colorings and flavorings, but yellow dye No. 5 must be listed 
specifically to warn people with allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive label consists of three basic parts: 
</P>
<P>
* The amount of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates and sodium per serving. 
</P>
<P>
* The percentage of the recommended daily allowance of certain nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
* The ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredient that represents the most weight in the package would must be 
listed first, with other ingredients following in descending order. For 
example, if there are 8 ounces of beans in a 12-ounce can, beans would be 
listed first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Guidelines in Mind 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is considering regulations that would more specifically define what 
manufacturers can say about cholesterol on the label. If approved, food 
processors would be able to say a product is cholesterol-free if there is less 
than 2 milligrams of cholesterol in each serving, or describe the product as 
low cholesterol if each serving has less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
A reduced cholesterol statement would mean that the cholesterol normally in 
such a product has been reduced by at least 75%, according to the FDA proposal. 
Manufacturers who make statements about cholesterol on the label would also be 
required to list whether the fat is polyunsaturated or saturated. 
</P>
<P>
Gee says that in looking at labels, consumers should keep in mind dietary 
guidelines, such as the American Heart Assn. recommendations on sodium, 
cholesterol and fat. Cholesterol consumption should be limited to less than 300 
milligrams a day, and daily fat intake should be less than 30% of total 
calories, according to those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines allow for a broader range of sodium -- 2,000 to 5,000 milligrams 
per day -- with people with hypertension or other health problems advised to 
stick closer to the lower end of the range. (The average American intake is 
about 7,000 milligrams.) 
</P>
<P>
It is important to consider not only total calories, but the distribution of 
total calories in the food, Gee says, because the healthiest diet has a calorie 
distribution that is predominantly protein and complex carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
Also, nutritionists say it is harder to lose weight if too many of the calories 
are from fat. Each gram of fat equals 9 calories and each gram of carbohydrates 
and protein equals 4 calories, Gee says. To determine the percentage of total 
calories that is fat, multiply the number of grams by 9 and divide the result 
by the total number of calories in the dish. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the popular low-calorie prepared meals vary widely in how the calories 
are distributed among protein, carbohydrates and fat. For example, Weight 
Watchers' 370-calorie Cheese Enchiladas Ranchero dinner has 22 grams of fat. 
Thus, 53% of the calories come from fat, 18% from protein and 28% from 
carbohydrates. The fat content is far above the recommended guideline for one 
meal, Gee says. 
</P>
<P>
The 220 calories in the Le Menu Light Style Herb Roasted Chicken dinner is made 
up of 24% fat (6 grams), and 38% each (21 grams) protein and carbohydrates. A 
way to visualize how much fat is consumed, Gee said, is to convert grams to 
teaspoons. 
</P>
<P>
Five grams of fat is equal to a teaspoon of oil, she says. Thus the fat in that 
particular Weight Watchers dinner is like downing nearly 4 1/2 teaspoons of 
oil.

A WORLD NEWSPAPER FALLS ON PAROCHIAL BOTTOM-LINES 
</P>

Press and the author of Seeds (Woodbridge Press).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty years ago the Christian Science Monitor began its remarkable publishing 
history. Born during the heyday of yellow journalism, the Monitor was heralded 
for being objective and fair and non-parochial, from its first issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor was a gift from the Christian Science Church to the whole globe. It 
was one of the first newspapers published in the United States to carry news 
from around the world, and eventually gained widespread respect for its 
coverage of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
People of all faiths learned to respect its objectivity, and embassies 
worldwide found its coverage of sensitive events to be accurate, analytical and 
fair to all sides. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor has won its share of prizes over eight decades, including several 
Pulitzers, and I'm grateful that several of the prizes and citations I received 
in 14 years there as education editor are still on display in the church's 
publishing house in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who do not already know, the Monitor has trimmed its sails. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Katherine Fanning, editor of the Monitor, and her two assistant 
managing editors resigned in a dispute with the church's five-person Board of 
Directors over the issue of editorial control. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3, a truncated version of the Monitor appeared, carrying no breaking 
news, no home and family news, no investigative stories, no sports. The new 
Monitor offered full color, in contrast to the old black-and-white pages, plus 
pie charts and capsulated features. 
</P>
<P>
The drastic change in one of the world's most highly respected newspapers has 
brought on a firestorm of protest, both inside and outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
A brief explanation is necessary here of what it means to be a Christian 
Scientist, and how Boston's First Church of Christ, Scientist, is administered. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to be a Christian Scientist. That's been true for a century, 
since the church's founding by the still-controversial and often misunderstood 
Mary Baker Eddy. Turn-of-the-century Christian Scientists suffered public 
ridicule, with Mark Twain leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Few would quarrel with the sense of hope inherent in a key statement from 
Eddy's textbook ("Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures"): "Divine Love 
always has met and always will meet every human need." 
</P>
<P>
For a member of the church, this means eschewing medical solutions, embracing 
prayer and spiritual healing whenever the student of Christian Science feels 
strong and firm enough to do so. 
</P>
<P>
This brings each Christian Scientist to a life of compromise -- between a trust 
in God, and the need to live, work and play in a material, not spiritual, 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor has been at the forefront of the church's teaching these 80 years 
-- that is, in the marketplace putting the laser beam of "Divine Love" on 
"human needs" throughout the world. But now the beam has been diminished and 
diffused. 
</P>
<P>
As the head of the Monitor's Washington bureau, Charlotte Saikowski, wrote 
Fanning's replacement, Richard J. Cattani, on Jan. 3: "You should know that 
reactions in the Washington community to events at the Monitor have been 
heart-rending. I have heard expressions of concern from members of Congress, 
White House, State Department; foreign diplomats; academics; leading 
representatives of the print and television industry, and many other readers." 
</P>
<P>
There have always been those extremely critical of the Monitor, particularly 
from politically ultraconservative members of the church. The current five 
directors of the church, and the three former directors who are now the 
part-time trustees of the church's publishing society, belong in that critical 
group. 
</P>
<P>
I posit that these eight church officers, concerned about lawsuits challenging 
the right of members to turn wholly to prayer for healing their children, 
worried about declining membership in adult church ranks and shrinking Sunday 
school enrollments, not only did not know of the Monitor's influence among 
decision-makers around the world, but have never themselves read and loved the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
These eight church officials are bureaucrats -- the membership does not vote 
directors or trustees into or out of office; they are self-perpetuating. In the 
Christian Science Church, which has no priesthood nor clergy, these few 
officials, along with a clerk and a treasurer, are the top decision-makers 
regarding the business of the church. 
</P>
<P>
And the Christian Science Monitor is church business. It's been a remarkable 
history. Monitor reporters and editors have always been "different" from the 
usual church workers. Away from the sheltering walls of the Mother Church, the 
Monitor staffers investigated child prostitution rings in South America, the 
fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States, reforms in the Soviet 
Union, the tangled politics in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
When the current manager of the church's publishing society drew up a plan to 
shrink, if not eliminate, the daily paper in favor of a multimillion dollar 
evening television news program and a slick monthly magazine, the directors not 
only went along, but were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
Church directors and trustees were impressed by the manager's arithmetic. If a 
publication that incurs a $20 million annual deficit -- alleged to be the 
Monitor's shortfall -- is serving only 160,000 subscribers (ignoring its 
multiple usage in libraries around the world), and $40 million or $50 million 
can reach as many as 8 million television viewers via cable TV, then the move 
to television news serves two purposes: a) less cost per person and b) more 
persons in all. 
</P>
<P>
The directors and trustees are wrong to truncate the Monitor. I think they are 
foolish to have distrusted it, and even more foolish not to have understood its 
importance to the church as a gift to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of the publishing house is replacing church mission with dubious 
bottom-line reasoning. The audience that used and counted on the Monitor for 
eight decades will sorely miss its top-quality journalism -- its breadth, depth 
and special perspective on world events. 
</P>
<P>
What will faithful Christian Scientists do about all this? They will, as they 
have for a century, pray; they know, and have long-since proved, that prayer 
heals.

WELCOMING IMMIGRANTS AND ENTERTAINING ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Mahony, Roger Mahony is the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles. This article is adapted from his message celebrating National 
Migration Week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Immigration is a big story unfolding in the neighborhoods and parishes of our 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles: It changes the face of the country and speaks of 
the vitality of American society. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, the experience of our history and the conclusion of experts find 
that a positive contribution is made by immigrants even today. Uneasiness, 
however, surfaces on occasion perhaps due to fear of unknown cultural groups, 
and of the possibility that asylum seekers, refugees and the poor may limit our 
comfort and remind us that we are not alone in an increasingly interdependent 
world. 
</P>
<P>
In the public-policy debate, specific signs of anxiety are frequently headlined 
in the media and a concern emerges which calls for a thoughtful and cooperative 
search for fair solutions to a number of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Large numbers of individuals and families are without documents for legal 
residence in this country. Pushed out of their countries by violence and 
hunger, they are unable to return home and yet have not benefitted from 
legalization provisions of the immigration law. More vulnerable than ever, this 
subclass of the poor cannot be written off without serious social and moral 
costs to their -- and our -- human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Surveys of implementation of current immigration laws find widespread 
discrimination against legalized aliens and American citizens who appear 
foreign, a situation worsened by lack of information on the exact provisions of 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Undercurrents of ethnic and religious prejudice exist in the push for 
"English only" as the official language for public services and programs. Yet 
our experience in the archdiocese shows that hundreds of thousands of newcomers 
are most anxious to learn English. They come to classes day and night in our 
parishes since they realize how essential it is to know our country's language. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In an effort to cap immigration, little attention or priority is being 
given to family unity and family reunification. An immigration legislation 
reform that does not respect this basic American tradition would be a step 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The thousands of undocumented immigrants who received amnesty under the 
1986 immigration law need support in meeting the education and documentation 
requirements of the law: English and civic classes, access to legal services 
and timely information are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In many corners of the world, refugee camps still overflow with people 
hoping for return to a more peaceful homeland or for acceptance in a new land; 
their plight and their voices reach out to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
These complex human, social and political issues confront the community of 
faith as it reflects on Jesus' message of reconciliation and on its 
relationship with Him. This relationship makes the church a sacrament of unity 
for the entire human family. 
</P>
<P>
As Pope John Paul II said in a recent encyclical letter, "Solidarity helps us 
to see the 'other' -- whether a person or nation -- not just as some kind of 
instrument, with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited at low 
cost and then discarded when no longer useful, but as our 'neighbor,' a 
'helper,' to be made a sharer on par with ourselves in the banquet of life to 
which all are equally invited by God." 
</P>
<P>
A protagonist, therefore, in the immigration debate, the Catholic Church 
follows the example of Christ and welcomes all newcomers -- not just for the 
economic contribution they make through their work -- but because they add an 
element of social enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
The church sees in all immigrants, refugees and displaced persons an 
avant-garde that builds a world family and, often through pain, witnesses the 
interdependence of the contemporary world. Surely immigrants arrive among us 
with their needs but they also bear gifts of energy, resourcefulness and hope 
that contribute to the renewal of both society and the church. 
</P>
<P>
In a complex world, the encounter with newcomers reminds us of a simple fact: 
We are all brothers and sisters, one family. In this way, isolation and 
hostility are impractical and misdirected attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Lay men and women, pastors and religious, natives and immigrants are called and 
empowered to heal the breaches in human solidarity. In fact, we are all 
instruments through whom God's work of creation, redemption and sanctification 
is brought together on earth. His plan is for a world family where the earth's 
resources are for the common good, where barriers fall and a special blessing 
and care go to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Most people do not migrate because they want to. Immigrants are transnational 
actors crossing from less developed to richer countries, and even if they are 
not aware of it, they show the interdependence of the world economy. A sense of 
moral responsibility for the countries of emigration can transform 
interdependence into solidarity. The impact, therefore, of our national 
decisions and policies goes beyond our borders and can affect all along the 
journey of migrants from the start in their native countries to the point of 
integration into our society. To enable the weaker countries to develop and to 
participate in making a contribution of their own to the common good becomes an 
effective remedy to forced migrations. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation to confuse ethnic origin with religion could block the way of 
solidarity and allow the tyranny of lesser loyalties to stifle the bonding 
together of natives and newcomers in the common task of developing another 
creative moment in the growth of the church and of the country. Different 
cultural traditions and pastoral structures become as many valuable paths 
leading to the acceptance of diversity within a basic Gospel unity. 
</P>
<P>
The positive lesson the immigrants' presence teaches comes from the heart of 
the Gospel, that we are one world family. The expression of this conviction is 
in mutual knowledge, respect and love that enable us to find the fullness of 
ourselves in solidarity with others. We learn intercultural relations not just 
to fight prejudice or to manage interethnic relations with less conflict, but 
rather, as a way to live solidarity in our environment, as a new style of 
community needed now more than ever for the development of a pluralistic 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Projections indicate that immigration will continue due to economic disparity, 
a chronic lack of jobs, persistent political upheavals -- and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Our pastoral response has been moving on the twin track of justice and 
evangelization articulated in policy advocacy, and the delivery of services 
within our church structures. 
</P>
<P>
Together with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the archdiocese's 
policy for undocumented persons includes support for expansion of legalization, 
a commitment to change the employer sanctions of the immigration law, safe 
haven for displaced persons and the development of poorer countries. We stand 
firm on the priority right of family reunion within a reasonable time. 
Immigrants and refugees will continue to find a voice in the church where 
acceptance and love have no borders. 
</P>
<P>
Day after day, and with exceptional generosity, our archdiocese advises newly 
arrived immigrants and refugees, sponsors family reunification, provides legal 
assistance and teaches English. At the regional and parish levels a variety of 
services are offered that witness our concern for the total person. 
</P>
<P>
Allow me to stress the irreplaceable role of the parish where multicultural 
communities of faith can flourish. A "policy of inclusion" should be part of 
the pastoral plan of each parish. 
</P>
<P>
In our parishes geographical distance has given way to the actual presence of 
people from every continent and culture. Newcomers must be welcomed as Christ 
is welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual participation in the development of the parish future will succeed if 
there is a warm, loving and exciting attitude of acceptance; if time and space 
are made available to people to meet one another at their leisure in 
friendship, if expressive, person-centered and vibrant liturgies teach as much 
as they touch the heart. 
</P>
<P>
In moments of rethinking, retrenching and anxiety in the public debate on the 
presence and meaning of newcomers and their cultures, we are reminded that 
"hospitality" is the most concrete example of our solidarity with the world 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Scriptures state, "continue to love each other like brothers and sisters, 
and remember always to welcome strangers, for by doing this, some people have 
entertained angels without knowing it."

DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciate the editorial. It condemns Capitol Hill for greeting Reagan's 
final budget message with yawns. It labels the alleged $92.5-billion deficit "a 
sham." The real deficit is closer to $140 billion because about $50 billion in 
temporary surplus Social Security trust-fund revenues is counted against the 
deficit. The deficit may be greater, depending on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
I would add my personal outrage at Reagan's request for a 2% increase above the 
inflation rate in Pentagon spending -- at a time of huge deficits and when 
there is hope for an end to the cold war and the arms race. 
</P>
<P>
The last line of the editorial, " . . . Washington needs to hear a little 
outrage," is right on target. It gave me the energy to write my congressman. 
Thanks.

Of course there is outrage at Reagan's budget. Every clear-thinking citizen who 
heard of the proposed $92.5-billion deficit is outraged and disgusted. 
Evidently, after eight years of the state of California budget preparation and 
eight years of the same exercise in the White House, Reagan has learned 
nothing. He spends the nation's money the same way Nancy replenishes her 
wardrobe . . . borrowing, keeping, and never paying the debt. Reagan's last 
budget only makes George Bush all the more welcome.

QUALIFIED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your criticism of George Bush for selecting only one woman to serve in his 
15-member Cabinet ("Cabinet: Familiar Faces," Dec. 30), was well-taken. I 
couldn't help but notice, however, that of the 15 members of The Times' senior 
management listed on the same page, it appears that only one, Associate Editor 
Jean Sharley Taylor, is a woman, and she is at the bottom of the list. 
</P>
<P>
Surely it is no more difficult to recruit qualified female newspaper executives 
than it is to find qualified women to serve in the President's Cabinet. Perhaps 
"where women are concerned, (The Times also) needs to fish in a deeper pond."

DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading your editorial "Why No Outrage?" (Jan. 10), I became outraged! 
You bet! But who really cares? I was outraged when Ronald Reagan was elected 
President the first time because his math was all screwed up. When you think 
that you can lower taxes, raise defense spending, and balance the budget you 
should have your head examined. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote to you protesting his reelection in 1984 after watching Reagan give a 
speech about his perceived greatness at the Republican Convention. His math was 
still screwed up! That was outrageous! He should have been arrested for lying 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
But after watching this ding-dong get elected twice and people wanting him to 
run for yet another term, I've given up! When you're outnumbered by ding-dongs 
you better run for the hills! Are the patients really running the asylum? 
Apathy, apathy, apathy.

<P>
The editorial deplored the lack of "outrage" regarding the truly staggering 
deficits the Administration has incurred. 
</P>
<P>
It is an outrage that in times of peace we run such deficits. It is an outrage 
that in times of economic properity we run such deficits. It is an outrage that 
the Administration has used this device to lead the populace into a false sense 
of security. It is an outrage that no one seems to be outraged about this, that 
few voices call out. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade the United States has evolved from the world's leading 
creditor nation to the world's leading debtor nation. If the consequences of 
this condition are as serious as I imagine, I think the damage to our society 
will far outweigh any suffered in past wars, and that the political historians 
of the next generation could label this outrage as treason.

KING'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had he lived, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have celebrated his 60th 
birthday today. He would be proud of the progress that has resulted from the 
civil-rights movement that he led. Legal segregation by race is prohibited. 
Laws safeguard equal opportunity in the workplace, in housing, in schools, in 
the courts, at the polls, in every public arena. 
</P>
<P>
Black Americans have made spectacular individual gains since King's 
assassination in 1968. Elected officials, lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, 
journalists -- the list of black achievement goes on and on. The future holds 
even greater promise for black children. 
</P>
<P>
"I am free to become a lawyer, a doctor or even a judge because Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. marched for justice, peace and freedom for all," wrote Lana 
Wade, 9, a fourth-grader at Western Avenue School. "I might even become 
governor of one of our 50 states such as Pennsylvania . . . . I can be a 
preacher, a teacher, mother or even Ms. Texas." Her essay was a winner in the 
annual contest sponsored by the Los Angeles branch of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, the national civil-rights organization founded by King 
30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But as a recent Times series, "The Racial Gap," points out, neither fame nor 
fortune can immunize the successful members of minority groups from old 
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
The new form of racism may be more subtle, but the assumptions are the same. 
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young comes out of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York 
and a guest assumes that he isa parking attendant. A popular black broadcaster 
moves into a wealthy Miami neighborhood and a neighbor assumes that she is the 
cleaning lady. A black pediatrician practices in Washington, D.C., and white 
colleagues assume that her patients are poor, teen-age mothers. The insulting 
misperceptions are not harmless. The slights can take an even greater toll when 
the stale stereotypes carry over into the workplace or into social situations. 
</P>
<P>
When integration was a novelty, Americans seemed to make a greater effort to 
integrate socially. With the passage of time, that is no longer the case. 
Minorities often seem invisible at major social events. Although mingling at a 
cocktail party may seem a small matter, being ignored exacts a penalty higher 
than simply spoiling a good time. Social contacts are often essential to job 
advancement and business. 
</P>
<P>
King fought for opportunity -- an equal shot at decent jobs, housing, schools, 
futures. There have been gains. And losses. Millions of black Americans, an 
underclass, live in poverty. As the nation pays tribute to the civil-rights 
leader on his birthday, Americans must again make a conscious effort against 
racism of every kind and degree.

BANK EXAMINATIONS -- SYSTEM NEEDING REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE CHAMPION and PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, George Champion is retired chairman 
of Chase Manhattan Bank. Paul Craig Roberts, a former assistant secretary of 
the Treasury, is the William E. Simon professor of political economy at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As financial markets become more deregulated and banks undertake riskier 
ventures for which they have no historical experience, the stability of the 
financial system is more dependent than ever on sound bank examinations. The 
current system, which is incompetent and rife with conflict of interests, 
requires reform. 
</P>
<P>
The process of bank examination in the United States, entrusted to the 
Comptroller of Currency and the Federal Reserve, has broken down. Bank 
examiners have stood aside while traditional rules of sound banking have been 
discarded. In some instances examiners have pushed unsound banking practices on 
banks. Banking problems in Chicago, Oklahoma and Texas are evidence that bank 
examinations have become virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in recent years the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for 
examining state-chartered member banks, has created a conflict of interest for 
itself that undermines its ability to perform an honest examination in some 
instances. During the 1980s banks that refused to lend money to Third World 
governments to pay interest on their existing indebtedness were requested by 
Federal Reserve officials to reconsider. Such circumstances make it impossible 
for a bank examiner to criticize a loan requested by the Fed or a comparable 
one made without the Fed's intervention. The overall impact is to lower 
examination standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve should be relieved of its examining responsibilities. These 
responsibilities should be given to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which, 
as the agency responsible for insuring the banks' deposits, has the strongest 
incentive to keep banks out of trouble. As the FDIC does not conduct monetary 
policy, it does not have the enormous scope for conflict of interest that 
bedevils the Fed. The comptroller's office, with beefed-up capacity, should 
continue with the responsibility for examining national banks. 
</P>
<P>
Some dispute our view, claiming instead that such practices as lending money to 
pay interest simply round-trip the funds to the bank, thus preventing technical 
default rules from causing a crisis. However, when a bank increases a loan in 
order to receive interest, it leaves its balance sheet in a weaker position. 
The round-tripped funds are added to profits, which are subject to taxation and 
to any profit-sharing or bonus program based on earnings. By lending money to 
pay interest, banks add more to their problem loans than they are able to 
retain from the interest received. 
</P>
<P>
In a world in which solutions to problems often consist of weakening the 
standards of the past, our criticisms may seem dogmatic. However, the evidence 
of problem banks is everywhere. Taxpayer bailout of bankrupt savings-and-loan 
associations is now estimated to cost $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If bank examiners had enforced standards, the problems afflicting our financial 
institutions would not have materialized. However, during a period when bank 
lending exploded in proportion to bank capital, examinations became 
increasingly meaningless and in some cases perverse. Banks were even required 
by law to reduce their reserve for bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
The availability of funds in the Euro-dollar market together with the increase 
in the guaranty of deposits by the FDIC made it possible for commercial banks 
to increase their lending. By 1970 many banks' loans exceeded 10 times their 
capital -- an all-time high. This beginning was followed by a real explosion in 
the loan-to-capital ratio as a result of lending to Third World governments and 
government-sponsored agencies. Total loans of some major banks swelled to 30 
times their capital. Only when this occurred together with evidence that Third 
World countries were having difficultly with their debts did the Federal 
Reserve suggest that banks should increase their capital. 
</P>
<P>
The financial problem in the banking sector is primarily the responsibility of 
bank managers. However, these problems developed over a period of years, and if 
the examining authorities had done their job, unsound practices would have been 
halted before they became major problems. One of the basic rules of banking is 
that no bank should lend more than 10% of its capital to any one borrower. Yet 
80% of the loans to several Third World countries went to government entities 
and totaled more than 50% of the capital of some banks. The examiners obviously 
approved this unsound concentration of lending. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s prudent bank management has brought criticism from the 
comptroller's office for not showing sufficient profits. In one case a bank 
that cleaned up its investments, charged off all non-performing loans, built a 
bad-debt reserve of 3% of loans outstanding and maintained a capital base of 9% 
of total assets drew the ire of the examiner. This is not an extreme or 
isolated example. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown in bank examinations has coincided with the public's lack of 
attention to the quality of management of institutions in which they place 
funds. Fraud and risky lending practices have multiplied, especially among S 
&amp; Ls, but depositors, protected by federal guarantees, have had no 
incentive to monitor the management of their financial institutions or to 
remove their funds from risky S &amp; Ls. 
</P>
<P>
It may be the case that no one any longer knows what sound banking practices 
are. On the other hand, major accounting firms might have senior partners who 
could establish training programs for the comptroller and the FDIC that would 
refurbish the process of bank examination and make it again contribute to the 
security of our financial institutions. In these days of so much talk about 
cooperation between the public and private sectors, this is one that might be 
worthwhile exploring.

REAGAN HELD FAST TO SENSE OF PURPOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID S.BRODER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the oldest living Americans can recall only three Presidents who served at 
least two terms and left office still held in high regard by most of their 
fellow-citizens: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and now Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year stretch of unbroken, noninflationary economic growth that Reagan 
calls his proudest achievement is described by George F. Will, in an incisive 
Newsweek essay on his White House friend, as "a debilitating feast," force-fed 
by huge budget deficits that "mortgaged much of our future vitality." 
</P>
<P>
I share that view, but the legacy of deficit spending can be overcome if 
prosperous Americans accept a slightly reduced standard of living and the 
necessity of paying the bills Reagan postponed. More worrisome to me is the 
damage that half a generation of young Americans has suffered as a result of 
Reagan policies, which widened the gap between rich and poor, between whites 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
History will not deal kindly with his Administration's deliberate efforts to 
slow down or reverse the two previous decades of steady progress in reducing 
poverty and discrimination. It was not just Ed Meese and Brad Reynolds pushing 
Justice Department lawyers into court battles to reopen settled issues of 
civil-rights enforcement. It was Reagan himself signaling moral indifference to 
the struggle for equality. 
</P>
<P>
He was neither heartless nor biased personally, but he was deaf to calls for 
justice. The Great Communicator used all his rhetorical tools to advance the 
causes he cared about; unfortunately, justice was not one of them. In his 
farewell address, to take but the latest example, the word "freedom," or its 
variants and derivatives, appears 15 times; the word "justice," not at all. He 
frets about young people's ignorance of America's heritage. But for eight 
years, he encouraged the nation to forget that the Pledge of Allegiance gives 
equal weight to "liberty and justice for all." 
</P>
<P>
But there have been offsetting gains. The appraisals of the Reagan presidency 
give due notice to the peaceful character of the world scene as he departs and 
the dramatic improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, for which he must share 
plaudits with Mikhail Gorbachev and others. 
</P>
<P>
It's unimaginable that the rush of state-local initiatives in education, 
economic development, welfare reform, housing and other fields would have 
occurred if Reagan had not effectively slammed the door on preemptive federal 
action. The result has been an invigoration of those close-to-home governments, 
the emergence of a dynamic generation of state and local leaders and, one must 
believe, a greater sense of involvement by citizens in the challenge of 
improving their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
That is one major part of the Reagan legacy I hope will not be lost or 
forgotten.

KING SITE HONORS HIS MEMORY

<P>
Dennis Ulysees, 31, a stonemason from Tacoma, Wash., stood in front of Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s resting place, his right arm wrapped around his daughter, 
Casandra, 10. Neither spoke for several minutes. Both just stood there gazing 
at the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
As they left, Ulysees explained he had brought his daughter to the Martin 
Luther King Jr. National Historic Site so she could learn more about the slain 
civil rights leader. "I want her to know him, to know how important he was for 
black people like us," Ulysees said. "I want her to live her life with his life 
as a model." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Charlene Mitchell Rogers, a Detroit television newscaster, 
appeared with her son, Jonathan, 8. "I came to Atlanta especially to visit the 
site," Rogers said. "I brought my son along because I believe it is essential 
he come here. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never known segregation," continued Rogers, 39. "He has grown up in a 
privileged environment. I want to make certain he knows who he is and where he 
came from, that this man was responsible for the freedoms he has. I don't want 
him ever to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Every day people gather here in the heart of Atlanta's Sweet Auburn district to 
pay homage to King, who died April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., the victim of an 
assassin's bullet. But on this day, which would have been King's 60th birthday, 
thousands are expected to gather at the site's reflecting pool where his tomb 
is mounted on a pedestal. Inscribed on his crypt are King's words: "Free at 
last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last." 
</P>
<P>
The two-block-long national historic site was set aside by Congress in 1980 and 
has been administered since by the National Park Service. Its purpose is to 
protect and interpret for the benefit, inspiration and education of present and 
future generations the place where Martin Luther King Jr. was born, lived, 
worked and worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year 840,000 visitors came here, half black, half white," explained 
Randolph Scott, 58, a former Norfolk, Va., high school history teacher who has 
been the site's superintendent for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the site's points of interest: the home at 501 Auburn Ave. where King was 
born; his tomb a block away at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for 
Non-Violent Social Change, founded in 1968 and headed by his wife, Coretta 
Scott King; and Ebenezer Baptist Church, located two blocks from his 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Father, Grandfather 
</P>
<P>
His father, Martin Luther King Sr., was pastor of the church from 1931 to 1975; 
his grandfather, A. D. Williams, presided from 1894 to 1931. Martin Luther King 
Jr. preached his first sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church when he was 17 and 
served as co-pastor with his father from 1960 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It was there that his body lay in state and also where his mother, Alberta 
Williams King, was slain six years later as she played the organ during a 
religious service. 
</P>
<P>
At the two-story, 14-room Queen Anne clapboard home where King was born and 
lived until 1941, visitors are taken on a tour by ranger Shelly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people say they can feel Dr. King's spirit, feel his presence in this 
house," said Lewis, 30, of Bolton, Miss. "Many visitors get quite emotional. 
They break down and cry." 
</P>
<P>
Also born there were his brother, A. D., who drowned in a swimming pool 
accident in 1969, and his sister, Christine King Farris, a professor at 
Atlanta's Spelman College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Belongings 
</P>
<P>
The home contains the family's original furniture, including the piano King 
played as a boy, his baseball glove, Monopoly game, family icebox and washing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Auburn was a mecca of Atlanta's leading black business and commercial 
enterprises and a middle-class black residential area when Martin Luther King 
lived here," site superintendent Scott said. The Park Service now owns 13 
turn-of-the-century homes and buildings in 21.5-acre site and plans to acquire 
27 more, he said. Seven have already been restored to their original state. 
</P>
<P>
Among the area's buildings is Atlanta's famed Royal Peacock Club where Duke 
Ellington, Billy Eckstein, Louis Armstrong and other well-known black 
entertainers performed. John Wesley Dobbs, grandfather of former Atlanta Mayor 
Maynard H. Jackson, is credited with giving the area its nickname, Sweet 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
At the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change, the Park 
Service operates a museum filled with memorabilia and photographs highlighting 
the life of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
On display are the Nobel Peace Prize he received as well as the Medal of 
Freedom, his clothing, clerical robes and favorite neckties. Behind glass is 
the key to Room 307 at the Lorraine Hotel where King was killed, the wallet he 
was carrying when shot, his handwritten sermons and well-worn Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important to my mother, my brother and my two sisters is the 
ever-growing interest in my father and what he worked for in his lifetime," 
said Martin Luther King III, 31, a Fulton County, Ga., commissioner. "I hope 
and pray it will continue to grow with his memory helping to achieve justice 
and equality for all mankind."

THAT'S THE TICKET;

<P>
IN THE FRENZY TO FIND LAST-MINUTE INAUGURAL INVITATIONS, THE RESOURCEFUL RELY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any party to which 116,000 people have been invited would hardly be considered 
exclusive. But the presidential Inaugural Ball, which is so big it will be 
staged at eight sites on Friday, is something special -- at least to some 
people. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't so special that any of the former Presidents will help celebrate the 
inauguration of George Herbert Walker Bush and James Danforth Quayle. 
Invitations went to Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, but all have 
indicated they will not attend. 
</P>
<P>
But thousands of social climbers across the land feel differently about the 
usually snowbound ball. And the real die-hards among them still are scrambling 
for invitations. 
</P>
<P>
Unless they're on the "A+" guest list submitted by the Bushes and Quayles (a 
list that includes members of the submarine crew who rescued pilot Bush after 
he was shot down in the Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944,) would-be guests' fates lie 
in hands of the inaugural chairmen in each of the 50 states and the American 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
State chairs are told by the inaugural committee how long their invitation 
lists can be. Then the states submit those lists to the committee, which mails 
invitations for guests to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chairs and their coordinators are suffering from telephone ear burn 
handling calls from would-be guests, some who are openly panicky and try 
begging, while others try the quieter, look-down-the-nose demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking the Calls 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we get a lot of people who are indignant," said Kim Whitman, the Oregon 
coordinator. "They're saying, 'I cannot believe I did not get an invitation. If 
George heard about this he'd be furious! Do you have any idea who I am?' I'm 
going, 'No, I don't have a clue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Utah coordinator Amanda Pahnke said: "The calls I found most amusing were 
people who called, and were, of course, personal friends of George Bush, and 
said they shouldn't be wasting their time talking to me, but they wanted to 
make sure I knew they were VIPs." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the calls come from invited guests, who, because of mailing delays by 
the committee, haven't received their invitations. The fretful party-goers 
don't know if their invitation has been delayed. Or could it be that some 
underling at the Washington inaugural committee spotted the name and said, 
"Invite them? Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
"The calls I've had are from people who are frantic, their reservations are 
made and they've bought their gowns," said Pahnke. "That's what I've been 
dealing with for three days. I've had some swearing and some serious phone 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
The non-refundable, reduced air fares are wonderful bargaining chips in 
negotiating for tickets to this inaugural: Surely, the argument goes, anyone 
dumb enough to go ahead and buy an airline ticket deserves to go to the ball. 
This strategy often works better than trying to exaggerate one's importance to 
Bush, because the state chairs are wise to the campaign who-was-who. The formal 
ball, the biggest social event of the five-day inaugural celebration, is 
primarily for those who worked on the Bush campaign or poured money into it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people calling had real or imagined experience working their tail 
off on the elect-Bush effort," said Whitman, who was executive director of the 
Oregon Bush-Quayle committee, an undertaking small enough that he knew everyone 
else involved. "I say, 'Were you at headquarters?' And they say, 'Oh, no, I 
worked out of my own home.' Then I say, 'Under whose supervision? What exactly 
was it you did?' I'd never heard of them and yet they were trying to tell me 
how much money they raised. And I'd say, 'Where did the money go? We never saw 
any checks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Inaugural co-chair Bobby Holt, who has enough work on his hands supervising the 
raising of the total inaugural's $25-million cost, still has the mundane chore 
of dealing with some ball ticket-seekers who get through to him on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'I was the assistant finance adviser to Bush's (1970) Senate race,' 
and I'm sure they were," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls to Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
California coordinator Rick Davis, who works in Gov. George Deukmejian's 
office, said he is receiving 50 calls a day and could have submitted 5,000 
names to the inaugural committee if he had not been limited to 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of them have been Republican supporters," he said. "A couple of them 
said, 'I sat right behind Ronald Reagan last time and I certainly should be 
invited this time.' Nothing outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Some people don't even try to come up with a good reason why they should be 
invited. This earns high marks for honesty, but loses points on artistic 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally they don't couch it with much creativity," said Penne Percy Korth, 
co-chair of the inaugural committee. "It's usually, 'Here I am. Please send me 
a ticket.' " 
</P>
<P>
Whitman explained to one caller the criteria to get on the invitation list: 
First are those most active in the Bush-Quayle campaign; then those who donated 
money to it; then longtime GOP donors; then well-known Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The caller replied: "Well, I didn't do any of those things. I just feel like, I 
voted for him and as an American, I ought to get an invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Whitman took his name and is trying to get him an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Of course that invitation probably will not be to the ball, but to other less 
popular events, such as the youth ball or the vice president's reception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little, Liberal Oregon 
</P>
<P>
The states have vastly differing ball ticket allotments. Oregon happens to have 
everything going against it in criteria the committee used to decide this: The 
state is small, far from Washington, has a Democratic governor and its seven 
electoral votes went to Dukakis. Little, liberal Oregon got 10 ball 
invitations; there were 2,000 for big, Republican Texas, Bush's home state. 
</P>
<P>
California -- another huge Bush electoral state with a Republican governor -- 
received about 1,500 ball tickets. New York, which is just a three-hour train 
ride from Washington and is more populous than Texas, received only 800 
invitations; it, of course, has a Democratic governor and went to Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
There were 58,000 invitations for two mailed for the ball and its "A" list 
guests. Many more invitations were sent for other inaugural events for guests 
on the "B" list. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are about 400,000 commemorative invitations, suitable for 
framing but not for entree to any event. To receive a commemorative, the 
hopefuls probably only need a pulse and enough money to call a state chair and 
scream until they get one. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the great untold secret of the whole inaugural affair is that if 
guests want badly enough to go to any of its events -- even the coveted ball -- 
all they probably need is money (for transportation, hotel and $175 ball 
ticket), moxie and a phone. 
</P>
<P>
Some states have tickets they don't need, and with some fast talking -- surely 
you were born there or attended one of their fine schools -- the state chairman 
can be talked out of a pair. 
</P>
<P>
Utah, for example, was allotted 190 invitations; as of the second week of 
January, only about 110 takers were willing to foot the air fare and hotel bill 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people from other states who were originally from Utah calling, 
mostly people in Virginia and Washington and some Californians," said Utah 
coordinator Pahnke, who said she accommodated them. 
</P>
<P>
A frazzled Texas coordinator, who asked not to be named, said she had 2,000 
invitations but "between 4,000 and 6,000 requests." But next door in Oklahoma, 
coordinator Sharon Sharp reported the state allotment of 225 was "plenty. We 
have only gotten four or five requests from people who did not receive ball 
invitations. We've been very successful in trying to get one for everyone who 
wants one. I haven't had anyone from other states call, except some Oklahomans 
in Washington, and I put them on our list." 
</P>
<P>
There is much more interest in attending inaugural events among those who live 
close to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Alaska Contingent 
</P>
<P>
"To be bloody honest," Alaska coordinator Yvonne Alford says, "making up the 
invitation list is much easier for us because it's so bloody far away and costs 
so bloody much money. You're talking about $3,000 for a cheapo trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have folks jostling to get in like other states do. Alaska probably 
won't have more than 30 people in Washington for the inaugural -- our members 
of Congress, a few campaign people, and the biggies who have the money to come. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple conservative bankers here going. Arco (Atlantic Richfield 
Oil Co.) has been kind to George Bush so some of the Arco officials here are 
going." Alaska's National Guard Eskimo Scouts will participate in the parade 
but not attend the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in the Washington area, phones are ringing off the hook at the 
inaugural offices for Virginia (656 invitations), Maryland (623) and the 
District of Columbia (162). 
</P>
<P>
Even more difficult to obtain are the small number of tickets available for the 
Capitol swearing-in ceremony. These tickets are issued by Congress. An aide to 
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said the senator would give out 11 tickets and had 
a waiting list of hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
The state inaugural coordinators report they have handled all kinds of 
questions. One caller asked if his invitation was delayed because he had been 
investigated by the Secret Service in connection with an alleged assassination 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
Some guests want to know how to get around Washington. "Our party is in the 
Pension Building," Oklahoma coordinator Sharp said. "It's kind of in a bad area 
of town. I tell people if you walk, walk in a group." 
</P>
<P>
Other callers want fashion advice. "I was just amazed that somebody spending a 
couple thousand bucks to go to the inaugural would ask Kim Whitman what to 
wear," said Oregon coordinator Whitman, a 48-year-old real estate man. "I say, 
'Wear basic black, discreet cleavage and since you're from Oregon, galoshes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Whitman is not worrying about what he will wear to the Inaugural Ball because 
he's not going. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be around all those angry people I've been talking to on the 
phone," he said. "It hasn't even occurred to me to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO INVITE YOURSELF "I cannot believe I did not get an invitation. If George 
heard about this he'd be furious! Do you have any idea who I am?" 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am. Please send me a ticket." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the assistant finance adviser to Bush's (1970) Senate race," 
</P>
<P>
"I sat right behind Ronald Reagan last time and I certainly should be invited 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I just feel like, I voted for him, and as an American, I ought to get an 
invitation."

TAKE MY WORD!: SOME LINGUISTIC ISSUES WITH WEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MIDDLETON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"God said, Let there be light, and there was light." 
</P>
<P>
That was long, long ago. More recently, some advertising man said, "Let there 
be lite," and, God help us, there was lite." Lite, presumably, was created to 
make life easier for people who have problems with spelling and pronunciation. 
Lite obviously rhymes with bite. It also rhymes with byte, bight, and indict -- 
and, appropriately, with blight. 
</P>
<P>
For what seems like a decade, we've been bombarded, especially if we are fans 
of televised sports, by a surfeit of what I think of as Three-Stooges-class 
humor involving the confusion of various kinds of lights with an abomination 
labeled light or lite beer. "Gimme a light," says some poor boob, and millions 
of dollars' worth of all hell breaks loose in the form of theatrical lighting, 
when all the guy wants is "a light beer." 
</P>
<P>
Light beer (some beers seem to be light and some lite, and I'm not going to 
write lite unless I have to) is generally touted as light not because it is 
lighter in color than regular beer, nor even because it has fewer calories, but 
because it has "less calories." Well, I suppose beer advertising is designed to 
appeal to those of us with a Three Stooges mentality, so less calories is 
probably appropriate. Highfalutin words like fewer could be jarring and thus 
counterproductive in the old Three Stooges Taproom. 
</P>
<P>
The reason light beer has fewer calories than regular beer is probably that it 
has less alcohol by volume. I've tasted light beer a couple of times, and to me 
it tastes like nothing but watered beer. I could be mistaken, but I've been 
drinking beer for at least 45 years, and while I don't consume nearly so much 
now as I did in the '40s and '50s, the old taste buds are still active, and my 
first taste of light beer led me to refer to it as a "beer highball." Light 
beer costs the same as regular beer, so it seems to me that if you buy light 
beer you could economize by changing to old-fashioned beer and adding water. 
</P>

Obviously, light is a versatile word. Regarding "light beer," it means 
"containing less alcohol." About 10 years ago, light beer had a different 
meaning. You might remember that back then, most of the brewers, at least here 
in California, changed the size of the standard beer can from 12 ounces to 11 
ounces. With no fanfare whatsoever, they simply shrank the cans. I guess beer 
drinkers caught on. Twelve-ounce cans have been back for some time now. 
</P>
<P>
Have you noticed that the coffee companies have pulled a similar stunt lately? 
I noticed that one brand of coffee cost almost 20% less than the one I usually 
bought. Naturally, I switched to the cheaper brand. I could at least give it a 
try, and I admit that I'm not a critical connoisseur of coffee. Today, I'll 
admit with some embarrassment that I actually continued to buy the cheaper 
brand for several weeks until I just happened to notice that the can, which 
looked like all coffee cans, said on its label "13 Oz." Some sharp entrepreneur 
had made a breakthrough: the 13-ounce pound of coffee. No wonder the can cost 
almost 20% less. It contained almost 20% less. 
</P>
<P>
Such a brilliant invention -- the 13-ounce pound -- could not be kept 
exclusively by the Folger's folks (for it was they who introduced it, at least 
to me). Nowadays, the only coffees I can find in my local supermarket that stay 
with the old unimaginative 16-ounce can are French Market and Martinson's. All 
the others seem to have discovered the advantages of the 13-ounce pound of 
coffee. Again, they haven't put forth a big publicity campaign announcing the 
new, easier-to-carry size. 
</P>
<P>
I've switched to the 16-ounce brands. They may be heavier, but I can use the 
workout.

I, too, am a non-Orthodox Jew who identifies strongly with the Jewish people 
and resents any particular Jewish denomination or other subgroup dictating the 
criteria for who is a Jew. It is particularly offensive when the dictation 
comes from one of the smallest grouping of the Jewish people -- the religious 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
We in the Jewish community are well aware of the efforts of this small sect to 
dictate their terms to all Jews but the larger Southern California community is 
quite unaware of it. Your objective depiction of the issue is, however, more 
than a journalist's effort to bring attention to hitherto relatively unknown 
facets of our civilization. The phenomenon of the resurgence of religious 
fundamentalism is quite general throughout the world, from the Khomeini Shiites 
to the growth of a particular type of American Christian fundamentalism. Your 
article contributes to needed public education on this development.

I was very moved by the information provided about the individuals Elaine Woo 
interviewed, and their righteous indignation over the threat to redefine "Who 
Is a Jew?" (Dec. 22). 
</P>
<P>
We live in a changing world and each of us must constantly adapt and 
re-evaluate what our place is within that world. The couples she interviewed 
certainly coped with the tragedies they were confronted with, and their 
adjustment is one to be in awe of. When one has made the decision to convert to 
another religion, one can only admire the determination and conviction that led 
one to take the steps to realize that goal. As with many crucial decisions in 
our lives, our deep philosophical searchings cannot be ignored nor can they be 
legislated as inadequate or invalid by those with prejudiced viewpoints.

TWO VOTES AGAINST THE USE OF DNR ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Letting Go" (by Allan Parachini, Jan. 3) joins the lengthy list of articles 
and television productions intended to persuade the public that people have an 
obligation to forgo preventive and restorative care in the interest of not 
being a burden to their families and society. Death is promoted as therapeutic 
and treatment as cruel. If the public can be convinced that death is preferable 
to life and that the origin and acceptance of this philosophy comes from the 
people themselves, they will then more readily accept restrictions in care. 
</P>
<P>
In my experience in investigating medical complaints, I have witnessed the 
emphasis shift from efforts to assure adequate care for the aging and 
handicapped to an emphasis on death for all who can be manipulated into 
agreeing to let someone else determine when it is their time to "let go." The 
pendulum has swung so far that the assumption now is that patients who haven't 
left specific instructions that they want to live are presumed to prefer death. 
</P>
<P>
Those who resist limitations in care for elderly handicapped patients are 
subjected to tremendous pressure to agree to No Codes or DNRs. 
</P>
<P>
What are the motivations for withholding adequate care and thus prematurely 
precipitating death? No Codes provide medical personnel and facilities with 
prior immunity from civil and criminal liability and assist in cost 
containment, and greedy families can preserve and gain possession of 
inheritances without further delay. Deaths caused by human intervention would 
be considered crimes if they occurred outside the walls of institutions. 
However, because they occur within medical facilities, they are cloaked in 
respectability.

A NIGHTMARE FLIGHT LEAVES NONSMOKERS FUMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON DIRLAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What could be worse for a nonsmoker than the old days when airlines had no 
designated smoking sections? 
</P>
<P>
It's worse when the airline has a smoking section and puts a dozen nonsmokers 
in the last two rows of the plane, behind 60 cigarette-puffing die-hards, 
including a Middle Eastern trio with foul-smelling brown cigarettes that would 
put the fattest cigar to shame on the noxious fumes scale. 
</P>
<P>
Add 10 or 12 smokers from the nonsmoking section who come back at least once an 
hour, trade seats with fellow smokers, puff a fast couple of cigarettes and 
then head back to their relatively clean-air seating farther forward. 
</P>
<P>
Schedule this punishment on a transatlantic flight from which there is no 
escape and be sure the plane is full. In fact, hold the plane an extra 20 
minutes at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris to accommodate three standby 
passengers who arrived at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
In doing that, lose the jetliner's place in line and wait on the ground for 
another 90 minutes after getting a new takeoff time. That ensures that the poor 
smokers will really need a hit once the plane is aloft. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a worst-case scenario, but a real situation aboard a certain 
airline's flight from Paris to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checked in Early 
</P>
<P>
We had no seat assignments, but we checked in a full two hours ahead of flight 
time and were told that there were no seats left in the nonsmoking section. We 
were told to go ahead and take a seat assignment in the smoking section to be 
assured of getting seats at all, and to ask at the gate about getting our seats 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
We asked at the gate as soon as it opened, an hour later. We were told that it 
was too late to do anything about it in the terminal and to ask the flight 
attendant when we got on board if we could change our seats. 
</P>
<P>
When we boarded the plane we asked the flight attendant for seats in the 
nonsmoking section. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "Oh, they've made it our problem, huh?" She said to take our seats 
and ask the section attendant for a change. "There's a family of four behind 
you who are also nonsmokers," she said. "We've known about this problem since 
Geneva." 
</P>
<P>
"So, basically, we're just supposed to keep agitating?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no!" she said. "Please, that won't get you anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing got us anywhere except in the seats we were assigned, behind the 
smokers. But in front of a Swiss family of four, which included two medium-size 
children. 
</P>
<P>
We took our seats and read the fine print on the boarding pass, which declares: 
"(This airline) provides smoking and nonsmoking sections aboard flights 
scheduled for more than two hours. Assignment of no-smoking area seats to 
standby passengers and to passengers who present themselves at the boarding 
gates less than 20 minutes before scheduled departure time is subject to 
availability." 
</P>
<P>
But on this flight, all no-smoking seats were subject to availability. The 
airline did not accommodate nonsmokers who arrived two hours early. 
</P>
<P>
The flight attendants did ask a few people to volunteer to change their seats, 
especially for the Swiss family of four with their long, mournful faces, but no 
one was willing to budge. In the interests of getting background for this 
story, I chatted with a flight attendant while we waited for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," she said. "They should take better care of it at the gate. They 
should at least move the nonsmokers to the front of the smoking section instead 
of putting them way in the rear. On this flight we have several married couples 
split up, including a pregnant woman who wanted to sit with her husband. But at 
least we were able to find a single seat for her in a nonsmoking section. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem in Europe only," she said. "They don't really take it 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
As the flight wore on, people standing in the long lines to use the toilets 
were smoking cigarettes. One young woman smoked three in a row, sitting on a 
man's lap, before returning to her seat in another section. A flight attendant 
finally asked her to trade seats with a complainer in the smoking section. She 
left in a huff, only to return within the hour for another cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
We coughed, sneezed and sniffled. As aversion therapy, it worked. I'll never 
fly that airline again! 
</P>
<P>
The airline's vice president of public affairs said he is not aware of any such 
problems and that this was the first nonsmoker's complaint that had been 
brought to his attention. "Normally, we get complaints from smokers who had 
their seats taken away," he said. "I've never heard of this problem before." 
</P>
<P>
The airline's policy, he said, is to comply with U.S. law, separating smokers 
and nonsmokers on international as well as domestic flights. "Unless you 
arrived late or were on standby, there is no reason why you shouldn't have been 
given a seat in the no-smoking section. 
</P>
<P>
"This was human error," he said. "Somebody didn't follow procedures." 
</P>
<P>
The attendant at check-in said, "I'll be glad when they make the whole flight 
nonsmoking." 
</P>
<P>
I agree. Meanwhile, I would settle for smokers' seat assignments to be given 
starting in the back row and going forward instead of trying to mystically 
divine how many smokers there will be and piling in the nonsmokers behind them. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're at it, smoking privileges should be limited to those who asked 
for assigned seats in the smoking section. People who want to sit in clean air 
should not be allowed to add to the pollution elsewhere.

FOOTLOOSE IN THE NETHERLANDS: LEIDEN PRESERVES THE WORLD OF THE GOLDEN AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY, Beyer and Rabey are Los Angeles travel writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LEIDEN, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Such devotion to the ideals of freedom of conscience, religious tolerance and 
the separation of church and state that the Pilgrims took to Plymouth Rock in 
1620 almost surely owe more to their 11-year stay in this lovely Dutch town 
than to the repressive England they had fled. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the tolerant burghers and thriving textile business of Leiden also 
provided a haven to Belgian, French and other Europeans fleeing the 
Catholic-Reformist conflicts of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). 
</P>
<P>
To the Pilgrims' 1609 request for refuge, the town responded that it "refuses 
no honest people free entry . . . and the applicants' arrival here would be 
pleasing and welcome." Leiden further refused the British ambassador's request 
that the Pilgrims be extradited. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour train ride from Amsterdam (you may also skate the connecting canals 
in winter), Leiden has the Netherlands' oldest and most prestigious university, 
the University of Leiden, founded in 1575 by William of Orange; the 
university's 1590 botanical gardens that imported the first tulips from Turkey 
five years later, and a marvelous setting at the confluence of the old and new 
Rhine rivers. 
</P>
<P>
All of the 17th-Century canals and streets of Leiden are still in place, and a 
restored windmill, such as Rembrandt's father ran (the painter was born a few 
steps away), still spins at town center. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly KLM nonstop to Amsterdam, or British Airways, SAS, Air France 
or Northwest with changes. Take a train (every 15 minutes) from the airport 
(Schiphol) to Leiden in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Two days for the town's considerable sights. It's a great 
and restful base for visiting Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Delft and the 
flower and cheese markets of Keukenhof and Alkmaar, all a short train ride 
away. Good accommodations are moderate, dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Dutch guilder, or florin, recently traded at 51 cents. 
Best times for a visit are from the end of April until late fall, with winter 
an invigorating experience. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: The Hotel Mayflower (Beestenmarkt 2; $76 B&amp;B double) is 
a small, fresh and modern place tucked into an old canal house on a busy 
mid-town square a short walk from the train station. The lobby and breakfast 
room are as bright as can be, with contemporary furniture and lots of plants. 
Antique furniture sits tastefully in otherwise modern rooms with color TV; it's 
a charming mix. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Restaurant De Doelen (Rapenburg 2; $41 to $77 B&amp;B double) began as a 
patrician town house in 1435, and retains beamed bedrooms, an old stairwell, 
regal entryway and other historic touches. Room No. 9 has a gorgeous tiled 
fireplace with sailing ship on the mantel and four comfortable chairs around a 
table. There's a real feeling of the Netherlands' Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room has high ceiling and chandeliers opening to a vine-strewn patio 
at the rear. A four-course French menu is about $30. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuw Minerva (Boommarkt 23; $61-$74 B&amp;B double during high season) was 
once eight canal houses dating from 1600; now it's a very gezellig hotel, which 
means it's cozy, warm, comfortable and decidedly homey, including a communal 
carpet-covered table in the lobby -- a Dutch tradition. Bedrooms are adequate 
but lack charm. Breakfasts and all other meals are served in the hotel 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Dutch food is like the people: hearty, straightforward 
and easy to know. Perhaps the best example is hutspot met klapstuk, a robust 
stew of meat, potatoes, onions, carrots and whatever other vegetables are lying 
around the kitchen. It's very near the national dish, and our word "hodgepodge" 
derives from the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Erwtensoep, a green pea soup loaded with other fresh green vegetables, spicy 
sausage and perhaps small chunks of pig's feet, takes second place on the Dutch 
table hierarchy. Herring runs a close third; it's best eaten raw after dipping 
in chopped raw onions, and followed with brown bread, butter and a frosty beer. 
</P>
<P>
Hutspot is particularly good in Leiden, with some locals claiming they invented 
it, and also friese pof, a small loaf of raisin bread topped with sugar and 
cinnamon. It's served between meals with rich Dutch coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Little need be said about the Netherlands' great beers, but you might try the 
jenever, a Dutch gin often served with cold seafood hors d'oeuvres such as 
herring or smoked eel. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Malle Jan (Nieuwsteeg 11) is a romantic bistro-type place with old 
posters, klunky furniture, an open kitchen and solid French menu served at 
tables on two levels. We were thoroughly pleased with the escargot, a fine 
house pate, braised grouse with cranberries, and entrecote de veau lyonnaise, a 
heavenly piece of veal with onions. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Cafe in den Leidschen Salon (Steenstraat 2) appears to be an old home 
with large windows facing a busy square and canal with windmill. The menu is 
solid Dutch, drawing business types at lunch for the fish soup, salads, 
omelets, casseroles and uitsmijters, the last a hardy sandwich topped with a 
fried egg. Dine on the terrace during summer. 
</P>
<P>
Annie's Verjaardag (Hoogstraat 1) means the lady's birthday; it's a 
14th-Century vaulted cellar turned into a brasserie at water level, where the 
old and new Rhine meet. Tables inside always have candles burning, the menu 
running a gamut from French to Greek to Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Restaurant De Beukenhof (Terweeweg 2, Oegstgeest) hangs its 
Michelin star in a centuries-old inn a few minutes' drive from Leiden. Five 
dining rooms, each more beautiful than the last as you walk through, form a 
beautiful setting. Summer sees tables moved into the flowery garden, one set 
beneath a 300-year-old beech tree. 
</P>
<P>
We started with toasts of chilled jenever, followed by carpaccio of duck and a 
salad of sliced goose liver, then moved on to a sea brill fillet and turbot 
with lobster sauce, ending with a melange of Dutch and French cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
All this was helped along by a white Burgundian Rully of surprising stature, 
and a 1978 Chateauneuf du Pape, both from a magnificent cellar. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with a visit to the Stedelijk Museum with its collection of 
Old Masters displayed comfortably with artifacts and prints of the town's early 
days, including 17th-Century looms, in a handsome building that first served as 
a textile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Now take a turn through the university, paying particular attention to the 
"sweating room," where students awaited results of oral exams, the door 
emblazoned with Dante's lines: "Abandon all hope/ all who enter here." And 
don't miss Leiden's many hofjes, former almshouses usually gathered around a 
charming garden or courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most colorful pastimes we've enjoyed recently is a visit to the 
Monday and Tuesday morning Groenoordhallen market, where buyers from all of the 
Netherlands and Belgium come to buy beef. Their bargaining process, wherein 
buyer and seller slap hands vigorously in spirited bidding, is sealed with cold 
cash, the only exchange acceptable. Arrive early, wear sturdy shoes for the 
muck and plan on having a farm breakfast later in the hall's La Vache 
restaurant or Bistro Le Cochon de Lait. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Netherlands Board of Tourism at (415) 543-6772, 
or write to 90 New Montgomery St., Suite 305, San Francisco 94105, for a 
brochure on Leiden with city plan and sights, another on touring the 
Netherlands by rail and a map of the country.

Students who want to work abroad can get help in obtaining a work permit 
through the Council on International Educational Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The council is a private nonprofit organization involved in international 
education and student travel. It was founded in 1947 to help re-establish 
student exchanges after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 5,000 students participated in the council's "Work Abroad" programs. 
This year it will help students get permits for temporary work in Great 
Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council does not find jobs, it does give participants handbooks 
that include information about countries, job hunting and accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orientation and Advice 
</P>
<P>
Participants are invited to a meeting upon arrival in the country in which they 
wish to work, conducted by an affiliated foreign student travel service. Bureau 
members only act as advisers if problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
The fee for the program is $82. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign student travel services also can help with information on tax 
exempt situations. For example, if you live less than 84 days in Britain you 
gain a tax-exempt status. The usual tax deduction would be about 25%. 
</P>
<P>

The Irish student travel service (USIT) can help with temporary budget 
accommodations. It operates a new central accommodations center called Kinlay 
House. It can be used as a base. 
</P>
<P>
Even with tax breaks and budget accommodations, chances are that you won't be 
paid enough to save for the next school year. For example, last year's average 
weekly wage in New Zealand was about $150 U.S. An English teacher in Paris 
earned about $250, a bank clerk in Galway $170 and a secretary in London about 
$305. 
</P>
<P>
If you speak English you won't have to worry about the language in Great 
Britain, Ireland, New Zealand or Jamaica. But if you want to work in France, 
West Germany or Costa Rica you must know at least an intermediate level of 
French, German or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Britain program is available any time of the year, for up to six 
months. The Irish program is open all year, and you can work for up to four 
months. The French program is also available at any time of the year, but you 
can only work for three months. 
</P>
<P>
The West German program operates from June 1 to Oct. 1, the New Zealand program 
from April 1 to Oct. 31. The Jamaica and Costa Rica programs operate from June 
1 to Oct. 1.

PROBLEMS WITH TAXIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't recall when I've been more upset by a story in your section than the 
one written by Belcher, who complained about her taxi ride in New York City. If 
ever a story begged for the other side to be told, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers can be rude in any city, so can taxi passengers. One of my 
favorite taxi stories happened in New York City. I was making sales calls in 
Manhattan and jumping into a cab to reach each appointment. After one call I 
asked the driver to take me to the Pan Am building. He drove abut 50 feet, 
turned to me and kindly explained that he could drive ahead, turn left, turn 
left again and let me out or I could get out right there as we were right in 
front of the Pan Am building. Needless to say, I was embarrassed. The driver 
refused to take the payment I offered for the minimum amount that already 
appeared on the meter. 
</P>
<P>
My worst taxi experience happened in Los Angeles. After returning home from an 
international business trip I jumped into a cab at the airport and asked to be 
taken to my home in Torrance. It was about 4:30 p.m. and the San Diego Freeway 
was jammed. The driver weaved in and out of the heavy traffic, then sped wildly 
along the shoulder of the freeway for several miles. I was so frightened that 
as soon as we left the freeway I pointed to a house as my destination. I walked 
the few remaining blocks to my home. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Belcher had a bad attitude before she entered the cab and the driver 
simply reacted?

FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toni Taylor's article on "Problems at Airports" (Dec. 4) prompts me to write 
regarding two annoying situations at the Tom Bradley Terminal, Los Angeles 
International Airport. Visitors from abroad, including the elderly, very young 
and handicapped, often not fluent in English, have to get themselves through 
Immigration and Customs. 
</P>
<P>
They then find that they must pay $1 to obtain a baggage cart from the 
automatic machine. This requires that they have a $1 bill and that they read 
the instructions on the machine. After obtaining the cart they must push their 
way through the door of the terminal only to confront a very steep ramp to the 
passenger arrival area. Above this ramp is a large portrait of Mayor Bradley 
with the caption: "Welcome to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
First impressions are often important and long-lasting. I would suggest that 
some of the airport fees, such as the charge to passengers departing the United 
States, be diverted to provide free carts for arriving international 
passengers. Other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia provide 
this service. Why not here in Los Angeles? In addition, an easier way should be 
provided to the passenger arrival area from customs. Perhaps a moving walkway 
or an escalator?

A FRIENDLY SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years ago I traveled to Moscow, Leningrad, Central Asia and Mongolia with 
a tour company. The people never smiled and the food and air travel were 
deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer my travel companion and I (middle-aged ladies) were among the first 
Western tourists to cruise the Lena River in Siberia with a different cruise 
company. After the cruise we traveled by ourselves (with the assistance of 
Intourist) in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, Georgia and Turkistan. 
This time no one cared what reading material we carried, no one double-checked 
our money declarations and our 120 rolls of film were cheerfully hand-checked. 
</P>
<P>
Food and air travel were definitely improved. In the subways, on the streets 
and in the markets we received a thumbs-up response, plus gifts of fruit and 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate glasnost experience was in Tbilisi. We stood in line, like 
everyone else, to get a taxi to an outdoor museum. The driver and his passenger 
(a housewife unknown to him) were so overwhelmed at meeting Americans that they 
decided to stop at a market and buy us a melon. On arriving at the museum, a 
fairly lengthy trip, the driver indicated he would return for us at our 
convenience. He appeared at the exact time agreed upon. And later at our hotel 
he refused any money. Luckily, we carried little gifts in our 22-pocket 
photographer's vests.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: EASTERN EUROPE ON TOUR AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Love Holidays, a tour operator specializing in the mature market, has changed 
its name to Love Holidays/Uniworld to reflect its expanding sphere of travel to 
worldwide destinations. The company formerly emphasized travel to Eastern 
Europe, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialist countries of Eastern Europe should be among the most popular 
destinations for mature travelers this year, due to the warming trend between 
Eastern and Western governments and the controlled exchange rates in most 
Socialist countries that rarely fluctuate, in contrast to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
For this year, Love/Uniworld is offering a series of new tours that provide a 
choice of Eastern European destinations beginning in Austria and, depending on 
choice of itinerary, continuing to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danube Cruise 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Love/Uniworld tours combine the land portion in one or more 
countries with a seven-day cruise of the Danube that can offer visits to 
Belgrade and Budapest, as well as other cities on the river, depending on the 
itineraries. The vessel is the comfortable Rousse, which has all outside 
cabins, each with private shower and toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the Love/Uniworld tours is the "Highlights of Eastern Europe," 
highly regarded by first-time visitors to the Socialist nations. The pace of 
the 15-day itinerary is relaxed, and cities on the tour -- which begins in 
Vienna -- include Brno and Prague in Czechoslovakia; Dresden and East Berlin 
(crossing into West Berlin via Checkpoint Charlie); Poznan and Czestochowa, 
Krakow and Warsaw in Poland, and finally, a visit to Budapest, Hungary, before 
returning to Vienna for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
The "Highlights of Eastern Europe" tour includes round-trip air fare from West 
Coast cities (via Austrian Airlines), first- and superior-class hotels, daily 
breakfast, dinner each night (except in Vienna), highlight dinners in Prague, 
Warsaw and Budapest, including wine and entertainment, sightseeing fees and an 
experienced tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
Land portions are by modern air-conditioned buses (no smoking permitted). The 
all-inclusive price for this tour is from $2,272 to $2,427 per person, 
depending on departure dates. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements can be made for Danube cruises only, land tours combined with 
cruises on the Danube, or land tours only. All cruises begin in Vienna and 
visit one or more countries in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Other Love/Uniworld tours emphasize Yugoslavia, with visits to Mostar, Sarajevo 
and Dubrovnik as well as cities along the Dalmatian Coast. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-page brochure just released by Love/Uniworld is available, listing 
itineraries, hotels, departure dates and prices. The free brochure may be 
obtained by calling (800) 456-5683, (213) 873-7991 or (818) 501-6868. Or write 
to Love/Uniworld, 15315 Magnolia Blvd., Sherman Oaks 91403.

If Florida's Walt Disney World and Epcot Center are in your 1989 travel plans, 
a family hotel four miles from the Magic Kingdom is offering a 50% room 
discount for seniors, resulting in a modest $35 a day rate for two people. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Regency Inn, a 230-room low-rise resort set among lush tropical 
gardens. The Regency has two swimming pools, one covered and heated, free 
tennis courts with lights, a game room and a playground for children, and a 
guest laundry. Youths under 18 in the same room are housed free; rollaway beds 
are $6. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors must be 55 or older; a driver's license or membership in any of the 
major national senior organizations qualifies for the discount. Although the 
50% rate is on a space-available basis, reservations at that rate are confirmed 
if space is available at the time the reservation is made. 
</P>
<P>
The Regency Inn also has a series of modestly priced packages such as the "All 
in One," an eight-day, seven-night package that includes a one-day pass for 
each person to Epcot, Disney World and Sea World, a choice of Busch Gardens or 
Cypress Gardens for one day and a choice of three other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The package price is $281 per person, double occupancy. For an extra $33 you 
can get a rental car for the week, with unlimited mileage. 
</P>
<P>
For a brochure describing all of the Regency Inn packages with complete price 
information, write to Regency Inn, Dept. MT, 8660 Irlo Bronson Memorial 
Parkway, Kissimmee, Fla. 32741, or call toll-free (800) 327-9129.

DICK TURPIN: LAS VEGAS POPULAR FOR SENIOR MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Turpin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inmigration to Southern California of people from the Pacific Rim, the 
Middle East and Central America during this decade has been so explosive that 
we've neglected statistics on movement within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Webb Corp., Phoenix-based pioneer in the business of housing for the 
active retired and senior citizens, has been carefully charting the growth of 
retiree migration within the nation. 
</P>
<P>
From 1960 to 1970, retirees departing from their respective states amounted to 
15% of the population and from 1970 to 1980 departures had increased by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers expect that by 1990, retirees having moved out of their resident 
states will number 4 million, representing the largest migration of seniors 
ever in American history. 
</P>
<P>
Which states have the most active movers, the most restless souls or the most 
adventurous seniors? Why do they leave their longtime homes? 
</P>
<P>
Webb's demographic studies show that the hottest spots of retiree migration are 
two East Coast states -- New York and New Jersey and at this point we'll resist 
any wiseacre guesses as to why New Yorkers or Jerseyites would want to leave 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But about 20% of those 60 and older move out of those respective states 
annually. Far fewer retirees leave the sunny states of California and Florida. 
Nine per cent of that age group has been leaving the Golden State and only 6% 
moves out of the Sunshine State. 
</P>
<P>
Don Tuffs, Webb's director of marketing, says seniors and retirees are 
attracted obviously to sunnier climes and to places in the sun where housing is 
still "affordable." 
</P>
<P>
To a great degree, that would exclude Southern California at this point but the 
same high-price factor is also the reason, he believes, that many "equity-rich" 
Californians -- having sold their long-occupied homes for excellent prices -- 
are cashing in on the fates of economy. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that at Webb's two Sun City projects in Arizona, about 25% of the 
newcomer buyers are from California. 
</P>
<P>
At its newly opened Sun City Summerlin, in Las Vegas, there is an added 
attraction to retirees and seniors who want to move away -- there is no 
personal income tax in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Droves of retirees are coming to Las Vegas which now has the fastest growing 
adult population in the U.S. Its major draw is among seniors from elsewhere in 
Nevada, from California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1985, Nevada's 65-and-older population grew by 41% while its 
age-50 and over population grew faster than any other segment of its 
population. One in every 6 residents -- or 118,000 persons -- in that gambling 
and entertainment capital today is over 50. 
</P>
<P>
And if the researchers are on target, the new wave of westward movement will 
continue into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared for that, last week Webb opened the aforementioned development, Sun 
City Summerlin in Las Vegas, covering 2,000 acres and planned to accommodate a 
population of 10,000 upon build-out in the immediate years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Webb's original active adult community, opened in 1960, is near Phoenix and has 
a population now of 46,000. Sun City West, also near Phoenix, opened in 1978, 
with a present population of 18,000 and expecting to reach the 25,000 mark by 
1993. Sun City Vistoso, near Tucson, opened in 1986, with a population of 800 
now and counting. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Bill Stout, our caustic TV colleague, has cited that intangible 
annual lure -- the Rose Bowl parade and game watched by millions -- as a magnet 
for cold and shivering easterners to pack up and head west. 
</P>
<P>
By his magical count, at least 10,000 of them do head west while millions think 
about it.

CONDO PURCHASE NEEDS EXTRA CARE; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE ENJOYMENT AND POTENTIAL PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of would-be buyers are shopping for condominiums instead of 
single-family homes, as prices for detached houses continue to climb and new 
tax laws encourage renters to become owners. 
</P>
<P>
But not all condominiums are created equal. Consumers who don't do their 
homework before buying a condo may find that they don't fully enjoy their new 
home and that their future resale profit will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
As with any type of purchase, experts say condo buyers should think of comfort 
first and potential profits second. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to remember is that you want to buy a place that 
you'll be happy and comfortable in," says Lou Piatt, executive vice president 
of Jon Douglas Co., one of Los Angeles' biggest brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Resale profits are important, but they should take a back seat to your life 
style requirements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attractive to Many Buyers 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, condos aren't for everyone. Most don't offer the privacy of 
single-family homes, and condo dwellers are "forced" to have more interaction 
with their neighbors because they share common walls, sidewalks, pools and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
But condominiums attract buyers for a variety of reasons, realtors say. They're 
usually much less expensive than houses in the same neighborhood, and each 
project's homeowners association -- not the individual owners -- usually 
perform most maintenance tasks. 
</P>
<P>
A condo buyer also usually gets more amenities -- pools, spas, 
recreation/fitness rooms, tennis courts and the like -- than he could afford by 
himself. "But it's important to determine whether you'll be able to use all 
those amenities," says Temmy Walker, president of the Studio City-based 
brokerage firm James R. Gary East. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a pool or tennis court is great, and it makes your condo more salable. 
But there's no reason to pay extra for a condo that has all those things if 
you'll never have time to use them." 
</P>
<P>
Picking a condo that will provide maximum enjoyment and maximum resale profit 
takes even more work. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the location of the property is paramount. The most promising 
prospects are in areas where the local economy is strong, schools are good, the 
transportation system is efficient, and shopping and other services are 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
It's also important to see how many other condo projects are in the area. 
Buying in an overbuilt condo market can mean a lower sales price, but it'll 
also mean lower resale profits if the unit must be sold before the glut goes 
away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Inspection Needed 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best condo prospects are often found in areas with a good mix of 
high-quality apartments and mid- to upper-priced single-family homes, experts 
say. A condo surrounded by low-quality apartments likely won't appreciate much 
because the neighborhood may be going downhill and future buyers will be hard 
to find. 
</P>
<P>
Once the consumer has narrowed the field of potential condo projects to three 
or four, it's time to take a closer look at each development. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make sure that all the common areas are being kept up," says 
Walker. "Make sure the landscaping is alive and well-tended, sidewalks are 
clean and in good repair, the pool's in good shape and the recreation room is 
useable and well-lit. 
</P>
<P>
"If the common areas are in bad shape, you're probably better off looking 
somewhere else," Walker says. "If the homeowners association hasn't been taking 
good care of the property, there's no reason to think they'll start doing a 
better job after you move in." 
</P>
<P>
Potential buyers should also try to attend at least one meeting of the 
project's homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to a meeting gives you an idea of what your neighbors would be like if 
you bought a place there," says Piatt at Jon Douglas. "And the way they solve 
their problems at the meeting helps you know whether everybody gets along, or 
if there's a lot of animosity." 
</P>
<P>
The issues addressed at the meeting can also yield important clues about the 
development itself. For example, if directors of the association discuss the 
project's rising crime rate or the need to make costly repairs, it may be best 
to look somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
It's also important to check out the association's financial records. This goes 
beyond determining how much the monthly homeowners dues will be: The 
association must have a strong balance sheet, with an adequate reserve to meet 
large expenses. 
</P>
<P>
If the association is in bad financial shape or doesn't have enough cash set 
aside to pay regular or unexpected bills, owners in the complex may see their 
monthly dues rise or get hit with a large "special assessment" to pay for 
repairs or maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers who don't feel qualified to determine the association's financial health 
can hire an accountant or other professional to review the group's books. 
Monthly fees and special assessments generally aren't tax deductible, unless 
the condo is being rented out to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to make an offer on a condo, make sure it's contingent on your 
satisfactory inspection of the financial records, bylaws, and everything else 
that can affect your pocketbook or the way you live," advises Walker. "That 
way, if you find something that you can't deal with, the sale won't have to go 
through." 
</P>
<P>
It's best to look for developments where at least 70% of the residents are 
owners, not renters, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"People who own their unit instead of rent it tend to take better care of their 
property," says Piatt. In addition, he says, absentee landlords may oppose 
making necessary repairs or improvements because the cost will hurt their 
bottom-line profits. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other reason why it's wise to select a development with a large 
majority of owner/occupants: Many lenders and government agencies refuse to 
make loans on units that are in projects with more than 20% or 30% renters. 
Others charge higher rates on such loans, which drives up the homeowner's 
monthly payments and makes the property less attractive to future buyers. 
</P>
<P>
If a buyer must choose between a two-bedroom unit or a one-bedroom for a bit 
less, it's usually best to stretch finances and choose the larger home. 
</P>
<P>
"A two-bedroom unit usually isn't much more expensive, but the extra bedroom 
really enhances its investment value because it'll appeal to a lot more 
(future) buyers," says Tom Cannon, senior vice president of the Grubb &amp; 
Ellis real estate office in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who are looking for one-bedroom units are singles, or a few 
married people with no kids." 
</P>
<P>
Realtor Piatt urges would-be condo buyers to look for units with many of the 
most sought-after features in single-family homes: Relatively large rooms, tile 
instead of linoleum flooring, a good floor plan and "extras" such as vaulted or 
beamed ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
"The high-quality condos tend to have better appreciation potential," he says. 
"And they're nicer to live in, while you're still there."

<P>
'PINWHEEL' LAND PLAN SQUEEZES MORE HOUSES ON SITE 
</P>

<P>
A land-planning concept that would seem to have everything going for it puts 
new life into the old cul-de-sac by yielding more houses per acre, minimizing 
the impact of cars, increasing the size of the rear yard and slashing 
development costs. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Stewart Woodard of Stewart Woodard &amp; Associates, A.I.A., Costa 
Mesa, believes that his so-called circular motor court layout has so many 
advantages over the traditional linear tract layout that it's only a matter of 
time before it replaces the much more common linear layout. 
</P>
<P>
"In the seven projects involving more than 2,000 housing units that we've 
designed for Orange County builders, we've achieved a 30% to 50% reduction in 
roads, doubled the amount of open space and doubled the amount of rear yard 
space -- all while getting as much as 12 detached houses on an acre of land," 
he said. "A big advantage of the circular motor court plan is that it works 
especially well on hilly sites. Increasingly, hilly land is all that is 
available for development in many communities." 
</P>
<P>
The circular layout accommodates apartments, townhouses and detached houses or 
-- in the case of the 64.3-acre Canyon Hills in the Laguna Canyon area of 
Laguna Beach -- a combination of all three in one 681-unit development that 
garnered a 1986 Gold Nugget Award from the Pacific Coast Builders Conference 
for the Woodard firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. Canyon Hills development manages to 
accommodate 108 2-3-bedroom detached houses in a tract called California Cove, 
along with 573 attached units built by other developers. The price range of the 
detached houses was $146,000-$162,000 when the project opened in 1985, 
according to a K&amp;B spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard used a similar configuration for K&amp;B's California Terrace 95-unit 
detached development in Phillips Ranch near Diamond Bar. The 2-3-bedroom, 
1,100-1,590-square-foot houses went on sale in May, 1987, in the 
$123,000-$159,000 range, according to the spokeswoman, Elene L. Davidson, and 
were sold out by March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of the pinwheel design is the bigger back yard compared with 
traditional linear layouts, along with getting more units on the same amount of 
land," she said. "One disadvantage is the streetscape is dominated by garage 
doors, due to the pie-shaped lots with the narrow end facing the street." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to designing houses and tracts for K&amp;B, Woodard has designed 
motor court projects for such Southland builders as Sterling Homes, Ponderosa 
Homes, Urban West Development Co., M.D. Janes Co. and Hardage Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also designed a half dozen projects with more than 1,000 units in such 
Florida communities as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and Orlando," Woodard 
said. "Florida builders face some of the same problems as those in California." 
</P>
<P>
The California dream for home buyers is a detached house on its own lot; to 
achieve this dream, California builders must squeeze as many houses on as small 
a parcel of typically expensive land as possible. The lots average about 3,500 
square feet at the Laguna Beach K&amp;B development and are bigger -- 4,500 
square feet -- at the Phillips Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Walt Richardson of Richardson Nagy Martin in Newport Beach said that 
the typical 7,500-square-foot lot of only a few years ago is now considered a 
pad size for a half-million-dollar-plus move-up house. Most lots are now well 
under 6,000 feet, with 3,600-3,800-square-foot lots typical in such new 
developments as the Irvine Co.'s Westpark in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first modern suburban uses of smaller lots was University Park in 
Irvine, where 5,000-square-foot lots were used two decades ago," Richardson 
said. His firm won a Gold Nugget Award in 1987 from the Pacific Coast Builders 
Conference for the 4,500-unit Westpark site plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only in California, but elsewhere in the nation, the ongoing problem for 
architects, planners and builders is putting a fairly big house -- 2,000 square 
feet or even larger -- on a small lot," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
He outlined the problems and solutions in the February, 1988, issue of Urban 
Land magazine, published by the Urban Land Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The Z-lot plan, so called because it has "Z" jogs in the lot lines for 
easements, gives an extra five feet or so to the front elevation of the house, 
allowing a front entry and diminishing the influence of the garage door, 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Z-lots were used by Richardson's firm for Promenade by J.M. Peters Co., a 
170-house development in Westpark. It works out to a density of 7.75 units per 
acre with 3,780 square foot (42-by-90-feet) lots. 
</P>
<P>
For the Casa del Cielo project by Meister Development Group of Phoenix, 
Richardson's firm produced an angled Z-lot plan -- with both the lot and the 
house at an angle to the street -- to further minimize the driveways and garage 
doors. The 150-unit development was completed in 1985 in Scottsdale, a Phoenix 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
A third popular lot configuration is the wide-shallow lot, typically 55 to 70 
feet wide, but only 55 to 70 feet deep rather than the more common 100 to 150, 
Richardson said. Unless a lot is at least 70 feet deep, however, the 
wide-shallow configuration yields a too-small back yard, especially since 
virtually all houses being built on small lots have two stories, he added.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: DESIGN AWARDS HAVE SOME VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few weeks go by in the design community without some sort of an award program 
or other. Last week, it was the chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts 
traveling to Pasadena to hand out the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence 
to regional winners, having already announced the awards a few months ago at 
ceremonies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This week Progressive Architecture (PA) magazine is scheduled to disclose the 
winners of its coveted annual awards program in the categories of architectural 
design, urban design and planning, and applied research, with California 
practitioners as usual expected to garner more than their share. 
</P>
<P>
Bestowing honors in December was the Society of American Registered Architects, 
the Southern California chapter of the American Society of Landscape 
Architects, and Architectural Record magazine, the latter in a new, highly 
touted awards program entitled "In the Public Interest." 
</P>
<P>
And scheduled over the next few months are the awards ceremonies of the San 
Fernando Valley and California chapters, among others, of the American 
Institute of Architects, culminating with the institute's national awards in 
May. Also on tap is the bi-annual Rudy Brunner Award for Urban Excellence and 
the tri-annual Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
I have generally viewed many of the awards programs with a certain reticence. 
Too often, juries have appeared predisposed and doctrinaire, influenced by peer 
pressure, passing fads, flashy photography, and heavily promoted personalities 
easily identified by signature styles. (Except sometimes to the embarrassment 
of the juries, it is hard to tell the masters from the mimics.) Such self 
congratulatory exercises can become a bore. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I have found most awards programs to be of value, presenting as they do 
glimpses of the shifting styles and prejudices of the design profession in 
select geographic areas and project categories. When sitting at the design 
table it is instructive to know what deck the players are dealing from, and if 
jokers are wild. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally gems are uncovered. This usually happens when juries in fits 
of independent intelligence judge submissions based on a critical matrix of 
substantive architectural issues, such as social, contextual and structure, 
instead of trying to pigeonhole them according to the shifting superficial 
styles sanctified by a Charles Jencks, a Robert A.M. Stern, or a similar 
pedant. 
</P>
<P>
Award programs also have the potential when properly focused, conducted and 
publicized to heighten public and professional awareness of the potential of 
good design. In addition, by honoring such efforts others involved in a 
particular design process might be encouraged to emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
Given this potential, and the general low level of publicly funded design, I 
feel the Presidential Awards program deserves special mention. Presented every 
four years, the program honors designs in a variety of federally sponsored 
projects, including architecture, landscape design, planning and historic 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the Design Excellence list was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the 
Washington Mall, including both the expressive, intersecting black granite 
walls designed by Maya Ying Lin, and the accompanying realistic sculpture of 
three soldiers by Frederick Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included the urban design of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, 
the planning of a transit project in Boston, and the engineering of a bridge in 
Florida. (Of the 10 top awards, only one -- in Arkansas -- was west of the 
Mississippi, indicating once again what I feel is a distinct East Coast 
prejudice of Washington-based programs. But that is another topic for another 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
Locally, one of the 68 national Achievement Awards went to the adaptive reuse 
of the former hotel overlooking the Arroyo Seco south of Colorado Boulevard as 
a federal court and office building. Architects for the imaginative effort that 
preserved the landmark was the Pasadena firm of Neptune &amp; Thomas 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Also winning an Achievement Award was the renovation of a dated, deteriorated 
bungalow at 2303 Fifth St. in the Ocean Park area of Santa Monica into a 
desirable apartment complex. It was accomplished by the determined non-profit 
Community Corp. of Santa Monica and the resourceful architecture of the local 
firm of Fondi-Bonardi &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
In bestowing a bevy of awards, the jury for the Southern California chapter of 
the American Society of Landscape Architects made the provocative point that 
the profession's focus was in flux. It declared that "while the variety of 
projects receiving awards reflected the landscape architect's broad ability to 
successfully design for any location, the real challenge is to create more 
'livable' urban spaces designed with people in mind." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate its point, the jury gave an Award of Excellence to the Santa 
Monica firm of Campbell &amp; Campbell for its design of the pier area of 
Imperial Beach. It was noted that the design featuring the conversion of a 
derelict parking lot into a landscaped plaza was developed with the intense 
participation of local residents, in design jargon, the potential user. 
</P>
<P>
Other landscape architecture winners included Dike/Runa of Newport Beach for 
the Hidden Oaks Ranch in Valley Center, and the SWA Group of Laguna Beach for 
the Baywood Apartment complex in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This recognition of the "user" is heartening. And while few actual "users," the 
person or persons a project is specifically designed for, are ever invited onto 
the juries of the various associations conducting awards program, they are, of 
course, the ultimate jurors, passing judgment daily on the projects experienced 
in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, we are all jurors, and design critics. 
</P>

HOME IMPROVEMENT: REMODELED KITCHEN IS HOME'S 'THEME' ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dale Baldwin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Architect R. Mark Fuote of Arkineto Architects, Venice, calls the kitchen in 
the Hamaguchi house on the Westside the "theme" room of the much-remodeled 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Fuote designed the kitchen to be the focal point of the extensive interior 
remodeling (all he'll say is it cost more than $100,000) job he designed for 
the house on a quiet street between busy Sunset and San Vicente boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
All of the original 1940s-style cabinets and the sink were removed and 
custom-design, white-painted cabinets were installed, along with granite 
counter tops. The European-look cabinets were built by Mike Beeman of M &amp; B 
Cabinets, Santa Fe Springs -- a craftsman whose workmanship meets Fuote's 
demanding standards. (The Miami-born architect studied and/or practiced 
architecture in Italy, West Germany and England.) 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the function of the kitchen as a focal point of the house, 
computer desks and a peninsula base cabinet were part of the built-in cabinets, 
along with a dining banquette. This kitchen brings to mind the real "country 
kitchens" of the Midwest, along with the sophistication that one would expect 
of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the kitchen that takes it far beyond the ordinary is a 
spectacular curved three-dimensional ceiling plan with three plastic skylights 
at the apex 20 feet above the floor. Still more light is funneled into the room 
through a greenhouse window behind the sinks. 
</P>
<P>
Fuote insists on custom-designed greenhouse windows, skylights and cabinets for 
a job of this magnitude: "All too many remodels have the appearance of being 
put together from stock units purchased at a home center and thrown together in 
an ad hoc manner." 
</P>
<P>
A large bathroom that served the downstairs bedrooms was gutted and turned into 
a modern bathroom and powder room, occupying the same space. A housekeeper's 
room and bath was added to the rear of the house, blending in with the previous 
exterior expansion and remodeling, which was designed by another architect.

Responding to complaints that residents sometimes don't know that a new 
development is planned for their area until the bulldozers show up, city 
officials are devising guidelines that would greatly increase the number of 
people who receive official notice of a proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission last week expressed general support of a proposed 
expansion of zoning-related public notice requirements, although the commission 
will not vote on the matter until next month. 
</P>
<P>
As regulations now stand, property owners within 300 feet of a proposed 
development site are given notice of Planning Commission hearings on the 
project. The commission is considering extending that to 500 feet and notifying 
renters as well as property owners, among other changes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Revisions 
</P>
<P>
Just extending the distance to 500 feet would quadruple the number of notices 
sent out from about 50 to 200, according to a planning staff report. Other 
revisions would further boost the number of notices -- all at a cost that would 
be borne by the developer, who has to pay for the mailings. 
</P>
<P>
A surge in residential and commercial construction in recent years has roused 
neighborhood groups, who have argued that expanded notice requirements would 
help them keep abreast of what is going on in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is an issue of citizen participation," said Belmont Heights 
community activist Stanley Green, one of several who appealed to the 
commissioners to add commercial and residential tenants to notice lists. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to consider people's rights, not just property rights," said Dan 
Rosenberg, a persistent critic of the city's apartment growth. 
</P>
<P>
The commission asked staff to return in a month with an evaluation of 
suggestions by Commissioner Pat Schauer. She proposed that hearing schedules be 
announced on the local public service cable TV channel, that the city run 
weekly notice advertisements in the Press-Telegram, notify renters as well as 
property owners, and devise a system whereby the required notice distance would 
vary according to the scale of a project. Large projects would require more 
extensive distribution of notices than small ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day-Care Facility 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the commission for the first time required a developer to open 
a day-care facility in his proposed building as a condition of approval. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care facility was part of a package of extras suggested by the 
developer in return for permission to add more residential units to his 
commercial-condominium complex than normally permitted under the city's zoning 
laws, said Planning Director Robert J. Paternoster. 
</P>
<P>
Although a first, Paternoster said the day-care requirement was not an 
indication of a new city policy. "We wouldn't have done it if he hadn't offered 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project, slated for the 800 block of Pine Avenue, would include 72 
condominiums and 12,000 feet of commercial space. The commission has not taken 
final action on the development, but approved several conditions, including one 
that the developer lease space in the commercial portion of his building for 
operation of a preschool day-care center.

CUSTODIAN TRANSFORMS STUDENTS INTO STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Custodian Hector Pena had it up to here with problem kids who vandalized the 
bathrooms at Fern Elementary School every day. 
</P>
<P>
His solution -- to have the troublemakers star in their own show -- was new to 
teachers and administrators, who thought they had tried everything. And it 
certainly was an innovative approach to custodial work. 
</P>
<P>
Now, three years and several student talent shows later, Pena has become a 
highly appreciated producer of dazzling entertainment at the school in 
Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
The girls in that first show -- whose ringleader proved to be "a great little 
rocker with real talent," Pena said -- graduated and did well in intermediate 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidante, Leader 
</P>
<P>
The vandalism ended then, but Pena has continued to produce about three shows a 
year. Performers have included low achievers who need some kind of success, as 
well as good students who just want to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 38, has taken on the unpaid roles of confidante, problem-solver, music 
teacher, youth leader, service club director and PTA officer. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of school, Pena said, he is a part-time professional percussionist who 
plays with a variety of groups and for studio shows. He also knows how to use 
sound and light equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Hector's job title might not be teacher, but he does teach all the time," said 
Randy Knight, a special education teacher at Fern Intermediate School, which 
adjoins the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Knight remembers the ringleader of the first group Pena worked with as a 
special education student in his class, when he taught the sixth grade. "She 
didn't have any friends and was kind of looked down on," he recalled. But after 
that first show, Knight said, "Boy, all of a sudden she was popular and 
everyone wanted to sit next to her. She got her little limelight." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said: "That's all she needed, just a little. And she took off from there." 
</P>
<P>
The girls had been "taking their anger out on the school," he said. "I guess 
they had knocked on every door and I was the last door." 
</P>
<P>
Pena had already been assisting with entertainment at the school and several of 
the girls who had caused the mischief told him of their interest in performing. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted their own music, and I said, 'OK, come in here (the cafeteria) 
during recess and let's see.' They did and I said, 'Wow! I know we got 
something here!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show a Success 
</P>
<P>
The show, presented on the last day of school that June, was such a success 
that students were dancing in the aisles and teachers asked for a second 
performance, said Knight and Jim Dugdale, a sixth-grade teacher who also 
teaches music and works with Pena and Knight on the student shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have kept those girls. I would have thrown them out," said Dugdale, 
"But Hector has so much more patience than anyone else. He pulled them 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since that first show, pupils have made up their own acts and auditioned 
for Pena's approval in little groups, singing and dancing along with popular 
records and tapes. They rehearse during recesses and lunch periods for up to 
three months. The shows are presented at student assemblies. Pena, Knight and 
Dugdale provide special sound effects, scenery andlighting. Pena said his 
volunteer work stems from a lifelong interest in youngsters, and his knowledge 
of music helps him to help them. 
</P>
<P>
He understands a child's mental processes enough to know that bathroom 
vandalism and other anti-social behavior are sometimes directly related to 
personal problems, including academic failure. Children who act in a 
destructive manner often have no one to talk to and need attention and 
encouragement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just care a lot about these kids," he said. "They're here every day. 
Somebody's gotta pay attention to them. Somebody's gotta communicate with them, 
help them to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like that big heart is right there and you ask -- how close can you get 
to that? That's what I ask myself every day." 
</P>
<P>
Pena began working for the Garvey School District at Fern School in 1981. While 
continuing his regular workload, he volunteered to help Dugdale, who is blind, 
with student Christmas shows. 
</P>
<P>
When the first group of students asked Pena to help them perform in 1986, he 
said, he got Principal Joyce Metevia's permission to coach them during recesses 
in the school cafeteria, which has a stage and doubles as an assembly hall. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is often simultaneously pushing a dust mop and calling out advice from the 
back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Communicate with your hands," he'll call out. Or, "Use the whole stage, not 
just a little spot," or "Looks good! Looks good!" 
</P>
<P>
Students say the performances give them confidence that helps them in the 
classroom. While some have academic problems, Pena said others are good 
students who just want to sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started in December and already I feel better," said Jaime Sellers, a 
sixth-grader. "I was kind of embarrassed auditioning in front of three people, 
and now it's OK in front of 10." 
</P>
<P>
Jaime is in a group rehearsing to perform Tiffany's hit song, "I Think We're 
Alone Now." 
</P>
<P>
She may grow up to sing and dance, she said, "because everybody is so nice and 
smiling and clapping after, and telling you that's great. And Hector's always 
telling you nice things about it. I don't even think he's a grown-up, he's so 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Angel, 10, a fifth grader, said Pena helped him with a special "rap" on 
drugs that he performed last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's different from other adults -- he helps us out with difficulties," said 
Oscar Rodriguez, 11, another sixth-grader whose group pantomimes a tape by New 
Kids on the Block, "Please Don't Go, Girl." 
</P>
<P>
"I think in many instances Hector has helped children with achievements outside 
of the classroom," said Principal Metevia. "The shows are good, and it's rather 
prestigious for children to be in them. I think it is rather rare that a 
custodian would put so much extra time like this." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he grew up in a large family in a housing project in East Los 
Angeles, where one particular friend stands out as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
"His name was Alfred, and he taught the kids how to dance and to play a little 
football. He was much older, but he liked us and we liked hanging around him. 
He would get teams together and help us express ourselves. It helped a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more or less how I'm carrying myself, through his example." 
</P>
<P>
To be an example, Pena said he "would not dare" to smoke or even talk about 
drinking anything alcoholic, nor will he allow the children to use dirty 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is married and has two stepchildren, aged 20 and 13. He lives near Fern 
School, and Knight and Dugdale said he often drops by on weekends to check on 
the school. He has also organized a club, Service Cubs, made up of Fern 
students who qualify for membership with good grades and volunteer service. 
They help at the school with such chores as setting up equipment before shows, 
gardening, and assisting kindergarten children in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Pena is also historian for the Fern School PTA, which pays for the Service 
Cubs' jackets and for special outings. Pena said he rewards the Service Cubs 
and volunteer students with these special treats, "because kids should always 
be rewarded." 
</P>
<P>
In a school with 550 pupils, Pena said, "all of them have something unique to 
give or to express. I like to express myself as a friend, someone they can 
trust. If they get hurt or lost or whatever, they can come to me and maybe I 
can help them solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm here. Thank God for schools."

STUDY PREDICTS TRAFFIC JAM IN GRAND AVENUE EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The worst fears of residents' groups have been confirmed by a study released by 
San Bernardino County officials that predicts serious traffic congestion 
resulting from the scheduled extension of Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Avenue extension, which San Bernardino County officials hope to have 
open by April, will provide a direct route to the Orange and Pomona freeways 
from the rapidly growing but isolated community of Chino Hills. The extension 
has angered neighboring Diamond Bar residents, who believe it will exacerbate 
traffic problems in their community. 
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared for the county by Kunzman Associates, a traffic engineering 
firm, projects that as a result of the extension, traffic on Grand Avenue in 
central Diamond Bar will reach 38,100 vehicles a day in 1991, 127% of the 
road's designated capacity. Without the extension, the report states, 12,000 
fewer vehicles would use the same stretch of road daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard to Swallow' 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipated it would be bad, but it's hard to swallow when you see it in 
black and white," said Gary Miller, founder of Concerned Citizens for Diamond 
Bar Traffic Control, a watchdog group concerned with the impact of the Grand 
Avenue extension. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lawson, founder of the Stop Grand Avenue Expressway Committee, a more 
militant citizens group, said the study's finding should bolster residents' 
efforts to prevent the extension's opening. 
</P>
<P>
"It says exactly what we thought it was going to say: (the extension) is just 
going to ruin Diamond Bar," Lawson said. "It adds fuel to the fire as far as 
I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic from Chino Hills can be expected to worsen, the report states, as the 
number of homes in the community grows from today's 9,500 to almost 23,000 by 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in traffic congestion in Diamond Bar could be mitigated, the study 
states, by the addition of four traffic signals, the expansion of Grand Avenue 
and a section of Diamond Bar Boulevard to six lanes, and the creation of 
additional left-turn-only lanes at major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with these improvements, traffic on Grand Avenue between Diamond Bar 
Boulevard and Golden Springs Road would still exceed the road's capacity by 5%, 
with 47,100 vehicles a day expected by 1996, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
"The mitigation measures are so inadequate, it's ridiculous," Lawson said. 
"It's going to devastate Diamond Bar, there's no other word for it. Property 
values throughout south Diamond Bar will be jeopardized. . . . The health and 
safety of Diamond Bar citizens will be jeopardized." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said his group, in conjunction with a Chino Hills residents group 
concerned with traffic and excessive growth in that community, has consulted an 
attorney and plans to file suit against San Bernardino County to stop all 
development in Chino Hills and block the Grand Avenue extension. 
</P>
<P>
The group would prefer to avoid a costly legal action, Lawson said, but this 
would only be possible if Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum uses his 
authority to block the extension's opening. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was recently appointed by Schabarum to fill a vacancy on the 
Diamond Bar Municipal Advisory Council, said stopping the extension is not a 
realistic option. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no legal way to stop Grand Avenue from going through," Miller said, 
noting that the extension has been included in plans for the region for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the only way to minimize the adverse effects of the extension is 
for Schabarum to require stringent enforcement of an agreement that he said 
exists between the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resolution Passed in June 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is contained in a resolution passed last June by the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors granting San Bernardino County approval to 
construct a section of the Chino Hills Parkway-Phillips Ranch Road project in 
northeastern Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of its approval, the board stipulated that San Bernardino County 
officials complete the Chino Hills Parkway-Phillips Ranch Road project before 
opening the Grand Avenue extension. The board also required that San Bernardino 
County commission a traffic study to determine what type of measures to 
mitigate traffic in Diamond Bar and have those improvements finished before 
traffic can roll on Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Schabarum has to hold (San Bernardino County Supervisor Larry) Walker to that 
agreement, and those (mitigation) measures have to be implemented before Grand 
Avenue opens," Miller said. "I have every reason to believe that he will make 
them abide by this agreement. I would be really surprised if he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum considers the resolution to be a binding agreement between the two 
counties and plans to enforce it, said his press deputy, Judy Hammond. However, 
Walker said that the promised mitigation measures will not be completed by 
Grand Avenue's scheduled opening in March and that he has no intention of 
allowing the completed extension to go unused. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't be in the position of spending $12 million to build a road and 
not being able to open it when there's such a pressing need," Walker said. "It 
is the opinion of our attorney, and of the Los Angeles County counsel, that 
there is nothing that can be done legally to stop the opening of Grand Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said Chino Hills Parkway and the various street improvements in Diamond 
Bar would be ready "within a very few months" of the opening of Grand Avenue. 
San Bernardino County has already set aside $400,000 to build improvements to 
help alleviate increased traffic in Diamond Bar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're acting totally in good faith," Walker said. "We've got major dollars set 
aside to build those roads, and we're going to build them just as fast it can 
physically be accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Going to Be a Funnel' 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect does not gladden Diamond Bar residents such as Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"If that road opens up without those measures, I might as well forget going to 
work in the morning," Miller said. "If (the measures) don't go in, it's going 
to be a funnel (of traffic) right into Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to be unreasonable with Chino Hills," he added. "I feel for 
those people. I don't like to see them with that problem. But I don't want that 
problem put in Diamond Bar." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he also is trying to be sympathetic to the plight of Diamond Bar 
residents, but added, "It will be worse for Chino Hills if that road doesn't 
open than it will for Diamond Bar if does."

SATURDAY SCHOOL GIVES CLASS-CUTTERS A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Mitchell didn't sell any chocolate bars or booster pennants, but he 
recently made some money for his high school -- by going to class on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
School on Saturday, an Arcadia High School program that requires truants to 
make up hours for missed classes, is designed to help the high school recoup 
state money lost when a student skips school. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, 18, was in Saturday school because he had ditched classes one day to 
visit his girlfriend in Riverside. He worked on an English assignment, plowing 
through 200 pages of Ernest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Attendance 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had it during finals," Mitchell said of the mandatory four-hour study 
period. 
</P>
<P>
For every Saturday class a student attends, the school receives $15.88 from the 
state, said Tom Payne, assistant principal in charge of student activities and 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of state money a school district receives is based on the schools' 
average daily attendance, or ADA. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988-89 school year, $22 million of the Arcadia Unified School 
District's $28-million budget will come from ADA, said C. Earl Davis, assistant 
superintendent in charge of business services. 
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of the 1987-88 school year alone, truancy cost the 
high school $50,000 in state money, said Davis. During the same two-month 
period this school year, the loss was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's figure includes money lost due to unexcused absences in the days 
after the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
School on Saturday programs have been adopted elsewhere, including Alta Loma 
High School, the El Rancho Unified School District and the Whittier Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tougher Policy 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia instituted the program this school year as part of an effort to toughen 
its truancy policy and recoup state subsidies for attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"Absenteeism was increasing; truancy was increasing," Payne said. "We could see 
a trend." 
</P>
<P>
The program, started in October, is reserved for students who have missed at 
least a full day of school. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, they must attend one Saturday school class for every day of school 
they missed, but Payne said no student has been asked to attend more than four 
consecutive Saturday sessions. Some truants have ditched a week or more of 
school, he said, and there are not enough Saturday sessions in the school year 
for all of them to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday school classes are not held on holiday weekends or on days when 
college entrance examinations are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The program, Payne added, isn't intended to "do the student in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Apache Lotto' 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Saturday school, Arcadia High has started an "Apache Lotto" game 
in which students selected at random each week can win $5 or more if they did 
not miss class the two previous days. 
</P>
<P>
If the winners did miss class, the money is rolled over to the following week's 
drawing, said Payne. So far, the largest jackpot was $15. 
</P>
<P>
Money for the game comes from the student government. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, truants were sent to Saturday Work Detail, where they joined 
students sent there for breaking school rules such as smoking or fighting. 
Students on work detail must do chores such as picking up trash on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The number of students required to report for work detail hit a high of 120 on 
some Saturdays, said Payne. The school, which has 2,000 students, did not 
recover any state money by sending truants to work detail. 
</P>
<P>
One recent Saturday, seven students dragged themselves out of bed early to 
attend the 8 a.m.-to-noon School on Saturday classes. Those who ditch Saturday 
school face suspension, said Payne. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere down the road, they can be transferred to an alternative school," 
said Payne. "It's not in their best interest to be suspended." 
</P>
<P>
The night before, a school employee telephoned each student's home to leave a 
message about the consequences of failing to attend. 
</P>
<P>
For Mike Messina, 15, getting that call ended his technique of hanging up on 
the computerized telephone calls the school makes to possible truants. The 
calls, featuring Payne's voice, are made between 5:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. after 
a student has missed three or more classes. 
</P>
<P>
The computer makes 275 to 300 calls a day, Payne said. If anyone answers the 
phone, the computer registers "message received." 
</P>
<P>
"I intercepted all the calls from the school," said Messina, a sophomore who 
recently ditched a week and a half of school. "I had it planned so perfect." 
</P>
<P>
But the system caught up with him when the school employee made a live call. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday school a few weeks ago, Messina and six fellow truants, including 
Mitchell, sat quietly reading or doing homework. An adult proctor made sure 
they stayed. If students run out of homework, proctors give them work sheets 
covering subjects such as math or history. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had to use (the work sheets) yet," said Michael Simuniello, a 
fourth-grade teacher who works as a proctor. 
</P>
<P>
At the first Saturday school class Simuniello supervised, he found one of his 
former fourth-grade students on the roll. 
</P>
<P>
"He just walked in and smiled at me and went about his work," Simuniello said 
of the 17-year-old. "He was probably my hardest worker that day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automatic Flunking 
</P>
<P>
Under the new, tougher truancy policy, students who skip school four times in a 
quarter automatically fail the course. In semester courses, six unexcused 
absences mean mandatory failure. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he feels the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, you could get away with two or three (absences) and not get 
caught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In regular class, teachers are emphasizing attendance by giving more pop 
quizzes or in-class assignments that truants are not allowed to make up, thus 
hurting their grades. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's working marvelously," Payne said of the new truancy policy and 
incentive programs. He said attendance on selected days this year has been 
12%-13% higher than it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Most students in Saturday school didn't mind being required to study. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only four hours," said Nick Cazier, a 17-year-old senior. "The problem is 
getting up at 7:30. That's a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said Saturday school is scheduled early for just that reason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts Into Job 
</P>
<P>
For Karen Becker, 16, the biggest deterrent is that Saturday school cuts into 
her part-time job at an interior decorating store. She said she had to ask her 
boss for time off in order to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said she started ditching classes last year because she felt intimidated 
by high school. Recently, she said, she missed two days of school because she 
was sick. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother didn't want to give me a note because she didn't believe me," said 
Becker. But she is less tempted to skip school now, she said, especially 
because her mother has promised her a car if she stops ditching classes. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday school was productive for Messina. "I just used the time to read my 
"Huckleberry Finn" book," he said. Reading the novel for English class, sitting 
with his cap cocked backward, he seemed to share the carefree spirit of the 
Mark Twain character. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rather Be at Beach 
</P>
<P>
Cazier polished off an assignment that wouldn't be due for four days and began 
tackling "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Despite all the work he got done, 
though, he said he would rather not have to go to Saturday school. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have wanted to go to the beach today," said Cazier, who had skipped 
classes to go surfing. "Now that I look back on it, it's not worth it. Instead 
of going that day, I could have gone today." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kim, a 17-year-old junior, reported for Saturday school with his buddies 
in tow. Michael Lee, 17, wasn't required to attend, but he showed up with 
homework of his own to keep Kim company. 
</P>
<P>
Another friend, San Han, 17, arrived later and stood outside the classroom 
waiting for Kim and Lee. During breaks, the three chatted in a huddle. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Chyan, 18, also sat outside, waiting patiently for his girlfriend to 
finish Saturday school. "It's my fault," Chyan said, glancing toward the 
classroom. He said he had caused her to miss school. 
</P>
<P>
Chyan said he tried to make up by giving her flowers but wasn't sure if that 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
As for Eric Mitchell, school on Saturday has dampened his desire to play hooky, 
but not completely. 
</P>
<P>
"You just got to be more careful," he said.

WORKER BLOWS WHISTLE ON ASBESTOS IN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incident that forever changed Jerry Snell arrived without warning in a 
cloud of white asbestos dust six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred as Snell, a maintenance worker at Metropolitan State Hospital, was 
changing covers on large presses used to iron sheets and pillowcases. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to uncrate one of the new covers," he recalled recently. "I pulled 
it out, and the white stuff went everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
As nearby fans blew the asbestos fibers throughout the hospital's laundry, a 
worried Snell called his supervisors, who evacuated the building. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was reprimanded by Cal/OSHA for not notifying the worker safety 
agency that asbestos was to be handled by employees. And Snell, imbued with a 
new awareness of asbestos hazards, was transformed into a whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
"That started the crusade," Snell, 42, said of his six-year effort to identify 
asbestos hazards at the Norwalk hospital and to protect maintenance workers 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
Snell's behind-the-scenes crusade -- waged mostly through conversations with 
other workers and repeated complaints to his union and his supervisors -- may 
have peaked in November, when Cal/OSHA cited the hospital for six violations of 
worker safety law. Acting on complaints by Snell and a second employee, 
investigators found crumbling, dangerous asbestos insulation in equipment rooms 
and crawl spaces of 20 of the facility's 76 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the 1983 laundry incident, the 1,500-employee psychiatric 
hospital has received a total of 16 citations on five occasions for 
asbestos-related problems, according to state documents. 
</P>
<P>
That record, say spokesmen for two unions representing about 50 maintenance and 
craft employees at the hospital, has identified Metropolitan as one of a 
handful of state facilities in Southern California whose asbestos problems 
require special union attention. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenters, plumbers, electricians, sheet-metal and heating-system workers are 
the employees whose jobs regularly place them in false ceilings, attics and 
basements -- the types of non-public places where frayed, brittle asbestos 
insulation has now been found. Hospital officials say there is no evidence that 
asbestos has posed a threat to patients or the public. 
</P>
<P>
Crumbling asbestos is extremely dangerous because its microscopic fibers can 
flake into the air and can be inhaled, creating a risk of lung cancer or other 
respiratory diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Several hospital workers said in interviews that they consider the recent 
Cal/OSHA citations strong evidence that hospital administrators are not 
concerned enough about asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Citations 
</P>
<P>
"Where will (they) be in 15 years when I get lung cancer?" said maintenance 
worker Ralph Portugal. In August, Portugal said, he and two other workers 
ripped out a ceiling after a supervisor told them it contained no asbestos. But 
Cal/OSHA tests later showed that asbestos was present, and the agency issued 
three citations against the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The three workers involved in the job said none of them wore respirators or 
protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan administrators said procedures were followed during the August 
incident and defended their worker safety programs in general, saying they are 
extremely sensitive to complaints about possible asbestos exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"As we run into asbestos, we follow all the procedures. We constantly work with 
the unions. We don't put our employees at risk," William Silva, executive 
director at Metropolitan since 1987, said after the Cal/OSHA citations were 
issued in November. 
</P>
<P>
Silva said the hospital has identified asbestos hazards since at least 1982, 
when it began a $20-million rehabilitation of its buildings, all of which were 
built between 1916 and 1955. As in many public and private buildings erected 
before the 1980s, asbestos was used routinely as an insulator and fire 
retardant at Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators have declined to answer specific questions about past 
incidents, saying that some supervisors involved have left the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Several maintenance workers who were otherwise critical of the hospital's 
response to asbestos problems, acknowledged in interviews that the hospital has 
become more responsive in the last year or two with a change in some 
supervisors and administrators. Stricter state and federal regulations have 
also increased the awareness of asbestos hazards, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Snell -- a union steward who said he was twice threatened with dismissal 
in 1986 because of asbestos complaints and was twice exiled to the hospital's 
boiler room -- sees improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems with current management," Snell said, "but I see light at the 
end of the tunnel. We have a workable relationship." 
</P>
<P>
That has not always been the case, Snell and several of his co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Big Lie' 
</P>
<P>
Jim Failing, a steward for the Alliance of Trades and Maintenance, a union of 
state crafts workers and laborers, said, "The big lie for 10 years, and I don't 
know how many times I've heard it, was that there is no asbestos problem at 
Metropolitan State Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Snell said his own experiences over the years show that supervisors have 
sometimes failed to adequately respond to known asbestos hazards and to dangers 
that could have been identified readily. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1983 laundry incident, for example, Snell said he told supervisors 
that he often encountered deteriorated asbestos in the hospital's mechanical 
rooms, where it insulated pipes and machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators responded to Snell's requests for more protective 
clothing and complete asbestos removal by saying that they were following all 
worker-protection laws. Costly asbestos removal, they said in letters to Snell, 
was being addressed by the Department of Mental Health on a statewide basis, 
depending on the severity of the hazard. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that a September, 1983, hospital test monitored by Cal/OSHA 
showed that maintenance workers performing a variety of jobs in the presence of 
brittle asbestos were not exposed to amounts that exceeded levels where special 
protection of workers is required. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Snell complained through his union about brittle asbestos in the 
boiler room, where he had been assigned for a year. A hospital manager 
acknowledged the problem in a letter to Snell, but the crumbling asbestos was 
not covered with a protective glue-like coating until 14 months later, 
according to Snell and hospital documents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, in what Snell described as an act of "utter frustration," he painted 
red arrows on pipes in a number of buildings to identify asbestos hazards. 
Supervisors cited him for misconduct, Snell said, explaining that the arrows 
were a hazard because they might be confused with those that indicate the flow 
of hot water and steam, causing accidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Crawl Spaces 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Snell and Failing called Cal/OSHA last July with complaints 
about asbestos debris in crawl spaces beneath several buildings. The inquiry 
that followed prompted a Cal/OSHA investigator to close off crawl spaces and 
equipment rooms in 20 aging hospital buildings where debris was found. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't even have to go under most of those buildings," Snell said. "You 
could just shine a flashlight on it. It's there for anybody to see. That's been 
the frustrating thing." 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA, responding to those hazards and other safety problems including black 
widow spiders and exposed electrical wiring, cited the hospital in November for 
five "serious" violations of law and one lesser violation. 
</P>
<P>
Violations are classified as serious if they create a "substantial probability 
that an employee will suffer death or serious physical harm," and if the 
employer through "reasonable diligence" should have known of the problem and 
corrected it, according to Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
Crawl spaces in four of the same buildings were among 24 buildings at 
Metropolitan where asbestos hazards were discovered in a 1986 survey by the 
Office of the State Architect, state officials confirmed. They said, however, 
that hazards were rated low two years ago and prompt abatement was not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials say they have responded promptly to all known hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Employees are trained to identify asbestos, and a private contractor has been 
hired to remove it when it is friable, or crumbly, said Silva, who has been 
hospital director for a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime it's identified, it's blocked off until it's abated. We take this 
issue very seriously," Silva said. "When it comes to cost, and you're talking 
about a person's health and welfare, we're not going to quibble about cost." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Eubanks, Silva's assistant, noted in a recent interview that about 
$230,000 has been spent to remove or encapsulate hazardous asbestos in the 24 
buildings where hazards were identified in the 1986 state survey. 
</P>
<P>
As for Snell's allegations of harassment and near dismissal, Eubanks would not 
comment other than to say Snell's complaints about asbestos had nothing to do 
with his treatment by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
But some workers see things differently. It is Snell, the determined union 
steward, whose name they often mention when describing their own increasing 
sensitivity to asbestos hazards at Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
"The supervisors class him as a troublemaker," maintenance worker Quincel 
Holley said. "But I see him as somebody who's doing something that's right. 
Jerry keeps them on their toes. They think, 'What's he going to do now?' And it 
benefits all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Snell is not a hard guy to get along with, said sheet-metal worker 
Jesus Barrios, "but as far as this asbestos thing, he's just been adamant that 
the men should not get in a situation where they endanger their health. He's 
just been very vocal about it." 
</P>
<P>
Snell, who lives in Norwalk with his wife, an elementary schoolteacher, and two 
teen-age children, said he never sought recognition through his role as a 
whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
But four years in the Navy after his 1964 graduation from Burbank High School 
helped build his resolve to confront problems directly, Snell said. Eight years 
with an aggressive union at the old Firestone tire plant in South Gate in the 
1970s also made him keenly aware of employees' rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to be a walking conscience for (Firestone) management," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snell, who was then in his 20s, acknowledges that he made youthful mistakes at 
Firestone and said he may have developed a reputation as a nit-picker. 
</P>
<P>
Snell arrived at Metropolitan in 1981 and said he strictly followed orders 
until the laundry incident in February, 1983. After that, he said, he used his 
union experience to sometimes buck superiors when they ordered him onto 
asbestos jobs for which he thought he was not adequately trained or protected. 
</P>
<P>
"I might do it, but not without a kick and fight," he said. But usually, he 
said, he would file complaints then back away to give supervisors time to 
respond and for their anger to subside. 
</P>
<P>
To isolate him from other workers, Snell said, supervisors assigned him to a 
solitary watch of the hospital's four large steam-producing boilers in July, 
1984. He served there for 14 months and for 17 months more in 1986 and 1987 
until the boiler room was closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour by Managers 
</P>
<P>
However, Snell's complaints about brittle asbestos in the boiler room prompted 
a 1985 tour of the building by two hospital managers and, in 1986, the material 
was finally sealed off, according to Snell and hospital documents. 
</P>
<P>
Then he painted the red arrows on asbestos-laden pipes. "The administration at 
that time was refusing to discuss the (asbestos) issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, he was involved in a confrontation at an employee training 
session, where, he said, he challenged his supervisor's assertion that asbestos 
was not a hazard to hospital maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
He had survived a dismissal hearing just five months earlier, and the meeting 
was being videotaped, so he withheld comment at first, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But after a few minutes, they just put down (another dissenter), so I picked 
up and it just turned into a shouting match between myself and the chief 
engineer," Snell said. "The next day they told me I was back down in the boiler 
room by myself." 
</P>
<P>
A letter formally notifying Snell of his August, 1986, reassignment to the 
boiler room graveyard shift said the move made "the most optimal use of 
engineering staff skills." Snell's union complained, charging harassment, but 
the assignment stuck. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, according to a grievance filed by Barrios and 19 other 
crafts employees, the hospital formally notified the workers that they would 
routinely be required to help outside contractors in removing asbestos from the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The workers filed a grievance and won, with top hospital administrators 
agreeing that staff workers would only have to remove or encapsulate "minimal" 
amounts of asbestos when doing repairs. But that decision has sometimes been 
ignored, Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
"You say, 'Isn't that asbestos?' And they say, 'No, it's safe. That's not 
asbestos,' " Barrios said. "It seems like management doesn't care if it's a 
danger to the worker as long as the work gets done. . . . They break their own 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference of Opinion 
</P>
<P>
In response to such complaints, hospital administrator Eubanks said: "There 
would be a difference of opinion of what is major and what is minor, and that 
may be the crux of (the dispute)." 
</P>
<P>
It has been Metropolitan's policy since October, 1985, to use only outside 
contractors for large asbestos projects, Eubanks said. Properly equipped 
maintenance workers and craftsmen are sometimes directed to do minor repairs 
involving removal of small amounts of asbestos, as allowed by law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snell and other workers said they saw the hospital's 1986 attempt to begin 
regularly assigning them to asbestos abatement projects as the hospital's first 
open admission of a large asbestos problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They went from the official position that the stuff doesn't exist to, 'We 
admit we got it and guess who's going to get rid of it for us,' " Snell said. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later Snell took a leave of absence and filed an unsuccessful 
claim of disability caused by stress on the job. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he returned in January, 1987, administrative changes had begun to 
affect hospital policy on asbestos, said Snell and other workers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, new safety regulations have put workers and supervisors on their 
guard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Snell said, "They started saying to us, 'If you're concerned about 
asbestos, it's incumbent on you to protect yourself.' " Hospital policy, 
according to administrative responses to grievances about asbestos exposure in 
1988, is that workers are responsible for reporting unsafe conditions to their 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, though acknowledging the asbestos hazard, can be risky to follow, 
because it puts workers in the position of disobeying supervisors and facing 
discipline if the worker and his boss disagree on whether a job can be done 
safely, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Snell's status -- and perhaps his approach to problems -- also seems to have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Post 
</P>
<P>
He was named to his union's statewide contract negotiating team this year. Jim 
Tatum, the representative of the International Union of Operating Engineers who 
made the appointment, said Snell is "a very knowledgeable and very 
conscientious employee" who recognized Metropolitan's serious asbestos problem 
long before many others. 
</P>
<P>
"We are discovering in many of our state facilities that the problem is more 
extensive than we believed at first. It seems like it's just now being 
defined," Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
Shop steward Failing, who has worked closely with Snell this year, said his 
colleague is respected partly because he can remain calm during tense 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more of a diplomat than I am," Failing said. "He gets on people's nerves 
in a different way than I do. He kind of still retains his sense of humor and 
not his hostility towards the administration. He doesn't show it, so sometimes 
he can communicate pretty good. It's gotten to be an emotional thing with me. 
When I go to work in the morning it's almost like suiting up to go into battle 
instead of going to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Snell said that while asbestos problems remain serious, he can now joke with 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'When are you going to reactivate the boiler room and put me back on 
graveyard?' It's nice to be able to joke about that," he said. "I think 
management thinks I'm a pain . . . but now I can walk into about any office any 
time and discuss problems they've refused to discuss in the past." 
</P>
<P>
With the air of someone who has won an important battle, Snell added: 
</P>
<P>
"(Supervisors) mean well, I think, but they're so confused about what to do and 
their hands are so tied by financing. I myself wouldn't want the responsibility 
of dealing with this asbestos problem."

FRUSTRATED RETAILERS SAY RENAISSANCE REMAINS AN UNFULFILLED PROMISE ALONG 
SHOWCASE OF DOWNTOWN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mum's had a slow night last week. As a mere handful of customers dined in the 
elegant downtown Long Beach restaurant, owner John Morris doubled as host in 
place of an employee he had recently let go to reduce overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at System M, things were not much better. There, as eight 
people sipped coffee and wine in the trendy 42-seat cafe, co-owner Moins 
Rastgar chatted with customers about, among other things, the 90-hour 
work-weeks he and his partner average in trying to make the place go. 
</P>
<P>
And down the street at the Overreact Gallery, a bored-looking attendant flipped 
distractedly through a magazine without a browser in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, they formed a portrait of unfulfilled promise on Pine Avenue, 
this city's much-touted showcase for its ambitious downtown redevelopment 
plans. The goal was to create a vibrant retail center capable of attracting 
large numbers of daytime shoppers and nighttime revelers. The reality is that, 
so far at least, the avenue's wide sidewalks -- which once won an award for 
being comfortable to pedestrian feet -- have remained largely devoid of those 
appendages, especially after hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been horrible," said Al Williams, who slightly more than two years ago 
opened Birdland West, a late-night jazz club at the corner of Pine and 
Broadway. "I wouldn't have done it if I'd known how hard it would be. I'd have 
moved to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Williams was the first of a string of enterprising restaurateurs and 
entertainment- or culture-oriented business people to open new establishments 
along Pine Avenue, convinced that they were part of a downtown renaissance. 
Although many remain optimistic and point to recent signs portending a 
turnaround, they also admit that the hoped-for resurgence has been much longer 
in coming than any would have predicted. As a result, they say, some of the new 
establishments have already failed while others are barely hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, for instance, two new restaurants -- Off Broadway and Cocomo 
Joe's -- have closed because of a lack of customers. "It just became 
unbearable," said Paul Fillman, former owner of Cocomo Joe's. The restaurant 
was in business only four months. "There's so much competition right now and 
the market isn't that large." 
</P>
<P>
Justina's, a restaurant that opened a year and a half ago, recently underwent a 
financial reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and is 
operating at reduced hours, according to its owners. 
</P>
<P>
And the old Masonic Temple, a historic building that developer Lloyd Ikerd 
spent three years and $2 million remodeling, came very close to going into 
foreclosure recently because of what Ikerd describes as his inability to 
attract permanent tenants. "I'm still losing about $20,000 a month," he said. 
"Redevelopment hasn't been a raging success." 
</P>
<P>
Even businesses that are doing relatively well, such as Mum's and Pine Avenue 
Grill, say they are operating significantly under capacity, especially at 
night, and are just now breaking even or beginning to make small profits. "It 
hasn't happened yet," said Jeff King, chairman of the board at the company that 
owns Pine Avenue Grill, which opened nine months ago. "We have no alternative 
but to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
While daytime crowds aren't bad, business people say, the real crunch comes at 
night when downtown office workers go home and customers from elsewhere in the 
city fail to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants attribute the problem to several factors, most notably that Long 
Beach residents citywide have so far refused to let go of their long-held image 
of downtown as a downbeat area high in crime and low in amenities. That 
perception has persisted in part, they say, because many promised improvements 
-- including movie theaters, ample parking, good lighting and increased police 
patrols -- have come more slowly than expected. Many blame the delays on 
bureaucratic foot dragging by the city's Redevelopment Agency -- and more 
specifically on its outgoing director, Roger C. Anderman, who they say has been 
largely unresponsive to the needs of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tendency to delay in acting on contracts," said Bill Gurzi, president 
of the Downtown Long Beach Associates, a city-sponsored agency charged with 
promoting the downtown area. "The agency needs someone who is able to take more 
definitive action and do so with great confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Said King: "What we need is less rhetoric and more activism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shares Merchants' Frustration 
</P>
<P>
Anderman, who has directed the agency since 1986, says he shares the merchants' 
frustration at the slow pace of change. But the slowness, he says, is the 
natural price of doing things right rather than a result of bureaucratic 
indecisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that their hopes and expectations have not been realized," 
Anderman said, "but that's part of the risk you take when you become a pioneer 
and get in on the ground floor of something that is about to happen. We've been 
pushing to get things accomplished, but it takes time to be done well. You 
simply can't put everything in place at once; why make a mistake that the 
community will regret forever?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the merchants see cause for optimism in Anderman's announcement two 
weeks ago that he will leave at the end of the month to become assistant city 
manager of Fremont, a city of 160,000 near San Francisco. "With a new director 
of downtown redevelopment will come a new outlook . . . of cooperation and 
support for the retail businesses that are already here," Gurzi predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent developments -- many of which, ironically, came at Anderman's 
behest -- have also been well received. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Accessible Office 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, for instance, the city's economic development bureau moved 
its offices from City Hall to a Pine Avenue storefront from which bureau 
manager Hank Cunningham administers small business loans, provides business 
consulting, spearheads downtown promotions and acts as a general liaison 
between retailers and the city. "We feel that we are more accessible here," 
Cunningham said. "We are part of the business community itself -- right here in 
the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
Also, since the first of the year the Redevelopment Agency, responding to 
longstanding complaints by downtown merchants, has been offering two hours of 
free parking to customers during daylight hours and unlimited free parking at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
After years of what retailers took to be lethargy, city officials finally 
appear to be moving forward on two major issues considered vital to the growth 
of downtown: development by 1990 of a downtown movie theater complex, and an 
expansion of the convention center which, it is hoped, will help fill new hotel 
rooms and give downtown businesses a shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
Down on Pine, though, something of a siege mentality has set in. The 
encroaching enemy is the empty sidewalk. The distant cavalry is time. The only 
unanswered question: which of the pioneers will be able to hang on long enough 
to see the prosperous future they believe is coming? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Definitions 
</P>
<P>
It can be seen at meetings of the Pine Avenue Merchants Assn., where members 
frantically try to decipher what sort of promotions will actually work. Or in 
the private bickerings up and down the street over just what kind of a place it 
should be. While one faction envisions Pine Avenue as sort of an upscale trendy 
Melrose-type district, others contend that it must attract the kind of less 
affluent shoppers and diners who will come out for a $9.95 T-shirt special. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly you can see it in the bleakness of weekday nights, when some 
establishments seem almost desperate to get people in. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Anthony, a 27-year-old longshoreman, had never been to Birdland West 
before one recent Tuesday night. He showed up, however, because a pass he had 
received at a local restaurant enabled him to enter without paying the usual $6 
admission. "It's more than I expected," he said of the rich-looking jazz club 
decorated with art deco trimmings. "I thought it would be a hole in the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Dunn, a local waitress who entered that same night, also got an 
inducement: an impromptu discount on the price offered at the door when an 
attendant realized that she was about to change her mind and walk away. "I was 
expecting jazz," said Dunn, 39. Instead she got an evening of comedy, something 
the club has been offering weekly for the past four months in an attempt to 
broaden its audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Left Early 
</P>
<P>
In Dunn's case, however, the attendant's quick thinking had only a short-term 
effect. "The humor was terrible," the waitress said, leaving in a huff after 
the second set. "They should have some live music or something." 
</P>
<P>
So the hustle continues, with one overriding question dominating the minds of 
Pine Avenue merchants. Simply put, it is this: What will work and what will 
not? 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the question is a shared perception, recently given voice by 
Downtown Long Beach Associates president Gurzi. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is still out on Pine Avenue," he said. "Either it will develop the 
way we all want it to, or it will be a failure and become a ghost street." 
</P>
<P>
More than a few fortunes are riding on the outcome.

DEPARTING DIRECTOR ASSESSES HIS ACHIEVEMENTS, DISAPPOINTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger C. Anderman, 44, arrived in Long Beach in 1984 as manager of the 
city's development bureau. Two years later he was promoted to director of 
community development and has overseen the city's ambitious redevelopment 
efforts. Two weeks ago he announced his resignation, effective later this 
month. He was interviewed last week by Times Staff Writer David Haldane. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: You have been accused of foot-dragging on redevelopment, especially 
in the downtown area. People say that because of you, everything has taken 
longer than expected and business is bad. How do you plead? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's not true. Anybody who takes the risk of investing in something 
that is not a sure thing has to expect that there is a possibility that their 
expectations won't materialize fully. It's wrong to point blame for that. The 
only problem with the redevelopment project is that it isn't done yet. We're 
looking at a completed downtown that may happen 10 to 15 years in the future 
and the average citizen isn't aware of the kind of planning that must go in. We 
are making a multimillion-dollar investment and we can't be any more foolish 
with public money than (private investors) can be with private money. We feel 
that it's awfully important with the valuable resources of land we have that it 
not be wasted and not be used incorrectly. As frustrating as it is to 
individuals, that's the reality of how redevelopment works. I wish all these 
things were in force today, but the reality is that downtown is developing at a 
certain pace. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But don't you feel some responsibility for all the new businesses that have 
come on line in the last two years expecting to be part of a downtown 
resurgence that hasn't yet happened? 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the joys of the free enterprise system is that people have the right 
to fail. Ninety percent of all new businesses fail. We have all kinds of 
programs to help, but there are some people who simply aren't as good in 
business as others and their right to fail is nobody else's fault. I don't 
think it's the job of government to protect those individuals from the natural 
consequences of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you believe that the city's downtown redevelopment is still healthy and 
proceeding according to plan? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. When I first came here, the city was in the mode of doing everything it 
could to attract investors. Today we are in the position of literally having to 
choose between highly qualified investors who are falling all over each other 
to invest in downtown Long Beach. But that means we have to sift them out for 
those who are the most sincere, most qualified and the best people to invest. 
This belongs to the city, so the city has to be vigilant in making sure that 
what is developed here is in everybody's interest and not just the interests of 
the developers. We could open the doors and say 'Build whatever you want,' and 
you would see construction going on like never before, but what you would have 
is a hodgepodge of development and five years from now, people would be saying, 
'Why did the city ever let them do that?' 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you consider the most important accomplishments of your tenure here? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shoreline Square, Landmark Square, the Pike property project and the 
downtown theater complex on which we're about to take bids. I also feel that 
the resurgence of Pine Avenue has a lot to do with my initiatives such as the 
business loan program, technical assistance programs and the high priority 
placed by the Redevelopment Agency on the rejuvenation of Pine. Elsewhere, the 
(proposed) auto mall project is one that many people said couldn't be done, and 
I was instrumental in developing the housing development fund and housing 
development program. At the Long Beach Airport, I was instrumental in 
attracting some high-quality commercial development. Also, the West Long Beach 
industrial redevelopment project -- a little-noticed but important part of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Any major disappointments? 
</P>
<P>
A: I would like everything to have happened faster. I also would like to have 
completed two condo projects on Ocean Boulevard that got bogged down by 
financial and technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What still needs to be done? 
</P>
<P>
A: We really need to deal with the problem of inadequate retail service. Long 
Beach is still a major exporter of retail sales and that is a major challenge 
for future years. Also, we must begin meeting the housing needs of the city. 
Prices are escalating rapidly and exactly how and where the needs of all income 
segments are to be met is a significant issue. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Any advice for your successor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Take advantage of the ground work that has been done, move ahead with all of 
the many projects in process or about to begin and always keep sight of the 
ultimate goal of an ideal city so that inappropriate compromises don't come 
back to haunt the community in the future. That's not to say go slow, it's to 
say go carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are your thoughts as you leave this city behind to accept the 
challenges of your new job as assistant city manager of Fremont? Is Long Beach 
significantly different from the way you found it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Long Beach is a more economically vital, attractive, interesting and 
exciting city. I played a role in helping make that happen. It's on its way to 
becoming an absolutely first-class international city. I believe it will happen 
even more now than I ever did. I see the commitment to that on the part of 
public officials, citizens, developers, businesses and others. Before, it was a 
dream, now I think we're seeing signs of the reality, and when you can see 
signs of the reality you can believe it's going to happen.

More than $8,000 in contributions has been received by Cerritos College in 
establishing a "living memorial" scholarship for a student who died at sea last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Terry Hammond Memorial Scholarship awards a $200 maximum scholarship per 
year to any student at the college showing financial need and who is enrolled 
in a Ford Automotive Services Educational Training Program, a campus official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only the interest portion of the $8,000 will be used for scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, a 24-year-old automotive student at the time of his death, went on a 
fishing trip with friends last May when the boat they were traveling in had 
engine failure. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond vanished during an attempt to swim to shore in stormy seas, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>

financial aid office, 860-2451, Ext. 246.

BELLFLOWER PLANNER NAMED;

<P>
CERRITOS COLLEGE BOARD FILLS VACANCY

Joseph Stits, a high school principal and Bellflower planning commissioner, was 
chosen over eight candidates last week to fill the Cerritos Community College 
term of outgoing Trustee Robert D. Epple. 
</P>
<P>
Stits, 51 and principal of Somerset Continuation High School, won appointment 
on a 5-1 trustee vote. Trustee Ruth Banda, also of Bellflower, cast the 
dissenting ballot. Stits will serve at least until next November, when his seat 
and three others go up for election. 
</P>
<P>
Epple resigned last fall upon his election to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I have something to offer in regards that my background has been so varied," 
Stits said of his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Professional Educator 
</P>
<P>
Because he is a professional educator whose wife, Darla, works part-time as a 
graphics designer for the college, Stits said he had worried that the trustees 
might see him as having "a couple of liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Stits has worked in the Bellflower Unified School District for the past 25 
years as a teacher, counselor and administrator, and has more than 20 years of 
professional and community service in the area. 
</P>
<P>
He is the past president of both the Bellflower Leadership and Support Team and 
the Los Angeles County Continuation Education Assn. He has a bachelor's degree 
in social science from Cal State Long Beach and a master's degree in psychology 
and counseling from La Verne University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pleased 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens' Mayor Kathleen Navejas, a frequent opponent of the at-large 
selection and appointment process for trustees, said she was pleased with 
Stits' selection. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like they (the trustees) made a good choice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stits may be asked to resign his Planning Commission post if Bellflower 
officials determine that it poses a conflict of interest with his 
responsibilities as a college trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Stits said he is unsure whether he will seek election to the board in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to learn to be a good board member," he said. "It takes a while to 
learn the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates had applied for the appointed position, but one withdrew before 
last week's trustee vote.

L.A. IN THE MIND OF AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
NEW REALITIES ARE CHANGING THE OLD PERCEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Ronald Brownstein is a contributing editor of this 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOT LONG AGO, Allen J. Scott, a UCLA professor of urban geography with an eye 
for the unexamined, applied to the National Science Foundation for a federal 
grant to study industry in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Scott thought he had a strong case. Little scholarly work had been done on 
Southern California's remarkably vibrant manufacturing base, which embraces 
everything from textile and furniture factories that compete with Third World 
sweatshops to sophisticated aerospace and computer companies that push the 
outside of the envelope in high technology. So overlooked was the area's 
industrial role that a map reflecting high-technology companies didn't mention 
the region at all -- although it had already become the nation's largest 
high-tech center. 
</P>
<P>
Scott wanted to fill in some of those blanks. His request worked its way 
through the agency's bureaucracy, until it reached the foundation's outside 
academic consultants. They were not so much hostile as perplexed. "They said, 
'Why do you want to study industry in Los Angeles? Everybody knows that 
industry in the U.S. is in places like Detroit and Buffalo and Cleveland and 
that Los Angeles is . . . built around the movies,' " Scott recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The professor's proposal had run into a wall -- a new Great Divide -- 
separating East from West: the line where the old image of Los Angeles collides 
with the city's emerging reality. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Los Angeles has been defined for the outside world primarily by 
Hollywood and its attendant culture: a city of shallowness, vapid 
self-absorption and orgiastic materialism. Distilled to its essence in "Annie 
Hall," this is the Woody Allen vision of Los Angeles, the city that defines 
culture as the freedom to turn right on red. Since you can now turn right on 
red in most places, New York's irreverent Spy magazine recently updated the 
aphorism in its special issue on the city: L.A. is the place people go "to do 
everything they're too embarrassed to do in Manhattan." Los Angeles: City 
Without Shame. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, a noticeable upsurge in interest in Los Angeles on the part of 
serious writers and thinkers is challenging the stereotypes. Most immediately, 
this reassessment has produced a new appreciation of Los Angeles as a financial 
center (the clear financial leader of the West Coast, second to New York 
nationally); a business center (with thriving high-tech and manufacturing 
communities), and even a cultural center, with new museums and a bustling local 
arts scene. It's the stuff of gently paternalistic "Los Angeles Comes of Age" 
articles. It has also heightened interest in the city's fashion, food and art. 
</P>
<P>
But, more basically, this recent reassessment suggests an entirely different 
way of looking at Los Angeles: as a window on the future of the country. Not a 
movie fantasy future, or a laboratory for pop fads, but a city at the forefront 
of economic and demographic change, a model of the multiracial, economically 
diverse, Pacific-oriented nation America is becoming. Pieces of this picture 
emerge in a new book by Scott; another recently published book by journalist 
Joel Kotkin and management consultant Yoriko Kishimoto; a cover story in the 
Atlantic Monthly last year by Christopher Leinberger and Charles Lockwood; a 
book coming this spring from the Atlantic's Washington editor, James Fallows, 
and at least three other major books on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how even thick-headed New Yorkers can indefinitely ignore the fact 
that in many essential ways, to the destiny of their country, it is what is 
happening in Los Angeles . . . that is determinative," says David Rieff, a 
senior editor at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux now writing a book about Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE national mythology, California, particularly Southern California, has 
always been on the front line of social trends. If California didn't initiate 
the postwar move to suburbia, it perfected it. In the early 1960s, the campus 
and inner-city unrest that eventually engulfed the nation crystallized in 
Berkeley and Watts. The singles scene that defined the anomie of the 1970s 
found its purest expression in the beach-front towns of Los Angeles; it was 
morning again in America here first, with Los Angeles, and then the nation, 
awaking to a solipsistic vision of sunshine, greed and the perfect bicep. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Southern California also came to be seen as the spawning ground 
for political trends. The professionalization of politics -- the creation of a 
priesthood of political consultants -- began here in the mid-1960s. The 
conservative backlash against the 1960s drew its first blood with the election 
of Ronald Reagan as governor in 1965. Environmentalism emerged as a powerful 
political force after the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969. In the mid-1970s, 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown sketched the first outlines of a liberalism with 
limits. And in 1978, crusty Howard Jarvis' Proposition 13 heralded the dawning 
of the anti-government rebellion that swept Reagan into the Oval Office two 
years later. In the 1980s, California has pioneered the impersonal, media- and 
money-based negative politics that now dominates national elections. 
</P>
<P>
All of these trends influenced the nation's life in meaningful ways, but they 
didn't really challenge the stereotypical view of Los Angeles. Southern 
California's reputation as the nation's social foundry only reinforced its 
reputation for obsessively trendy quirkiness; it remains known as the place 
that gave the world Valley-speak, channelers and macrobiotic gurus. Political 
ideas from the state often have been swept up in the same tail wind. All of 
Brown's eccentricities, for example, were highlighted by his backdrop; Gov. 
Moonbeam was as much a parody of California's purported strangeness as it was 
of Brown himself. Strangeness is as inextricably bound to L.A.'s image as sand. 
</P>
<P>
That link shows no signs of dissolving. But still another new picture is being 
superimposed on the old, as in a photograph constructed through multiple 
exposures. If Los Angeles' old image was as the hothouse for evanescent, silly 
trends, the slowly developing image is as the testing ground for fundamental 
changes in the way we live. 
</P>
<P>
What are those changes? The most apparent is in the design of the city itself. 
Los Angeles is accustomed to criticism from visiting Easterners who ask, with 
disorientation and disgust: Where is the city? But, in fact, urban experts now 
maintain, Los Angeles' style of decentralized development has proved to be the 
model for every American city that has emerged in the 20th Century, from Denver 
to Dallas to Phoenix. America, in other words, has grown up to look like Los 
Angeles, not New York. 
</P>
<P>
All cities, notes Joel Garreau, a senior writer at the Washington Post and 
author of "The Nine Nations of North America," "are formed by whatever is the 
state-of-the-art transportation at the time" of their creation. New York, 
Philadelphia, Boston -- the great, traditional cities of the East -- coalesced 
when the dominant modes of transportation were horses, trolleys, feet and 
subways; thus development had to be centralized. But, Los Angeles, Garreau 
says, "is the first truly 20th-Century city in America" -- the first laid out 
to meet the demands of the automobile, with multiple centers of housing and 
business, and networks of freeways connecting them. Garreau, who is writing a 
book about the phenomenon, calls dispersed centers, such as Irvine, "edge 
cities"; writers Leinberger and Lockwood call them "urban villages" or 
"constellations" in an urban "galaxy." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you call them, these far-flung centers linked by highways have become 
the rule, not the exception, in urban development. "Every American city that is 
growing now is growing in one and only one fashion: like Los Angeles, with 
these multiple urban centers, in the spider-web fashion," Garreau says. "As a 
practical matter, the vast majority of the new wealth and new jobs being 
created in America today are . . . in these new hubs." Even the nation's 
compact 19th-Century-style cities -- from San Francisco and Seattle to 
Washington and Boston -- are emulating this style of development, sprouting new 
"downtowns" and population centers on their peripheries. "In Boston, they 
celebrate Route 128 as the home of the computer industry," Garreau says. "But 
what is 128? 128 is Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Los Angeles is also coming to be viewed as the fountainhead of a 
second basic trend reshaping American life: the immigration-driven 
transformation of the country "from a European offshoot to a multiracial 'world 
nation' . . . with ethnic ties to virtually every race and region on the 
planet," as Kotkin and Kishimoto put it in their book, "The Third Century." 
During the 1980s, the tide of legal immigration into this country -- most of it 
from Asia and Latin America -- is expected to match, or even exceed, the 
historic rush of the huddled masses from Europe at the turn of the century. 
Through 2010, the Southern California Assn. of Governments has projected, the 
Southland will absorb an average of 110,000 immigrants annually; by then, 
minorities will make up a clear majority of the region's population. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing a future historian will note about 20th-Century America is 
immigration . . . and Los Angeles is the great place to look at what this 
America . . . will be," says Rieff, whose book is tentatively titled "Los 
Angeles: Capital of The Third World." 
</P>
<P>
This analysis is moving beyond the familiar fact of immigration -- Los Angeles 
as the new Ellis Island -- to a sophisticated understanding of its effect. To 
many observers, this unprecedented mingling of diverse cultures -- not the menu 
at Spago or the Ferrari double-parked on Rodeo Drive -- has become the defining 
fact of life in the city. Author Ryzsard Kapuscinski argued recently in New 
Perspectives Quarterly, a California-based political journal, that in Los 
Angeles, the mold for a new American culture is being set: not the traditional 
melting pot of assimilating cultures, but a "collage" of co-existing, disparate 
ones. Kapuscinski sees Los Angeles producing an unpredictable cultural dynamism 
reminiscent of turn-of-the-century Vienna as Asian, Latino, Anglo and black 
influences interact. 
</P>
<P>
To journalist Fallows, whose book, "More Like Us," will be published by 
Houghton Mifflin this spring, Los Angeles most clearly embodies the creative 
economic and cultural "disruption" -- the challenge to accepted, staid, 
approaches -- that immigration offers the nation. "Without that kind of 
'disruption,' America becomes a stagnant and inflexible society," he says. 
"Immigration is one part of a general disruptiveness that America needs to 
survive, and Los Angeles and California is the leading example of how that 
happens." Similarly, Kotkin and Kishimoto portray Southern California's 
Asia-oriented, entrepreneurial, immigrant-fueled economy as the model for an 
American economic renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
In that way, they see the immigrant influx reinforcing a third cutting-edge 
national trend most apparent in Los Angeles: the organization of the local 
economy into an extraordinarily dense web of small- and mid-sized companies. 
Although Los Angeles has large employers in industries such as aerospace, its 
economic base rests on smaller entrepreneurial companies in everything from 
high technology to textiles that spin off enormous numbers of new jobs; 95% of 
all Los Angeles businesses have fewer than 50 employees. Put another way, Los 
Angeles' economy now mirrors its physical geography: dispersed and diverse. The 
centrifugal trends reinforce each other, with the physical sprawl providing 
plenty of space for these small companies to inexpensively set up shop, notes 
Richard Weinstein, dean of the UCLA graduate school of architecture and urban 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
This distinctive pattern has made Los Angeles "a trend-setter as far as the 
economic structure of a metropolitan area is concerned," says Leinberger, an 
urban-development expert at Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co. In yet another 
recent book, "Metropolis: From the Division of Labor to Urban Form," UCLA 
geography professor Scott argues that this flexible, non-union, small-shop 
economy has become the model "of the new patterns of industrialization and 
urbanization now being laid down on the American economic landscape." Other 
American cities, Scott maintains, will increasingly conform to the L.A. 
economic model in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Taken to one extreme, optimists such as Kotkin and Kishimoto believe that these 
economic and demographic forces, combined with the city's orientation toward 
the Pacific, could transform Los Angeles from " 'Tinseltown' into what could 
well be the nation's most important city in its third century." Less sanguine 
observers, such as Weinstein and Derek Shearer, professor of public policy at 
Los Angeles' Occidental College, worry that those soaring prophecies overlook 
the real ruts in the road: an increasingly non-white school system that will 
have to be supported largely by whites; the potential of the city to fracture 
into a wealthy white elite and an underclass made up mostly of non-whites; and 
the growing strains of congestion, traffic and pollution that could choke off 
the region's growth. 
</P>
<P>
FROM DIFFERENT angles, those conflicting visions challenge the traditional, 
lightweight view of the city. Los Angeles may become the nation's next great 
power center; it may become a new paradigm of urban dismay, and it may find 
itself straddling those divergent tracks -- but it is no longer a place, if it 
ever was, whose principal ingredients are spandex, hair gel, sprouts and 
Coppertone. 
</P>
<P>
The coming flow of books examining the city in a new light offers one 
flickering sign that America's opinion leaders are ready to begin reconsidering 
their gauzy take on Los Angeles. "There is a lot of interest in reassessing," 
says Bill Bradley, publisher of a California political newsletter, who recently 
signed a contract to write a book about the ways the California experience can 
provide a new model for America's future. When he visited publishers in New 
York last summer, Bradley says, "there was a real sense among them that 
something important is happening out West, perhaps more important than the 
latest premiere or the latest hair style." 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of change is the way elite Eastern newspapers such as the 
Washington Post and the New York Times now cover Los Angeles. In the Post, L.A. 
bureau chief Jay Mathews is in the midst of an irregular series on how 
immigration is changing the country; in the New York Times, new L.A. bureau 
chief Robert Reinhold has examined racial tensions in this city of immigrants, 
the controversies over growth and Los Angeles' emergence as the West Coast 
capital of finance and culture. 
</P>
<P>
These new images are beginning to challenge the old ones. Until recently, the 
Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank based in Santa Monica, found it 
difficult to convince Eastern money sources that anyone on the West Coast was 
committed to contemplating something more challenging than the perfect wave. 
"But the changed reality of Los Angeles is making a big difference in our 
ability to have a credible reputation with Eastern foundations and 
corporations," says Robert W. Poole Jr., Reason's president. "They see that 
money is coming here now, serious money, and not just the entertainment 
industry; they see major banks as well as Japanese banks as fixtures in Los 
Angeles; they see real estate being owned by the Japanese; they see national 
firms like Citicorp and Chase Manhattan getting their names on big buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Still, that isn't the L.A. most of the country typically sees. Most national 
magazine coverage of Los Angeles emanates from New York and remains fixated on 
the movie business and its trendy satellites in West L.A. As one West Coast 
contributor to an East Coast publication put it, for editors in New York "the 
coast is a euphemism for the movie business." In the book publishing industry 
-- Bradley's experience notwithstanding -- the old stereotype hangs on even 
more tenaciously. In academia, as UCLA professor Scott discovered, the story is 
largely the same. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER ALL THESE years, why is it that these cramped and myopic images are so 
resilient? 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that, inadequate as they may be, they're not entirely inaccurate; 
the stereotypes mercilessly capture one piece of Los Angeles. After all, Spy 
didn't make television producers Candy and Aaron Spelling build themselves a 
house the size of a department store in Holmby Hills; they just recoiled from 
it -- when they saw it -- something like Martin Sheen when he finally comes 
upon bloated Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now." 
</P>
<P>
Fear and envy -- perennially popular motivations -- also help explain New 
York's particularly sulfurous disdain for Los Angeles, Kotkin and Leinberger 
say. Much the way mannered Boston and Philadelphia looked down on grubby, 
arriviste New York as it shouldered past them to economic supremacy in the 19th 
Century, they argue, New Yorkers now denigrate spacey, flaky Los Angeles with 
vigor directly proportional to the accumulating evidence of its economic 
prowess. That explanation for New York's hostility has a pleasing historical 
weight, but to New Yorkers, worried more about subway breakdowns than global 
shifts in power, it feels like something of a reach. "That's a little bit of 
wish-ful fillment," says Mickey Kaus, a New York-based senior writer for 
Newsweek and former West Coast correspondent for The New Republic. "New York 
maybe should fear Los Angeles more than it does, but New York is really falsely 
contented." 
</P>
<P>
More tangible, and less arguable, is California's isolation from the 
predominantly Eastern circles that set the nation's conventional wisdom in 
politics, culture and the media. It's easier for the Eastern opinion leaders to 
ignore the new realities of California -- best exemplified by Los Angeles -- 
because so few Californians are part of their world. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the American Assembly, a national convocation launched after World War 
II by Averell Harriman and Dwight Eisenhower, which brings together economic 
and political leaders to chew over The Big Questions. It is now engaged in a 
massive multiyear study on the United States' changing global role that will 
produce six books, six national gatherings and 35 regional assemblies; this is 
to the academic conference what "War and Remembrance" is to the miniseries. But 
only about 10% of the people who have agreed so far to participate in this epic 
undertaking are from the West Coast, says Daniel A. Sharp, the assembly's 
president. "The foreign-policy network is very much East Coast-dominated," 
Sharp says. "It is hard to identify as many people outside the East Coast who 
are thoroughly knowledgeable and influential in foreign affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Individual experts have carved out a niche on national policy from California; 
but even on subjects that should be California's area of expertise, such as 
relations with Asia or Mexico, Eastern policy- and opinion-makers generally 
don't look toward this state. "In terms of policy, California still has a long 
way to go before its real weight is felt in the East," says Sharp, in a 
judgment echoed by several Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is simply social. At Los Angeles parties, academics and 
other intellectuals jostle movie stars; at Washington parties, they mingle with 
assistant secretaries of state. "We don't have as great an influence on the 
public-policy process simply because we are not interacting socially with the 
people who are prowling the halls of power in Washington," says the Reason 
Foundation's Poole. 
</P>
<P>
Distance doesn't explain everything, though. "There is nothing surprising about 
the East Coast attitude about all of this," says John Gerard Ruggie, professor 
of international relations at University of California, San Diego, who 
relocated here recently from Columbia University in New York. "What most 
puzzles me is the response on the part of California: the lack of burning 
desire to do something about it. What I can't understand is the lack of concern 
or interest in building up the institutions for California to have a voice in 
national- or foreign-policy debates." 
</P>
<P>
Ruggie, like many California boosters, laments the absence of think-tanks, 
institutes and indigenous publications that could offer an alternate definition 
of Los Angeles to the rest of the country and interpret national policy through 
California's unique experiences and interests. From Los Angeles, for example, 
expanding economic relations with Asia looks much less threatening than from, 
say, Detroit; but the tone of the national debate over trade has been set by 
East Coast and Rust Belt voices, not Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the self-confident intellectual institutions," Kotkin says. 
"There is no Western-oriented think-tank that I'm aware of projecting, not a 
future of the West, but a future of the country. Institutes in New York and 
Washington don't think twice about being able to think for the country." 
</P>
<P>
Why in a city so huge and affluent -- with so much intellectual brainpower at 
its universities -- is that instinct so wanting? Kaus maintains that it is 
because "the people who do the sort of thing that creates the conventional 
wisdom back East aren't valued in Los Angeles. That may be good sense on Los 
Angeles' part. But NBC president Brandon Tartikoff will always be a bigger man 
than if L.A. produced a syndicated political columnist like Jack Germond. If 
L.A. had a culture that made a big deal of people who played that game . . . it 
would be different. Washington and New York have that culture." 
</P>
<P>
Well, so what? Writer Leinberger argues that a city busily creating itself, 
such as Los Angeles, "doesn't have as much time to worry about national 
trends." But just having like a reputation for excellence in the arts, one mark 
of a world-class city is its influence on the intellectual and political life 
of a nation. After the next congressional reapportionment, California will have 
at least 50 seats in the House of Representatives, more than any state has ever 
had. Can a state so intrinsically powerful remain so essentially voiceless? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. Already, change is stirring. Established institutions such as 
RAND Corp. in Los Angeles and the conservative Hoover Institute in Palo Alto 
have always had a role in national debates; now, newer forces such as the 
Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, the graduate school in 
Pacific Studies at UC San Diego, and New Perspectives Quarterly magazine in Los 
Angeles are providing a California slant on national affairs that challenges 
the picture of the state as a desert when it comes to intellectual life. 
</P>
<P>
Those stereotypes die slowly, but Nathan Gardels, New Perspectives editor, sees 
a gradual westward "tilt" in the nation's center of economic and political 
power that cannot forever be ignored by the East. "For cumulative reasons, 
someone like economist Lester Thurow is at MIT because he wants to be 
influential like anyone else; but at some point, the East becomes so much less 
innovative than the West that it doesn't contribute, it's dead," Gardels says. 
"We have the opposite problem here. We have a lot of innovative thinking. But 
it hasn't been able to jell yet. Once the thinking in the East becomes moribund 
enough, the thinking in the West will get some respect." 
</P>
<P>
That respect is still off somewhere in the future, and it won't be won until 
the encrusted caricatures that define Los Angeles beyond its borders are 
scraped away. It may be that Los Angeles' image will not catch up with its 
reality until the city itself takes the time to remake it.

<P>
ON BEVERLY HILLS SHOPPING EXPEDITION, REPROVISIONING AT RAFFAELE'S IS THE KEY 
TO SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good morning. Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to spend an 
exhausting hour or two shopping at Camp Beverly Hills. Then find a place to 
stoke up on Italian food. 
</P>
<P>
You could walk next door to the Italian sandwich place, of course. But you 
could also walk in the other direction and find Raffaele Ristorante, a much 
more suitable place to examine the fast-lane survival gear that you've dropped 
a bundle on. It's a restaurant of clean modern lines and quiet lighting, and 
paintings that seem at the same time dreamy and wise-cracking. 
</P>
<P>
One gathers that the Raffaele after whom the restaurant is named is the chef, 
but the star is certainly the steel-gray-haired maitre d'. He makes possibly 
the most elaborate caffe alla diavolo in town, which starts with sugar being 
melted over a flame onto the lip of a wineglass and climaxes with burning 
Triple Sec being poured down a spiral of orange peel in a glowing blue cascade. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a particularly attentive maitre d', but what we really need to know 
about is the food. You must have something to eat while you look over your new 
bush jacket and wonder whether the people in the wacky wall paintings would be 
caught dead in anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
OK. There are rather good, deep-fried calamari, abundant and a little al dente 
with some fresh tomato sauce. A sort of polished-up version of eggplant 
Parmesan is called tortino di melanzane, with a lot of cheese and not so much 
tomato sauce as your usual Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
The fried mozzarella is a little salty, exhibiting an occasional vice of this 
kitchen, but nicely crisp. The mushrooms stuffed with crab exhibit a vice that 
this kitchen rarely indulges in, small portions, and it is also rather mildly 
flavored, like some of the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pastas, the house specialty, as the menu points out, is agnolotti 
stuffed with spinach, and ricotta served simply in cream. It's sweet and 
simple, but I far prefer the rugged penne alla contadina, where the pasta is 
mixed with eggplant, peppers, tomato, black olives and capers, a flavorful 
mishmash with a definite jolt of vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
For a few days, there was a nice special of canneloni with a faintly 
spinach-scented veal filling topped with a little tomato sauce and surrounded 
by a cream-and-tomato sauce that was thickly granulated with grated Parmesan, 
also a little salty and roughly flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of grilled meats, such as the lombata, a big veal chop 
slightly charred on the outside, tender, sweet and light pink inside. The meats 
are generally garnished with carrots, peppers, mixed squashes and surprisingly 
al dente mushrooms. There are also some sautees, like perfectly cooked salmon 
with a very delicate, almost evanescent tarragon and onion sauce or chicken 
breasts in a mild mustard and lemon sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Osso buco is as tender as can be in a rich tomato sauce with a hint of the 
garlic and lemon peel flavoring ordinarily added on top. Oddly, however, when I 
ordered it, there was none of the advertised saffron rice but some not-bad 
angel-hair pasta in tomato sauce instead. 
</P>
<P>
The maitre d' makes a couple of desserts at a little gas burner, where he whips 
up a zabaglione with egg-yolk foam that is actually less cloyingly sweet than 
usual. The other specialty dessert is the tirami su, a rather mannered version 
of this simple dessert of ladyfingers mixed with espresso and mascarpone 
cheese, served in a dark chocolate cup. 
</P>
<P>
With this, you're fortified. You're ready for anything. You can go forth and 
spend for hours to come. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: fritto di calamari, $5.50; lombata, $17.95; penne alla 
contadina, $9.50; tirami su, $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ristorante, 9634 Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills. (213) 276- 4466. 
Open for lunch Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.; for dinner Monday

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: BARN DANCE HOST HAILS NEW SITE, PREPARES FOR ANNIVERSARY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After some rocky times and a mid-season club transfer, KCSN's weekly Barn Dance 
will celebrate its first anniversary at North Hollywood's Palomino on Tuesday 
night. And host Ronnie Mack wants more. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility that we might be able to expand to other radio stations 
across the country," Mack said. "There will be meetings in a few weeks to 
discuss that." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Mack is content with the weekly Tuesday night broadcasts, from 
9 p.m. to 11 p.m., on KCSN-FM. The show, Mack said, shifted in August to the 
Palomino from the Little Nashville Club because of inferior sound, insufficient 
space, and problems with management over drinking policies. Mack maintains that 
the move has made a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound at the club and on the radio is much better," Mack said. "We've been 
getting about 300 people each show." 
</P>
<P>
For the anniversary show, performers will include country singer Rosie Flores, 
blues veteran Big Jay McNeely, and Jann Brown and the Eddys, with James 
Intveld. 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Blonde's Johnette Napolitano will perform at McCabe's in Santa Monica 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Napolitano is about to join the band for a six-month world tour, with 
a European swing. Concrete Blonde's debut album in 1986 scored impressively 
with fans and critics, and the group is about to release its newest record. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on the same show will be Bob Forrest and Mike Martt from Felonious 
Monster. The duo has just finished an album, which was produced by X's John 
Doe. 
</P>
<P>
The show will begin at 8 p.m., and tickets cost $12.50. 
</P>
<P>
Also at McCabe's, on Jan. 22, Henry Kaiser and Tom Constanten will perform. 
Kaiser is an experimental guitarist; Constanten will play keyboard. They will 
each give solo performances, then do some songs together. Constanten, who now 
teaches classical keyboard in the San Francisco area, played on the Grateful 
Dead's first three records from 1968 to 1970. He rarely appears in L.A. clubs. 
</P>
<P>
This show also will begin at 8 p.m. and cost $12.50.

JIM CROW'S GHOST LURKS IN NEW SOUTH

<DATELINE>
<P>
CLARKSDALE, Miss. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the third or fourth time that Andy McWilliams had stepped outside the 
bar to see if the mechanic had arrived to take him to his car, disabled on a 
back road about 5 miles from town. McWilliams had called for help more than 
half an hour ago, but there still was no sign of the mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, relax and enjoy your beer," said a friend, a visitor from Atlanta, as 
McWilliams returned to his seat once again. "The guy knows where to find you, 
right? Why don't you just sit tight and let him come in here for you instead of 
going outside to look for him all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams gave his friend a bemused look and then, realizing that the big-city 
visitor did not quite grasp the situation, bluntly explained: " 'Cause he's a 
nigger, and he knows better than to step foot in here. This ain't no redneck 
bar, but niggers ain't exactly welcome." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of Past 
</P>
<P>
Old times are not forgotten in Dixie. The "Whites Only" signs have long been 
retired, "mean" racists are a dying breed and, throughout the region, blacks 
and whites are sharing their lives in ways that earlier generations of 
Southerners would find unimaginable. But, for all the dramatic progress in race 
relations below the Mason-Dixon Line, the South still is plagued by vestiges of 
its Jim Crow past. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the lush, cotton-growing Delta section of northwestern Mississippi, for 
example, many planters still refer to their black field hands as "my people" as 
they once might have said "my niggers" or "my slaves" -- as if they still 
bodily owned them. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when a West Coast reporter visiting the town of Sumner remarked on 
how spruce and prosperous it looked compared to other Delta communities he had 
seen, a prominent white resident unabashedly boasted: "It's because we're 70% 
white here -- and that's the way we want to keep it. You go over to the next 
town, where it's just the reverse, and you'll see what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem of the lingering color line in the South is notconfined to such 
rural and small-town areas as the Mississippi Delta. It can be found, to 
varying degrees, throughout the domain of the Old Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, for instance, has long prided itself as "the city too busy to hate" -- 
a sobriquet it gave itself when other major Southern cities were torn by bitter 
racial strife during the turbulent era of the civil rights struggles. But, 
residentially, Atlanta today is split almost in half racially, with 90% of 
whites living north of downtown and 90% of blacks living to the south, and the 
city's public schools, with a 92% black student enrollment, are among the most 
segregated in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, on the scale of economic equality that Atlanta boasts about, 
blacks often fall woefully behind. For example, an investigative series by the 
Atlanta Journal and Constitution last year disclosed that the city's major 
financial institutions are five times more likely to give mortgage and 
home-improvement loans to whites than to blacks, even though two-thirds of the 
city's residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, we're still confronted with a deep character flaw in the Southern 
white," said Steve Suitts, executive director of the Southern Regional Council, 
an Atlanta-based organization formed in 1944 to foster better race relations in 
the South. "It is that whites, more than 30 years after the U.S. Supreme Court 
struck down the 'separate but equal' doctrine, truly do not believe that race 
is a burden in society. Even the 'city too busy to hate' is not too busy to 
discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Form of Prejudice 
</P>
<P>
Economic discrimination is one of the most persistent forms of anti-black 
prejudice in the South. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report on the "worker climate" in the United States by 
the Atlanta-based Southern Labor Institute, black workers in New England and in 
several Midwestern states have shared substantially along with whites in the 
benefits of economic growth in their localities. But in many Southern states -- 
most notably Alabama, Arkansas and North and South Carolina -- blacks still 
suffer disproportionately from discrimination and poor labor market 
opportunities, despite the economic expansion in their region. 
</P>
<P>
Those four states -- Alabama, Arkansas and the Carolinas -- also are among the 
lowest in terms of the percentage of blacks employed in what traditionally have 
been better-paying, predominantly white-male occupations -- executives, 
administrators, managers and professionals, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"All workers still have reasons to find the South a disappointing, poor place 
to work," said Ken Johnson, the labor institute's director. "But blacks, 
obviously, have even more reasons than whites." 
</P>
<P>
The economic disadvantage from which blacks suffer is perhaps most pronounced 
in rural and small-town Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly publicized 1987 incident in the southern Georgia town of Tifton, 
for example, a black college student was discharged from her job at a 
white-owned pharmacy the day after she started work because a co-owner feared 
that her race would cause him to lose white customers. 
</P>
<P>
The student, Tommie Faye Bateman, was then in her final year at the University 
of Georgia's pharmacy college and was considered by her instructors to be an 
above-average student. She had been assigned to the Cox-Ewing Northside 
Pharmacy as part of the college's program placing students in jobs for 
practical training. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Cox, the business partner who dismissed her, said that the university 
did not inform him beforehand that Bateman was black and that he had overheard 
several white customers complaining about her presence in the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no prejudice at all," he told a reporter at the time of the incident. 
But, he added: "We just don't know how to handle customers complaining. . . . 
It's hard for the small independent businesses to survive. You bend to what 
your customers say." 
</P>
<P>
John Ewing, Cox's partner, offered to rehire Bateman, but she chose 
reassignment to a pharmacy in her hometown of Ashburn, saying: "I never thought 
I would be denied the right to work . . . not after all these years in the 
1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson Henderson, president of the Tifton chapter of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, said he fears that Bateman's dismissal may 
have created the impression among black youngsters that "regardless of how hard 
they work to get ahead, they're still going to be faced with blatant 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
As in the North, much of the continuing racism in the South stems from a 
deep-seated aversion to accepting blacks as social and cultural equals -- an 
aversion reinforced by generations of custom and tradition and, until the 
abolishment of legalized segregation, by the force of law as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, says Lillian Lewis, wife of black Democratic Congressman John 
Lewis, the social hour is rigidly segregated, being either "black or white -- a 
black dance, a white party, a black ball, a white gala." 
</P>
<P>
Even in such supposedly enlightened environs as college campuses, with 
generations of young blacks and whites who did not grow up under Jim Crow, the 
color line is often strongly drawn. 
</P>
<P>
When black co-eds won the homecoming queen crown for two years in a row at the 
University of Alabama, for example, the student senate -- which is dominated by 
white fraternities and sororities -- reacted by voting to change the rules of 
the election of campus homecoming queen. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old rules, the homecoming crown was awarded to the candidate who 
obtained a plurality of the votes cast by the student body. Blacks had an 
advantage in voting because, even though they make up less than 10% of the 
student population, they tended to vote in a bloc for a favored black candidate 
among the 10 finalists selected by a screening committee. Whites, in contrast, 
were inclined to split their vote among the several white candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, which went into effect last fall, a candidate cannot win 
with a simple plurality of the votes; she must get a majority -- at least 50% 
plus one vote. If no candidate obtains a majority in the election, a runoff is 
held between the top two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, what this did is to ensure that no black woman would ever win on 
this campus," said Lee McCarley, editor of the Crimson White, the student 
newspaper. "A black made it to the runoff this year, but she was beaten by an 
Asian-American who is in one of the more affluent white sororities. Once it 
came down to a runoff, the white fraternity and sorority 'machine' bloc simply 
voted for her. They're powerful enough to put in anyone that they wish under 
the new rules." 
</P>
<P>
The student senate's action supports studies by University of Alabama 
sociologist Donal E. Muir showing that white fraternities and sororities are 
"the real stronghold of prejudice against blacks on this campus." 
</P>
<P>
Muir's surveys have found that whites who belong to fraternities and sororities 
are far less willing than other white students to socialize with blacks and 
accept them as equals. Only 32% of white fraternity and sorority members are 
willing to room with a black, compared to slightly more than 50% of white 
independents, and only 8% of white fraternity and sorority members are willing 
to date a black, compared to about 60% of white independents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of Power Elite 
</P>
<P>
"What makes this even more of a problem," Muir explains, "is that the white 
fraternity and sorority members are the ones who, when they graduate from 
college, tend to go out into the general community and become part of the white 
power elite -- the leading business people, the bankers, the politicians. So 
they have an influence far beyond that of their proportionately small numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Public education, the focus of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1954 
abolishing the "separate but equal" doctrine, remains another sore spot in the 
South's race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years in Mississippi, for example, blacks have staged 
boycotts in about 15 different communities to protest alleged discrimination in 
public schools, and they have filed lawsuits against more than 20 of the 
state's 154 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grievances vary from district to district, the lawsuits generally 
include charges of discrimination in hiring and promotion of black teachers and 
administrators, as well as accusations that black students are unfairly 
concentrated in classes for slow learners as a result of abuses in standardized 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Mississippi's 506,000 public school students are black, but 
only 35% of the 10,104 instructional personnel are black. And, although more 
than half of the districts have student populations that range from 70% to 100% 
black, only 22 of the total 165 district superintendents are black, according 
to figures from the state education department and the state NAACP chapter. 
</P>
<P>
White administrators reject charges of discrimination and cite what they term 
the progress in Mississippi since the days when blacks were confined to 
all-black schools with dog-eared textbooks and hand-me-down athletic uniforms 
discarded by white schools. 
</P>
<P>
But Morris Kinsey, director of the state NAACP's education committee, argues 
that white school officials seem intent on "returning to the days of 
segregation" in schools, thus forcing blacks to seek redress through protests 
and lawsuits. "Whites think it's progress if instead of no shoes you have one, 
but in some cases we don't even have one shoe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 incident in rural southeastern Georgia, the black community in Ware 
County was outraged when a white county school bus driver ordered 10 black 
students to sit at the back of the bus for a week because they had skipped 
classes to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver claimed that she put the students in the back of the bus only to 
facilitate loading and unloading of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Convinced 
</P>
<P>
That explanation did not convince many blacks in Ware County, where blacks said 
that they had long suffered indignities in the predominantly white school 
district. On one occasion, during a pep rally at the county high school, two 
cheerleaders reportedly wore blackface and mimicked with exaggerated clumsiness 
the football players from a predominantly black rival school with whom a game 
was set that day. In another incident, blacks said, two white county high 
school students donned sheets and hoods resembling Ku Klux Klan robes for an 
annual Toga Day event. 
</P>
<P>
The district school board rejected black demands that the bus driver be 
dismissed but voted to make King's birthday a school holiday. That may serve to 
mollify blacks, but it is unlikely to do much else to improve race relations, 
since Southern whites generally ignore King's birthday as a "black" holiday 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most difficult parts of our life in the South is that a lot of 
whites are living without a sense of history," said Suitts of the Southern 
Regional Council. "Anybody who understands the history of the South and thought 
for a moment would consider what sending blacks to the back of the bus 
symbolically says." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "That's the lingering difficulty in moving this region -- and 
the nation -- beyond the current stagnated state of race relations. The general 
view today -- you can hear it in every coffee shop in the morning -- is: 'I 
didn't create slavery, I didn't create segregation, I didn't create racism, so 
why do these folks want me to do something?' " 
</P>
<P>
One of the most disturbing aspects of the South's continuing racial dilemmas is 
the persistence of the Ku Klux Klan and its many latter-day offshoots, such as 
the White Patriots Party and the Mississippi-based Nationalist Movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, a renewed growth of the klan and the other white supremacist 
organizations occurred nationwide, but the resurgence of the klan itself peaked 
earlier in this decade, and membership has dwindled from a high of between 
10,000 to 12,000 in 1981 to about 6,000 or 7,000 at present, according to 
various estimates. 
</P>
<P>
However, although the traditional klan has lost membership, there is strong 
evidence that membership in other white supremacist organizations has grown, so 
that the total figure for all white supremacist groups could be as high as 
20,000 or more, according to Eva Sears of the Atlanta-based Center for 
Democratic Renewal, which monitors hate group activity in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Sophisticated 
</P>
<P>
"What's even more disturbing is that the white supremacists have learned to be 
a lot more subtle and sophisticated, and they are concentrating on influencing 
young people," she said. "And, for our tastes, they're doing it much too 
successfully." 
</P>
<P>
The klan staged its 55th annual rally last September at its traditional spot 
near Stone Mountain in suburban Atlanta. The rally was held on land owned by 
klan leader James R. Venable. Earlier in the year, the Stone Mountain City 
Council had approved a proposal to name a local ballpark after Venable, a 
former mayor of the town, but it later repealed the action after incurring a 
flood of negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"The klan has lost force in that a lot of their illegal actions are no longer 
tolerated the way they used to be," Sears said. "But they still pose a threat 
because of their potential to polarize and terrorize communities far beyond 
what might be expected if you judged from their size alone." 
</P>
<P>
Another enduring source of racial division in the South is its Confederate 
heritage. In Montgomery, Ala., the self-styled "Cradle of the Confederacy," 14 
black state legislators were arrested for trespassing on state property last 
summer when they attempted to scale a chain-link fence and remove the Rebel 
banner that flies from the dome of the State Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see that flag, I see the banner of a traitor nation that wanted to hold 
my forebears in slavery," said seven-term state Rep. Alvin Holmes of 
Montgomery, who was among the lawmakers who were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noble Cause 
</P>
<P>
But to many white Southerners the "Stars and Bars" is a symbol of what they see 
as a noble cause and laudable heritage. "I'm glad they zapped those niggers 
when they tried to take that flag down. It's not anti-black," said a white 
Montgomery bartender. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, racism remains a salient issue for the South -- as, in fact, it does 
for the nation. Many Southerners -- whites as well as blacks -- believe that 
the South is sliding backward in its efforts to achieve a truly biracial 
society and that neither the North nor the federal government provides the 
moral imperative they once did for change below the Mason-Dixon Line. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as white Southerners can look at Yonkers or Howard Beach or Chicago, 
it's going to be hard to solve the South's racial problems," said James Cobb, a 
University of Alabama historian, referring to Northern localities that have 
experienced severe racial conflict and violence in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the Reconstruction era following the Civil War. Reconstruction plays 
out when it reaches a point where it tries to push the South to a point beyond 
where the nation as a whole wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cobb said: "We'll know that the South's race problem is solved when, 
as the Southern writer Walker Percy once said, a white Southerner hears about a 
racial problem in a Northern city and is sad about it instead of gloating."

FRAUD MAY HAVE BIG ROLE IN S&amp;L FAILURES, GAO SAYS 
</P>

<P>
A massive wave of fraud and other criminal behavior may have played a much 
bigger role in the financial collapse of hundreds of savings and loan 
associations than has previously been disclosed, the General Accounting Office 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an intensive investigation of a group of failed S&amp;Ls, including some of 
the largest, the GAO found that fraud or insider abuse existed in every case, 
GAO official Frederick D. Wolf said during a hearing here of the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the GAO report implies that the massive wave of collapses in the 
U.S. savings and loan industry will be viewed ultimately as the biggest 
white-collar crime in history. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, federal regulators have insisted that fraud was a problem, but only 
a minor issue compared with the collapse of oil prices and real estate values 
in Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall told Congress last week 
that fraud apparently was involved in just 20% or 25% of thrift failures. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolf, previewing for the congressional committee a GAO report that will be 
issued soon, said Friday that illegal behavior was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraud or insider abuse existed at each and every one of the failed thrifts 
(surveyed)," said Wolf, who is director of the accounting and financial 
management division of the GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities combined with the impact of an economic slump to drive 
S&amp;Ls into financial collapse. Honestly run S&amp;Ls, by contrast, weathered 
the economic slump. As the report puts it: "On the other hand, many thrifts 
which operated prudently survived the same adverse conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The pervasiveness of corruption was uncovered in the GAO's review of 26 
institutions from among the 284 failed or failing S&amp;Ls that were merged, 
liquidated or helped by federal regulators between the beginning of 1985 and 
Sept. 30, 1987. The companies in the sample accounted for $11.4 billion in 
losses to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. fund, or 57% of the 
losses incurred by the fund in connection with all 284 cases. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 companies were not identified, Wolf said, because disclosure could 
jeopardize "the government's efforts to seek recoveries in civil suits or to 
prosecute alleged criminal acts." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf added that the federal bailouts of insolvent thrifts last year may only 
worsen the crisis. He said the sale of the thrifts to private investors could 
cost the taxpayers more than if the government had simply closed the 
institutions and paid off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board provided more than $37 billion in federal notes and tax breaks 
to private investors who agreed to take over insolvent thrifts in 1988. But 
Wolf said the actual cost of the deals may be closer to $50 billion by the time 
all the notes are paid off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious reservations' 
</P>
<P>
"We also have serious reservations about whether these assistance actions will 
result in permanent solutions or simply prolong the problem and increase its 
ultimate cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness, James Cirona, president of the San Francisco Home Loan Bank, 
told the committee that the FBI and the Justice Department need more money to 
pursue white-collar criminals in the savings and loan business. 
</P>
<P>
"Judges must take these crimes more seriously and sentence convicted felons to 
substantial prison terms," Cirona said. "Some sentences in this district have 
been scandalously weak. We must deter future looting of thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) asked witness Larry Taggart, who served as 
California savings and loan commissioner during a period of major savings and 
loan growth in 1983 and 1984: "How did all these crooks get into the S&amp;L 
industry in the state?" 
</P>
<P>
Taggart responded, "I'd have to have your definition of a crook." Taggart said 
many of the industry's problems could have been managed except that federal 
regulators acted too quickly in closing down troubled institutions. "There was 
a tremendous amount of seizure mania," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry observers say just the opposite -- that many thrifts were allowed 
to remain alive long after it was clear that they would never return to 
profitability. The losses such companies continued to accumulate, these critics 
say, greatly intensified the crisis in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter Distributed 
</P>
<P>
The committee distributed a letter that Taggart wrote in 1986, when he was a 
private consultant, appealing to White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan for 
help against federal S&amp;L regulators. The bank board's actions "are likely 
to have a very adverse impact on the ability of our party to raise needed 
campaign funds in the upcoming elections," Taggart's letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Taggart said he sent the letter because federal regulators were acting unfairly 
toward the industry, especially in Texas.

BLACK LEADERS REBUKE REAGAN FOR TV REMARKS 
</P>

<P>
President Reagan, in a television interview to be broadcast today, takes a jab 
at prominent but unnamed black leaders, charging that they "are doing very 
well" by "keeping alive the feeling that they're victims of prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his low standing among black Americans, Reagan blames "this 
editorializing comment (by black leaders) that somehow I'm on the other side" 
of the struggle for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggravates Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's comments, in his final days in office and on the weekend of the Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, aggravated a dispute between the President and 
prominent blacks, a controversy that has festered through his eight years in 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks drew immediate criticism from some black leaders, including the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said that Reagan "may be the worst civil rights 
President we've had in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
In his interview on the CBS-TV program "60 Minutes," the President did not 
defend his civil rights record in the White House, but he instead referred to 
his earlier days to demonstrate his support for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"As a sports announcer, when blacks were denied the right to play major league 
baseball, I was one of the little group in the nation that editorialized 
constantly that they shouldn't be, that they should be allowed to participate 
in sports," Reagan said. "As governor of California, I appointed more blacks to 
executive and policy-making positions in government than all the previous 
governors of California put together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Give Names 
</P>
<P>
CBS correspondent Mike Wallace asked Reagan if he were referring to such black 
leaders as Jackson or Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, but the President demurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you name the names. I won't," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Responding in an interview on CNN Saturday, Jackson said that Reagan's 
challenge to "the integrity of civil rights leaders is a diversion. . . . He 
really has been a rich man's President, with gross insensitivity toward basic 
civil rights for those who have been historically denied." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cite Rebukes, Record 
</P>
<P>
While the President has blamed his troubles with blacks on prominent civil 
rights leaders, many blacks say that Reagan's personal rebukes, combined with 
his Administration's civil rights record, have earned their enmity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is totally uncalled for. Rather than provide some positive leadership on 
civil rights, he (Reagan) has chosen to make this kind of nasty comment about 
prominent blacks who have devoted their entire careers to promoting civil 
rights," said William L. Robinson, dean of the District of Columbia Law School. 
"I think it is unworthy of a President to denigrate people of this stature by a 
snide suggestion that they are in this for personal financial gain." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's remarks recalled for some his 1983 comment implying that King may have 
been a communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
After the Senate voted overwhelmingly to honor King with a national holiday, 
Reagan said he would reluctantly sign the legislation. But he also praised the 
"sincerity" of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.), who had argued that the Senate 
should not approve the holiday until it could examine sealed FBI files on King. 
Helms said the files may show King was a communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we'll know in about 35 years, won't we?" Reagan said at a news 
conference when asked about Helms' assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of remark, about a true black hero, has typified his presidency for 
many blacks," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anger Traced to Carolina Case 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Reagan White House aroused the anger of civil rights activists 
when it moved to reverse a 12-year-old Internal Revenue Service policy so as to 
grant a tax exemption to Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a private 
institution that excluded blacks. However, the Administration was rebuffed by 
the Supreme Court on an 8-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration also opposed an extension of the Voting Rights Act, 
moved to dismantle court decrees desegregating public schools and fought 
against affirmative action for minorities and women. In each instance, the 
Administration's efforts were rebuked by Congress or the Supreme Court.

Members of a band of Chippewa Indians in Mole Lake, Wis., voted against a state 
proposal for a $10-million buyout to limit the band's hunting and fishing 
treaty rights. Arlyn Ackley, tribal chairman, said the vote was 131-24 against 
the proposal. The state's offer called for paying $1.25 million the first year 
and $1 million a year for the next nine years, he said. In exchange, the band 
would give up treaty spearfishing rights, except for certain ceremonial 
purposes, and lumbering rights on non-reservation public lands. The money would 
have financed the band's tribal administration, economic development projects 
and health and welfare programs.

Bolivian police said former President Luis Garcia Meza escaped from house 
arrest to duck charges he tried to peddle the stolen diaries of famed Cuban 
guerrilla commander Ernesto (Che) Guevara. Authorities said they went to the 
former dictator's home in the colonial city of Sucre on Friday after Congress 
charged him with stealing the diaries but could not find him. Guevara, perhaps 
the world's most famous guerrilla commander and trusted right hand of Fidel 
Castro, died from wounds suffered in a gun battle in Churo, Bolivia on Oct. 8, 
1967. Soldiers seized the Guevara diaries, which were then placed in an army 
strongbox, only to show up at a London auction house in 1984 where they were 
put up for sale for $300,000.

A four-lane bridge, the only direct link between Pensacola and suburban Gulf 
Breeze, Fla., and used by thousands of commuters daily, was knocked out of 
operation when a barge slammed into a concrete pillar supporting the center of 
the 3-mile structure, knocking the pillar into the water. The bridge was clear 
of traffic at the time and no injuries were reported. It will remain closed to 
traffic for three weeks. The only other land access is a detour of about 60 
miles. Officials said it was not known why the barge was unable to navigate 
away from the pillar.

Warning that the competitive status of the United States is at stake, a group 
of educators urged U.S. colleges to coax more business and science majors and 
less-affluent students to take part in study-abroad programs. The Council on 
International Educational Exchange said colleges should encourage students to 
attend schools in Latin America, Asia and Africa, and not just England or other 
Western countries. Fewer than 5% of U.S. college students, or about 50,000, 
study abroad each year, while about 350,000 foreign students attend U.S. 
schools, the council said. The report said that only 3% of U.S. high school 
graduates and 5% of college graduates have proficiency in a second language, 
that 33 states do not require foreign language study in high school and that 34 
states do not require world history in high school.

The two engines of a Boeing 737 jet that crashed in central England were 
shipped to France, where they will be stripped down in an effort to determine 
the cause of the crash. The British Midland Airways plane, flying from London 
to Belfast, Northern Ireland, crashed onto an embankment of England's M1 
highway last weekend, killing 44 people. Early investigations showed the left 
engine had been on fire but that an apparently good right engine had been shut 
down. The engines were manufactured jointly by General Electric and a French 
firm.

Florida lawmakers met with hundreds of Nicaraguan immigrants living at a 
stadium in Miami to pledge support, but they warned that funds to help them 
find jobs and homes "don't come easily." Newly elected Republicans Sen. Connie 
Mack and Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. and Mayor Xavier Suarez visited the Bobby Maduro 
Miami Stadium to examine the problems facing the growing number of Nicaraguan 
arrivals. A total of 263 Nicaraguans are living at the stadium. Shaw vowed to 
help "so that Miami won't have to take on alone the financial burden of these 
new refugee arrivals." Miami officials have said that the latest wave of 
Nicaraguans will overburden schools and hospitals. The Central Americans began 
arriving from South Texas last week, after a federal judge in Texas ruled that 
the federal government could not keep them there while their applications for 
political asylum were being processed.

Four leaders of the French terrorist group Direct Action were sentenced to life 
imprisonment for the 1986 murder of Renault chairman Georges Besse. A 
seven-judge panel convicted Nathalie Menigon, 31, and Joelle Aubron, 29, of 
shooting the industrialist outside his Paris home. Jean-Marc Rouillan, 36, and 
Georges Cipriani, 38, were convicted as accomplices. The court recommended that 
the two women and two men serve a minimum of 18 years. Direct Action took 
responsibility for Besse's killing, saying he was a symbol of imperialism.

A state appellate court opinion has restricted a Kern County school district's 
ability to ban two books from its curriculum and said the school board had no 
authority to ban the books if the decision was based on religious grounds. The 
case stems from a 1986 lawsuit filed by English teacher Lee McCarthy against 
school administrators and Wasco Union High School District's Board of Trustees 
after the principal said "Grendel" by John Gardner and "One Hundred Years of 
Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez could no longer be used in school. A school 
administrator had expressed concerns about the books' vulgarity and profanity, 
and described "Grendel" as "anti-God, anti-religion and anti-personal dignity." 
The Court of Appeal reinstated the lawsuit, which had been dismissed in 1987 by 
a Kern County judge, and held that the school board had no authority to ban the 
books based on religious grounds.

Zaire has begun looking for a home for deposed Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, 
saying his presence could harm relations with neighboring Uganda. "Zaire will 
do everything to find a solution to this, to say the least, embarrassing 
presence in an attempt to safeguard its good neighborly relations," a Foreign 
Ministry statement said. Amin, 61, was deported by Zaire on Thursday, but 
returned when Saudi Arabia, where he had lived in exile since his overthrow in 
1979, refused to readmit him. Uganda wants to question Amin about thousands of 
deaths during his 8-year regime, but Zaire has declined to send him there.

At least two British soldiers were injured in two separate bomb blasts in 
Northern Ireland, police said. One soldier was injured in West Belfast when a 
bomb was detonated as a military patrol passed along Andersonstown Park, a 
Roman Catholic area, a police spokesman said. A second soldier was injured in 
the northern city of Londonderry when a bomb went off in Butcher Street, also a 
Catholic area. Meanwhile, in the northern village of Crumlin, police foiled a 
bomb attack on an unmanned police station after opening fire on a group of 
people who had been acting suspiciously, authorities said. An army expert 
defused a device containing 2.2 pounds of explosive found after the men fled 
from the scene. One woman was arrested at the scene.

Data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation show that the selenium-tainted 
Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge may remain dangerous for migratory birds for 
years to come, according to federal biologists. In a 1988 monitoring report, 
the agency said birds at the western Merced County site still have high enough 
levels of the trace element to trigger mutations, and food chain items still 
contain selenium levels far in excess of the recommended safety limit of 3 
parts per million. In addition, two of 11 coyotes from the site showed signs of 
poisoning. The Kesterson Reservoir served as an evaporation pond for drainage 
water from the 5,900-acre Westlands Water District from 1978 until 1986, when 
drain water flows were halted because of the elevated levels of selenium.

REAGAN LOG EXPORT PLAN IRKS FIRMS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</P>

<P>
Timber companies, environmentalists and unions, traditional foes in debates 
over the nation's resources, are combining to oppose President Reagan's 
deficit-cutting plan to allow raw-log exports from national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments along the West Coast are also lining up against the plan, 
which could help reduce the nation's trade and budget deficits by abandoning a 
20-year congressional ban blocking foreign buyers from bidding on timber grown 
on federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to lift the log-export ban is a part of Reagan's proposed 1989 
budget, which includes federal log exports among dozens of innovative ways to 
raise federal revenue without raising taxes. A Forest Service spokesman said he 
expects President-elect Bush to embrace the idea as well. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was initiated by former Sen. Wayne L. Morse, an Oregon Democrat, as a 
way to assure some log supply for lumber mills in the Pacific Northwest that 
were threatened by the growing export of uncut timber to Japan and other Asian 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to protecting their own millers, importing countries prefer raw 
logs because they can be custom cut to each country's size and quality 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
However, since 1968 only private timberland owners have been free to export 
logs, and exporters are not allowed to bid on federal timber sales. Because of 
these restrictions, federal timber can sell for 25% less than private logs. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials believe that lifting the export ban will boost prices for 
federal stumpage, or standing trees, and should add $100 million a year to the 
Treasury. U.S. Forest Service budget analyst Bob Gordon said expanded exports 
also should trim the nation's trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the plan is just as likely to force private timberland 
owners to lower their prices to compete with the higher-quality wood generally 
available in national forests. If, on the other hand, prices do rise, mills in 
the West, from which most exports likely would come, would be at a competitive 
disadvantage in the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be unsupportable all the way around, but for that price tag" and 
the benefits to the Treasury, said Kevin Lynch, an aide to Rep. Les AuCoin 
(D-Ore.). 
</P>
<P>
AuCoin, who has said the proposal could cost 2,500 jobs in Oregon alone, is one 
of several congressmen from the Pacific Northwest who sit on the House and 
Senate appropriations committees, which would have to approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Ted W. Nelson, vice president at the Weyerhaeuser Co. in Washington, said a 
sudden lifting of the export ban could cause "serious disruptions" all along 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We're faced with a shortage of logs now for mills," he said, speaking of the 
lumber industry in general. "We have mills that are going out of business right 
now because they cannot find a reliable and adequate supply of logs." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Doerner of the Assn. of O&amp;C Counties, a collection of local governments 
in rural Oregon counties formerly owned by the Oregon and California Railroad, 
said promises of more local tax revenue from greater exports would not make up 
for the wrenching dislocations that widespread mill closings would have. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe this is going to go through," he said. "It impacts too many 
people locally." 
</P>
<P>
It also could affect home buyers, remodelers and others throughout the West, he 
added. "The shortage of raw material here would boost the price of the end 
product," Doerner said. "My own opinion is that everyone loses." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon of the Forest Service conceded that Reagan's plan "is going to hurt 
domestic processing," but pointed out that it would help people in the export 
field, such as shippers and longshoremen. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know really what all of the substitution effects are," he said. "We 
don't yet have any models on all of that."

PHYSICIAN, HEAL THYSELF -- TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP

When the patient walked into the room and explained his problem, Dr. Marie 
Pitaro knew she should probably spend more time with him to try to figure out 
exactly what ailed him. 
</P>
<P>
But, concluding that the patient's complaints about anxiety could wait, Pitaro 
instead asked him to make an appointment to come back another time. 
</P>
<P>
Pitaro, 36, had been working for more than 30 hours at Boston City Hospital 
with virtually no sleep and just wanted to go home and go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time my sympathy level was pretty low," said Pitaro, who is in the 
third and last year of her post-medical school training as an internist. "I was 
just so exhausted and frazzled." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Allan Hamilton, 37, in the sixth year of a seven-year neurosurgery training 
program at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells stories about residents 
literally falling asleep in the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen residents fall asleep holding a retractor. I've seen a resident fall 
asleep looking through a microscope during microsurgery," Hamilton said. "There 
have been occasions when I've felt I was less sharp then I would like to have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Such incidents illustrate what has become the center of a debate among medical 
educators that could lead to dramatic changes in a time-honored rite of passage 
that doctors have gone through to train for their profession. 
</P>
<P>
New York is scheduled next spring to become the first state to implement 
regulations limiting the number of hours that can be worked by doctors in 
training -- known as house officers, residents, interns and fellows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programs Scrutinized 
</P>
<P>
The move has prompted state officials and medical educators nationwide to 
scrutinize their training programs. Legislation similar to that approved in New 
York is pending in several states, including Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that should have been done a long time ago," said Dr. David 
Daigneault, president of the National Federation of House-staff Organizations, 
which represents some of the estimated 60,000 residents at 1,300 teaching 
hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Medicine has changed over the past 20 years in leaps and bounds. Future shock 
has taken hold in medicine as much as with any scientific field. But residency 
hasn't changed one bit," Daigneault said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the grueling hours most residency programs demand. Young doctors 
routinely work between 80 and 100 hours a week and often go for days with 
little or no sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Because these are the people providing most of the care to patients in 
hospitals, many question whether the approach compromises the quality of care. 
They also question whether this is really the best way to train doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that long hours are necessary to provide young doctors with the 
experience they require to become good doctors, and to get them used to what 
life will be like as physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The training is taxing, but patient care is always the top priority, with 
residents always being backed up by more experienced doctors, they argue. 
Strict regulations would also most likely require the hiring of more staff, 
which would be very costly in these days of spiraling costs, they say. 
</P>
<P>
But even Pitaro and Hamilton disagree. Pitaro supports state legislation to 
limit the number of hours to force hospitals to hire personnel to take some of 
the less specialized work off the backs of residents. Hamilton believes patient 
care would be endangered and fears that changes would diminish or extend his 
training. 
</P>
<P>
The current system for training doctors dates back to the days when hospitals 
were places where most patients were convalescing and required relatively 
little attention. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in medicine have filled hospital wards with very sick patients who 
require intense care. So the same number of patients require much more work to 
care for. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days there was old Mr. Jones dying quietly in the back room and 
there wasn't much you could do," said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New 
England Journal of Medicine. "But today the good old days don't apply anymore. 
In the good old days you could get plenty of sleep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working All Night 
</P>
<P>
When a resident is on call at night -- which can be every few days -- it is 
routine for that person to be up all night, admitting new patients and making 
critical decisions about patients who have been in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the arguments that the system needs changing is the image of a 
relatively inexperienced doctor making important decisions in the middle of the 
night or the day after a sleepless night when his or her mind is foggy. 
</P>
<P>
There are regulations requiring proper sleep for truck drivers and airline 
pilots, proponents of change argue. So shouldn't the same types of common-sense 
rules apply to doctors? 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees. Many argue that residents can adequately care for 
patients with little or no sleep. When the pressure is on, the doctor is revved 
up by adrenaline and is careful to check and double-check his or her decisions, 
they argue. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to use some common sense in this situation," said Dr. Richard Cohen, 
a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who recently 
wrote "House Officer," a book about residents' experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"What these people say is, 'Sure it's no fun. But when you're sleep-deprived on 
the next day you know it. So you watch yourself. You don't take chances. You 
don't run risks,' " Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15-Hour Days 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton routinely works 15-hour days that consist largely of eight- to 10-hour 
stints in the operating room without a break -- even to go to the bathroom. 
These days make up 80- to 120-hour weeks during which he is on call every third 
night. On those nights he often gets little or no sleep. 
</P>
<P>
But he agrees that when it comes time to perform, he and his colleagues are 
certain they can. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're operating there's a lot of adrenaline flowing," Hamilton said. 
"It's sort of like rock climbing. Nobody's going to fall asleep when they're 
climbing a rock face." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hamilton admitted there can be a macho attitude in residency programs 
-- especially surgical residencies -- most residents know enough to admit when 
they are too tired to perform safely. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to lie to you. There's a real macho mentality about surgery. But 
I've never had someone tell me I couldn't leave an operating room because I'm 
too tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Still Function 
</P>
<P>
A study of 26 residents published last summer in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. looked at just this question. It concluded that the scant sleep 
residents get does not impair their ability to function well. 
</P>
<P>
Sleep experts, however, criticized the findings, questioning the methods the 
researchers used. And many medical experts scoff at the notion that lack of 
sleep has no impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows there comes a point when you've worked too long and been 
deprived of sleep so much that it affects your functioning," Relman said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitaro and Hamilton agreed that in most cases chronic fatigue does not cause 
life-threatening mistakes. More likely it slows routine tasks or diminishes a 
resident's ability to be as patient and sympathetic as he or she should be. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that resistance to changing the system stems from tradition akin to 
fraternity initiation or the boot camp experience of the military. Some older 
doctors who are in decision-making positions think new doctors should go 
through what they went through. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it is there's a rite of passage in medicine. The internship is 
considered one of these sacred rites of passage you have to go through to be 
considered a man of medicine," said Dr. Joseph Flaherty, a professor of 
psychiatry at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, who is 
critical of such arguments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Observation 
</P>
<P>
But some educators argue that doctors in training need to see the various 
stages of disease first-hand. And a sick patient's progress does not fit nicely 
into an eight-hour day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only by giving that care, seeing it's response, measuring it . . . that 
one can learn to be a good doctor," said Dr. Robert McAfee, a Portland, Me., 
surgeon and a member of the AMA's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
But others counter that residents do not need to be sleep-deprived to gain 
experience with diseases in all their manifestations. They can be scheduled to 
work various hours, but in such a way that they get the rest they need. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to set up schedules that will give you a reasonable chance that the 
people involved will be physically and emotionally capable of taking care of a 
patient," said Dr. Bertrand Bell, who chaired a commission that recommended the 
changes in New York. "If you think that 80 hours a week is not a lot of hours, 
you're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hands-On Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Another argument for the existing system is that the best way to learn is 
through experience, to treat as many patients as you can and, say, in surgery, 
perform as many operations as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he was concerned that if the number of hours a resident could 
work was limited, already long residency programs like his would have to be 
made even longer. 
</P>
<P>
But again, proponents of change counter that while such experience is 
invaluable, there has to be a limit and a balance that does not compromise 
patient care. And how much can you actually learn when you're tired? 
</P>
<P>
"When you are really tired all you want to do is get out of the hospital, go 
home and get into your bed. It's an overwhelming need to go to sleep. You kind 
of go on automatic pilot. Your interest in learning about the disease process 
is just not there after 36 hours," Pitaro said. 
</P>
<P>
But some also argue that if someone can not handle the long, demanding hours of 
residency, they may not be cut out to be a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something. If you can't handle 80 hours a week you're in 
trouble. And if you can't handle sleep deprivation you're in trouble," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said: "It gives you a chance to really test yourself, to really see 
what you can deliver under the most trying circumstances. It's a trial by fire, 
a trial by combat. When it's over, I think you emerge as a better surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
McAfee also argues that there are other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are certain aspects of the residency training program that 
establish lifelong habits -- being able to say that patients' care is more than 
important than their own individual well-being," said McAfee. 
</P>
<P>
But Pitaro and others say that if hospitals hired more support staff, residents 
would be freed from such work as taking blood and transporting patients, and 
they would have more time to rest and learn. 
</P>
<P>
But even most supporters of the current system admit that some changes could be 
made; some programs are worse than others and the demands vary from specialty 
to specialty. 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn. is in the middle of a comprehensive study of 
residency training programs, examining a wide variety of factors such as 
differences by region, hospitals and specialty, McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommendations Sought 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to be completed by June, after which recommendations will 
be issued for any changes to the various committees that oversee accrediting 
residency programs for each specialty nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We've long had concerns for residents working too hard. But we are not making 
recommendations to anyone until these studies are done," McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
Many also expressed concern about paying for any changes in the system. 
Limiting hours will in all likelihood require the hiring of more doctors, 
nurses and technicians. The changes being made in New York may cost as much as 
$300 million a year in that state alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are under a serious enough problem as it is. Their backs are to the 
wall. It simply makes no sense to institute any kind of reform in house 
officers' working hours that's going to significantly increase costs without 
considering the impact on the hospital. You can't get blood from a stone," 
Relman said. 
</P>
<P>
Relman also expressed concern about state governments stepping in and ordering 
strict limits on hours, saying that medicine varies so much from specialty to 
specialty that such decisions are best left to educators. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me dubious that the problem is best solved by interference by 
state government by legislative fiat," Relman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of government ought to be simply to require that hospitals indicate 
that they are doing something about it and report what they do," he said. "You 
can't fit them all into the same cookie cutter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skepticism Voiced 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Jonathan House, executive director of the committee of interns and 
residents in New York, said he was skeptical that the medical profession would 
ever reform itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Reform is not going to come from the profession. Reform is not going to come 
from the same people who have been denying there is a problem," House said. "If 
war is too important to be left to generals, health is too important to be left 
to doctors." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn argues that his research found residents were more concerned with 
improving the amount and quality of supervision they received than with 
reducing their hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Over and over and over again that's what I heard from these people," Cohen 
said. "Yes, who wants to work 100 hours a week? But if we had teachers who were 
interested in us, I would give 150%." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Delbanco, who heads the general medicine training program at Beth 
Israel Hospital in Boston, said his hospital is experimenting with an approach 
aimed at reducing residents' workloads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separating Patients 
</P>
<P>
The approach involves moving patients who are awaiting transfer, perhaps to a 
nursing home, to a ward where residents do not treat them. These patients are 
of limited educational value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may end up that if we can free up enough of the house officers' time we 
could have them working fewer hours," Delbanco said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very complicated education issue. There is no question that it is 
unreasonable to have young people who are exhausted, who can't think straight, 
attending to the needs of patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, learning to be a doctor has to be an extraordinarily 
intense experience. From the point of view of learning to be a doctor, the more 
time one spends with patients the better," Delbanco said. "The trick is to find 
the proper balance."

A WAY TO STOP LEAKS: 'SUPER-WEATHERIZING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the energy-saving techniques for residences that have sprung up in 
recent years, the one that is perhaps the least known, but most effective, is 
"super-weatherizing," an approach long used by the military to save money on 
the heating and cooling of barracks. 
</P>
<P>
The technique involves testing for drafts and leaks using a powerful fan that 
sucks air through a home as a technician uses a "smoke wand" to check for 
drafts and leaks. Leaks are found when the meandering smoke veers toward the 
fan. Typically, leaks occur along baseboards, plumbing leading into walls, 
ductwork, electrical outlets and badly sealed doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Southern California Edison Co. conducts "energy audits" of homes 
without ever setting foot inside them. Residents are asked a number of 
questions, such as whether they have wrapped their water heater with an 
insulator blanket, or whether there is insulation in the attic. They are 
advised to buy the missing items and can qualify for rebates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far From Effective 
</P>
<P>
Such arms-length techniques are far from effective, according to energy expert 
Amory Lovins, because they do not detect unseen leaks that force residents to 
repeatedly reheat or recool new air constantly entering the home. 
</P>
<P>
"All cities leak like sieves, and there's simply no reason for it," Lovins 
said. "We could cut electricity use in this country by three-quarters, and we 
know how to do it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Under a little-publicized program supported by the Federal National Mortgage 
Assn. (Fannie Mae), potential home buyers can apply for extra money in their 
mortgage loans to pay for "super-weatherizing" them. Hundreds of homes in 
Southern California have been weatherized this way at a cost of about $2,500 to 
$3,500 each, with a typical pay-back of about three years. After that, the 
homeowner enjoyes permanent and dramatic savings. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hall, owner of H&amp;L Energy Savers Inc. in Upland, which sells 
"super-weatherizing," said home buyers find that the extra debt adds about $20 
to $30 to their monthly mortgage, but the typical home immediately saves $40 to 
$50 a month on heating and cooling costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Save Tremendously 
</P>
<P>
"How long are people in Southern California going to pour a $100 bottle of 
Champagne into a glass with 50 holes in it?" Hall asked. "People say you only 
need that in Maine or Pennsylvania -- but people can save tremendously on air 
conditioning and on heat, so you benefit during two different seasons." 
</P>
<P>
A "super-weatherized" house, which includes wall and attic insulation, allows 
its entire air volume to be exchanged, through normal leakage, once every two 
hours. The Environmental Protection Agency considers that movement of air 
sufficient to avoid indoor pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Most homes in Southern California, Hall said, typically lose a houseful of air 
more than once each hour -- the equivalent of having a window open at all 
times. Worse, during a 20-m.p.h. wind, most homes lose about 15 to 20 housefuls 
of air each hour. 
</P>
<P>
Although the utility companies do not offer rebates for "super-weatherizing," 
the technique has been endorsed by Century 21, a real estate firm, which is 
promoting the mortgage loans in a brochure developed with Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THROUGH THE ROOF 
</P>
<P>
 Where a typical Southern California house leaks energy year-round (heated or 
cooled air): 
</P>
<P>
Non-insulated attic 15% 
</P>
<P>
Non-insulated walls 20-30% 
</P>
<P>
Non-insulated floors 20-30% 
</P>
<P>
Windows 15% 
</P>
<P>
Gaps and leaks * 40% to 50% 
</P>
<P>
* Gaps and leaks, which are difficult to detect without a special smoke wand 
and wind generator, are the most significant source of energy loss. They most 
often include poorly sealed baseboards and attic hatches, plumbing openings in 
walls, ductwork rips and cracks, electrical outlet gaps, poorly closing 
fireplace dampers and brickwork gaps, and ill-fitting doors and windows.

EPILEPSY IN YOUNG: EARLY TREATMENT FOUND ESSENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Some children may become suddenly unresponsive once in while, staring blankly. 
Then, they may begin chewing and repeating odd, mechanical motions. Some may 
try to take off their clothes or run and flail at restraint. Others simply may 
suffer sudden falls for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Such confusing behavior may last for just moments and go unnoticed, or result 
in ridicule from other children and punishment from adults, who misinterpret it 
as a discipline problem. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp-eyed day-care providers, teachers and parents should suspect epilepsy, an 
unfortunately common neurological disorder that often responds well to early 
treatment. It need not limit the child's activities or education. 
</P>
<P>
This disorder is produced by brief changes in the brain's electrical system due 
to a sudden increase in the amount of energy passing between cells in one small 
area of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Recently reported studies have shown that many in the early stages of epilepsy 
can discontinue all medication entirely once they have been treated and free of 
seizures for at least two years. Left untreated, they risk developing a more 
severe disorder in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. E. H. Reynolds of Kings College Hospital and Medical School in London 
reports that unless a person's seizures are controlled within the first two 
years of onset, they may not ever be controlled. The reasons for this pattern, 
observed in a 10-year study, are not understood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Early Treatment Important' 
</P>
<P>
"Early treatment is very important," Reynolds said, adding that the interplay 
between natural remission and the medication is unclear. "But there seems to be 
little doubt that drugs play a major role in the high remission rates," he 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
In a few pediatric cases where standard treatment fails, a high-fat, 
high-calorie diet helps. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, a teacher is the first person to pick up on subtle symptoms of 
epilepsy," said Epilepsy Foundation of America spokeswoman Nancy Hembree. 
</P>
<P>
The Landover, Md.-based EFA recently produced a poster and revised pamphlet to 
help teachers and others who work with the public know the best responses to a 
seizure as well as how to recognize a potential problem. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the stereotype, epilepsy does not always involve a "fit," a term 
which wrongly suggests mental derangement. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 20 different types of seizures, ranging in severity as well 
as frequency, and an estimated one person in 100 has recurring ones. About 
750,000 of the more than 2 million people with epilepsy are children and 
teen-agers, Hembree said. 
</P>
<P>
A Grand Mal seizure, also known as the generalized tonic-clonic type, is the 
most severe and involves massive body convulsions, loss of consciousness, and 
sometimes loss of bladder or bowel control. When consciousness returns, the 
person can feel confused and sleepy, and will not have any memory of the 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Convulsive 
</P>
<P>
Not all seizures are convulsive, but in all cases, what you should not do is as 
important as what you should do. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not put anything in the child's mouth and do not try to hold the tongue; 
it is physically impossible for the child to swallow it. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not try to give liquids or medicines during or just after the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
* Very important: Do not restrain the child's movements. Rather, guide the 
child away from hard, sharp or hot objects. Put something soft under his or her 
head. Turn the child on one side to keep airway clear. 
</P>
<P>
In a Petit Mal seizure, a blank stare comes over the child's face for a few 
seconds. It may be accompanied by rapid blinking, upward rolling of the eyes, 
chewing movements. The child may drop what he or she was holding and be out of 
touch, unresponsive, although the child appears to respond to his or her name. 
</P>
<P>
Partial seizures can include involuntary jerking of fingers or toes, sometimes 
spreading up the body. Other types may cause the child to suddenly collapse or 
fall. In children between 3 months and 3 years of age, seizures may be 
characterized by sudden jerking movements, with the head dropping or the body 
pulling into a kind of fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
In all cases, observe the child carefully, making sure he or she cannot be hurt 
by surroundings. And it is important always to speak calmly and reassuringly. 
Comfort the child afterwards. If the child has not been diagnosed with 
epilepsy, medical evaluation is necessary.

MOROCCO PINS ITS HOPE FOR FUTURE ON SPAN TO SPAIN

<P>
Muslim Morocco and Roman Catholic Spain are to build a bridge to link Europe 
and Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar, the Atlantic gateway to the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will be built before 2000," Morocco's King Hassan II said in a 
recent interview with the Spanish newspaper ABC. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no estimate of the cost of the project or when work was expected to 
start on the link across the busy waterway, about 10 miles wide at its 
narrowest point and 250 to 900 yards deep. 
</P>
<P>
In Morocco the project is considered as significant as the building of the Suez 
Canal more than 100 years ago to connect the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a bridge . . . which has been agreed by all," said Hassan, who has 
previously described Morocco as Europe's "back yard'. 
</P>
<P>
Experts three years ago estimated that the bridging of the strait, first 
approved by Spain's King Juan Carlos I and King Hassan in 1979, would cost at 
least $2 billion, but costs have risen sharply since. 
</P>
<P>
Spain and Morocco are being driven by political and economic forces to forge 
closer links. 
</P>
<P>
"We should seriously consider the benefits of joining the continents of Europe 
and Africa," Hassan said. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge would strengthen Morocco's economic bonds with Spain and the other 
11 members of the European Community. Rabat is keen to join the EC, but last 
year its application was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
It would also make Morocco an important axis of an overland transport system 
for trade and tourism between European, Arab and African countries, Moroccan 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is expected to cross the strait from Capa Malabata, east of Tangier, 
in Morocco, to Punta Paloma, about 6 miles west of the Spanish town of Tarifa. 
</P>
<P>
Europe imports many raw materials from Africa and in return exports capital and 
consumer goods to the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Morocco's imports come from the EC and 40% of its exports are sold to 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
A joint Moroccan-Spanish committee agreed at a meeting in Rabat last October to 
convene a conference of European and African business and transport leaders in 
Morocco in 1990 to promote the scheme and win financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
"The project has assumed a serious image for the international scientific 
community, which we hope would be reinforced by the conference," the leader of 
the Spanish delegation, Manuel Pandadaro, told the meeting.

PEARY'S CLAIMS IN DOUBT; 
</P>
<P>
RALPH PLAISTED IS NO LEGEND, BUT DATA SHOWS HE WAS 1ST TO NORTH POLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When a researcher interpreting long-closed documents concluded recently that 
the legendary Robert E. Peary was not the first explorer to cross the shifting 
Arctic ice to the North Pole, it came as no surprise to Ralph Plaisted. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Peary didn't do it. All the members of our expedition knew it," said 
Plaisted, who led a group of nine do-it-yourself snowmobile explorers to the 
pole in April, 1968, in the first "indisputable" conquest by surface. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Plaisted was an asterisk in the record books behind Peary until last 
fall, when original navigational records, uncovered from Peary's 1909 dog-sled 
voyage, indicated that the renowned explorer probably never got closer than 121 
miles from the pole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peary Claim Certified 
</P>
<P>
Though Peary's record has been in doubt from the day he returned, a Senate 
committee and the influential National Geographic Society, which co-sponsored 
the Peary expedition, certified his claim in 1911. Peary was promoted to rear 
admiral in the Navy and retired on a comfortable pension. 
</P>
<P>
"He became wealthy from books and lecture fees, but I didn't," said Plaisted, 
now 61, sitting in a study adorned with clothing, photographs and memorabilia 
from his expedition in the large mobile home he shares with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Plaisted said his own difficulties in the Arctic, including a failed expedition 
in 1967, convinced him that Peary's claim was only wishful. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he went to the North Pole in 37 days and came back over the same trail 
in 16, and we knew that couldn't happen because the roads we built were gone in 
a few hours," said Plaisted. "Up there, there're 5 1/2 million square miles of 
ocean, and it's moving constantly." 
</P>
<P>
His own expedition took "43 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inner Contentment 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, Plaisted and his crew, which included a schoolteacher, a lawyer, 
a doctor and a movie cameraman, had to content themselves with knowing inside 
that they were first. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Plaisted ran his own insurance agency until 1971, when he and his 
family built a log cabin near a remote lake in Saskatchewan and lived for a 
year on moose and caribou meat, fish and canned food. He and his wife now run a 
small fishing camp at the site for spring and summer vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had started 20 years ago and tried to promote myself and say, 'I know 
Peary didn't do it, and I know I did, and I should be in the history books 
instead of Peary,' they would have said: 'It's just sour grapes. He doesn't 
have any proof,' " Plaisted said. 
</P>
<P>
Proof that Peary never reached the pole came when Baltimore astronomer Dennis 
Rawlins unearthed and analyzed Peary's navigational observations from the day 
he claimed to have been at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calculations Don't Jibe 
</P>
<P>
The notes, sealed for 50 years, didn't jibe with real observations, according 
to Rawlins. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun is virtually steady at the North Pole, whereas here we have it rising 
rapidly," he said. "The position I've calculated from the data is 88 degrees 
and 15 minutes latitude, 14 degrees longitude, if his clock was correct. 
</P>
<P>
"It means he was 105 nautical miles (or 121 statute miles) from the pole." 
</P>
<P>
Even National Geographic, a champion of the Peary legacy for nearly 80 years, 
has published an article indicating that Peary faked his greatest achievement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disputed Diary 
</P>
<P>
Wally Herbert, a British polar explorer, wrote in the magazine's September 
issue that Peary apparently inserted after his return the page in his diary 
where he celebrated reaching "The Pole at last." 
</P>
<P>
Though evidence suggests Peary perpetrated a hoax, Plaisted, Rawlins and 
Herbert all say he was a great navigator with a noble goal and shouldn't be 
judged too harshly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's 53 years old, his feet are frozen and he knows he's never going to do it 
again, and he's 121 miles from the North Pole," said Plaisted, referring to 
Peary's loss of eight toes in six expeditions. "With his supplies, he knew, 'I 
can get there, but I can't get back.' 
</P>
<P>
"I know he didn't want to lie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Eager to Go Back 
</P>
<P>
Because of the dangers, Plaisted said he "wouldn't go back there if you put a 
million dollars on my desk right now." 
</P>
<P>
His group spent months in northern Minnesota training on snowmobiles, which had 
just been invented. They wore $1,000 synthetic outfits based on Eskimo designs 
and signed up 89 financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
When the expedition reached the pole -- "one mass of jumbled ice not any 
different from anywhere else up there" -- Plaisted's group spent the night 
waiting for a U.S. Air Force plane to fly over and document their achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"The next morning at 10 o'clock we had to move our tents some 2 1/2 miles so we 
could be in the same position as the night before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Indisputable Attainment' 
</P>
<P>
Three types of Air Force navigational instruments confirmed the 90 degrees 
North position, and the Plaisted Expedition became known in the Guinness Book 
of World Records as "the earliest indisputable attainment of the North Pole 
over sea ice." 
</P>
<P>
The discrediting of Peary's claim means that Plaisted will take his place 
beside such polar record holders as Roald Amundsen of Norway, who in 1911 was 
the first person to reach the South Pole and in 1926 reached the North Pole by 
airboat, and Joseph Fletcher, the first person to stand at the North Pole after 
flying there in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been called and told they're going to change the history books," Plaisted 
said, laughing. "I said that and 50 cents will get me a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcomes Recognition 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that the recognition is better late than never. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can write the book I want to write" about the expedition, he said. "To 
write it before, it would just be sour grapes to the National Geographic, and 
they'd shoot me down. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be very grateful that people created this hoax long enough for me to 
be born, grow up and raise enough money to make the expedition," Plaisted said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had said Peary didn't do it, then there would have been someone who 
would have before me."

OZONE LOSS OVER ARCTIC BEING EXPLORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GERBER, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
STAVANGER, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American and European scientists using a modern version of the U-2 spy plane 
are setting out to explore troubling signs of ozone loss high over the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
The project, organized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
runs from Jan. 1 to mid-February, the period when a hole apparently opens up in 
the protective ozone layer at the top of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the scientists are veterans of a 1987 expedition that documented an 
ozone hole over Antarctica during the southern winter. 
</P>
<P>
"The ozone hole over Antarctica is something you can't miss," said Dr. Adrian 
Tuck, a chemist and meteorologist. "We did come up with an unequivocal answer 
that the ozone hole was indeed caused by man-made chemicals, and a natural 
question to ask is: 'Is it possible in the Arctic?' " 
</P>
<P>
Scientists fear that the loss of ozone, a gas which filters the sun's harmful 
ultraviolet rays, is leading to increased skin cancer and eye damage and could 
upset the food chain by harming many species of plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, a U.S. dermatologist, recently reported a 1,500% increase 
in melanoma, a form of skin cancer, in the United States since 1935, with more 
people contracting the disease at a younger age. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck and other scientists gathering at Sola, a Norwegian air force base here, 
said that the Arctic hole appears to be smaller than the southern one but that 
it could be more serious because it is closer to where people live. 
</P>
<P>
"If the changes occur, they could probably have an effect over a much larger 
area, due to the difference in meteorology," said Ivar Isaksen, a professor at 
the University of Oslo. "There's a much larger exchange of air. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea here is to look at what happens not only in the vortex, but what 
consequences it could have for the ozone at lower latitudes." 
</P>
<P>
The vortex is a circulation of strong westerly winds in the polar region. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists will analyze clouds about 12 miles up that "in a manner that was 
completely unpredicted . . . can intervene in the chemistry, change the 
chemical balance, and make it easier for the chlorine from refrigerants and 
aerosol can sprays and so on to destroy the ozone," said Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
Four pilots will take turns flying through the clouds in a single-engine ER-2, 
an updated model U-2, loaded with scientific instruments. A modified DC-8 
airliner will look at the clouds from below with lasers and other instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The missions will mostly be north and west of Norway, but will avoid Soviet air 
space, said pilot Jim Barrileaux of Dublin, Calif. He said the Soviets might be 
sending up research flights of their own over northern Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian air force cleared out a sprawling hangar at its seaside base to 
make room for the ER-2. An advance team nailed together Sheetrock partitions as 
temporary offices, and computer experts patched together a network for data 
analysis and weather reports beamed down by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
It could take as long as a year to analyze the data and publish a full report, 
Estelle Condon, the project manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
Worry about ozone depletion led last year to industrial nations' signing a 
treaty to reduce the use of the chlorofluorocarbon chemicals that are primary 
suspects in ozone destruction. Further steps are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"We have information from the southern hemisphere, and so we would like 
information from the northern hemisphere, so when the negotiations take place 
they have the best information possible to make the decisions," said Condon. 
</P>
<P>
The project's $10 million budget is "not very big by NASA standards," she said. 
Up to 150 scientists will take part, most of them from the United States. 
Britain, Norway and West Germany also are represented. 
</P>
<P>
The mission's success will depend largely on the weather, said Tuck. The clouds 
could drift over the Soviet Union, or they may not form at all, though 1985 was 
the only year in the last decade when that happened.

RECITERS OF KORAN EVOKE TEARS, ECSTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So strong is the emotion whipped up by a good Koran-reciter that Muslims may 
weep or faint on hearing him intone verses of their holy book. 
</P>
<P>
Some reciters win a following like that of pop or movie stars. Their tapes, 
which sell by the thousands in Muslim countries, have played a part in the 
spread of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Reciters, who memorize the Koran in their youth, deliver verses before Friday 
prayers in mosques and on radio and television. The best inspire ecstasy in 
listeners who are moved by both the words and the music of their performance. 
</P>
<P>
"To Muslims, these verses are the holy words of God. They mysteriously feel his 
presence in every single letter," said Abdullah Schleifer, an American Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptians dominate the art, and the death last month of Abdel-Basset 
Abdel-Sammad deprived Muslims around the world of one of its most popular 
modern exponents. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Sheik Brando" because he rose to stardom at the same time as film 
actor Marlon Brando, Abdel-Sammad was the only foreigner allowed by Saudi 
Arabia to recite the Koran at the holy shrines of Mecca and Medina. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of Koranic recitation in Arabic, in which the Prophet Mohammed 
handed down the holy book more than 14 centuries ago, transcends borders 
because Muslims who don't read the language can study it transliterated. 
</P>
<P>
They must recite Koranic verses in Arabic while performing prayers five times a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the miracles of the Koran, that even if you don't speak Arabic 
you feel great consolation in hearing the verses," Schleifer, who teaches 
journalism at the American University in Cairo, said. 
</P>
<P>
Koranic recitation has helped spread Islam, according to Ahmed Shaaban, a 
teacher at one of 15 recitation schools set up by the 1,000-year-old Al Azhar 
University in Cairo, the world's oldest center of Islamic studies. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of Islam, preachers traveled from country to country by camel 
to teach the religion. Now things are easier -- they record their verses on 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
Shaaban said the Prophet encouraged gifted exponents like Abdullah ibn Massoud 
and Obai ibn Kaab in his native Arabia to recite the Koran. He told followers, 
"Take the Koran from Ibn Massoud or Ibn Kaab." 
</P>
<P>
The art was passed from generation to generation by other reciters in Iraq and 
Syria until Egypt became the center of recitation more than 800 years ago, 
Shaaban said. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptians were the first to teach the art in institutes, he said. Today, 
students from China, Pakistan, Malaysia and African countries are enrolled at 
the Al Azhar schools. 
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Sammad was one of a long line of revered Egyptian reciters. 
</P>
<P>
A chief reciter in Kuwait, Ahmed Taraboulsi, says nobody can match Egyptian 
reciters. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is the cradle of Koranic recitation. We have all learned it at the hands 
of the Egyptians who play an important role in teaching Islam and the Koran," 
Taraboulsi said. 
</P>
<P>
Since early this century, the government has sent about 300 reciters to 
America, Europe, Asia and Africa as well as the Arab world every year during 
the fasting month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Neayna, who combines recitation with working as a pediatrician, is one of 
today's rising stars. 
</P>
<P>
With a hand cupped over his ear, he recites Koranic verses before functions 
attended by President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
Neayna says recitations he has given in London and Munich converted several 
Britons and West Germans to Islam. He recalls with awe the response of a big 
audience in New Delhi last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget the tears of the Indians, and their thunderous rejoicing, 
uttering the word 'Allah' during my recitation," he said. "It's a feeling I 
have never experienced before." 
</P>
<P>
Neayna said he started reciting in childhood but took it up professionally 
after the late President Anwar Sadat heard him in 1978 during an official 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
He intends to keep both his professions. 
</P>
<P>
"Koran heals the soul, and as a doctor I help heal the body," he said.

ELEPHANT'S UNDERWATER COUSIN TO BE PROTECTED; 
</P>
<P>
IVORY COAST PLANS RESERVE FOR MANATEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans are under way to create the first reserve in Africa for the manatee, the 
1-ton, 10-foot-long underwater cousin of the elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The manatees live in lagoons, rivers and coastal areas from Senegal to Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve, on an inlet of the Bandama River near Abidjan, could be 
established as soon as March, according to Gbande Die, director of the adjacent 
Azagny National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first protected zone for manatees in Africa," Die said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely how many manatees, also known as sea cows, there are in 
Abidjan, whose oceanfront lagoons make ideal habitats, but officials say the 
population is dwindling and estimate their numbers in the hundreds rather than 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ask the peasants, they tell us they used to see lots of manatees and 
now they don't," Die said. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve will allow scientists to study manatees, which are found in 
Florida, the West Indies, the Amazon basin and West Africa, and whose behavior 
is little known. 
</P>
<P>
The experts will also determine how best to protect the animals, which are 
hunted for their beef-like flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Manatees are mammals and had a common ancestor with the elephant 75 million 
years ago. They have been a protected species since this former French colony 
became independent in 1960, but that has not stopped fishermen from poaching 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to enforce because the law is just a piece of paper," Die said. "And 
it's not just manatees, it's virtually all wild animals in Ivory Coast that 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the impetus for creating the reserve and protecting manatees arises 
from work here by James Powell, 34, an American naturalist from Wildlife 
Conservation International, an arm of the New York Zoological Society. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be as concerned about the manatees as we are about the rhinoceros," 
Powell said recently. "Manatees are big, impressive and unique. There is 
nothing else like them." 
</P>
<P>
He said that manatees, whose night-time squeals are believed to have sparked 
mermaid myths and who are associated in West Africa with a spirit called "Mamie 
Wata," are timid and gentle. 
</P>
<P>
The West African manatee, which has a wide muzzle and a long, bulbous trunk 
with two side flippers, looks a bit like a toothless walrus or a sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely strong but they don't seem to have an aggressive bone in 
their bodies," said Powell, who has trapped 18 manatees to fit them with radio 
transmitters so he can track their movements. He was able to work with them 
without tranquilizing them. 
</P>
<P>
He said that visitors have flocked to see a baby manatee he raised in a pen 
near a popular beach resort, but the animal died several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He doubted that the dark-gray manatees, which are almost impossible to see in 
the murky lagoons, could become a tourist attraction, as they have in Florida. 
But Powell thinks man and manatee could learn to live side by side. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an important role in the estuarine environment," he said. "They are 
the only large herbivores, so they eat off the unwanted vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that if hunting were regulated manatees could provide an important 
source of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and officials of Ivory Coast's Ministry of Water and Forests said the 
key to saving the manatee is learning more about them and educating fishermen 
about the perils of poaching. 
</P>
<P>
Kouadio Akoi, an Education Ministry officer who works with Powell, said that it 
is hard to persuade people to give up a source of food but that it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The fishermen tell us, 'First you say don't kill the tortoise, then you say 
don't kill the manatee -- what are we going to eat?' "But the disappearance of 
an animal would be a loss to everybody. We have a heritage we have to leave to 
our children."

PIONEER IN NATURAL FOODS; 
</P>
<P>
ORGANIC FARM FOUNDER HAD 50-YEAR HEAD START

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seed of an idea was planted in 1939, when Paul Keene, a young missionary to 
India, met Mohandas Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
Out of it grew Walnut Acres, one of the first organic farms in the the United 
States. An oasis of natural foods in a fast-food world, it has blossomed into a 
$5-million-a-year business since Keene and his wife, Betty, came to central 
Pennsylvania in 1946 and began raising produce without pesticides or other 
man-made chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The 108-acre operation has been expanded to nearly five times its original 
size, and now yields about 300 products that are sold worldwide. The most 
popular ones include preservative-free peanut butter, granolas and other 
unsweetened cereals and freshly ground, whole-grain flours. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy at Walnut Acres, according to Keene, is that "food should be -- 
is -- the most important thing in life, and one should be more concerned about 
what one eats than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Health 
</P>
<P>
"All joys and all outreach can only be appreciated if you're healthy and don't 
have to worry about your insides and your outsides," added Keene, who is 78. 
</P>
<P>
George DeVault, editor and publisher of The New Farm magazine published by the 
Regenerative Agriculture Assn., said that Walnut Acres is considered a pioneer 
in organic foods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the very near future, that's going to be the conventional way 
of farming," DeVault said. "The chemical-intensive system we have now is not 
sustainable -- the economics, the environment, the health concerns, the 
residue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People like Paul Keene have helped pave the way for a healthier future for all 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
Keene's desire to enrich the lives of others was encouraged by Gandhi, whom he 
met nearly 50 years ago in British-ruled India. Keene, the Yale-educated son of 
a minister, had just completed his first year as a missionary there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consulted With Gandhi 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him: 'I'm teaching mathematics in a school in America. I'm here and 
I'm learning a lot about India, and I'm not satisfied with this work I'm doing. 
What would you suggest?' 
</P>
<P>
"He said: 'Well, I can't advise you on the details, but the first thing you 
should do when you get back is give away everything you have.' " 
</P>
<P>
An inspired Keene returned to the United States in 1940 with his wife, a 
British missionary's daughter. He taught one more year at New Jersey's Drew 
University before quitting. 
</P>
<P>
The couple spent the next several years studying organic farming at schools 
that stressed the need to "go back to the soil." In 1946, they borrowed $5,000 
to buy the Penns Creek farm 55 miles north of Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
They worked the land without electricity, tractors or insurance. They refrained 
from spraying their crops or the soil. Within a few years, Walnut Acres, the 
business, was born. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profit-Sharing Structure 
</P>
<P>
"We immediately said: 'Well, it's not right that we own this whole business and 
get all the profits.' So we gave the business away." 
</P>
<P>
The private, employee-owned business now encompasses 500 acres free of 
synthetic chemicals and tilled by modern methods, and a full-time staff of 95. 
Mail-order business has grown 17% in the past year alone, according to Bob 
Anderson, 43, Keene's son-in-law and the company's vice president and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
As business flourishes, so does Walnut Acres' philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
About $7,000 to $8,000 in donations from customers and employees will be 
funneled this year into a community center for tiny Penns Creek, built and run 
by Walnut Acres Foundation Inc., a nonprofit offshoot. 
</P>
<P>
Another $8,000 will go to a home and school for orphans and unwanted children 
in India, a cause adopted by the foundation 12 years ago. Last year, $33,500 
was raised to add a building to the school in memory of Betty Keene, who died 
in May, 1987, at 74. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature Essays Published 
</P>
<P>
In his "Greetings from the Farm" essays in the bimonthly Walnut Acres 
catalogue, the lean and energetic founder writes of farming, nature "and the 
oneness of all life." The Globe Pequot Press recently released a collection of 
59 of them, written over the past 30 years, in a book entitled "Fear Not To Sow 
Because of the Birds." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see the birds that are going to steal your grain from you," Keene 
says. "They need food, too." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said people are becoming more interested in diet and nutrition, in 
part because of Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's warnings about obesity, 
cholesterol and the perils of tobacco use. "Going together with this has been a 
little bit more interest in gourmet foods, and gourmet cooks start looking for 
purer ingredients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're leaders in the field in letting people understand what healthful eating 
is and what it means," said his wife, Ruth Keene Anderson, 43, who is secretary 
and treasurer of Walnut Acres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Organic' Rules Vary 
</P>
<P>
Although exact figures are not available, experts say that organic food 
operations make up between 1% and 5% of the nation's farms. The definition of 
organic varies from state to state, however, and the confusion has prompted 
some to call for federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1980 defined organic farming as a 
production system that avoids or largely excludes use of synthetic fertilizers, 
pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives. Organic farmer rely 
on crop rotation, crop residues, animal manures and mechanical cultivation of 
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for greater uniformity," Patrick Madden, professor of 
agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University, said. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables, grains and other crops native to Pennsylvania are grown at Walnut 
Acres. Rice, nuts, dried fruits and other ingredients are supplied by other 
organic farms that meet Walnut Acres' standards.

A district court has ordered a suspect in the killing of Swedish Prime Minister 
Olof Palme kept in detention for another two weeks pending further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Stockholm court last week approved the prosecutors' demand that Christer 
Pettersson, 41, be held until Jan. 27 awaiting formal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson was arrested on Dec. 14 and arraigned two days later, raising hopes 
for an end to a murder hunt that lasted almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Palme, a four-term prime minister, was fatally shot on Feb. 28, 1986, while 
walking home from a movie with his wife in central Stockholm.

modern conglomerate, died Thursday at his winter home in the Bahamas at the age 
of 92. 
</P>
<P>
Little broke new ground in the 1950s when Textron, which he had founded as a 
textile firm called Special Yarns Corp. in 1923, absorbed more than 40 smaller 
companies turning out unrelated products ranging from radar antennas to 
snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
This diversification program boosted Textron's sales from $99 million in 1952 
to $383 million in 1960 and earned him fame as "the man who started the whole 
conglomerate movement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Private School 
</P>
<P>
Born in Wakefield, Mass., on March 1, 1896, Little was put through Noble and 
Greenough, a prestigious Boston private school, by his wealthy uncle, Arthur D. 
Little, the well-known management consultant. The young man graduated from 
Harvard College in 1919 after service as an infantry lieutenant in France 
during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The firm he founded in 1923 did reasonably well for about 15 years, but by 1952 
was losing money and Little was concerned at the poor rate of return it was 
earning on its substantial capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing to diversify, Little said, he was attempting to "eliminate the 
effect of business cycles on the parent company by having many divisions in 
unrelated fields." 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, the company had 29,000 employees working in 90 plants and was ranked 
124th on the Fortune 500 list of the nation's largest industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Little said simply that his program "had worked." 
</P>
<P>
By then, his personal fortune was estimated at more than $20 million, but he 
still listed his annual savings as nil and was known to borrow train fare from 
friends for the trip from his home in Narragansett, R.I., to Textron's home 
offices in Providence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retired in 1960 
</P>
<P>
He retired as Textron's board chairman and chief executive in 1960 and devoted 
much of his energy over the next few years to building the Narragansett Capital 
Corp., the nation's largest publicly held investment company specializing in 
small businesses. He also served as board chairman of Amtel Inc., Bevis 
Industries and the American Television and Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he wrote a candid, tongue-in-cheek tribute to America's 
free-enterprise system called "How to Lose $100 Million and Other Valuable 
Advice." The book served as a "how not to" primer on entrepreneurship, sort of 
a corporate version of Aesop's Fables, complete with a "moral to the story" at 
the end of each venture described. 
</P>
<P>
He was married to Augusta Ellis in 1932. They were divorced in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Little is survived by a son, Arthur, of Boston; a daughter, Augusta Bishop of 
Vashon Island, Wash., and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
At his wish, there will be no funeral services. "No funeral," he wrote in his 
memoirs. "Hope my friends will just think I've taken a long trip."

JUDGE JOHN H. HEWS; DENIED DEATH PLEA OF ELIZABETH BOUVIA IN 1983 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Hayden Hews, the state appellate court judge who denied quadriplegic 
Elizabeth Bouvia's writ to let her die, died Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hews, 60, was taken from his Riverside home to Riverside Community Hospital 
where he was pronounced dead at 9:24 p.m. of an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hews, who served 19 years in state judgeships, was appointed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian to the appeals court in San Bernardino in August, 1986. Before that, 
he served in the Riverside Superior Court for 16 years, including three years 
as presiding judge. He was appointed to the Superior Court in 1970 by fellow 
Republican and then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death he was an associate justice in Division 2 of the 4th 
District Court of Appeal, where he authored more than 150 appellate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
While on the Superior Court bench, one of his cases was that of Bouvia, who had 
asked the court to order hospital officials to let her starve herself. Hews 
denied her petition in December, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Hews, a lifelong Riverside resident, attended Stanford University and after 
serving in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War, received a law degree 
from UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Virginia, and four daughters.

Valentin Glushko, a key and secretive figure in the development of many Soviet 
space ventures, has died at age 80, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The official obituary printed by the newspaper Friday said Glushko died Tuesday 
after a serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
Glushko was described as a close colleague of the late Sergei Korolyov, the 
founder of the Soviet space program. In the 1930s he helped develop liquid fuel 
engines, now in use on all Soviet rockets. 
</P>
<P>
The obituary, which provided only sketchy details of his life, said he played a 
leading role in the development of several programs, including orbital space 
stations, the reusable space shuttle Buran, launched for the first time last 
November, and Energia, the world's most powerful booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
Glushko was born in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, completed his studies in 
Leningrad and then worked in a series of institutes before taking over in 1974 
the space working group founded by Korolyov. 
</P>
<P>
The obituary said he constantly sought new solutions to problems and displayed 
"creative courage" and great organizational capabilities. He received a series 
of Soviet awards, including the Hero of Socialist Labor twice.

National television, apparently inspired by the U.S. presidential campaign, 
suggested Saturday that the two front-runners for the country's vacant post of 
prime minister take part in a televised public debate. 
</P>
<P>
Ante Markovic, a member of the collective presidency in the republic of 
Croatia, and Borisav Jovic, Parliament president in Serbia, should appear 
together in a live broadcast, a Yugoslav television commentator said on the 
evening news program. 
</P>
<P>
They would each have a limited time to describe their economic and political 
views and would then answer telephone questions from viewers and make any 
further comments on their records, the commentator suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Branko Mikulic resigned Dec. 30. Yugoslavia is in the midst of a 
political and economic crisis with inflation of over 250%, a foreign debt of 
$22 billion and growing ethnic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The country's state presidency on Thursday named six candidates to replace 
Mikulic, but political analysts described Markovic and Jovic as the 
front-runners.

U.S. COPTERS RESCUE 32 ON SHIP IN ATLANTIC

Two U.S. Air Force helicopters that had to be refueled in flight hoisted all 32 
people aboard a damaged Cypriot freighter to safety Saturday during a daring 
rescue in the stormy North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most dangerous mission I've ever been on," said U.S. Air Force Capt. 
David Freeman of Sacramento, Calif. "But everything went well." 
</P>
<P>
The helicopters flew the West German captain, identified only as Pietersen, his 
wife, the West German engineer, and the 29-member Filipino crew to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The West German-owned ship, the 42,000-ton Yarrowanga, was bound from Norway to 
the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada to take on iron ore when it was caught in a 
gale Friday that put two large gashes in the hull. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's engine failed, but the crew restarted it and the ship was moving 
under its own power toward Ireland when the rescuers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Yarrowanga was listing in 30-foot seas and 50-m.p.h. winds when one of the 
helicopters first tried unsuccessfully to land on the deck, rescue organizers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range HH-53C helicopters, based in Woodbridge-Bentwaters in eastern 
England, had flown to Shannon International Airport in Ireland Friday night and 
took off early Saturday for the flight of more than 200 miles to the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
They were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Hercules tanker aircraft 
and reached the Yarrowanga in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The first helicopter lifted up 15 people with a winch and the second aircraft 
hauled up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a textbook rescue operation," said Maj. Ken Stafford, leader of the 
U.S. rescue squad. "Everything went according to plan. All taken off the 
stricken ship are in good health, and none of them will need to be 
hospitalized."

PLO'S DRIVE TO ESTABLISH A STATE HAS BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ISRAELI PSYCHE

<P>
Munir Fasheh, a Palestinian sociologist who lives in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank, recalls how he tried twice over a 10-year period to visit his family home 
in Jerusalem, abandoned during the early years of the Arab-Israeli conflict 
after war sent many Palestinians into exile. 
</P>
<P>
Each time, the Israeli woman living in the house greeted him with fear, a broom 
and a refusal to let him tour the premises. "She became nearly hysterical. She 
thought I had come to take it back. No matter what I said, she would not let me 
in," Fasheh said. 
</P>
<P>
"My presence set off a whole string of emotions. I reminded her that this is 
perhaps not her home after all. I felt she just wanted me to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal and Political 
</P>
<P>
This personal scene, one encountered by a number of Palestinians who seek to 
view the land they left behind decades ago, is also being played out on the 
political level as Israel resists calls to talk with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization about possible solutions to the Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In the diplomatic case, the problem is not only that the potential visitor -- 
the PLO -- has proved willing to kill to try to get some or all of the land 
between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
More profoundly, it is also a question of the content and implication of the 
PLO's message: the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel and the 
effect such an event would have on the Israeli psyche. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Philosophy Challenged 
</P>
<P>
Although public discussion in Israel of the Palestinian quest for a homeland 
usually centers on the country's fears for its security, the issue also is 
viewed as undermining the philosophical basis for the Israeli state and the 
sense of its citizens that they belong in the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in an interview Friday with the Jerusalem Post, 
declared flatly that a Palestinian state "negates our existence as a state." 
</P>
<P>
Commentators say they see a reflection of deeply rooted fears in Shamir's 
words. 
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are touching the existential threat to our being at home, as 
if we Israelis were some evil wind that blew in here and took over," said 
Jewish philosopher David Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Diminish Moral Right 
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli diplomat Shaul Ramati added: "When Zionists came here, we were 
sure that we had the moral right to come and live here. To recognize the 
Palestinian state would diminish that moral right. It would suggest we took 
something from someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The complex web of resistance to the PLO and to Palestinian national rights is 
bound up with the troubled history of Israel as well as the long history of the 
Jews and their persecution at the hands of non-Jewish communities worldwide, 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman notes out that the PLO's standard anti-Israeli campaign focused on 
pushing Israel into the sea, reviving memories of other persecutions in other 
places. PLO chief Yasser Arafat's recent renunciation of terrorism cannot erase 
an Israeli suspicion that Arafat himself, and Palestinians in general, think 
Israel should disappear, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Touches a Deep Fear' 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional Palestinian delegitimization of Jews touches a deep fear. They 
say we do not belong here and thus tamper with the most transformative event in 
Jewish history -- the creation of Israel," Hartman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientist Shlomo Avineri added: "Here is an organization (the PLO) 
that for 20 years has said that Israel is a fascist, racist state, the product 
of imperialism, and has no legitimate right to be here. That idea may be 
changing, but one must recognize that it will take time for Israelis to change 
also." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent newspaper article, historian Shaul Friedlander took the view that 
the rejection of Palestinian nationalism and the PLO originates in scars from 
the Holocaust. "Inside society, there are fears concerning Palestinian matters 
wrapped up in other things. . . . These fears are connected to the Holocaust," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Friedlander argued that Israelis are faced with the possibility that the Arabs 
have some measure of right on their side and thus will never give up in their 
quest to eliminate Israel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Based on a Just Claim' 
</P>
<P>
"The fear today still derives from the feeling that the Arab striving for 
revenge is so total exactly because it is based on a just claim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The very proximity and visibility of the Arabs, Friedlander added, challenge 
the idea, widely held at the beginning of the mass Zionist movement into 
Palestine, that the area was "a land without people for a people without land." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, after a while, it was discovered that there is a people living here and 
their living here is a very live reality," he wrote. "The wish was precisely 
that the problem will disappear somehow, that the land will be emptied of this 
disturbing people." 
</P>
<P>
Other observers say they think that fear is less an obstacle to meeting with 
the PLO than the Israeli's view of himself as a victim of history, coupled with 
an unwillingness to consider that another victim of history lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scenario Rewritten 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the 13-month-old Arab uprising, with its daily image of underdog 
Palestinian stone throwers up against armed Israeli soldiers, is upstaging a 
previous scenario that featured underdog Israel up against the Arab world and 
PLO terror. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we were the victims of the world. When the PLO espoused and practiced 
terror, it fit into our world view: We were still the victimized," said Yaron 
Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University. "By talking to the PLO, we 
would be suggesting that we are victimizers as well." 
</P>
<P>
Ezrahi and other political experts view Israel's efforts to counter the PLO's 
diplomatic moves by emphasizing the terrorist threat as a means of painting 
Palestinians as the aggressor and Israel the perpetual victim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Are Victims 
</P>
<P>
But Ezrahi notes out that the Palestinians share with Jews similar feelings of 
being eternally aggrieved. "Both, in essence, are victims, and it seems hard to 
get victim to talk with victim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, should the PLO prove to have truly abandoned terrorism -- a 
still-unsettled question -- Israel could find itself without the means of 
resisting peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
"The more moderate the PLO appears, the worse it is for the Israeli 
government," Ezrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
Fasheh, the Palestinian sociologist, noted that the United States' decision 
last month to open talks with the PLO helped reduce the feeling among 
Palestinians that they are unfairly judged in the Middle East conflict and that 
this has helped put Palestinians in a negotiating mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians were sitting in refugee camps away from their homes and yet were 
called the criminal," Fasheh said. "The United States' action lifted that onus. 
It is not completely lifted, but it was a start." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can't Ignore Them' 
</P>
<P>
Jewish philosopher Hartman said he thinks Washington's decision forced Israel 
to open its eyes and gaze on its neighbors: "Washington is the dispenser of 
grace. The Palestinians have taken on the mask of reality. They exist. We can't 
ignore them." 
</P>
<P>
With stiff resistance to both the PLO and a Palestinian state, it is not clear 
what ideas Israel would bring to peace talks. So far, the Israeli government 
seems willing to give in on certain questions about the form of the talks, but 
not their substance. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jerusalem Post interview, Shamir hinted that he would accept an 
international conference as a backdrop for peace talks. This had long been a 
proposal made by his chief political rival, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, but 
generally rejected by Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations or Washington and Moscow together could moderate the talks, 
as long as "the external bodies do not intervene in the content of the 
negotiations," Shamir said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows how far we are willing to go, even to take certain risks," he 
added. "I stress that this is not a risk, because it cannot affect the 
substance."

British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave urged Israel on Saturday to 
recall the guerrilla past of many of its founding fathers and accept that 
Palestinian militants could also abandon violence. 
</P>
<P>
Waldegrave told British Broadcasting Corp. radio a day after talks in Tunisia 
with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat that Israel should 
adapt to the PLO's proclaimed moves towards peace. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is changing around them, and if they do not change they will be left 
behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the point I would like to make to the Israeli government is that, just 
as many of the founding fathers of Israel -- including indeed the present prime 
minister of Israel -- were in their time involved in what we at the time 
described as terrorism, but . . . (took) the move away from the gun and toward 
the institutions of peace, so they should have confidence that there are people 
on the Palestinian side who can take the same courageous step," he said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, have rejected 
Arafat's recognition of Israel and rejection of "all forms of terrorism" as a 
deception aimed at destroying the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
But London welcomed the move, which opened the way to Friday's first-ever talks 
between Arafat and a British minister. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir was born in Poland but moved to Palestine where he became leader of a 
small militant guerrilla group known as the Stern Gang, which was dedicated to 
fighting British rule and establishing a Jewish state.

Fidel Castro's sharp rejection of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program

(reform) measures, but we don't think it is appropriate to force them," said 
one of three Cuba-based Soviets who agreed to a rare private interview on 
condition that their words be "taken in the context of Cuban, Soviet and 
American friendship" and that they remain unidentified. "We have to have 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet economic aid to Cuba, now running at a rate of about $5 billion a year, 
will continue as it has, they said. But they cautioned that there is growing 
impatience with Cuba's inefficient waste of the money under its rigidly 
ideological, centrally planned system. They implied that at least some 
improvements are urgent, not only because the Soviets can ill-afford to waste 
aid money at a time when resources are scarce at home, but because the Soviet 
enterprises upon which Cuba depends to buy its goods are now becoming 
autonomous and competitive and Havana will face a tougher task in dealing with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Things Will Change 
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the efficiency of Cuban industry and agriculture," 
said one. "We are helping Cuba. We will continue to help. But we now have to 
search for more effective forms of our economic help. The nature of it won't 
change, but some methods of our relations will have to change." 
</P>
<P>
Castro has become increasingly critical of Gorbachev's program of perestroika, 
or restructuring, in speeches during the past six months, dismissing them last 
July as "methods that reek of capitalism." In December, he criticized Moscow by 
warning of "difficulties that may come from the camp of our own friends." On 
Jan. 1, he provocatively contrasted his self-proclaimed ideological purity with 
Gorbachev's new openness by proclaiming "Marxism-Leninism or death." 
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here have seen Castro's caustic criticisms as portents of a 
major split between the two countries whose special relationship dates back to 
mid-1960 and has cost the Soviets, by Washington estimates, at least 
$40-billion in economic aid. Some experts estimate that Soviet aid makes up 
almost 30% of the Cuban gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rupture Not Expected 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets who were interviewed said that a significant rupture is not in 
the cards. "We have maintained good political and economic relations for 30 
years, and these relations are going to be maintained," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Three major Western embassies here agreed that such a break is highly unlikely 
in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
"There are sores there, call them micro-cracks," said one diplomat, "but both 
countries have too large a stake in preserving their relationship to let it 
slip away. They'll work it out." 
</P>
<P>
One European diplomat cited evidence in two recent Castro speeches suggesting 
that a modus vivendi may already have been established that permits the Cuban 
leader to continue his relatively harmless criticism of Soviet domestic policy 
in the name of ideological purity but that forbids him to criticize the 
Kremlin's foreign policy as he did in speeches last July and again on Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Remarks 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat pointed especially to the December speech in which Castro derided 
Gorbachev's peace policies by railing against a peace between the powerful -- 
the United States and Soviet Union -- that allows "war with the small 
revolutionary, socialist or simply independent countries of the Third World." 
It was the same speech in which Castro warned of "difficulties . . . from the 
camp of our own friends." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Moscow jerked his chain for that," said the diplomat, who cited as 
evidence a sharply contrasting Castro speech last Wednesday in which the Cuban 
leader extolled Soviet peace policies and Gorbachev's policy of detente. "That 
sounded like abject rectification," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"It irritates them when he implies that the Soviets with their perestroika 
aren't true to Communist principles, but they can live with that. But when he 
talks about the peace of the rich and says keep an eye on the camp of our 
friends, that's going against the grain of Soviet foreign policy, and they 
won't permit it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Lose Leverage 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat underscored Castro's growing sense of insecurity in the face 
of the new Soviet policy of detente with the United States. "He has to get in 
the flow of U.S.-Soviet relations or lose his leverage with Moscow," he said, 
adding that Cuba's agreement to withdraw its troops from Angola demonstrated 
that Castro recognizes increasing pressures from both East and West against 
such regional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the difficulties over foreign policy, most experts here, including the 
Soviets who were interviewed, agree that Castro's economic difficulties and his 
economic relations with the Soviets are the most overriding. 
</P>
<P>
"Cuban economic life is mainly dependent on our economic relations," said one 
of the local Soviets. "The exchange of products with us represents 75% of total 
Cuban trade. . . . Cuba has to trade with other countries. It isn't good when 
all of the foreign trade is with one partner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sympathy, Not Anger 
</P>
<P>
According to the Soviet source, Moscow feels more sympathy than anger over 
Cuba's predicament in the face of Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived with this (Communist) system for 70 years and Cuba for only 30," 
he said. "Historically, they began with a sort of semi-colonial economy. They 
didn't have the base of trained specialists nor the conditions to organize 
efficiently. Now, the same things that are being criticized in the Soviet Union 
are what is happening here. We've been teaching them how to work all this time, 
and now we're telling them that it isn't efficient. Yet we ourselves do not yet 
have the results of perestroika. Sometimes it's difficult to tell who is bad, 
the students or the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the new Soviet economic approach, which includes borrowing 
productive ideas from the West, will inevitably be adopted by Cuba and other 
socialist countries when it proves itself. "What is required is that other 
countries adapt themselves to our new economy," he said. "In the light of our 
new approach, we don't see any problem if one country criticizes the other or 
thinks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Time Will Show' 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel doesn't agree with us, and we don't agree with him," he added. "If he 
criticizes the perestroika process, we don't want to answer that in public 
discussion now. Time will show." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the Soviet source said that Soviet advisers here are now 
studying what many Washington policy planners will recognize as a particularly 
capitalist idea for Cuban industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on the question of producing shoes and clothing from our own 
materials here with Cuban workers," he said.

KEY VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL ARRIVES IN BEIJING FOR TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
UNANNOUNCED TRIP APPARENTLY IS AIMED AT ENDING DECADE-LONG CAMBODIAN CONFLICT

<P>
A high-ranking Vietnamese official, reported to be Vice Foreign Minister Dinh 
Nho Liem, arrived here Saturday on an unannounced mission apparently aimed at 
ending the Cambodian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam, key backers of the opposing sides in Cambodia, have refused 
to comment on the arrival of the small Vietnamese delegation. But it appears to 
be the beginning of the two nations' most serious contact yet in the search for 
a settlement of the decade-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters hoping to interview the Vietnamese delegation saw a person closely 
resembling Liem through the window of a reception room at Beijing airport. But 
after being greeted by the Vietnamese ambassador and Chinese officials, the man 
left through a back door and was quickly driven away. Vietnamese diplomats 
later declined to say anything. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Passenger List 
</P>
<P>
Liem's name was on the passenger manifest of an Air China flight that left 
Bangkok on Saturday for Canton and Beijing, and Japanese correspondents 
reported seeing Liem at the airport in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
Liem helped negotiate a cease-fire that ended a 1979 border war between Vietnam 
and China. The two countries were allies during the American involvement in the 
Vietnam War, but they later split, largely over the issue of Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi delegation is expected to discuss Vietnamese troop withdrawals from 
Cambodia, the ending of Chinese assistance to resistance forces there and the 
shape of a political settlement, according to diplomats here. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the delegation would also discuss a possible visit to 
Beijing by Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach. Diplomats in Hanoi said 
last week that they expected a senior Vietnamese official to travel to Beijing 
within a few days to arrange a Thach visit. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom 
Sihanouk, said earlier last week on Cambodian resistance radio that China had 
agreed to receive either Vietnam's foreign minister or a deputy in early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks on Summit 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is scheduled to visit Beijing 
early next month for talks on arranging a Sino-Soviet summit later this year. 
Cambodia is also expected to be a topic of Sino-Soviet discussion, because it 
has been a key obstacle to improved relations between China and the Soviet 
Union. Moscow has backed Vietnam's military invasion and continued presence in 
Cambodia but now is pressing Hanoi to pull its troops out. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, currently visiting France, indicated 
Saturday that Sino-Vietnamese relations could also rapidly improve if the 
Cambodian conflict is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Paris, Qian said that "the major obstacle 
blocking relations between China and Vietnam lies in the Vietnamese occupation 
of Cambodia," the official New China News Agency reported. Qian "stressed that 
only by solving this problem can relations between the two countries be 
improved," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has about 100,000 troops in Cambodia but has pledged to pull them out 
by September if a political settlement of the conflict can be agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government is battling against various 
resistance factions. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk heads one of the factions. But the Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia 
with a tyrannical and murderous regime from 1975 until Vietnamese troops drove 
it from power 10 years ago, is the most powerful resistance faction. China has 
supported both the Khmer Rouge and Sihanouk, who have been nominal allies but 
are deeply suspicious of each other. 
</P>
<P>
As the search for a settlement proceeds, a key question is whether terms of a 
peace agreement will include a mechanism to keep the Khmer Rouge from regaining 
power. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, China has indicated that it would be willing to reduce arms 
supplies to the Khmer Rouge as a Vietnamese withdrawal takes place, but it 
insists that the Khmer Rouge be included as one of the parties in any coalition 
government to emerge from a peace agreement.

Forty-eight policemen will have to settle for a job well done instead of the 
expensive watches they received from the president of the United Arab Emirates 
in gratitude for guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not deemed correct that officials receive extra compensation for 
fulfillment of their normal duties," said an Aachen police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The president, Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, gave the Swiss watches to the 
policemen who guarded him during an August, 1987, visit, said the spokesman on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"The watches are worth several thousand marks (more than $1,000) each, and 
officials are questioning the propriety of accepting the gifts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new police chief, Heinrich Boenninghausen, has decided the watches should 
be auctioned off with the money to go to charity, the spokesman said.

POLICE SEIZE 300 POUNDS OF STOLEN PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE

More than 300 pounds of a powerful plastic explosive that had been stolen from 
a mine was seized in a raid by agents who posed as would-be buyers for the 
material, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested Friday night in the raid on a motel where agents had 
rented rooms to arrange the bogus purchase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
There was enough explosive, known as C-3 or Tovex, to blow up a 3-block area, 
said police in this community of 50,000 about 45 miles north of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seize Ammunition 
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, authorities went to the Ft. Collins home of one of the 
suspects, where they seized armor-piercing rifle rounds, thousands of rounds of 
ammunition, an AK-47 rifle, hollow-point revolver rounds and homemade bullets 
designed to pierce bulletproof vests, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Agents also confiscated a number of handguns, switch-blade knives, military 
flak jackets, a scope-mounted AR-15, described as a civilian version of the 
military M-16 rifle, 2,000 blasting caps and a large amount of detonation cord. 
</P>
<P>
Books and magazines about terrorism and survival tactics also were found, 
Longmont police Sgt. Carl McIntyre said.

VOICES CONCERN ABOUT 'LATENT RACISM' AND WORKING HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
QUAYLE PROMISES TO HELP GOP SHED UNCARING IMAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, insisting that his own image has been badly 
distorted, has vowed to help reposition the Republican Party and "cast aside 
this stereotype image that Republicans somehow don't care" about the inner-city 
poor and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
And last Friday, he demonstrated at least a rhetorical sensitivity that often 
has been missing from the Reagan Administration, expressing concern about 
"latent racism" in America and saying that he found it a "startling fact" and a 
"sad comment" that 25% to 30% of the homeless "are working and can't afford a 
home." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not by choice, not by desire. A lot of these people work," he said of the 
homeless. "It's hard to think . . . that in America someone that works can't 
afford a home, can't afford housing, and that's something that has to be 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of GOP Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's comments, in an interview Friday that was being released today, appear 
to reflect a role he will play as vice president. Republican strategists hope 
that as a young, energetic and attractive campaigner, he can serve as a party 
leader for the next generation, broadening the GOP's current white, male, 
Protestant base. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Quayle's statements and background suggest that he has only 
limited experience with the sorts of voters the party hopes he will be able to 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
Both President-elect Bush and Lee Atwater, Bush's choice for party chairman, 
have warned that the GOP must either change with the changing demographics of 
the nation or resign itself to permanent minority status. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that goal, Quayle's sympathetic statements about the problems 
of racism and the homeless were a marked contrast to those often made by Reagan 
Administration officials, including the President. Reagan, for example, only 
recently reiterated his view that many homeless people live on the streets as a 
matter of choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Confront Skepticism 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Quayle may face a measure of skepticism about his own credentials 
as the Republican Party's ambassador to cities and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, he is the product of a state that is overwhelmingly white, 
Protestant and traditionally Republican. The Indiana electorate is about 8% 
black. And Quayle said his own polls show that in his 1986 Senate race, when he 
won 61% of the total vote, his approval rating among black voters was about 
35%. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he had any black advisers, Quayle cited an advisory committee on 
minority issues that he met with "once or twice a year" as a senator from 
Indiana. But he could remember the name of only one member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Listen to People 
</P>
<P>
And after saying that the new Administration needs to "crusade on these issues" 
-- drugs, homelessness, high school dropout rates -- he repeatedly declined to 
offer any specific policy suggestions for such a crusade. His job, Quayle said, 
will be to listen to what people say who are "out where these problems exist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than Money 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of the Bush Administration seeking increased 
federal resources for problem areas, a suggestion frequently made by big-city 
mayors, Quayle said: "I hope we don't get into this situation of saying only 
money counts." 
</P>
<P>
And his public image -- an unfair perception, he insists -- remains that of a 
sheltered scion of a wealthy family with little knowledge of the country's less 
affluent sections. Even his vice presidential campaign manager, longtime 
California political consultant Stuart K. Spencer, said during the campaign 
that Quayle knew little about the people or problems of the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer's statement was "just flat-out wrong," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
The truth, the vice president-elect said in the interview, is that he has 
considerable expertise on such issues as education and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Changing his negative image is the first task Quayle has taken on. After a 
campaign in which he was shunted more and more out of the spotlight as Election 
Day neared and a post-election period of avoiding all on-the-record interviews, 
Quayle and his advisers have decided that the time has come to re-emerge 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aims for New Profile 
</P>
<P>
"I made a calculated decision" to avoid publicity after the end of a 
"difficult" campaign, Quayle said. Now, with Inauguration Day approaching, "I 
will have a different profile." 
</P>
<P>
To build the new profile, Quayle has begun a blizzard of press and television 
interviews all timed to run during the week of the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he says, will come speeches and some political events, including 
fund-raisers for some of his House and Senate friends, some of which he said 
already had been scheduled, although he declined to discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Quayle said, he hopes to visit some cities, traveling to poor 
neighborhoods to talk, particularly with children, about the problems they face 
with drugs, poor schools and crime. He said that he hopes to be able to sit 
down in small groups and ask such questions as "why is crime acceptable?" as a 
way of life in some communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a good track record" on issues such as unemployment and urban 
poverty, he insisted. The record, he said, is unknown to much of the public 
because "they have not been told." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alludes to His Record 
</P>
<P>
While he did not discuss such issues during the campaign and almost never 
visited a major city, "the campaign was three months, and my legislative record 
is eight years. You take your choice." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both he and Bush's aides insist that Quayle will be included in the 
decision-making of the Administration-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
"The only Cabinet appointment that I did not give my prior advice on was 
secretary of state," for which Bush chose his close friend and campaign manager 
James A. Baker III, Quayle said. In addition, he said, he has been promised 
full access both to Bush and to the paper work that flows through the Oval 
Office, a pledge reiterated Friday by John H. Sununu, Bush's designee as chief 
of staff.

TRANSITION AIDES LAND NEW OFFICIALS WHILE BUSH FISHES

Still boasting about the 13-pound bonefish that didn't get away -- until he set 
it free -- President-elect Bush spent the final Saturday before his presidency 
casting off the Florida Keys as advisers fleshed out his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the skepticism given most big fish stories, Bush jocularly presented 
witnesses to his Friday night catch as he departed for a full fishing day, 
waving at onlookers and shouting greetings to a British tourist on a nearby 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
"Would Margaret Thatcher like a little bit of this bonefishing action?" Bush 
asked 52-year-old Maggie Arnold, a hair stylist visiting from Bournemouth, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold vowed to ask the British prime minister for a response when she returned 
home. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, aides announced, he pulled in 25 more fish, including a 2-foot 
shark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasury Officials Named 
</P>
<P>
As Bush relaxed, his transition office in Washington announced the selection of 
four sub-Cabinet Treasury Department officials, all either current Treasury 
employees or affiliated with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Brady was one of several longtime Bush friends who traveled here to fish with 
the President-elect. 
</P>
<P>
David C. Mulford, now an assistant Treasury secretary, was named undersecretary 
for international affairs, and Ede Holiday, also an assistant secretary and the 
director of operations for the Bush campaign, was selected as the department's 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Dallara, an assistant secretary for policy development, will become 
assistant secretary for international affairs, the section to be headed by 
Mulford. And Hollis S. McLoughlin, Brady's chief of staff six years ago when 
the secretary was a U.S. senator from New Jersey, was named assistant secretary 
for policy development. 
</P>

<P>
First Lady's Staff Grows 
</P>
<P>
The soon-to-be First Lady's staff also grew Saturday as transition officials 
announced that Susan Porter Rose would serve as Barbara Bush's chief of staff, 
Anna Maria Perez will be her press secretary, Laurie Firestone her social 
secretary and Julie Cook her director of programs. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is Mrs. Bush's current chief of staff and Firestone has served as her 
social assistant. Perez is the press secretary for Rep. John R. Miller 
(R-Wash.) and Cook worked for the Bush campaign as a liaison for Mrs. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president's wife did not accompany Bush to Florida on the annual 
fishing trip he shares with male friends. Aides said she was packing for the 
move into the White House on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, wearing casual clothes, exhibited good cheer as he took a bit of 
ribbing over his Friday night catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's my witness here," he told reporters, pointing to fishing guide George 
Hommell. 
</P>
<P>
Hommell quipped: "Both of us Georges never lie." 
</P>
<P>
"That's our story and we're staying with it," Bush deadpanned later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers Photo of Fish 
</P>
<P>
Bush also offered to release photographs made of the fish -- which he released 
alive after weighing it -- "if it looks good. It verifies what I said," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
His catch came within 3 pounds of the area record for bonefish, which the 
64-year-old President-elect described as "pound for pound, as fighting a fish 
as there is anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush returns to Washington today with only five days remaining before taking 
the oath as President. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he said he had yet to tackle seriously his inaugural address, 
which is being written by Peggy Noonan, the speech writer who crafted many of 
Ronald Reagan's speeches and was credited with Bush's best campaign efforts. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the holiday commemorating the birthday of civil rights leader Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., Bush will speak at a Washington prayer breakfast 
sponsored by black Americans in honor of King.

A tailgating incident between two motorists on the Antelope Valley Freeway 
erupted into gunfire Friday night when a motorist shot out the window of 
another pickup truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The targeted driver, Charles Chiaramonte, 27, of Lancaster, was not injured in 
the shooting, sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiaramonte told deputies he was driving north on the Antelope Valley Freeway 
near Red Rover Mine Road in the unincorporated Acton area shortly before 8 
p.m., when another pickup began tailgating his truck. 
</P>
<P>
When Chiaramonte braked, the driver pulled in front of him and braked sharply, 
he said. Chiaramonte eventually tried to pass the pickup, saw the driver raise 
his hand and then saw a flash as his door window on the driver's side 
shattered, Wahla said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies traced the license to an address in the Canyon Country area of Santa 
Clarita where they arrested William McLaughlin, 19, Wahla said. Deputies failed 
to find the gun used in the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin was booked at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon and released on $12,000 bail.

LANDLORDS BECOME PRIME TARGET IN LATEST BATTLE TO ABOLISH DRUG HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The old house on Bowden Avenue in Clairemont had been the family home for 
years, but after the kids grew up, Reynaldo and Carmen Inchaurregui moved to a 
new home in South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they kept the Bowden home, converted it into a rental, and for years the 
little one-story family-style house with the red trim and off-white stucco 
exterior served as a tidy rental property for the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Until this summer, when police raided the house and found: 
</P>
<P>
Drugs on top of the stereo. Drugs in a Tupperware container and along a mirror 
shelf in a back bedroom. White powder inside a pillow. A box of syringes under 
a bed. Scales used to measure drugs. A .22-caliber blue-steel revolver. 
Marijuana and drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Threatened to Close 
</P>
<P>
Then the city threatened to close the home under a new San Diego Drug Abatement 
Task Force program created by police and City Hall to go after property owners 
-- rather than just drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"A detective called us up one day and said they'd busted the place," said the 
couple's son, Rey (Cherokee) Inchaurregui Jr. "The detective told my mom that, 
if the drug activity continued, the city could actually sue to take the home 
away from us. That really shook us up." 
</P>
<P>
The Inchaurreguis did the smart thing. They evicted the tenants. They cleaned 
out the debris. They repainted the house. And now they have a new, responsible 
family living in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Others have not been so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
The Bowden Avenue home is one of 15 properties reviewed by The Times that 
police have identified in recent years as being among the city's worst drug 
houses. In the past two years, police raided all 15 homes and came away with 
large amounts of drugs, cash and illegal weapons. Many of the tenants have been 
jailed and the drug houses shut down. In some cases, the windows and doors have 
been boarded up and the properties abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absentee Landlords 
</P>
<P>
Many of the houses were assigned to the Drug Abatement Task Force after 
individual arrests of drug dealers and police searches failed to shut down the 
drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them are owned by absentee landlords, and, in some cases, the owners 
could not be found by The Times at the addresses listed in the county's 
property records. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the owners live in Hawaii and Beverly Hills, so far away that they 
could not easily keep tabs on the rental properties. Another property owner who 
lives in the Banker's Hill area of San Diego has been so afraid to visit her 
rental property a few miles away in the Southeast that today it is boarded up 
and empty. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the owners of one drug house turned out to be the parents of an 
officer with the San Diego Police Department's Narcotics Street Team. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the owners said they never knew that their buildings were problem 
properties until the Drug Abatement Task Force notified them that drugs were 
being sold there. 
</P>
<P>
Created in the fall of 1987, the task force is composed of members of the 
Narcotics Street Team and other anti-drug units, the city attorney's office, 
the Fire Department, and representatives of the city's housing and 
building-code enforcement divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of the task force is 
</P>
<P>
simple: Drug dealers rarely own the property they use to sell their wares, and, 
when police come around, the criminals just move to a new location. Officials 
believe that property owners are more susceptible to pressures from police and 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dealing with the 'Miami Vice,' Don Johnson type of dealers who live 
in big mansions and act as drug wholesalers," said Joseph M. Schilling, a head 
deputy city attorney who helped create the task force. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with the retailers. We're trying to provide more relief to the 
individual neighborhoods. They're the ones who are being terrorized by the 
drive-by shootings and drug dealing and gang warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dan Berglund, head of the police Narcotics Street Team and chairman of the 
Drug Abatement Task Force, said arresting and jailing drug dealers is often a 
frustrating process because the crowded jails and courts put the criminals back 
on the streets. Going after the owners of the properties adds a new dimension 
to the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets the absentee owner off the dime," he said. "When we come looking, he 
realizes he's going to be impacted in his wallet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Members Cross-Trained 
</P>
<P>
The task force members are cross-trained so that building inspectors are able 
to spot illegal drug residue while reviewing a home, and police officers can 
recognize fire and safety code violations while serving search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
They meet informally once a month, share information, and attempt to identify 
properties that they believe constitute a public nuisance. Then they warn the 
property owners that they will be taken to court if they don't shut down the 
drug houses. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 properties reviewed by The Times were at various times scrutinized by 
the task force for drug violations. But many of them were dropped from the task 
force's hit list after the owners evicted the tenants or the drug dealers were 
arrested or moved to evade police. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, the task force's involvement has brought about a wide range of 
results: 
</P>
<P>
* A house on Olivewood Terrace is the only property that actually has been shut 
down for a year by the task force because of repeat drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The owner eventually lost the property in a bank foreclosure. But the drug 
dealing has resumed, and the task force now is negotiating with the out-of-town 
mortgage lender to clean up the premises. 
</P>
<P>
* Another property near 30th and Commercial streets was such a mess that the 
plumbing company that owned the site simply tore the building down this summer. 
</P>
<P>
* A home in Del Cerro, worth probably $250,000, was owned by a woman who lived 
in Guadalupe, Calif. Her son lived in the Del Cerro home until the task force 
came calling. Then the woman evicted her son, police arrested him, and she put 
money into rehabilitating the property. 
</P>
<P>
Many property owners and managers, such as Steve Thomas of SCT Properties, said 
they do all they can to keep their homes occupied by law-abiding citizens. They 
said they carefully screen prospective tenants to eliminate any suspected drug 
dealers. And they said they try to act responsibly by evicting tenants involved 
in drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas manages a triplex building in the 4000 block of Newton Avenue that was 
twice raided and where drugs, cash and guns was recovered. He said he was 
notified by police about the problems after the raids. And, although police 
expect him to immediately evict errant tenants, he said he actually must follow 
a lengthy and complicated legal process to remove many problem tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just go out and change the locks," he said. "It takes three weeks to 
get somebody legally evicted. Well, in 18 or 20 days, a hell of a lot of drug 
dealing can go on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dealers Became Squatters 
</P>
<P>
Other property owners said that many seemingly responsible tenants hand the 
house keys over to drug dealers and then move out. The dealers then become 
squatters, and it is difficult to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
But the task force maintains that no matter what happens inside a rental 
property, it is the owner who must be held ultimately responsible. When the 
task force identifies a drug house, warning letters are sent to the owners 
advising them that the property is a public nuisance and could come under civil 
abatement procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has evaluated about 60 properties so far, and half of them were 
considered to have serious enough violations that the task force declared them 
public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the property owners quickly and voluntarily complied. Either the drug 
dealers were arrested and the houses cleaned up, or the owners quickly evicted 
the tenants. Many of the owners also underwent counseling on how to choose 
tenants and monitor the activities at their rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has filed civil complaints in five more cases, alleging that the 
owners are maintaining a public nuisance where drugs are sold, used or 
distributed. Maximum penalties include a one-year mandatory closing of the 
property, a $25,000 fine, the seizure of personal property and fixtures in the 
house and the repayment of city attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Another five cases are being prepared for abatement proceedings, and Berglund 
and Schilling met recently to discuss ways to broaden the group's efforts. "At 
this point in time," Schilling said, "anything is going to be welcome news in 
the war against drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The war against drug house owners has led in many directions, and, in one case, 
to a place a block away from San Diego police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Last August and September, police raided a three-story apartment building in 
the 1400 block of F Street. They found marijuana, methamphetamine and "white 
powder;" a rifle, a revolver and a loaded .44 magnum; a blue book with drug 
records; syringes hidden in a jewelry box and more than $7,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly they sold reefer and crystal," said Marty Meyers, using colloquial 
references for marijuana and methamphetamine respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Prostitutes "hung around with whoever sold the crystal. Clients hung around 
with the dealers," said Meyers, who has lived in the 16-unit building for a 
year and now manages the apartments. "Somebody else sold the needles. Somebody 
else was here because there was money and he was fencing stolen goods. We had 
hot cars and stolen motorcycles lined up out back. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no control of the building. Whoever was the strongest and had the 
most money ran the building. And everybody catered to whoever had the drugs. 
People ran through here wondering 'Who's got the crystal?' It was like a 
shopping mall in here every night. And somebody's light was always on." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said that Harold Kaemerle, one of the owners, suspected that something 
was going on inside the building but never realized how bad it was until he met 
police outside the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"I went over to check on things and the manager was unshaven," said Kaemerle, 
who owns Emerald Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"He personally looked like he hadn't been taking care of himself for a couple 
of days. His place was filled with trash. There were a bunch of undesirable 
characters hanging around outside. The day we went over to fire him, the police 
had just taken him away." 
</P>
<P>
Kaemerle escaped the abatement process because he evicted most of the tenants, 
spruced up the building and hired Meyers as the new manager. "This was a real 
eye-opener for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patti McWay, a Bankers' Hill real estate broker, acknowledged that she failed 
to closely monitor a home she owns in the 2900 block of Webster Street for 
about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
She said a neighbor warned her that the house was a drug stronghold, but McWay 
was so scared of the neighborhood in Southeast San Diego that she refused to go 
there and inspect the property. Once she even had a prospective buyer, but 
turned down his offers because she couldn't muster the courage to meet him at 
the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, she was notified by the task force that the property had been 
the site of numerous drug arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"Police said this had been going on for over a year," she said. She met with 
task force members, and came away feeling as if the whole problem was hers 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are a major problem in this town," she said. "And anything to rectify 
it, I am for it. But their reaction is as though I hired these people to live 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
The tenants moved out to elude police, who had found balloons of heroin under 
the carpet and inside the toilet. McWay boarded up the house. A large white 
"Abatement Order" sign declaring the structure a drug house was posted on all 
four walls outside. And McWay was left stuck with a mortgage and no incoming 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to sell that place forever," she said. "But anybody driving by 
there, when they see the people standing out in the corner, nobody wants it." 
</P>
<P>
At an apartment building in the 2200 block of K Street, a large group of 
children lives and plays in the three-story structure where drug dealers have 
occupied a room on the third floor. The front porch is torn down, and rusty 
nails lie exposed where Maria Venita's five children play tag. 
</P>
<P>
Police have served four search warrants at the house in the last two years, 
coming away with drugs and guns and large amounts of loose cash. 
</P>
<P>
Everett Cooney, who keeps a second-floor apartment, has seen his car broken 
into three times. He has also seen police take away other tenants and their 
guests at least once a month. Once, he said, police handcuffed a 14-year-old 
girl and led her out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common knowledge that, when you want something, this is where to go," he 
said. "A lot of people come up here and stay only five minutes. They come in 
upright and they leave staggering." 
</P>
<P>
The building owner, Delbert E. Zachay, acknowledged that he has had problems 
with drug-dealing tenants. "But I don't know of anybody right now that's been 
doing drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized police for not jailing enough dope pushers and addicts. He 
said police are too slow to respond to calls, and that police seem generally 
unconcerned about landlord-tenant problems that involve drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The police just do their own thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schilling, the head deputy city attorney, scoffed at Zachay's assertions. 
"He tries to manage a lot of properties without the proper support," Schilling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another drug house turned out to be owned by the parents of an officer on the 
Narcotics Street Team. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Max Camberos said he knew his father, Jose, was having problems with 
the tenants in the apartment above a grocery near 22nd Street and Logan Avenue. 
But what he didn't know was that his colleagues on the Narcotics Street Team 
considered it a drug house and raided the property in 1987. They found 27 
bindles of cocaine and police undercover drug-buy money inside. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had people who used drugs and occupied it," Max said. "But I don't 
know that it qualifies as a shooting gallery. He's always tried to keep a clean 
clientele. And every time we've ever had a problem, we've called the police." 
</P>
<P>
Camberos said the property has since been cleaned up.

TRAINING FOR FUTURE JOBS ON THE RISE FOR PRISON'S INMATE BAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buried in the prison landscape of cement cellblocks, watchtowers and 
barbed-wire fences is a building warmed by the smell of a staple of life -- 
fresh-made bread. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the bakery at the state's Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, 
where inmates produce white and wheat bread to help feed the facility's 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell them (prison officials) this, but I'd work for free, just to pass 
the time," said inmate Mike Warner, who is making 25 cents an hour as a lead 
"dough man." He helps oversee the initial creative stage, the mixing of the 
dough to make the bread. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come in here and benefit myself more," said John Briseno of 
Bakersfield, who works as a dough mixer. "I can learn more about being a baker 
so I can look for a baker's job when I get out." 
</P>
<P>
Briseno, who has 2 1/2 years left to serve on a residential robbery conviction, 
said the money he makes as a prison baker allows him to buy "toothpaste, 
shampoo and cards to send to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Warner, convicted of attempted murder eight years ago, is counting on his 
bakery and supervisory experience to help him set up his own business when he 
gets out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom and I are planning to open a restaurant when I get out," said Warner, 
who is from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
George Ford II of Los Angeles, who is serving a 3-year sentence for armed 
robbery, worked in the prison's canteen and laundry before switching to the 
bakery when it went on line last May. 
</P>
<P>
"I love working in the bakery because I've never had this experience before," 
said Ford, who works around the bakery's 43-foot-long oven making sure the 
bread bakes properly and workers abide by safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the civilian bakery superintendent overseeing the inmates' work, 
Tony Angelini, "has been an inspiration to me. He's teaching me how to be the 
best oven man there is. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it interesting to see the flour and the yeast put together to make a 
loaf of bread, and it tastes good," Ford said. "I'm used to going to the 
supermarket, and there it was. I never knew the inner workings of bread." 
</P>
<P>
The bakery is an operation of the Prison Industry Authority, a division of the 
state Department of Corrections. The statewide authority still maintains its 
best-known industry -- the manufacture of license plates using inmate labor -- 
but prisoners increasingly are being exposed to varied occupations, ones they 
can use when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
"We can offer these men the skills that will make them a viable part of society 
when they get out," said Mario Luque, a production manager for the authority at 
the San Diego prison. "But it's like leading a horse to water. It still comes 
back to an individual thing." 
</P>
<P>
The prison authority is developing seven enterprises at the San Diego prison. 
</P>
<P>
The authority's jobs are the most desirable to inmates because they pay by the 
hour, giving prisoners a chance to make a little more money than they would if 
they worked for the state in a kitchen, prison fire department, or yard cleanup 
job at a flat monthly rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, for each day they work here, they get a day off their sentence," 
Angelini said. 
</P>
<P>
The authority, which employs 42% of the inmates statewide, starts its workers 
at 25 cents an hour for a monthlong probationary period. The inmates work a 
minimum 30-hour week and their pay can escalate in 5-cent increments over 
varied periods of time to a maximum of 90 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"The pay and conditions are so good as compared to other (prison) jobs that 
nobody wants to mess it up," Warner said, when asked how the prison bakers got 
along with one another on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Authority enterprises in the works at the prison include an optical laboratory 
for production of prescription and safety glasses, a laundry center, an auto 
refurbishing shop, a license plate plant, key data entry, and a textile mill to 
produce inmate clothing. Also, the authority will have a shipping and receiving 
and maintenance enterprise to support its production entities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Prison Industry Authority is designed to eliminate idleness among inmates, 
to keep them working," said Carlos Chavez, the authority administrator at the 
San Diego prison. "In the prison environment, idleness is your No. 1 concern." 
</P>
<P>
Products made by the authority are, by law, sold only to tax-supported 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't compete with the public," Luque said.

But state, county and local governments save millions of dollars each year by 
purchasing authority goods, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy from us like they would any other outside vendor," Chavez said. "But 
we're highly competitive. We don't pay minimum wage and we're not designed to 
make a profit, just to break even . . . to be self-sufficient."

The prison bakery, for instance, sells the bread to the state for 46.5 cents a 
loaf, well under the going rate on the open market.

STORM-BATTERED KING HARBOR SEEING SIGNS OF RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after the start of a series of storm and fire disasters, King Harbor in 
Redondo Beach is on the way to recovery, city officials and harbor business 
people say. 
</P>
<P>
More than $31 million in private and public improvement projects are completed, 
in progress or being planned to restore the harbor as a major South Bay 
recreational area before the city's centennial observance in 1992, said Harbor 
Director Sheila Schoettger. 
</P>
<P>
"When all the scars are gone, King Harbor will be even more beautiful," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger acknowledged, however, that the city has financial hurdles to 
overcome, including raising $6 million needed to reconstruct the 60-year-old 
Horseshoe Pier, most of which was destroyed by fire in May. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted in September to restore the pier after some contended 
that the pier attracted gangs and caused traffic congestion while others 
maintained that it was essential. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 32 shops and restaurants of the original 48 are still in business on 
the south section of the Horseshoe and the adjacent Monstad Pier. Merchants say 
the number of visitors has dropped substantially -- partly, they say, because 
many people think the pier area was wiped out by the fire and storms last year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people living within six or eight blocks who have not checked yet to 
see whether anybody's left here," said Chuck Milner, owner of the Pier Import 
Shop. 
</P>
<P>
Milner and his wife, Judy, lost a cluster of four other shops in the Edge 
Restaurant building when two sides of the pier were damaged in the January and 
April storms and then finished off by the fire and more high waves in May. 
</P>
<P>
Some shop owners have lost more than half of their customers, he said, partly 
because there are fewer places to attract visitors to the pier area. 
</P>
<P>
The January storm also demolished the Blue Moon Saloon and heavily damaged 
Reuben's Restaurant and the Portofino Inn, all on the harbor shore north of the 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration of those restaurants is in the planning or construction stages, 
with Reuben's and the Portofino planning to reopen in June. 
</P>
<P>
To protect King Harbor, the U.S. Corps of Engineers plans to raise the south 
portion of the harbor's northern breakwater about 5 feet to the 20-foot-plus 
level of the rest of the barrier. The shorter southern breakwater will be 
doubled in length to 600 feet to head off waves at the harbor entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.9-million breakwater project is expected to be completed in early 1991, 
with the city paying 35% of the cost and the federal government paying the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettger said the city has applied for a loan from the state to cover its 
share of the breakwater project, but financing for the new pier "is much less 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
Possible avenues, she said, include a bond issue, a bank loan and contributions 
from businesses and individuals. She said those contributions have reached 
$30,000 without a major fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
A design committee is scheduled to select a firm by early February to draft 
initial proposals. If all goes well, construction on the pier, possibly using 
steel or concrete pilings instead of wood, could start late this year or in 
early 1990, Schoettger said.

CHANGING OF THE OLD GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY CLUB'S MOVE TO TOWER STIRS BROUHAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 81 years, the University Club has attracted San Diego's most influential 
citizens to its downtown confines, a private place where bankers and financiers 
-- for most of those years, all men -- sat at a large, round table cutting 
their business deals, right along with their roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, only the Cuyamaca Club rivaled it for prominence. But that 
competition, or what was left of it, ended in 1987 when the ailing, 99-year-old 
Cuyamaca Club closed its doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
But now it is the University Club that is tottering on the edge of oblivion: it 
is deeply in debt, the clubhouse property is for sale, membership is dwindling 
and club facilities are frayed and dowdy. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save the institution and its traditions, a majority of members 
voted to join a new "club," one that will be operated by a Texas-based 
conglomerate that manages a chain of private city clubs, country clubs, golf 
courses, athletic clubs and resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The new club is being built across the street from the University Club, on the 
34th -- and top -- floor of San Diego's tallest building, Symphony Towers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement between the two clubs, the University Club will 
essentially cease to exist; will turn over use of its name to the new club, 
which will be formally called the University Club Atop Symphony Towers, and 
will pay $200,000 so that up to 450 members can join without paying the new 
club's $1,000 initiation fee. 
</P>
<P>
To the majority, it's a good deal, the best way to keep the club and its 
traditions alive. The alternative, they argue, is to dissolve the club and bury 
its history. 
</P>
<P>
But, to a membership minority, which wants to resurrect the University Club and 
restore it to its bygone luster, the decision is nothing short of treason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Directors Sold Us Down the River' 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, our own board of directors (has) sold us down the river," said one 
of the dissidents, Raymond Contreras, a Chula Vista lawyer who has hinted that 
he and others opposing the move might seek legal action. 
</P>
<P>
As a backdrop to this internal conflict is the question of whether today's San 
Diego is really a private-club town, whether the booming city and its legions 
of transient executives need or will support an exclusive downtown club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Such a debate would have seemed far-fetched in 1908, when a group of men 
organized the University Club. The club moved to its current location, at 7th 
Avenue and A Street, 73 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the University Club became a beacon for downtown's business 
community, an all-male bastion whose members could share a meal and conduct 
business in a relaxed and cozy environment. There were private dining rooms, a 
library, a weight room in the basement, and a fireplace in the cocktail lounge, 
as well a regular round of social events. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the old and creaky clubhouse was demolished and replaced with a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the then-modern facility, membership soon began to dip and the club was 
eventually hit with its first economic crisis. An effort was made to sell the 
clubhouse. There were no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
There was talk of moving to the beach as a way of adding pizazz and attracting 
more members. But it never went beyond talk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Became Members 
</P>
<P>
Not all was bad news, though. Women, for example, were finally accepted as 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Things seemed to turn around for a while in the '80s. Membership rose briefly 
to about 700. But, as downtown became more developed and more attractive 
restaurants were opened, the University Club felt the pressure and again began 
losing members in large numbers. Today its membership stands at about 430, and 
is dropping at the rate of 2% a month. 
</P>
<P>
With the decrease came fewer dues: From about $39,000 a month in early 1986, to 
less than $26,000 a month now. Recently, dues were increased, from $60 to $80 a 
month. But it hasn't stemmed the financial hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
During six of the last nine years, the club has operated at a loss, including a 
net loss of $38,552 in fiscal year 1988. To stay afloat, the club has had to 
borrow money from banks, principally from San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debt Piling Up 
</P>
<P>
Debt has been piled upon debt, including the original loan to build the 
clubhouse in 1970. Depending on who is counting, the current debt is at least 
$700,000, and some members say that, because even more money has been borrowed 
to pay for joining the new Symphony Towers club, it may be more like $1.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult for a number of years," said Robert Scott, president of 
the University Club and owner of an engineering firm. "We've had to struggle to 
keep above the water. We've kept operations alive often by borrowing against 
our property. We've used it as collateral for loans to continue the club." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the club's board of directors formed a committee to explore the 
possibility of moving the club. The committee contacted Charlton Raynd 
Development, a limited partnership that was planning to build the Symphony 
Towers, consisting of both a high-rise hotel and separate office tower over San 
Diego's Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It was Charlton Raynd's plan to build a top-of-the-line, private dining and 
social club on the top floor of the building, which has sweeping views of 
downtown, the bay and the ocean. The firm chose as manager of the facility the 
Club Corporation of America, a huge company with more than 11,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
By December, 1987, negotiations to move the University Club to Symphony Towers 
were being held in earnest, with the club's committee seeking, under orders of 
its board of directors, the best possible arrangement for the club and its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3-to-1 Vote Ratified Move 
</P>
<P>
By March of last year, a tentative agreement was reached, calling for 
dissolving the University Club and paying to join the new Symphony Towers club. 
In early June, the board approved the tentative pact. At a special meeting June 
28, the membership voted 156 to 58 to approve the agreement; a later vote 
reaffirmed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to several dissident members, the negotiations with Club 
Corporation of America had been held in secret and little was known about the 
proposed agreement until shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some members complained bitterly, accusing the board of directors 
of incompetence and charging that not enough had been done to see whether the 
club could be kept intact. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to derail the deal, a group of dissidents ran for positions on the 
board, but were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the complaints, the board of directors formed a new committee 
last summer and instructed it to evaluate the University Club's physical 
condition and estimate the cost of upgrading the facility. The committee's 
report, made in August, put the cost of extensive changes in the three-story, 
45,000-square-foot building -- from expanding the gym to modernizing the 
kitchen -- at $870,000. The cost was considered by many to be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Resisting Move 
</P>
<P>
The group of dissidents -- called the Committee to Revitalize the Club -- has 
continued to try to scuttle the move, with little luck. They say they represent 
100 members or more, while the majority says the group represents just a 
handful of disgruntled people. A club document, identifying those who resigned 
last summer and fall, shows that 30% to 40% said they were leaving because of 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to organize the Old Guard in an attempt to stop the move," said 
Jim Hildreth, a real estate agent who has been a member for about 15 years, 
following in the footsteps of his father, who was also a member. He and other 
dissidents believe the club's financial plight has been exaggerated, pointing 
to 1986, when the club had an operating profit of nearly $80,000. "What we've 
needed is better financial management," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others are more strident and emotional. They call the demise of the University 
Club a calculated move to get rid of the biggest competitor to the Symphony 
Towers club, and they say that a serious look at reorganizing and refinancing 
the club hasn't been made. 
</P>
<P>
But those representing the majority say the club's problems, financial and 
physical, are just too great to overcome. Spending hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to make changes is no guarantee the club will be successful, they say, 
even if the added financial burden is dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
What's changed, they say, is not the club or its problems, but the situation: 
The opportunity to join a new club without having to worry about the legal and 
financial responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Viable Alternative' 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a 20-year-old building like we have, you have two choices," said 
William C. Conrad, former club vice president and senior vice president of San 
Diego Trust &amp; Savings. "One, you either close or disband, or two, you look 
for a viable alternative . . . that keeps traditions of the club and the 
membership intact. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always going to have people who disagree with what the majority wants 
to do. . . . It comes down to an individual-type decision. If you don't want to 
be involved, then you have the choice of not being associated with the club. 
Instead, (the dissidents are) trying to throw roadblocks at the feet of the 
majority." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dissidents have implicitly suggested that it was San Diego Trust 
&amp; Savings that pushed for the move, so that its loans could be paid back 
when the club building is sold. But Conrad says that was never a concern of 
either the bank or the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The club has had so much trouble paying its debts that the bank has always had 
the option of foreclosure, even before the Symphony Towers club entered the 
picture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the University Club to survive . . . and it wasn't looking like it 
would," Conrad said. "The benefit of (Symphony Towers) is that they will have 
professional managers. That was part of our problems -- we're not in the 
business of being club managers. We're basically a group of business guys who 
get together once a month or so, and we basically don't have the professional 
managers to run it on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
"What is comes down to is, can you continue to lose members and increase dues 
and survive in this new era we're in? The answer is, no, you can't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
End of Private Clubs? 
</P>
<P>
Just what kind of era is it? Apparently not a good one for private clubs in San 
Diego, unless they are close to the water, such as the San Diego Yacht Club or 
the Kona Kai Club. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy MacHutchin-Case says a downtown private club faces several obstacles. She 
knows about this firsthand -- two years ago she was hired to breathe life back 
into the Cuyamaca Club. Despite her efforts, the club, atop the Executive 
Hotel, closed for good last year. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego isn't a private-club town at this time," she said. "The problem is 
the private clubs haven't kept in touch with the times. In their heyday, there 
were not many places to get a good meal downtown . . . . so the clubs served as 
places where you, as a businessman, could eat and where you had to be to make 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
"But the deals these days are being made at Dobson's, the Pacific Grill, the 
Gran Tapa," she said. "There's no longer just one place to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the tradition of the University Club is going away. It's 
the last of its kind. But from an economic point of view, and I've been there, 
it's probably a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Club Corporation of America said that with downtown's continued 
growth, the company is very optimistic about the new University Club Atop 
Symphony Towers, which is tentatively scheduled to open in April. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate because we'll have a tremendous tradition when we open. We 
want to perpetuate that," the spokesman said. The new club's board of governors 
will be the same as the University Club's board of directors, and several of 
the old club's amenities, such as the large round table and photographs, will 
be moved to the new club. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition from some University Club members, the Club Corporation 
of America spokesman said that 384, or 90% of all current members, have stated 
that they plan to join the new club. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the University Club property is for sale. John Donovan of John 
Burnham &amp; Co., which is handling the sale, said the asking price is $2.75 
million for the property. He said two counteroffers are being evaluated. Most 
likely, he said, the building will be used for offices for a few years before 
being razed for a higher-density development. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, the club president, said the club has lost so much of its pizazz that 
few members are even dropping by anymore for one last look. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," he said, "the curtains have just gotten too faded."

SELF-PITYING PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Peace's flippant dismissal of his deplorable record during 
the past Assembly term has to rank as one of the more egregious examples of 
political hubris in recent memory ("Power Shift Aside, Steve Peace Isn't 
Conceding Defeat," Dec. 27). 
</P>
<P>
Calling the "effective" members of the Assembly "clowns," Peace has concluded 
that it is no "big deal" that for more than two years he has neither authored 
nor sponsored any successful legislation of any kind, let alone any benefiting 
the district he was elected to represent. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's self-pitying and cynical comments are unworthy of an elected 
representative, and evince a lamentable lack of concern for his representative 
responsibilities. What Mr. Peace apparently fails to realize is that, while he 
has been consumed with attempting to advance his own personal political 
ambitions, the needs and interests of his constituents, and those of his 
district, suffer from an appalling neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Problems such as Mexican sewage spillover, the steady deterioration of some of 
the more blighted areas of the district and other pressing environmental 
concerns have been left unattended and unaddressed. 
</P>
<P>
Peace's blithe dismissal of the consequences of his ineffectiveness 
demonstrates an insensitivity that only serves to reinforce the notion that his 
conduct deserves the severest sanction. 
</P>
<P>
Peace has admitted that, during the past two years, he has considered 
"quitting" the Assembly. Given his overriding animus toward his colleagues, and 
his indifference to his representative obligations, it is indeed remarkable 
that the voters of the 80th District have not yet made the decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
One hopes that in the next primary election, the voters will base their 
decision both on Peace's meager record and his rhetoric.

STAND SHOWED COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm filled with admiration for Rod Tompkins, the savings and loan officer who 
wrote Judge John Rhoades asking justice for Daniel Dierdorff ("S&amp;L Official 
Pleads Against Lenient Dierdorff Sentence," Jan. 7). 
</P>
<P>
I agree 100% with Tompkins. I think there have been far too many judicial wrist 
slaps for business executives who've broken laws, in contrast with tough 
sentences often given to such people as Tompkins' teller who have not enjoyed 
exalted status. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the merit of Tompkins' views, I applaud his courage in making them 
known. I don't think it takes any great courage to write pleas for leniency or 
character references -- unless the subject is Charles Manson. But it does take 
courage to ask the opposite for somebody who has been prominent, and who 
actually has been in the same field as the writer, particularly when what's 
written may be publicized. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine Tompkins will be harshly criticized -- perhaps ostracized -- by some 
of his associates. I'm sure, however, there are many who feel as I do, that he 
did what was right, and are glad he had the courage to do it.

GLARING HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere is the gap between goals and accomplishments more evident than 
in the annual ritual of the State of the City address. 
</P>
<P>
The address is one of the highlights of the mayor's ceremonial leadership, 
giving her the opportunity to cite her accomplishments and her priorities for 
the coming year. Last year, Mayor Maureen O'Connor chose a Soviet arts festival 
as the goal she would showcase, and indeed she has made considerable progress 
toward that goal. She has put together more than $5 million for the festival, a 
proposal she sponsored almost single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she has declared that improving programs for children is her goal. 
We hope that O'Connor feels even more strongly about the "Year of the Child" 
than she did about the "Year of the Arts." The needs of children urgently need 
attention. And she has shown that she can raise funds when she puts her heart 
into a project. 
</P>
<P>
But we were dismayed by how lightly she dismissed some unmet goals she has 
espoused in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The failed efforts to produce a growth-management plan, which took up much of 
the City Council's and community's civic energy last year, is the most glaring 
example. First, the council and the mayor abdicated their responsibility by 
deciding to put the plan on the ballot rather than adopting it outright. Then, 
the council adopted a plan with the flaws of too many compromises. Finally, the 
mayor sat on the sidelines during most of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the city still does not have the growth-management plan that 
it needs. Yet this fact merited only a sentence in the annual report and no 
mention in the speech. 
</P>
<P>
We know there are limitations to a State of the City address and even an annual 
report. And there are limitations to the power of the office of mayor under San 
Diego's council-manager form of government. 
</P>
<P>
But surely San Diegans deserve at least a mention of the issue that dominated 
the civic agenda last year. A glimpse of the mayor's revised goals on growth 
management would have fit in nicely in a speech dedicated to the future.

Your recent series on the future of the San Dieguito River Valley (Dec. 25-27) 
gave your readers an in-depth look at the very complex issues confronting this 
sensitive part of San Diego's landscape. The evolving effort to establish a 
linear, natural park along the river valley is a laudable goal, which property 
owners, other environmentalists and all San Diegans should strive to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Los Angeles Times has failed to explore seriously the 
opportunities to accomplish the goal of creating the San Dieguito River Park in 
the foreseeable future. Your coverage on the complex issues involved, in 
particular the story on the San Dieguito Trust ownership in the valley, focused 
on past controversies, accusations and personalities rather than exploring the 
numerous opportunities for realistic solutions to the problems facing park 
plans. The promise of the park would have been better served by an examination 
of future alternatives for the valley. 
</P>
<P>
The San Dieguito Trust owns 368 acres, just east of Interstate 5, at the 
entrance to the San Dieguito River Valley. The trust, composed of seven 
separate families plus Scripps College and the National Academy of Sciences, 
has owned this property for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
All of the San Dieguito Trust owners share a commitment to work cooperatively 
with the city and county of San Diego to help realize the goal of creating a 
linear park. Over the years, we have chosen not to develop our property in 
anticipation that someday we could achieve a reasonable economic return through 
a sensitive development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than posing a roadblock to park planning, as your article suggests, the 
San Dieguito Trust ownership offers perhaps the greatest opportunity to realize 
the creation of the river park. The city and county have limited financial 
resources and can never expect to acquire all of the land needed for a viable 
park with tax dollars alone. Only through cooperative efforts with landowners 
and other agencies can these limited resources be maximized. 
</P>
<P>
It is disappointing that your article failed to examine the exciting 
alternative of public agency and landowner cooperation in greater depth. Only 
with a new commitment toward such cooperation can park planning proceed 
successfully. I can only hope that San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, other interested groups and individuals can come to recognize this 
before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Name-calling and false accusations will get us nowhere. Cooperation alone can 
preserve the San Dieguito River Valley and give San Diego an impressive new 
park.

AIRPORT LAND MAY SOON BE DEVELOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Marcellus and his neighbors call it a no man's land: 240 vacant acres 
where a thriving neighborhood was destroyed by the jet age. 
</P>
<P>
On a site where single-family homes on oversized lots once stood, streets lead 
nowhere and lampposts have been stripped of their globes. A small radar 
facility and occasional interlopers -- teen-agers looking for a place to party, 
people watching planes take off and land -- are the sole signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it is flat-out depressing," said Marcellus, a 38-year-old attorney who 
lives near the empty property, immediately north of Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The land out there is just a constant reminder that a good part of Westchester 
was gobbled up and taken away." 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than a decade since the Los Angeles Department of Airports 
finished acquiring the 2,834 tract homes that dotted the property. The 
acquisition began after the airport's two north runways were completed in 1970 
and some residents in the area began complaining about jet noise. The city 
allowed the airport to condemn all homes within 700 feet of the northernmost 
runway -- the area deemed to be adversely affected. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 7,000 people were forced to find new places to live. Some went 
willingly; others fought hard to stay, but in vain. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the controversies and bad blood that the condemnations created, the 
department has moved gingerly to develop the land, even though environmental 
and zoning approvals to build a commercial development on the property were 
granted more than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it appears that a low-density development could be imminent. Last 
week, airport officials held what is expected to be the last public workshop to 
discuss building guidelines for the property. Those guidelines are expected to 
be sent to airport commissioners this spring for approval, and developers could 
be asked to submit construction proposals by this summer, LAX officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some who either lived on the property or still reside near it would prefer that 
nothing be built on the land. Still angry over the airport's acquisition, they 
say that if the land is unsuitable for homes, nothing else should be built 
there. Others say they think the land should be turned into a park. 
</P>
<P>
But Marcellus, as well as numerous Westchester business owners, are 
enthusiastic about the prospect of the land finally being developed with office 
buildings, hotels, restaurants and light industrial buildings. Development, 
they contend, should pump new life into the community's downtown business area, 
which was hit hard when the homes were purchased and people drifted away. 
</P>
<P>
"The business district has never fully recovered" from the condemnations, said 
Howard Drollinger, a longtime Westchester developer who owns land in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is going to pull this whole area up by its bootstraps," predicted 
Jerry Epstein, the airport commissioner working most closely on the project. "I 
think the land values all around that (development) are going to skyrocket." 
</P>
<P>
Although it may appear to have taken a long time to draw up a development 
scheme for the property, airport officials said developers initially showed 
little interest in the land. Additionally, the property was subjected to 
protracted hearings by city planners, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schoenfeld, deputy executive director of the Department of Airports, said 
the department, which paid between $300,000 and $400,000 an acre for the land, 
is not wedded to a particular type of development. He said the agency has spent 
a great deal of effort attempting to build "positive credibility" with the 
community and its political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be sure as we moved ahead that we had the community, as well as 
the people representing those people, on our side," Schoenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Opposed 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the area, said the 
current low-density type of development proposed for the property has sparked 
no organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But some former residents don't like the idea of a development where their 
homes once stood. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised us that that land would not be used for anything but airfield 
purposes," said Dick Kerker, a 72-year-old retired aerospace engineer whose 
home was condemned against his wishes. He now lives about a mile north of the 
site. " . . . The whole area is being ruined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Koster, who lives across the street from the property, said he 
unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the department to purchase his home, but 
it did not fall within the area calculated to be severely affected by jet 
noise. He said he is worried that any development on the property could pose 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A commercial development may increase the value of our property, but on the 
other hand, we are going to have horrible traffic around here," the 77-year-old 
Koster said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental plans for the project calculate that development could generate 
60,000 vehicle trips a day into the immediate area. To handle some of the 
traffic, the airport -- or the developers -- will be required to build a 
four-lane highway that will extend the entire length of the project from 
Sepulveda Eastway to Pershing Drive. The highway is expected to cost at least 
$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Regulations 
</P>
<P>
Because the land is adjacent to LAX, building heights are restricted by the 
Federal Aviation Administration. On some parcels, only a one-story building can 
be constructed; on others, structures can be as high as 10 stories. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials said that average density will be 0.43 square feet of 
floor space per square foot of land. Under Proposition U, the slow-growth 
measure passed by Los Angeles voters in 1986, floor space up to 1 1/2 times the 
area of the land are permitted -- more than three times the density the airport 
is planning. 
</P>
<P>
What eventually is built on the land will depend on developer interest. 
Development guidelines call for much of the new construction to be devoted to 
be low-rise research and development buildings. 
</P>
<P>
They also call for the construction of hotel rooms, office buildings and 
restaurants. The property has been divided into 12 parcels, and plans call for 
the four smallest ones -- amounting to about eight acres -- to be left vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The department has excluded any large retail developments because they might 
hurt the already ailing downtown Westchester businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"You can sort of go down the list," said Marcellus, who grew up in Westchester. 
"Before, we had two movie houses on Sepulveda, now there are none. There was 
something like five grocery stores. Now there is one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait-and-See Attitude 
</P>
<P>
Local business leaders said the uncertainty about the vacant land has prompted 
nearby property owners to take a wait-and-see attitude toward their own land. 
Developer Drollinger, who said his mother built the first grocery store in 
Westchester in 1943, said he put off redeveloping some property until he had a 
better sense of what the airport was planning. 
</P>
<P>
Skip Petersen, owner of the Westchester Faire Antique Mall, said that although 
it was "pretty tough" making a go of it 10 years ago, business in the downtown 
area has improved. Several older buildings have been given face lifts, his own 
business is thriving, and the airport project can only help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that development would give us the shot in the arm we need to put us 
over the top," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemarie Ruddins, whose home of 13 years was condemned against her wishes, 
said she finds it ironic that it is all right to build a hotel on land where 
she was not allowed to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still very bitter about it," she said. "It was a land grab. It was a 
sham."

5 DISTRICTS FIGHT BUILDERS OVER SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Educators statewide are hoping five pugnacious Santa Clarita school districts 
win their court battle against California's powerful building industry, setting 
the stage for similar victories at home. 
</P>
<P>
School officials in other fast-growing regions say admiringly that the Santa 
Clarita districts -- William S. Hart, Newhall, Castaic, Saugus and Sulphur 
Springs -- are leading the state in the drive for construction money. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've heard, they are out front on this issue," said Dianne Jacob, 
past president of the California School Boards Assn. "They are out there 
punching and fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Millions of construction dollars are at stake to accommodate the rapid growth 
in Santa Clarita. The Santa Clarita districts have mushroomed by 4,000 students 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It strikes me that no one has been as aggressive," said Bill Ingram, current 
school board association president. The association, which counts 96% of the 
state's 1,025 school districts as members, is watching the Santa Clarita case 
closely. The five districts, he said, are unique. 
</P>
<P>
Besides tangling with the California Building Industry Assn., three of the 
Santa Clarita districts are waging other legal battles against the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors, also over school construction fees. Last week, the 
districts requested -- and got -- the support of the Santa Clarita City Council 
in their fight with the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
And over the weekend, executive officers of the school boards association met 
to discuss whether the group should join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of known as the mavericks up here," said Pat Willett, a Newhall 
district trustee. 
</P>
<P>
But Willett said that explosive growth in the Santa Clarita Valley and a lack 
of support from the supervisors have forced the districts to be tenacious. 
"There's not much point in sitting and wringing our hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
William M. Clark, assistant superintendent in the Saugus district, said the 
districts would rather devote energy to conditions in the classroom, not to 
building the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to be out of the litigation business," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The growth problems are formidable. Each of the five districts has recently 
built or is planning to build campuses. 
</P>
<P>
A school that opened in the Newhall district in September was just below 
capacity on the first day of class. This month, the Castaic district opened its 
second campus in 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions in the Saugus district summarize the trend. In the last 2 1/2 years, 
Clark said, the district has grown by 22% to 5,159 students. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Saugus officials opened a school made entirely of temporary 
classrooms. Designed to hold 330 students, the school now has 485. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Saugus School to Open 
</P>
<P>
In April the Saugus district is scheduled to open another school and begin 
construction of one more. A third school is on the drawing board. And the 
building may not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1994, we will have over 1,000 students who will still need housing," Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The crowding, which Willett blamed on unfettered development, prompted the five 
districts to launch an initiative to impose school construction fees on 
development. Santa Clarita voters overwhelmingly approved the measure on June 
7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The fees, which range from $5,439 to $6,300 a unit, are the subject of the 
fight between the Santa Clarita districts and the California Building Industry 
Assn. State law already requires developers to pay $1.53 for every square foot 
of residential development to support new schools. The Santa Clarita fees 
generally exceed the amount that would be paid under the state law. 
</P>
<P>
The builders sued the districts, claiming that the fees were unconstitutional. 
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge sided with the school districts in August, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
But last month the state Court of Appeal supported the builders. Santa Clarita 
voters, the court ruled, had no authority to impose the fees. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita districts are appealing the case to the state Supreme Court. 
"It's a courageous act," said Jacob, a trustee in the Jamul-Dulzura School 
District in San Diego County. "Whether they win or lose in court, they are 
raising this issue to a high level." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram, a trustee in the Paris Union High School District in Riverside County, 
said other school districts undoubtedly will launch similar construction-fee 
initiatives if the Santa Clarita districts prevail before the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
In a related battle, the Hart, Saugus and Newhall districts have filed suit 
against the Board of Supervisors, saying that county development guidelines 
prohibit the board from approving residential projects that will overburden the 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel De Witt W. Clinton has said the districts are misinterpreting 
county policy. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the court cases unresolved, the Santa Clarita districts have gained 
some money to build schools. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers have agreed to pay the voter-approved fees. The Newhall Land 
and Farming Co., for example, will pay the Hart district $6 million toward the 
construction of a high school.

UNOCAL MOVES TO BEGIN RELOCATING SAN PEDRO TANK FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Unocal's San Pedro tank farm -- which residents have been trying to shut down 
since an oil tanker exploded nearby in 1976 -- would be dismantled in less than 
five years under a proposal the company has made to the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan has not yet been approved by the city's Board of Harbor 
Commissioners, participants on all sides -- the oil company, the Harbor 
Department staff, community residents and Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores -- say they support it. 
</P>
<P>
And the commissioners have already approved the first step. At their meeting 
last week, they granted Unocal a demolition permit for one of the nine tanks at 
the site. Consideration of the full plan has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Victory for Residents 
</P>
<P>
The Unocal proposal represents a turnaround for both the company and the Harbor 
Department -- and a victory for area residents and Flores, who for years have 
been pushing for relocation of the 20-acre tank farm on 22nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that Unocal has made a commitment to move its facility 
based on the concerns of the neighborhood and the council office," said David 
Grannis, a company consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to run out and get myself a Unocal button," said an elated Beatrice 
Atwood Hunt, the community activist who has been the oil company's staunchest 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
Said Flores: "I think it is a major victory, because this could have gone on 
for years without a resolution." 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm, which can hold 2 million barrels of crude oil, serves as a way 
station for crude oil pumped from the Unocal tanker terminal, at the foot of 
Miner Street in San Pedro, to the company's refinery in Wilmington. Oil from 
the tankers is stored at the farm until it is needed at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
However, the giant oil tanks are a few hundred feet from a residential area and 
also are close to commercial developments along the West Channel of the harbor, 
most notably Cabrillo Marina. Even before the tanker Sansinena exploded at the 
Unocal terminal in 1976, killing nine men and causing $21.6 million in damage, 
residents like Hunt contended that the tanks were a hazard to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Department has had long-range plans to relocate the tank farm to a 
landfill island -- the so-called "energy island" it is planning to build in the 
outer harbor. But residents and Flores complained that such a relocation could 
take 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The matter came to a head this year when the company's lease with the Harbor 
Department for the 22nd Street site expired in July. Harbor officials and 
Unocal wanted to extend the lease for five years, but Flores said she would 
oppose such an extension unless it included a commitment to move the tanks 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
The result of those negotiations is an agreement that calls for the following: 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Department and Unocal will sign a "phase-out" lease that will 
require the company to demolish the tanks and clean up the site by July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The company will move the tanks -- possibly to land it owns near the Wilmington 
refinery -- and build a pipeline to pump oil directly from the San Pedro 
terminal to the new tanks. Flores said she and the residents will not oppose 
the pipeline plans. Her aide, Ann D'Amato, said the pipeline could run under 
Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
When the lease for the San Pedro terminal expires this summer, the Harbor 
Department will grant Unocal a 30-year extension, with the provision that if 
the energy island is completed after 20 years, the company could be forced to 
relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Win-Win' Situation 
</P>
<P>
Grannis, the Unocal consultant, said the move and the pipeline will cost the 
company $40 million. He characterized it as a "win-win" situation for Unocal, 
and said negotiations with the Harbor Department and Flores have "been a very 
cooperative process. It's not been a sledgehammer type situation at all." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who lives across the street from the tanks, credited Flores with 
pressuring the company to move the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the power of Joan Milke Flores," she said. ". . . And I think she was 
getting pretty darned upset with the port, so she just said come on, this is my 
district, it looks like heck, it's dangerous and I don't want that kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
As a councilwoman, Flores has no authority over port leases, but had she not 
gotten her way on the Unocal issue, she could have put pressure on the company 
by using city zoning laws. The Unocal tank farm site was recently rezoned for 
commercial uses, raising the question of whether the company could legally 
remain there.

DEPUTIES NOT SUSPECTED; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT FAILS TO SOLVE 1-YEAR-OLD MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Catherine Braley's body was found sprawled in a Van Nuys parking lot on 
Jan. 15, 1988, the case received only brief public mention by police and local 
newspapers. No one had any idea who killed her or why. 
</P>
<P>
But within a few months, the murder of the 26-year-old department store cashier 
became one of the year's most publicized cases in the San Fernando Valley, due 
almost solely to the notoriety of a lawsuit filed by Braley's mother. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accused three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of the slaying and 
asked for $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
A year later the murder remains unsolved, though Los Angeles police now say 
they believe they know who may have killed Braley. The lawsuit too remains 
unresolved. But two of the deputies have been dropped from the suit and police 
insist that no deputies are suspected in the case. 
</P>
<P>
What appears to be the only certainty after a year's time is that key questions 
about Braley's murder remain unanswered, and that legal wrangling as a result 
of the lawsuit seems to have received more attention than the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seems to be centered on policies and legal procedures more than the 
apprehension of the perpetrator," said Mary Postma, Braley's mother. "I'm still 
waiting for something to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, authorities contend, it may be more Postma's fault than it 
is theirs. After all, they say, Postma was the one who filed the lawsuit, which 
they believe has hindered their efforts to find the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Any time a civil suit opens police files to scrutiny, as Postma's has, critical 
details used to solve a case become less valuable, police complain. Information 
once believed known only to the killer -- and investigators -- can no longer be 
kept under wraps to help eliminate suspects or build cases. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, police on the Braley case have been forced by court order to 
turn over hundreds of pages of confidential reports to Postma. Other portions 
of the police investigation have been publicly detailed in depositions forced 
by the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
What is particularly troubling to police is that many details -- such as the 
type of weapon used to mutilate Braley's body and descriptions of her wounds -- 
are now accessible to the public as a result of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that the fiasco of that civil action has been detrimental to the 
investigation," said Cmdr. William Booth, spokesman for the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walked to Cocktail Lounge 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jan. 14, 1988, Catherine Braley finished work about 6 p.m. at the 
Fedco department store in Van Nuys and walked to a small cocktail lounge, The 
Hunter, a block away. The following account is based on information from police 
records, court records and interviews with Braley's friends at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
At the lounge, Braley drank with friends and a number of sheriff's deputies who 
had gone to the bar after the funeral of a fellow undercover deputy slain in a 
drug raid. One of the deputies she met was Robert Mallon, 37, who had been at 
The Hunter since early that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Braley left the bar intoxicated about 11 p.m., the same time as Mallon and two 
other deputies, Robert Waters and Mike Turner. Waters and Turner got in their 
cars and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
Braley and Mallon, who later said he'd had as many as 16 beers, gin drinks and 
bourbon cocktails, walked over to his county-owned undercover car parked near 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
The two engaged in consensual sex in the car, drove about a mile away to the 
8000 block of Langdon Avenue and began to have sex in the car again, Mallon 
said in a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward Braley said, "I've got to go," and got out of the car, Mallon 
said. He never saw her again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Braley's body was found in a parking lot in the 8100 block of 
Sepulveda Boulevard, about a block from where she had left Mallon's car. She 
had been beaten, tortured and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several days police investigated Mallon as well as a man who had 
lived with Braley in a small trailer in Van Nuys, according to both men. Police 
will not discuss where else the investigation took them. But no arrests were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Postma heard from her daughter's friends that Braley had left The 
Hunter with three sheriff's deputies. When no arrests were made after several 
weeks, Postma contacted an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
On March 29, Postma sued the three deputies in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, accusing them of killing Braley for refusing sex with them and then 
mutilating her body to confuse investigators. The suit alleges that the 
deputies violated Braley's civil rights and had acted under "color of law," or 
in their capacities as law officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Defendants Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Postma dropped Waters and Turner from the suit when it became clear through 
evidence gathered for the case that they went their separate ways after leaving 
the bar. All three deputies, who declined through an attorney to comment for 
this report, have said they had no involvement in Braley's death. 
</P>
<P>
In the months after the lawsuit was filed, Postma and her attorney, Stephen 
Yagman, squared off against the law enforcement establishment in a battle that 
has been less than polite. Yagman and police have traded insults and 
accusations. Postma has refused to allow detectives to interview her, leaving 
them little choice but to subpoena her for questioning by a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman spent much of 1988 gathering evidence to support the suit's remaining 
allegations against Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is expected to be held in late March on Mallon's request for a 
summary judgment to dismiss the suit. One of Mallon's attorneys, Douglas J. 
Collodel, said there is no evidence his client killed Braley or that he was on 
duty that night. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman said he believes the lawsuit will clear that hurdle because he has 
gathered enough evidence to show that Mallon was acting in an official capacity 
when he was with Braley. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Yagman maintains that Mallon's behavior -- having 16 drinks, 
engaging in sex with Braley in a county car and allowing her to walk away drunk 
-- at least contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
Mallon is "legally responsible for the death of Catherine Braley," Yagman said. 
"If he didn't physically kill her, he should not have permitted her" to leave 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate question the case is based on is, 'Do we want our police to 
behave like this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, police have repeatedly said that Mallon is not believed to have 
been responsible for Braley's death. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that can be said for certain is that no deputy is a suspect," 
said Booth of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although police refuse to say why they are convinced Mallon was not involved in 
the killing, the deputy's own deposition in the lawsuit detailed his repeated 
questioning by detectives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Questioning 
</P>
<P>
In a deposition Yagman took for the lawsuit, Mallon said he drove to a cabin he 
owned in Parker, Ariz., the day after he last saw Braley. The following day he 
was awakened by a park ranger who asked him to drive to a nearby ranger office 
because a drunken friend was there asking for him. 
</P>
<P>
The story was a ruse. When Mallon got to the office he was met by two Los 
Angeles detectives who questioned him about Braley's death. Mallon said the 
police later took his undercover car, which he had left at his Los Angeles-area 
home, and had it examined by evidence technicians. 
</P>
<P>
When he got the car back, Mallon saw fingerprint dust in it. He was questioned 
by detectives at least two more times, he said, and his wife and two teen-age 
children were interviewed as well. 
</P>
<P>
Police would not confirm Mallon's account of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman called the police investigation flawed, largely because detectives did 
not tape-record their first interview with Mallon, giving him a chance to 
possibly change his story later. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was significantly flawed," Yagman said. "They took extraordinary 
precautions when they went out there to talk to him. Then they blew it." 
</P>
<P>
Yagman said he has asked the Sheriff's Department to conduct an internal 
investigation of Mallon's activities the night he was with Braley. But he said 
he does not know whether the Sheriff's Department ordered an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition Yagman took from Mallon nine months after Braley's death, 
Mallon said he had not been questioned by his superiors about that night. 
Mallon's attorneys and sheriff's officials would not comment on whether there 
had been an internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
While the lawsuit has turned attention on the murder to Mallon and his 
activities with Braley, Los Angeles detectives appear to be quietly focusing 
their investigation on an unnamed suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence that points toward an identifiable person but there is 
not enough evidence to make an arrest or to file charges at this time," Booth 
said of the case last week. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to say whether that person is Braley's former roommate, Joey 
Polino, who last year told The Times he had been repeatedly questioned about 
the murder by detectives. Polino, 34, is now in a California prison following 
his conviction for a June 9, 1988, robbery. He said he had no involvement in 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Postma said she has no second thoughts about filing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it helped," she said. "It got information out about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Now, a year after her daughter's death, Postma finds herself at odds with the 
investigators responsible for finding the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Her quandary was evident when she recently spoke of a $1,500 reward fund that 
Braley's friends contributed to at The Hunter. When asked where someone should 
call to give information about Braley's death and possibly collect the reward, 
Postma was unsure how to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want them calling the police," she said. "I really don't know 
where they should call."

MAVERICK STAKES OUT TURF ON CAPITOL HILL; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CONGRESSMAN DANA ROHRABACHER SETS FORTH ON UPHILL CLIMB TO SENIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the new year began, the makings of a new maverick conservative arrived in 
the Capitol: Dana Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>
A former speech writer for President Reagan, Rohrabacher is ensconced in one of 
the safest GOP congressional districts in the country: the 42nd, which hugs the 
coast from Redondo Beach and Torrance to part of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This affords him job security and a certain confidence. It means that someday 
he is likely to have the seniority to be a real power broker on Capitol Hill, 
and makes him one of a handful of Republican freshmen being closely watched as 
he launches his career as the South Bay's newest congressman. 
</P>
<P>
During his first week in office after being sworn in Jan. 3, it was clear that 
Rohrabacher, 41, of Lomita, would be carving a special role for himself in the 
Republican Party's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher had barely taken possession of his new office when he delivered a 
fiery speech in Washington on a favorite topic: "freedom fighters" around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his interest in foreign affairs and his rhetorical flair, 
Rohrabacher was already being compared in Washington to another Orange County 
conservative, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Though Rohrabacher's political future looks bright, everyone has to start 
somewhere. Rohrabacher began his first week as the lowliest of freshmen, vying 
for the dregs of office space and jockeying for the bottom rung on House 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "You don't usually get your first choice around here ..." Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands) said of the biannual competition for House committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher got his first choice of committees: Science, Space and Technology, 
which he wanted because of the heavy concentration of high-tech and aerospace 
industries in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed that with freedom and technology America can win the 
world," Rohrabacher said enthusiastically, sitting behind the large oak desk in 
his new office. "This appointment will permit me to put that philosophy to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
But Rohrabacher got, as he put it, the "booby prize" for his second committee: 
the District of Columbia Committee. The panel is the last on most lists of 
members of Congress because the issues that are dealt with are difficult -- gay 
rights, AIDS, budget -- and there is no publicity payoff in their home 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lewis tried to console Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the value, really, was the Redskins tickets," Lewis joked. "But he 
said he didn't watch football." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rohrabacher put on a good front, talking about how he could use the 
committee to promote conservative ideas for rejuvenating inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
"One lesson I learned from Ronald Reagan is when you're handed a lemon, you 
make lemonade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most surprising thing you see and feel and hear is the partisanship of 
the House," said former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach), the six-term 
veteran who was Rohrabacher's predecessor. "No one understands that, even if 
they work down at the White House, until they become a member of the House and 
see it for themselves. It colors everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he was sworn in, Rohrabacher got a lesson in partisanship as the 
Democratic-controlled House picked its new leader. Minority Leader Bob Michel 
(R-Illinois) lost, inevitably, to Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas). 
</P>
<P>
The new congressman's second vote, on the same day, drove home the point that 
hardball partisan politics runs the House. It came when Rohrabacher was called 
back to the House floor by a code of bells and lights from the clock above his 
office door. 
</P>
<P>
He may as well have stayed where he was. In a straight party-line vote, the 
House easily adopted a rules change that would benefit the majority Democrats 
at the expense of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"This is called raw political power being exercised," said Rohrabacher as he 
dashed across Independence Avenue while afternoon clouds gathered over chilly 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Still, let it be noted that the rookie was able to preserve, at least for a 
day, a 100% voting record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you're sworn into the Congress of the United States," said former Rep. 
Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), who retired from the 40th District, "you're 
treated like a different person." 
</P>
<P>
 One day last year, at about this time, Rohrabacher decided he would run for 
Congress in the district being vacated by Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
For him, the good news is he succeeded. The bad news is he has not received a 
paycheck since. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used up every bit of savings I ever had," Rohrabacher said. "That's part 
of the sacrifice you have to make to go into public office, unless you're 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
But better times are ahead. The new congressman's first paycheck is due Feb. 1, 
and, in a stroke of luck, President Reagan has recommended that the base pay 
for Congress be raised to $135,000 from $89,000 in February. This will take 
effect unless Congress votes it down. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the famous congressional perks now available to Rohrabacher. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are free membership in the congressional gym, street parking 
privileges any place in Washington (except in front of fire hydrants) and lots 
of "fact-finding" trips to pleasant places. And with the congressional franking 
privilege, his signature on the upper right-hand corner of an envelope has a 
monetary value: it is as good as a stamp. 
</P>
<P>
On a less tangible level, there is the deference accorded to members of 
Congress anywhere they go in Washington, from restaurant waiters to taxi 
drivers to police officers, who will change a traffic signal on Independence 
Avenue to speed lawmakers' dashes to the floor for votes and quorum calls. 
</P>
<P>
There is also that thrill -- surely it lasts longer than the first week -- of 
being addressed -- finally -- as "Congressman Rohrabacher." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "Seniority ... is important in Washington," said Rep. Ron C. Packard 
(R-Carlsbad), whose district includes portions of Orange County. "You have to 
wait your time and wait your turn." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of his first official acts in Washington, Rohrabacher joined in a game 
played every two years in Washington: the office lottery. 
</P>
<P>
He drew numbers along with the other 30 congressional freshman members who were 
vying for the dregs of offices, ones so remote or cramped that they were 
rejected by the other nearly 400 members of the 101st Congress. His lottery 
number: 20. 
</P>
<P>
From what was left after 19 freshmen chose their digs, Rohrabacher set up shop 
in the Longworth House Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a little disheveled at the moment," Rohrabacher said, surveying his 
desk, which sat amid a tangle of unconnected telephone wires and unopened boxes 
of supplies, "but it's no worse than my bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
He is, luckily, on the first floor; Longworth elevators are famous for long 
waits, and voting records depend on the alacrity with which members can get to 
the chamber after bells signal the 15-minute warning. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rohrabacher is not pleased. His view is paltry, looking up toward a huge 
urn-like fixture on C Street. And, he complained as he struggled to close his 
inner office door over a burp in the carpeting, his work space is too small. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher instructed his chief of staff, Richard T. Dykema, to put his name 
on the list for an office vacated by Rep. Bill Nichols (D-Alabama), who died 
after the November election. While Rohrabacher has virtually no hope of getting 
the office, which is in the coveted Rayburn House Office Building, the maneuver 
will enter him in the jockeying for other offices and should net him a bigger 
and better space in due time. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, even before his office was repainted, Rohrabacher had hung a 
couple of mementos on the nails left from the previous occupant's pictures and 
plaques. The first to go up, of course, was a picture of Rohrabacher's hero and 
former boss, Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
To brighten his view, Rohrabacher had placed on the window sill two sculptures: 
a small Statue of Liberty and a ceramic of the late actor John Wayne, whom 
Rohrabacher knew through Orange County Republican circles. Wayne's statue, 
Rohrabacher said, projects the "solid conservative image" he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, Wayne taught him how to drink tequila: on the rocks with a 
twist of lime. 
</P>
<P>
"Something I finally had to learn: you can't do everything you want in 
Congress," Rep. Lungren said. "You have to learn to be selective on issues 
you're going to go 100% for." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher's first act after being elected congressman was to slip into Burma 
without that country's permission and deliver an impassioned speech to that 
strife-worn country's "freedom fighters." 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent from Rohrabacher's first week in office that he would be 
focusing on such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after he was sworn in, Rohrabacher delivered an ardent speech to the 
United Forum for Democracy and Human Rights in Burma. "People are fighting for 
freedom in the far corners of the planet and it is the tyrants and oppressors 
who are in retreat," Rohrabacher said in his talk. "The people of Burma are 
part of this great historic advance of human freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in his office, Rohrabacher said he took a particular pleasure in being 
able to say things on his own that he could not get into the speeches he wrote 
for President Reagan. One of them: "and smug little tyrants with blood on their 
hands spouted off Marxist slogans to justify their oppression . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be able to use phrases like that," Rohrabacher said, 
obviously enjoying the new-found independence of being a member of Congress. 
"And I'm the final approver of the copy."

A tailgating incident erupted into violence on the Antelope Valley Freeway 
Friday night when a Santa Clarita man allegedly shot at another motorist, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
William McLaughlin, 19, was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly

Chiaramonte's truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
When Chiaramonte applied his brakes, McLaughlin pulled in front, braked sharply 
and allegedly shot at Chiaramonte, Roberts said.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: MARTIN LUTHER KING'S DREAM THRIVING AT INGLEWOOD HIGH 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I went to Inglewood High School last week looking for a Martin Luther King Day 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 I found three: Carmen Barbee, Loan Dao and Norland Tellez. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming, talented kids who give off sparks of energy and intelligence as they 
talk about school, themselves and race relations 21 years after King's 
assassination. They are dreamers from cultures that have lived nightmares. They 
are the pride of a proud city that embodies the multi-ethnic American 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
All three won first place in this year's school district contest on the King 
day theme of freedom and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Loan, who is Vietnamese, won the speech contest and will give her speech on 
King's legacy Monday at the holiday ceremony at First Church of God in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen, who is black, won first place in the written essay competition. 
</P>
<P>
Norland, who is Nicaraguan, won the poster competition for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"In the first version of my speech, I said it was a myth that racism doesn't 
exist any more, that Dr. King had erased everything," Loan Dao says. "A cruel 
myth." 
</P>
<P>
She is an 18-year-old with a soft accent and a poetic air. A determined 
contender for valedictorian, she enjoys public speaking. She is nervous, she 
says, until she takes the microphone, then "the trepidations go away." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents want Loan to be a dermatologist. Her teachers encourage her dreams 
of becoming a writer or a journalist. She says she writes "vignettes" about 
memories of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in the country near a little lake. When I was 8 years old, I would 
wake up and go out by myself about 3 o'clock in the morning and fish. It was 
kind of strange for an 8-year-old girl. I set up the net at night to catch 
fish. In the morning I would come out at dawn and gather up the net before I 
went to school." 
</P>
<P>
Loan does not have memories of combat because she lived near Long Xuyen, an 
area that remained largely peaceful. But she remembers the post-war 
oppressiveness of rationing and long lines, an atmosphere in which "they 
control your every move." 
</P>
<P>
Her family came to the United States eight years ago. They were teachers in 
Vietnam. They own a nail salon in Watts, where Loan has worked part time. 
</P>
<P>
She talks frankly about racial prejudice in the United States in all its forms, 
including anti-Asian taunts at school. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really emotional about this," she says. "I don't think it's just whites 
against blacks, it's every race. My race too, we discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Wiley, Inglewood schools counseling director and an organizer of the 
King Day festivities, said the contest judges were extremely impressed by 
Loan's speech. But she was asked to rework it to focus more on the theme: how 
Martin Luther King's achievements created opportunities, rather than her 
personal perspective on racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a passionate challenge to the mostly black judges from an Asian, 
a minority in a predominantly black and Latino city. 
</P>
<P>
Lao began the revised speech by saying teachers and friends liked her speech, 
but told her she would not win because she is not black: 
</P>
<P>
"They said it wouldn't be right for a Vietnamese leading a commemoration of 
Martin Luther King, a black man. I was appalled and I was hurt. Didn't Martin 
Luther King fight and give his life to get rid of this racial discrimination?" 
</P>
<P>
The prize-winning speech goes on to laud King and describe how Loan feels she 
is part of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
She concludes: "Until America faces this bleak problem of race and color, it is 
ill-prepared to help other nations achieve freedom. Until America seeks an 
answer to its racial problem, it will never be a true democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Of the award she was told she wouldn't get, Loan said: "It warms my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Barbee's parents are from Tennessee. She remembers her mother telling 
her what it was like to work as a maid, how she had to enter her employer's 
house through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old junior says she did not need to do much research when she got 
the English class assignment on this year's Martin Luther King day theme: "I am 
Free to become." 
</P>
<P>
King's legacy "is embedded in you from when you're little," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen came to Inglewood from Compton, parts of which she cheerfully describes 
as a "war zone." Carmen talks exuberantly about Shakespeare, Euripides and her 
"close relationship with Jesus Christ." She directs the choir at the Compton 
Wilderness Table Apostolic Church. She has no doubt about where she will go to 
college: Oral Roberts University. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good in science and math and it's good in theology too," she says. "Other 
Christian colleges don't have that." 
</P>
<P>
Her career ambitions are less definite. 
</P>
<P>
"I love everything," she says. "When I'm in science class I want to be an 
engineer. When I'm in drama class, I want to be an actress." 
</P>
<P>
English teacher Dan Haefele calls Carmen one of his better writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish more people could do the things she can do," he says. "She has 
well-planned thoughts that she expresses quite clearly. She's prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen wasn't prepared for the news she had won first place. She says she wrote 
the essay and forgot about it. 
</P>
<P>
The essay reads in part: "While all of Dr. King's legacy is a benefit to my 
life both physically and mentally, I find one aspect of it the greatest: to 
love. Dr. King stressed peace toward all men through love. Love others whether 
you are loved by them or not. A prize too worthy on which to put a prize, love 
will help me in life always." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment reflects her religious convictions. She says she is affected by 
the exploration of evil in literature, like the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. She 
thinks highly of such works, but tries to keep them at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a part of a person drawn to things like that," she says. "It 
was kind of brutal. It gave me nightmares. I don't read a lot of stuff like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
As for race relations, she says there is always need for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there are people, they're going to have prejudices. It's up to the 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
Norland Tellez remembers sitting 10 years ago in a neighbor's well-fortified 
home in a middle-class neighborhood of Managua, Nicaragua, listening to the 
guns and bombs of the approaching revolution. He was about 7. He thought the 
pyrotechnics display was neat. 
</P>
<P>
In the three years since leaving Nicaragua, Norland has made a name for himself 
at Inglewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
"The revolution looked OK at first," he says. "We (his family) disagreed in 
some things." 
</P>
<P>
After years of rationing, economic hardship and some political tension, his 
family joined a growing stream of emigrants. Rather than feeling anger toward 
the Sandinista revolution, he says his family feels "disappointment" about 
Nicaragua's frustrated hopes and promises. 
</P>
<P>
Norland's father is a painter and photographer who worked in advertising and 
for Nicaragua's major newspapers. Norland, as well as his younger brothers 
Yorland and Carlos, have been painting and drawing since they were very young. 
All three won recognition in this year's King-day art competition -- just as 
they have in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Norland "has to rank as one of the best if not the best student I've had," says 
graphic arts teacher Clifford Johnson. "Based on raw talent, creativity, the 
neatness of his work, his thought and energy." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow students know Norland as a Michelangelo of classroom doodles. He is 
known for his caricatures of teachers; while generally well-received, they 
occasionally have chilled relations with their subjects, he says. He is drawing 
caricatures of popular teachers for the yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
"In Nicaragua, people recognized I could draw," he says. "But they never made a 
big deal of it like they have here." 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of a teacher, Norland studied animation in a summer arts program 
last year. He has decided he wants to study at California Institute of the Arts 
in Valencia, a school whose students often get hired as animators for Walt 
Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"I take it very seriously," says Norland, who also plays varsity tennis. 
</P>
<P>
His prize-winning poster this year features two powerful hands breaking their 
chains while a crowd surges in front of Martin Luther King. The poster evokes 
heroic Latin American popular art which is seen in the new Nicaragua. Norland 
acknowledges such works may have had a formative influence. 
</P>
<P>
But above all, the relentlessly enthusiastic youth is grateful for the 
opportunities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had any problems with anyone," he says. "King's legacy gave me the 
opportunity to go as far as I want to go."

BEVERLY HILLS VOTE RINGS IN REPRIEVE FOR PROPOSED GLOCKENSPIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Beverly Hills developer Moses Lerner last summer proposed a European-style 
glockenspiel facing the courtyard of his new three-story shopping center on 
North Canon Drive, he thought the idea would get a quick approval from the 
culture-conscious city that calls itself the "new Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
The device, costing $100,000, would be the first glockenspiel in the Western 
United States, according to Lerner. This glockenspiel is not a musical 
instrument but like the famous glockenspiels in Munich, Prague and Venice, 
would feature brightly colored ceramic figures rotating on moving tracks at 
specified hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Its theme would be American culture. Recognizing the impact of film on American 
life, the glockenspiel would include a 2-foot-tall ceramic projectionist 
holding a working video camera aimed at shoppers, who could view themselves on 
television screens facing the courtyard. Other figures, also two feet tall, 
might include an actress dancing, a cowboy with a lasso, a Civil War soldier, 
an aviator and a car mogul. Their performances would also be filmed by the 
model projectionist and appear on the TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
Different musical themes would accompany the performances, which could be 
changed from time to time to reflect different aspects of American culture. 
There would be two identical performances each day -- one at lunchtime and one 
during the cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered a Sign 
</P>
<P>
But what Lerner considers a work of art, the city Planning Commission considers 
a sign. Last November, the commission determined that the glockenspiel would 
violate the city's strict prohibitions against moving or rotating signs. The 
point of the glockenspiel was not to add culture to Beverly Hills, but to 
attract customers, the commissioners reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner, however, insisted the glockenspiel would contain no advertising and 
would not represent any product. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner's project got a reprieve Tuesday when the City Council voted 4-to-1 that 
the glockenspiel did not fall within the sign ordinance's broad definition of 
"sign," which includes "any . . . figure . . . spectacle, display, appliance . 
. . or any other thing of a similar nature designed to attract attention 
outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were not convinced by the planners' argument that the 
main purpose of the glockenspiel was to attract attention from customers. If 
that had been the case, they said, Lerner would have built the glockenspiel on 
the outside of the building rather than inside facing the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The glockenspiel's design must still be approved by the city's Architectural 
Review Commission, which is expected to consider the matter in mid-February. 
The glockenspiel would be housed on the second floor of the nearly completed 
"Village on Canon," 301 N. Canon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting their case to the council, planners noted that the city several 
years ago denied a permit for a rotating statue of John Wayne on horseback at 
the southeast corner of La Cienega and Wilshire boulevards. A non-rotating 
version of the statue was erected instead because motorists might have been 
distracted by the moving figure. But council members countered that Lerner's 
glockenspiel would not be visible to motorists or to anyone else who is not in 
the building's courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Flood of Signs 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission Chairwoman MeraLee Goldman said Beverly Hills prides itself 
on its tough sign ordinance and approving Lerner's glockenspiel could cause 
other businesses to claim that they, too, need moving signs to compete with the 
glockenspiel. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're dealing with here is not one structure," Goldman told council 
members. "What we're dealing with here is opening Pandora's box. What we're 
dealing with is Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a glockenspiel. I think what's sitting in Munich is a 
glockenspiel. I think what's in Prague is a glockenspiel. . . . We do not want 
moving, flashing things anywhere in this city." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Robert Tanenbaum took issue with that argument. "The precedential 
value of (the glockenspiel) would have the impact of a feather because of its 
uniqueness," Tanenbaum said. "It's just not a sign." 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Maxwell Salter quipped: "It's much ado about nothing, and, as I say, 
I'd rather see a glockenspiel than be one." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Allan L. Alexander, who was the only council member to vote against 
the glockenspiel, said the sign ordinance should be rewritten to allow moving 
signs only on the insides of buildings, where they attract less attention. 
</P>
<P>
By agreeing that the glockenspiel is not a sign according to the city's 
definition, the council avoided deciding whether to grant Lerner a variance to 
the sign ordinance. Instead, council members on Feb. 7 will vote on a 
resolution stating their belief that the glockenspiel is more than a sign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a work of art," Salter said.

LANDMARK SIGN WILL LIVE TO FLASH ANOTHER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gus's Bar-B-Q sign in South Pasadena will stay, even though the building 
it's attached to has to go. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old sign at 808 Fair Oaks Ave. has been around so long it has 
achieved historic landmark status worthy of preservation, the South Pasadena 
City Council agreed last month after hearing a public clamor to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Gus's Barbecue itself, which is in a building so badly damaged by the 
Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake that it will be demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
The old-fashioned flashing, animated sign, which was referred to as "an art 
form impossible to reproduce today" and "the highest expression of the American 
Dream" at last month's council meeting, was the biggest issue for the overflow 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It was granted what amounts to eternal life by officials in a city known for 
its tenacious grip on small-town values in the face of development proposals 
and a freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 of Gus's boosters, including descendants of the original owners 
and a waitress who worked there 43 years, packed City Hall to appeal a Planning 
Commission decision to prohibit the sign. The commission ruled in November that 
it violates several provisions of a new ordinance that will go into effect June 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Gus's, a small restaurant started by three Greek immigrant brothers in the 
1940s, has been closed for a year and a half while a second generation of 
owners has pondered its fate. Peter Tripodes and Dino Lappas recently decided 
to rebuild on the same site and to pattern the new restaurant after the old, 
designing the front specifically to show off the landmark sign. 
</P>
<P>
It protrudes higher than the rooftop of its current building, and so it will 
over the new building. It is animated, with multicolored little pigs and 
chickens flickering around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
The new law prohibits signs that extend above a building. It also forbids 
animation and flashing lights. Although it does not specifically prohibit neon, 
it was intended to control the whirling buckets and glaring arches of fast-food 
eateries that burgeoned a decade ago, Mayor James Woolacott said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has asked the Planning Commission to consider a provision in the 
sign ordinance that would protect signs of historic significance. Signs like 
the one on the Rialto Theater a block away are already protected because the 
structure is a historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Edward Bilezikjian said the new building was designed to integrate 
the sign. "Our concept is the sign is part of the building, not something 
that's attached," he said. Calling it "a fixture in the community and a 
significant landmark," he said it will help the owners get back in business 
after their long absence. Construction is expected to begin in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lappas and Tripodes appealed the Planning Commission decision to the council 
and circulated flyers asking for community support at last month's meeting. 
Fans of the sign came to the meeting and told the council they thought it was 
"charming," "delightful," "whimsical," "significant and historic." 
</P>
<P>
Lili Lakich, director of the Museum of Neon Art in Los Angeles, said Gus's sign 
is one of the best of its kind remaining in the Los Angeles area. He said it is 
"symbolic of the American spirit and an element of urban vitality." 
</P>
<P>
Amedee Richards, spokesman for the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation, said 
that keeping the sign "is important to the charm and character of our town." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joseph Crosby said, "I look at this as motherhood and apple pie and 
part of what makes our town unique." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Samuel Knowles asked for the sign's approval "for as long as Gus's 
is in use as a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
"That means forever," Tripodes told well-wishers after the meeting.

'GAMES . . . ARE AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO UNDERSTANDING REALITY.';

<P>
A CHRONICLE OF CHILDREN AT PLAY DURING HORROR OF THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC WILHELMUS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stripped of their innocence at an early age, Jewish children who were held 
prisoner in concentration camps and relocated to ghettos during World War II 
spent their few idle moments playing "Gas Chamber," "Gestapo Agent" and other 
games that reflected the horror of their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than play games that would help them escape their misery, these 
children, ages 2 to 14, often played games that mirrored their surroundings, 
said George Eisen, a Cal Poly Pomona physical education professor. He has 
written "Children and Play in the Holocaust," published by the University of 
Massachusetts Press. 
</P>
<P>
The book describes games played by Jewish children who lived in concentration 
camps, ghettos and in hiding during Germany's occupation of Europe. The Nazis 
systematically exterminated 6 million Jews, an estimated 1 million of them 
children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imitate the Screams 
</P>
<P>
Eisen found that in Auschwitz, children played "Gas Chamber," during which they 
would imitate the screams of the people they heard being gassed to death. 
</P>
<P>
In "Burial," they mimicked the mass burials conducted by the Germans. A few 
children would lie down and play dead, and others would roll them into shallow 
graves. In one variation of the game, a child pretended to be a dead Adolph 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Other games included "Doctor," in which a child would take food rations away 
from children pretending to be sick and refuse to help them without a bribe, 
and "Blockade," in which the children reenacted being sealed off from their 
families by German forces. 
</P>
<P>
The children also played "Blowing Up Bunkers," "Slaughter," and "Seizing the 
Clothes of the Dead." 
</P>
<P>
"Games in any culture are an important means to understanding reality," said 
Eisen, a Jewish native of Hungary whose field of study concerns the sociology 
of sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Playacting came to provide a naturally reflective mirror of all the sorrows, 
dismay and absurdity of the children's brief existence," Eisen says in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"This transcends the Holocaust," he said. "Mass exterminations have occurred in 
Beirut, Lebanon, Cambodia and Ireland. Where playing reflects the surroundings, 
where children have been traumatized, it means they will be traumatized in 
adult life as well." 
</P>
<P>
Eisen, who as a youth spent a year in hiding with his Jewish mother while his 
father was held prisoner in a concentration camp, said the children didn't 
necessarily play to have fun. Rather, they may have been imitating what they 
saw in an attempt to understand and cope with the atrocities surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
As their living conditions worsened and the children saw the murder of hundreds 
of their friends, relatives and acquaintances, the games increasingly became 
anti-German. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often it was hard to recruit a group of children willing to play the 
hated enemy, the German soldiers," writes Eisen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recurring Nightmares 
</P>
<P>
The repercussions of these games followed the children into adulthood, Eisen 
said. "They didn't necessarily go back to playing regular games after the war, 
and many had recurring nightmares and major emotional problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous source in the book says that because of her experiences in two 
concentration camps, "I don't even feel I know how to play and I found that 
it's a very big lack with my own children." 
</P>
<P>
Eisen said that although adults in the ghettos participated in sports such as 
volleyball and track, they played for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
"The major difference between adults and children was that adults used games 
for escapist reasons," he said. "Adults have the power to rationalize their 
actions; children don't." 
</P>
<P>
Eisen was born in German-occupied Hungary in 1943. He has taught in Cal Poly 
Pomona's physical education department since 1979. He attended high school in 
Hungary, college in Israel and received a doctorate from the University of 
Maryland. While in Israel, he enlisted in the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
He got the idea for this book while researching organized Jewish sports in 
pre-World War 11 Europe for his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
While working on his dissertation in 1979 on the social and political aspects 
of sports in Europe, Eisen came upon the diary of a Jewish ghetto resident. It 
questioned how the Jews could play games while they were being systematically 
exterminated. 
</P>
<P>
He mentally filed the topic away, and later spent three years traveling to 
Israel and Europe, visiting concentration camps and looking through archival 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Eisen said he was fascinated by the "coexistence of games and sport and mass 
murder, the ability of the Jews to maintain life amidst death."

DEMOCRAT LEADER VIEWS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, Mr. Thomas A. Fuentes says we Orange County Democrats are "sad and 
ineffective" (Jan. 10). We certainly are not sad, and we are always trying to 
become more effective. What is sad, however, is the arrogance of the Orange 
County Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes and the rest of that leadership did a very bad thing by hiring guards 
to discourage Hispanics from voting. That act has been condemned by people of 
conscience in both parties. Only the Republican leadership of Orange County has 
failed to condemn it. And now, by the reelection of Fuentes as their chairman, 
they have ratified and approved this wrong and unconstitutional act. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Democratic Party opens its doors to Republicans, Hispanics, 
and others, who are disgusted by the Orange County Republican leadership's 
disrespect for our constitutional freedoms.

BRIBERY AFFAIR TURNS UP NEWPORT HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Countians have a renewed confidence in the strength of their American 
democracy and Newport Beach citizens have a new hero in their midst with the 
story (Jan. 5) of the courageous service provided by Newport's Planning 
Commission chairman, Buzz Person, in derailing the attempt by a local 
restaurant owner to subvert the democratic process of our government through 
bribery. Such undercover corruption gnaws at the very vitals of American 
democracy. But to know we have a public servant with guts and integrity who 
could call this illegal and unpatriotic attempt on its own ground, gives us all 
hope and new faith in America. 
</P>
<P>
Newporters have reason to be proud of their community, and we all have a new 
hero -- Buzz Person! 
</P>
<P>
If there is a cloud in the affair, it is the tap-on-the-wrist sentence on the 
perpetrator by Judge Margaret Anderson. If a judge does not understand any 
better the threat to America that lack of integrity in government brings, then 
she should get off the bench.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER IRVINE RIGHTS ORDINANCE

In response to Irvine Mayor Larry Agran's comments regarding the letter mailed 
to Republican officeholders asking for their help in denouncing the recent 
anti-discrimination ordinance: I challenge his belief that it is demagoguery. 
</P>
<P>
One has only to read the newspaper to know that homosexuality is not limited to 
consenting adults. What about "cruising" for young men, to say nothing of 
molesting little boys? The council cannot legislate the acceptance of sodomy. 
Do we want Irvine to become the West Hollywood of Orange County?

We were saddened not only because we know of the sorrow of the family and 
friends, but because the circumstances might have been prevented had a jury 
voted to find the Costa Mesa police guilty in their pursuit of Ruben Valle on 
Dec. 12, 1984. We believe that the "not guilty" decision gave a green light to 
Orange County law enforcement that hot pursuits will be condoned or even 
encouraged at the expense of an innocent public. 
</P>
<P>
It was our son and brother, along with Billy Dearing, who lost their lives as 
innocent victims Dec. 12, 1984. We were outraged then and are outraged now that 
hot pursuits still claim the lives of the innocent. Although police departments 
have "guidelines," guidelines are not law and don't have to be followed. We 
tried to bring this macho law enforcement attitude to the public's attention 
through our lawsuit, and it was an uphill battle for the better part of 3 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It is our hope and prayer that one day law enforcement will have to be 
accountable for acts of irresponsibility in the line of duty.

A CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 125 registered voters applied for the Orange County Grand Jury last year. 
In 1987, about 1,700 letters sent to the community and elected officials 
initially drew only 60 applications. The response is even less so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
So the grand jury isn't for everyone. Still, it means everything to me. 
</P>
<P>
Instant gratification may not be an asset of grand jury service, but it's easy 
enough to apply. All a candidate has to be is over 18, a yearlong county and 
state resident and English speaking. 
</P>
<P>
It helps if he/she has ordinary intelligence and sound judgment and is willing 
to submit to detailed investigation by the district attorney's office. A 
cross-section of jurors is being sought before the deadline of 5 p.m. Friday. 
There has been a preponderance of applicants from affluent south county. It has 
been suggested that more Orange County businessmen hold jobs open and continue 
to pay employees who opt for public service for a year, but that may be a 
Utopian dream. 
</P>
<P>
What would be more realistic would be internships for public administration and 
political science majors as well as law students. In addition to this type of 
on-the-job training, there could be more subsidization of wives by working 
husbands and vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
One satisfactory solution has been school district employees choosing to spend 
their sabbaticals studying local government. 
</P>
<P>
Grand jury can be life in the fast lane. Trying to make a difference is what 
it's all about.

THE CONTROVERSY OVER IRVINE RIGHTS ORDINANCE

Regarding the fight of four lawmakers against the Irvine ordinance on gay 
rights: Gay people do not choose their sexual orientation any more than 
heterosexuals choose theirs; it just develops. The only thing they can choose 
is to be honest and open about it, which takes great courage in our society. If 
the lawmakers' constituents understood that, perhaps some of them would not 
vote for such loudmouth, un-Christian bigot-demagogues as Reps. Dannemeyer and 
Dornan and such gutless, me-too political mediocrities as Assemblymen Ferguson

THOUGHTS ON EASING PAIN OF HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Year's Day. Not quite dawn. The smell of wet clothes, sound of coughing, 
mumbling, snoring. I felt embarrassed, like an intruder, and found myself 
talking in whispers and walking softly. After all, it is their bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Armory was an eerie, cavernous hall, full of "the homeless" -- 
restless, sleeping forms sprawled on narrow, foldaway cots such as one takes to 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
There were more than 100 people, six rows of cots, about 20 in a row; although 
the light was too dim for counting, it was too bright for sleeping, when Karin 
Johnson, Wally Walchak and I walked in to serve breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The two rows on the left were for women and children, the other four for men. 
There was a young family toward the front with two kids, about 3 and 3, and a 
3-month-old baby. A heart-wrenching tableau. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Johnson, who organized the Fullerton group, had spoken one Sunday at 
our Unitarian-Universalist Church and asked for volunteers, so we three, an 
advance group for a later, fuller contingent, learned the routine. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m., the people were awakened. Many had jobs they must get to. They had 
to fold their blankets and put away their beds before breakfast. A little boy 
was pulling on wet, dirty socks; I went over to the pile of donated clothes but 
found no little boy socks, so he wore his wet ones. 
</P>
<P>
We hurried to get the juice (not enough for all, although I saved some for the 
kids), cereal, milk (a plastic cupful only if you are a child or pregnant), an 
abundance of coffee and a large box of doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
The people were sweet, gentle and smiled at us and said, "Thank you." Some 
wished us a happy new year. 
</P>
<P>
It was a soul-stirring experience. 
</P>
<P>
It was mindful to some of Depression days. 
</P>
<P>
I called the others of our church, the Armory volunteers, to tell them to be 
ready for Jan. 4. All were eager to help, but the Interfaith Emergency group 
called and said the armory would not be available; it was "being used for 
training exercises." 
</P>
<P>
We will reschedule for the 15th, and if the exercises are over, we'll be there 
with the Unitarians and the Catholics and the Jews and the Protestants in one 
loving amalgamation to ease the pain of "The Homeless."

KENTUCKY WAITING FOR OTHER SNEAKER TO DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Osburn of Redondo Beach, Calif., punched in at the Emery Worldwide air 
freight warehouse in Los Angeles at his usual time, 5:30 a.m., last March 31. 
As a "territory representative" for Emery, Osburn's first order of business 
that dawn was to sort packages that he and other Emery workers would later 
deliver in the Los Angeles area. Known as "picking," the job requires opening 
crates full of packages and sorting the packages by address and zip code. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of March 31, Osburn was going through crates that had arrived 
from Emery's Dayton, Ohio, hub when, he said, he found a package with its flap 
open, exposing the package's contents. "I saw a videotape saying Kentucky 
versus some other university," Osburn would state later in a deposition, "and I 
saw some bills behind up in the sleeve of the videotape. It was Kentucky versus 
something at some dome of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
The addressee was Claud Mills, the father of Los Angeles high school basketball 
star and University of Kentucky recruit Chris Mills. The return address bore 
the name of Dwane Casey, an assistant basketball coach at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The cash, tucked neatly between the videotape and the cardboard sleeve, was 
$1,000 in crisp, new $50 bills. 
</P>
<P>
Osburn's discovery became hot gossip among Emery employees, one of whom, a 
forklift driver named John Zaverl, had a brother-in-law working as a clerk at 
the Los Angeles Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the saga of Emery air waybill No. 043365177 was reported by 
the Daily News, touching off an NCAA investigation that, Kentucky basketball 
being Kentucky basketball, has shaken the Bluegrass State to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
The school is currently preparing a response to 18 allegations lodged by the 
NCAA, the most prominent being that Casey sent $1,000 to Claud Mills. Among the 
others are charges that Casey offered another recruit cash and cars, that a 
Kentucky player -- sophomore swingman Eric Manuel -- committed academic fraud 
and that Casey lied to NCAA investigators. Casey and Mills have denied the 
allegations. Manuel has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has already cost the school an athletic director (Cliff 
Hagan) and, for this season at least, a star player (Manuel). When it is 
completed -- next April at the earliest -- it could result in bans on 
postseason play and television appearances for the Wildcats and cuts in the 
number of scholarships they can award. The NCAA could rule Manuel and Mills, 
now in his freshman season, ineligible and force the university to take action 
against Casey. And while head Coach Eddie Sutton has not been directly 
implicated, he could lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
School officials emphasize that none of the charges has been proven, that the 
case must be heard by the NCAA's Committee on Infractions. Still, a huge shadow 
has been cast on the college basketball program with perhaps the richest 
tradition and most passionate following in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never a day that I don't wake up and think about what's going on and 
what might happen," said Sean Sutton, the coach's son and the Wildcats' 
sophomore point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Kentuckians' feelings were gauged recently in a poll conducted by The Cats' 
Pause, a weekly newspaper devoted to Kentucky sports. More then 600 of the 
paper's subscribers responded to the survey, and their comments were spread 
across 12 pages of the Dec. 10 issue. Among the findings: Nearly 57 percent 
said university President David Roselle should remove Sutton and his staff if 
the school is found guilty of violating NCAA rules, and nearly 97 percent said 
the integrity of the Kentucky athletics program has been damaged by the NCAA 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that his readers tend to be Kentucky's most zealous supporters, Oscar 
Combs, editor and publisher of The Cats' Pause, said, "When you get 96.9 of 
these readers to say the integrity of UK and the program have been damaged, 
it's got to be bad. You would expect 10 or 15 percent of these people to 
stonewall it through hell." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mills allegation, the NCAA has charged that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Casey made improper recruiting inducements in 1986 and '87 to Sean Higgins, 
a teammate of Mills' at Los Angeles' Fairfax High School, including offers of a 
monthly allowance of $300 starting when Higgins signed a Kentucky letter of 
intent, a car upon signing and the opportunity to get a different car upon 
enrolling at Kentucky. Higgins signed with UCLA but enrolled at Michigan last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manuel committed academic fraud in 1987 and the university violated NCAA 
rules in certifying his eligibility. Those allegations come from questions 
surrounding a dramatic improvement in Manuel's scores on college entrance exams 
last year. Manuel, Kentucky's only returning starter, is sitting out practices 
and games this year until the matter is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has also asked the university to provide information about "unusual" 
cash payments made by the relative of a recruit soon after the relative 
received parcels via Emery from a member of the Kentucky basketball staff. 
According to published reports, the relative is the mother of Shawn Kemp of 
Elkhart, Ind., the 6-11 prize of the Wildcats' '88 recruiting class, and the 
staff member is Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kemp did not meet Proposition 48 eligibility requirements, he enrolled 
at Kentucky. But he departed for a junior college, Trinity Valley Community 
College in Athens, Texas, the first week in November, shortly after it was 
disclosed that he had pawned two gold chains that Sean Sutton had reported 
missing from his dormitory room. Sean Sutton declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Without Manuel, Kemp and Rex Chapman, who moved on to the NBA after two college 
seasons, Kentucky has seen the makings of a Final Four team reduced to ashes. 
The Wildcats have already lost to Northwestern (La.) State and Bowling Green at 
Rupp Arena, the 23,000-seat palace where Kentucky had lost a total of 18 games 
in the previous 12 years. This could easily be Kentucky's first losing season 
since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the Wildcats will play every game against a backdrop of 
controversy. "This team just hasn't had a chance to play basketball," Sean 
Sutton said. "It's always something." 
</P>
<P>
The whisper in college basketball has long been that Kentucky operates outside 
NCAA rules but somehow avoids detection or, if detected, punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's last investigation of the program, prompted by a series of stories 
in the Lexington Herald-Leader in October, 1985, did nothing to discourage such 
talk. The Herald-Leader interviewed 33 former Kentucky players, 26 of whom said 
they received improper benefits ranging from "$100 handshakes" to free meals. 
But the NCAA was unable to develop similar information during its investigation 
-- concluded only six weeks before the Emery story came to light -- although 
Kentucky was cited by the Committee on Infractions for a lack of cooperation 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada-Las Vegas coach Jerry Tarkanian, who has been taking shots at Kentucky 
for almost 20 years, recently told The Louisville Courier-Journal: "I still 
don't think Kentucky will get anything more than a one-year probation. Then 
when it's over, they'll throw them an honors banquet, have a parade and get 
ready for next year ... You just don't mess with the Big Blue." 
</P>
<P>
However, many of the Big Blue faithful seem resigned to the fact that the 
program will be nailed by the NCAA this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the last problem, compounded by this one, compounded by the national 
publicity involved has created a situation where the NCAA intends to penalize 
Kentucky in a major way," said Larry Forgy, a Lexington lawyer who is a member 
of the UK Board of Trustees as well as the UK Athletics Association's Board of 
Directors. "There has been no change in the infractions committee since the 
university was in front of it the last time. It's my understanding that there 
was some bitterness last time. I think if we were picking a jury, this wouldn't 
be the jury we would pick." 
</P>
<P>
D. Alan Williams, the University of Virginia history professor who chairs the 
Committee on Infractions, said he could not discuss the Kentucky situation 
because it is a pending case "except to say we are not a jury. We are a group 
of administrative judges. There lies a considerable difference." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more to the point is the fact that the current case is quite different 
from the last one. 
</P>
<P>
"The former case was a difficult case and not like this case at all," said 
Kentucky's acting athletic director, Joe Burch, who previously served as deputy 
general counsel for the university, "and one has to understand the distinctions 
between the two cases to understand how they might be looked at differently. 
There was no evidence in that other case that anyone was able to develop, 
including their (the NCAA) staff. We worked cooperatively with their staff on 
that case. It wasn't confrontational. Their staff was not able to develop the 
information, nor were we, because the information was totally based on 
newspaper reports. Reporters had talked to persons, and the persons were either 
unwilling to talk to us or said different things. There wasn't any independent 
evidence to go out and find." 
</P>
<P>
While many believe the Emery package has given the NCAA a smoking gun -- 
"People around campus are saying, 'Ah, we probably did it,"' student body 
president James Rose said -- the charge has been vigorously disputed by Casey, 
a member of Kentucky's 1978 national championship team who joined the school's 
coaching staff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Casey has filed a $6.9 million lawsuit against five Emery employees and 
Security Experts Inc., a New York-based firm that provides security for Emery's 
Los Angeles facility, and his attorney, Joe Bill Campbell of Bowling Green, 
Ky., has threatened to sue the NCAA and the university if they take action 
against Casey. Campbell says he would sue the NCAA for "breach of contract" on 
the premise that NCAA rules require the Committee on Infractions to base its 
findings on credible and persuasive evidence. 
</P>
<P>
According to Campbell, Casey put a package, an air bill and a videotape of one 
of Chris Mills' high school games on a receptionist's desk for shipment to 
Claud Mills last March 30 and then left on a trip to Louisville. Campbell says 
that Larnetta McDowell, a temporary employee who was working as a receptionist 
in the Kentucky athletic office at the time, has stated to him as well as 
Kentucky and NCAA investigators that she saw no money and that she put the tape 
in the package, sealed it and called Emery for pickup. "Her testimony is 
consistent and couldn't be better for us," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in depositions taken as part of a suit to perpetuate 
testimony filed by the university in anticipation of a suit by Casey, Emery 
employees have stuck to the essential facts of their stories. Both Claud and 
Chris Mills have denied receiving any money, but Emery employees testified that 
the package, with the money, was resealed and delivered to Mills' apartment. 
Emery driver David Jones stated that he gave the package to a young boy, who 
took the package inside and emerged with a receipt signed "C. Mills." 
</P>
<P>
Equally significant, and almost as murky, is the case of Eric Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
He reportedly twice failed to score above 700, the minimum standard for 
freshman eligibility under Proposition 48, on the Scholastic Aptitude Test when 
he took the test while attending high school in Macon, Ga. But when he took the 
American College Test in June, 1987, at Lafayette High School in Lexington, he 
reportedly scored a 23, eight points higher than the NCAA's minimum standard 
for the ACT and roughly equivalent to a 1,100 on the SATs. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has alleged that Manuel cheated by copying from the answer sheet of a 
student who sat adjacent to him during the test. According to the NCAA, a 
comparison of the answer sheets shows that 211 of 219 questions were answered 
identically. On seven of the eight other questions, the NCAA said, the spaces 
marked by Manuel were adjacent to the spaces marked by the other student, who, 
according to the NCAA, scored 24 on that test as well as a subsequent test. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NCAA, Manuel lied to the NCAA and the university when 
questioned about the test and refused to sign a release form authorizing ACT 
officials to compare his test booklet with that of the other student's when 
requested to do so by the NCAA and the university. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has cited Kentucky for failing to question the validity of Manuel's 
score based on his previous academic record. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before officially receiving the charge of academic fraud, the school 
announced that Manuel had withdrawn from the team, a move that at least one 
trustee, Cap Hershey, owner of Hillbrook Farm in Lexington, has openly 
criticized. Hershey acknowledges that "statistical evidence" weighs against 
Manuel but says the school has uncovered no direct evidence of cheating and 
should allow Manuel to play unless such evidence comes to light. "Everybody's 
taking the NCAA as the great word in the sky," he said, "and, hell, I don't 
think they are." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the key player in all this will be Roselle, a mathematics scholar 
who became Kentucky's president in July, 1987. When he took the job, he was 
expected to be more objective about athletics than his predecessor, Otis 
Singletary, "whose loyalty to his athletic department," Herald-Leader columnist 
Billy Reed wrote last summer, "often blinded him to its shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with crisis, that appears to be so. Hagan's resignation Nov. 15, 
according to a source close to the matter who asked not to be identified, was 
forced by Roselle because the president felt Hagan, an All-America basketball 
player at Kentucky in the '50s, had shown too little interest in dealing with 
the NCAA investigation. According to the source, Hagan once thumbed through a 
copy of USA Today during a meeting to discuss the case and, on another 
occasion, did paper work while a deposition was being taken in his office. 
</P>
<P>
Roselle is declining interview requests. Hagan has declined comment beyond his 
original prepared statement, in which he gave no reason for the resignation. 
Now working out of an office tucked away behind a copying machine in the 
administration building, he remains on the Kentucky payroll to "assist in the 
transition," according to Roselle's prepared statement on the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Next in line could be Sutton, whose contract contains a clause stating that any 
violation of NCAA rules is grounds for termination. "My thought about Mr. 
Sutton is that if these charges are ultimately found by the NCAA to be founded 
in fact, his job will be in serious jeopardy," trustee Forgy said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season began, Sutton laid down new ground rules for the media to 
restrict access to his players, and now, stung by public cries for his ouster, 
he is refusing interviews unless they deal strictly with basketball. And so it 
goes: from the Fabulous Five to Fort Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
A former member of the Republican National Committee who has been touted as a 
gubernatorial candidate in his state, Forgy believes the Kentucky situation can 
only be viewed fairly as a visible part of a national crisis. But, like many of 
his fellow Kentuckians, he believes some of the charges against Kentucky are 
serious and not likely to wash away. A visitor mentions that the Emery episode 
is, if nothing else, definitely bizarre. Forgy shrugs and says, "Well, a piece 
of tape started Watergate."

MOURNING IS MAKING HIS MARK -- QUICKLY

<TEXT>
<P>
It's taken Georgetown freshman Alonzo Mourning only 12 games to set two school 
records and conjure up comparisons to such stars as Patrick Ewing, Moses Malone 
and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
All the attention and acclaim is just grand, but Mourning would just as soon be 
recognized for his own talents rather than be cited as the second-coming of 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"All these comparisons create a little extra pressure," he admitted. "But I 
shouldn't let it get to me because I'm not Patrick Ewing or anyone else. I'm 
Alonzo Mourning. What I have to do is work hard and play my game, work to reach 
my goals and make a name for myself." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10 center needed little time to make an impression on the opposition 
and on the Georgetown record book. In his first home game, he registered the 
school's first "triple-double" by scoring 11 points, snaring 10 rebounds and 
blocking a Hoya-record 11 shots against St. Leo. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that since Moses, he's the best big kid to come out of 
high school," said Miami coach Bill Foster after Mourning burned the Hurricanes 
for 26 points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Mourning score 15 points and block seven shots against his team, 
Pitt coach Paul Evans, who coached Robinson at Navy, declared, "There's no 
comparison. Robinson averaged six minutes a game as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I said last year that if I was owner of one of the seven teams in the NBA 
lottery, I would have gotten Mourning out of high school," Evans added. "Two 
years down the road, he's better than the kids that went in the lottery last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning is the first Hoya to wear No. 33 since Ewing left the school in 1984. 
Georgetown guard Charles Smith, who played with Ewing, said Mourning has a good 
chance to be just as dominating as the man whose number he now wears. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improving every game because he's a hard worker in both practice and in 
games," Smith said. "He's getting the same publicity as Patrick, and has a good 
shot at being every bit as good." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning is averaging 14.5 points, 8 rebounds and 6 blocked shots a game. He's 
shooting 64 percent from the floor, but anguishes over every turnover and every 
personal foul. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have that much experience, so I'm going to make mistakes and do a lot 
of stupid things," he said. "It's all part of the learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sometimes it's hard to remember that Mourning is only 18 years old and 
just one year removed from playing high school ball in Chesapeake, Va. But his 
coach, John Thompson, who invited him to the tryouts for the 1988 U.S. Olympic 
team, hasn't lost sight of the fact. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes some freshman mistakes, but I think it would be kind of weird if in 
his freshman year he didn't," Thompson said. "I'm pleased, but I think we all 
have to remember that with all of the accolades and comparisons that we go 
through with Alonzo, he's still a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who last summer invited Mourning to try out for the 1988 U.S. Olympic 
team, said he is content to slowly bring him along. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want somebody to come in here at 18, 19 years old and become a 
super-human being," Thompson said. "He's got to go through a maturation period, 
so if he makes some mistakes it's a good thing, because it gives me a chance to 
teach." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Mourning didn't get to go to Seoul for the Olympics, he said the 
experience as the first high school player to participate in tryouts was a 
worthwhile one in preparing him for playing in the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying out for the Olympics and playing against all that talent really molded 
me to the point where I was ready," he said. "I was comfortable in the college 
atmosphere I was in, so I really didn't have to all of sudden adjust to it. 
Just by playing against that talent, I learned." 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything that separates Mourning from Ewing, Malone et al, it's his 
propensity to attempt -- and make -- long outside jump shots. He's clicked on 
his only three-point attempt, and swished a 17-footer in the Hoyas' 76-57 rout 
of Pitt last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson kiddingly claimed that Mourning's long-range talent could cost him 
money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Alonzo's a good outside shooter and that's the worst thing that can happen," 
Thompson said. "Sometimes a big guy is a good outside shooter and then he heads 
out there and starts to play well. Everytime he does that, I tell him, 'When 
you go into the NBA, that's going to take $3 million off your salary because 
guards don't get paid as much as centers.' 
</P>
<P>
"He's a center," Thompson deadpanned. "I've told him from the day I met him, in 
the NBA they play from the inside out. There are only about five centers 
available, and if you go out and play guard like 100,000 other people, that's 
foolish. But I think he can hit those outside shots."

NORTH CAROLINA'S REID IS TRYING TO ENJOY BOOKS AND BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY COTTON, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As it is for most families, this past Christmas was a time for the Herman Reid 
family of Virginia Beach, Va., to reminisce, remembering the days when little 
Herman would run the streets with his buddies, making mischief, only to have 
his father come out and put a stop to the foolishness and point him back toward 
his schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, little Herman is now J.R. Reid, a 6-foot-9, 260-pound Olympian and 
All-American at North Carolina, but Dad and the books still cast the bigger 
shadow. Right now, when father and son talk basketball, the discussion rarely 
goes beyond how to improve his outside shot or attain optimum defensive 
positioning and never focuses on the prospect of J.R. leaving school early to 
enter the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"In our family, we push education. We don't talk about pro ball," Herman Reid 
said. "As parents, you want your son to stay in school for 4 years. Right now, 
if we have anything to do with it, he will. His family isn't rich but he's got 
nice things. We want him to enjoy college." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, with his son's junior season limited to just 6 games thus far 
because of injury, it looks as if the elder Reid will get his wish. 
</P>
<P>
"If the pros were looking at me as one of the top three players, I guess I'd 
think about it after the season, but right now I'm in no rush to leave," J.R. 
Reid said. "I'm still learning about basketball, still learning the Carolina 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Declaring early eligibility and turning pro definitely isn't part of the 
Carolina system. In the school's long and successful history, only three 
players have gone pro before the end of their senior year: Bob McAdoo, James 
Worthy and Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy and Jordan met what seems to be Coach Dean Smith's criterion for 
departing early: the offer of exceptional money that goes along with being one 
of the first three players selected in the draft. Worthy was taken by the 
Lakers with the first overall pick in the 1982 draft. The Chicago Bulls 
selected Jordan with the third choice 2 years later. 
</P>
<P>
There is no consensus choice for top pick in the 1989 draft. Reid has been 
mentioned prominently, along with such seniors as Danny Ferry of Duke, Stacey 
King of Oklahoma and Pervis Ellison of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
And while Patrick Ewing and Danny Manning were automatic No. 1 picks in recent 
seasons, the order in which anyone is chosen this time around will be more 
dependent on the pre-draft lottery and then the needs of the individual teams 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, however, Reid is just trying to enjoy the game again, something that 
hasn't been easy since last summer. After the disappointment of the U.S. team's 
bronze-medal performance at the Seoul Olympics, Reid returned home, only to 
suffer a preseason injury, fracturing the fifth metatarsal bone in his left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Back in action for less than a month, Reid has played sparingly in six games, 
averaging 13 points and four rebounds in just over 20 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
But more playing time for Reid likely will set off a chain reaction: better 
numbers, with more wins and exposure for the Tar Heels. Should the team win the 
NCAA championship in this, one of the most wide-open of seasons, there would 
then be even more queries about the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Reid says he only wants to concentrate on total recovery from his injury 
and making North Carolina a better team. Still, given what's potentially at 
stake, it's hard not to look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't talk about it too much," said teammate Jeff Lebo. "I know he wants 
to concentrate on this year. But if I were in his position, knowing that I 
could be making a lot of money, it would have to go through my mind. It's hard 
to pass up, but then again you only go through college one time." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Herman Reid is against professional sports. The father played 
football with the Baltimore Colts, retiring when he discovered his wife Jean 
was pregnant with J.R. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he knew it was time to get a real job then," J.R. Reid said. That job 
turned out to be in education. Today, Herman Reid teaches health and physical 
education in Virginia Beach, while Jean teaches fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"These young guys grow up and decide that they can make their own decisions, 
and if J.R. did that I guess we'd have to live with it, but we're looking 
forward to him being at Carolina for his senior year," said Herman Reid. "If 
you get a degree, there are people pulling for you, people who say that if he 
had sense enough to graduate then he's got sense enough to work for my firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in life is promised to you but death, but some guys don't prepare for 
life after sports. Just look at the statistics of guys after they're through 
with their careers; they're homeless, or out trying to take any job somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Reid cites Ralph Sampson and Ewing as examples of players who played out 
their eligibility and still made good financially, but it's obvious the most 
compelling factor in any decision will be his father. Marveling at what he 
calls his parental guidance, J.R. Reid admits that, "I can't recall the last 
time I did anything without his consent. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when it was time to pick a college. Maryland was the first place I 
visited and when I got back I wanted to go there. My mom said to wait, and sure 
enough I decided that Carolina would be better for me. People forget that about 
college athletes. I'm only 20 years old. I'm young, still learning about life. 
I've watched others and learned and benefited from their mistakes. The NBA's 
been there a long time, I'm sure it'll be there without me for another year."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES;

BIG EAST CONFERENCE USED TO BE TOP HEAVY, BUT NOT THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took 10 years, but true parity seemingly has reached the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
For most of its existence, this made-for-television league has thrived around 
the success of four programs: Georgetown, St. John's, Villanova and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
From 1982 through 1987, these schools have combined for two national 
championships (Georgetown in 1984, Villanova in 1985) and seven Final Four 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
But the rap against the Big East was the bottom of its league, the clear 
separation between the haves and the have-nots. Judging from the first two 
months of this season, those days are over. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
Providence, expected to be a basement dweller this season, is off to a 3-0 
start for the first time in the league's first decade. The Friars, unbeaten 
going into Thursday night's game against Central Connecticut, also cracked the 
top 20 this week. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, which often rented out basement space itself, made the top 10 after 
beating Georgetown last week. Though the No. 13 Pirates were brought back to 
earth with a 90-66 shellacking at Syracuse, they are headed for a long home 
stand and a possible 18-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
Also: Georgetown lost to Seton Hall but crushed Pitt, which beat Syracuse, 
which lost to Villanova, which lost to Connecticut, which lost to Providence, 
which beat St. John's. Get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
"I think every time you step on a court in the Big East, you'd better be 
prepared or you're going to lose," said Seton Hall senior guard John Morton. "I 
think all the teams are competitive. The race is wide-open." 
</P>
<P>
What is the toughest place to play in the country? A typical list might include 
the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, N.Y., Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke in Durham, 
N.C., Allen Fieldhouse at Kansas, The Pit at New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But in terms of home-court winning streaks, the two places that hold the 
longest streaks for their schools are both pretty obscure: the Clark Center at 
Southern University and Kirby Fieldhouse at Lafayette in Easton, Pa. Lafayette 
seats 3,500, according to the fire marshals, but sometimes squeezes another 
1,000 into its own little pit. The Leopards have won 23 in a row, including an 
upset of Notre Dame there last season. Southern also has won 23 in a row at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Like many conferences, the Big Ten holds a weekly telephone hookup for the 
media with its coaches. But for the three years the league has been doing this, 
Indiana's Bob Knight never has partaken in the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who has his Hoosiers (12-4) on a nine-game winning streak, will go for 
his 500th career victory Saturday against Northwestern. Was Knight asked how it 
feels to go for 500? "Nobody asks Bobby Knight much of anything these days," 
said someone in the Big Ten office. 
</P>
<P>
The same can't be said of Michigan's Bill Frieder, who is making a habit of 
sticking his foot into his mouth. When told that Illinois Coach Lou Henson said 
that the sixth-ranked Wolverines were more talented than his second-ranked 
Illini, Frieder scoffed. "You tell Lou Henson that I'll bet him $500 that 
Illinois beats us on Saturday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Monday's matchup between Ohio State and Michigan in Ann Arbor, 
Mich., a game that will be shown on ESPN, Frieder said, "You tell Dick Vitale 
to bring all his b.s. up here. We need it to patch up Crisler Arena." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder is one of several coaches to have a book out on the market. 
Appropriately, it's called "Basket Case." 
</P>
<P>
When Temple's Duane Causwell had a wisdom tooth removed Sunday, a day after the 
Owls lost to North Carolina State on national television, Coach John Chaney 
took it as a good-luck charm for his team. Temple is 1-0 since, with a win over 
Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
Another tooth tale comes from Missouri. Within a week recently, freshman guard 
Anthony Peeler had a wisdom tooth pulled, and junior guard Lee Coward and 
Tigers Coach Norm Stewart each had root canal work done. 
</P>
<P>
"One more and I get one free," said Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Golenbock, the author of the forthcoming kiss-and-tell book about the 
North Carolina State basketball program, reportedly offered former Wolfpack 
players between $500 and $1,500 a half-hour for juicy information about Coach 
Jim Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Gannon, a former North Carolina State player who now works for a 
television station in Raleigh, N.C., said that he could see how the offer was 
enticing to some of his former teammates. "I know one guy who's working at 
McDonald's for $5.50 an hour," said Gannon. "For $500 a half-hour, he probably 
could have come up with something." 
</P>
<P>
Most junior college players love the attention they receive from big-time 
recruiters. Not David Butler. Last year, while at San Jacinto Junior College in 
Texas, he shaved the letters of the school name into his head (just San Jac, 
his head wasn't that big). Why did he do it? 
</P>
<P>
"To keep the recruiters away," said Butler. 
</P>
<P>
It worked, except for UNLV's Jerry Tarkanian. Butler now is playing with the 
Runnin' Rebels, and UNLV is shaved into his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands in New Jersey is installing a 
parquet floor, with Seton Hall and Connecticut to use it for the first time 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder if the new floor has anything to do with the Meadowlands beginning a 
full-scale assault to attract the 1994 NCAA Final Four? 
</P>
<P>
When Boston College guard Dana Barros threw in nine three-point shots against 
Pitt in an 95-83 upset of the Panthers, Pitt Coach Paul Evans was stunned by 
the distance on some of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those were fours," said Evans. Barros finished with 38 points, tying 
the Big East single-game scoring record set by Dan Callandrillo at Seton Hall 
during the 1981-82 season and equaled by both Seton Hall's Mark Bryant and 
Georgetown's Jaren Jackson last year.

UC IRVINE RISES UP, DOWNS SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine, the groundhogs of college basketball, dug another deep hole Saturday 
night, but this time the Anteaters managed to burrow out and bask in the light 
of a victory for a change. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters trailed San Jose State, 10-3, before rallying for a 71-62 Big 
West victory over the Spartans in front of 1,166 at San Jose Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (4-8 overall and 1-2 in the Big West) gained its first road victory 
since winning here last Feb. 15. The struggling Spartans fell to 5-10 and 1-5 
in conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of these teams desperately needed a win," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan 
said. "We were fortunate enough to get it. Every time we come up here, it's a 
war. I'm absolutely delighted with the win." 
</P>
<P>
Coming into the game, Mulligan was more worried about his team's mental state 
than its ability to run, jump, shoot and defend. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing has become a mind game with us," he said while relaxing in a 
hotel Jacuzzi before the game. "We need to take a psychiatrist on the road with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dok" was in Saturday night, but it was 6-foot 9-inch senior Mike 
Doktorczyk, not an analyst, who got the job done for Irvine. Doktorczyk led 
Irvine with 19 points and 10 rebounds, and, perhaps most important, he made 8 
consecutive free throws in the final 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It's not especially difficult to understand how the Anteaters won this game. 
They were 25 of 26 at the free-throw line and made 6-of-11 3-point attempts. 
Add that to the fact San Jose State guard Steve Haney, who came in with a 
19-point-per-game average, managed just 4 points and you get an Irvine win. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not your standard Anteater victory -- if there is such a thing 
when you've only won 4 games all season. Irvine's top 3 scorers -- Doktorczyk 
and guards Kevin Floyd and Rod Palmer -- were a combined 12 of 31 from the 
field. Palmer finished with 16 points and Floyd had just 11. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jeff Herdman, who had not started since the first game of the season, 
earned his starting spot back and made the most of it. The 6-6 sophomore from 
Mission Viejo made 6 of 7 shots from the floor -- including 3 of 3 from 3-point 
range -- and tied his career high with 15 points. He also had 5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
And the Anteaters excelled in a couple of facets of the game that they often 
choose to ignore . . . like rebounding and defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, who have been outrebounded by an average of 5 per game, beat the 
Spartans on the boards to the tune of 34-21, including a 19-9 first-half margin 
that helped them take a 34-31 lead at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine also managed to hold San Jose far below the 96-point average opponents 
have been scoring this season. And the Spartans' 45% field-goal percentage, 
while certainly respectable, was considerably less than Irvine's opponent 
average of 52%. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked our butts off on the boards," Doktorczyk said. "Santa Barbara killed 
us on the boards last Saturday so we've really been working on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Kevin (Floyd) at halftime that we couldn't let this game come down to 
the wire." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine led by as many as 13 early in the second half, but the Spartans cut the 
lead to 4 (55-51) with 3:47 remaining. The Anteaters made 12 free throws 
without a miss and Floyd scored on 2 coast-to-coast driving layups to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If Irvine hadn't shot quite so well at the line and on 3-pointers, it might 
have been a different story," Spartan Coach Bill Berry said. "I'm not sure what 
to say about us except that we're going to have to make some changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our effort was pretty good, but we forced some shots and missed some layups." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Dietrich Waters led San Jose with 19 points and 6 rebounds. Reserve 
Tony Farmer (12 points) was the only other Spartan in double figures. Haney's 
off night left a huge void in San Jose's offensive attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve just sort of took himself out of the game emotionally," Berry said. 
"They did an OK job of defending him, but he was just flat tonight. There were 
a lot of times he passed up shots. We need him to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was guarding Haney most of the night and admited that he was surprised 
as anyone the San Jose guard attempted just 7 shots and only a single 
3-pointer. Haney had attempted 94 3-pointers before Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting him to shoot the lights out. . . . any time he wanted from 
anywhere on the floor," Palmer said. "We knew they were going to use a lot of 
double picks to free him up, and I just tried to beat him to the spot. But I 
was really surprised he didn't shoot more." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was a somewhat strange game. But Irvine isn't complaining. The 
Anteaters get the rare opportunity to enjoy a road victory. . . . for one day, 
anyway. Monday night, they travel to Logan, Utah to meet Utah State, a team 
that was also celebrating Saturday night. The Aggies defeated previously 
unbeaten UC Santa Barbara, 78-65.

DANNY MANNING'S INJURY HITS THE STRUGGLING CLIPPERS HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since moving from Buffalo to the West Coast a decade ago, the Clippers have 
been the National Basketball Association's most beleaguered franchise, a 
monument to mismanagement and misfortune. But nothing could compare to the 
nightmare confronting them now. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Los Angeles have confirmed the worst, that rookie Danny Manning has 
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, an injury that 
will sideline him for at least a year and could prevent him from ever realizing 
his obvious and wondrous potential. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday in Los Angeles, Clippers management and team physicians huddled with 
Manning's agent, Ron Grinker, to ponder the next course of action in what 
promises to be a lengthy rehabilitation for the player chosen No. 1 overall in 
last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
Manning will have an arthroscopy to determine the extent of the tear. Then, in 
all likelihood, he will undergo reconstructive surgery. First, the Clippers 
must decide on a doctor. Grinker will not permit Tony Daly, the Clippers' team 
physician, to be involved because his clients (notably Derek Smith) have had 
bad experiences with Daly in the past. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Manning, who injured the knee coming down with a rebound in 
Milwaukee Jan. 4, faces a difficult rehabilitation. The injury is similar to 
that of former New York Knicks star Bernard King and former Los Angeles Laker 
Mitch Kupchak, who were never the same after suffering damage to an anterior 
cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
"If the injury is similar to mine, you're looking at one-and-a-half to two 
years," Kupchak, now the Lakers' assistant general manager, said. "If they 
reconstruct the knee, you have to hope the doctors do a good job. If he's given 
what's called a 'tight knee,' then there's a good chance he could be close to 
what he once was. But if he's given anything less than a good, tight knee, he 
will lose quite a bit of effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Scott, the Knicks' team physician, said he suspected the anterior 
cruciate when he heard Manning describe the knee having "snapped." 
</P>
<P>
"But there are two things in his favor," Scott told a Los Angeles reporter. 
"His youth and the fact it's the right leg and not the left." Manning 
ordinarily pushes off his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's injury has done nothing for the spirit of the Clippers, who were 
struggling before he was hurt and are struggling now. In successive road games, 
they lost by 35 to Indiana, 34 to the Knicks and 35 to Boston. Team President 
Alan Rothenberg was on hand for the latter two defeats, a discouraging sign for 
Coach Gene Shue. Observers in Los Angeles are wondering if Manning's injury 
will give Shue an excuse for his team's play, or expedite what seems to be his 
inevitable dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Willis Reed has accepted the inevitable and placed Dennis Hopson and 
Chris Morris in his starting lineup, it's time the New Jersey Nets bid a swift 
goodbye to Walter Berry, who no longer figures in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
There was little risk involved when the Nets acquired Berry from San Antonio 
for a second-round pick before the season. It was hoped Berry, sixth in the 
league in field-goal percentage last season, could provide offense while the 
Nets brought Morris along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
But Berry has been a bust offensively. Despite being in the final year of his 
original contract, Berry has shown little inclination to work diligently for 
another one. 
</P>
<P>
So the Nets might as well waive him, eat the remainder of his $300,000 salary 
and find a more willing body to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley and the 76ers will be featured on the Jan. 24 episode of the 
ABC series "thirtysomething," which is set in Philadelphia. Michael Steadman, 
the character played by Ken Olin, takes a feed from Barkley and slam dunks 
during a fantasy sequence. ... Having put up with the indifferent practice 
habits of Rony Seikaly and Pearl Washington for three months, Miami Heat 
coaches and front-office types vow never to draft another Syracuse player. . . 
. Roy Tarpley's drug relapse isn't the only problem in Dallas. As of Tuesday, 
Mark Aguirre hadn't scored 20 points for five straight games and had shot 39.6 
percent over his last 19. Aguirre, a 24.9-point career scorer, was down to 20.2 
for the year. ... Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi denies reports that he 
considered trading Rod Strickland to Indiana in a three-way deal that would 
have brought Kiki Vandeweghe to New York. Pacers General Manager Donnie Walsh 
says a three-way deal was discussed, but Strickland's name wasn't included. . . 
. Manute Bol, who was charged with drunk driving twice last summer, said he 
hasn't had a beer in four months. Bol is fast friends with recovering alcoholic 
Chris Mullin. "He and Chris are tight, really tight," Warriors assistant Garry 
St. Jean said.

MEN'S TENNIS IN STATE OF LEADERSHIP CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW WARSHAW, Associated Press 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men's tennis is bracing for the era of player power and the biggest upheaval 
since the sport opened its doors to professionals 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As the Australian Open gets under way in Melbourne on Monday, the first big 
tournament of what could be tennis' final season of the status quo, the world's 
top players want to scrap a system that has made them rich but which they view 
as messy, fragmented and physically too demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they say, their proposed breakaway Association of Tennis Professionals 
tour, scheduled for 1990, will be less cluttered, more competitive and 
exciting, and will include an eight-week off-season at the end of the year to 
let injuries heal. 
</P>
<P>
Stars such as Mats Wilander, John McEnroe and Pat Cash are preparing to run 
their own show, dictating who plays where, for what fee and against whom. 
</P>
<P>
If golf's professionals control their sport, why can't tennis professionals, 
the argument goes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always believed that the players should have more of a say in their own 
destiny," said Jimmy Connors, one of the longest-serving players on the men's 
tour. "This is their chance, and they must make it work. If it fails, and they 
have to go crawling on their knees back to the lawmakers, then it is the end of 
the sport as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the present Grand Prix, lifeblood of men's tennis for nearly 20 
years but now threatened with extinction, say the players are taking a huge 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
They warn the sport could be plunged into chaos if player power is allowed to 
take root, with many well-supported tournaments thrown on the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither side has yet struck a sponsorship deal -- Nabisco's backing of 
the Grand Prix runs out at the end of the year -- each has laid out a 
multimillion-dollar package to woo the players. 
</P>
<P>
"The ATP format is unfavorable for both the players and the tournaments," said 
Marshall Happer, director of the Men's Tennis Council, governing body of men's 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Happer said the council intends to continue with its own circuit in 1990 and 
has called a meeting in Melbourne on Sunday to try to resolve the biggest 
political split in recent tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still convinced that a compromise ... remains the optimum solution to the 
current dispute," Happer said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to ATP executive director Hamilton Jordan, Happer said the ATP's 
alternative tour was "not even close" in terms of benefitting players, 
tournaments or the sport in general to the council's Grand Prix format for 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We really should compromise before our sport goes into permanent turmoil," 
Happer warned. 
</P>
<P>
Under the present system, the ATP, the tournament directors and the 
International Tennis Federation -- which runs the Grand Slams, Davis Cup, 
Olympic tennis and the amateur game -- each has a third of the vote governing 
men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
The circuit's 78 Grand Prix events plus the year-end Masters are worth a total 
$37 million. The world's top 100 players are ordered by the council to play 14 
of these, including the Grand Slams, plus the Masters and the WCT finals in 
Dallas if eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 78 events are worth over $1 million each, including the four Grand 
Slams. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ATP tour will give players and tournament directors a 50-50 share 
of control, with a streamlined calendar of 19 showcase events, 13 of them with 
prize money of at least $1 million and six worth $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
The top players will have to play any 10 of these, plus the Grand Slams. Other 
players will earn their income through lower-level, less-lucrative tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the players say this format will stop rival tournaments being staged 
at the same time in different countries, a system that prevents the stars from 
playing each other on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"They are burning us out," said two-time Wimbledon champion and reigning 
Masters titlist Boris Becker, who has only met Wilander six times in five 
years. "Soon people will see better tennis and more big matches." 
</P>
<P>
Happer contends that a revamped Grand Prix tour run by the council would offer 
a far more lucrative alternative, with bonus and pension plans worth millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The players could have their 50 percent voting rights, he said, and an 
eight-week layoff, provided they are prepared to play more tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The answer from most of the stars is a firm "no." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to keep your interest up for so many tournaments when you don't play 
the best guys," said Wilander, the world's top-ranked player. "You don't get to 
see the top players against each other very often." 
</P>
<P>
Happer's hopes of maintaining partial control over the men's game suffered a 
serious blow last month when one his strongest supporters, ITF president 
Philippe Chatrier, softened his stance against the players' tour. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Chatrier said a change in the current system was "necessary and 
desirable" and would be best accomplished "in the context of a reorganized 
MTC." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "if all the tournaments and players want to join the ATP proposed 
tour, I shall sincerely wish them good luck, hoping the ATP will be able to 
meet that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The International Tennis Federation does not want to see a fragmented game 
that can only be damaging for our sport." 
</P>
<P>
As both sides fight for control of the game, tournament directors and sponsors 
have been left in limbo, waiting to see which way the axe falls. 
</P>
<P>
Many organizers of second-level events, assured hitherto of at least some top 
stars to boost interest, may now be left in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
They fear that with second-level players only, sponsors and spectators alike 
will desert them. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McManus, operations director of the ATP, said that with less than a year to 
go, no sponsorship of the proposed tour has yet been arranged. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the tour is a reality, our marketing department will be seeing what 
is available and what is most viable," he said. "No decision has been made 
whether the whole tour will be sponsored by the same company, or whether it 
will be broken into geographical areas or individual tournaments."

NHL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. PLAYERS ARE MAKING GREATER INROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last June, Detroit native Mike Modano was the No. 1 pick in the National Hockey 
League draft, becoming only the second American-born player to earn that 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Boston-born Jeremy Roenick became the first American to lead the 
world junior tournament in scoring with a record eight goals and 16 points in 
seven games. A look at the NHL's top rookie scorers through Wednesday showed 
Americans in second, third, fourth and sixth places; of the 11 highest-scoring 
defensemen in the league, four are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't just happen," said Bob Johnson, the executive director of USA 
Hockey, amateur hockey's governing body. "This has been a long development 
process. Finally, today American kids are getting an identity as good hockey 
players. There's a lot of good Americans out there." 
</P>
<P>
There were always a lot of good players on the ponds in Minnesota, Michigan and 
Massachusetts. The trick was to entice players from all parts of the country, 
making good instruction available and pinpointing the best players so their 
skills could be refined to the level of their Canadian, Soviet or Scandinavian 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, USA Hockey runs developmental camps for 16-, 17- and 
18-year-olds and juniors, sending them on to the national and Olympic teams, 
and eventually to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving the American boy a chance to reach his full potential," said 
Johnson, who has coached the Calgary Flames and at the University of Wisconsin. 
"When I grew up, the NHL was a mountain Americans never had a chance to climb. 
There was one, Tommy Williams, who played for Boston. Now there's 100 (112 at 
the start of the season), and 100 more in Europe. ... 
</P>
<P>
"People think our program wasn't very strong because we were seventh in the 
(1988) Olympics. I think we would have won a medal if our goaltending was 
stronger. That's how we won it in '60, with Jack McCartan, and in '80, with Jim 
Craig. Look at the talent on that ('88) team: Brian Leetch, Craig Janney and 
Tony Granato, and the best player, Corey Millen, isn't in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Millen didn't sign with the Rangers and is playing in Europe. "It's great to 
see these kids doing so well in the NHL, and I like what I saw of our junior 
team in Anchorage. We're awfully competitive now." 
</P>
<P>
If the New York Islanders finish last in the Patrick Division, which seems 
likely, they'll be the first team to fall from first place one season to last 
the next in more than 45 years. The 1941-42 Rangers finished first with a 
29-17-2 record but plunged in 1942-43 with an 11-31-8 mark. 
</P>
<P>
People will chuckle at the news that the Philadelphia Flyers will soon 
test-market a men's cologne called "Bully" in Philadelphia stores. The letter 
"B" will be shaped like the "P" in the Flyers' logo. Great name, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Blackhawks are looking for an experienced goaltender, and the man 
they want is Boston's Rejean Lemelin. After losing goalie Darren Pang because 
of a severe hamstring pull, they promoted John Reid from Saginaw, Mich., of the 
International Hockey League, only to have Reid break a bone in his hand Monday. 
They're in the midst of playing seven games in 11 nights and need help fast. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's trade of Ville Siren to Minnesota for Gord Dineen and Scott 
Bjugstad was curious to begin with. It looks even worse since Zarley Zalapski 
underwent arthroscopic knee surgery that will idle him for six weeks and since 
shoulder problems have bothered Paul Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Coffey and Zalapski, the Penguins have no defensemen capable of moving 
the puck out of the defensive zone, as Siren can. But sources have said the 
Finnish defenseman was sent packing because General Manager Tony Esposito 
doesn't like European players. Bjugstad is a winger who lost his scoring touch 
in Minnesota, and Dineen is a marginal defenseman who isn't physical. Defense 
is the Penguins' sole weakness and might ultimately prove their downfall come 
playoff time, when defense traditionally outweighs offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg Jets will retire Bobby Hull's No. 9 in a special ceremony 
scheduled in March. His number has been retired by the Chicago Blackhawks, so 
he will join Gordie Howe (Detroit and Hartford) as the only other player to 
have enjoyed two such honors. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL's jump to SportsChannel America this season would have looked brilliant 
if SportsChannel America had won the cable TV rights for baseball. Many cable 
systems that don't carry SportsChannel would have picked it up to get baseball; 
as it stands, fans in many NHL franchise cities can't get SportsChannel 
telecasts.

MATER DEI USES FOUL SHOTS TO BEAT OCEAN VIEW, 76-68 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through the first half Saturday night, while the teams were being 
assessed 25 fouls, Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight turned to the press table and 
said, "These fouls take all the fun out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
But McKnight could find little to complain about in the fourth quarter when his 
team made 11 consecutive free throws to earn a 76-68 nonleague victory over 
Ocean View in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (18-2) didn't miss a shot at the foul line in the final quarter and 
was 37 of 46 for the game. Ocean View (11-7) was cited for 28 personal fouls. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second loss for the Seahawks against Mater Dei this season. Mater 
Dei had won, 58-43, in the Tournament of Champions final. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dylan Rigdon, who didn't start because of a nagging back injury, led all 
scorers with 27 points, and teammate Mike Morris added 17. Center Todd Norman 
scored 24 points for Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for some of the more unusual aspects of the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first quarter took nearly 40 minutes to play and included some bizarre 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The teams were assessed 20 fouls between them in the 8 minutes of play. 
Mater Dei shot 20 free throws and made 15 for a 25-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There were four technical fouls called, two on the Ocean View bench, one on 
the Mater Dei bench and one on an Ocean View player. Mater Dei point guard 
Jason Quinn was sent sprawling to the floor twice with his in-your-face 
defensive tactics against Ocean View's Mike Frohn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The teams had to be separated by officials twice, with Ocean View's Norman 
and Mater Dei's Andy Karich exchanging words at midcourt. Tempers flared to the 
point where officials called a timeout to allow the teams and coaches to cool 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, there was an 8-point play. Mater Dei was the beneficiary with 38 
seconds remaining in the first quarter when Morris was fouled and official Lee 
Phelps called two technicals on the Ocean View bench. 
</P>
<P>
Morris made both free throws, Rigdon made 4 more free throws for the bench 
technicals and then Rigdon scored a layup on the ensuing inbounds play. Presto, 
8 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Norman rallied Ocean View in the second quarter, scoring 14 of the 
Seahawks' 24 points. Norman's play helped Ocean View narrow a once-big deficit 
to 39-38 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View opened the second half by scoring 7 consecutive points to take a 
45-39 lead. Guard Greg Evans gave the Seahawks their first lead of the game, 
41-39, with a 3-point shot to open the half. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View was still in control, 55-51, at the conclusion of the third quarter 
after reserve John Phillips made a 3-point shot at the buzzer. But Mater Dei 
tied the game, 57-57, when Rigdon hit a 15-foot jump shot with 5:29 remaining 
in the fourth quarter.

HE BEATS THE BUSHES FOR TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Searching for those with attention-getting ability, or even those with only an 
occasional spark of it, in the rich baseball vineyards of California is a 
constant calling for Al Kubski. 
</P>
<P>
His business card reads, "Scout, Kansas City Royals." He is more a realist than 
a dreamer, which is why he gets paid to be demandingly discriminating in the 
difficult process of charting talent. 
</P>
<P>
Kubski, who lives in Carlsbad, Calif., is visiting his brothers in Baltimore 
and took time to relate varied experiences of seasons past and to destroy some 
long-accepted myths that have as much validity as old wives' tales. 
</P>
<P>
His outdoor office, so to speak, is located in Southern California, an 
incubator for so many multi-talented players. The area has more scouts than any 
section of the country, with most major-league clubs having as many as four 
full-time men working the territory. Harry Dalton, general manager of the 
Milwaukee Brewers, said last year that 30 percent of the players in the 
American and National Leagues were born in California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to understand," remarked Kubski, "when you consider the state has a 
population of 13 million. Regularly scheduled amateur games go on from Jan. 7 
until the following Dec. 15. When I began with Baltimore, in 1963, I covered 
from Fresno, south to the Mexican border and into the state of New Mexico. Now 
the scouting is more concentrated. Often, a scout can see three games a day. I 
probably averaged 10 games a week from March until June. Some of the colleges 
and high schools play at night, which makes it easier to crowd in a lot of 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Kubski's recommendations sent Bobby Grich and Doug DeCinces to the Baltimore 
Orioles before he joined Dalton with the California Angels, where he remained 
five years. John Schuerholz, general manager of the Kansas City Royals, hired 
Kubski 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he managed 10 seasons in the minor leagues, most of the time for the 
St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates, plus independent clubs in such 
places as Blackwell, Okla., in the Sooner State League, and Kilgore, Texas, in 
the East Texas League. 
</P>
<P>
It has been an enjoyable life, but not an easy one. For 10 years, Kubski 
managed Christobal in the Panama Winter League and won nine pennants, using 
such players as Bobby Young, Lou Sleater, Tommy Lasorda, Don "Tex" Warfield, 
Bill Sweiger, Lou Grasmick, Clem Koshorek, Milt Graff and Spook Jacobs. With 
that kind of a background, plus experience as a player in the minors both 
before and after World War II, it's reasonable to expect that Kubski knows a 
prospect when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
About Bo Jackson, the Royals' outfielder who also runs a football for the Los 
Angeles Raiders, he says, "He has as much ability as anyone in baseball. He can 
throw, run and hit. He could have been another Mickey Mantle. Why, John Wathan, 
the manager, told me he saw him jump in the batting cage and take three swings 
left-handed. Two balls he hit went off the bank high up in right field at 
Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
Kubski was managing Grand Forks in the Northern League in 1952 when he was 
attracted to a young shortstop with Eau Claire, a farm club of the then-Boston 
Braves. The kid player later moved to the outfield and, ultimately, Henry Aaron 
accounted for more home runs than Babe Ruth. Ah, the treasured gems that are 
filed away in the untapped storehouse of a scout's memory. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting to hear Kubski's views, based on almost 50 years in the game. 
He says it is indeed possible, although rare, for youngsters to improve 
physical skills such as throwing, running and hitting. Some of his most notable 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
Tom Seaver: "I saw him, if you can believe it, when he had a below-average 
fastball. The Dodgers were only going to offer him $12,000. Some clubs wouldn't 
give him over $4,000. But he pitched against a team called the Crosby All-Stars 
one winter and was facing a lot of active major-leaguers. He struck out 12 in 
five innings. Milwaukee had his draft rights and was trying to sign him but it 
was ruled illegal and the commissioner declared Tom a free agent. The Mets got 
Seaver and signed him for $50,000. I found out then that, yes, after 18 a 
fastball can be improved. It's unusual but it can happen, as I saw with 
Seaver." 
</P>
<P>
George Brett: "When I first worked him out, he held his bat real high. He 
didn't show much power. But he was a competitor. Lou Pinella convinced him he 
could drive the ball with authority rather than just hit line drives. And then 
Charlie Lau, the batting coach, showed him how to get the barrel of the bat out 
front. He's headed for the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Skinner: "I never thought a player's running speed could increase, yet it 
happened with Bob. He was a poor runner. But a track coach got him along the 
way and showed him how to lengthen his stride. He was an excellent hitter, with 
good power. The surprising thing is he improved his running. I think about that 
every time someone says it's impossible to help an athlete run faster. You can 
learn to run better, the same as you can improve as a fielder." 
</P>
<P>
Dave May: "I was managing Kingsport in the Appalachian League when I saw Dave 
May. He was at Salem, Va., and was a great young hitter. But he had one of the 
worst arms I ever saw in organized baseball. A poor arm is rated a No. 2. He 
wasn't even a No. 2. The Orioles drafted him and he kept hitting, but he 
couldn't throw. I remember once in the minor-league camp when Jim Frey took him 
to center field, about 300 feet from home plate, and showed him how to get more 
of his lower body and back into the throws. But the best he could do was get 
the ball to roll to the pitcher's mound. Then his arm came around. He told me 
he went into his cellar at home in the winter and threw against a wall. His 
shoulder pained but he kept it up. Finally, something loosened and he had an 
above-average big league arm. I couldn't believe it but, again, I saw a 
baseball miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Stargell: "He was a 165-pound rookie when I was his first manager at 
Roswell, N.M., in 1959 and he had it tough. A black player who couldn't stay 
with us or eat with us. It was difficult. But we talked a lot and I told him 
what he was having to endure would make him a stronger person and even a better 
player. He hit seven home runs, all over the left field fence. But as he got 
heavier, he showed more power and began to pull pitches instead of hitting to 
the opposite field. He said in his book I helped him and I'm pleased at that." 
</P>
<P>
As for hard throwers, Kubski pre-dates the radar gun. He said the highest 
clockings he ever saw were Nolan Ryan and Rich Gossage at 94 mph. "It's amazing 
how few pitchers ever get to 85 on the gun," he comments. "Right now there are 
only three college pitchers I know of who can go over 85. So the way a pitcher 
throws is frequently exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
He, remembers, too, when he played in a Cardinals system that had 29 farm 
clubs. That was the era of chain-store baseball and a time when virtually every 
youngster in America wanted to be in baseball. Kubski also has seen all the 
other sports offer high financial rewards, which means baseball has lost out to 
some degree to pro football, basketball, golf and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
But Al Kubski's objective never changes -- to find players who can fulfill the 
ultimate ambition he holds for all of them. It's the major leagues, where so 
many are called and a mere handful chosen.

REDELL BIDS FAREWELL TO FOOTBALL AS PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Redell, who resigned as Crespi High's football coach in December, said 
this week that he will not pursue another coaching position next fall and has 
retired from the profession. Redell, who works as an insurance salesman, had 
contacted Athletic Director Stan Morrison of UC Santa Barbara about a position 
with the Gauchos, but nothing has developed. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a couple other inquiries but nothing materialized so I guess it's time 
to get out," Redell said. "I'm not willing to run all over the country. If I 
was 30 it would be one thing, but I'm 47. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss it because it was so much fun. At least I can say the last 
game I coached was in the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Redell has been selected as a co-coach for the South team in this summer's 
Shrine All-Star Game at the Rose Bowl. He also will be co-coach in a summer 
Valley-area all-star game sponsored by the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
Redell coached for 2 years in the now-defunct United States Football League and 
was an all-pro quarterback in the Canadian Football League. He compiled a 
43-16-1 record in 5 years in 2 stints at Crespi and coached the school to its 
only Southern Section football title when the Celts won the Big Five Conference 
title in 1986. JOHN LYNCH

BEL-AIR PREP SURPRISES FAITH BAPTIST, 63-53 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a new force in the Delphic League. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial power Crossroads High has been beaten by Bel-Air Prep 3 out of their 
past 4 meetings. And Saturday night at home, Faith Baptist couldn't get past 
Bel-Air Prep, suffering its first league loss, 63-53. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist (11-3, 3-1 in league play) was without 6-10 center Jason 
Henderson, who sprained his right ankle in a victory over Providence on 
Tuesday. Picking up the slack was too tall an order for the Contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish he was in there," Bel-Air Coach Mike Whiting said of Henderson. "I 
don't like to see a team not at full strength. But in our two league losses we 
were missing two key players. 
</P>
<P>
"This time it was our turn." 
</P>
<P>
Taking turns on offense for Bel-Air Prep (9-7, 3-2) were Ahmad Clayton, who 
scored a team-high 18 points, Jason Plazoulo (14) and Gerald Hill (13). 
</P>
<P>
Plazoulo also enjoyed the absence of Henderson under the backboards, bringing 
down a team-high 8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist Coach Dean Lobdell conceded that the loss of Henderson, who 
averages 17 points and 13 rebounds a game, was crucial. "When Jason's in there, 
it gives us those extra rebounds and closes down the middle," Lobdell said. "We 
got no second shots and we had no inside game without him." 
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air Prep took an early lead and maintained it throughout the game. The 
Bruins led only 34-30 at halftime after committing a series of turnovers but 
extended the advantage to 47-38 after 3 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist pulled to within 6 points early in the fourth quarter but missed 
9 of 15 free throws in the period. Bel-Air Prep connected on 6 of 8 and 
stretched its lead to 11. 
</P>
<P>
Guard David Hairston led Faith Baptist with 22 points, 13 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night someone is going to pick us up," Whiting said. "We built intensity 
in spurts and when we play together we can beat anybody."

YOUNG RUNNERS HOT ON CONCEPT OF A RACE WHERE THEY ARE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a biting chill in the air at Mission Bay Park Saturday morning. The 
bay was smooth, as if it were frozen. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature had dipped into the low 30s overnight and didn't seem much 
warmer at 8 a.m., but approximately 4,000 people were there to participate in 
the fifth annual McClassic, which included a 4-mile walk, a 10-kilometer run 
and the 1-mile event for kids. 
</P>
<P>
Kids? About a thousand of them. What cold? They came to run. 
</P>
<P>
They were everywhere, buzzing around in shiny tights and flashy shoes, waiting 
for the start of their race. They were Saturday's stars. Organizers hoped 
something for those 12 and under would be the drawing card for a 
family-oriented event and exemplify its purpose, to benefit the McDonald's Big 
Kids for Little Kids, a non-profit child abuse prevention organization. 
</P>
<P>
The contestants displayed their race bibs as if they were Olympic medals. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's only a mile, look at the faces on the kids here," said Tony 
Gwynn, the Padre outfielder and the official starter. "They're stretching out 
like the big guys, getting their legs loose, doing their little aerobic dances 
to get warmed up. It's awesome, it really is. One of these kids will have a 
great time in the mile run. Probably run it faster than I could." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the concentration of this event was on the 10K. Prize money was 
offered to lure name runners. But there was no purse this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some outstanding times for the finishes of the race," said John 
Ryal, president of the San Diego McDonald's Operators Assn. "But it really did 
not end up generating more money for the charity. Our thinking is to keep the 
money for the kids (rather) than reward somebody for coming out and running." 
</P>
<P>
Ryal said this year's proceeds -- between $20,000 and $25,000 -- were double 
the event's best previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Just to the left of where Ryal was talking, a little boy shyly nudged toward 
Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, how ya doin'?" Gwynn asked. "Ready for this run?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," mumbled the boy, who was no older than 8. 
</P>
<P>
"You gonna make it?" Gwynn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
"You gonna win?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
"You're gonna win it? All right! I'll be looking for you. How fast you gonna 
run it? Five minutes? Six?" 
</P>
<P>
"Six." 
</P>
<P>
"That's faster than I can run it now. You'd beat me, easy." 
</P>
<P>
The boy smiled, got an autograph on his race number and headed toward the 
starting line, where a majority of the kids had already gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn and Ronald McDonald stood in front of the crowd at the starting line, 
trying to organize the smaller ones to the front and urge the bigger ones not 
to stampede. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody ready to run today?" Gwynn asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah!" hollered the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, when you start, be careful, don't run over somebody's back," Gwynn 
said. "Some of the parents, too, when the kids take off, please be careful. 
Don't jump out in the middle of the street and try to get a picture." 
</P>
<P>
Shane Mullen, a 12-year-old from Evans Elementary School in La Jolla, ran the 
flat course in 5 minutes 40 seconds, faster than what Gwynn said he could do. 
Gwynn would have been more amazed if he knew that Mullen earlier had been the 
first 12-year-old to finish the 10K, in 43:49. Mullen runs 4 miles every 
morning with his mother, Martha. Has since he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Ramos, a 12-year-old sixth-grader from Jose Maria La Roce school in 
Tijuana, was the first girl to finish (6:12) and fourth overall. She has been 
running since she was 6. 
</P>
<P>
Some were winded, some pained. For others, it was no big thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Great race," a father asked his son at the finish. "Was it fun?" 
</P>
<P>
The little boy shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear your name called when you came across?" 
</P>
<P>
The little boy wiped his brow and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it exciting when you went under the big banner (at the finish line)?" 
</P>
<P>
The boy brushed his dark hair off his forehead, looked up at his father, smiled 
and nodded.

Two relatively new phenomena, which seem to be related, are starting to get on 
my nerves. 
</P>
<P>
You saw one during the National Football League playoffs: "This kickoff is 
brought to you by Budweiser." 
</P>
<P>
I imagine a Clydesdale could kick a football a long way, given the proper 
training, but I never saw one on the screen. It always seemed that the kickoff 
was being brought about by a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is the phenomenon that seems to indicate that eventually every 
aspect of every game will be bought and sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
You have probably guessed by now that unwieldly names are my other gripe, 
particularly those with blatant commercial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming in February, for example, is the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, which 
was recently trimmed a bit from the Shearson Lehman Hutton Andy Williams Open. 
I'm not sure why Andy Williams became disassociated with the tournament, unless 
maybe he was tired of being asked for tips on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, a release arrived trumpeting a new name for San Diego's LPGA 
tournament. It did not cut back. It expanded from Kyocera Inamori Classic to 
Red Robin Kyocera Inamori Classic, a change that plays into the fact that I 
think such titles are all for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open nor the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori 
Classic suggests in title where in the world these tournaments are being held, 
which could be Tallahassee or Corpus Christi as far as the fan in Peoria knows. 
</P>
<P>
Thank heaven that Mutual of New York is willing to settle for MONY in front of 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl has been the Sea World Holiday Bowl, but the latest word is 
that Sea World is willing to bow out to a buyout from a sponsor willing and 
able to kick in bigger bucks. This, of course, could lead to the game being 
called the Holiday Inn Holiday Bowl . . . or maybe the Holiday on Ice Judy 
Holliday Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State offers corporate sponsorships of both specific programs and 
individual games within those programs. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, for example, I suppose it costs more to sponsor a game with the 
Robert Redford Sundance Brigham Young University Cougars or American Tobacco 
Company University of North Carolina Tars and Nicotines than it would to 
sponsor a game with the Log Cabin Maple Syrup University of Vermont Catamounts. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the world is changing. 
</P>
<P>
This plague has even reached the high school level, where an athletic director 
called to plead that a corporate sponsor should be included in the name of one 
of the traditional basketball tournaments hereabouts. And teams are no longer 
the champions of the CIF San Diego Section Playoffs, but rather the Reebok CIF 
San Diego Section Playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Where to from here? 
</P>
<P>
I can imagine the headlines, news stories and broadcasts of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Let's super-impose the present on the future . . .

KINGS' 5-GOAL THIRD PERIOD WEARS DOWN WHALERS, 9-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a little help from his friend John Tonelli, who dug the puck out of the 
corner for him, Ron Duguay scored the goal that jolted the Kings back to life 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Duguay scored again less than 3 minutes later to tie the game. Then it was 
Tonelli, with his second goal of the night. And then Bernie Nicholls with 
consecutive goals to ice it. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored five goals in the third period to beat the Hartford Whalers, 
9-6, before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings never should have needed the last-ditch heroics, not after jumping 
out to a 3-0 lead against a team that's in fourth place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a strange, strange game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings won their third in a row by scoring the first 3 goals and the last 5, 
with the Whalers dancing all over them in between. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out to start the third period losing (6-4) to a team that we feel 
we're better than," Duguay said. "There is no way this team should have been 
beating us. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked so hard all year trying to get ahead of Calgary and stay ahead of 
Edmonton. Why do all that work and then lose a game like this? That was enough 
to motivate us." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Robbie Ftorek called it "a funny game." As for the quick attack by Duguay 
at the start of the third period, Ftorek said: "They're up 6-4, but if we get 
the first goal of the period, they're back on their heels. We did that. That 
leaves them saying, 'Uh-oh.' Because they know we've got some firepower." 
</P>
<P>
Which is putting it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
Duguay thinks maybe the team relies a little too much on that firepower. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we were overconfident," he said. "That's only natural when 
things come so easy. But we can't rely on our talent and forget to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
At no point did Tonelli forget to work hard Saturday night. Even Ftorek had to 
smile when Tonelli went huffing and puffing past the Kings' bench in pursuit of 
a puck that was just out of reach. Ftorek did a quick impression of Tonelli 
panting away. "But that's the way he works," Ftorek said. "You know he's going 
to get it eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli finished with 2 goals and 2 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli especially liked the assist that gave Duguay his first goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy when he put the puck in the net," Tonelli said. "He's had some 
tough luck this year, but he turned the game around for us tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone stuck their noses in it in the third, and we played as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, Hartford goalie Mike Liut said he thought the Whalers 
were guilty of the same mistake that Duguay thought was the Kings' undoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We were guilty of sitting on the lead," Liut said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings (27-15-3) did it first. They seemed so impressed by their 3-0 
lead (on goals by Tonelli, Luc Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky) that they started 
to call it a night before the middle of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers (17-21-3) scored the next 4 goals -- 3 by the end of the first 
period to tie it and the fourth at 8:17 of the second period to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky tied it for the Kings at 9:13, and then it was all Whalers again. They 
scored 2 more and went into the final period with a 6-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek said he briefly thought about relieving rookie goalie Mark Fitzpatrick. 
He didn't, because for one thing, Glenn Healy has a touch of the flu, and for 
another, Ftorek didn't think all the goals were Fitzpatrick's fault. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the start, it should have been an easy night for the King goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli scored just 1:20 into the game, waiting at the right post to put in a 
pass from Mike Krushelnyski. Robitaille scored his goal at 3:11, taking a 
slapshot from the top of the left circle instead of passing to Gretzky on the 
other side. The move surprised Liut, who had started the other way in 
anticipation of the pass to Gretzky. Gretzky then scored his first goal at 6:45 
on a power play, deflecting in a long shot by Steve Duchesne and giving the 
Kings a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Hartford's turn. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Francis got the Whalers started with a power-play goal after Fitzpatrick 
had made a stop on a shot by Norm Maciver. Francis was there to put in the 
rebound at 8:37. Ray Ferraro added another power-play goal at 14:32, directing 
in a long, slow slot from the right circle by John Anderson. And Scott Young 
beat the Kings to a shot off the boards and passed to Dean Evason in front of 
the King net for the tying goal at 18:26. 
</P>
<P>
The second period was almost as busy. 
</P>
<P>
Young drove down the right side to take a shot that glanced off Fitzpatrick's 
stick and into the net at 8:17. But Gretzky tied it, putting in the rebound of 
a shot by Marty McSorley at 9:13. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers went ahead again, 5-4, at 13:41. Fitzpatrick had just made a stop, 
and the Kings were heading for the other end when Francis tipped the puck away 
and passed it back to Gord Dineen, who was trailing. He turned and, 
uncontested, flipped it past Fitzpatrick. Then Paul MacDermid scored an 
unassisted power-play goal at 18:30. 
</P>
<P>
So it was 6-4 going into the third period, when Duguay got the Kings going 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Duguay was not a likely hero. Since coming to the Kings from the New York 
Rangers in a trade for Mark Hardy last February, Duguay has been asked to play 
a defensive role. He had a total of 2 goals for the Kings in the 15 games he 
played for them last season. He matched that Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
With a smile, Duguay conceded that offense is fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice feeling for me to be able to help the team offensively," he said. 
"My role is more or less defensive, so it's very satisfying to be able to come 
out of a big game with a couple of goals." 
</P>
<P>
Duguay, at 31 among the oldest of the Kings, is the only player on the team who 
skates without a helmet, so he always stands out. And he's always working. 
</P>
<P>
But Duguay says that Tonelli, also 31, inspires him. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny has been fired up all year," Duguay said. "I had a lot of respect for 
him when I used to play against him, but now that I've had a chance to play 
with him as a teammate and really see what he's made of, I have even more 
respect for him. He works so damn hard, every game and every practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It really picks me up." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli's second goal Saturday night gave him the 700th point of his 
career. He was with the New York Islanders for four Stanley Cup championships. 
. . . Bernie Nicholls' second goal of the night was No. 45 for him this season. 
Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh leads the league with 47. . . . The sellout 
Saturday night was the Kings' 11th of the season, adding to the club record. . 
. . The last regular-season meeting between the Kings and the Whalers will be 
next Saturday night at Hartford, Conn. The Kings' next 4 games will be on the 
road. . . . The Kings are 21-6-0 against teams outside their division. . . . 
Mike Allison did not dress for the game because of a knee injury.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE HAS FARED BETTER THAN IN FAREWELL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earvin (Magic) (Buck) Johnson, an athlete so great he has two nicknames, one 
for his public and one for his peers, told me the other night about something 
that happened between him and Kareem (Cap) Abdul-Jabbar while they were taking 
a shower last Tuesday night, after the Lakers had lost -- on the road, of 
course -- to the Sacramento (ugh) Kings. 
</P>
<P>
According to Magic, Kareem came up to him and asked: "Buck, what's wrong with 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
Magic gave him a straight answer. "Cap," he said, "you just ain't been 
aggressive. You're not hungry like you used to be. You're not attacking. You 
don't go after the ball. You don't go after your shot. You're not yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Role reversal was hereby complete, like a parent in a nursing home relying on 
the child he or she reared. The 41 3/4-year-old king of the court, oldest 
player and greatest scorer in National Basketball Assn. annals, now turned to 
his 29-year-old student prince for advice. So deferential is the 
elder-respectful Johnson that he never would have volunteered any advice to 
Abdul-Jabbar, but he was happy to be asked, because he worships the old man. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar had, in his own coach's words, "gone stale." He was half the 
player he used to be. His points and minutes were down. His right knee was 
badly bruised, and so was his ego. His contribution to Laker successes was 
becoming negligible. He was 23rd among NBA centers in rebounding. He had 
attempted 50 free throws, or fewer than 2 a night. The same man who, as 
recently as 1987, had scored in double figures in 787 consecutive games has, as 
of today, reached double figures 10 times in 27 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley felt compelled to call his center aside at Friday's shootaround and 
suggest that if Kareem's play did not improve over the next couple of weeks, he 
would bench the man who has started more than 1,500 NBA games, use him strictly 
in reserve. Kareem, the coach said, consented to this arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Riley either was remedying his problem by being realistic, or by attempting to 
motivate Abdul-Jabbar by appealing to his pride, or both. One thing he was sure 
of: There had been such a groundswell of "undue criticism" toward Kareem that 
some of the Lakers were beginning to be affected by it. Then again, that's a 
handy scapegoat; when something has gone wrong, blame those who dare say it has 
gone wrong. 
</P>
<P>
True, it was getting nasty out there. More than one Los Angeles columnist had 
called for Kareem to take early retirement. On an ESPN talk show last week, 
columnist Bill Conlin of the Philadelphia Daily News called Abdul-Jabbar 
"worthless, totally worthless . . . a zero on defense, like a barber pole." New 
York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica wholeheartedly agreed. "This guy has 
stayed too long at the dance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley called a private meeting with Abdul-Jabbar and a second meeting with the 
entire team. "I wanted to clear the air, clarify our statement about our center 
position," Riley said. "It's just been hanging there like a big cloud, and it 
was counterproductive. All the critics wanting to force him to retire, it, 
well, it created a burden on our club. Sometimes you, as a club, begin to 
wonder if everybody else is right when they say stuff about you. It seeps into 
your thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I want to make it clear right now: This is our team. Kareem's on it. He's 
here. He's gonna stay here. He's still a force, and I believe in him. For the 
next few weeks, I've asked him to go as hard as he can. If, in 2-3 weeks, 
things haven't changed, we'll probably experiment with Kareem coming off the 
bench. And he's open to that. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy has carried us for 14 years. Fourteen years! We're all wearing rings 
because of him. The way I figure it, we've gotta back him up. We owe him that. 
We owe him respect," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered what Kareem thought about all this. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of hours before Friday night's game against Cleveland, I was able to 
get Abdul-Jabbar off by himself for a while, to hear his side of things. So 
many others had been speculating on his play, on his current worth, on his 
future, I wanted to hear from him for a change, see what concerns, if any, he 
had. 
</P>
<P>
We went into a room not much larger than the man himself, with a doctor's 
reclining chair, a little table and little else. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want to know?" Abdul-Jabbar wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Well, let's start with that road record. Eight straight defeats away 
from home. Is that a source of unusual aggravation? 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar: Oh, definitely. The whole team's disappointed in our inability to 
be consistent and play up to our level. If we just went out and played as well 
as we could and coordinated our efforts, we'd be better -- not that we're that 
bad now, as far as our position in the standings -- but it would be a lot more 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you get a handle on what's gone wrong on the road? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know. You've got a team that's played so well for so long and 
finally achieved what we wanted most, that being back-to-back world 
championships, something no one else has done (since 1969), so I don't think 
anybody here would question whether we've had a kind of collective, uh, 
relaxation. The fact that we've maintained such an intense state of 
concentration and preparation, for years and years and years, helps explain 
what's happened to us mentally. I know that's the case for me, personally. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would you say you are satisfied or dissatisfied with your own play this 
season? 
</P>
<P>
A. Definitely not satisfied. I think the injury really got to me right at the 
point where I was coming around. That was a setback. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Ever regret at all having come back for one more season? 
</P>
<P>
A. No, I don't have any regrets. I just wish I had prepared better. But it was 
very hard for me to do that facing what I was going to be facing this year. I 
just had a tendency to focus on that and not getting physically and mentally in 
the shape I should have been in when the season started. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you contrast your play with last year's? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm not playing well on either end of the court. (From the start) I wasn't 
moving well. I just wasn't in real good condition to play basketball. I was in 
good condition to be a human being. I just wasn't in good condition to do my 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Hadn't you trained extremely hard during the off-season the last couple of 
years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, and it really served me well. But this past summer, I, well, I did 
stuff, but the fire just wasn't there. I suppose I was taking a breather from 
the whole ordeal of the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Just to be certain, is there even a remote chance of your coming back next 
season? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Any chance of your not finishing this season? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nothing foreseeable. Of course if I get injured, it could finish me, but 
other than that, I'll be out there. 
</P>
<P>
The farewell tour of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar continues. To those who say he is 
already done, he simply says, wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers can still be a dominant team, with the people we presently have," 
Abdul-Jabbar said. "We at least deserve the benefit of the doubt, myself 
included." 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's 21-point cakewalk over the Cavaliers, everybody in the Laker 
locker room was talking about how much better Kareem seemed, how good he looked 
out there. Magic said it first. Riley said it next. They saw some of the old 
Abdul-Jabbar out there, they said, and even Kareem, while conceding that he has 
"got a ways to go," acknowledged that it was nice to make a contribution to a 
Laker victory. 
</P>
<P>
He had scored 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Life with the Lakers had certainly changed. The simple fact that their regal 
old center had finally made his presence felt, had shown some of his old zeal, 
had snatched several rebounds and done more than taken up space, had been 
enough to inspire hopefulness, had been so encouraging that it disguised, to 
some, the actual news of the day, that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, king of the court, 
had just been told that he had to start playing better or else he would have to 
be benched. 
</P>
<P>
With luck, that day won't come. 
</P>
<P>
Have a nice season, I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to do that," Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said.

CALCAVECCHIA TAKES LEAD AFTER ROLLING ANOTHER 67 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia shot a 67 Saturday to become the fourth leader in as many 
days in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who also had 67s Thursday and Friday, said: "That's a good number 
to get stuck on, but I don't know if it will be good enough tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Today, at Bermuda Dunes, the host course, the pros will leave their amateur 
partners behind for the final 18-hole shootout of the 90-hole tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has a 72-hole total of 272, 16 under par. However, Paul Azinger, 
Steve Jones, Tom Kite and Sandy Lyle are only 2 strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
Seven players are at 275, including Fred Couples, Bernhard Langer, Brad Bryant 
and Scott Verplank. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the first tournament of the PGA Tour last week, the Tournament 
of Champions at La Costa, shot his way back into contention with a 
course-record 63 at Eldorado. 
</P>
<P>
After he shot 76 on the first day on the wind-blown Palmer PGA West course, he 
said he was ready to return to his home in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really played well here. I've made the cut only once out of four 
times," Jones said. He got back to even par on the second day and kept 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
Jones broke a record previously shared by Arnold Palmer, Bo Wininger and Don 
Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
Starting from the 10th hole, Jones had 2 eagles on his round. A 1-iron shot and 
a 12-foot putt gave him his first eagle on No. 1. Then, on the ninth hole, he 
hit an 8-iron to the green and sank a 15-foot putt. He also had 5 birdies in 
his round. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played well all week, even though I had 3 double bogeys the first day 
when the wind was blowing hard on the Palmer course," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The wind subsided Saturday on a clear, mild day in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, 28, a long-hitter from West Palm Beach, Fla., played at Indian 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
"I screwed up the 3 par-5 holes, as I was only 1 under on them, but I made some 
long putts," Calcavecchia said. "I'm just happy to be leading." 
</P>
<P>
He made a 25-foot putt on the first hole for a birdie, then rolled in a 
50-footer on No. 2 for another birdie, both par 4s. He birdied the par-5, 
517-yard fifth hole and got another birdie on No. 9, a par-4 hole, with a sand 
wedge and 1-foot putt. He had only 1 birdie on the back side, though, a 4-foot 
putt at the 354-yard 16th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was disappointed in not lowering his score on the par-5 holes 
Saturday, he noted that he is 11 under on the par 5s this week, concluding: 
"There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia was sixth on the money list last year, earning $751,912. If his 
lead holds up here, he'll get a first-prize check of $180,000 out of a total 
purse of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who shot a 69 at Bermuda Dunes, said he didn't get as much out of his 
round as he should have. 
</P>
<P>
"I finished on a sour note with a bogey at 17 (a par-3 hole)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had a bogey on the par-4, 418-yard second hole but compensated with 5 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Kite is repeatedly asked about not winning a tournament in 1988 after winning 
at least one tournament in 7 previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the potential of winning 4 tournaments last year, and I was only 1 shot 
away from being the leading money-winner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his playoff loss to Curtis Strange in the Nabisco 
Championship last November, the winner getting a check for $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Kite won $760,405 as the fifth leading money-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger says he has played well in the desert in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had a solid week here," said Azinger, who shot 67 at the Palmer PGA 
West Course. "I had a humbling experience in the Tournament of Champons, when I 
was dead last after the first two rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Schulz, who shot a 69 at Palmer PGA West, is among a group that is only 3 
strokes off the lead. He is not a prominent player, as he got into the 
tournament on a sponsor's exemption this week and played on the Asian tour last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has local knowledge, since he worked as manager of the driving 
range at Bermuda Dunes in 1983 and part of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't shagging balls, he played the course and said that he shot 63 a 
few times in casual rounds at Bermuda Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
Now he'll get an opportunity for a low score today on the same course under 
tournament conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Langer, who shot a 69 at Palmer PGA West and is in a group at 275, 
said he hasn't played since early December. "I've been resting and went home to 
West Germany for the holidays," he said. Langer, the 1985 Masters champion who 
was troubled with back problems in 1988, said: "It was probably the worst year 
of my life, health-wise." He is feeling reasonably fit now, even though his 
back stiffens on him in cold weather. "I know I can win out here," he said. 
"It's just a case of getting it together." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Pate, a former UCLA star who had a 62 Friday, including a hole-in-one, 
had a a 69 at El Dorado for a 4-day total of 283, 11 strokes off the lead. . . 
. Dave Edwards shot a 63 at Palmer PGA West and missed the cut by a stroke. The 
cut was 285.

BRUINS FOUND WANTING IN SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS -- AND IRISH WIN, 82-79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If that was a "report-card" game Saturday for the UCLA basketball team, as 
Coach Jim Harrick told his players, give the Bruins low marks for bench 
strength, rebounding and ability to hold a lead. 
</P>
<P>
Also give Harrick a failing grade for creativity. 
</P>
<P>
How else can one dismiss Harrick's contention, however veiled, that fatigue 
from Thursday night's last-second victory over USC might have contributed to a 
nationally televised 82-79 loss to Notre Dame? 
</P>
<P>
The Irish, after all, had been on the road since Jan. 2, and 8 of their players 
reportedly came down with food poisoning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the Irish, in front of a hostile crowd of 11,847, overcame a 13-point 
deficit in the first half and then an 8-point deficit in the last 10 minutes to 
saddle UCLA with its first loss this season at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who have lost 3 of 6 games since beating Stanford last month, are 
9-4. Notre Dame improved to 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame put together a 12-1 spurt after falling behind, 63-55, with 9 
minutes 44 seconds left, and when UCLA made only one shot in a decisive stretch 
of more than 7 minutes, the Irish increased their lead to 74-69. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a tough game the other night," Harrick said. "It was a late game and a 
tough game. That might have showed." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, had a chance to pull even at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins trailed, 80-77, when freshman Darrick Martin, unable to get the ball 
to Pooh Richardson, missed a 3-point shot with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind him shooting it except that he was covered," Harrick said. "I 
would have rather (he) passed it and got an open shot." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick would have rather seen a lot of things happen differently in a loss 
that he believed could have easily been averted. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame outrebounded UCLA, 38-19, pulling down 18 on the offensive end, and 
the Irish bench outscored UCLA's, 19-8. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of that was our lackadaisical attitude," UCLA's Trevor Wilson 
said of the glaring disparity in rebounds. "We didn't play real good help-side 
defense and we got caught in a bad position a lot. That allowed them to get a 
lot of easy shots." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who led the Pacific 10 Conference in rebounding last season as a 
sophomore, had only 2 rebounds, his lowest total since he also had only 2 
against Wyoming in the last game of his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's starting front line of Wilson, Don MacLean and Kevin Walker got only 12 
rebounds; front-line reserves Charles Rochelin and Keith Owens contributed only 
1 each. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Notre Dame's Keith Robinson, making only his second start, had 18 
points and 9 rebounds, and freshman LaPhonso Ellis played his best game of the 
season, making 12 of 16 shots, scoring a game-high 24 points and grabbing 13 
rebounds, including 6 on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big, he's strong and he attacks the basket aggressively," Pooh Richardson 
said of the 6-foot 9-inch, 238-pound Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
The implication, of course, was that UCLA did not. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bruins shot out to a 21-10 lead as Walker scored all of his 13 
points in the first 9 1/2 minutes, making 4 of 4 shots, including 3 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA increased its lead to 35-22 on a pair of driving layups by Martin, who 
also finished with 13 points. But after a wrap-around pass by Martin resulted 
in a turnover, Harrick pulled the freshman guard. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidently or not, Notre Dame then scored 11 straight points as UCLA turned 
the ball over 4 of 5 times down the court. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the spurt was a jumper by freshman Elmer Bennett, who had 10 points 
and 3 assists off the bench, and a 3-point play by reserve forward Kevin 
Ellery, who made 3 of 4 shots and scored 7 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the guys who lit the spark," Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps said of 
Bennett and Ellery. "I just thought we hit them with people they didn't expect 
to be on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids this morning, 'Our first 10 players are better than their 
first 10 players, and that's what's going to win for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Irish caught and passed the Bruins early in the second half, but a 9-0 run 
by UCLA put the Bruins back ahead, 63-55, with 9:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing 12-1 spurt by Notre Dame, Robinson scored 8 points, and 
MacLean, who led UCLA with 18 points, missed a driving layup that, had it gone 
in, might have stalled the Irish momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," Harrick said, sounding very much like a father who had 
expected his kids to bring home better grades. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps would still like to play UCLA twice each season, 
and he met this week with UCLA officials to discuss the possibility. However, 
Athletic Director Peter Dalis of UCLA said it was "improbable" that the Bruins 
would agree to such an arrangement. Said Dalis, amused by Phelps' annual 
request for a second game: "Tell Digger we'll play him twice if he joins the

<P>
Portland is 1-14 overall and 1-1 in the West Coast Athletic Conference. San 
Diego fell to 5-9 and 0-2 after its fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Koenitzer made 2 baskets, including a 5-foot turnaround jumper with 1:30 
left that put the Pilots ahead for good, 55-54.

UTAH STATE DEFENSE TOO TOUGH FOR SANTA BARBARA

<P>
Chris Sheehan came off the bench to score 7 points with less than 5 minutes 
left in the game to help Utah State score a 78-65 victory over previously 
undefeated UC Santa Barbara Saturday night at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (5-9 overall, 3-2 in the Big West) used a swarming defense to hold 
Santa Barbara to 34% shooting for the game as the Gauchos fell to 11-1 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies held Santa Barbara to just 4 points in the first 8 minutes of the 
game to build a 19-4 lead. Reid Newey, who scored 19 points, made 3 3-point 
shots during the run. The Gauchos battled back within 27-17, but a 9-0 run by 
the Aggies put them ahead, 36-17, with 8:29 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Santa Barbara went on a 12-2 run, keyed by Gary Gray's 6 
points, as the Gauchos cut the lead to 53-45 with 8:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific 75, New Mexico State 70 -- Reggie Ricks made a 30-foot 3-point shot 
with 33 seconds left to lead the Tigers past the Aggies at Stockton and end 
their 26-game conference losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
UOP (5-7, 1-3) had 4 players in double figures, led by Ricks with 15. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico (9-6, 2-3), got most of its offense from Johnnie Roberson, who 
scored 23 points. Roberson scored 17 points in the first half to put the Aggies 
ahead, 46-38, at halftime. But he was shut down in the second half, attempting 
just 1 shot for 2 points as the Aggies were outscored, 37-24.

BRUNDY HELPS CARRY DEPAUL PAST LOYOLA; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER CRENSHAW STAR HAS 41 POINTS, 23 REBOUNDS IN 122-108 VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the numbers were in Loyola Marymount's favor Saturday in its game 
against DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions hit 13 3-pointers, outrebounded the Blue Demons, 52-47, and produced 
a 66-point second half. But DePaul was able to contain Hank Gathers while 
Loyola was unable to stop Stanley Brundy as the Blue Demons beat the Lions, 
122-108, before a crowd of 9,656 at the Rosemont Horizon and a national 
television audience. 
</P>
<P>
Brundy, the former Crenshaw High School star, had 41 points and 23 rebounds as 
DePaul improved its record to 123-15 at the Horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, meanwhile, was triple-teamed the entire game and finished with a 
hard-fought 26 points, his season low, and 14 rebounds. Gathers, who was 
averaging 34.5 points a game, made 9 of 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul's point total set a school record. Even more impressive was the Blue 
Demons' foul shooting, normally 61%. DePaul made 31 of 39 free throws (79%), 
including its last 18, to hold off a determined Loyola charge. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions shot only 38% for the game and hit only 15 field goals in the first 
half. They trailed by as many as 21 points and were down, 58-42, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But their press proved effective in the second half, and, behind the long-range 
shooting of guards Jeff Fryer and Enoch Simmons, they cut the lead to 64-58 
less than 5 minutes into the half, and moved to within 96-94 with 4:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Blue Demons held off Loyola down the stretch, hitting all their free 
throws and getting several baskets by breaking Loyola's press. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer finished with a career-high 42 points, hitting 9 of 14 shots from 3-point 
range. Simmons added 27 points, with 4 3-pointers. But Gathers, Simmons and 
Fryer accounted for all but 13 of Loyola's points. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul had five players in double figures, with point guard Terence Greene 
getting 20 points and 11 assists, and reserve guard Chuckie Murphy adding 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul Coach Joey Meyer said he knew his team's first-half lead wasn't safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord knows you've got to keep scoring, because they will," Meyer said. "In the 
second half, defensively, they turned it up a couple notches. We would 
(normally) never play that fast, but they make you play that pace." 
</P>
<P>
When the teams met here 3 weeks ago in the DePaul tournament (with DePaul 
winning, 115-111), Gathers scored 32. Meyer was concerned enough Saturday to 
have three -- and sometimes four -- players swarming on Gathers. The Blue 
Demons blocked a season-high 13 shots, as Brundy and 7-foot center James Hamby 
hounded the 6-7 Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said: "I told Hamby, 'Wait for him at the free-throw line, hedge to his 
left and contest the shot.' It worked well. We collapsed well, maybe too much. 
That left their outside shooters open. Unfortunately, Fryer went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Lion Coach Paul Westhead said he told Gathers at halftime that if he was triple 
teamed, to "pass it off or take all three to the hole. I wouldn't ever tell him 
to back down. The third (defensive) player was a new dimension for him. It was 
a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
And how much does Brundy enjoy playing the Lions? "I wish I could play them 
every game," the 6-foot-7 senior forward said with a grin. Brundy had 47 points 
and 20 rebounds the last time the teams played. 
</P>
<P>
"That style allows him to use his quickness. I guess I expected him to have 
another big game," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead noted: "We held him below 47." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's record dropped to 8-6, whereas DePaul improved to 10-7. Loyola has won 
6 of its last 8 games, with both losses coming at DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our guys for sure would make a run," Westhead said. "To DePaul's 
credit, they made all their fouls coming down to the end. They made some big 
plays when the game was in the 90s. That was the key."

FRESNO STATE EDGES CS LONG BEACH

Cal State Long Beach had just lost a 1-point game at one of the toughest places 
to win in the Big West Conference, but Coach Joe Harrington had no praise for 
his 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We stunk," Harrington said after Fresno State escaped with a 56-55 victory 
when a close-in shot by 49er Marco Fleming missed with 5 seconds to play 
Saturday night at Selland Arena. "I'm not proud of the way we played. I can't 
think of one good thing about this game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, with the chance to win here for the first time in 6 seasons, 
controlled the ball with 23 seconds left after Jervis Cole's free throw had 
given Fresno the lead. They worked the ball around, finally getting it into 
Fleming, who had tied the score at 55-55 with a hook shot 39 seconds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I got it down in the blocks, saw the middle was open, took a drop step and 
shot," Fleming said of the last shot. 
</P>
<P>
The ball hit the backboard, rolled around the rim and came out into the hands 
of Fresno's Derrick Barden, who had been defending against Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them during the timeout that if they got caught behind Fleming that 
Fleming is not a great jumper," Fresno Coach Ron Adams said. "We tried to get 
up on the shot and just go straight up, and Derrick did. It was a great 
pressure play." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which came back after trailing for most of the first half, made the 
game close despite off-nights by John Hatten, who had 6 points, and Darrell 
Faulkner, who had none. Both had been averaging almost 13 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who was particularly displeased with Faulkner, said, "I'm going to 
sit him down the next game." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat ended a 3-game winning streak for the 49ers, who are 6-8 overall and 
3-2 in the Big West. Fresno is 8-5, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
After making only 33% of their shots in the first half, the 49ers hit 52% in 
the second half. With their press clicking, they scored the first 10 points of 
the final half to take a 35-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was ahead, 50-44, with 6:52 left. But then Fresno -- and its crowd 
of 10,039 -- got back in the game. The Bulldogs scored the next 11 points, 4 
each by Cole and Bijou Baly. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-point shot by Tyrone Mitchell and Fleming's hook tied it, but Cole, who led 
the Bulldogs with 17 points, made the second of 2 free throws after being 
fouled by Rudy Harvey while shooting from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's defense and clutch shooting, especially by Jeff Eastin, who hit 3 
3-point shots and led the 49ers with 13 points, impressed Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the kind of team you can throw out the percentages when you play," 
Adams said. "They've been shooting 42% (this season), but you watch them in 
given games and Eastin is hitting 3-point shots. I think they're almost a 
better team than last (season), and it's not from a standpoint of personnel. 
They're pressing better and I think they played with a lot of intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, though, begged to differ. "Horrible," is how he put it.

Betsy King shot a 3-under-par 68 Saturday and moved into a 7-stroke lead after 
2 rounds of a $500,000 Ladies Professional Golf Assn. tournament at Sandy Bay, 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
King, who shot a 64 in the opening round, has a 2-day total of 10-under-par 
132. Second-place Nancy Lopez, who had an opening-round 69, shot a 70 for a 139 
total. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really playing well," Lopez said. "I feel good about the final round. Most 
of the tournaments that I have won I came from behind, so I have been in this 
position many times before." 
</P>
<P>
Hollis Stacy held third place with a second-round 71 and a 140 total. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-hole tournament on the par-71, 6,292-yard Tryall Golf and Beach Club 
concludes today with the winner taking home $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
There was a four-way tie for fourth place at 141 among Danielle Ammaccapane, 
Nancy Brown, Robin Walton and Lori Garbacz. 
</P>
<P>
King: "I really don't feel like I have hit the ball that well this week. But I 
have read the greens real well which is the key here because they can be very 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez birdied the first hole from 8 feet but 3-putted on the second from 30 
feet. She also needed 3 putts on the 12th and 14th holes, resulting in bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 3-putted 6 times in the 2 rounds," Lopez said. "I have a tendency to 
putt too aggressively in the early part of the season and that leaves me four 
and five footers coming back. Those are just the kind of putts you don't want. 
With the wind blowing, it is hard to keep your body still over the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Strange, U.S. Open champion and the first man to win $1 million on the 
PGA Tour, shot a 1-under-par 71 for a 2-stroke lead in the third round of the 
$525,000 Palm Meadows Cup tournament at Gold Coast, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Strange's 54-hole total was 207. Raymond Floyd and Australian Terry Price each 
shot a 70 and were tied for second at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Isao Aoki and Australia's Peter Fowler were next at 210. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman of Australia shot a 73 and was far back at 216.

<P>
Welcome to summer at Flinders Park, the home of the Australian Open Tennis 
Championships. In the next 2 weeks, the world's best players will try to finish 
on top Down Under in the first Grand Slam event of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the first round, electricity is in the air. Players are bustling 
about, making last-minute adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hovering over the practice desk, Yannick Noah seeks a vacant spot on the 
heavily booked practice sheet. Practice time is in demand as many of the 252 
participants try to relieve pre-tournament jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four persons share a court for 45 minutes during the practice, so Gabriela 
Sabatini of Argentina makes a mad dash for her court to avoid the risk of being 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the draw sheet, Soviet players nervously scan for their name and their 
first-round opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kerry Anne Guse, a 16-year-old wild-card entry, wanders in disbelief after 
being told she will face top-seeded Steffi Graf of West Germany in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A subdued Stefan Edberg politely stops to sign autographs before heading 
for the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Tony Roche is on the the sidelines offering last-minute advice to 
Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Electricians are high over the stadium for a final check on the retractable 
roof, a feature that would serve Wimbledon well. 
</P>
<P>
The season's first Grand Slam is ready to begin, and its status has risen 
dramatically in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Once, it was difficult to attract overseas players here. 
</P>
<P>
The prize money was small, the fast Melbourne grass was unfavorable to many 
competitors, and a 24-hour flight was burdensome for players who wanted to be 
closer to their families during the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
An increase in prize money, a new site and new dates have turned the tournament 
into a Grand Slam comparable to its counterparts -- the French Open, Wimbledon 
and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The $2,400,000 in prize money makes the long trip worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the U.S. Open relocated from the old site of Forest Hills, N.Y., to 
Flushing Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, this tournament made a similar type of move. It left the elite Kooyong 
Tennis Club for the $70-million facility near the heart of Melbourne. It may be 
one of the world's great tennis centers -- at least the players think so. 
</P>
<P>
Rain is no longer a concern here. Graf's final against Chris Evert last year 
was delayed by rain with the score, 6-1, 2-1, then was continued under the 
retractable roof. The closing of the roof may have been more exciting than the 
final as fans sat in the rain to watch the gap of dark sky disappear in 23 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The lights came on, the water was mopped off the court, and the match became 
the first Grand Slam final played indoors. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years of playing, I never thought I'd find myself competing on melted 
rubber tires. Sounds like something from a run-down neighborhood park, but it 
is the official surface here. And this innovation, called Rebound Ace, was 
applauded by the players last year. 
</P>
<P>
You would have expected some flaws when running an event at a new complex, but 
last year's tournament went smoothly. I never heard a player complain and a lot 
of them now prefer to compete here than anywhere else outside of England and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Wilander and Edberg, the two who have dominated the Australian 
Championships in the last 5 years, think so. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, a three-time Australian Open winner and defending champion, is the 
odds-on favorite. Wilander, the world's No. 1-ranked player, will be hard put 
to upstage a brilliant 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker may have the best chance of unseating Wilander. Becker has been 
playing well lately. He won the Masters tournament to end last season, and led 
West Germany to a Davis Cup victory over Sweden in December. Becker has been 
working with Australian coach Bob Brett for the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl also arrived early this year. He has prepared intensely in the seclusion 
of Roche's resort outside of Sydney, and views this tournament as his first 
step toward recapturing the No. 1-ranking he lost to Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"If if did not expect to win, I would not have come down here," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be too surprised by Australia's Darren Cahill, Mark Woodforde and Jason 
Stolenberg, who played well at the U.S. Open last year. If they can withstand 
the publicity of playing at home, they could revive Australia's strong tennis 
tradition of the John Newcombe, Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall era. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian leader, however, is 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, who is 
coming off a 4-month layoff from injury. He lost last year's final to Wilander. 
Although he has a much-improved serve, he may lack the match practice needed to 
challenge here. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, perhaps the Americans will shine the way the Australians did in 
last year's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
The Flinders Park surface will certainly favor some of the hard-hitting 
Americans such as Aaron Krickstein and Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
From first-hand experience, I also cannot overlook the possibility of young 
up-and-comers who could possibly gain a major upset. A few years ago, I played 
a 14-year-old West German, ranked No. 180 at the time, in a qualifying match at 
Australia. I lost, 7-6, 6-4, and left the court infuriated, depressed and 
disappointed that I could lose to an unknown player 9 years my junior. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Steffi Graf would emerge from the shadows of obscurity to achieve her 
current status as the world's No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
Today, I would be elated with such a close match. 
</P>
<P>
So, although it is not easy to predict the men's winner, Graf appears to be the 
overwhelming women's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who won the four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold medal last 
year, has been so dominant that the real question perhaps is who will reach the 
final against her. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, who could become the world's No. 2 player, has proven she is not 
intimidated by Graf. Sabatini and Graf potentially will meet in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova also is back this year. I can't forget last year's 
second-round match in which she defeated me on court No. 1. I was unintimidated 
before walking onto the court, but that feeling soon dwindled after finding 
Martina a few times stronger and faster than I had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
But now the tournament is about to begin, and anticipation is high. They all 
want to be the man and the woman who will raise the coveted trophies in the 
end.

GRAF LOOKS TOUGH, BUT LENDL MAY BE IN TOUGH

<P>
The $1.5-million Australian Open, where it all began for Steffi Graf and where 
it has never happened for Ivan Lendl, begins Monday on the hard playing 
surfaces at the National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
Graf should feel right at home. This is where she started banging her forehand 
last year, on the way to winning the Grand Slam. When she got here, stepping 
off the plane from West Germany after a 28-hour flight, Graf said she felt no 
pressure to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done and achieved everything I can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The same cannot be said for Lendl, who has never won the Australian and has 
played in the final only once. Lendl lost to Mats Wilander in 1983, but that 
was on another surface, the grass courts at Kooyong. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, the Australian Open said so long to Kooyong and moved to 
the National Tennis Center at Flinders Park, which features the Rebound Ace 
hard-court surface. Wilander defeated Pat Cash in the final and went on to win 
2 other Grand Slam events, the French Open and the U.S. Open, replacing Lendl 
as No. 1 in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Across the international dateline, it may prove more difficult to know what day 
it is for Wilander and Graf than to win in the early going. Think of it this 
way: It's tomorrow right now Down Under but 5 hours earlier than it is in Los 
Angeles. Thus, if it's noon Sunday in Los Angeles, it's 7 a.m. Monday here. 
</P>
<P>
Sound simple? Consider the first-round opponents that Wilander and Graf drew. 
Wilander, the top-seeded player, opens against Tobias Svantesson, who is ranked 
95th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Graf plays Australian Kerry Anne Guse in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked second in the world, plays a qualifier in the first round, and if 
the seedings hold true, will face 10th-seeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel in the 
fourth round, which is where the 2-week tournament really begins with its 
toughest matches. 
</P>
<P>
If the seedings hold up, Wilander will face his first serious test against 
15th-seeded John Fitzgerald of Australia in the fourth round. Ninth-seeded 
Miloslav Mecir should meet eighth-seeded Yannick Noah, third-seeded Boris 
Becker should play 14th-seeded Jonas B. Svensson and 12-seeded Mikael Pernfors 
should play sixth-seeded Henri Leconte. 
</P>
<P>
Barring upsets, the fourth round also marks the beginning of difficulties for 
players in the bottom half of the draw. Cash, 13th-seeded, would meet 
fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg. Other fourth-round matches would include 
fifth-seeded Jakob Hlasek against 11th-seeded Thomas Muster and seventh-seeded 
John McEnroe against 10th-seeded Aaron Krickstein. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova, seeded second behind Graf, plays Andrea Betzner of West 
Germany in the first round and third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini plays Ceclia 
Dahlman of Sweden. Graf figures to meet Sabatini in the semifinals. In the 
bottom half of the draw, Navratilova should play fourth-seeded Pam Shriver in 
the other semifinal.

Martina Navratilova, tuning up for this week's Australian Open, advanced to the 
finals in singles and doubles in the New South Wales Open tennis tournament on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Navratilova, of Ft. Worth, Tex., defeated No. 9 Hana Mandlikova 
of Australia, 6-3, 6-2, and will play Sweden's Catarina Lindqvist in today's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist advanced by defeating Terry Phelps of Larchmont, N.Y., in the other 
semifinal, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
In doubles, Navratilova and regular partner Pam Shriver, the No. 1-seeded team, 
defeated the unseeded team of Iwona Kuczynska of Poland and Judith Weisner of 
Austria, 6-3, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova and Shriver will face Liz Smylie and Wendy Turnbull of Australia, 
who advanced past Ann Henricksson and Gretchen Magers of the United States, 
6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles semifinals, Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union defeated 
Olivier Delaitre of France, 7-5, 6-1, and third-seeded Aaron Krickstein of

NEW CIF PLAYOFF PLAN DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he learned that the CIF Southern Section was revamping its 1988-89 playoff 
format for boys' and girls' basketball teams to move in step with the state's 
system, which is based on enrollment, El Monte High Coach John Gillette 
couldn't believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
For Gillette's team, which has struggled in recent seasons since reaching the 
Southern Section 2-A Division final in 1985, it resulted in a giant leap up 
from 2-A to 5-A. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the reasoning behind it -- getting in line with the rest of the state," 
he said. "But I can't believe it. Hey, we have the largest section in the 
state. Why don't they get in line with us?" 
</P>
<P>
But Don Holbrook of Los Altos, whose girls' team moved up from 3-A to 4-A, saw 
the change in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was about time," he said. "I think it's the only way you can do the 
playoffs so you're competing against teams your own size. I wish they'd do it 
for the leagues, too." 
</P>
<P>
Added St. Monica Coach Leo Klemm, whose boys' team dropped from 5-A to 2-A but 
opted to move up to 5-AA: "I think (with) any change you're going to affect a 
lot of people. But for the most part, people are going to benefit by the 
change. . . . In the long run, I think it's a good change." 
</P>
<P>
Under the change, the top three teams in each league (or two in a five-team 
league) are placed in one of nine playoff divisions based on enrollment. Teams 
with winning percentages of .500 or more can also be considered for a playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section 5-AA and 5-A will compete in Division I at the state 
level; 4-AA and 4-A in Division II; 3-A in Division III; 2-AA and 2-A in 
Division IV and 1-A and Small Schools in Division V. Divisions for all-boys and 
all-girls schools are determined by doubling the school's enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Crowley, associate commissioner of athletics for the Southern Section, 
said the CIF had been discussing the possibility of a format change before it 
was approved by the Southern Section's board of governors last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"The state has gone to the enrollment format for the playoffs, and we have 
teams that are smaller in enrollment competing against larger schools in their 
(state) division," Crowley explained. "It doesn't help the big schools because 
the big schools are good at any level. But last year we had no team (from the 
Southern Section) in the state playoffs in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
"We were losing good teams from the tournament. We had no one in Division III 
and very few in Division IV and V (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said that in the long run, the format change will benefit Southern 
Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, it's going to allow some of the smaller schools to 
get into the state tournament," he said. "We're the largest section in the 
state, with over 500 schools, and we're the only one playing by division. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have a state championship in California, I would say we should go 
back to the old classification system. But under the circumstances, with state 
championships being conducted by enrollment, I think this is the fairest way to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound fair to most coaches, but not everybody is enamored of the new 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can use just one criterion, such as enrollment, as a playoff 
basis," said Alhambra's Jim Wetmore, whose boys' team steps up from 3-A to 
5-AA. "We have a lot of Asians here, and we have only one player over 5-11 on 
our squad. . . . I don't think we're really a 5-AA school, but we have no 
choice in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people who made this (change) walked around our campus, I think they'd 
be amazed. We're a school of 3,300, but you should see our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gillette: "What the CIF didn't take into account is we're 5-A in 
enrollment, but where do we draw our talent from? . . . I thought the idea of 
divisions was meant to be equitable by talent. Now it's done in a way that 
looks fair but it really isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had this format in place a few years ago, we would have never made it to 
the (Southern Section) finals. . . . You start pairing us with teams like 
Capistrano Valley, Ocean View and Lakewood -- give us a break. I think you've 
effectively eliminated a 2-A type of school from winning the title." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said the format will almost certainly create numerous mismatches in 
the early rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Say we finish third in our league and now we have to move up to play Mater Dei 
in the first round," he said. "Holy cow! You're going to see some real blowouts 
in the playoffs. At least on paper it would appear there's a chance for a lot 
of blowouts throughout the championships." 
</P>
<P>
Wetmore doesn't think his team has much of a chance if it makes the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it," he said. "If we go up against a team that goes say 
6-7, 6-7 and 6-6 across, how are we going to go up against them? We played 
Pasadena in a non-league game and they beat us by 30 points, and they're a 
division below us (5-A)." 
</P>
<P>
The new system gave coaches the opportunity to move up to a higher enrollment 
division but not to a lower one for the playoffs. By last week's filing 
deadline, 15 boys' teams and five girls' teams had decided to move to a higher 
division for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial power St. Bernard was one of the schools that decided for a higher 
division, moving from 3-A to 5-AA. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Bernard has only 600 boys, so we should match up against teams of about 
the same size," Coach Jim McClune said. "All things being equal, that's how it 
should be, but all things aren't equal. We just happen to have a good 
basketball team. We've made the CIF 5-A semifinals about four times in the last 
eight years, so we've been pretty successful at that level. So we're 
comfortable with that for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Klemm of St. Monica pointed to the same reason for the Mariners moving up to 
5-AA for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to play at the 5-AA level even though we are a small school 
because we feel we are competitive at that level," he said. "We were already 
playing at the 5-AA level (5-A last year). For another team it might have been 
another thing." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said that for his team, under the new format, it wouldn't make much 
difference what division he chose. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking maybe it would be more beneficial to move up to the 5-AA 
because it looked (at first) like there were a few less good teams there," he 
said. "But what difference is it going to make? At any level, I can't see us or 
any schools like us going very far under this format." 
</P>
<P>
Wetmore said schools should have the option of moving down for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If a team can move up, a team should be able to move down, too," he said. "It 
should be a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches also think that allowing schools with .500 records or better to 
make the playoffs as at-large teams will encourage schools in tougher leagues 
to play easier non-league schedules. 
</P>
<P>
But Klemm doesn't think that would be beneficial. "Our philosophy is always to 
schedule the best opponents," he said. "When you don't do that, you're going 
against yourself. A person can schedule that way, but I think you suffer for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said the new format will stay in effect for at least the next two 
seasons, although he said that it is not permanent by any means. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about staying this way, but this is not etched in stone," Crowley 
said. "We will go with playoffs by enrollment this year and next year. We will 
poll the schools in January or February of next year about whether they want to 
stay in this format. If a large majority says, 'Stay with it,' we'll keep it, 
and if not, we can try another option. 
</P>
<P>
"Playoff groupings are on a two-year cycle, so this is the way it will be the 
next two years." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, for one, is hoping that the new format doesn't last any longer than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way it's going to be this particular year, but I would have to 
imagine that if there's enough noise something could be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the moment, like it or not, it is something that he will have to live 
with.

WARRIORS BLOW LEAD BUT NIP NO. 1 CERRITOS AT END, 82-80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino struggled to pull out a 82-80 victory Saturday against top-ranked 
Cerritos in probably the Warriors' most exciting game this season. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 seconds left to play and the game tied, freshman Kelvin Harris hit a 
turnaround jumper for the win. 
</P>
<P>
"Cerritos is a great team," said El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "They have a 
lot of desire to win, and they made our guys make lots of mistakes. They made 
our guys get out of what they're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 14 Warriors (18-5, 3-0) held the lead for most of the physical contest, 
which included lots of shoving and elbowing under the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (19-3, 0-2) had already been upset by Pasadena in its South Coast 
Conference opener Wednesday but hoped to beat El Camino and keep its No. 1 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
And since Cerritos had beaten El Camino in double overtime at the Fullerton 
tournament early this season, it expected another victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors however, were determined to change the outcome this time despite 
losing the 9-point lead they held with 1:17 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They almost blew it," McClurkin said of his players. "That's why they're not 
in there jumping up and down and celebrating, because they know they almost 
blew it." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their last two games, the Warriors played an exciting first half with a 
fast-paced offense and an effective full-court trapping defense. 
</P>
<P>
David Keeter hit a 3-pointer and Kevin Mixon sank two free throws to put the 
Warriors up, 28-17, with 6:47 left in the half. But Cerritos came back, cutting 
the lead at intermission to 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
Mixon, a 6-foot-3 sophomore, led the Warriors with 23 points. Harris had 13, 
and Zlatco Josic and Frank Beatty 10 each.

WATER-SKI CHAMP'S FIRST LAKE WAS A LIVING-ROOM RUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM DERMODY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was 2 years old, Brandy Nagle learned about water skiing on the rug in 
her family's front room. Her father, who had fitted skis on her tiny feet, 
would throw his daughter a line and pull her around the room, pretending they 
were gliding over glassy waters and cutting through a white-capped wake. 
</P>
<P>
He'd take her through all the turns and twists and drag her over the rug's 
choppy surface, simulating the sounds of a boat's motor. About a year later, 
Brandy was behind the family boat, towline in hand, perched on a surfboard as 
the craft idled in a peaceful cove. 
</P>
<P>
"That way she got comfortable being in the water and hearing the boat," said 
Tom Nagle, Brandy's father. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Brandy is most comfortable on water skis behind a boat now, and those 
beginnings have spawned a two-time national champion who, among other things, 
excels academically, has been featured on national television sports shows and 
has her sights set on the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Nagle is 13, a decade and 90 miles removed from Canyon Lake, where she learned 
to water ski. But the Miraleste High freshman traces her love for water skiing 
to that front room of a small house on the lake at the mouth of the San Jacinto 
River. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 2 years old and your dad is pulling you around on the rug like 
you're skiing, what's there not to like?" she asks rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
She still likes to water ski, but Brandy's competition probably wishes the 
Palos Verdes teen-ager didn't have such zeal for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Nagle has competed in the national championships since she was 9 and has 
claimed a first-place prize the last two years. In 1987 she was National Junior 
Girls trick champion, and in 1988 she brought home the slalom championship from 
West Palm Beach, Fla. Last year she also earned second place in trick skiing 
and jump skiing, giving her second place in the overall standings. She is 
ranked No. 61 in the world among trick skiers her age. 
</P>
<P>
Water skiing as a competitive sport is broken down into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
Slalom means moving through a course broken up by buoys set at regular 
intervals. Points are awarded as the skier increases speed and shortens the 
towline. The boat can go no faster than 34 m.p.h, but the skiers can reach 
almost 55 m.p.h.because they are covering more distance zigzagging through the 
buoys. 
</P>
<P>
Jump skiing entails skiing onto a ramp in the water and hurtling through the 
air, trying to cover as much distance as possible. Points are awarded for the 
greatest distance. 
</P>
<P>
Trick skiing involves performing turns and twists in the air while being pulled 
by the boat. Scoring is most subjective in this category, and judges are hard 
to find. Therefore, when water skiing is introduced at the 1992 Olympics, 
chances are only slalom and jump will be run. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has excelled in all three categories, Nagles enjoys the freedom 
that trick skiing affords and tries to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
"I like them all pretty much, but trick skiing is my favorite," she said. 
"Slalom and jump get a little repetitive because you're performing the same 
things every time. But each trick ski is different and requires different moves 
every time." 
</P>
<P>
One would assume that with all the rain and chill in the air the last few 
weeks, this would have been a down period for Nagle. Not so. Studying and 
playing on the Miraleste junior varsity soccer team take up most of her time, 
but there's still time for water skiing, regardless of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend the family was again out at Canyon Lake. Nagle wears a "dry suit," 
which ties at the wrists, ankles and neck, on top of a sweat shirt and sweat 
pants. This allows her to ski freely for hours without getting wet. 
</P>
<P>
And there's always work to be done on land. Soccer helps tone and firm the 
lower body, and Nagle will begin weight training in February to develop 
upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the "trick trainer," which, according to Nagle, "is a board and 
bar stool with a swivel that lets you practice your balance." 
</P>
<P>
Balance is important to Nagle, not only in water skiing but in life. She is an 
excellent student, maintaining a 3.75 to 4.0 average in the honors program at 
Miraleste. She is one year ahead of classmates her age. 
</P>
<P>
Her accomplishments have earned her accolades not only from coaches and 
teachers but from the fourth estate as well. She was selected KCOP's TV Sports 
Star of the Week and has been featured on ESPN's Sunkist Kids and Scholastic 
Sports America Honor Roll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous at first when I was going on TV," she said. "But I was 
happy that I got on because it brings some attention to the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Nagle tries to keep all the attention in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a regular person just like everybody else," she said. "I'm just dedicated 
to my sport right now. My friends treat me regular and I treat them regular, 
too, just like it's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Nagle has traveled extensively to compete in water skiing events, and there's a 
trip to Australia on the horizon with the 1990 U.S. junior world team. 
</P>
<P>
But the plum hangs in Barcelona, and Nagle hopes to reach for it all in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nagle said he once feared that his daughter would get burned out from doing 
so much. But he now believes that Brandy is following the right path. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have her busy than idle," he said. "Plus, she seems to have her 
head on straight. She paces herself well and gets into the competitive nature 
of the activity." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilma Nagle, Brandy's mother: "It's a lot of extra work on her part, but 
she handles it well." 
</P>
<P>
Handling it is no problem for Brandy because her motivation to succeed in the 
sport is simple and succinct: 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot, and I'd be really sad if I gave it 
up."

IN 3RD YEAR, HAWTHORNE MAKES ITS PRESENCE FELT IN GIRLS' SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rob Fernas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hawthorne High School started a girls' soccer program two years ago, Coach 
Jim Stone admittedly didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real excited at first," said Stone, who had been a successful coach 
in Hawthorne's American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO). "I was used to 
drafting my own teams and knowing I had talent. I wasn't sure I would enjoy 
coaching a team that might have a hard time winning." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Stone, that's never been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
With the 25-year-old coach at the helm, Hawthorne has never come close to 
suffering a losing season. In fact, with a three-year record of 47-9-8, the 
Cougars boast one of the South Bay's winningest programs, breaking into the 
upper echelon of girls' soccer that had previously been occupied by Torrance 
and Peninsula schools. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team, led by several players who were starters on Hawthorne's 
initial varsity squad in the 1986-87 season, owns the best record (13-1-3) in 
the South Bay and the area's highest ranking (sixth) in the Southern Section 
4-A coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to Hawthorne's rapid rise to success? 
</P>
<P>
Stone explains that the Cougars, although lacking the polished skills of 
players from cities with prestigious club programs, are winning because of a 
dedicated work ethic and a closeness rarely found on high school teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We call ourselves 'The Family,' " he said. "What's made us such a good team is 
that we spend so much time together. We practice over holidays and we try to do 
everything as a team. We don't allow anyone to stretch on their own or run on 
their own. We'll wait at practice until everybody gets there." 
</P>
<P>
The team concept has paid off for the Cougars. They moved into undisputed first 
place in the Bay League on Friday with a 3-0 win over visiting Rolling Hills, 
improving to 3-1, a half-game ahead of idle Torrance (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne has outscored opponents, 50-11, with nine shutouts. The Cougars' only 
loss came in their league opener at Palos Verdes, a game Stone says will be 
foremost on their minds when they play host to the Sea Kings on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first goal is to win our league," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That goal escaped the Cougars each of the past two seasons, as they took second 
behind Mira Costa in the Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
But this year they are the front-runners, led by a nucleus of players who have 
been varsity starters since they were either freshmen or sophomores. The group 
includes: 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Jennifer Stone. The coach's sister, she has already set a school 
record with 20 goals this season. Her powerful and accurate shots have prompted 
other teams to call her "The Cannon." 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Erica Henderson. Team co-most valuable player last year, she's 
an all-around performer who fits the Cougars' blue-collar style. "She has more 
determination than any player out there," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior defender Jaymie Bradford. Team captain since her freshman year, she 
anchors Hawthorne's vaunted defense. A talented athlete, she was named All-CIF 
in soccer and softball last year. 
</P>
<P>
Senior midfielder Amy Rubin. Counted on to distribute the ball to the team's 
scorers, she has frustrated many players with her fierce, hard-nosed marking. 
"She won't allow the team to lose," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior defender Anna Rubin. Amy's twin sister, she usually draws the opposing 
team's leading scorer. She was named co-most valuable player of the South 
Torrance Holiday Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the team is determined to get past the first round of the CIF 
playoffs. Hawthorne suffered first-round losses on the road each of the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls don't want to settle for just one win the playoffs," he said. "Our 
goal is to play (top-ranked) Mission Viejo. We might get killed, but we want 
the opportunity to play them." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills' 89-88 overtime win over Inglewood on Wednesday night was another 
example of the Titans' uncanny knack for pulling out close games in the four 
years Cliff Warren has been basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
They've become so commonplace, they're known as Cliff-hangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been lucky in life," said Warren, who owns an 81-20 overall mark 
and a 30-1 home record at Rolling Hills. "I really have been fortunate, but it 
helps when you have good players. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams get in a habit of winning, or winning close games. Everytime you win 
one, the percentage of winning the next one gets better. It doesn't get worse. 
And I've been fortunate in always having a guy you can go to when the chips are 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Rolling Hills had two players who excelled in the clutch against 
Inglewood. Senior center John Hardy and junior guard Steve Clover combined for 
28 of the Titans' 30 points in the fourth quarter and overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (13-3 overall, 4-0 in league play) remained tied for first place 
in the Bay League with an 84-66 win over visiting Hawthorne on Friday night. 
The Titans are tied with surprising Torrance (9-5, 4-0), which rallied from an 
11-point halftime deficit on the road to beat Inglewood, 85-75, behind 45 
points from junior guard Rick Robison. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance will visit Rolling Hills at 7:30 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of jersey numbers is to identify the players, but one number has 
become more significant to Neisha Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The senior guard wears No. 22 for Hawthorne's girls basketball team. This isn't 
particularly unusual, until you consider that Williams is averaging 22 points a 
game and, at one point during non-league play, she scored 22 points in four of 
five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll change her number to 33," quipped Hawthorne Coach John Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
Williams went over her average this week, scoring 30 points in a 64-32 win over 
Santa Monica and 42 in a 76-43 victory over Rolling Hills to help the Cougars 
improve to 8-7 overall and 3-1 in the Bay League, one game behind unbeaten 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Center Heidi Burge of Palos Verdes set a school record with 43 points Friday in 
a 94-36 win over Leuzinger. The 6-4 senior also pulled down 23 rebounds and 
blocked 9 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, improved to 
12-3 overall and 4-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' soccer team extended its record to 19-0 Friday with a 1-0 shutout 
over host Leuzinger in a battle for first place in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kaemmerer's second-half goal provided the winning margin as the Sea Kings 
recorded their 16th shutout of the year, the 15th for goaltender Mark 
Antrobius. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes improved to 4-0 in league play, while Leuzinger fell to 2-1.

The Costa Mesa City Council is expected to award a bid Monday for a storm drain 
project on Harbor Boulevard from Wilson to 19th streets. Four of Harbor's six 
lanes would be shut down during the project, which has raised protests from 
local merchants and residents who would like to see the drain pipe be placed 
elsewhere.

MOTHER LION, KITTENS WIN GAME OF STEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever there was a ticklish situation, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
There he was Saturday, wildlife biologist Paul Beier, about to go traipsing 
into thick brush in Caspers Wilderness Park, where he knew for dead certain 
that a mother mountain lion was hiding, possibly with her two strapping 
kittens. 
</P>
<P>
And Beier was going in alone, unarmed and with full knowledge that the mountain 
lions were in all probability gathered around a fresh deer kill -- unanxious 
for company. Beier shrugged and joked, "Well, at least I'll die with my boots 
on." 
</P>
<P>
It happened, however, that the mother lion and her two year-old kittens 
vanished, despite the best efforts of Beier and other members of a state and 
local trapping team. 
</P>
<P>
The team, sponsored by the Orange County Cooperative Mountain Lion Study, had 
set out to hunt down and tranquilize the two kittens and then put radio 
transmitters attached to collars on them so their movements could be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
The kittens' mother and three other adult female mountain lions in the vicinity 
of Caspers Park in southern Orange County have already had collars attached to 
them as part of a 2-year study begun by the county last year after cougars 
attacked two children during 1986. The last lion was caught and "collared" 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The trappers planned to go back out at first light today and continue going 
until they catch the not-so-little siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Now three-quarters grown and weighing between 50 and 85 pounds, the lions need 
to be equipped with transmitters before they leave their mother and wander 
alone out into the wilderness, said Duggin Wroe, a research aide to Beier, who 
is leading the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they leave their mom, good luck finding them," said Wroe, who has also 
researched grizzly bear habits in the Montana high country. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain lion kittens leave their mother at about 14 months, Wroe said. Since 
the two kittens in Caspers Park are almost that age, they could leave anytime, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the kittens apparently are still with their mother, because their 
tracks have appeared together at various places around the park in recent days. 
Confident that the three are still roaming as a family, Orange County study 
teams officials last week called trapper Dave Fjelline of the California 
Department of Fish and Game to help. 
</P>
<P>
Fjelline, who lives in Placer County in Northern California, and his partner, 
Cliff Wylie, drove to Orange County in a battered pickup truck loaded with 
braying hounds. The plan was for the pack of six dogs to be set free to chase a 
lion up a tree once the trappers could get a good handle on the lions' 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
But the hounds never got a chance Saturday because the trappers couldn't get a 
definite fix on the kittens. Although they knew exactly where the mother was 
because of radio transmissions from her collar, the trappers did not want to 
start a dog chase unless they were sure the kittens were with her. 
</P>
<P>
Setting out in a pre-dawn chill of 21 degrees, the trappers roamed in trucks 
throughout the chaparral of the 7,600-acre park and adjoining Rancho Mission 
Viejo. They scanned the dirt roads for fresh cougar tracks and held up a 
portable radio receiver to pinpoint transmissions from the lions' collars. 
</P>
<P>
Although they found no fresh tracks, trappers were tantalized by the days-old 
imprint of lion kittens' paws on a road through the Rancho Mission Viejo 
property. The prints, on the side of the road, had been missed by the chains 
the trappers drag at night so they will know if tracks are new. 
</P>
<P>
Using the hand-held receivers, however, the trappers were able to pinpoint the 
location of the mother lion, known as No. 305 on the radio dial, as well as two 
of the three other collared lions. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the signals, Beier said the three adults were within 5 miles of 
each other, grouped around Caspers Park. In all, there are an estimated two 
dozen mountain lions in the Orange County backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
Since they were only interested in No. 305 and her kittens, the trappers 
ignored the other signals and concentrated on her. According to her radio 
signal, the lion was lurking nearby in a brush-choked ravine on Rancho Mission 
Viejo property, just a few hundred yards from the Caspers Park western 
boundary. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether she was alone. Fjelline speculated that she had 
killed a deer the previous night, and was in the ravine alone tending the 
carcass until she could fetch the kittens. If that was the case, Fjelline said, 
the kittens probably would be brought back to the kill that night. 
</P>
<P>
To test that theory, Fjelline slowly drove to a road below the ravine to look 
for tracks. As he drove, Wylie sat on the hood, scanning the dirt for the 
four-toed prints. The dogs howled their exasperation from beneath a covering in 
the back of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Beier and Wroe, meanwhile, left their truck and began hiking down to the ravine 
to see whether the mother was indeed harboring a fresh kill. Using map and 
compass, they struggled through sage and cactus until they reached a ridge 
directly overlooking a bush from which radio signals were sounding so loudly an 
antenna was not needed to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
The two men separated to try and flush out the big cat. Before venturing down, 
Beier conceded that "whenever I'm poking around a kill, I'm always nervous. She 
could nail me, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that there have been no reports of cougar attacks on wildlife 
researchers -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help Beier's frame of mind that Wroe, who has come face to face with 
equally dangerous grizzly bears, did not answer his call on a two-way radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, Duggin?" Beier inquired, hearing nothing but static in response. "I assume 
he's all right," he said to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wroe was, and soon he could be seen closing in on the lion's hiding place from 
the right. As Beier worked his way in from the left, radio signals showed the 
cougar was stalking quickly away from the men, over the next hill. 
</P>
<P>
Beier and Wroe found no sign of her, the kittens nor a kill. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, when the weary trappers met back in Caspers Park, Fjelline expressed 
no surprise at the cougar's wiliness in eluding her pursuers through the dense 
brush without making a sound. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just like a vapor," he said. "They are the epitome of stealth."

COOPER (26-0) HELPS CANYON CAPTURE TITLE

Zach Cooper of Canyon High School utilized his quickness and finesse to score a 
9-1 victory over Tony Flores of Rio Mesa in 192-pound division final to lead 
the Comanches to the team championship in the Five Counties wrestling 
tournament Saturday at Fountain Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper (26-0) established his domination early as he took a 3-1 lead over 
Flores (28-3) after one period. Cooper then scored two takedowns in the second 
period and one in the third to put the match out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which last won the Five Counties championship in 1987, finished the 
competition with 124 points. Clovis West of Central California finished second 
with 106 points and Poway was third with 105. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado was the second highest Orange County team, finishing 11th with 72 
points. San Clemente was 12th with 71. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids achieved more with less than any team I've ever had," said Canyon 
Coach Gary Bowden, whose wrestlers scored nine pins and a superior decision in 
the first round Friday. "We had only four seeds -- a first, seventh, eighth and 
ninth -- but all our kids wrestled way above their standings. We were hoping to 
get into the top 15 going into this tournament, but our kids really came 
through for us." 
</P>
<P>
In other matches involving Orange County competitors, Rob Langenwalter of 
Esperanza overcame a knee injury he suffered in his semifinal match earlier 
Saturday to score a 2-1 decision over Chris Wilyard of San Clemente (24-1) in 
the 120-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
Langenwalter, who took a 2-0 lead in the second period, limited Wilyard to a 
1-point third-period reversal as he held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the 139-pound division, Heath Sims (29-1) of Woodbridge, last year's state 
132-pound champion, used his superior strength and quickness to pull off a 12-7 
decision over Ralph Olivas (17-3-1) of Clovis. 
</P>
<P>
Sims who has scored 23 of his victories this year on pins, broke a 4-4 tie 
after one period with two takedown maneuvers to take an 8-5 lead at the end of 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
In the 176-pound division, Joe Pastorello (27-0) of Katella overcame a 2-0 
deficit to take a 10-8 overtime decision over Vacaville's Tim Patelzick (32-3).

LOSS OF JOB IN ORANGE COUNTY OFTEN DEVASTATING

Just back from vacation in October, Gil Banfill played the messages on his 
telephone answering machine. A woman from his employer's personnel office asked 
what he wanted to do about his pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill, 53, returned her call and learned that the Irvine computer memory disk 
plant where he worked had been closed the previous week. After 5 years with 
Xidex Corp., his job was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Three months after the plant closing, Banfill is still making the rounds of 
prospective employers. So far, he has received only one offer, a late-night 
factory job paying $6 an hour. Banfill, who made nearly $11 an hour at Xidex, 
turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm out looking, I see others too," Banfill said recently. "When I put in 
an application yesterday, the place was full." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other laid-off workers in Orange County, Banfill is caught in an 
economic squeeze: unable to qualify for jobs that pay as much as he had been 
earning and unable to afford to take the lower-paying jobs for which he 
qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
With its thriving economy and 2.9% unemployment rate -- so low it is considered 
"full employment" by economists -- Orange County has jobs to spare. But many 
are unskilled assembly or service positions paying about $5 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties faced by the Orange County residents classified as unemployed 
and actively looking for work is compounded by the area's escalating housing 
expenses and high cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
According to economists and employment experts, Orange County's unemployed 
typically hunt for 2 or more months in an often unsuccessful effort to find 
comparable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
And in the end, many find themselves sliding down the economic ladder into 
lower-paying, less-skilled positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assistance Program 
</P>
<P>
The plight of the unemployed "is a side of Orange County that you won't see in 
tourist brochures," said Bill Fogarty, who runs a displaced worker assistance 
program for the Orange County Central Labor Council. 
</P>
<P>
Higher-paid manufacturing jobs account for a shrinking percentage of overall 
employment in Orange County, while lower-paid service jobs are proliferating in 
such sectors as retail, hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
What's left of the manufacturing base is shifting from traditional "low-tech" 
assembly jobs to high-tech assembly lines requiring different skills than those 
possessed by many unemployed workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big expansion of jobs in Orange County at both the top and the 
bottom of the pay scales," said Allen J. Scott, a UCLA professor who has 
studied the effects of a changing industrial base in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Many casualties of plant closings are unskilled or semiskilled workers whose 
former jobs paid from $7 to $12 per hour, Scott said. While other jobs may now 
be available, the pay often is too low to allow them to earn a comparable 
living. 
</P>
<P>
During the 12 months ended in June, 1987, the 90,854 jobs posted at EDD offices 
in Orange County offered wages averaging $5.36 an hour. That amounts to $11,149 
a year, or less than the official poverty level of $11,650 for a family of four 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Orange County Social Services Agency, in order for a typical 
welfare family in the county to become self-sufficient, the breadwinner must 
earn at least $7.90 an hour, or $16,432 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch is compounded by Orange County's sky-high housing prices, which have 
increased at a far faster rate than prevailing wages. According to the 
Apartment Assn. of Orange County, average rent for one-bedroom apartments in 
newer complexes is $806 a month, or $9,672 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a special problem in Orange County," said Harriet Fox, assistant 
manager of the EDD office in Santa Ana. "While the price of housing is 
exceptionally high, the growth of service industries such as retail and 
restaurants is creating a lot of low-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Wages paid for many production and assembly positions have been held down in 
part by a huge influx of immigrant labor into Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone coming into the market from a job at $8 an hour is going to have to 
compete with immigrant labor, which often is able to make do with lower wages 
by pooling family incomes and living quarters," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
And in an area where the high cost of living makes two-worker households a 
necessity and savings a luxury, the loss of a job can lead to financial 
disaster more quickly than in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Workers who are obliged to depend on unemployment insurance, which in 
California provides a maximum of $166 a week for up to 26 weeks, often have to 
dip deeply into savings to make ends meet while hunting for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
"Because so many in Orange County are living over their heads, if they lose 
their job they soon will face the bill collector and (then) the loss of their 
homes, cars and families," said Fogarty, the labor council program 
administrator. "It has a domino effect." 
</P>
<P>
The emotional toll of a job loss can be devastating, said Fogarty, who recalled 
that a year ago he recognized a gaunt middle-aged man among the homeless people 
waiting in line for a night's shelter at the Santa Ana Armory. 
</P>
<P>
The man had held a $25,000-a-year job at the Voit rubber plant in Santa Ana 
before the plant closed in 1983, Fogarty said. But in the intervening years, he 
had been unable to find work, lost his house and family and suffered a mental 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the experiences of the unemployed in Orange County reflect 
economic changes affecting the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the longest peacetime economic expansion in the country's history, 
nearly 10 million Americans were victims of plant closings and layoffs from 
1983 to 1988, according to a recent study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Of 4.7 million people who had worked at least 3 years for their former 
employer, 70% had found new employment by January of last year, the study said. 
But only half managed to match their previous incomes, and one in three took 
pay cuts of 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Changes Expected 
</P>
<P>
The trend is expected to continue as corporate America restructures itself to 
become more competitive in the world marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe the average American laborer is in for a lot of pain," said Ray 
Catalano, a professor of social ecology and management at UC Irvine. "I think 
the age of the job with good benefits and some security is pretty much gone." 
</P>
<P>
Some unemployed workers participate in retraining programs in order to update 
their job skills or prepare for a new occupation. 
</P>
<P>
But many can't take advantage of free vocational instruction provided by 
government-subsidized programs because they can't afford to keep paying 
household bills during the months of training. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 months or so of searching, employment officials said, unemployed 
workers usually start feeling pressured by financial obligations. When their 
unemployment benefits are exhausted, they begin accepting jobs that pay 
considerably less than they previously earned. 
</P>
<P>
Those who had put in many years with their previous employers tend to take the 
biggest cuts, employment experts said, because the company-specific knowledge 
they acquired is not valued by new employers. Many must start over at 
entry-level positions. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for casualties of future plant closings in Orange County is not 
rosy, UCLA's Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs are available, he said, so long-term unemployment is not the problem here 
that it is in other areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the county's unemployed eventually find themselves joining an 
economic underclass of low-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Newman, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers local in Santa Ana, said most of the electrical assemblers laid off 
since last April from a Collins Defense Communications facility in Santa Ana 
have found it nearly impossible to find jobs with comparable pay and fringe 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said she has received numerous calls from assemblers who are still 
searching. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they are being too particular," she said. "They want something that 
isn't there. And they aren't willing to settle for less. But they will have 
to." 
</P>

KALINA NICOLOV / 'WITHOUT AN EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, IT IS A DEAD END'

When Xidex Corp. abruptly closed its Irvine computer disk plant Oct. 14, a 
state labor market analyst predicted that its 825 workers would soon find new 
jobs. After all, the analyst said, Orange County had one of the nation's lowest 
unemployment rates, its economy was booming and other manufacturers were 
clamoring for skilled workers. Three months later, job placement and counseling 
agencies report that many former Xidex workers are still searching for 
comparable jobs. Several days after the plant closing, The Times asked former 
Xidex workers Gil Banfill and Kalina Nicolov if they would share their job 
hunting experiences. The Times accompanied them on job interviews, visits to 
the Employment Development Department and job counseling sessions. Here are 
their stories. 
</P>
<P>
In the elevator of a county government building, Kalina Nicolov hugged herself 
for a moment and shivered. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 50, she was considering going back to school. She had no doubt it 
would be the best thing for her to do. But it was scary. 
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks of job hunting had proven frustrating. She had driven from one 
company to another in a large industrial area near her one-bedroom Tustin 
apartment and learned that she was unqualified for any kind of job that would 
pay enough to support her and her son. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolov, one of 825 workers whose jobs were lost when Xidex Corp. abruptly 
closed its Irvine computer disk plant in October, had come face to face with 
the biggest problem experienced by many victims of industrial layoffs in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
To earn a decent living, she was told, she needed to develop new skills through 
one or more government-funded retraining programs. But to pursue retraining, 
she needed to figure out how to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
A refugee from Bulgaria, Nicolov had fought a political battle to come to the 
United States to be with her son and husband and attempt to build a better 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, that dream seemed to be crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, her husband lost his construction job and moved to Las Vegas to 
drive a taxicab. And in October, Nicolov was thrown out of work when Xidex 
Corp. abruptly closed its Irvine computer disk manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like somebody hit me with something," said Nicolov, whose wages had 
increased from $6 an hour to $7.61 during her 4 years as a quality control 
inspector with Xidex. 
</P>
<P>
"In Communist countries, they never lay off people like that," she said. "What 
good is freedom if you can't do anything about it?" 
</P>
<P>
As she hunted for a new job with companies in the industrial greenbelts of 
Irvine, she said, she felt like "the only one in America who isn't rich." 
</P>
<P>
She worried that she was quickly using up her severance pay and that the $142 
in unemployment insurance she received each week wouldn't go far toward 
covering expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolov figured that she needed to take home $1,200 a month to cover her $600 
rent payment, a $260 car payment and other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Her greatest fear was that her son, Tresseam, might fall behind or drop out of 
his classes at Rancho Santiago College. "Without an education in the United 
States, it is a dead end," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Xidex plant closed, he had been working after school and weekends to 
bring in extra money. 
</P>
<P>
And events were forcing Nicolov to think about her own schooling. 
</P>
<P>
An energetic woman who had regularly worked weekends to accumulate overtime at 
Xidex, Nicolov was itching to work again. Her initial plan was to conquer the 
job market by applying at every manufacturing firm that was hiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out and look at the (hiring) signs and stop and go in. I go and go and 
keep going." 
</P>
<P>
But during the second week of her job search, Nicolov pinched a nerve in her 
back and was laid up for 17 days. 
</P>
<P>
When she resumed her job hunt, the realization sunk in that with her job 
skills, she was unlikely to land a job paying better than $6 an hour, or $1,040 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
And she was handicapped by her shaky command of English and her heavy accent, 
although less so than many of her former colleagues. At Xidex, most of her 
co-workers were Cambodians, Vietnamese and Filipinos who spoke less English 
than she. 
</P>
<P>
She could understand what others said to her, but her grammar was hit or miss. 
Because she was insecure about her speaking ability, her words were sometimes 
soft and indistinct. 
</P>
<P>
When she submitted an application at AST Research Inc., a computer manufacturer 
in Irvine, the security guard made her repeat herself several times until she 
understood that Nicolov was looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
To survive in Orange County, Nicolov realized, she would have to become 
something more than a factory quality control inspector. 
</P>
<P>
She thought of studying massage therapy, a suggestion made by the therapist at 
the chiropractor's office where Nicolov sought treatment for her back. But she 
scrapped that plan after she checked into a private program for teaching 
physical therapy and learned that the courses would cost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Then Nicolov heard about Jobs Plus, a government-financed job placement and 
occupational training program that has funds to assist people who lose their 
jobs in plant closures. 
</P>
<P>
She filled out the necessary papers, took English and math tests and was 
processed into the program through a series of interviews with counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs Plus counselor Carmen Whitegon told Nicolov that the job market was 
flooded with quality control workers. She could send Nicolov to interview for a 
job paying no more than $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to do quality control all your life, do you?" Whitegon asked. A 
better strategy, she suggested, would be for Nicolov to take advantage of 
federally financed training to learn clerical skills while she was still 
entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolov was directed to another office and another interview, this time with a 
counselor who specialized in vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
The counselor, Manny Atuatasi, told her that Jobs Plus would finance a 12-week 
clerical course at a cost of about $3,000. At the end of the course, she would 
be helped with job placement. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolov, who is skilled at operating Bulgarian keyboards, was told that she not 
only would learn American typing style but also word processing on a computer 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolov was sent to register at Service Employment and Redevelopment Operation, 
a nonprofit job placement and training organization in Santa Ana. Her classes 
would be conveniently near her son's college. If she had trouble getting to 
classes, she was told, she would be eligible for free bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
On the elevator from the Jobs Plus office to the county parking lot, Nicolov 
began to shake at the thought of returning to school as a middle-aged woman in 
a foreign country. "I am nervous because I don't know if I can do it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Nicolov entered the front office of Service Employment, she grew even more 
nervous. She spotted a flyer that described clerical classes and jobs for 
graduates, ranging in pay from $4.50 to $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
She was stunned, realizing that was much less than her wages at Xidex and no 
better than she would get by staying in factory work. 
</P>
<P>
Leonor Duran, the Service Employment operations director, explained to Nicolov 
that she could earn substantially more money if she learned computer 
programming. But that would take an extra 8 weeks of instruction after about 13 
weeks of basic clerical training. 
</P>
<P>
James Sanchez, Service Employment executive director, said a clerical worker 
trained on a word processor initially can be employed at $8 an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The more computer applications you know, the more marketable you are," he 
said. "Each new application you earn means more dollars in your pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
He said he recently placed a graduate with excellent grammar, typing skills and 
very sharp computer skills in a job paying $21 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
But there was another hitch. Nicolov had tested in English at only a 
sixth-grade reading level. She would have to read at a ninth-grade level before 
she would qualify to study computer programming. Bringing her English up to 
snuff, she was told, probably would take yet another month of schooling and 
would have to be her first priority. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear that if Nicolov wanted a clerical career that would pay her 
bills, she would need to attend classes from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through 
Friday for about 6 months -- not 12 weeks as she was originally advised by the 
Jobs Plus counselor. 
</P>
<P>
The realization hit hard. "I have to be sure I can make my living in these 6 
months," she told Duran. 
</P>
<P>
She would think it over during the long Thanksgiving weekend, she said. In 
parting, Duran advised her that if she could swing it, the clerical training 
would pay off. 
</P>
<P>
That weekend Nicolov did a lot of thinking. She was concerned that even if she 
successfully completed the course, the school might get her a job for only $4 
or $6 an hour. "And I don't know at my age if I will be any good at school," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, she had dropped the idea of learning word processing. 
Instead, she decided to try to launch a baby-sitting business. She got a 
license and distributed flyers advertising her child-care service in laundry 
rooms and on doors in the apartment complex where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
But 6 weeks later she was still trying to get her first customer. She said a 
number of parents had called to inquire about her service and promised to get 
back to her "just like the companies" she has applied to that also somehow 
never call back. 
</P>
<P>
As 1989 rolled in, she was determined to again begin looking for a job in 
earnest, which for her means hitting three, four or more companies a day. She 
was even applying for a job in Los Angeles, although that would require a long 
commute or a move. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is time to find something," she said.

GIL BANFILL /'I'M NOT GOING BACK TO $6 AN HOUR AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT.'

When Xidex Corp. abruptly closed its Irvine computer disk plant Oct. 14, a 
state labor market analyst predicted that its 825 workers would soon find new 
jobs. After all, the analyst said, Orange County had one of the nation's lowest 
unemployment rates, its economy was booming and other manufacturers were 
clamoring for skilled workers. Three months later, job placement and counseling 
agencies report that many former Xidex workers are still searching for 
comparable jobs. Several days after the plant closing, The Times asked former 
Xidex workers Gil Banfill and Kalina Nicolov if they would share their job 
hunting experiences. The Times accompanied them on job interviews, visits to 
the Employment Development Department and job counseling sessions. Here are 
their stories. 
</P>
<P>
For Gil Banfill, it had been a long, slow process winning the promotions that 
raised his wages at Xidex Corp. from $6 an hour to $10.96 and accumulating the 
years of service needed to receive 3 weeks of annual vacation. 
</P>
<P>
After 5 years with Xidex, Banfill often earned as much as $700 a week with 
overtime. His wages were supplemented by the salary of his wife, Polly, a 
licensed vocational nurse. 
</P>
<P>
With their combined income, the couple had hoped to move out of an old mobile 
home park in Santa Ana soon and relocate in a newer park in a safer 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
And with retirement age approaching, Banfill, 53, had been encouraged by 
Xidex's retirement plan. The company kicked in 50 cents for every $1 he 
contributed, up to 6% of his pay. Banfill had accumulated $11,000 in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
But after Xidex shut down its Irvine plant with no warning in October, Banfill 
realized that his plans for a nicer home and a steady investment in a secure 
retirement would have to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, after searching 3 months for a comparable job without success, his 
biggest concern is to hold on to what he has, to avoid a downhill slide into a 
lower standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill has seen it happen before. In 1980, he went to work for Smith 
International, where he earned the best money of his life: $11.37 a hour. 
</P>
<P>
He was laid off by Smith during the economic downturn of 1982, and it took him 
8 months to find another job. He and his wife moved to Seattle, thinking that 
jobs would be easier to come by there. They weren't. Shipping the furniture to 
Seattle and back cost them $2,600. 
</P>
<P>
And when Banfill finally moved back to Orange County and got a job at Xidex, he 
took almost a 50% pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going back to $6 an hour again if I can help it," he said as he 
started his latest job hunt this fall. "I need at least $8 or $9." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his job search, Banfill began to worry that his age and salary 
expectations will scare off potential employers. In jest, he wondered aloud if 
he should dye his silver hair. 
</P>
<P>
As lead inspector in the Xidex chemistry lab, Banfill made sure the computer 
memory disks were properly lubricated so they would last longer. He used 
balances to weigh empty aluminium pans and aluminum pans filled with lubricator 
that had been drained off one of the sampled disks. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill doubts if any other company would hire him to do the same thing, since 
he believes that Xidex was the only maker of computer hard disks in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
After the plant closing, Xidex was flooded with calls from other Orange County 
companies looking for workers. Many of the job openings were for $5-an-hour 
production workers. (Xidex factory workers earned between $6 to $12 an hour.) 
The rest were reserved for typists, engineers, senior accounting clerks, 
computer programmers and purchasing managers, all requiring greater technical 
skill or education than Banfill possesses. 
</P>
<P>
As his accent suggests, Banfill was raised in Worcester, Mass. The fifth of 14 
children, he ended his education after his sophomore year in high school to 
help support his family. He married for the first time at 19. 
</P>
<P>
From his favorite rocker in the living room of his mobile home, Banfill can see 
the memorabilia of his life. There are pictures of the eight children that he 
and his wife share from their former marriages and their 11 grandchildren. 
There are also his and her bowling trophies and antiques inherited from his 
wife's mother.

The Banfills take pride in living within their means. At Christmas, they don't 
buy individual presents for each other. Together, they buy something for the 
house. One year it was a VCR, on which Banfill likes to record the television 
Westerns on which he dotes. Another year it was the double tape deck on which 
his wife records gospel songs. 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas, the Banfills bought nothing for themselves, although they 
purchased some smaller presents for the grandchildren. Polly made fudge for the 
rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill spends more hours in the mobile home now than when he was working. He 
tidies up the place and tends to the roses by the front door and reads the 
Bible and religious books piled on the ottoman to try to take his mind off his 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learn to Take It' 
</P>
<P>
"I just learn to take it," he said, reflecting on his unemployment. "You have 
to be patient. There is a lot in there on patience," he said, pointing to a 
Bible. "Especially in Psalms and Proverbs." 
</P>
<P>
When he was working, Banfill awoke at 4:30 a.m. to be on the job by 5:45 a.m. 
Now he sleeps until 7 a.m., when he dresses in a sports shirt and slacks to 
make the rounds of personnel offices. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill gets most of his job leads from newspaper want ads. He sets out with a 
list of companies and their addresses. In many cases, he knows nothing about 
them other than that they are hiring. He also brings along a road map. 
</P>
<P>
He realizes that he would be better off if he knew someone with the authority 
to hire. He got his job at Xidex in large part because the firm's head of 
personnel had previously worked at Smith Tool and knew him. 
</P>
<P>
At American Zettler in Irvine, the receptionist seemed to be waiting for him. 
"Are you by any chance from Xidex?" she asked. After Banfill filled out an 
application, he was gratified to hear that the personnel director of the 
electronics firm wanted to talk with him. 
</P>
<P>
But the personnel director had hoped that Banfill was someone else, a Xidex 
quality control engineer that he wanted to hire. He said he didn't have a job 
for Banfill and referred him to another company that had a government contract 
to provide on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
After filling out government eligibility forms and an on-the-job training 
application, Banfill waited expectantly by the telephone the next day without 
hearing any word. He would wait weeks more without learning the fate of his 
application. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes Lit Up 
</P>
<P>
At Allergan Inc., an eye-care products firm in Irvine, his eyes lit up as he 
walked through the beautifully appointed building, past the large cafeteria 
with canvas paintings and tall windows, past the employee gymnasium and into 
the personnel office. 
</P>
<P>
He was handed a clipboard with 27 pages of job openings. But most were for 
scientists, engineers and managers. He found only two openings for which he was 
qualified. He filled out an application. For many days, the memory of that 
place would buoy his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
At Ricoh Electronics Inc., prospective employees were directed by arrows 
through a door off the parking lot and through a hallway to a room crowded with 
job applicants seated at long tables and filling out forms. 
</P>
<P>
A production supervisor walking through the room said there was a lot of 
turnover among hourly workers at the company because of the low wages. Later, 
Banfill rejected Ricoh's offer of a late-night inspector's job at $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
After his first 15 job applications, Banfill had spoken to only three personnel 
officers. Most companies let him fill out an application. Others said not to 
bother because they had no openings. One Saturday, at a job fair at McDonnell 
Douglas in Huntington Beach, he waited an hour and a half for an interview. The 
interviewer "didn't look like he was even interested," Banfill said, because 
the company wanted someone with aircraft experience. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere Banfill was told that his timing was bad. Many companies would not 
be hiring until after the election; then after Thanksgiving; then after the 
first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Thanksgiving, his wife was told that she had to take some of her 
accumulated vacation time. So the two drove to visit her sister in Sacramento 
for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned home, Banfill went directly to his answering machine. Maybe 
one of the companies wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
There was a message from a daughter in Massachusetts and a plea for old clothes 
from the Childrens Hospital of Orange County. There were no job offers. 
</P>
<P>
He then checked the mailbox. There was a letter from Allergan saying the 
company had no job for him but would keep his application on file. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a letter from the state Employment Development Department asking 
him to come in for a routine interview about his employment prospects. Banfill 
was hopeful that he might get some knowledgeable help. 
</P>
<P>
But his hopes were dashed again when he arrived at the department's office. "I 
thought that surely they would find me something," he said, "but they had 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the listings on the bulletin board. There were jobs for typists 
and waitresses. He put his hand up in the air as if balancing a tray, and 
laughed as he pictured himself in a waitress job. 
</P>
<P>
An agency official tried to help. She plowed fruitlessly through a thick book 
of job openings but couldn't even find Banfill's job category listed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Job Leads 
</P>
<P>
Later that week, Banfill was contacted by the Employment Development Department 
and told about a new program the agency was starting for former Xidex workers 
who live in Santa Ana to help them find jobs or free occupational training. He 
scheduled another interview at the agency the following week. Once again he 
went to the department office in Santa Ana and once again he was told the 
department had no job leads for him. 
</P>
<P>
Banfill also heard from the managers of his mobile home park that in January 
his rent would increase to $285 a month from $220. 
</P>
<P>
As the new year approached, Banfill grew hopeful that companies that had been 
distracted by the holidays would get down to the business of hiring new 
personnel. But that expectation also was blasted by reality. The dawn of 1989 
brought newspaper listings of many jobs for which Banfill was qualified but at 
a salary far below what he could afford to take. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, Banfill still was unemployed. So was his his former 
supervisor, who called to ask how he was doing.
