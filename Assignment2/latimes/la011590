A search was launched Sunday several miles west of Mt. Whitney in Inyo County 
for a single-engine plane that disappeared during a flight from Redlands to the 
Stockton area, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The search, led by volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol, began after 
daybreak when the pilot failed to arrive as scheduled at Columbia Airport east 
of Stockton on Saturday afternoon, said Lt. Col. Frank Burnham, a patrol 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old pilot from San Bernardino, whose identity was not released, 
received a weather briefing but failed to file a flight plan when he took off 
from Redlands in San Bernardino County about noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At various times Saturday, the small plane was picked up on radar by air 
controllers at Edwards Air Force Base, Oakland, Palmdale and Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"He was alone, except he had his dog with him," Burnham said. "The pilot has 
about seven years (of flying) experience." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said the four-seat Cessna Hawkeye was equipped with emergency signal 
beacons. A weak signal that may have come from a downed aircraft was briefly 
picked up by two Civil Air Patrol planes from Bishop flying over the search 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an area with 13,000- to 14,000-foot peaks," Burnham said. "The plane was 
seen on radar, but it disappeared below radar level." 
</P>
<P>
Two Air Force F-16s were dispatched from Fresno to fly over the area at 23,000 
and 16,400 feet. The lower flying jet reported a solid cloud cover, severe 
turbulence and icing in the search area, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service dispatched ground crews to the area late Sunday, but a 
ground search was not expected to begin until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Civil Air Patrol helicopters were to join the search early Monday, Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect the weather will be better (Monday)," he said. "One problem is that 
there will be two to three feet of new snow covering the area."

Pope John Paul II on Sunday said he has the flu, but the wave of influenza that 
began sweeping Italy in December has not affected his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
During his ritual Sunday afternoon visit to a Rome parish in his role as bishop 
of Rome, the Pope joked about his apparently mild illness when he met a group 
of converting Catholics and their children, the Italian news agency ANSA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps you're surprised by the fact that the Pope, even though he's a step 
away from the children, doesn't hug and kiss them," John Paul said, according 
to ANSA."He was about to do so, but then he thought that he has a virus, and 
since there's enough influenza going around, there isn't reason to add more."

A VICTORIAN HOMECOMING IN CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One's abiding passions in life do bring moments of curious disadvantage, which 
is a suitably empurpled Victorian way of expressing just what Patricia Watkins 
feels sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
Like when she peers from the widow's watch of her lavishly recreated 
19th-Century home on the coast of Carlsbad and observes how passers-by act when 
they come upon the home, with its tall cupola, witch's hat and a virtual 
dessert tray of gingerbread ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Watkins recalled, "these people pulled up and took a tablecloth out. They 
had champagne, a bucket, a flower vase and a little ghetto blaster. They 
danced, they kissed. They set up a tripod and a camera and took pictures of 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Life can be like that when your home is dubbed "Disneyland South" by the 
neighbors and its Victorian ostentation rises like a frosting apparition in a 
seaside community that didn't even become a city until the Eisenhower 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Gawkers, shutter-snappers and occasional folks who simply knock on the door for 
a well-meaning inquiry are the price Watkins, her husband, William, and their 
six children are willing to pay for owning one of the most unusual and 
prominent residences on the North County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn Pinney of the Carlsbad Convention and Visitors Bureau said, "It's pretty 
outstanding. If you drive up the coast, you don't find many homes like it. In 
fact, I can't think of any." 
</P>
<P>
But only three years after the couple finished building their dream house, 
business demands are requiring them to spend more time in Las Vegas, where 
they're from. So they put their Carlsbad Victorian on the market four months 
ago. The asking price is $3 million, but, hey, that includes the antique 
furniture. The price is $2.5 million if sold nude. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 150 parties have expressed interest in the 3-story, 14-room blue-gray 
residence with burgundy and plum trim that was hand-milled from redwood. 
However, most potential buyers want to convert it into a bed and breakfast for 
tourists, and they disappear upon learning the city won't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is taking the sorrow out of selling their house by planning to erect 
an almost exact duplicate in Las Vegas, where 19th-Century architecture is 
about as natural to the desert as showgirls in rhinestone G-strings. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Watkins family, their long-held affinity for a style popular during 
the long reign of England's Queen Victoria -- a style most later generations 
regarded as silly and dandified -- goes wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>
William Watkins is a well-known Carlsbad area developer and Patricia is a 
former art teacher who specialized in portraits. They married 10 years ago, 
creating a perfect union for collect-aholics who decided to design and furnish 
a Victorian retirement home with a sea view. First, she recounted, the couple 
set about searching for the house that would be right for them -- to copy. 
</P>
<P>
"We took an extensive tour of Victorian homes in Northern California," that 
included Ferndale, Eureka and Arcata up in redwood country. They also 
scrutinized San Francisco's "painted ladies" but decided the architecture "was 
more pure in Ferndale because it's more rural" and thus hadn't been modified 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
They chose a scheme with familiar Victorian features and began two years of 
building in 1984. Neighbors in Terramar, a 1950s-era residential enclave just 
south of the Encinas power plant, watched the construction with considerable 
amusement. 
</P>
<P>
"People were calling it 'Disneyland South,' " recalled Bailey Noble, president 
of the local homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
People were friendly enough, but there was some suspicious talk that drifted 
back to Patricia Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming in from Las Vegas and putting all these phone lines in because we have 
children, somebody asked if we were bookies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the house was done, raised to its full 35-foot height, perhaps the most 
impressed observer was the city's building inspection department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all 2-by-4 lumber studding. It's way overbuilt, you wouldn't believe it," 
said Tony Mata, chief building inspector. "I had to take my whole department 
down there to see it. They were amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody shared that enthusiasm, like the man who laboriously delivered 24 
brass and bronze ceiling fans. "He said, 'Why the hell didn't you put in air 
conditioning?' " Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Although somewhat crowded on a 69-by-105-foot lot, not unlike an original 
Victorian fit, the inside of the Watkins abode has a feeling of spaciousness 
and warmth. Actual 19th-Century homes had cold, tiny rooms with high ceilings, 
but the building code and a desire for comfort caused the family to elect 
bigger rooms, each crowded with antique furniture, lamps, stained-glass 
windows, art and curios. 
</P>
<P>
"We collected Belter furniture. He was the premiere furniture-maker before the 
Civil War," Watkins said. But amid all the antiquity -- the 1870 parlor stove 
and the Tiffany window and much more -- are splashes of pure whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
In one downstairs bathroom, the toilet has the old-fashioned pull-chain from 
the tank located on the wall about six feet above the bowl. The bowl sits 
beneath a sturdy oak chair with a high back and arms decorated with red velvet 
pads. It resembles a formal dining room chair. The seat is flipped to the side 
to make way for relief. 
</P>
<P>
In the second-story office sit two late 1800s barber chairs at the windows 
overlooking the ocean. William and Patricia sit there and gaze. But her chair 
also has a more practical use. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit here and blow my hair dry and watch the people go by," sometimes ducking 
from photographers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, they rather enjoy the attention and the typical 
uncertainty of viewers about whether the home is a genuine Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually had a person ask me whether we dragged this house down from San 
Francisco," she said. "Right down I-5. Right." 
</P>
<P>
People with modern taste usually regard Victoriana as gaudy and foppish. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all of those things," said Watkins. But "you look at something like a 
piece of furniture and you think, look what's happened over the last 100 years, 
and this is still here. . . . It's just so good to feel there was something 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
What Watkins and her husband, owner of Watkins Development Co., hope for 
tomorrow is that a buyer will come along so they can focus entirely on building 
their next new Victorian in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the inquiries on the Carlsbad house, the city's restrictions on bed 
and breakfasts have turned most of the interested parties off. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Michael Holzmiller said five years ago, the city acted 
to safeguard areas with single-family dwellings, and as a result has only one B 
and B. "The city wanted to be cautious and conservative. One issue of concern 
to Carlsbad residents is protection of the R-1 zone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "maybe we're being a little too cautious and we should consider 
(bed and breakfasts) in unique single-family zones." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Watkins is sure her house will sell and her family will go on to the 
next Victorian adventure. But as much as she loves that era, even she has 
limits: "I enjoy the beauty. The next thing I enjoy is the microwave and 
running water and how lucky I am that I wasn't living back then."

The coastal wetlands of Southern California are rapidly disappearing. At the 
turn of the century, there were about 53,000 acres of coastal wetlands between 
Morro Bay and Ensenada, Mexico, according to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. Only 
about 11,000 acres remain. These tidal wetlands are explored in a new exhibit, 
"Mud Flats: Cradle of Life," at the Cabrillo Museum in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 species of marine fish rely on this habitat for spawning and 
nursery areas. In addition, the wetlands serve as important feeding and 
wintering grounds for migratory and resident birds, including some endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Using changing displays and aquariums, the recently opened exhibit reveals the 
importance of these areas and the wide variety of life that can be found there.

ENGINEER HELPS CHART MYSTERIES OF SEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission College instructor Leon A. Risemberg leads a double life. 
</P>
<P>
In his classroom, Risemberg teaches engineering students to work with metal, 
wood and stone. From his Van Nuys home, he guides others through obscure 
corridors in the flesh and blood maze of human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine-born Risemberg, 58, single-handedly operates a free, 24-hour 
telephone help line that lends a sympathetic ear to people with unusual sexual 
preferences. Risemberg has operated his "Bi-Line" service for nine years, 
fielding up to 40 calls a week from transsexuals, bisexuals and transvestites. 
Callers can leave a message on his answering machine if he's not there to take 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern is to help people who are the brunt of prejudice," Risemberg 
said. "Those who are guilty without having to be." 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg the professor is helping create a state-of-the-art engineering 
program at Mission College. Using a $200,000 grant, he has equipped the 
community college's engineering lab with high-tech equipment so students can 
learn the latest methods of computer-aided drafting and design. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, 110 students were enrolled in engineering classes at the college, up 
from 12 two years ago. "We hope to eventually have 300 students," said 
Risemberg, who also does consulting work as a structural engineer. 
</P>
<P>
But engineering alone has not been enough to hold Risemberg's attention. 
Risemberg said he yearned to expand his interests when, during the 1960s, he 
noticed that at parties he ended up talking only to other engineers. So for the 
next 20 years, Risemberg took classes in psychology and human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"I became very interested in those subjects because it was almost the exact 
opposite of what I was doing," Risemberg said. "Math, science, engineering has 
almost nothing to do with people." 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg said he was surprised when he failed a test in his first class in 
human sexuality. "I was 30, 35, had a wife and two kids," he said. "I thought 
people were either gay or straight and that there was nothing in between. I 
finally picked this area of study because it is where there is the least help." 
</P>
<P>
That interest led to the creation of the hot line and to the formation of 
monthly social groups at his home, which Risemberg once called the Bi-Social 
Center but now calls the Pan-Social Center. "I wanted it open to all types of 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Saturday each month, 15 to 60 people meet at Risemberg's home to 
hear his seminar on human sexuality and then make new friends. 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg's two children, who live at home, say most of the visitors are men 
dressed as women. Risemberg is divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"They wear lots of makeup and lots of perfume," said Erin Risemberg, 16. "Dad 
tells them that they're OK, and then they eat and socialize." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday night, six people attended Risemberg's seminar. They 
included a bisexual woman, a woman who has lived eight years as a man, two 
transvestites and a man who had hidden his homosexuality from his wife and 
children for more than 40 years. The sixth person, a man, declined to say 
anything other than give his name when members of the group introduced 
themselves to one another. 
</P>
<P>
One of the transvestites said his wife recently left him after he told her that 
he liked dressing in women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg's experience as a classroom teacher was apparent during his hourlong 
talk on human sexuality. He used a chalkboard set up in his living room, passed 
out an outline and encouraged questions. His message was simple: Your sexual 
preference is not your fault; it was decided largely before you could talk. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of his seminar another 15 to 20 people -- mostly men elaborately 
dressed in women's clothing -- start arriving. They gather in the kitchen to 
talk and drink coffee, drifting in and out of the living room to sample some of 
the food Risemberg has made available. 
</P>
<P>
Later, they will sit in groups and talk about what's on their mind. 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg is careful to point out that he offers only peer counseling, not 
therapy. Many times parents come to learn how to deal with gay and lesbian 
children, and wives come to learn about husbands who dress as women, Risemberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Using the smooth, measured voice that he employs with callers to the Bi-Line, 
Risemberg explains some of the many variations on human sexuality, which he 
said are only partly determined by a person's physical anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Risemberg explained the man who is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
"An anatomical male with a female gender identity who is attracted to women may 
look like a straight man," Risemberg said. "But he is really a woman in a man's 
body who is attracted to other women." 
</P>
<P>
The woman trapped in a man's body, or vice versa, is described by Risemberg as 
a transsexual. Both transvestites and transsexuals can be either gay or 
straight or bisexual, he said. They can have operations to change their 
physical organs to match their internal leanings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More rare is what Risemberg calls intersex, people having both male and female 
sex organs. "In general, they are mostly bisexual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, bisexuals and transsexuals are depressed over feeling so 
different from the rest of society. In particular, teen-agers who are ashamed 
about their sexuality often think suicide is their only answer, Risemberg said. 
"They are people who feel threatened for who they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Risemberg said his monthly gatherings are especially helpful to parents of gay 
or transsexual teen-agers. "Sometimes after one of our meetings, it's the first 
time a child speaks truthfully with his parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people are suffering as a result of ignorance," Risemberg said.

GOSPEL CHOIR SINGS TO SAVE YOUNG LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: A PACOIMA GOSPEL GROUP SEEKS TO KEEP YOUTHS OFF THE STREETS. ONE WAS SO

<P>
When the Pacoima Community Gospel Choir came to sing at the Ventura School in 
October, 1988, the music struck a chord in 20-year-old DeWitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, serving a 2 1/2-year cocaine-possession sentence at the school, a 
California Youth Authority facility in Camarillo, said he started by tapping 
his foot. A little later he was snapping his fingers. Then clapping. Finally, 
he was joining in and singing along with the choir. By the end of the 35-minute 
performance, Smith said, he was "moving almost the whole bench" as his 
250-pound frame swayed to the music. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just overjoyed," he said. "You don't usually feel like that when you're 
incarcerated." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that Sunday afternoon, Smith said: "I was like, 'One day I want to do 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Smith, who was released from custody Oct. 4, did just that -- 
he went to his first practice with the choir. He said he now looks forward to 
the day when he can return to the Ventura School -- this time as a member of 
the choir -- and make someone else feel the way he did that afternoon, return 
the favor, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's story is what the Pacoima Community Gospel Choir is all about. For the 
past 13 years, the 25-member group has used gospel music to relay a message of 
hope to young people who often have none. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1977, the choir began as a way to keep young people off the streets. 
Out of the choir grew a host of services for young people that were 
incorporated in 1980 as the Pacoima Community Youth Cultural Center. The center 
offers tutoring, martial arts classes, health education and a drama group. 
</P>
<P>
The choir has remained the organization's centerpiece, but over the years its 
makeup and purpose have changed slightly. The choir's members, who are in their 
20s and 30s, are older than those in the original group. And most of the 
choir's performances each year are at juvenile detention centers, like the 
Ventura School. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to bring them up," said choir member Betty Doss, referring to the 
youths. "We want to show them that there is hope." 
</P>
<P>
"We're reaching out to try to make a difference," said Jane McGlory, 56, 
founder of the choir. 
</P>
<P>
The choir, and much of what followed, is the product of one woman's dream. 
Literally. Since 1977, McGlory has acted as a sort of mother hen, making sure 
that the organization she envisioned in a dream stays true to its original 
purpose: keeping the young people of the northeastern San Fernando Valley away 
from crime and drugs by giving them something else to do. 
</P>
<P>
But the seed for the choir was planted in bitter soil. 
</P>
<P>
McGlory's oldest son, Bill, died on Thanksgiving, 1974, from a heroin overdose. 
He had been home just over 30 days after a three-year stint in the Army, 
including a tour of duty in Vietnam. McGlory said her son went into the army a 
non-cigarette smoker and came out addicted to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
"I buried him at 21 and it's not a good feeling," McGlory said. "That's been 
the hardest pill I've had to swallow in this life so far." 
</P>
<P>
But out of her son's death, McGlory said she found a mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dedicated my life to helping young people not go to an early grave and to 
helping them find a better life," she said. "I want to help another parent not 
have to feel the hurt I was feeling." 
</P>
<P>
During the next few years, McGlory met with the young people in her community 
on a one-on-one basis, telling her story and warning them of the dangers of the 
fast life. But repeated visits to Rucker's Mortuary for the funerals of young 
people showed McGlory that her message wasn't reaching enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
So she prayed for guidance. The answer, she said, came in a dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asleep one night and I dreamed about this beautiful choir," McGlory 
said. "I sat straight up in bed and said, 'That's the answer.' . . . Young 
people like music and gospel music has a message." 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people showed up for the choir's first rehearsal in June, 1977, in the 
youth room of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Pacoima. That first meeting 
was informal; there was no printed music. But McGlory laid down the rules of 
the choir, rules that still apply today. No smoking. No drinking. And, to be 
sure, no drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Within three months, word of the choir spread and membership grew to a high of 
75. A month after the choir was established, a drama group was formed. From 
there, McGlory said, things began to blossom and the center was incorporated in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
McGlory used the money from her son's insurance to buy the green three-bedroom 
house next to her own. That became the center's first home. After the center 
moved to a city-owned building on Glenoaks Boulevard in 1982, McGlory turned 
the house into a halfway house for young men just released from custody. That's 
where Smith lives now. 
</P>
<P>
Gospel music might seem incongruous with reaching young toughs in a juvenile 
facility, but those involved with the choir say that's not necessarily so. Much 
of today's popular music has its roots in gospel. And for many of those in the 
facility, the music has a double meaning. Gospel grew out of "the pain and 
suffering of the slaves," said Howard Green, the center's first vice president. 
But the music is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
And for sheer energy, nothing beats gospel. When the group gets rolling, it 
brings the music -- and the audience -- to life. At a recent rehearsal the 
choir swayed and clapped through a set of about five songs. 
</P>
<P>
"For that individual who has been exposed to gospel music, it gives him 
comfort," Green said. "Everything is gone, but he can fall back on something he 
knew as he was growing up." 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to say that your life can change and you don't have to go back" 
to jail, said John Nixon, the youth center's chaplain.

YOUTH HELD IN SLAYING OF BROTHER; 
</P>
<P>
FOUND: BRADLEY MINKOFF VANISHED THE DAY THE BODY OF HIS BROTHER WAS DISCOVERED. 
INITIALLY CONSIDERED A POSSIBLE VICTIM, HE BECAME A SUSPECT.

An Agoura Hills teen-ager who disappeared after his older brother was shot to 
death New Year's Eve in the family's home has been arrested and charged with 
the murder, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Minkoff, 18, was arrested at a friend's apartment in North Hollywood 
late Saturday, three days after Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies obtained 
a warrant charging him with killing his brother, Michael Minkoff, 20, said 
Deputy Rafael Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager will be arraigned Tuesday in Malibu Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Minkoff, an engineering student at Moorpark College, was shot several 
times and found dead about 11:30 a.m. Dec. 31 in the family's home in the 28900 
block of Dargan Street. Deputies responded to a 911 call apparently made by the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the young men's parents, Barbara and David Minkoff, were on 
vacation in Mexico. Deputies said the two brothers had been seen together at 
the home the day before the shooting, but they said Bradley Minkoff was missing 
at the time his brother's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, sheriff's homicide investigators said they only wanted to question 
the younger brother and did not rule out the possibility that he also was a 
crime victim. The investigators found no sign of forced entry at the home. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, sheriff's Sgt. Bill Gaynor said, "There's always 
been sibling rivalry" between the brothers. He added, "I don't know there was 
enough to kill." 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, deputies named Bradley Minkoff in an arrest warrant issued 
from Malibu Municipal Court. Sheriff's investigators told Los Angeles police 
they believed Minkoff was staying with friends in the 5300 block of Vantage 
Avenue, Los Angeles police Sgt. Phil Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Using an unmarked car, undercover officers watched the apartment and arrested 
Minkoff when he returned about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, Butler said. He was turned 
over to deputies at the West Hollywood sheriff's station, where he was held on 
suspicion of murder. He was later transferred to the Los Angeles County Central 
Jail, where he was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, deputies said no other arrests were made at the North Hollywood 
apartment. They refused to discuss any motive in the shooting or explain why 
Minkoff was identified as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The violent incident stunned families living on the Minkoffs' short, neatly 
landscaped Agoura Hills street, where neighbors gather for a festive block 
party each Fourth of July and where criminal activity rarely occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very eerie to come down the block and see their house now," one neighbor 
said Sunday. "Here we are in our safe little cul-de-sac. There hasn't even been 
a burglary here in 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said the shooting did not prompt 
residents to worry about their own security. "We knew it was just a family 
tragedy," the resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors rallied behind the family and declined to discuss the event 
publicly. Others said the Minkoffs kept mainly to themselves. They said they 
knew the brothers only from the cars each drove down the block -- Michael in a 
brown Audi and Bradley in a black Corvette. The older brother's auto was still 
parked outside the family's home on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for the parents," said one woman who lives on the block. "They lost 
two sons: one who's dead and one who's been locked up. I wish in my heart that 
he's not the one."

KING'S BIRTHDAY LEAVES PARENTS SCRAMBLING FOR LAST-MINUTE CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Luther King Jr. may have been one of the most influential Americans, but 
the holiday honoring him is still trying to catch on, especially among working 
parents with kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
When some parents take their children to school today, they will discover that 
the schools are closed -- and so are the child-care centers they rely on. 
</P>
<P>
Some working parents will "scramble like crazy" when they take their children 
to school and find locked doors, said Bobbie Dupre, owner and director of an 
Encinitas child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Dupre's center, Care for Me Today, is licensed for 23 children, but she usually 
keeps about seven spaces open daily for "drop-ins," as she calls them. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents tend not to read signs," she said. "Schools send home the schedules, 
but parents read them at the beginning of the year and don't look at them 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"They get the child ready for school, pack up the lunch, then they get to the 
school only to find that it's closed. They are supposed to call ahead, but they 
usually just rush right over here. . . . If I have the room for them, I take 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But at least four parents have read the schedules. As of Friday, four of 
Dupre's open slots had been reserved for today. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents, including Sandra Alcoser, 44, will leave their children with a 
relative. Alcoser has to be at her factory job at 7:30 a.m., so Gustavo, 6, 
will spend the day with either his grandmother or an older sister. 
</P>
<P>
The boy attends Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Logan Heights. His 
mother usually drops him off at the children's center, a few steps away from 
the school, at 7 a.m. and picks him up about 10 hours later. "When he's in 
school, I'm able to bring him here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The King center is one of 27 city centers that provide child care for about 
2,100 children, said Pascual Martinez, child development director for San Diego 
Unified School District. About 850 youngsters attend kindergarten preparation 
classes at 22 sites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said parents have not complained about the centers being closed on the 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"They would complain if we did something unexpectedly," he said. "But we give 
them a schedule at the beginning of the year." 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of programs providing child care for other city schools finds: 
</P>
<P>
* Social Advocacy for Youth, which provides care at 12 schools for about 360 
children, will be closed today. There have not been enough requests that the 
centers remain open for the holiday, said Susan Arentson, unit supervisor of 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, some parents express concern," she said. "I can venture to guess 
that most parents take the day off or make other arrangements with a relative 
or a neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
* The Peninsula YMCA provides an after-school program for about 155 children at 
four schools in Pacific Beach and Point Loma, said Doug Jones, program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
On holidays, the Y plans "holiday fun days," Jones said. Today, they will take 
about 35 children roller-skating in Chula Vista, and perhaps, to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents are happy that we provide an option" when schools are closed, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
* Classic Kids' three Mira Mesa school sites will be open, serving about 198 
children, said Nancy Ajemian, executive director of Harmonium Inc., the 
nonprofit group that runs the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to work through the difficulties of staying open on holidays," 
Ajemian said. "A lot of parents are not accustomed to the holiday. It's awfully 
hard on parents that have to work." 
</P>
<P>
In Solana Beach, the district's three elementary schools and its Child 
Development Center, which serves about 200 children, will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Parents bringing their children to the center last week declined to give their 
names. But one father said that he would care for his baby on the holiday. A 
mother said she had planned ahead: "My husband is taking care of them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children who attend the five elementary schools in the Carlsbad 
Unified School District participate in "Scampers," a recreational program run 
by the Boys and Girls Club that serves about 400 preschoolers through 
sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The schools out of which the program is run will be closed, but the clubhouse 
in Carlsbad Village will be open, said Dawn Fenner, program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Special holiday activities are planned: A singer will perform at the clubhouse, 
and there will be a trip to Chuck E Cheese's for pizza and a movie. 
</P>
<P>
The child-care programs run by Child Development Associates in National City, 
Chula Vista and El Cajon will be open today, said Charlene Tressler, executive 
director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tressler said the centers serve 228 school-age children in those cities and 245 
preschoolers in Chula Vista and El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we overlook the holiday," Tressler said. "It's that so many of 
the businesses do not give the day off. . . . We try to serve the working 
parent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But just finding someone to take care of the children is no guarantee of peace 
of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Francine Gallegos, 32, is a single mother who works as a word processor in the 
San Diego mayor's office. She is not working today, and she is glad because the 
last time she had to get a baby-sitter for her 4-year-old son, Patrick, "It was 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
"She (the baby-sitter) didn't speak English, and Patrick doesn't speak Spanish. 
. . . He was very mischievous. He ruined the Christmas tree, broke the phone, 
broke the stereo needle and ate more than he should have." 
</P>
<P>
Other parents, however, are fortunate enough to have the ultimate solution. 
They have the day off.

CHURCH GROUP TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of more than 40 churches in the northeast San Fernando Valley 
announced plans Sunday to form a community-based volunteer group to combat 
social problems such as drugs and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a meeting of the Ministers' Fellowship of the 
Greater San Fernando Valley attended by more than 200 people, including 
representatives from several homeowner groups, at First United Methodist Church 
of Pacoima. Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden delivered a brief speech 
supporting the group's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Taylor, assistant to the president of the group, said the organization 
wants to reassert the black church's historical importance and effectiveness in 
dealing with a number of social ills, including the proliferation of drugs, 
gang activity and other crime in northeast Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the organization, known as the Ministers' Fellowship of the Greater 
San Fernando Valley, will establish a non-religious group, to be named Focus 
90, to address these issues. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group will provide counseling, drug- and alcohol-treatment programs 
and financial support to homeless youngsters or those who might be without 
proper family support. The group also will be involved in neighborhood cleanup 
programs in an effort to restore community pride, and will work closely with 
the Los Angeles Police Deparment to provide safer neighborhoods, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group's main goal will be to re-establish the church's leadership 
role in the community, something he said was lost with the assassination of 
Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. King's birthday is being celebrated today as a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try and create that type of leadership again, in a small way, in 
the northeast Valley," Taylor said, adding that he hoped that social programs 
established by the fellowship would spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony Sunday, the Rev. James V. Lyles, pastor of the First United 
Methodist Church of Pacoima, was installed as president of the fellowship. 
Lyles was elected to the post two months ago.

BIG-RIG DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER 60-MILE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The driver of a tractor-trailer truck was arrested Sunday on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon after leading officers on a 60-mile chase that 
involved several minor accidents and the truck's crash on the Ventura Freeway 
in Camarillo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, whose identity was withheld, was arrested after slamming into a 
light pole on the westbound freeway near Camarillo Springs Road, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if the driver of the truck was injured in the 
crash, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 7:40 p.m. when the Western Mayflower moving van hit a 
parked car in Glendora, Bruce said. When the truck failed to stop, the car's 
driver followed the truck onto the westbound Foothill Freeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the California Highway Patrol became involved in the pursuit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase continued to the westbound Ventura Freeway at speeds to 70 m.p.h., 
Bruce said. Several vehicles were reported hit by the truck, but no details 
were available about damage or injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the driver of the truck lost control of the vehicle and 
smashed into the light pole about 8:30 p.m., Bruce said. The driver was 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and various other 
charges, Bruce said.

SOCIETY SECURITY EARNINGS CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial advocating the elimination of the Social Security "earnings cap" 
was right on the mark ("Time to Eliminate the Inequity," Jan. 7). It is high 
time that our nation recognizes the value of our seniors and stops this 
counterproductive practice. 
</P>
<P>
I have introduced a bill in Congress (HR 311) that will do just as your 
editorial recommended -- remove the earnings limitation altogether. The 
earnings test places an unfair penalty on the elderly. I hold by the philosophy 
that "a dollar earned is a dollar earned" and I can see no justification for 
requiring a forfeiture of $1 in Social Security benefits for every $2 or $3 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, I believe we should allow senior citizens to maintain full and 
productive lives and to earn their full value for any work. These are the 
people who possess knowledge and experience that are invaluable to our economy.

Much said in Ernest Conine's column "The Other 'Sick' Power Needs Help, Too" 
(Dec. 25, Op-Ed Page,) is true. We do have our own problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
But what is the justification that the world must be divided into classes and

of the Business World 1000 should be American? Where is the fairness that our 
5% of the world population consumes 40% of the world's energy output? What 
happened to our preaching in market economy, equity, freedom of trade and 
democracy?

'CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times is to be commended for focusing editorial attention on the problem of 
long-term care for America's elderly. 
</P>
<P>
If we are to treat the problem intelligently, however, we must begin to draw a 
distinction between health care -- curing the sick and injured -- and long-term 
care, which is primarily providing help in day-to-day living for those elderly 
persons who need it, whether at home or in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is more than a mere question of semantics. The United States is 
almost alone among nations in lumping into its health care expenditures the 
"housekeeping" functions of aiding the elderly, such as room and board, being 
fed, bathed and dressed. It would be a more accurate representation of actual 
services rendered to regard such expenditures as part of social services, 
rather than health care. Allocating funds from health service budgets to 
provide non-health care translates into fewer dollars to treat acute health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the elderly among us do require more health care than the general 
population. But providing the means to treat the ill and injured and providing 
nursing home care for the elderly are nonetheless two different challenges.

'CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial "Changes in Health Care" (Jan. 2) revives the hope that, 
somehow, two new presidential commissions reviewing our country's health 
problems may discover a new "magic bullet" solution. 
</P>
<P>
Government and private studies have addressed these problems over at least the 
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary efforts to constrain runaway hospital charges have failed. Efforts to 
transfer increasing costs to patients have resulted in more than a million new 
people denied access to medical care each year. Charges for doctors' services 
continue to escalate. The results are that American consumers pay more per 
capita for health services than any nation in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a "magic bullet" we need to recognize (a) partial patchwork 
reforms don't work; (b) comprehensive changes in how health care services are 
delivered and financed are essential; (c) national and state budget controls 
with increased public financing are a must, and (d) universal access to care is 
essential.

IMMIGRANT KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleasantly surprised to note The Times had recognized the efforts of the 
Alhambra School District in its editorial "Bridges for Immigrant Children" 
(Dec. 27). Overcrowding is but one part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting the needs of a multicultural enrollment and making public education 
work for immigrant children is a constant challenge. Children, as well as 
parents, need support in order to make a successful transition into American 
society. 
</P>
<P>
I consider the Alhambra School District fortunate for having had the vision to 
prepare for our immigrant newcomers. Much of our success comes from our 
dedicated bilingual teachers and English-as-a-second language specialists who 
use their knowledge and talent toward turning their students into productive, 
English-proficient participants while nurturing a respect and appreciation for 
the many different cultures present in our schools. It is never easy, but 
nobody ever said it would be. In Alhambra, we see the positive results from 
meeting the challenge head-on.

I am a hemodialysis patient who depends on dialysis three times a week to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare has informed us who dialyze at home that Congress has cut costs by 50% 
on Method II dialysis which will affect many dialysis patients like myself. 
This will mean going back to a unit where the care is not as good as what you 
receive at home. What upsets me is reading in the paper where President Bush 
has approved salary increases of up to 35% for top government workers and yet 
has done nothing to solve this Medicare crisis. All I can say is where is the 
justice by doing this?

CHINA: TO ENCOURAGE THE FORCES OF DEMOCRACY, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUST KEEP 
PUSHING BEIJING WHILE IGNORING CALLS FOR A RETURN TO A POLICY OF ISOLATION AND 
BLOCKADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MING RUAN and WEI GUO, Ming Ruan and Wei Guo (a pseudonym) are Chinese 
scholars in the United States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Richard Nixon's historic opening of the 1970s, a major change has 
occurred in Chinese politics. Forces demanding economic and political reform 
have arisen. Although they have suffered a temporary setback, these forces 
ultimately will prevail. The United States must fashion a China policy that 
acknowledges this reality. 
</P>
<P>
Although a consensus in the United States favors these political and economic 
reforms, the current debate on China policy has become mired in criticism of 
the Bush Administration's dispatch of two senior officials to meet with the 
leadership in Beijing. This is misdirected. The debate should concentrate on 
this issue: How can the United States best assist the process of reform? 
</P>
<P>
We call for an active China policy that seeks to retain contact with the 
leaders and people of China, and offers strong moral support and fosters 
contact with the democratic forces on the mainland and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush made a mistake when, on June 20, he suspended high-level 
official contacts as a sanction against Beijing's suppression of the student 
movement. Rather than punishing the Chinese government, that policy constrained 
the American government. It limited the President's diplomatic flexibility. 
Conservative forces in China would like to see China's door shut and they have 
taken measures to cut off the communication with the outside world. Bush's 
suspension of high-level contacts served these people's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Administration finds itself in an embarrassing position, having broken 
its own promise while misleading Congress and the American people. Bush should 
have the courage to admit publicly that his June 20 decision was a mistake and 
that to correct it, he had to violate his own guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has made other mistakes. The deference that National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcraft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger demonstrated toward China's leaders -- emphasizing personal warmth 
and clinking glasses at a banquet -- was inappropriate. And their failure to 
allude to the Chinese government's suppression of the democracy movement and to 
refer to the world's revulsion of its deeds -- as Nixon did during his October 
trip -- is regrettable. Further, the secrecy was unnecessary, risking the 
bipartisanship so essential to the successful conduct of American policy on 
China. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental issue, however, still is whether Washington should politically 
isolate and economically blockade China. Here we part with the Administration's 
critics. In the 1950s, the United States pursued a similar policy, hoping to 
push China onto the path of freedom. Instead, it drove Beijing into the Soviet 
embrace and contributed to its evolution into a Stalinist totalitarian system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1944-45, Mao Tse-tung wanted to follow a very different domestic course. Mao 
believed that cooperation with the United States would not only help him defeat 
the Japanese invaders, but also allow him to compete with the despotic Chiang 
Kai-shek while resisting Josef Stalin's pressures. But the American response 
gave Mao little choice but to lean toward the Soviets once Washington let it be 
known that it saw Chinese communism as a threat to its interests. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon ended this fruitless policy by opening Sino-American relations in the 
1970s. The Carter Administration's decision to establish full diplomatic 
relations in 1979, and the economic reform program China initiated the same 
year, led to the rapid proliferation of exchanges between China and the West. 
These contacts have had a decisive impact on China's political and economic 
reforms and have been an important condition for the growth of democratic 
forces in China. 
</P>
<P>
But the anti-reform and anti-democratic forces in China immediately saw the 
implications of these exchanges. As early as 1982, they were trying to shut 
China's door to the outside. On the eve of the 12th National Party Congress in 
1982, some senior party officials proposed to stop sending Chinese students to 
Western countries and to withdraw all those already there. (They preferred to 
hire foreign scholars to teach in China.) 
</P>
<P>
With Sino-American relations in trouble in the early years of the Reagan 
Administration, these same people also proposed downgrading the level of 
Sino-American relations to that of liaison office -- the level before 1979 -- 
as a part of the process of normalizing relations with the Soviet Union. And 
they let it be known to Moscow that China would be willing to modify the three 
conditions it had set for normalization if the Soviet Union would acknowledge 
just one of them. However, Leonid Brezhnev refused the overture. The subsequent 
success of the Sino-American negotiations over Taiwan arms sales thwarted this 
attempt to change Chinese foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Now the anti-reform forces have resurrected a slogan -- "fear neither isolation 
nor blockade" -- to justify and conceal their real intention of resisting the 
worldwide trend of democratization. If the United States repeats its policy of 
the 1950s and '60s, isolating and blockading China, the outcome will be no 
different. The die-hard forces in China will be the beneficiaries of the new 
blockade. In a country as large as China, totalitarian rule cannot be ended 
through externally imposed isolation. Sanctions only strengthen the forces of 
totalitarianism. This is the unambiguous lesson of history. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the basic objective for America's China policy should be to promote 
China's further reform, openness and democratization and to break the 
self-isolation favored by the conservative forces in China. This calls for a 
three-pronged policy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promotion of Sino-American political, commercial, educational, scientific, 
artistic and cultural exchanges. In all these areas, the preference for 
self-isolation of Chinese conservatives should be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contacts should be pursued in ways that directly or indirectly help to 
eliminate the violation of human rights in China. This includes constant and 
forthright American criticism, issued both in Beijing and in Washington, of any 
inhumane treatment of the Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington should contact and support various democratic forces of China so 
long as they adhere to the principles of peacefulness, rationality and 
nonviolence as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Declaration of Human Rights. A major deficiency in American policy since June 4 
has been the insufficient support of Chinese democratic and reformist forces. 
</P>
<P>
Democratization is the fundamental solution to the human-rights problem in 
China. The road leading to democratization with the minimum cost is through a 
compromise between the existing Chinese government and various democratic 
forces. The progressive forces throughout the world should support and promote 
rather than hinder the realization of this process. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic developments in Eastern Europe forcefully demonstrated that 
democratization is an irresistible historical trend. While China differs from 
Eastern Europe both historically and culturally, the democratic movements in 
Eastern Europe and China nevertheless have close intellectual and popular 
connections. There is no reason to believe that China is destined to always be 
a totalitarian country. 
</P>
<P>
American policy toward China can be influential. Instead of treating China as a 
card to be played in partisan American politics, or resurrecting the bankrupt 
policy of isolating the country, we advocate a policy that takes realistic 
account of the complexity in promoting reform and progress in China.

HARD HEADS AND TENDER HEARTS FOR L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
LEADERSHIP: DR. KING'S LEGACY OFTEN FALLS AFOUL OF DISTRACTIONS AND CONFUSIONS. 
IN THIS DECADE, WE MUST DO BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS, Mark Ridley-Thomas is executive director of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today marks the fifth national observance of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. and Los Angeles has been one of the nation's leading communities in 
celebrating this important day of reflection and action. There is no city or 
county in the United States of America that has organized so extensive and 
diverse a series of events, activities, ceremonies, litanies, breakfasts, 
luncheons, dinners and mass demonstrations. So Los Angeles, for the most part, 
does very well when it comes to celebrating the holiday in honor of the drum 
major for peace and justice. 
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, one of the most important banks in the city, Security Pacific, has 
decided to stay open for business on this day. This act of retrenchment 
(Security Pacific reversed an earlier decision to close for the day) makes 
clear that the peace and justice agenda must be a perennial project, not just 
an annual acknowledgment. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles still has a lot to do to make the legacy of Dr. King meaningful. 
The fulfillment of his dream, so eloquently etched in hearts and minds of 
millions, is the mandate of the 1990s. This decade, the last of the 20th 
Century, poses real possibilities and challenges, and it warrants candor about 
where things are, particularly for the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
Public policy is one of the first areas in which substantial focus must be 
placed. In the words of Dr. King: "We must be hardheaded and tenderhearted." 
There is too much going on that could have a positive impact on the quality of 
life in the African American community that does not do so, because of 
confusion, inattention, distraction and self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
A few examples will suffice. First, what was a reasonable proposal to build a 
criminal justice center in South-Central Los Angeles, to better serve those who 
now have to go downtown and elsewhere, has been distorted -- wittingly and 
unwittingly -- and now the prospects for such a facility are remote at best. It 
was rumored that the center was nothing more than a dishonest way of building a 
big jail. The rumors took on a life of their own, and innuendo and suspicion 
smothered the bill that might have provided the funding for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the needs of those who could benefit from such a center go unmet. Why? 
Largely because of a lack of clarity and leadership. Further, the very notion 
of literally building a jail in a community that feels that it's already jailed 
evokes a visceral reaction that rational debate could not begin to address. The 
residents of South-Central are justifiably sensitive about the stigma 
associated with jails. South-Central does not want to be viewed as a place 
where a bunch of criminals hide-out or a place where too many residents -- 
young men in particular -- are lurking about to do their dirty deeds. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the King legacy is that the African American community has the right to 
view itself, and have others view it, in the best light, rather than by racial 
stereotypes, for prospects of peace and justice emerge out of a constructive 
view. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment is another issue of concern. In this decade, major redevelopment 
schemes will be implemented in the inner city, largely because it is the most 
undeveloped part of Los Angeles. One developer said, "It's as good as virgin 
land." Economic justice should be at the heart of the discussion about 
redevelopment. However, there can be no sense of justice without active citizen 
participation and the involvement of those who are directly affected by plans 
that portend neglect at best and rip-off at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Why isn't it possible to have more affordable housing in Los Angeles? Why can't 
the city-designated agencies make South-Central and East Los Angeles the 
priority they ought to be and then show clear results? Why can't those 
developers who traditionally relate to those agencies on behalf of 
underdeveloped communities broaden the circle, train more people and share the 
wealth? This arena needs more hard heads and tender hearts that will not 
compromise those who are most deserving and the most neglected. The quality of 
life of the city as a whole is at stake. Redevelopment must be high on the 
peace and justice agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the matter of public education is a source of constant concern and 
even dismay. There are simply too many functional illiterates in the Los 
Angeles community. This problem has reached crisis proportions in the African 
American community and substantially contributes to a decrease in the quality 
of life and to the high drop-out rates and the attendant problem of gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The recent initiatives on arresting low achievement, made on behalf of African 
American students, have not been successful in most instances and have been 
diluted to the point of meaninglessness in others. The peace and justice agenda 
in public education has to be one that inculcates critical thinking, for this 
is the key to liberation. 
</P>
<P>
The heirs of the King legacy have our work cut out for us, and there is plenty 
of it. More so than in decades gone by, the 1990s will require increased 
integrity, ingenuity and tenacity.

Brian MacLellan scored four goals and Sergei Makarov scored the winner with 
eight minutes remaining to give the Calgary Flames a 6-5 victory Sunday night 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
MacLellan, who had only three goals in 33 previous games, scored the game's 
first three goals. 
</P>
<P>
He had his fifth career hat trick and his second four-goal game. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thomas scored three times for Chicago, which had its six-game unbeaten 
string end. Thomas and Steve Larmer scored 64 seconds apart in the third 
period, making the score 5-5 at 3:34. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 6, St. Louis 5 -- Dave McLlwain scored two goals and set up Paul 
Fenton's game-winner with 2:04 remaining at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets won despite three goals by Brett Hull, who has a league-leading total 
of 41 goals in 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
It was Winnipeg's fourth consecutive victory and increased the Jets' unbeaten 
streak at home to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Brian Leetch scored at 1:16 of overtime 
to give the Rangers their 1,000th home victory.

NOAH ENDS LONG TITLE DROUGHT BY DEFEATING STEEB IN 3 SETS

Yannick Noah of France defeated Carl-Uwe Steeb of West Germany, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 
to win the men's championship in the $400,000 New South Wales Open Sunday at 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
It was Noah's first victory in nearly two years and came only three months 
after he considered retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The match took two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have gone either way," said Noah, who was seeded eighth. He rallied 
from 3-4 to win the last three games and cap a tournament in which he beat Ivan 
Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, in the quarterfinals, and defending 
champion Aaron Krickstein in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Noah, 29, praised his new coach, Dennis Ralston, a former U.S. Davis Cup 
captain, for "getting the fire back" in his play. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Noah's first since upsetting Jimmy Connors at Milan, Italy, in 
February, 1988. He earned $21,600. Steeb, seeded seventh, got $12,720. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Noah said. "It's been a long time since I won a tournament and 
now I just want to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was the first that I didn't win anything. This proves all the work I 
have been doing has been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Soviet Union's Natalia Zvereva, seeded 11th, rallied to beat 
Austrian Barbara Paulus, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the one-hour 45-minute women's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
It was Zvereva's second tournament victory. Last week, she won the Queensland 
Open at Brisbane.

STANFORD'S MCGRATH WINS IN TIEBREAKER;

Stanford's Meredith McGrath held off Trisha Laux of USC, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), to win 
the women's singles title in an invitational tournament at the Shadow Mountain 
Resort and Racquet Club Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Down a set, Laux, who had rallied from a 2-5 deficit, was serving at 6-5 with a 
chance to send the match to a third set. However, McGrath, displaying a strong 
backhand, hit a passing shot to force a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the tiebreaker, I though I was in really good shape," the 
second-seeded McGrath said. "After she came back, I knew I had to start playing 
aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, a freshman who reached the U.S. Open mixed doubles final last year, 
broke Laux's serve early and dominated the first set. However, she was unable 
to dominate the second. 
</P>
<P>
Laux, a junior, opened the second set by breaking McGrath's serve and was up, 
2-0. McGrath then won the next five games before Laux won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to be more patient and force her more," Laux said. "I warmed up 
as the match went on, (but) not fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's final, unseeded Conny Falk of Miami (Fla.) defeated top-seeded 
Jonathan Stark of Stanford, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Falk, playing an aggressive baseline game, broke Stark in the fifth game of the 
first set. After each held his serve, Falk closed out the first set when Stark 
double-faulted in the ninth game. 
</P>
<P>
"My game wasn't very sharp today," said Stark, who along with partner Alex 
O'Brien lost in the semifinals of the doubles. "The pressure of being top 
ranked got to me." 
</P>
<P>
The second set was much like the first, as Falk broke Stark twice. After 
breaking Stark in the sixth game, Falk won the next game at love to go up, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been playing well, except this tournament," Falk said. "This was the 
first time I had felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's third-seeded team of Sandra Birch and Debbie Graham defeated 
top-seeded Mamie Ceniza and Stella Sampras of UCLA, 6-1, 6-3, for the women's 
doubles title. USC's Byron Black and Kent Seton beat Shige Kanroji and Trevor 
Kronemann of UC Irvine, 1-6, 6-1, 6-3, in the men's doubles.

With his veteran opponents unable to apply any pressure, rookie Robert Gamez, 
playing on his home course, eased his way to a four-stroke victory Sunday in 
the $900,000 Tucson Open. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Gamez had a final round of two-under-par 70 to become the first 
player since Ben Crenshaw in 1973 to win in his first start as a member of the 
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
He won $162,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gamez, who passed up his final year at the University of Arizona to turn 
professional, won with a 270 total, 18 shots under par. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Rodger Davis eagled the second playoff hole to beat Curtis Strange 
and win a $625,000 tournament at Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
They tied at 17-under-par 271 after the final round. Davis closed with a 69, 
and Strange shot a 72. Strange missed a 13-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole 
that would have given him the victory.

FOREMAN-COONEY: A FIGHT FOR THE AGED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Foreman will get a chance tonight to do something some fighters would 
like to do -- punch a promoter. 
</P>
<P>
In a scheduled 10-round bout, Foreman, 41, will meet Gerry Cooney, who promoted 
two of the former heavyweight champion's fights in his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney, also on the comeback trail, promoted Foreman's fourth-round knockout of 
Carlos Hernandes at Atlantic City, and his second-round knockout of Ladislas 
Mijangos at Ft. Myers, Fla., both in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney, 33, hopes he has less trouble with Foreman than he did in his two 
promotional ventures with the punching preacher. Foreman threatened to pull out 
of both matches on fight day. 
</P>
<P>
The bout is being criticized in some quarters for exploiting the fighters and 
the paying public. Each fighter is guaranteed $1 million. Foreman is the 9-5 
favorite in the bout at the Convention Center. A crowd of 11,000 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable, however, that the winner will earn several million dollars 
more by fighting Mike Tyson for the championship, which Foreman held in 
1973-74. 
</P>
<P>
Since beginning his comeback March 9, 1987, Foreman's record is 19-0, with 18 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's weigh-in, Forman weighed 253 1/2, Cooney 231. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman's career record is 64-2, with 60 knockouts. Cooney, who failed in a 
title bid against Larry Holmes in 1982 and who has not fought since 1987, has a 
record of 28-2, with 24 knockouts.

ATHLETE'S FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Someone once asked you how he could have gotten a case of athlete's 
foot when the most strenuous thing he ever did was change the channel on his 
television set. You explained that the conditions that cause athlete's foot can 
affect anyone. 
</P>
<P>
What I would like to know is why men get it more often than women. Is it 
because there are more men athletes than women athletes? Or am I wrong that men 
get it more often? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Women do appear to be less susceptible to athlete's foot, and the 
reason seems to be the kinds of shoes they wear. Warmth and moisture are the 
principal factors associated with the risk of developing athlete's foot. It is 
these factors that account for the condition being so much more prevalent in 
the summer than at other times. 
</P>
<P>
Women, however, wear shoes that permit their feet to remain cooler and drier; 
for example, wearing open-toed shoes and sandals helps keep the feet dry. Men 
can accomplish the same thing by using powder on their feet and wearing 
absorbent socks.

The Execution of Justice by Friedrich Durrenmatt; translated by John E. Woods 
(Random House: $17.95; 216 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Swiss author Friedrich Durrenmatt, whose novels and plays have earned him 
international acclaim, has a gift for sharp and ironic observation of society, 
especially when it turns on itself and ceases to function. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Execution of Justice," his sarcasm is aimed at the judicial system. 
Crime becomes a reflection of the political and social climate, a cancer that 
arises from distorted values, from numbness and justification. 
</P>
<P>
"The Execution of Justice," written over a span of 28 years, was first 
published in 1985 in Zurich under the title "Justiz" ("Justice"). It begins 
with a voice that's charged with tension, a voice that belongs to Spat, a 
bright but poor attorney who is seduced into representing a powerful man who 
has killed and claims that he has no reason for his crime. 
</P>
<P>
Durrenmatt focuses more on politics than on the characters who play bizarre 
roles in the machinery of Swiss justice. He is highly critical of his country 
that "withdrew from history when it went into big business. . . . Our country's 
ideals were always practical ones . . . an immoral but healthy way of life." He 
looks at pompous manners and traditions, at corruption so smooth that it has 
worked its way into everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in his disturbing observation of the struggle between law and justice, 
Durrenmatt touches on flaws in the legal system in a much more global way. 
Rules have become more important than the transgressions for which the rules 
were once set up. Questions about the nature of justice abound throughout the 
novel. Is justice a "private matter? . . . and why justice? For society in 
general?" 
</P>
<P>
Durrenmatt always has been drawn to the detective novel, and "The Execution of 
Justice" carries the suspense of a detective novel as it explores a crime 
performed at a Zurich restaurant. Dr. Isaak Kohler tells his chauffeur to wait 
outside the restaurant, walks in, greets Prof. Winter "amicably" and shoots him 
in front of many witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
No motive is found, and Kohler is sentenced to 20 years. He accepts the verdict 
with dignity and adjusts to the soft prison life, studying Esperanto and 
beekeeping. The warden considers him "either a saint or a devil." 
</P>
<P>
Kohler convinces the reluctant Spat to reinvestigate the case "under the 
presumption that (he) was not the murderer . . . to create a fiction, nothing 
more." He meets the young lawyer's confusion by assuring him that he is not 
"supposed to investigate reality . . . but rather one of the possibilities 
behind the reality." 
</P>
<P>
As the murder is reinvestigated, the act of violence is removed from theory, 
and only the theory is dealt with -- a clean, passionless residue that has less 
and less to do with the crime. And this is what happens to justice too -- it 
becomes detached from its source, loses its reason for being and exhausts 
itself in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Spat finally surmises the motive for the murder, the seduction of the game, the 
"calculation and the execution, the possibility each game presented . . . to 
play not just with balls but with human beings . . . equating himself with 
God." He is certain that Kohler is a murderer and that his "motive was too 
abstract for our system of justice." On the verge of murdering his client and 
killing himself, Spat recounts the events leading to his despair and his 
twisted belief that "justice can be restored only by a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Durrenmatt's novel ends with a different voice -- that of an editor who tries 
to make sense of Spat's manuscript and interviews the other players in this 
game of justice to verify the authenticity of the manuscript. "The author, a 
lawyer, was no match for his material. The present kept interfering . . . the 
work of a dilettante." 
</P>
<P>
This last section of the novel seems deliberately unclear with paragraphs that 
run for as long as 19 pages, fusing accounts of murder and suicide to the 
extent where they become jumbled, and making dreadful statements about the 
nature of rape: "A person was only truly free when being raped." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his focus on politics, Durrenmatt has the gift to create unforgettable 
characters within a few lines: a dwarf woman who lives her sexual fantasies 
through others; a private detective who killed his mother and her lover when he 
was a boy; old Prof. Karl Knulpe and his wife, eminent sociologists, "equally 
tall, equally emaciated, equally unkempt and dirty." Inseparable in their 
private relationship, the professor and his wife are "archenemies in science, 
doing nasty battle with each other in journals; he was a great Liberal of the 
old school . . . she an impassioned Marxist known under the name Moses 
Staehelin." 
</P>
<P>
According to Durrenmatt, he goes after the kind of humor that develops from the 
tragic, "ernst genommenen Humor" (humor that is taken seriously). One of the 
best-known contemporary authors who writes in German, he has written many radio 
plays and several novels. His work also has been performed on Broadway.

S.D. HOPEFUL HAD THE RIGHT MOVES IN 'CHESS' TRYOUT 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a scene out of "A Chorus Line" when 400 female hopefuls answered the 
cattle call for the national tour of "Chess." A determined Brenda O'Brien was 
among them. Seven callbacks later, the spunky San Diego transplant was the only 
player left on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew what they wanted," she recalled in an interview from her New York 
apartment. "They lined you up in a circle, and made their selections. First it 
was only the casting agent, but from then on, each department had to OK me -- 
the director, music (director), choreographer, producers." 
</P>
<P>
The agonizing process dragged out over three weeks, but O'Brien never lost 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to keep going," she acknowledged. "It's stressful. But I've changed 
my attitude. I don't go to auditions if I don't think I really want to do the 
part. . . . I haven't had too many rejections, but if I don't get the part, I 
forget about it and go on to the next one. This time I really felt good about 
the role. I had a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Though O'Brien plays a character much older than her own 25 years in "Chess," 
she wasn't intimidated by the part. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing character roles since I was 16," she said. "I speak a lot of 
languages. Russian wasn't one of them, but I studied a lot of dialect. In 
'Chess,' I play a KGB agent, and I'm the understudy for the lead. Since a lot 
of my lines are in Russian, I not only had to learn how to act the part, I had 
to deal with another language. But that's part of the fun of it. It's more of a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The story is based on a chess showdown between an American and a Soviet in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In "Chess" -- which began its yearlong tour in Miami last Tuesday (no local 
dates are planned) -- O'Brien expects to have plenty of opportunities to step 
out of her minor role and into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"The star gets to take days off, and she'll have vacation time," O'Brien noted, 
"so I don't have to wait for her to get sick. I should get to do a lot of the 
matinees on the road." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien left a string of local successes behind when she moved to New York. 
Among them were lead roles in productions at her alma mater, United States 
International University, and professional stints with Starlight, Lawrence Welk 
Village Theatre and the now-defunct Fiesta Dinner Theater. O'Brien snared two 
local awards on the home front during those years. 
</P>
<P>
Like most performers with an eye on Broadway, O'Brien has a strong background 
in acting, singing and dancing. And her comic gifts are well-known to local 
audiences through such shows as "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Once Upon a 
Mattress." 
</P>
<P>
However, the talented triple threat is convinced that her adaptability as a 
dancer gave her the edge over the competition for "Chess." 
</P>
<P>
"In the dance audition, the choreographer did about five different styles, and 
you had to be able to pick them up quickly. The dancers (in this show) are not 
incredible ballerinas, or tap dancers. It's more stylized acting and movement, 
but you have to know a lot of different types of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to move like chess pieces, and although it's sort of dancey, you have 
to look natural," she said. "This kind of music (rock 'n' roll) is not like 
dancing in 'Oklahoma.' There's more meaning and excitement." 
</P>
<P>
"Chess" flopped on Broadway, but, as O'Brien pointed out, the goal is to make a 
triumphant return with a new, improved product. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's been rewritten. It was a success in Europe until they tinkered with 
it for Broadway. It's a much better show since they took out some of the 
confusing subplots and made the music more powerful. Tim Rice is still working 
on the lyrics. And now, with all that's been happening in the news, it's good 
timing for the show." 
</P>
<P>
The reworking is being directed by Des McAnuff, artistic director of the La 
Jolla Playhouse, whom O'Brien described as "very free and open. He lets you 
create." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the role of the KGB agent has evolved a good deal since O'Brien 
began filtering it through the prism of her own zany imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a much more serious role, but they're discovering me now," she said. 
"They're letting me try this and that to develop the character, and they're 
adding punch lines. (Svetlana) was not a humorous part, but they're finding the 
humor in me." 
</P>
<P>
Along with her offbeat flair for comedy, O'Brien has a deep, distinctive voice 
for grinding out the accented dialogue and belting out the tunes with brassy 
gusto. Her dark good looks were another plus in landing her role. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Brien discounts all those obvious assets and credits common sense for her 
early success. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I have going for me I'm finding over and over is my plain old 
common sense," she said. "It doesn't matter how talented you are, you can't 
make it without it. You have to have an understanding of people, and of the 
politics of the situation. Just knowing about the world is so important." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's focus has always extended well beyond the ABCs of acting, singing and 
dancing. She graduated as valedictorian of the School of Performing Arts at 
USIU, despite a heavy load. 
</P>
<P>
"I took history, philosophy and law, even though I didn't need those things, 
because you can't be an actress unless you know what you're acting about." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien never set her sights on superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not your fame and fortune type," she said. "I don't want a high-in-the-sky 
career. I want a long career. I'm striving to be good."

A TRADITIONAL 'TRAVIATA' IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surprises in "La Traviata," as staged Saturday night by Opera Pacific at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, were minor. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Uzan, the stage director from Montreal, had invented some distracting 
and fussy bits of action for the soprano cast as Violetta. Not incidentally, 
that excellent -- and accommodating -- soprano happened be his wife, Diana 
Soviero. 
</P>
<P>
Portraying the tragic dame aux camelias, she made a fatuous entrance at her 
sophisticated soiree playing a kiddies game, blind-man's bluff. At the feverish 
climax of "Sempre libera," she carefully tossed fake camellias about the stage, 
one of which got caught in her hoop skirt. This, no doubt, lent new meaning to 
the concept of fioratura. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in "Addio, del passato," she distorted what should have been the peak 
of pathos by smearing her cheeks with crimson makeup worthy of Pagliaccio. 
Luckily, she found some convenient 1850s Kleenex on the night stand to wipe off 
the grotesque gunk in time for her farewell to love and life. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Uzan tended to "Traviata" business as usual. Tradition, no matter 
how tired, is always preferable to innovation for its own gimmicky sake. 
</P>
<P>
The musical surprises in Costa Mesa proved more pleasant. Mark Flint, the 
propulsive conductor, had to contend with some rough playing by the so-called 
Opera Pacific Orchestra, and his rhythmic definition tended toward the flaccid. 
He persuaded his singers to venture some welcome pianissimo explorations, 
however, and he demonstrated sufficient concern for structural integrity to 
restore at least a verse of each of the flamboyant cabalettas Verdi intended 
for the Germonts. 
</P>
<P>
For once, Alfredo got to exult heroically in his temporary shame ("Oh, mio 
rimorso"). For once, the anticlimax of the second-act finale was mitigated by 
Giorgio's florid ode to familial passion ("No, non udrai rimproveri"). Under 
such conscientious stylistic circumstances, one doubly regretted the survival 
of that disruptive intermission between the scenes of Act II, not to mention 
the conventional removal of a chunk of Violetta's death scene (the embellished 
repetition of "Gran Dio! Morir si giovine"). 
</P>
<P>
The cast, for the most part, turned out to be strong. It was dominated, as any 
successful "Traviata" must be, by the courtesan with the heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Soviero might be more affecting if she could concentrate on the grand line and 
the arching climax. Nevertheless, her authority and finesse compelled 
admiration, even when her characterization got bogged down in the wrong 
histrionic minutiae. 
</P>
<P>
She sustained radiant tone and reasonable agility in the opening scenes. She 
exerted force without forcing in the dramatic outbursts of Act II ("Amami, 
Alfredo") and accented the plaintive lyricism of the last act with telling 
strokes of desperation and passion. She is a sensitive singer and a resourceful 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
Tonio di Paolo, her Alfredo, bears a disconcerting resemblance to the young 
Buddy Hackett. He has a strange habit of suddenly lapsing into tones that verge 
on a falsetto croon in passages inviting introspective nuance. Contrary to 
expectation, he chose not to assault the vocal stratosphere at the climax of 
his cabaletta. But there is potential gold in that throat. 
</P>
<P>
Di Paolo sings with poise, expressive warmth and dynamic generosity. He seems 
to care about the words. He even knows the meaning of legato. Remember his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Noble introduced a properly stern yet sympathetic Giorgio Germont who 
savored noble bel-canto values. One might wish for a bit less parlando 
declamation in "Di Provenza," or top notes that ring with greater, brighter 
impact. Still, he helps fill a painful void in the current roster of worthy 
Verdi baritones. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Protich commanded attention as a seductive Flora Bervoix. The other 
comprimarios faded into the canvas woodwork of John Conklin's workaday sets, 
borrowed from the San Francisco Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Venegas and Ramon Nunez danced a sprightly mock-bullfight duet in the 
gambling scene. The choreographer remained uncredited. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph de Rugeriis' supertitles encouraged the usual laughs in the wrong 
places, and at certain conversational junctures seemed a bit over-zealous. 
Surely, an attentive audience can be spared the instant translation of such an 
innocent utterance as "Ha ha!" 
</P>
<P>
Still, this was a good night at the opera. We have seen worse "Traviatas" in 
far more prestigious places.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: RADIO HOST MAKES A PRACTICE OF 
BAITING THE RACE BAITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two ways of looking at KSDO-AM (1130) talk-show host John Krist's 
regular Friday night segments: Either he is promoting Neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux 
Klan's mentality of racial hatred, or he is exposing them as stupid and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a regular segment, aired every Friday night since March, Krist has 
been reading letters from supremacists whom he refers to as the "Fallbrook 
Television Repair Morons," a reference to one of their well-publicized leaders, 
Fallbrook television repairman Tom Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
Given the content of the letters, the segment will never be described as a 
battle of wits. The writers usually spout off in the same frightening style 
that has characterized the Klan for 100 years, the all-too-well-known "white 
power" rants that seem a cruel anachronism in these supposedly enlightened 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Krist usually gets five to seven such letters a week. He reads them as part of 
his "Poison Pen Postals" segment, and then ridicules them. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it better to ignore them or make fun of them?" Krist asks. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously the writers don't mind Krist's comments. The letters keep coming. 
Clearly, they like the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was ever really helping them, then I would certainly not do it," Krist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the white supremacists don't always get his jokes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of scary," Krist says. "In a way, the rest of the listeners can get 
an idea of what kind of imbeciles we're dealing with here. 
</P>
<P>
"For the people who do understand, I'm putting the spotlight on the stupidity 
of the White Aryan Resistance." 
</P>
<P>
Krist also includes comments from a character named Buckeroo, described as 
Fallbrook's Favorite Scotsman, who writes his own poems mocking racism. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few weeks, Krist has stopped reading the letters, in deference to 
the bombings in the South, which have been linked to white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was the sensitive thing to do, if you will" he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of KUSI-TV's station manager, William Moore, apparently will be 
decided after a review of the station's operation, according to statements made 
at a Thursday press conference by Ted Vallas, who has replaced Channel 51's 
Michael McKinnon as station president. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is rumored to be on his way out, is a longtime compatriot of 
McKinnon, whose consulting contract with the station expired Sunday. It hasn't 
been renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McKinnon and representatives of financially troubled United States 
International University, which owns 74% of the station to McKinnon's 26%, 
continue to squabble over the station's future. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say they have offered to buy the other's share, and both say the 
other's offers are unreasonable. The station still owes McKinnon $6.2 million 
in start-up money. McKinnon also owns most of the station's equipment. He 
recently filed suit against the station, asking return of the equipment and 
damages. Last Thursday, the station filed a reply, charging McKinnon with, 
among other things, unfairly negotiating for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
Vallas, who has been meeting with station department heads recently, said the 
university has offered McKinnon $10 million for his share, minus the debt. 
McKinnon said Thursday he has received no written offers. 
</P>
<P>
McKinnon, who has the right to match any offer for the university's shares, has 
offered $13 million for the 74%, Vallas said. In addition, McKinnon said he 
would pick up the $6.2 million in debt. The offer was refused. 
</P>
<P>
Vallas said the station has been appraised at $46 million, and its cash flow is 
about $3 million a year. McKinnon said both figures are too high. Generally, 
the value of a station is placed at eight to 10 times its cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Vallas, owner of a small airline company and three North County country clubs, 
said the appraisal was high because of the station's potential. 
</P>
<P>
Vallas says McKinnon blocked attempts by the university to arrange financing, 
secured by their shares in the TV company, to repay McKinnon. The university 
can't put up its shares for collateral without the 81% approval of the 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"My question is: What is their business plan?" McKinnon asked. "What are their 
long-range goals? What are they going to do with the station?" 
</P>
<P>
Both sides accuse the other of shirking its responsibilities to the station. 
</P>
<P>
"He has reason for personal gain, we have nothing to gain," Vallas said. 
</P>
<P>
The station's board of directors is scheduled to meet Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The university has never been involved in the operations of the station, which 
was under McKinnon's control. Thursday Vallas said the only decision the 
university ever blocked was a move several years ago to do nightly newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
As the latest ratings foretold, Channel 39 has put "Geraldo" on hiatus, which 
means people will have to look elsewhere for discussions about transvestites 
who ski and the dangers of mud wrestling. Starting today, "Geraldo" will be 
replaced in the 4-5 p.m. slot by "Inside Report" and "Hard Copy." Putting a 
program on hiatus is a cute way for the station to say that it still owns 
rights to the show, but would rather air something that people might watch. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM's (91X) Russ T. Nailz has taped another segment of "Evening at the 
Improv," his third appearance on the syndicated show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KCBQ-FM (105.3) is organizing a reunion of the station's on-air personalities 
from the last 30 years. Already confirmed are Dean Goss, Shotgun Tom Kelly, 
Rich Brother Robin, Gary Kelly and Ralph James, who went on the air with KCBQ 
in 1955. The jocks will gather Feb. 14 to wade through the nostalgia, 
broadcasting from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A new edition of the "Festival of Animation" is screening at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art, Friday through Monday, through March. This year's 
lineup includes films by John Lasseter ("Pixar"), Tim Burton ("Batman") and 
Bill Plympton ("25 Ways to Quit Smoking"). . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based Noble Broadcast Group, owners of XTRA, has appointed Howard 
Freedman as vice president of programming, to "oversee all programming, 
promotion and research activities." He has served as marketing and research 
director for Noble for the past year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Barry Paris, author of a recent biography of silent-screen star Louise Brooks, 
will lecture after a Wednesday screening of Brooks' "Prix De Beaute," at the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The screening is at 7:30 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This month's edition of KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) "Third Thursday," scheduled 
Thursday at 6:30 p.m., will focus on AIDS, "Facts, Fears and the Future."

A Tomorrow for 'Annie 2'?: In the wake of negative reviews and an equally 
negative audience response at the Kennedy Center in Washington last week, it's 
clear that "Annie 2," the $7-million sequel to the Broadway hit, "Annie," is in 
deep trouble. Reached by telephone at his Washington hotel over the weekend, 
co-producer Roger S. Berlind declined to talk about the show, but he said that 
he and his associates were meeting around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright and Dramatists Guild president Peter Stone, a Broadway veteran, went 
to Washington last week with directors Tommy Tune and Mike Nichols to offer 
their opinions on how the production might be saved. Stone says he, Tune and 
Nichols went simply as friends and will play no role in doctoring the musical. 
Stone refused any comment on the show's problems, but he acknowledged that its 
producers are "fighting for their lives" and added that the show has no chance 
of surviving on any lingering popularity of "Annie" if it can't stand on its 
own merits. The production is scheduled to open in New York in March. SHAUNA

'LEATHERFACE': MASSACRED SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1974, Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" crawled out of the 
hinterlands, reeking and screaming, a low-budget regional horror movie about a 
family of demented slaughterhouse workers turned cannibals that slashed its way 
into the public and critical light. Now, 16 years later, with one failed sequel 
in between, comes "Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III" (citywide), 
minus Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel, minus the original cast, minus 
everything but the plot -- shamelessly looted and stripped of everything but 
its bare, bloody essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two decades after the original massacre, new director Jeff Burr and 
screenwriter David Schow would have us believe that the cannibal family is 
still operating, undetected, in their woodsy farmhouse. None of the events of 
the 1986 "T. C. Massacre 2" -- in which the kill-crazy bunch opened up a string 
of barbecue houses and an amusement park -- seem to have affected anyone. 
Perhaps that episode was all a bad dream. 
</P>
<P>
But this third one, a complete retrenchment, is no bad dream at all. It's just 
vapid deja vu. Every basic scene or plot element is repeated doggedly. This 
opportunistic, empty, often illogical sequel, is done without the crazy energy 
or stylistic volatility of its predecessors, executed with the grim wariness of 
an apprentice butcher who wants to keep his ax clean. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, hordes of low-budget horror movies have copied Hooper's nubile 
teens-vs-crazed killers form -- and then replicated themselves endlessly, like 
rotting toadstools on a felled tree. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't catch horror in a bottle -- especially a recycled one. 
"Leatherface" (MPAA-rated R, for language and violence) is as tasteless as its 
predecessors, but it reduces fear to a business and blood to a drip. It's a 
slaughterhouse without any real buzz.

Cable Company Drops MTV: A cable television company in South Dakota has deleted 
the MTV music video channel because of complaints about offensive videos, the 
company manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was an organized effort or people just decided to call at 
the same time, but we got a large number of requests all of a sudden from these 
areas to remove the service," said Doug Bierschbach, manager of Satellite Cable 
TV Systems. Last month, the company stopped offering MTV in Parkston or 
Freeman, towns of about 1,300 each. MTV was replaced by the Discovery Channel. 
Bierschbach said his office has since received about a dozen complaints from 
young viewers. SHAUNA SNOW and BETH KLEID

POP CAPSULES : LOSTBOYS FINDING THEIR HEAVY-METAL NICHE

<TEXT>
<P>
How do you remold a generic Valley-metal band into a rough, tough posse of 
Hollywood rockers? Like, say, convert Odin -- the youthful band that Bill 
Gazzarri kept calling a "foxy bunch of guys" in the film 'Decline of Western 
Civilization Part II: The Metal Years" -- into the bikeresque Lostboys, who 
headlined the Roxy on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
You could decorate the mike stands with plants, place lighted candles by the 
drum kit, plaster the clothing with drawings of Jesus and talk a lot about "the 
streets" between songs. 
</P>
<P>
You also could have lead singer Randy O learn his moves by watching Guns N' 
Roses videos and write choruses that go something like this: "Lonely, lonely, 
lonely, lonely. . . ." You could also have the band be managed by street-smart 
mogul Vicky Hamilton, who helped launch GN'R, Poison and Faster Pussycat. 
</P>
<P>
And it almost works. The Lostboys' bottom-heavy hard-rock tunes don't have the 
vocal hooks or monster riffs of a Guns N' Roses, but the band is well rehearsed 
and appears ready to spend the next year opening arena shows for Kix or 
whatever. With the right video, these guys could be as big as -- and probably 
about as interesting -- as, say Warrant. JONATHAN GOLD

POP CAPSULES : BUIRSKI: INTENSE ANGUISH AT MCCABE'S

<TEXT>
<P>
Want to add a little intensity to your life? 
</P>
<P>
Try an evening with Felicity Buirski, who played McCabe's on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
She's one of the latest buzzes on the female-confessional-singer-songwriter 
front. 
</P>
<P>
How's a title like "Internal Bleeding" grab you? Or any of a darkened boudoir 
full of songs -- in both first and third person -- about women who have allowed 
themselves to be used by men and grew to hate themselves (and the men) for it. 
Not exactly first-date entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the ilk tend to comfort listeners with the knowledge that the pain is 
universal. Buirski makes people decidedly uncomfortable in the interest of 
existential nurturing. 
</P>
<P>
The experience was part empathy, part catharsis and part emotional voyeurism -- 
all very comparable to Buirski's obvious mentor Leonard Cohen. But where 
Cohen's dry, stately delivery keeps his anguish earthbound, Buirski's forceful, 
husky voice -- complemented by two violinists -- sometimes sends it spinning 
into the ionosphere. Which is both good (because you have to go chase after it) 
and bad (because some people won't bother). STEVE HOCHMAN

'MARTIN' ADDS NOTHING TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disjointed melodrama about a plaster saint gunned down by a crazed monster, 
Gordon Parks' "Martin" ballet relies on what the audience already feels about 
its subject, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the struggle for civil rights. This 
hourlong PBS dance drama airs tonight at 10 on Channel 28 and 11 on Channel 15. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 50 shows it on Wednesday at 10, Channel 24 Thursday at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Parks composed the brooding score for the ballet, fashioned the libretto from 
incidents in King's public life, appears as host and narrator, serves as 
executive producer and director, plays keyboards and supplies the gritty, 
documentary photographs shown at the beginning of the program -- images 
inevitably more intense and authentic than anything in the ballet itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the scenes offer no opportunities for dancing, and choreographer Rael 
Lamb dutifully supplies the pantomime or processional action required. 
Elsewhere he borrows from masterworks of the 1940s by Agnes de Mille and Antony 
Tudor for vignettes of small-town life or passages of soul-searching by the 
King character. His use of the classical vocabulary is fluent but there's 
little expressive insight in the choreography and virtually no suggestion of 
black culture. 
</P>
<P>
John Jones brings great integrity and strong technical skills to the impossibly 
Christ-like role of King. (There's even a Resurrection scene.) Sheila Rohan 
humanizes some of the ballet's emptiest choreography as Rosa Parks, initially 
victimized and later a King apostle. James Edward Murphy plays the Assassin 
like something out of a teen-slasher movie -- wouldn't it be great if all 
dangerous bigots were this conspicuous? LEWIS SEGAL

'UNSPEAKABLE ACTS': DRAMATIC TENSION LIES IN TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When something comes along like "Unspeakable Acts" (at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 
3, 10 and 42), it raises anew the problem of how to assess the television 
docudrama with which we have been blessed/cursed these last decades of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
This movie covers, with meticulous care, the horrific child rapes in Country 
Walk, Fla., circa 1984, and the subsequent trial, which ended with the first 
successful prosecution in the nation of a day-care operator on multiple abuse 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In one prereview, a national magazine gave the film a "C" because it lacks 
"dramatic tension." Which is like saying that Vietnam wasn't a very good war 
because not enough people got killed. 
</P>
<P>
You wonder, what are the best camera angles to tell the assassination in 
Dallas? 
</P>
<P>
Or, how important is good lighting and cohesive editing in order for us to 
enjoy the depiction of life at Auschwitz? 
</P>
<P>
Is the play the thing or the facts of the matter? 
</P>
<P>
In "Unspeakable Acts," Ellen Landsburg's script reflects the deadly accuracy of 
the exhaustive book of the same name by Jan Hollingsworth. Linda Otto, who 
produced "Adam," directs with dynamic effect and coaxes especially affecting 
performances from the several children. The film is testimony that such matters 
can successfully be brought to trial. That's the dramatic tension: that this is 
all too unrelentingly true. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with suspicions spreading through the little suburb -- then 
exploding into denial, then confusion, then panic. Dade County has the luck 
and/or wisdom to summon Miami child psychologists Laurie and Joe Braga (played 
by Jill Clayburgh and Brad Davis), who figured this might be some sort of minor 
molesting. 
</P>
<P>
But the succession of one child after another -- through patient, delicate 
questioning, 49 video tapes worth -- reveals the scope of the scandal. 
Prosecutors relate that the children's statements allege more than 500 counts 
of sexual abuse -- but they will avoid what they refer to as the "mistakes made 
in the McMartin case," among them limiting the charges to a few dozen. 
</P>
<P>
This case took 15 months from arrest to conviction, including five weeks for 
trial. The courts have had the McMartin Pre-School molestation case -- Southern 
California's contribution to such repugnant affairs -- for more than six years. 
A decision is expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
When the McMartin case comes to its inevitable re-enactment on TV, someone's 
surely going to come along and say that the script needs tightening. . . . IRV

Virginia Wing, 45 
</P>
<P>
Actress, mother of two 
</P>
<P>
Fourth generation 
</P>
<P>
Born in Mississippi 
</P>
<P>
"Being a Chinese in Mississippi was really tough in some ways because you never 
knew where you stood. I was fortunate in that my family came over at the turn 
of the century, so I had uncles who were sheriffs and mayors of towns. In my 
hometown, there's a street named after my uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"The South was really black and white, so you had to belong to one or the 
other. In my particular hometown, we were considered white because we didn't 
have to sit in the back of the movie theater or drink out of other fountains. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I would go to another town in Mississippi, in those towns we were 
considered black. So it was kind of an iffy situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it wasn't all positive either because I wasn't very daring. I don't 
think Chinese are raised to be very daring. We're raised really to be 
conformists. 
</P>
<P>
"So I think that any creative spirit I had was tempered a lot by my Chinese 
upbringing. I guess the most daring thing I did was to get out of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a survivalist instinct in them (her parents) that they needed 
to do things in the American way to survive, especially in that society they 
had to belong as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother became a Southern Baptist; I was raised in a Southern Baptist 
church. And I was things like homecoming queen, things that Chinese girls just 
weren't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of my problems in acting has been that I'm not really Chinese. My 
whole chemistry is very American. I think roles are written for Chinese or 
Asians but not Asian-Americans and not Chinese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"At heart, I'm really Chinese, but there are so many overlays. My ex-husband 
was Jewish, and I'm very comfortable with blacks. I'm just a mixture of a lot 
of things, but I guess basically I am Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have to say some lines that you can hardly believe that you're 
saying like, 'Buddha bless you,' or, 'Buddha be with you,' those kinds of 
things. But I think things are a little more open now. You can say to a 
director that, you know, one would not say this. 
</P>
<P>
"Assimilating -- you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't in some 
ways. If you assimilate in a business where your reason for being is because 
you're Chinese, if you assimilate into the mainstream too much, you are no 
longer that product. I would work a lot more if I had an accent and was very 
Chinese. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I have a friend who is black, and she cannot tap dance. It's not 
that she doesn't have the ability to tap dance, it's because there's something 
in her psyche that says, 'You people have made me tap dance; my people tap 
dance too much.' I guess there's a little of that in me." Jonathan Gaw

Came from Taiwan in 1980 
</P>
<P>
(Through a translator)

<P>
"I brought my family here because it would be a better place to raise my 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"All my relatives are in the East. 
</P>
<P>
But I live here because it's easier for me to develop here. I needed to go 
where there are a lot of Asians. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into this profession because I am handicapped (polio) and this is the 
only efficient way. And, I know that this career will help society by 
counseling and by giving people emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition didn't make me feel any different from when I was in Taiwan, 
because I had a lot of clients. Not until I bought my first house and as my 
children grew up I had to deal with their education and the mortgage . . . 
then, I knew I had a changed environment. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, I knew what America was really about. But, it's not hard to 
adapt here. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times when Asians come here and they don't know where to start or how to 
start a job here. Many of the problems are based on financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People often ask me about their investments. For example, if they should buy a 
house. The answer depends on each case. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first came to the U.S., one of my sisters came for two weeks to help 
us out. After that, we were on our own. When she left I met several friends who 
lived here and they helped me.

GROUP PROMOTES AMERICAN TRADITION OF INVOLVEMENT

Nearly 90% of its members speak Chinese, but leaders of the Chinese American 
Assn. of Southern California make it a point to conduct meetings in English. 
</P>
<P>
"We are Americans of Chinese descent," said spokeswoman Yvonne Liu, a 
first-generation American. "We are proud to be Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983, the Palos Verdes Estates-based group is united in the belief 
that success in the United States means more than economic and educational 
advancement; it also means community involvement and political activism. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids are just like Americans, only their face is different," said 
Elizabeth Szu, a group founder and immigrant from Taiwan. "We have to teach 
them if you want to stay in this country, you have to merge with the 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
A struggling student when she moved to this country 20 years ago, Szu realizes 
new immigrants are often preoccupied with making a living and adjusting to a 
new culture. But once they settle down and become financially secure, she said, 
it is crucial to be active in their communities and the political process. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to pay our dues," Szu said. "If sometimes (Anglos) treat you like 
second-class citizens, it's because you're not active in this community." 
</P>
<P>
The association, which has about 400 members from Mission Viejo to Thousand 
Oaks, devotes most of its energy and resources to political activities, such as 
nonpartisan fund-raising for candidates sympathetic to Chinese-American 
concerns and lobbying against anti-Asian violence and prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as chairman of the group's political awareness committee in 1988, 
Szu's husband Charles succeeded in getting the California Republican Party to 
support a resolution opposing apparent university quotas restricting the 
admission of Asian-American students. 
</P>
<P>
When the movies "Year of the Dragon" and "Sixteen Candles" featured disparaging 
portrayals of Asian-Americans and perpetuated negative stereotypes, the 
association bombarded studio executives with letters and telephone calls to 
voice their anger.

CHINESE LANGUAGE IMMERSION CLASSES HELP MELD 2 CULTURES

No longer are they dragged to Chinese lessons on Saturdays or after school, 
while their friends get to watch cartoons and play. Learning Cantonese is a 
no-fuss process at the West Portal Chinese Immersion Program in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's only public school Chinese immersion program, about 150 
students get Cantonese, along with the usual math, history and science. About 
40% of the students are "ABCs" -- American-born Chinese -- while the rest are 
Anglos, Latinos, blacks or of mixed ethnicities. They come from throughout the 
city to the program in West Portal School in the Sunset District. 
</P>
<P>
The school district started the program six years ago, spurred by parents who 
wanted their children to learn Chinese without the headaches of hauling them to 
lessons outside of school. 
</P>
<P>
Ling-chi Wang said that his wife was pregnant, and "I decided not to put my 
third child through what my two older children had to go through -- 10 years of 
after-school Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
Now the third child, 6-year-old Wei-ying, is steeped in Cantonese and English, 
and "it's not a fuss that she has to (learn) both," said Wang, a professor at 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Parents were also backed by reports of the success of French immersion programs 
in Canada and the fact that San Francisco had set up a Spanish immersion 
program the year before, said Winnie Tang, a parent and a staff development and 
instructional administrator for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The program has grown along with its children, adding a grade every year so 
that it now runs from kindergarten to fifth grade. Next year, sixth grade will 
be offered at a middle-school campus, along with intensive Spanish and Japanese 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is not to translate but to teach Cantonese, along with content. In the 
immersion's kindergarten, for instance, the teacher explains in Cantonese what 
sinks and what floats, demonstrating with a tub of water and then asking the 
class questions in Cantonese. The children pick up a scientific concept, as 
well as words such as "sink," "water," "sponge" and "rock." 
</P>
<P>
Instruction in kindergarten is 80% in Chinese and 20% English, which tapers to 
50-50 by fifth grade, Tang said. She said her fifth-grade daughter in the 
program speaks Cantonese "somewhat fluently." 
</P>
<P>
The immersion pupils join the 400 regular-classroom students at West Portal for 
recess, field trips and special projects, principal Jeanne Villafuerte said. 
Last fall, the program offered 33 kindergarten seats instead of the usual 30, 
but even so, seven parents had to be turned away.

NOT HERE: Air travelers could be taxed $2 or $3 each time they board a flight, 
the money going for local airport development, if the nation's airport 
operators get their way. . . . Sentiment for a departure tax is building in 
Washington -- but not at John Wayne Airport, despite its $310-million 
expansion. . . . Even if Congress authorized the tax, "we already have our 
sources of funding lined up," Airport Manager George A. Rebella said. "We

'PIONEER' BLACK ACTIVIST REFLECTS ON O.C. PROGRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
On a Friday evening in 1963, a couple from a neighborhood in Orange phoned Los 
Angeles residents Ken and Jo Caines and asked to visit. The couple arrived, 
accepted a cup of coffee and offered the Caineses $500 not to move to their 
block. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't prejudice, the visitors explained nervously. It was, said the couple, 
the fact that two minority families -- one black and one Asian -- already lived 
on their block, and residents felt that it would be more difficult to sell 
their homes at top prices if there were three. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as the county observes Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, Jo Caines sees 
a more hospitable -- but still less than ideal -- climate for blacks in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel things are better. But there is still discrimination and prejudice," 
said Caines, 60, an active member of two dozen community organizations and 
director of community relations for KOCE-TV, Channel 50, the county's public 
television station. "Opportunities still have to be opened so we can have a 
piece of the pie." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone outside Orange County looking in would see what appears to be progress: 
two black college presidents and more black families who earn at least $50,000 
than most other places. But inside, blacks earn 70% that of whites, similar to 
the national average, according to the Urban League. Their numbers hover at 1% 
or less of the population compared with 12.2% nationally. There are no elected 
black officials in the county, and black youths suffer high drop-out and 
unemployment rates. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while some black families have congregated in Irvine, Huntington 
Beach, Fullerton and Santa Ana, the majority are middle-class families 
scattered throughout the county without a tangible community, making social 
life difficult, particularly for young adults. 
</P>
<P>
"The black population in Orange County is different," Caines said. "We have a 
small poverty pocket. Most are upper or middle class and have fulfilled that 
dream -- buying a home and living where you want." But consequently, she said, 
"We're everywhere. We can't find each other." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of social isolation, some have moved out. But those who have stayed 
regard the Caineses as hardy pioneers in what was once the nearly all-white 
frontier of suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
Subhead Here 
</P>
<P>
Jo Caines calls herself a "mutt," a "black," whose ancestors included a Jewish 
white grandmother, an Indian great-grandfather as well as Nat Turner, the 
infamous 19th-Century black preacher who was hanged following a slave rebellion 
in which 60 Virginia whites were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to call myself black; I wouldn't be Jo Caines without all that." 
</P>
<P>
But, born into a Philadelphia family with a few wealthy relatives, she knows 
she has not suffered as did the Southern blacks. "I would never put myself in 
that category," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was raised the only child of restaurateurs who valued education and gave 
her a strong sense of self-esteem, making her feel that she was the most 
important thing in their lives, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Caines faced prejudice from white teachers who thought she should not go to 
college, as well as jealousy from less fortunate black girls who taunted her 
about the fancy "pencil curls" her father put in her long hair. "My mom and dad 
always told me to turn the other cheek," she said. They said, 'They have 
problems and you have to understand them.' " 
</P>
<P>
With top grades and an outgoing personality, Caines majored in English and 
drama at New York University, where she met her husband, Ken, a native of the 
West Indies, whose parents were homeowners in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we didn't want to bring our kids up in New York," she said. "We wanted 
more open space." 
</P>
<P>
Their odyssey took them first to Denver, then to Lompoc and Los Angeles and 
finally Orange County where they had found their $27,500 dream house. It was a 
glass-walled atrium tract home built by Los Angeles architects A. Quincy Jones 
and Frederick E. Emmons and marketed by the progressive developer Joseph 
Eichler, whom the Caineses knew as a pioneer in qualifying buyers equally, 
regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
But when the neighbors heard that a second black family was moving in, they 
became scared, recalled Joyce Conrad, who lives across the street. "The 
neighbors thought it was blockbusting, like in Chicago where a black would move 
in, the whites would leave, more blacks would move in and get the houses for 
less." While some wanted to meet them "and judge them on their own merits," 
others supported the couple who made the $500 offer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Caines said her husband jokingly asked for $2,500 and then politely refused, 
saying, "You can't offer us anything. We want to be good neighbors and good 
friends of yours." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, they attended a meeting in the neighborhood to discuss their 
impending move. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken spoke of the logic of our decision: that the center of the tract was safer 
for the kids to play and that the lots were larger," Jo Caines recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very dramatic. I said, 'Believe me, we love like you love. We bleed like 
you bleed.' They still talk about that," she said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken was absolutely wonderful, Jo was warm and human," Conrad recalled. 
"Everyone liked her immediately." The Caineses blended into the tight-knit 
neighborhood and have made close friends through 27 years of neighborhood 
potlucks, songfests and teen-age bands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Caines children were the only blacks in their elementary schools. They ran 
into problems only later when they reached dating age and some white parents 
balked at interracial dating, Caines said. To help their daughter socially, 
Caines said, they sent her to interracial summer camps run by the National 
Council for Catholics and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Both her son and daughter eventually married whites, Caines said. Although 
Caines taught them that "people are people" and "skin color comes second," she 
said she teases her other son that she hopes he finds a black wife. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the civil rights movement, Caines said, she was a sympathizer but 
not a demonstrator. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not marchers. We were writers of letters." 
</P>
<P>
Caines said blacks need three types of leaders -- the radicals, who can get 
people's attention; the educators, who can make people understand issues of 
poverty, inequality, unemployment and housing; and people like herself, who 
help create policies, get involved with traditional organizations and 
institutions, who can "make an impact where the power is." 
</P>
<P>
As a community activist, she said, she was able to make people listen by saving 
her most ardent appeals for the causes that mattered to her most: the creation 
of the Orange County Fair Housing Council, the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the Human Relations Commission, the county's civil rights office. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, a management consultant, also became involved in city politics. He 
waged unsuccessful campaigns in 1972 and 1978 for City Council. They do not 
believe race was a factor in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Her son Chris was elected student body president of Villa Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
Jo served on the Orange County Grand Jury, the board of the United Way, 
numerous councils, commissions and advisory boards including the African 
American Council of the Historical and Cultural Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In United Way, she said, she encourages the board not to cross off 
inexperienced grass-roots minority organizations for grants if they provide a 
needed service. At the same time, she said, she discourages a "poor me" 
attitude among minorities looking for funds. "You ask because it is a community 
need, not because 'we're poor blacks and you owe us.' You come with your head 
high, your shoulders back and say, 'This is a need in our community.' " 
</P>
<P>
Caines has received so many awards over the years that the plaques no longer 
fit on her office wall and pile up in boxes underneath a table. 
</P>
<P>
Caines said one black group rejected her several times for an award because 
they thought she was not "black enough." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't live in a black community. I didn't go to a black church," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was helping the blacks, but also the disenfranchised, women and children (of 
other races)." 
</P>
<P>
Women's groups who also wanted her to get involved solely with their 
organizations have been equally disappointed, Caines said. "I had to 
concentrate on the whole ball of wax," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For blacks to succeed in Orange County, Caines said, they must pull together 
with other minorities. "We're spread so thin, we need to develop partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana took forever to get a black on the school board," she said, 
referring to Sadie Reid-Benham, who has moved to Los Angeles. "It's almost 
written: The minorities cancel each other out. We need to say, 'This year, 
we'll support you, black candidate. Next year, we'll support you, Hispanic 
candidate.' " 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said it's important to teach about black contributions to make 
sure black youngsters appreciate their culture heritage. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps most of all, she said, blacks need to follow the example of Martin 
Luther King Jr. and demonstrate that prejudice against one minority is harmful 
to all.

TRADING EAST: With the Iron Curtain down, Western companies want to figure out 
how to trade profitably with the East Bloc (D4). . . . The key question, says 
Jim Harrell of Intertrade in Laguna Niguel: "What does a country do that does 
not have currency, but needs things that take hard currency to buy?" . . . 
Harrell has negotiated complex deals involving Poland, Romania, the Soviet 
Union, China and Cambodia. . . . In one, U.S. medical gear was sent to the 
Soviet Union for raw cotton, which was milled in Mexico and sent to China, 
where it was turned into K mart sweat shirts. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

OFFICIALS STUDY HOTELS-FOR-HOMELESS PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: A COUNTY PANEL WILL EXPLORE THE IDEA OF DEVELOPING 
SINGLE-ROOM-OCCUPANCY HOTELS AS A SOURCE OF HOUSING FOR BURGEONING NUMBERS OF 
ELDERLY, HOMELESS AND WORKING POOR RESIDENTS.

<P>
Mike and Luann Mitchell pulled into Orange County six months ago and 
immediately knew they had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Newly arrived from Michigan, Mike, without a job, and Luann, four months 
pregnant, had bright hopes of building a new future but they had nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of sleeping in their cramped car, the Mitchells moved into a seedy 
Anaheim motel, joining thousands of other low-income residents who either 
remain homeless or are forced to live in poorly maintained, ill-equipped motels 
because they cannot afford the area's high rents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents like the Mitchells, however, may soon be offered a significant new 
housing option if a plan being forged by Orange County officials is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Those officials want to build single-room-occupancy hotels, called SROs, a 
once-maligned type of low-income housing that is enjoying a renaissance around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty or 70 years ago, they were a home to traveling salesmen or other 
wayfarers, gradually decaying into the dirty, paint-chipped, torn-furniture 
refuge of people with little hope of anything better. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, they were the first target of the redeveloper's bulldozer. But 
now, in an ironic turnabout, many communities see them as an attractive, cheap 
source of housing for burgeoning numbers of elderly, homeless and working poor 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, city officials have placed moratoriums on demolition of 
existing residential hotels. And the city of San Diego has established a model 
SRO program, with 2,500 new units built or under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials last week announced plans to form a task force that 
will explore the idea of developing SRO hotels based on the San Diego model. 
</P>
<P>
"If done with care and quality, we can put low-income housing in a community 
like Orange County where the cost of land is very expensive," said Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel H. Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton have been the key backers 
of the SRO concept in Orange County, visiting and talking with San Diego 
housing officials and trying to persuade colleagues that SROs are feasible -- 
even in traditionally conservative Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But SROs are not without controversy. Orange County homeless advocates who 
favor SRO development point to numerous recent instances of social service 
groups being locked out of communities by neighbors who fear increased crime 
and other disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Many officials are likely to be reluctant to embrace the idea of building what 
are essentially hotels for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cities will want to participate, maybe even provide funds, but the 
crux will be finding places for them to be built," said Susan Oakson, 
coordinator of homeless programs for the Orange County Homeless Issues Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he hopes to get support from all 29 cities in the county to build at 
least one 200-unit SRO in each city. But he acknowledged that many communities 
will initially be wary. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot of education," he said. "But one of the secrets of the 
success is that these hotels will be located along commercial boulevards and 
not in residential neighborhoods. They will be as compatible with a community's 
profile as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many housing officials are now realizing that they must convince the 
public that low-income housing offers advantages to a community. 
</P>
<P>
If a city is faced with large numbers of homeless people who have nowhere to 
sleep but the local park, residents risk loosing that resource, said Joe 
Carreras, a senior housing planner with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. "If a community doesn't address that problem, it won't go away," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many developers and business owners have expressed interest in the concept of 
SROs for the same reason, said Bart Hansen, a partner in Shawntana Development 
and a board member of the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substandard Housing 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by increasing numbers of immigrants, the stock of substandard housing 
has risen. At the same time, the county has developed virtually no subsidized 
low-income housing and is not likely to do so in the future, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think SROs would hit the need where the need is," Hansen said. "This kind of 
concept goes hand in hand with business development." 
</P>
<P>
Young said successful development of SROs in Orange County is predicated on 
their being privately owned and funded. Many of the projects would probably be 
built by for-profit developers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But many housing advocates and SRO experts say private ownership is fraught 
with the potential for problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some private owners have failed to maintain their buildings and have provided 
inadequate management, they say. And SROs built by for-profit developers tend 
to be priced too high for the tenants who really need them. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of nonprofit ownership is that it is set up for a social purpose 
to eliminate a social problem," Carreras said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SRO Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"A for-profit developer will get whatever the market bears," said Andy 
Raubeson, executive director of the Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp. of Los 
Angeles. "If the rents average $420 a month and general relief is $220, then 
the person who must depend on general relief is not going to be able to live in 
SROs." 
</P>
<P>
The corporation is a nonprofit agency funded by Los Angeles' Community 
Redevelopment Agency and is one of the largest single owners of SROs. The group 
owns 12 residential hotels -- the oldest dates back to 1889 and most were built 
just after the turn of the century -- which have been renovated to meet the 
needs of the elderly, mentally ill and recovering alcoholics as well as other 
low-income tenants. The group also is involved in building new units. 
</P>
<P>
Raubeson said rents average $175 to $200. The SROs have been effective in both 
taking people off the streets and providing a safety net for those precariously 
perched on the edge of homelessness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are people for whom one crisis, like losing a job or a serious illness, 
would mean the difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that development of SROs would also benefit a broad range of Orange 
County's neediest residents and that participation of nonprofit organizations 
would be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a whole variety of ways of financing, owning and operating 
the projects," he said. "In Santa Ana, for example, we would hope to be able to 
work with the YWCA, which now operates a shelter for homeless women, and 
convert that into an SRO, a transitional facility." 
</P>
<P>
And Young noted that the San Diego SRO program, on which the Orange County 
project would be based, has had great success. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego effort grew out of a desire to preserve existing SROs, but 
sponsors quickly realized that the problem was not one of preservation but of 
inadequate supply, said Judith Lenthall, director of the city's SRO program. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, about 2,500 privately owned SRO units have been developed in the 
city. Rents average about $275 a month. Occupancy rates have remained at or 
near capacity, said Lenthall. 
</P>
<P>
Each room is furnished and contains a built-in wall unit with a toilet and 
sink, a closet, refrigerator and television. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the hotels, tenants share shower facilities located on each floor. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of San Diego's hotel residents revealed that about 33% were elderly 
and on some sort of fixed income, another third were working poor and about 20% 
were disabled and dependent on disability income. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't solve homelessness, but people in the hotels would surely otherwise 
be out on the streets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been stigmas attached to SROs in the past, evidenced by such 
terms as "flophouses" or "fleabag hotels," Lenthall said most residents are 
grateful for -- and proud of -- their new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Stigma' 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing negative about this," she said. "It's not low-income housing 
that they are forced to live in by some government program. There's no stigma 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall, who presented details of the San Diego project to members of the 
Orange County chapter of the League of Cities last week, said she is likely to 
become more intimately involved in local SRO development when she assumes 
duties as president of the organization Builders for People next week. 
</P>
<P>
The group, a nonprofit arm of the Building Industry Assn., will sponsor 
development of emergency housing, including SROs, in Southern California.

WATER DISTRICT DEAL FOR PUMPS DRAWS CRITICISM; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITY COSTS: AGENCY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT BOUGHT $1.3 MILLION IN EQUIPMENT 
BASED ON AN ERROR-FILLED REPORT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of Orange County's largest public water agency acknowledge using an 
error-filled staff report last summer to justify buying $1.3 million in pumps 
and valves from a Laguna Niguel company without seeking competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the company's competitors said in recent interviews with The Times 
Orange County Edition that they could have provided the same equipment for at 
least $450,000 less. Two of the competitors fired off letters to the Orange 
County Water District last fall demanding to know why they were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
"The award of purchase contracts of this magnitude . . . without the benefit of 
competitive market pricing would not appear to be in the interest of the 
district," wrote Johann J. Leppitsch, president of KSB Inc., a West German pump 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Created by an act of the state Legislature in 1933, the Fountain Valley-based 
district sells water wholesale from an underground storage basin to retail 
agencies in north and central Orange County. The retail agencies, in turn, 
supply water to homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the cost of the pump equipment will be borne by individual 
ratepayers through higher water bills, district officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Officials decided last February that the pumps and valves were needed to speed 
the collection of storm water runoff that the district captures at Anaheim Lake 
and stockpiles underground. 
</P>
<P>
Water district policy requires that competitive bids be sought for contracts 
worth more than $20,000 -- unless some kind of emergency exists. Even then, the 
district's 10-member board must approve. 
</P>
<P>
The board gave that approval June 21 by voting unanimously to purchase the 
equipment directly from Chemwest Inc., Southern California distributor of Flygt 
Corp. water pumps. The vote came after board members reviewed a staff report 
recommending the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
There is no state law requiring that public agencies such as the Orange County 
Water District seek competitive bids when awarding contracts, but "good public 
policy" dictates that they do, said Thomas A. Papageorge, a Los Angeles County 
assistant district attorney who is an antitrust law consultant for the Orange 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition benefits the consumer by lower prices and better quality," 
Papageorge said. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials now acknowledge that the report contained errors. But 
they say the mistakes were few, inadvertent and inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a damn good decision," said William R. Mills Jr., district general 
manager. "I'd do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Chemwest President Gerald E. Ehle, whose company has distributed Flygt products 
since 1985, praised the water district for its handling of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely convinced personally that they have gone out of their way to 
make sure things are handled on a very professional and constructive basis," 
Ehle said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehle also denied that his competitors could have delivered the equipment for 
less than his company did. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, there's no way that could happen," Ehle said. "I feel somebody 
may have used you to try and attack Flygt Corp." 
</P>
<P>
Several water district board members said that when they voted on the contract 
they were unaware of the report errors but have since assured themselves that 
the Chemwest award was proper. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff satisfied my concerns that everyone had been dealt with fairly," 
said board member Donn Hall, a former mayor and councilman in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Added board member Philip L. Anthony: "We really did look at it (after the 
competitors' complaints). I think the original justification (to make the 
purchase) was reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Lawrence P. Kraemer said that he also checked with staff 
members about the errors in the report and that they acknowledged "a couple of 
discrepancies." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we did the right thing," Kraemer said. "My conscience is clear." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Mills said the Chemwest contract qualified as an 
emergency purchase for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* A bidding process would have taken too long, Mills said. The pumps needed to 
be obtained by November so they could be installed in time for the winter 
rains. Because it can take as long as five months for large pumps to be 
manufactured and shipped, he said, there was no time to conduct a bidding 
procedure that sometimes takes up to two months. 
</P>
<P>
Several Chemwest competitors contend that they could have met the five-month 
manufacturing time and that the bidding process could have taken as little as 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* Mills also said the staff report concluded that no other company made 
submersible pumps as good as the Flygt models distributed by Chemwest. 
</P>
<P>
However, Patrick Couch, managing director of the Submersible Wastewater Pump 
Assn. in Chicago, said in a recent interview that as many as 10 Flygt 
competitors build pumps that are rated the same in performance and horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all doing the same kind of work," Couch said. "There's not a whole lot 
of differences." 
</P>
<P>
Mills acknowledges that the district may have paid more for the pumps and 
valves by not using competitive bids, but he adds that getting the equipment in 
place sooner will enable it to capture more runoff and eventually offset any 
price difference. 
</P>
<P>
"So what if we did pay a little more money," Mills said. "We have the 
opportunity to gain . . . in savings." 
</P>
<P>
The three-page staff report advocating Chemwest's contract advised that the 
board should consider only a Flygt pump because the Orange County Sanitation 
District -- based in the same office building as the water district 
headquarters -- had recently bought two Flygt pumps and intended to make them 
standard equipment throughout the sanitation district. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the sanitation district say, however, that they bought only one 
Flygt pump nearly two years ago, that it is not in service because it is 
incompatible with existing equipment and that they have no plans to buy any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
When that contradiction was pointed out to Mills in a recent interview, he 
turned to Assistant General Manager John M. Chaufty and asked him to explain. 
Chaufty, who wrote the report, responded: "I'm not exactly sure how that got 
into the agenda submittal (report)." 
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that Flygt pumps are supplied to "over 95%" of the 
world's large municipal submersible pump users. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it were like that," said Kent Friedl, U.S. sales manager for Flygt, 
which is headquartered in Sweden. "It's not even 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials said they got the 95% figure from Chemwest. However, 
Chemwest President Ehle said: "I don't know where the 95% figure came from." 
Ehle said the figure should be 86%, for the U.S. market only. 
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that comparable pumps could not be obtained from any 
other manufacturer serving the area and that Flygt pumps had a number of 
exclusive features. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of KSB Inc., Aurora-Hydromatic Pumps Co., ABS Pumps of 
Connecticut and Ebarra International Corp. of Japan say their companies make 
pumps that contain the same features. 
</P>
<P>
When one competitor complained about the district's selection of Flygt, Chaufty 
wrote a reply letter stating that the district's engineering consultant had 
also investigated products offered by two other companies -- M&amp;W Pump Corp. 
and Griffin (MAC Division) Pumps. However, neither company makes submersible 
pumps. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the district declined to open the contract to competing 
manufacturers, officials solicited price proposals from two Flygt distributors 
in addition to Chemwest. 
</P>
<P>
The other distributors declined to participate, however, because Chemwest has 
an exclusive contract with Flygt to sell products in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with Chemwest called for two district engineers to travel to 
Sweden to witness factory testing of the pumps. On Oct. 7, Kirby Brill, a 
district engineer, and Constanino M. Senon, a consulting engineer, accompanied 
Chemwest's president on the trip, and all of their expenses were paid by Flygt, 
according to Orange County Water District records. The wives of Senon and Ehle 
also went along but at their own expense, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was strictly a business trip," said Hans Norlander, a Flygt operations 
manager who helped organize the trip. 
</P>
<P>
A former Flygt district manager, however, said that Flygt often uses trips to 
the Swedish plant as a marketing technique. 
</P>
<P>
"They take them (clients) out to discos, they go to the finest restaurants," 
said Arlie Green, a former Flygt Midwestern district manager who is now a 
manager for the competing Aurora-Hydromatic Pumps in Aurora, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Senon and Brill declined to comment.

STREET SMART: PLAYING TAG? CHP TAKES EXPIRATION DATES SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'm amazed at the number of vehicles on the streets with expired tags, some 
dating back to last January. What is the law concerning expired tags? If it is 
illegal, why isn't the law enforced? 
</P>
<P>
Randy L. Jepsen 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal. And, as you say, there are a lot of people out there daring 
authorities to go ahead and make their day. Of the 24 million cars, trucks and 
vans in California, about 2 million are being operated without proper 
registration, according to officials with the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Local and state lawmakers say it's an important issue. The more than $4 billion 
in registration and license fees collected by the state each year are an 
important revenue source for a variety of programs: 14% goes to the California 
Highway Patrol, 10% to the state Transportation Department, 11% to the DMV and 
56% trickles down to cities and counties, which use the money for street work, 
maintenance and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV is the first to acknowledge the depths of the problem. A bit more than 
a year ago, the agency embarked on a far-reaching effort to more effectively 
identify scofflaws shirking the legal requirement to register their vehicles. 
Since October, 1988, the effort has helped collect $78.9 million in 
registration fees that might otherwise have been missed, according to Bill 
Gengler, a DMV spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible how many people out there are driving with expired tags," 
Gengler said, noting that the problem involves owners of cars ranging from 
junkers to Mercedeses. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said motorists refuse to register for a variety of reasons, but the 
most common are concerns that their cars won't pass the smog test requirements 
or a simple unwillingness to pay what they perceive as an exorbitant cost for 
the privilege of driving their own vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for failing to register can be steep. If you don't pay on time, the 
DMV charges an extra 20% of the original fee. If the car remains in use, the 
penalty rises to 40% and then 80% in subsequent years. To collect, the DMV has 
begun turning to small claims court. And the agency also has the ability to 
impound cars if an owner repeatedly flaunts the law. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol can also get into the act. While tracking down 
delinquent registrations is not the agency's most pressing responsibility, CHP 
officers are always on the lookout for vehicles with expired tags, said Officer 
Ken Daily of the south Orange County division. 
</P>
<P>
"The Highway Patrol doesn't receive any money from traffic tickets, but we do 
get funds because of vehicle registrations," Daily said. "So it's only 
understandable that officers don't ignore registration. Most of the officers 
zero right in on it." 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I cannot understand why California does not have a mechanical vehicle 
inspection law. There are automobiles on the freeway that would not pass even 
the most lenient mechanical inspection in any other state. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers in these unsafe vehicles are the cause of many accidents and 
traffic delays and they should not be allowed on our highways. I was always 
told that driving is a privilege and not a right. A person driving an unsafe 
vehicle should be charged a higher fine and receive more points for a speeding 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Szwajkos 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
Although driver performance is the most common cause of accidents, mechanical 
malfunctions add to the death and injury toll on our nation's highways each 
year. Many state officials would like an inspection program, but contend that 
California simply lacks the funds right now. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, the state did have such a program, which was financed 
with federal money. The California Highway Patrol would set up special units to 
flag down drivers along city streets and county roads. Each vehicle that passed 
the inspection would get a sticker that would go on the windshield. Those that 
didn't pass muster would have to remedy the problems and then have their cars 
reinspected at the local CHP office. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the CHP will still issue fix-it tickets, but mostly only for the 
obvious stuff, like a burned-out brake light. Most of the active enforcement is 
saved for trucks, which are subject to inspections during weigh-ins at the 
truck-scale stations that dot the highways. Authorities reason that there is 
nothing worse on the road than an 18-wheeler hurtling down a steep mountain 
pass with brakes that could barely stop a tricycle.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
</P>
<P>
TOP PRIORITY PUT ON KEEPING OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Open space preservation, a new civic center and financial concerns are the 
issues facing San Juan Capistrano in 1990, Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer says. 
</P>
<P>
If city officials have their way this year, a parcel of open farmland in the 
north end of town will be preserved by voters in a special election scheduled 
for April. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer targeted a proposed, $21-million general-obligation bond issue to be 
used toward the purchase of the 120 acres of open space for parkland as the 
single most important issue for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the last opportunities we have to preserve the signature of San 
Juan Capistrano," Hausdorfer said. "There aren't any other areas of open space 
like it in the city." 
</P>
<P>
To maintain the rural aspects of this 213-year-old community, which became a 
full-fledged city in 1961, the city decided to sponsor the bond issue as a way 
of keeping the land out of the hands of private developers. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers have said they would like to convert the acreage, covered with 
dying orange trees and bisected by two major creeks, into residential and 
commercial projects. Former farming families who have owned the land for 
generations are waiting for the election outcome before making a decision on 
selling, relatives have said. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues to watch in the coming year include a move forward on plans to 
build a new civic center in the middle of town, one block north of Mission San 
Juan Capistrano, Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the staff has outgrown the current facility on Paseo Adelanto and also 
complained that it is not centrally located. The aluminum building was 
originally intended as a temporary facility when it opened in the late 1960s, 
and has been expanded several times since then. 
</P>
<P>
The new city hall would be located next to the library, on a site now occupied 
by asphalt tennis and basketball courts. The recreation facilities would be 
relocated, Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Financial issues for next year include the council's recent decision to back 
away from building a joint sewage-treatment plant with the neighboring 
Capistrano Beach Sanitary District. 
</P>
<P>
Because a joint plant would cost $30 million, city officials have decided to 
pursue more sewage-treatment capacity at a Dana Point plant that now handles 
the city's wastes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the 1990s will see San Juan Capistrano manifest itself as a mature 
city," Hausdorfer said. "We would like to be a leader in regional issues for 
South Orange County." WENDY PAULSON

ATTRACTING BUSINESS TOPS CITY'S AGENDA

<P>
Encouraging redevelopment, balancing the budget and working to enhance air 
safety are the major concerns facing Buena Park in 1990, Mayor Donald L. Bone 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to finish the master plan for redevelopment," Bone said in a 
recent interview. "Although much of the plan was completed last year, there are 
still some i's to dot and t's to cross." 
</P>
<P>
Bone said one of the biggest challenges is completion of "Auto Row," a string 
of dealerships on Manchester Avenue at the Santa Ana Freeway. City officials 
also hope to attract more new businesses to the city's entertainment corridor 
along Beach Boulevard, which now includes Knott's Berry Farm and the Movieland 
Wax Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Bone said planning is under way for expanding redevelopment areas, possibly to 
include the Buena Park Mall. Planners are also analyzing the potential 
development of a 300,000-square-foot office building on Orangethorpe, next to 
the Sequoia Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
The city might revive a lapsed program offering low-interest loans to city 
business owners who want to expand or improve, Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
Air safety will continue to be a concern at Fullerton Municipal Airport, which 
borders Buena Park, Bone said. Several incidents in the past year, including a 
crash last fall in a Buena Park neighborhood, have led to clashes between 
political leaders of the two cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park leaders will try to "identify common concerns about the airport and 
the crashes that have occurred recently," Bone said. "This situation has caused 
relations to be somewhat tense. My goal is to relax that tenseness and find a 
common ground." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most immediate is the city's effort to eliminate a budget deficit, Bone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget for the current fiscal year, ending in June, is $35 million, with a 
projected deficit of more than $700,000. Salary increases for police and 
firefighters have increased that gap, Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the figures, you see one year," said Bone. "If you project 
out and look at two and three years downstream, that's where we begin to come 
into problems." 
</P>
<P>
This month, planning for next year's budget will begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Bone said he expects "a thorough review of our fiscal policies and how we spend 
our money." DEBORAH CARPENTIER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL OKS HIGHER PARKING PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parking illegally in Los Alamitos became more expensive this week when the City 
Council approved sharp increases in fines for the most common violations. 
</P>
<P>
Red-curb and 72-hour parking violations will increase from $19 to $32, and 
parking in a fire lane will now cost $54 instead of $29. 
</P>
<P>
Most other violations, including parking in front of a fire hydrant, parking 
too far from the curb, parking on a sidewalk or in a crosswalk, and parking 
within 15 feet of a public driveway, will now cost $32, up from $29. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James Guess said a random survey of six other Orange County cities 
showed that Los Alamitos had been charging from 10% to 105% less for these 
violations than the other cities. For instance, a fire lane violation in Los 
Alamitos cost $29, while in Anaheim, Buena Park and Tustin it is $56. 
</P>
<P>
The rates were last increased two years ago, Guess said. The rate increase 
approved by the council Monday goes into effect immediately.

Lifeguards rescued 863 people and prevented more than 70,000 potential 
incidents on the city's beach last year, according to a report by lifeguard 
chief Tim Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Superb weather brought large crowds to the beach, Dorsey wrote, resulting in a 
dramatic increase in lifesaving work. In 1988, the lifeguards rescued about 650 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rescues, lifeguards administered major first aid to nine 
people and minor first aid to about 800 people in 1989, the report said. No 
drownings were reported. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

IF NOT IN YOUR BACK YARD OR MINE, WHOSE?;

<P>
CHARITY: THE NIMBY SYNDROME PERVADING OUR CITIES SERVES NO ONE. HUMAN RIGHTS 
MUST SUPERSEDE PROPERTY RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN FORBATH, Jean Forbath is chair of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When President Bush spoke eloquently about "a thousand points of light," he 
credited private voluntary agencies with brightening our nation with their 
commitment and service. And rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
However, what he failed to mention, or perhaps is not aware of, is that today 
many of the brightest, most needed and most effective of those points of light 
often are not wanted in any community. The NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) syndrome 
is diminishing, if not destroying, the delivery of social services all over our 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every city in Orange County has experienced an outcry from neighbors 
when a social service agency has applied for the needed permit to open in their 
neighborhood. Just a few recent examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Fullerton has continued to deny the Orange County Department of Social 
Services permission to open a welfare office branch, citing incompatible use. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mental Health Assn. received a large grant from the state to open a 
drop-in center for the mentally ill homeless. They looked all over the county 
for more than a year to find a place that would accept them and found none. 
They finally were welcomed at the YMCA in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
* Outcry from Costa Mesa residents caused a man and his son who wanted to open 
a residential facility for recovering alcoholics to withdraw their request. 
</P>
<P>
* The Assistance League was prevented from enlarging its day-care center 
because of neighbors' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
* Orangetree neighbors in Irvine came out in force against a proposed shelter's 
opening near their tract, even saying they feared the homeless would come into 
their yards and use their barbecue pits. 
</P>
<P>
* Huntington Beach citizens stormed City Hall protesting the opening of a small 
drug counseling center. 
</P>
<P>
* La Habra residents objected to a low-income day-care center, saying they 
didn't want those children in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
* Costa Mesa severed a warm 20-year relationship with Share Our Selves and will 
be forcing it out of Rea Center because of neighbors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
* Episcopal Service Alliance received a bomb threat when it opened a small 
drop-in center for the homeless in a South County shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Ana is attempting to curtail feeding the homeless by proposing 
ordinances to make it almost impossible for private agencies to comply. 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized recent example of the NIMBY syndrome destroying a needed 
project was Nancy Reagan's withdrawal of her sponsorship of Phoenix House for 
youthful drug abusers when the neighbors just said no. More than $1 million had 
already been raised. 
</P>
<P>
NIMBY is a most formidable opponent because unless you live near an SOS or a 
Phoenix, those who do live there taunt you with, "Would you want it in your 
neighborhood?" Unless we can at least say, "I don't want it, but I will accept 
it," we really can't point fingers at anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
And the sad thing is that most agree that these programs are desperately needed 
and that the services are provided much more effectively by private agencies -- 
as long as they are not here, near me. We've got to ask ourselves, "If not 
here, where?" 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners say not in a residential area; business owners say not in a 
commercial or industrial area. Churches have been the most welcoming as a haven 
for social service programs, but their facilities usually are very limited and 
are already strained with their normal activities. So what is the solution'? 
First of all, we need a change of heart and a change of values. We need to be 
willing to try to know and understand others who are different from us so we 
won't fear them and see them as "undesirables." And human rights need to be on 
a par with property rights in our value system. 
</P>
<P>
We can dream of this utopia where everyone is welcome and there are no 
undesirables and agencies are given wholehearted support. And we can exhort 
with Elizabeth Ann Seton to "live more simply so that others may simply live." 
But reality creeps in, and we know, as imperfect as we are, this will probably 
rarely happen unless there is a forcing function. 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that what is needed is a state requirement that every 
city or local jurisdiction set aside areas with a special social service 
zoning, so that not only is there required space in every city, but de facto 
acceptance of these needed programs without a divisive public hearing and 
approval process. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to believe that we would all be willing to have these programs 
in our back yard, and with the right political leadership and moral climate, it 
could well happen. But until that time, we may need a state law requiring us to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
Social service agencies have been accused of being magnets drawing 
"undesirables" into neighborhoods. Eliminating the helping agencies will not 
make the poor, the homeless, the immigrant, the mentally ill, the alcoholic, 
the developmentally disabled and the brain-damaged disappear. It will only make 
them suffer more.

SECTION TO USE POWER-RATING FORMAT FOR PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Section administrators will use a power-rating formula this season to 
select at-large teams for the section's 10 divisions of boys' and girls' 
basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Each division will have a 32-team bracket; the top three teams from each league 
will receive automatic berths in their divisions, which are based on 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
At-large teams will be selected based on the following criteria: -- One point 
for scheduling any team above a school's division. For example, if a team such 
as Laguna Beach (2-A) plays in a league of 3-A and 4-A teams, Laguna Beach will 
receive a point for playing each game. The school also would receive points for 
scheduling nonleague games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for defeating any team in a higher division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for defeating a team in the same division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for defeating an eventual league champion or co-champion 
regardless of division. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One point for winning a nonleague tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
Those teams compiling the most points are eligible for at-large bids. If teams 
total the same points, then the selection will be based on head-to-head 
competition, performance against common opponents and a blind draw. 
</P>
<P>
The point system, designed and adopted by the Basketball Coaches' Advisory 
Committee, will be incorporated in the playoff handbook. Woodbridge High School 
Coach Bill Shannon, a member of the committee, began developing the system last 
year. He said the format rewards teams that play tougher nonleague schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows good teams to get into the playoffs and that's what it's all about," 
Shannon said. "There may be people upset with it who didn't schedule a tough 
level of opponents (this season). But that's probably someone who wasn't up on 
the rumor mill." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, teams needed only a .500 record to qualify for an at-large bid. As 
a result, many teams padded their nonleague schedule with opponents from 
smaller schools, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that being over .500 to be considered for at-large bid was a mistake," 
Shannon said. "People quit playing good teams in preseason. You could have a 
good fourth-place team that is 10-14 with wins and losses against high-caliber 
competition, and (it) still wouldn't get in (the playoffs)." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said the system probably wouldn't work for football, where pairings are 
set up on a geographic as well as record basis, but it could be expanded to 
other sports. Other states, such as Nebraska, use a similar system to determine 
at-large berths. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' playoff pairings will be announced on Feb. 11 and the girls' matchups 
on Feb. 12 at the Southern Section office in Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Add basketball playoffs: Division playoffs begin Feb. 13 for boys and Feb. 14 
for girls. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' Southern Section championships are scheduled for Feb. 28, March 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' Southern Section championships will be Feb. 28, March 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California regionals will be March 6, 8 and 10 and the state 
finals are scheduled for March 16-17 in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock by the numbers: Guard Tes Whitlock gave scorekeepers fits in Loara's 
93-91 Empire League loss to Los Alamitos Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, a 6-foot-2 junior, scored 54 points to tie the third-highest 
single-game total in county history. He was five points shy of breaking the 
county record of 58 set in 1910 by Art Worthy of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock opened with 19 points in the first quarter and added 11, 13 and 11, 
respectively, in the final three quarters. He scored 16 of the Saxons' first 20 
points and had 30 of their 44 points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock made 17 of 24 shots, including five of 10 three-pointers, and was 15 
of 21 from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"He's awful fun to watch," Loara Coach Jerry Halpin said. "It's almost scary 
because he's only a junior and he's playing like he's a man. When he gets on a 
roll, you want the ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great game to be at. It was a packed house and a league game. Tes 
thrives on that kind of environment. I didn't even realize he had 54 because he 
was in the flow of the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock entered the game as the county's second-leading scorer with a 30.2 
average. His previous best was 42 points against Western earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's scoring has made a difference for Loara. The Saxons, 9-33 in the 
past two seasons, are off to a 12-3 start this year. 
</P>
<P>
Add Loara: The Saxons were playing without starter Dan Wassink, who broke his 
left foot against Katella last week. Halpin said Wassink will be out eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Nieto, boys' soccer coach at Kennedy High School and a co-coach at 
Cerritos College, will take a high school team on a tour of the Soviet Union in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Nieto was one of 50 coaches picked from a field of 1,000 to participate in the 
Sports for Understanding, an international exchange program. U.S. teams in 
several sports will tour the Soviet Union and other countries for three weeks 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kyong Kim, a senior co-captain at Kennedy, will be one of 16 players on the 
U.S. team that will play 12 games against the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are excellent soccer players," said Nieto, who grew up in Colombia 
and played soccer at New York University. "They're among the favorites to win 
the World Cup. 
</P>

"But they often underestimate the level of U.S. soccer. We might go in and 
surprise them. It's not a sport like basketball, where the Soviets expect the 
United States to have a high level of play."

<P>
Run but not gun: After Capistrano Valley's Chris Kostoff and Scott McCorkle 
combined for 41 points in a 64-47 loss to Mater Dei Jan. 6, Cougars Coach Mark 
Thornton decided his team needed to balance its scoring. 
</P>
<P>
On the Monday after the Mater Dei game, Thornton didn't let McCorkle and 
Kostoff shoot during practice. 
</P>
<P>
"When two guys have 41 of your 47 points, something is definitely wrong," 
Thornton said. "We had to do something to get the other players involved in the 
offense. We made them shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton's plan worked -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Brett McCorkle, Scott's brother, led the team with 24 points and Tom Airey came 
off the bench to add 17 in an 85-79 triple overtime loss to Mission Viejo 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff scored 22 points, Scott McCorkle scored only six. 
</P>
<P>
Winning ways: Pacifica girls' basketball fans found something to cheer about 
last week as the Mariners ended a 46-game losing streak with a 43-39 victory 
over Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica had suffered through two consecutive winless seasons -- 0-16 in 1988 
and 0-20 in 1989 -- and were off to an 0-3 start this year. The Mariners had 
not won since 1987, when they beat Loara with seven games left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica's winning streak was short-lived, however. The Mariners (1-4) lost to 
Bolsa Grande, 31-26, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar finished fourth and Laguna Beach 13th in Volleyball Monthly's 
national girls' rankings. Corona del Mar's Danielle Everett, The Times' Orange 
County player of the year, was named to the magazine's All-American first team. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster's football team is scheduled play a game in Virginia on Aug. 31 
against Robert E. Lee High School, pending approval of the Southern Section's 
general council on Thursday. Westminster opened its 1987 season with a victory 
over Robert E. Lee and Coach Stan Clark said he is hopeful of returning to the 
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Sweet, El Dorado athletic director, is accepting applications for two 
assistant track coaches, a girls' varsity swim coach and several varsity 
assistant football coaches in a walk-on capacity. Anyone interested should 
contact Sweet at 993-5350. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County players and coaches were honored at the All-Southern Section 
water polo awards banquet last week at the Sequoia Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Howald of Corona del Mar was the 4-A player of the year and Jeff 
Ehrlich of Villa Park was the 4-A coach of the year. El Toro swept the 3-A 
honors with player of the year Ken Nickel and coach of the year Don Stoll.

Q&amp;A JAMES HARRELL AND PAUL ARMSTRONG: GOING TO MARKET IN EAST BLOC; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL CHANGES CAN MEAN PROFITS FOR WESTERN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Iron Curtain has crumbled over the past several months, local 
businessmen James Harrell and Paul Armstrong have been devouring all the news 
they can about the fast-paced changes sweeping the Soviet Union and the rest of 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, both Harrell and Armstrong have formed separate companies 
with the idea of tapping the potential created by the extraordinary political 
and economic changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The two fledgling companies have yet to strike up any major business deals in 
Eastern Europe. But both men believe they are getting in on the ground floor of 
a market that could offer significant potential during this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, 37, is one of three local founders of Intertrade, an international 
marketing and management firm in Laguna Niguel. The other founders are Kim 
Martello and Robert Ludovise. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Intertrade's primary activity has been in the area of commodities 
trading. The company organized a $2.1-million transaction that involved 
shipping manure from the Soviet Union to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Intertrade currently is involved in negotiating several joint venture deals in 
Poland, none of which has been completed. Among the projects in the works are 
deals to establish a small medical clinic at a Polish hospital in cooperation 
with the Polish government, and another that involves setting up a biomedical 
research center. The firm also hopes to complete a nonprofit venture to donate 
a large number of typewriters to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that there are plenty of opportunities for companies right in 
our own back yard (in Orange County) to deal with Eastern Europe," Harrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Huntington Beach, Harrell also runs a one-man consulting company 
specializing in cross-cultural management. Harrell is a former executive with 
World Vision who has set up relief projects in Cambodia for the Monrovia, 
Calif.-based international development agency. He formerly worked for the 
Defense Department as a Flemish interpreter in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 31, is a founder of RHA Group, a business services firm specializing 
in the Soviet Union. In October, RHA opened an office in Moscow headed by 
Andrei Lefebvre, a Moscow native who formerly headed a public relations and 
marketing company in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Before founding RHA in July, Armstrong helped organize a recent effort by 
Irvine-based American PC to sell personal computers to the Soviet Union. He 
left the company before the deal was announced in September by Phoenix Group 
International, an Irvine firm that owns a majority interest in American PC. 
</P>
<P>
RHA's first project in the Soviet Union involves organizing weeklong, 
industry-specific tours for Western business people. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Times staff writer David Olmos, Harrell and 
Armstrong discussed the topic of doing business in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe and offered some suggestions for companies interested in getting 
involved in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. After last year's events in Eastern Europe, many people are talking about 
doing business there these days. How do you view the opportunities for doing 
business over there? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: I think that we make the common mistake in this country when we 
lump lots of nations together. We do it when we refer to Asia. It's similar to 
referring to someone as Caucasian. Eastern Europe is a mix of lots of different 
economies. They have been under alliance economically as the Warsaw Pact. But 
that started dissolving eight to 10 years ago. In some nations, there is 
tremendous opportunity immediately. In other nations, the opportunity is there 
but the infrastructure for developing a trading base isn't in place. Ask 
yourself what it would be like if for most of your life you had not been 
allowed to trade freely -- to apply your energy to making a profit for 
yourself, your company or your family -- and then suddenly the restrictions 
were removed and you could trade freely. That's the potential for Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We hear a lot about how difficult it is for Western business people to do 
business in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from an everyday standpoint. 
How difficult is it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: In the Soviet Union, there is a lack of structure and a lack of 
business knowledge of things we take for granted, such as letters of credit, 
the cost of money, interest rates and ownership. These simple matters can turn 
into difficult and complex problems. But this is all part of what we consider a 
long-term approach. We're hoping the people we deal with in those countries 
learn these business concepts and the structures we need in order to do 
business successfully. I was in the Soviet Union for a week in December. Just 
getting out of the hotel and finding a taxi was a nightmare. It took a 
half-hour to flag down a taxi. Getting a document faxed or photocopied can turn 
into a two-hour ordeal. And once you find a copier or fax, there's the question 
of whether the machine works. If you want to make a phone call to the United 
States from Moscow, you usually have to order the call a day in advance. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: There are very limited lines of access. In Poland, for example, of 
149 phone lines into the country, there are only 37 outgoing lines. This is 
because of decades of conditioning where people have not been encouraged to be 
productive. It was not in your best interest to be productive or 
entrepreneurial because your actions might be suspect. This is a mentality that 
has to change. With our company, we find we are providing primarily financial 
and managerial expertise. In Poland they have some of the most skilled 
professionals in Eastern Europe because they trained in the West. But they got 
back to Poland and did hard labor work because you made more money. There was 
no motivation to be a doctor or other professional. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Don't these everyday problems related to doing business in Eastern Europe -- 
for example, the poor phone service or shortage of business equipment -- also 
create opportunities for American companies? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: There is a tremendous shortage of hotel rooms in the Soviet Union 
and all over Eastern Europe. Intertrade was recently negotiating with an agency 
that was given sole rights for the city of Moscow to develop a 500- to 700-acre 
site for a hotel and business center. At this point, there is no real place for 
international business people to come and have conferences and learn about 
markets and prepare for doing business. We are having similar negotiations for 
a hotel and conference center in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the potential for supplying consumer products to the Soviet Union 
or Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: There is lots of potential, but the question is, what are the 
high-priority items? Is a television or a VCR a high-priority item compared to 
feeding people? Nevertheless, every now and then there is a huge order from 
these countries for consumer items such as razor blades or stockings or things 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: Look at what the East Germans were buying in the West after the 
Berlin Wall came down. They were buying fresh fruit like bananas and oranges. 
The Western mind often confuses luxury items versus necessity items. Our life 
style is such that having a TV is virtually a necessity to us. Obviously, to 
people of a different life style, that's the last thing they'd consider. 
Necessity items are those things that will either feed them today or feed them 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There are a lot of computer, biomedical and biotechnology companies in 
Orange County. Based on your experiences in Eastern Europe, do you see these as 
areas of opportunity for local companies? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: I think there is great potential in Orange County in those areas. 
But here are two main issues companies must face. One is that the technology 
must be appropriate to the country. Some of our technology might be more 
advanced than what the lesser-developed countries of Eastern Europe actually 
need. The second issue is that most high-tech goods will have to be paid for in 
hard currency. Very few computer companies are willing to trade computers for 
steer manure. That's where companies such as Intertrade can step in, by 
bartering commodities that allow these countries to obtain the hard currency. 
Also, Orange County firms will have to make sure their products are 
competitively priced on the world market, because the Japanese and others will 
be trying to sell there too. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If you were going to give some specific tips to business people for doing 
business in Eastern Europe, what would you tell them? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: More than just selling a specific product, Orange County 
entrepreneurs will make a foothold in Moscow or Warsaw or Prague if they're 
able to go in knowing the culture, being sensitive to the business practices 
and being flexible in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: When you go into these markets, you cannot expect to come out 
with a deal. A company must go in and anticipate that it will take a year or 18 
months to get a contract, big or small. You have to cultivate business and 
personal relationships. You need to get to the point where these people are 
comfortable with you and don't think you're going to leave them high and dry. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So the factor of trust between the negotiating parties is more important in 
these countries? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: Culturally, countries such as the Soviet Union or the cultures of 
Asia and Latin America base their relationships on trust. A written contract is 
icing on the cake. Putting something in writing means much less than having a 
trust relationship develop. From our Western linear perspective, our culture 
wants to have something in writing to verify an agreement. If you're going to 
do business in Moscow or Warsaw, the tendency will be that the negotiation will 
be ongoing. What you get on paper might look to a Western investor as something 
that is non-negotiable. It will look very rudimentary and very unsophisticated. 
But it's what's behind the piece of paper in the negotiations that's important. 
If you just keep that frame of mind, you can be successful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Any other tips you have to offer? What about the importance of having a 
representative in the country where you're doing business? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: You have to follow up on your business deals. It's important to 
have your own office or a representative over there who can knock on doors. You 
need to have someone who is oriented toward Western concepts of business, that 
time is money. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: It's absolutely essential to have some point of contact. It isn't 
like going shopping at the local mall. You really have to know through your 
contact the atmosphere, the awareness within the business environment and the 
necessary officials. The conditions are changing so rapidly within the last 
five or six months. Not only is it changing in each country, but it's also 
changing regionally because of global attitudes that have changed during the 
past few months. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about the facilities that exist? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: I think there is something analogous in Eastern Europe to what 
happened after World War II in Western Europe. Basically, an infrastructure 
doesn't exist. Everything that now is available will be new. They will have new 
modern technology in the new facilities that will house joint ventures or 
manufacturing plants because they don't really have existing buildings to be 
used. They don't have car dealerships; they need cars. They don't have things 
that we take for granted. Anything now going into Eastern Europe now is 
relatively new. So as their structures are put into place, they will be far 
superior to most of those in the rest of Europe. What you're looking at are 
societies and economies that have been without structure from the standpoint of 
privatization. They have not been private. So, the slate is clean and it's time 
now to help build structures in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there differences between opportunities in Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: In Poland and Hungary, they've had this economic evolution of 
being closer to the West for 10 or 20 years. In the Soviet Union, which has 
been so isolated, one of the problems we have now is that they don't have a 
clue. It's going to take five to 10 years just to shift the bureaucracy. We all 
know how difficult it is to change these huge bureaucracies and how they have 
their own inertia. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: I think the Soviet Union in that way is a very different picture 
from most of the smaller nations in Eastern Europe. The structure that does 
exist is so big that getting that to change will not be as easy -- nor will it 
happen so quickly -- as it has in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Q. No one really predicted that the political and economic changes in Eastern 
Europe would happen so quickly. Using last year's crackdown on the 
pro-democracy movement in China as an example of how a situation can quickly 
reverse directions, is there some concern that a similar thing could occur in 
Eastern Europe? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: People feel a strong tie toward Western Europe and toward the 
West in general. They see what the West has done economically, and many people 
want something similar. They see themselves as nations that have stagnated 
economically for 40 years and now there is time to be like everyone else. In 
China, you don't have the telecommunications, you don't have the Western 
European television, you don't have the influx of Western Europeans into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: It's a historical and cultural issue. There is absolutely no 
similarity between what happened in China and what happened in Eastern Europe. 
I believe that what has happened to date will not stop, depending on the nation 
involved. There are large numbers of ex-patriots who have been waiting for 
these days. At our company, we have a lot of people coming to us who are from 
Romania, Hungary or Poland asking how they can help. There's much more than 
just business and wanting to make a profit. There's a loyalty and allegiance to 
give something back to their country. The approximately 9 million Poles who 
live outside their country go back regularly. Their families still live there, 
their money goes there, they go back to visit regularly. 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: You have these colonies of immigrants outside of the East Bloc 
that have established business communities that will help establish ties with 
these countries. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: I think one of the biggest potential limitations for U.S. and 
Southern California business involves the right attitude to have for doing 
business in Eastern Europe. The business and the trade are there. The 
relationships that are there must be for the long term, not just the short 
term. And there is no deal to get. The real thing you're doing is developing a 
trust relationship for years to come. For the most part, there is not a 
negative attitude of American business versus Japanese business or any other 
kind. There are negative attitudes toward a lack of trust. We feel Southern 
California could really go to the forefront in terms of foreign investment in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: In Eastern Europe, business is very difficult and I don't think 
any company can do it all by itself. I think a team approach is essential for 
success. It's self-defeating to think you can go in and do it all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I would imagine that you would probably favor some U.S. government moves to 
ease trade restrictions for Eastern European countries? 
</P>
<P>
A. Armstrong: We really hope the U.S. government sees fit to give 
most-favored-nation status to all the East Bloc countries and the Soviet Union. 
I believe that would help stabilize the economic situation there. It would 
allow us to import basic consumer items such as clothing or basic machinery. 
Now we're faced with bringing these products in with 50% or 90% tariffs. It 
just blows us out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harrell: On the export side, I think the trade rules between the United 
States and Eastern Europe. It will change when American businesses petition and 
say we should have the right to sell in the Soviet Union.

MINORITIES CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF 2 PAPERS

<P>
A boycott of Boston's two major newspapers was called by a group of minorities 
to protest "racist attitudes" in the investigation of the slaying of a city 
furrier's pregnant wife. The Boston Boycott Committee, which calls itself a 
grass-roots group of blacks and other minorities, urged a boycott of the Boston 
Globe and the Boston Herald from today to Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The group expressed outrage over initial media reports that a black Boston man 
had been considered as the prime suspect in the slaying of Carol Stuart in the 
city's Mission Hill section. Investigators now believe Charles Stuart shot his 
wife before wounding himself to conceal his involvement in the crime. 
Meanwhile, new published reports cited more than 50 people who said that the 
police made a practice of searching young blacks and Latinos in sweeps of the 
working-class sections of the Mattapan, Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods 
even before the Stuart shootings.

A female Army intelligence analyst who is an expert on Panama filed a complaint 
over being excluded from taking part in the U.S. invasion there, but she said 
that her problem stems from "confused" policy rather than sexism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it was not deliberate," Sgt. Rhonda Maskus, who is a member of 
the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, N.C., said in an interview on CBS-TV's 
"Face the Nation." She has filed the complaint with the Army's Office of 
Inspector General. Maskus, a Spanish linguist, said she played a key role in 
the contingency planning for Panama. About 600 of the 24,500 U.S. military 
personnel who took part in the invasion were women.

Oleg Derkovsky, a political counselor on Near and Middle East affairs at the 
Soviet Embassy in Washington, called his invitation to visit Temple Emanu-el on 
the Russian Orthodox New Year's Day "a symbol of new times, of changes for the 
better." The temple has the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. 
Derkovsky told his audience that the Soviet Union has "a strong desire" to 
renew relations with Israel but was "discussing how best to do this from a 
practical point of view."

Two new witnesses say the wife of Gallo Winery co-owner Julio Gallo did not 
cross a highway center line before a fatal traffic accident, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. The CHP previously said two other witnesses claimed 
Aileen Gallo drove across the center line, causing the Jan. 2 crash on Pacheco 
Pass that killed the other driver, Sharon Kauk, 27, of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing the Gallos told CHP investigators the new witnesses 
reported having seen the wreck, a CHP spokesman said. He said the new witnesses 
are a 17-year-old Salinas youth and a 23-year-old man from Modesto, the city 50 
miles northeast of the accident scene that is headquarters for Gallo, the 
world's largest winery. The CHP spokesman said the two reported that Kauk's car 
drifted into the path of the eastbound Lincoln Town Car driven by Aileen Gallo 
along California 152.

SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW VISION; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE CITY BY THE BAY IS SHEDDING ITS ISOLATIONIST AND ANTI-BUSINESS 
ATTITUDES, AND JOINING ITS NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION TO CONFRONT GROWTH ISSUES. 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stung into awareness in the 1980s that it was no longer the undisputed 
financial grande dame of the West, San Francisco heads into the '90s with much 
of its gentility intact but with more of a team player mentality. 
</P>
<P>
Long regarded as a haughty isolationist, San Francisco is suddenly asking not 
what its region can do for it, but what it can do for the Bay Area, which has 
boomed even as the city's job and population growth have stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's newspapers recently devoted plenty of ink to the new Bay Vision 
2020 Commission, an unprecedented public-private partnership with a one-year 
mandate to halt the region's bickering and to chart a mutual course for 
resolving crises in housing, transportation, land use, and air and water 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a switch from the past, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and other Bay 
Area leaders traveled together last May to Asia to court Pacific Rim business, 
and they plan further joint marketing efforts. By contrast, his predecessor, 
Dianne Feinstein, was noted for her frequent solo travels to Asian nations to 
pitch the merits of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Many San Franciscans say it's about time. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco (has been) a terrible neighbor to the rest of the area, very 
self-righteous," said Michael S. McGill, executive director of the Bay Area 
Economic Forum, another new group seeking to broaden San Francisco's 
perspective. "People realize that there's a need for a regional approach." 
</P>
<P>
"That absolutely is the key to San Francisco's future," Agnos agreed. "There's 
no way that our balkanized approach to doing business is going to succeed in 
the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, many San Francisco watchers acknowledge, this politically 
fragmented, often fractious city seems uncertain about what exactly its role 
should be -- advocate or adversary of growth within its own boundaries, 
competitor or compatriot of Silicon Valley and the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a city in search of its future," said Joseph A. Wahed, senior vice 
president and chief economist of Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, San Franciscans have tended to become mired in narrow, 
neighborhood issues, taking a regional-economy-be-damned approach. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the transition is bound to be rocky as San Francisco faces up to a 
multitude of challenges: corporate job loss, costly housing, middle-class 
exodus, clogged highways, strained public transit, pollution, competition from 
Los Angeles and other West Coast cities and an image tarnished by the October 
earthquake, the homeless, the AIDS crisis and a lingering reputation for being 
anti-business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the litany, no one forecasts a Detroit-like economic breakdown for this 
affluent city, especially in light of the grit and determination it 
demonstrated in the aftermath of the Oct. 17 quake and its exemplary handling 
of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the growth of small businesses and specialized service jobs, 
observers point out, the San Francisco economy remains vibrant. This is despite 
the loss of as many as 50,000 corporate positions during the past decade 
because of corporate parings, mergers and relocations. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the city's unemployment rate was an enviable 3.2%, below the 
statewide figure of 4.9% and 0.4% below the October figure. (A city research 
analyst noted that much of the reduction was accounted for by a change in the 
computation method.) 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco is increasingly a center for "high value-added services" such as 
law, accounting and consulting. It still provides most of the financial and 
government services for the Bay Area. Although tourism dropped off markedly 
after the quake, a full recovery is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also, the mayor said, putting renewed emphasis on clothing 
manufacturing, film and TV production and the fishing industry, which are 
expected to generate more jobs in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
And it remains a mecca for free thinkers and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco will undoubtedly lead the way in innovating many of the 
businesses of tomorrow . . . with a lot of money behind them," said Alan D. 
Mutter, a partner in a San Francisco-based media investment firm and former 
city editor of the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"But the future of San Francisco proper depends more and more on what happens 
outside San Francisco. The future of San Francisco is Walnut Creek, Concord, 
San Jose, Santa Rosa." 
</P>
<P>
Such an idea might have seemed preposterous 20 years ago, when San Francisco 
seemed to hold all the marbles. 
</P>
<P>
Until the late 1960s, the city was relatively self-contained and fully 
diversified, with a strong manufacturing base, dozens of headquarters offices 
and a healthy tourist and retail trade. With its favorable climate and 
attractive surroundings, San Francisco drew a gamut of businesses, from 
financial institutions to wholesalers to lumber, food and transportation 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America's 52-story headquarters, completed in 1969, started a swift 
"Manhattanization," with skyscrapers dwarfing what had been a quaint skyline 
punctuated by hilltop landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Driven by corporations' voracious appetites for space, San Francisco developers 
for a time were putting up a whopping 1.6 million square feet of offices a 
year. Vacancies hovered at just above zero, and rents for prime offices 
skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
The boom brought an influx of workers and cars -- and a backlash among 
residents concerned about congestion and declining quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from slow-growth advocates, the city in 1984 adopted a Downtown 
Plan that sought to impose some limits on building, but frequent exemptions 
granted to developers outraged opponents. Two years later, voters passed a 
ballot proposition calling for permanent limits. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, businesses nationwide were facing other far-reaching phenomena: 
deregulation, which forced cost-cutting moves, and the wave of mergers and 
hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers were laid off at such established San Francisco companies 
as Crocker National Corp., which was swallowed up by Wells Fargo; Crown 
Zellerbach, bought by corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith, and Southern 
Pacific Co., which merged with Chicago's Santa Fe Railway. Bank of America and 
Bechtel, big city-based employers, fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some major employers -- notably Chevron, Pacific Telephone and Bank 
of America -- chose to keep their headquarters in San Francisco, perhaps for 
the prestige, but moved large numbers of back-office and technical workers to 
office parks springing up in the East Bay, where land was plentiful and rents 
were cheap. 
</P>
<P>
(After soaring for a time to more than 20%, the current downtown vacancy rate 
is 15.3%, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial, compared to 13.4% in Los 
Angeles and nearly 20% for cities nationwide.) 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was ill prepared for the sudden economic transition. Workers 
moved into ever more distant suburbs and began commuting in a haphazard manner 
that even the region's highly touted but piecemeal transit system could not 
begin to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class migration left San Francisco with a polarized collection of 
affluent white-collar professionals and poorly paid service workers. 
</P>
<P>
As the East Bay, Silicon Valley to the south and Marin County to the north 
flourished, San Francisco became the "hole in the doughnut of the economy," 
according to Walter E. Hoadley, former chief economist at B of A and now a 
senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, opportunities have been lost in the last decade or two to pull 
together," Hoadley said, decrying the lack of cohesive leadership in the 
nine-county, 98-city region. "The future depends upon avoiding conflicts and 
capitalizing on the economic dynamism that runs across boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
The region at large has accounted for job and population growth of late, even 
as San Francisco proper has stagnated. According to the Palo Alto-based Center 
for Continuing Study of the California Economy, the number of jobs in San 
Francisco has remained flat since 1985, totaling 567,300 in 1988. During the 
same period, the region has added half a million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Population in the city has grown by only 50,000 to 731,000, whereas in the 
region it has spurted to 5.8 million from 5.1 million. Last year, San Jose, a 
fruit-canning town turned high-tech center, surpassed San Francisco to become 
the nation's 12th-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the region is expected to add 700,000 jobs and 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
With the growth in outlying areas, executives say, a major regional issue is 
land use planning. Housing, not job location, now dictates where people live. 
Many workers migrate to outposts such as Vacaville, 50 miles northeast of the 
city, or Modesto, 80 miles east, and commute an hour or more to offices in 
Livermore. That, in turn, strains highways and defies a quick fix with public 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
Hoadley foresees that "we will build solid between here and Sacramento in the 
next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
This sprawl, disparagingly dubbed "Los Angelization," prompts a comparison to 
clogged Southern California that San Franciscans find distasteful. Yet the 
trend continues. 
</P>
<P>
B of A, for one, recently announced plans to build a $125-million office 
complex on a 100-acre alfalfa field in Vacaville for as many as 2,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 
acknowledges that San Francisco businesses "probably have not done a good job" 
of putting the jobs where people live. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, one challenge of the '90s will be "preserving the quality 
of the environment while managing and dealing with the congestion." 
</P>
<P>
In compact San Francisco (at 46 square miles, the city is about the size of 
Long Beach), homes are among the nation's most expensive, and affordable 
housing strikes many as an oxymoron. But environmentalists and community 
activists keep trying to force the construction of housing, even if it comes at 
the expense of business development. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco assumes that we'll export our housing needs to the suburbs," 
said Sue Hestor, an attorney and an influential advocate for rehabilitating 
buildings in Chinatown and other sections to provide affordable housing. She 
contends that the city has been "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that any significant development in San Francisco faces a long, 
costly approval process. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., for example, claims finally -- after nearly 10 
years of planning -- to be on the verge of an agreement with the city for 
development of a former rail yard into a $1.5-billion office, residential and 
light manufacturing complex called Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The 315-acre development, south of Market Street, must pass muster first with 
city officials and then with voters, possibly in November. 
</P>
<P>
The project has required "sensitive and delicate negotiations," Agnos said, on 
such issues as the amount of moderately priced housing and the disposal of any 
toxics that might be uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Many such efforts have been stymied or delayed by a lack of cooperation between 
business and government, said James K. Ho, deputy mayor for business and 
economic development. "The public and private sectors have not worked well 
together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, neighborhood and slow-growth groups have resisted a Newport Beach 
developer's plans to turn an up-and-coming section of the bayfront into a yacht 
harbor and hotel, which would be the first on the waterfront. Meanwhile, port 
officials are eager for the commercial development because they need the income 
that it generates to continue improving maritime facilities, which, along with 
Oakland's, have seen a dramatic loss of market share to other West Coast ports. 
</P>
<P>
San Franciscans have repeatedly "divided up into little camps" over growth 
issues, to the detriment of the city's economic well-being, said Kent O. Sims, 
president of the San Francisco Economic Development Corp., a business-funded 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Sims created some shock waves around City Hall with a provocative "white 
paper," published the morning of the earthquake, that cited single-issue 
politics and a lack of widely embraced leadership as major constraints on 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But Ho said progress in building business for San Francisco and the Bay Area is 
being made. After the visit of Agnos and other Bay Area leaders to Asia, a 
prominent group of Pacific Rim nation executives decided to hold a major trade 
and finance symposium in San Francisco this September. Previous gatherings 
sponsored by the group were held in Sydney and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, Ho added, is increasingly realizing that it needs to bury its 
rivalries with other Bay Area communities and promote cooperation, particularly 
when it comes to marketing the region as to the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"Why compete with each other?" he said. "If San Jose gains, we gain. If we get 
hurt, everybody gets hurt. The (Bay) Bridge came down, we got hurt, too." 
</P>
<P>
Agnos noted that emphasis will be on making presentations that sell the Bay 
Area, not just San Francisco, as a market for Asian goods and as a source for 
products and services.

Disney Announces Florida Plans: A fourth theme park, a Soviet pavilion and 
seven new hotels will be among major projects to be built in the '90s at 
Florida's Disney World, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner announced. The 
conglomerate will also venture into time-share vacation units, and open 29 new 
attractions at its three existing Florida parks: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot 
Center and Disney-MGM Studios. A commercial shopping mall is planned on 
property that Disney owns in Osceola County, Eisner said.

MARKET BEAT: PORTFOLIO MANAGER ZEROES IN ON REAL ESTATE-RELATED STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERB GREENBERG, HERB GREENBERG is a financial columnist for the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about those real estate jitters that have rocked the market lately. 
Portfolio manager Allen A. Parker is undaunted. "Wealth accumulation has always 
involved substantial real estate," he says. Only now it will be through real 
estate-related stocks more than direct investment. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who runs the U.S. Real Estate Fund, operated by San Antonio-based 
United Services Advisors, argues that the "wave of the future" is the 
securitization of real estate (an unpopular subject these days). That's because 
the end of most tax breaks on real estate investments and the illiquid nature 
of such ventures have made them unattractive to many institutional and wealthy 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he's particularly high on real estate investment trusts. About 160 
are listed on stock exchanges, but only half are actively traded, and he 
considers only 25 to be of institutional quality. Of those, he sticks to a 
subgroup that he calls "property specific," which he believes are most 
recession-resistant, especially those that either own local strip shopping 
centers anchored by grocery or discount drug chains, or properties leased to 
psychiatric or substance abuse hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
What makes REITs especially attractive, he says, is that they "pay you to wait" 
with robust dividends. For example, Boston-based Copley Properties, "an example 
of being in the right thing in the wrong place," owns industrial and office 
properties in its headquarters city. It trades for about $11.50 on the American 
Stock Exchange, but has a dividend yield (dividend as a percent of share price) 
of more than 8%. "So you're going to wait for this thing to come back," he 
says.

Parker also likes Bethesda, Md.-based Federal Realty Investment Trust, which 
owns shopping centers in the mid-Atlantic region; Wellesley, Ma.-based 
Meditrust; Los Angeles-based Health Care Property Investors; Beverly 
Hills-based American Health Properties, and Toledo-based Health Care REIT. 
</P>
<P>
P.S.: Another Parker pick is home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad, whose stock has 
plunged about 25% in the past six months. "We'll buy on the pullback," he says. 
That's because he believes that real estate investing is a little like 
investing in mutual funds: It should be done for the long haul, just "more so 
with real estate."

<P>
Thrifty Investing in Closed-End Funds 
</P>
<P>
Like those closed-end country funds that are the rage these days, several 
similar funds are devoted exclusively to savings and loans. (Shares of 
closed-end funds, unlike conventional mutual funds, are traded on exchanges.) 
The idea is that you can get thrift stocks cheaper by buying shares in the 
closed-end fund rather than buying the individual thrift stocks, while 
eliminating the risk of trying to pick a winner. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite of Prudential-Bache Securities closed-end fund analyst Steven 
Cress is First Financial Fund, which trades as a stock on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and closed Friday at $7.375 a share. "The stocks in the fund are 
oversold, and eventually the market will place a fair valuation on it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Cress isn't alone with that opinion: Savvy New York hedge fund manager Julian 
Robertson hasn't sold a share even though First Financial's price has dropped 
by nearly half since he nearly doubled his position last August to 27.5%. 
Robertson, who is quick to admit a mistake and then sell off, told me: "This is 
one we don't think is a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a Corporate Co-Pilot 
</P>
<P>
Informed sources say: Pan Am, which is known to be seeking a merger partner, is 
in discussions with NWA (and not just Trans World Airlines, as has been widely 
speculated). If a deal is struck, it is likely to be structured (on paper at 
least) with Pan Am buying NWA (which owns Northwest Airlines), which itself 
recently went private . . . New York real estate developer Donald J. Trump has 
quietly sold all of his stock in AMR, the parent of American Airlines, which 
has slumped about 30 points since he bought it and launched a short-lived bid.

MEDIA: A STANFORD MBA TRIED TO MAKE A POINT WITH A NAIL IN HIS FIRST SALES 
LETTER, BUT GOT FEW SUBSCRIBERS. HIS HIGH-TECH ISSUES HAVE HAD A BROADER

Six years ago, Christopher Mead, a Stanford MBA, combined his interest in Japan 
and Asia and his love of writing to start several newsletters. The time was 
right: The newsletter business was booming, and investment and competition from 
Asia, particularly Japan, was on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Phoenix entrepreneur produces five specialized newsletters on topics 
ranging from Japanese investment in U.S. real estate to high technology. The 
five newsletters include Japan High-Tech Review, Korea High-Tech Review, Korea 
Automotive Review, Southeast Asia High-Tech Review and Japanese Investment in 
U.S. Real Estate Review. 
</P>
<P>
His monthly publications are circulated in the United States and abroad. 
Although Mead declines to give his circulation figures, he says the high-tech 
reviews, for example, are sent to subscribers in Moscow, China and even Aruba. 
Heads of some of the Fortune 500 companies were among his first subscribers for 
the Japan High-Tech Review, which was started in January 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mead, whose brother is political economist and author Walter Mead, is owner, 
president, publisher and editor of Mead Ventures. His interest in Japan goes 
back to his graduate school days at Stanford Business School. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to help the Japanese graduate students become part of campus 
life, Mead helped organize an association for Japanese and American business 
students in 1978. The group provided a forum for American and Japanese students 
to mingle professionally and socially. It has since merged into the Asia Forum 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Mead spent the summer in the middle of his two-year Stanford MBA program in 
Japan, where he taught English. "I was so frustrated; their English was not as 
good as I expected." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the United States, completed his MBA and went to work for 
Charles von Loewenfeldt Inc., a San Francisco consulting firm that did public 
relations work for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, the Consul General in 
San Francisco and the Japan External Trade Organization in San Francisco. He 
wrote speeches for the Japanese Consul General in San Francisco and accompanied 
U.S. teachers to Japan under a program sponsored by the Keidanren (Japan 
Federation of Economic Organizations.) 
</P>
<P>
His first newsletter focused on Japanese high technology because "I didn't 
think Americans knew what was going on in Japan." To attract attention to his 
newsletter, Mead sent a four-page sales letter with a nail punched through it. 
</P>
<P>
"This nail is made of Japanese steel," read the teaser. "It is a low-tech 
information barrier. There are also barriers to high-tech information." Mead 
got all kinds of comment on the letter, but virtually no subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a little soul searching, decided to throw together a first issue and I 
sent that out to members of American Electronics Assn., and it was an immediate 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
But not all his mail is favorable. Mead used to keep a file marked "Abuse" 
filled with solicitation cards scrawled with derogatory responses, such as, 
"You're selling away our country" or, "I won't participate; get a job." 
</P>
<P>
Not all his newsletters have been successful. He recently discontinued Emerging 
Automotive Industries Review, which focused on car exports from Third World 
countries. "It was a flawed concept from the beginning," Mead explained. "Third 
World autos in general went into slump in terms of exports to the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Private Mead Ventures Inc., which began in 1984, employs a staff of five in 
Phoenix and a network of stringers. Mead also writes a bimonthly column on 
Asian high technology that appears in the San Jose Mercury News and about dozen 
other publications, including the Bangkok Post and Dataquest (no relationship 
to market research firm by the same name) magazine in India.

Wacoal, the Japanese group that is the world's largest lingerie producer, plans 
to open a production plant in France. 
</P>
<P>
The company is investing in a production plant on a 23,000-square-yard site at 
Ernee in France. The plant, which is scheduled to come on stream in the spring 
of next year, will be the company's first venture in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Wacoal, based in Kyoto, has dominated the Japanese lingerie market for decades. 
A few years ago it moved into North America. 
</P>
<P>
Wacoal's arrival in the European market has important implications for 
established lingerie producers. At present the market is dominated by Triumph 
of Switzerland, together with Playtex and Warnaco of the United States.

LOST BOY DIES AFTER NIGHT IN ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG and JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old Hesperia boy who wandered away from a church group during an 
outing in the San Gabriel Mountains in the Angeles Forest died Sunday, just 
hours after rescuers found him partially frozen under a blanket of snow on a 
narrow ridge where he had spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
After an all-night search in dense fog, snow and strong winds, a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department rescue team found Ruben Allred at 10:25 a.m. after 
spotting a tuft of his blond hair sticking out of a "little mound of snow" 
about a mile from where he was last seen, Sheriff's Sgt. Gordon Carn said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was face down, arms pulled tightly to his sides, hands clutching his 
light cotton jacket close to his chest. He was clad only in the jacket, jeans 
and tennis shoes, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the snow built up around the boy," Carn said, "he probably tried 
to tuck himself in at about 12 (midnight) to 2 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
The youngster had not been seen since about 3:30 p.m. Saturday in a play area 
near Ski Sunrise, a resort about five miles from Wrightwood. But his absence 
went unnoticed until 6:30 p.m., when his mother -- who had been at the church 
preparing for an evening dinner and dance -- discovered that her son had not 
returned with the rest of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-grader's disappearance prompted an intense search-and-rescue effort 
that involved as many as 90 law enforcement officers and volunteers from Los 
Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers fanned out over a 30-square-mile area to look for Ruben. They finally 
found him on a ridge along Table Mountain, where a foot of snow had fallen 
Saturday night during the season's worst storm. 
</P>
<P>
The child was taken by helicopter to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in 
Lancaster, where doctors said he showed no signs of breathing, had no pulse, no 
heartbeat and a body temperature that had fallen below 60 degrees -- too cold 
for them to determine if he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, he was transferred by helicopter to UCLA Medical Center in 
Westwood, where died at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Ruben's death came on the heels of another tragedy in his 
family -- his father died two months ago of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
A student at Hesperia Junior High School, Ruben had gone to the mountains 
Saturday afternoon with about 200 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in the small town of Phelan, near San Bernardino. The church 
members broke up into smaller groups of five or six children, each group with 
an adult supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Carn said that about 3:30 p.m. Ruben told his supervisor he was too cold to 
continue playing and wanted to walk back to the car, parked about 100 yards 
from the play site. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably started in the right direction and something happened, he got 
sidetracked or who knows, and he just started walking in the wrong direction," 
Carn said. 
</P>
<P>
When the supervisor did not find Ruben at the car, he mistakenly assumed the 
boy had gone home in another carload of church members. 
</P>
<P>
When the cars started returning to the church, Carol Allred began wondering 
where her son was, said Randy Wilkerson, a church official. 
</P>
<P>
When they could not locate the boy at the church, congregation members notified 
authorities and drove back to the mountains to begin looking for him. Some 
joined in the search-and-rescue effort, Carn said. 
</P>
<P>
But foul weather hampered the search. 
</P>
<P>
"Between 2 and 5 a.m. we had strong winds, snow and dense fog, and visibility 
was extremely limited," Carn said. "We're talking maybe three or four feet 
visibility. . . . The weather was a real big factor." 
</P>
<P>
A volunteer search-and-rescue team from the Malibu sheriff's station finally 
discovered Ruben. Carn said the boy was so deeply covered in snow that it is 
possible rescuers passed by him during the night but did not spot him. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation and felt a slight pulse, 
Carn said. They radioed a helicopter that, carefully avoiding the surrounding 
trees, landed on the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter's pilot, Deputy Robert Flores, said he flew the boy to a nearby 
Caltrans maintenance yard, where he was transferred to a paramedic helicopter 
and taken to the hospital in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Auerbach, director of emergency services at the hospital, said the 
youngster was diagnosed as having hypothermia -- a considerable drop in body 
temperature. He compared the boy's condition to that of people who are 
submerged in icy waters for a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors attempted to warm his body by placing warm fluids in his abdomen, but 
Auerbach said the boy "did not improve substantially" during the emergency 
treatment and that his only hope for survival was to be hooked up to a 
heart-lung machine that could warm his blood and recirculate it through his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the proper equipment to treat the boy, doctors decided to transfer 
Ruben to UCLA. There, doctors continued resuscitation efforts and considered 
connecting him to the heart-lung machine, but the youngster succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
Hypothermia produces many of the signs of death: icy skin, stiff limbs and an 
undetectable heartbeat. Although the condition results solely from exposure to 
extreme cold, degrees and forms of hypothermia vary. 
</P>
<P>
"The average body temperature is 98.6 (degrees Fahrenheit). Anything below 95 
degrees is definitely hypothermic," said Dr. David Wagner, a senior resident in 
the emergency ward of County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The most dangerous form of the condition results when hypothermia develops 
slowly, said Dr. Steve Campbell, a UCLA Medical Center physician who supervised 
the treatment of Ruben. In such an instance, he said, ice crystals often form 
in the cells.

LAURENCE PETER DIES; THEORIZED ON INCOMPETENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laurence J. Peter, the psychologist and professor of education whose 1969 book 
"The Peter Principle" unmasked incompetents with searing satire and contributed 
a phrase to the language, has died of complications from a stroke, his wife 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter, 70, had also suffered from heart trouble before he died in his sleep 
Friday at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, said his wife, Irene. He had 
suffered a stroke two years ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the publication of "The Peter Principle," its author became an 
international celebrity with a runaway best-seller for the principle he 
expounded: "In a hierarchy, individuals tend to rise to their level of 
incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
This means, he wrote, that if you can do your job to your superior's 
satisfaction, you will be promoted. If you function appropriately in your new 
position, you are eligible for promotion again. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, you will be promoted to a job you cannot do -- and there 
you will remain, "bungling the job and eroding the competence of society." 
</P>
<P>
In time, Peter noted, every post tends to be occupied by someone too 
incompetent to carry out its duties. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, the only people who accomplish any useful work are those who have 
not yet been promoted to their level of incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
The Peter Principle took its place alongside Murphy's Law -- "Whatever can go 
wrong will go wrong" -- and Parkinson's Law -- "Work expands to fill the time 
available for its completion" -- as penetrating aphorisms for the technological 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Peter had written the book with free-lance writer Raymond Hull several years 
before its publication, but 13 publishers rejected the manuscript -- proving 
the book's central point. 
</P>
<P>
The book had grown out of his hobby of writing satire as a respite from his 
complex and difficult research on training teachers. After enduring the barrage 
of rejection slips from publishers, Peter submitted an article to The Times, 
applying the principle to California. 
</P>
<P>
His examples -- Ronald Reagan took the oath of office three days before Gov. 
Pat Brown's term expired, Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty was out of town when 
Watts exploded in urban revolt -- left publishers "almost lining up at my 
door," Peter once said. "So I just dusted off the manuscript and handed it to 
the one I decided was the best." 
</P>
<P>
The book sold more than 8 million copies, earning its author enough to retire 
in 1970 to devote all of his time to exploring ways to improve teaching. 
</P>
<P>
He also found time, however, to write several more "Peter" books, among them 
"The Peter Prescription," "The Peter Plan," "Peter's Quotations," "Peter's 
People and Their Marvelous Ideas," "Why Things Go Wrong" and "The Peter 
Pyramid." 
</P>
<P>
Peter was born in Vancouver, Canada, on Sept. 16, 1919 and grew up amid 
poverty. His father, a railroad worker, died in a drowning accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a primitive style of life," Peter once recalled. "In order to survive 
we had to make everything functional, getting maximum use of our limited 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Our home was just a shack. We cut wood out of the bush to give us fuel. We 
grew most of our food in the garden. It was unthinkable to waste anything." 
</P>
<P>
He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Western Washington State College 
and a doctorate in education from Washington State University. 
</P>
<P>
Peter taught in Vancouver's public schools and later as a psychologist at the 
University of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
He had long been preoccupied with the study of teacher competence -- he called 
it his life's work -- and he set out to initiate some reforms in the way 
teachers were prepared at the University of British Columbia in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of sequential, cumulative step-learning continued to amaze me," he 
told The Times in a 1975 interview. "Student teachers were told to observe 
children, given time to observe children -- but never, ever shown how to 
observe children." 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 he moved to Los Angeles where he had accepted a job as professor of 
education at USC -- a post that enabled him to continue the project begun in 
British Columbia. The result was the four-volume study "Competencies for 
Teaching: System of Accountability for Teacher Education." 
</P>
<P>
Peter said tests and studies with his system "can improve teacher performance 
and student learning by, in some cases, several hundred percent." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his wife, Peter is survived by two sons, John and Edward Peter of 
British Columbia, and two daughters, Alice Boren of Falls Church, Va., and 
Margaret Denney of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no services. Contributions may be made to the Laurence J. Peter 
Scholarship fund at the Washington State University Foundation in Pullman, 
Wash.

PRAVDA DETAILS EXPLOITS OF SOVIET WHO SPIED FOR U.S.

"He might have been the fellow next to you on the subway or in the line for the 
cinema, as ordinary a Russian as you might find in the Soviet capital, but 
'Donald' was a spy for the United States -- and had been so for nearly 30 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In a tale of both superpower intrigue and human anguish, the Communist Party 
newspaper Pravda on Sunday recounted the exploits, the motives and the capture 
and trial of a senior Soviet diplomat now sentenced to death on charges of 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
In his long run as a U.S. agent, Donald -- the pseudonym given him by his 
American contacts -- caused the Soviet Union enormous damage, according to 
Pravda. He disclosed much political and economic information, military secrets, 
including plans for chemical and bacteriological warfare, top Soviet diplomatic 
codes, preparations for civil defense and criteria for the use of nuclear 
weapons, it said. 
</P>
<P>
As portrayed by Pravda, Donald was perhaps more highly placed and better 
informed than any other agent that the United States has had for years in the 
Soviet government. His role was "most significant," the paper stressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Having access to many state secrets, Donald sold everything of interest to the 
U.S. intelligence service," Pravda said, summarizing his career as an American 
agent over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
But Pravda, in a virtually unprecedented effort to understand why a Russian 
would betray his motherland, probed more deeply into Donald's psychology, 
refusing to accept him as someone who had simply sold out his country for money 
or even for ideology. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we explain all this?" Pravda asked at the start of its lengthy 
article, devoted as much to analysis of the case as to condemnation of the 
traitor. "What are the sources of his betrayal? 
</P>
<P>
"To explain it all in terms of his being not fully appreciated at his workplace 
would be naive, although there are such opinions. . . . The situation is not 
primitive at all. The roots are somewhere very deep. And maybe our 'tree' is 
such because it is supported by such roots." 
</P>
<P>
Donald appears, from Pravda's description of him, to be a well-educated, highly 
trained diplomat or foreign affairs specialist, or possibly a military attache 
or, even more intriguingly, from the KGB, the Soviet intelligence and security 
service. Pravda did not disclose his real name, report when he was arrested or 
convicted or say whether he had already been executed. 
</P>
<P>
He had been recruited by agents of the FBI in 1961 while serving in the Soviet 
Union's mission to the United Nations in New York, according to Pravda. Then he 
was handed over to the CIA, for whom he spied in India and Burma and, most 
importantly, in Moscow itself, where he had high-level access in the government 
bureaucracy and through a research institute where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
"One can track political and ideological chance against a background of painful 
ambition," Pravda commented. "Somewhere he was misunderstood, and here they are 
-- ambition and love of himself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No FBI Comment 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a spokesman for the FBI refused to comment on the Pravda story. 
CIA spokesman Bill Devine told the Associated Press that, as a matter of 
policy, his agency would neither confirm nor deny the Soviet report. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda appears to be cautionary for the most part in publishing the story, but 
there is the unusual -- perhaps unprecedented -- suggestion that there may be 
something wrong in the Soviet system that produces such men as Donald and 
allows them to function for years without detection, apparently as dedicated 
officials and patriots. 
</P>
<P>
But the paper also praised KGB Col. Alexander S. Dukhanin, a controversial 
investigator who was criticized recently by a legislative commission for 
clearing a regional Communist Party official of corruption charges that might 
have implicated Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the party's ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
His pursuit of Donald, Dukhanin told Pravda, was like the proverbial "search 
for a needle in a haystack," and Dukhanin's critics saw the article as an 
effort to enhance his reputation and perhaps in doing so protect Ligachev from 
the vague, never specified charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting the KGB investigators, Pravda suggests that Donald's weakness was his 
own arrogance and the thrill he derived from such a dangerous undertaking as 
spying for the United States through much of the Cold War, including the period 
of fierce counterespionage campaigns that followed the successful Western 
penetration of the Soviet military's command staff in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live on the razor's edge and could not imagine another life for 
myself," one of his interrogators quotes Donald as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Described by Pravda as "a very self-assured man" who did "not believe in his 
possible failure," Donald believed that every move he made was too well thought 
out, examined and then re-examined for him to be caught. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it in my spine that the KGB was stepping on my heels," he told the 
investigator, "but an analysis of my activity erased all my worries." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, KGB investigators caught up with him, Pravda reported, through 
mistakes he made, apparently out of sheer fatigue after nearly 30 years as a 
spy, in encoding some of his reports for transmission to the American Embassy 
in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet counterintelligence officers had closed in on Donald several times 
before and even interrogated him, but all along he had "skillfully ruined the 
mosaic" of evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Pravda, Donald's career in espionage was one of remarkable 
exploits in the heart of the Soviet capital -- he sent radio transmissions to 
the American Embassy from passing trolley buses and left information in secret 
hiding places, including subway stations, public baths, cafes and hotels, 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
When he was abroad, his U.S. controllers would contact him through personal 
advertisements placed in the New York Times, the KGB investigators told Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pravda, one such advertisement calling on him to make contact and 
provide promised information said: "Moody -- Donald F., please write to us as 
you promised. Uncle Charles and sister Clara are okay. They want you to write 
to them. Do not forget about Dave, Doug and their wives. Are you going to 
travel soon? When? To where? Hope our family will get together again soon. Best 
wishes from brothers Eduard H. and John F. Closter, N.J." 
</P>
<P>
Each line, each word in that enigmatic ad in the personal column had a special 
meaning, Pravda said, but the essence was to remind Donald about plans to 
communicate with U.S. intelligence wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
When Donald was transferred to Burma, the U.S. agents placed an ad saying, 
"Moody -- Donald F. I was pleased to learn how lucky you are. See you soon. 
Everything is fine. John F." 
</P>
<P>
John F., one of the FBI agents who recruited Donald in New York, arrived in 
Rangoon, the Burmese capital, a little later and then handed him over to CIA 
agents who worked with him there, in India and later in Moscow, according to 
Pravda.

<P>
Rioting mobs killed at least 25 people Sunday in the Armenian quarter of Baku, 
the capital of the southern Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, bringing warnings 
from leaders in neighboring Armenia that the volatile region is close to civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs of hooligans have been committing atrocities," the official Soviet news 
agency Tass reported from Baku, describing the attacks as "pogroms" aimed at 
the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan. "Preliminary information puts the number 
of dead at 25." 
</P>
<P>
Lenin Street, one of Baku's main avenues, was described as drenched with blood. 
Russians living in the Azerbaijani capital spoke with horror of seeing Armenian 
neighbors shot at point-blank range, hurled from balconies, burned alive and 
even dismembered by the rampaging mobs of Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen murders here of the cruelest sort," a veteran Soviet journalist 
said by telephone from Baku. "Men, women and children, the young and the old 
alike, were attacked and often killed because they were Armenians. That alone 
-- to be Armenian in Azerbaijan -- was a virtual sentence of death." 
</P>
<P>
Radio Moscow said late Sunday evening that the unconfirmed death toll stood at 
more than 30 in Baku -- all of them believed to be Armenians or the spouses of 
Armenians. Several soldiers in the internal security force were also reported 
killed in the weekend fighting. 
</P>
<P>
As the attacks spread to outlying areas of Azerbaijan on Sunday afternoon, with 
official reports of dozens of further casualties, the central government in 
Moscow flew a division of riot troops into the republic to restore order, and a 
senior military commander called for the imposition of a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
But the official Soviet news media, reporting from Baku and elsewhere in the 
region, described scenes so reminiscent of the start of the Lebanese civil war 
15 years ago that 20 divisions of the Red Army might be required to end the 
growing conflict. Tass acknowledged in one report that police had no hope of 
restoring order themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian leaders, speaking at a rally Sunday of an estimated 300,000 people in 
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, angrily urged the formation of an Armenian army 
to avenge the deaths of their kinsmen in Baku, dismissing the central 
government's efforts to restore order as ineffectual and too late to halt 
escalation of the strife. 
</P>
<P>
Ashot Manucharyan, a member of Armenia's nationalist Karabakh Committee, called 
for Armenians to volunteer for new "self-defense units" and to bring their guns 
to the committee's offices to arm the special force. Preparations were also 
made to airlift squads of Armenian police and medical personnel to Baku and 
Nagorno-Karabakh to help Armenian residents there. 
</P>
<P>
"If our government will not carry out its duties, we must organize to defend 
ourselves," Manucharyan told the people at the Yerevan rally, thousands of whom 
wanted to march immediately to Baku. "Our hopes must rest only on ourselves. We 
must trust no one but ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Baku were the bloodiest in nearly two years of feuding between 
the Azerbaijanis, most of whom are Shiite Muslims, and the Armenians, who are 
predominantly Christian. Thirty-two people, most of them Armenians, were killed 
during three days of rioting in the Azerbaijani oil center of Sumgait in 
February, 1988; at least 150 more have died in fighting there since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kremlin Aides Sent In 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin on Sunday dispatched top officials at the head of special Communist 
Party delegations to resolve the crisis. Yevgeny M. Primakov, one of President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest advisers, went to Baku, while Nikolai Slyunkov, 
a member of the ruling Politburo, went to Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
And what began as a territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh -- an Armenian 
enclave within Azerbaijan, which remains besieged, under virtual martial law 
and the focus of great tension -- has grown into a conflict that threatens the 
central government's ability to maintain order and to rule the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We march, we fight and, if necessary, we die," another Karabakh Committee 
speaker said at the Yerevan rally. "But, if we die, we will take not one, not 
10 but 100 or more Azeris with each one of us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the Armenian nation to make its stand. We call upon our 
brothers in the diaspora to come home, and quickly, for this is it -- we 
survive or we die as a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Azerbaijani guerrillas, reinforced by even more men from other 
districts, were reported by Soviet authorities on Sunday evening to be 
attacking Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabakh, with dozens of people killed 
or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation there as "extremely tense," Tass said that the 
skirmishes had continued for three days and had spread to adjacent districts 
with dozens of people killed, wounded and missing. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijanis had kidnaped the entire government and Communist Party leadership 
of one Armenian district, according to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, and 
Armenians had then taken Azerbaijani hostages in reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
Internal security troops, supported by military helicopters carrying 
paratroopers, were fired upon Sunday but succeeded in landing in a virtual 
combat assault in an attempt to stop the Azerbaijani assault on Armenian 
villages, according to Tass. 
</P>
<P>
At least two Interior Ministry soldiers, one an officer, were killed over the 
weekend and five were wounded in separate attacks, apparently by Azerbaijani 
guerrillas, on the military barracks in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to Tass. 
Four other Interior Ministry soldiers were reported to be missing after their 
patrol was attacked while responding to an Azerbaijani attack on an Armenian 
village. 
</P>
<P>
But clashes that were once confined to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous district 
of 180,000 people far from urban centers, spread over the weekend to many other 
districts of Azerbaijan where small Armenian communities remained. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the predominantly Armenian district of Shaumyan, close to 
Nagorno-Karabakh, sent a telegram to Gorbachev warning that open warfare is 
close. "The possibility of the outbreak of civil war is quite real," the 
telegram said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative newspaper Soviet Russia on Sunday described the region around 
Nagorno-Karabakh as a virtual "war zone," and Red Star, the armed forces 
newspaper, reported in detail the escalation in fighting between the Armenians 
and Azerbaijanis to the point where each side now has its own helicopters as 
well as fully equipped light infantry. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku, armed groups of Azerbaijanis were patrolling the streets, searching 
for Armenians, according to journalists from the Soviet central press. Squads, 
using lists of Armenians residents from local government officials, were going 
door to door in search of those who had escaped the first assault. 
</P>
<P>
One Armenian woman in Baku told friends in Moscow by telephone that she was 
warned early last week to leave before she got "an olive" -- slang for a 
bullet. 
</P>
<P>
She could only buy a ticket for today -- and then only by using a friend's 
identity documents. Her fate is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The current fighting apparently began in Baku on Saturday when two 
Azerbaijanis, members of the Azerbaijani Popular Front, told an Armenian family 
to leave the city, according to accounts on Radio Moscow and in Izvestia, the 
government newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenians resisted, and they had an ax for a weapon. The Azerbaijanis were 
badly hurt in the ensuing struggle -- one died and the other remains 
hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the Armenian resistance and the Azerbaijani casualties enraged a 
rally of more than 150,000 people who gathered in Baku, a city of 1.7 million. 
At the Azerbaijan Front's urging, speakers proposed the creation of a "council 
for national security to protect Azerbaijanis." 
</P>
<P>
They also demanded the resignation of the republic's government unless it takes 
drastic measures to reassert its authority over Nagorno-Karabakh, and others 
recounted the recent Azerbaijani "success" in breaking across the 
Soviet-Iranian border by tearing down the fences and forcing Moscow and Tehran 
to agree to all-but-free movement across their frontier for Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
But there were calls as well, according to correspondents for the central 
Soviet news media, for the forcible expulsion of the remaining Armenians from 
Baku, a remnant of no more than 20,000 after two years of anti-Armenian 
violence there, and from the rest of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
"Calls were made at the rally to drive Armenians out of the city," the Radio 
Moscow correspondent reported from Baku in one of the frankest dispatches heard 
on Soviet radio. "Among the crowd, anti-Armenian slogans were shouted, and then 
the most terrible thing of all began -- the pogroms." 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijanis, whose leaders appeared to have lists, set out in pursuit of 
Armenians still living in the city, the correspondent said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not possible to avert many sad and tragic cases," he continued. "But in 
dozens of others, the militia (police) managed to save people." 
</P>
<P>
In others, he added, Azerbaijanis sheltered their Armenian neighbors, 
preventing an even greater slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Operational bulletins constantly contain reports about hostages being taken, 
both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, about exchanges of gunfire, about tragic 
events," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
"This republic is on the boil. Hearts are bleeding, and the police are trying 
to do everything they can." 
</P>
<P>
Although reinforcements are arriving, "What guarantee is there that the 
frightful thing that took place last night will not be repeated?" 
</P>

BARSTOW'S FOSSIL-RICH DESERT A GOLD MINE FOR STUDENTS AND SCIENTISTS

BARSTOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Footprints of huge bear dogs -- long-limbed grizzly-like beasts with 11-foot 
strides -- as well as three-toed horses and other ancient animals are found on 
the outskirts of this desert town 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The area is covered with other footprints and fossils of camels, pygmy running 
rhinos, saber-toothed cats and elephant-like animals bigger than cows but 
smaller than bison. 
</P>
<P>
Here on the bone-dry Mojave Desert lies the world's heaviest concentration of 
fossils of birds, beasts and insects that lived between 13 million and 16 
million years ago in a long-gone forest along a network of lakes, rivers and 
streams. 
</P>
<P>
This area is so important to paleontologists -- scientists who study the 
skeletal remains and footprints of organisms of past geological ages -- that 
all life forms in North America from that period are designated to be of the 
Barstovian Age. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many people outside Southern California know Barstow, but paleontologists 
everywhere are familiar with the town's name," said Bob Reynolds, 43, a 
paleontologist with the San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
"The scientific term Barstovian . . . identifies a whole array of mammals, 
birds, rodents and insects. Descriptions of Barstovian life are found in all 
paleontology textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972 the National Park Service set aside the fossil beds 8 miles north of 
Barstow to protect the scientific resources of the rugged badlands. They called 
it Rainbow Basin National Natural Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
It is administered, patrolled and protected by the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management and listed as a BLM area of critical environmental concern. "No 
Access" signs dot the area; not even the scientists are allowed to bring their 
vehicles into the fragile zone. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, erosion bares fossilized bones and footprints on the surface 
of the 8,300-acre Rainbow Basin. But for the most part, they are uncovered in 
digs conducted by scientific parties dispatched by universities and museums 
from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered fossils of at least 17 species of animals at Rainbow 
Basin that have never been discovered anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnivores ate vertebrae and ribs. What we find for the most part are teeth, 
jaws and limb bones. We have no complete skeletons," Reynolds explained. 
</P>
<P>
Major collections from Rainbow Basin are housed in the Los Angeles County 
Museum, the San Bernardino County Museum, UCLA, UC Berkeley and the American 
Museum of Natural History of New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Reynolds noted that before the area was set aside by the National Park 
Service it was known locally as the Barstow Fossil Beds. "For years people from 
the Barstow area would collect bones of the ancient animals that surfaced from 
erosion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is said one of the best collections of the Barstovian Age could probably be 
found in closets, garages and dresser drawers in Barstow homes where many 
answers to the age-old puzzle of ancient life might well be found." 
</P>
<P>
Although collecting the ancient material is now prohibited except by bona fide 
scientists with permits, amateur collectors still are occasionally caught. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, a paleontologist from the University of New Mexico 
observed an amateur collector digging up a camel fossil. It was discovered the 
man had been collecting for years. 
</P>
<P>
He was found guilty, fined $250 and ordered to turn over his fossil collection 
to the San Bernardino County Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, however, don't want to keep the area just to themselves. Tim 
Read, 41, of the BLM's Barstow office inaugurated a program last year to 
introduce every fifth-grader in town to Rainbow Basin. 
</P>
<P>
John Murray, 45, an archeologist for BLM Barstow Resources Area, showed a 
tilted and folded formation with two dozen ancient camel tracks still intact. 
"I tell the kids that camels in those days ran upside down," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
In a more serious vein he pointed out holes in the formation where camel prints 
had been cut away. "The footprints are really mud frozen in time and place. 
When someone removes the ancient tracks they crumble. Everyone loses," Murray 
said.

31 INJURED AS BUS FLIPS NEAR VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Greyhound bus carrying passengers from Los Angeles flipped on its side and 
skidded 50 feet on a rain-slick highway near Las Vegas on Sunday, injuring 31 
people, none seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver, who was not immediately identified by authorities, was changing 
lanes on Interstate 15, slightly north of the Spring Mountain Road exit, when 
he lost control, Nevada Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident did not appear to be caused by excessive speed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus slammed into a center divider and flipped onto its side, coming to rest 
on top of the guardrail in the middle of the six-lane highway, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers "got banged around pretty good," Marquardt said. The injuries 
appeared to be minor to moderate -- bruises but no broken bones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers left the bus by walking or climbing over the front 
dashboard where the windshield had popped out, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty passengers and the driver were taken to four area hospitals, Marquardt 
said. All but one had been released by late Sunday.

AGOURA HILLS TEEN IS ARRESTED AS SUSPECT IN DEATH OF OLDER BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura Hills teen-ager who disappeared at the same time his older brother 
was found shot to death in the family home on New Year's Eve has been arrested 
in the murder, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Minkoff, 18, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at a friend's 
home in North Hollywood late Saturday, three days after Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies obtained a warrant charging him with the murder of his 
brother, Michael Minkoff, 20, Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager will be arraigned Tuesday in Malibu Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Michael Minkoff, an engineering major at Moorpark College, was 
found at about 11:30 a.m. Dec. 31 on the kitchen floor in the family's home in 
the 28900 block of Dargan Street after deputies responded to a 911 call, 
apparently made by the victim. Investigators found no sign of forced entry at 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the two brothers had been seen together at the home the day 
before the shooting, but the younger brother had disappeared and the parents, 
Barbara and David Minkoff, were vacationing in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, sheriff's homicide investigators said they only wanted to question 
Bradley Minkoff and had not ruled out the possibility that he also was the 
victim of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting, Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Gaynor said, "There's always 
been sibling rivalry" between the brothers. "I don't know there was enough to 
kill." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10, sheriff's investigators named Bradley Minkoff in an arrest warrant 
obtained in Malibu Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies later told Los Angeles police they believed the suspect was staying 
with friends in the 5300 block of Vantage Avenue, Police Sgt. Phil Butler said. 
Using an unmarked car, undercover officers watched the home and arrested 
Minkoff when he returned to the location at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday, Butler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was turned over to deputies at the West Hollywood sheriff's 
station, where he was booked on suspicion of murder. He was later transferred 
to Los Angeles County Central Jail, where he was held without bail Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said no other arrests were made at the North Hollywood home. They 
declined to discuss any motive in the shooting or explain why Minkoff had been 
named as a suspect in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The murder and arrest of the younger brother stunned residents on the Minkoffs' 
neatly landscaped street, where neighbors gather each Fourth of July for a 
festive block party and where criminal activity is rare. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very eerie to come down the block and see their house now," one neighbor 
of the Minkoffs, who asked not to be identified, said Sunday. "Here we are in

SMITH, REINER -- UNDERDOG KEEPS PLUGGING AWAY

The candidate for attorney general badly needs exposure in Southern California, 
so the other day he held a press conference right in front of his opponent's 
Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
But as the reporters gathered around and the lone TV camera switched on, 
everything went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked . . ." shouted Arlo Smith over the traffic on Temple Street. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, no words would come out. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, excuse me," he said finally after a mighty clearing of his throat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked Ira Reiner, district attorney of San Francisco. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Whoops, wrong county. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner is the district attorney of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, in fact, is the district attorney of San Francisco County. And as he 
tries to get the Democratic nomination for attorney general, reality has set 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does Reiner avoid gaffes when the TV cameras are rolling, he has an 
enormous advantage in the attorney general's race because of years of media 
exposure in Southern California, where most of the state's votes are. 
</P>
<P>
A California Poll last October found that Reiner was known by 55% of all 
registered Democrats; Smith was known by only 17%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smith keeps hammering away, and he can point to some pluses. 
</P>
<P>
Both the National Organization for Women and the main police union in the 
state, the Police Officers' Research Assn., have endorsed him. It is the kind 
of left-right support Smith got when he came from nowhere to beat the incumbent 
district attorney 11 years ago in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
These days Smith spends most of his weekends meeting with Democratic activists 
and potential contributors in Southern California. And to show how serious he 
is, Smith, who has personal family wealth, recently put $500,000 of his own 
money into the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a solid record as San Francisco district attorney, he can argue 
that he would make a good attorney general because he was a deputy in that 
office for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
But he knows he is going to have to shout to get attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Reiner should stand up and take responsibility for his actions," Smith 
yelled the other day across from Reiner's office on Temple Street. 
</P>
<P>
Three buses roared by and nearly drowned him out. 
</P>
<P>
Smith blasted away at Reiner for the recent revelations that some jailhouse 
informants used by Reiner's staff concocted or twisted the information they 
gave to the prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner maintains that the concern of some of his aides about using the 
informants never reached him, and he has moved to institute safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
But on the day Smith showed up on Reiner's turf, Reiner was far to the north, 
testifying about pending legislation in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's campaign manager, Sam Singer, ridiculed the notion that Smith actually 
wanted a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on. It has been public knowledge for weeks that Ira would be in 
Sacramento testifying," said Singer. "Arlo Smith does not really want to go 
face to face with the Silver Eagle." 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Eagle? 
</P>
<P>
"My name for Ira," explained Singer, "because of his silver hair and steady 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Singer has no nickname for Arlo Smith, a bald man with a mild manner. But the 
way Reiner is totally ignoring him, it could be The Gnat. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would we pay attention to Arlo Smith when his only major supporter is Arlo 
Smith?" said Singer, referring to Smith's $500,000 contribution to his own 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A former San Francisco political consultant familiar with Smith's career 
warned, however, that Reiner may find it impossible to ignore him before the 
voters finally have their say in the June 5 Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Behind Arlo's milquetoast exterior is one of the toughest, meanest people you 
will ever meet," said the consultant, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a 3% in the polls when he started running for San Francisco D.A. and he 
wound up with 76% of the vote. The way he did it was to stay on the attack." 
</P>
<P>
In that race, Smith beat an incumbent district attorney who had angered gays 
and police during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
But this time there is no indication so far that Democratic voters are 
displeased with Reiner in the attorney general's race. 
</P>
<P>
He led Smith by 36% to 23% in the California Poll taken in October. Smith had 
gained 10 points since a previous survey, but Reiner had not dropped any. 
</P>
<P>
But the number of undecided voters in the attorney general's race was 40% in 
that poll, and that is what keeps Smith going. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating but I just have to keep plugging away," he said before 
heading off to another stop in Southern California.

U.S. AND 3 LATIN NATIONS OK MILITARY ROLE IN DRUG WAR

The United States and the cocaine producing countries of Bolivia, Colombia and 
Peru tentatively agreed Sunday to include military units from each country in a 
stepped-up war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
However, South American delegates said the agreement leaves out any language 
that might open the door to direct U.S. intervention in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
The text of the plan will be kept secret until President Bush and at least two 
of the South American presidents sign it at a drug summit Feb. 15 in Colombia, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached early Sunday after a five-day preparatory meeting, 
represents "an integral commitment by the four countries, which have proposed 
carrying out a frontal and unstoppable assault on narcotics trafficking," said 
Bolivian Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralde Ballivian. 
</P>
<P>
He said the accord recognizes the need for more U.S. economic aid to the South 
American countries, which in turn committed themselves to a full-fledged 
military campaign against the multibillion-dollar cocaine industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, we perhaps haven't wanted to accept the reality of narcotics 
trafficking," Iturralde said. "We limited ourself to police action." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the South American countries are committed to using "all 
the means they have available," including the armed forces, in the war on 
trafficking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His speech, which covered the agreement in general terms, concluded the meeting 
at 4:30 a.m. Sunday, one day later than planned.

MOSCOW ASKS WEST'S HELP ON BALTICS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE KREMLIN WANTS U.S., OTHER NATIONS TO DISCOURAGE THE REGION 
FROM SECEDING. A BREAK COULD LEAD TO A 'CATASTROPHE,' A PARTY OFFICIAL SAID.

<P>
The Soviet Union, faced with growing demands for independence in its three 
Baltic republics, is asking the United States and other Western countries to 
discourage their secession as a threat to European stability and broader 
East-West relations, according to senior Soviet officials and Western 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet argument, which emphasizes the need for a political evolution after 
the dramatic upheavals in Eastern Europe, has won considerable sympathy within 
the Bush Administration and in West European capitals, these sources said, but 
has drawn criticism from conservatives pleased to see the possible breakup of 
the "Soviet empire." 
</P>
<P>
"The secession of the Baltic republics, particularly if encouraged by the West, 
would probably throw our relations back at least to what they were after 
Afghanistan and the Korean airliner incident," a senior Communist Party 
official said here, "and at worst they lead to a general world catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
In referring to the sharp deterioration in East-West relations after Moscow's 
1979 military intervention in Afghanistan and the shooting down of a South 
Korean airliner in 1983, the official recalled the two incidents in the past 
decade that not only heightened international tensions but increased the risk 
of military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The current fear, according to well-placed Soviet sources, is that secession by 
the Baltic republics would encourage nationalists in other Soviet republics to 
seek independence and thus bring the dismemberment of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Gorbachev would not survive this, nor would perestroika," a senior 
Soviet diplomat said, also asking not to be quoted by name. "Beyond this basic 
political fact, the separation of the Baltic republics, for example, would 
involve the security of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The West, particularly the United States, should not cheer the Baltic 
republics on, and we have told everyone this. We have told them: 'Let us do 
things in our own way, in our own time. Developments so far have not been 
unfavorable to the West. Let events evolve by themselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
These warnings, which have been delivered across Europe and to the United 
States and Japan, underline the seriousness of the challenge that President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev faces in the growing nationalist ferment around the 
country, according to Western diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, as he acknowledged himself in Lithuania last week, is now in the 
most dangerous moment of his five years as the Soviet leader, and he has tied 
his own political fate to the successful resolution of the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just the question of Mikhail Gorbachev being the best, or the 
only, man for this job or perestroika being what the West has long prayed would 
happen in the Soviet Union," the Soviet diplomat said during the course of a 
background discussion of developments in Lithuania and the other Baltic 
republics of Estonia and Lativa. 
</P>
<P>
"The West must consider, as we do every day, that if Gorbachev fails, then his 
successor will not be following the same policies, not at all. If he fails, he 
will be replaced, and so will his policies." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking in Lithuania last week, argued strongly against secession 
by the Baltics, a right guaranteed them under the present Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and most other NATO members have never recognized the Soviet 
Union's incorporation of the Baltic republics, which gained their independence 
from Russia after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution but lost it after Josef 
Stalin's 1939 pact with Adolph Hitler dividing Eastern and Central Europe into 
Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Washington now takes the view that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will probably 
all succeed in winning some form of independence, according to Bush 
Administration officials, but has decided that the best policy for the United 
States is not to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of States James A. Baker III, however, is expected to discuss this 
issue during talks here next month with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet 
foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Shevardnadze asserted last week 
that, to carry out a successful foreign policy, the Soviet Union has to be a 
strong state, not one weakened by separatism and secession. 
</P>
<P>
Recent improvements in international relations, he said, were due largely "to 
Soviet perestroika and the fact that the Soviet Union is a strong state as a 
result, above all, of a strong alliance among brotherly nations." 
</P>
<P>
"If we would weaken this alliance, we would decrease the effectiveness of our 
foreign policy," he said. "Anything positive that is occurring now in the world 
would be undermined." 
</P>
<P>
The second point that Moscow has made to the West is its sensitivity to any 
reduction in its security. With the sweeping changes under way in Eastern 
Europe, which for more than 40 years has served as the Soviet Union's forward 
defense line, the Kremlin wants to ensure the stability of its own frontiers 
and their defense, according to these Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The military balance is obviously changing across Europe, and we believe that 
everyone will benefit from the reduction of the military forces deployed on the 
Continent," the diplomat said. "At the same time, the security of all nations 
must be preserved and the mutual confidence we have developed in Europe must be 
maintained. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In this context, Americans might consider how they would react if New England 
were talking about seceding, or Texas or the old Confederate states. These are 
issues of territorial integrity and sovereignty and, consequently, of 
security." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apprehensive Generals 
</P>
<P>
Another Soviet official, who has also briefed visiting Western delegations over 
the past month, commented: "Say that the Baltics declared their independence, 
would they be friendly to us, or neutral, or would they become a NATO outpost? 
You can see why our generals, who must defend the motherland, are very 
apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
The third point that Soviet officials are stressing in their warnings to the 
West is the danger of unleasing new and difficult-to-control forces through the 
separation of not only the Baltics but other Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
"We share the common hope that we are entering an era of greater peace and less 
international tension, but this could be upset through the revival, for 
example, of old national enmities, of militant Islamic fundamentalism, of 
unfulfilled expectations on the part of perhaps the Lithuanians or the Latvians 
when their new government cannot provide everything people hoped for," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The peace of the last four decades may have been a cold peace, but we should 
improve on it, not destroy it. What have we gained if, say, the Poles demand 
from independent Lithuania territory that used to be Polish and prepare to 
fight for it? What if the Latvians start to go bankrupt and they turn to an 
ultra-rightist, if not to say Nazi, force? And what about the Armenians, caught 
between the Turks, the Azerbaijanis and the Iranians, all Muslim and all 
militant?" 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet officials generally praise the "balance and prudence" shown by the 
Bush Administration on the Baltics question, they are sharply critical of the 
broadcasts by the two U.S.-run radio stations, Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, that broadcast to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in local 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
"These stations are calling for immediate secession, and their broadcasts are 
highly destabilizing," the party official said. "They broadcast the most 
extreme of the nationalist slogans, and in some cases, such as Azerbaijan and 
Armenia, set one nationality against another. These broadcasts are provoking 
internal strife and escalating conflicts, and we believe deliberately so." 
</P>
<P>
No longer jammed, the Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe broadcasts have large 
audiences in the Soviet Union because of their topicality, and they have been 
increased as Soviet residents have become able to call their headquarters in 
West Germany and discuss current developments in interviews that are then 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
"These two American radio stations seem quite ready to broadcast the most 
inflammatory material," the official said. "They appear to operate from the old 
Cold War philosophy that whatever harms the Soviet Union helps the United 
States, and that clearly is wrong today. Separatism endangers much more than 
the Soviet Union."

Author Salman Rushdie, in hiding for almost a year after his novel "The Satanic 
Verses" drew Iranian death threats, says he has not betrayed his Islamic 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not the enemy of my own people," he said in a telephone interview 
published in today's Guardian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel like the enemy of my people." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, 42, born to Muslim parents in India, declined to comment on his 
security situation but said, "You shouldn't assume that I have very much 
freedom at all." 
</P>
<P>
He went into hiding in Britain last February after Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini called on Muslims to kill him for blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
"One would wish the thing to come to an end," he said. "But I'm not the maker 
of the problem. I think if some of the people who protested about the book took 
the trouble to read it, they would see that it is not unsympathetic to them." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie said he has received many letters of support from Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he plans to write a book about his present situation, Rushdie 
replied: "It's not a question I can really begin to think about at the moment. 
In the future, who knows?"

Several Swiss lawmakers pledged help Sunday in tracing money that Nicolae 
Ceausescu reportedly hid in Swiss banks, but they said there was not yet proof 
any money had been transferred to Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich Ott, one of seven Swiss Parliament members meeting with Romanian 
officials, said there were reports that the executed Communist dictator had 
deposited $400 million in gold in Swiss banks before his ouster Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports suggested assets totaling up to $1 billion may have been smuggled 
to Switzerland or other foreign countries, Ott said. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich Rittmeyer, another lawmaker, said the process of finding Ceausescu's 
missing millions could take years. 
</P>
<P>
Ott said a Swiss inquiry into possible Ceausescu bank accounts included asking 
central banks in other countries to try to trace Romanian funds transferred to 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all convinced that if it can be verified that there is a fortune of the 
Ceausescu family, it must be returned," Ott said. "We have a moral 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which included lawyers and doctors, also discussed Swiss aid to 
Romania, Ott said.

Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that 
the armed forces offer black Americans equal opportunity with whites "more so 
than any other form of endeavor in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Powell, the first black to hold the nation's highest uniformed rank, also said 
he does not believe that the all-volunteer U.S. forces have become 
disproportionately black. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's out of proportion," he said, adding that "anybody who is 
willing to serve, qualified to serve, proud to serve should be allowed to 
serve." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks currently make up about 21% of the armed forces; about 12% of the U.S. 
population is black. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Powell was 
asked whether he considers the military system a "meritocracy" and whether it 
is an equal-opportunity employer. 
</P>
<P>
Powell replied: "More so than any other form of endeavor in our society. I'm 
very proud of what we have done in the military over the years and I think, for 
the most part, it is a meritocracy. You are not limited by anything but your 
own ability."

The Columbia astronauts soared past the halfway point of their 10-day space 
journey Sunday, focusing on experiments and photography as they spent a more 
relaxed day orbiting the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
After releasing one satellite and rescuing another last week, the five 
astronauts turned their attention to the mission's secondary goals -- several 
scientific and medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome on board Columbia on a Sunday afternoon," commander Daniel C. 
Brandenstein said while shuttle cameras beamed down sweeping views of the 
Earth. "Our Sunday, I think, was much like everyone else's Sunday around the 
country. It was probably one of our easier days during the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the midpoint, and the high visibility and exciting activities of 
Syncom deploy and rendezvous are behind us, but we're still working on numerous 
objectives in the materials processing and the extended duration orbiter 
medical experiments." 
</P>

Syncom, a Navy communications satellite, was released Wednesday. The Long 
Duration Exposure Facility, a scientific laboratory that had been in orbit 
nearly six years, was captured by the crew Friday and is now in the shuttle's 
cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenstein said crew members also filmed parts of the Earth with the powerful 
IMAX camera, including the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific. The IMAX footage 
is to be used in a film called "The Blue Planet." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the first half of the trip, flight director Al Pennington said: "It 
has been a flawless flight. We have a beautifully running orbiter." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day flight is the second-longest in 33 shuttle missions and is intended 
as a stepping stone toward longer shuttle flights and months-long stints aboard 
space station Freedom. Columbia is scheduled to land Friday at 2:59 a.m. PST at 
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the television shots beamed to Earth showed mission specialist Bonnie 
J. Dunbar checking on an experiment that suffered a mishap Friday but was 
repaired Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment involves melting and resolidifying the metal indium, which melts 
at a relatively low temperature. It was shut down while scientists on the 
ground studied videotape of a crack that had developed in a glass container, or 
ampul, within the experiment apparatus. Experts were concerned that the cracked 
glass could shatter, sending shards floating in the crew cabin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dunbar, wearing a mask and gloves, removed the cracked container and 
carefully vacuumed the machine, Pennington said. No glass fragments were 
discovered during the cleanup, and the broken ampul was replaced with a new 
one.

Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, in his first full day in office as the nation's first 
elected black governor, said Sunday the United States may be ready to elect a 
black as President in the "foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," was asked about 
the prospect of a black reaching the White House "in our time." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. When you say our time, I think that you mean . . . the foreseeable 
future. Yes, I do think that's a possibility," Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, a grandson of slaves raised in the segregated South who became a 
successful, wealthy attorney, was inaugurated Saturday. He said he sees a 
future in which "nothing is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, a Democrat, already has been mentioned as a possible moderate 
counterweight to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a role he has indicated he would 
relish. On the Brinkley show, he was asked to explain how he won a large number 
of white votes last year while Jackson has received only 15% of the white vote 
in presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I've been involved for a long time in running for office," he replied. 
"And I understand coalitions. I understand the need to compromise. . . . I do 
believe in taking the half loaf until you can get the other half." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Wilder watched as members of his Cabinet were sworn into office 
during a ceremony at the state Capitol and posed with them for photographs. 
Later, he hosted a brunch for campaign contributors and a reception for 
Democratic volunteers, both held at the Executive Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, whose election Nov. 7 focused attention on a state once strictly 
segregated, said in his inaugural address that his victory was "not a victory 
of party or the accomplishments of an individual, but the triumph of an idea -- 
an idea as old as America; as old as the God who looks out for us all."

SOVIET JEWS SEEN NEEDING LAND IN GAZA, WEST BANK

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that Israel has to hold on to the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for a mass wave of Jewish immigration from 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials predict that at least 300,000 Soviet Jews will move to 
Israel in the next three years as a result of new Soviet emigration policies 
and new U.S. restrictions on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said the sudden influx of Soviet Jews proves time is on Israel's side 
and will change the face of the Jewish state, making it "bigger, better and 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs around us are embarrassed. They are in a mood of defeat, stricken 
with fear," the 74-year-old leader told members of his right-wing Likud Party. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the success of Zionism and they have no answer for it. They have no 
cure. We have an answer, and of course it is not a Palestinian state. For the 
big immigration, we must have the land of Israel and we have to fight for it, 
struggle for it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if the government will settle Soviet Jews in the occupied 
territories, site of a 25-month-old Palestinian uprising, he told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"We will need a lot of room to absorb everyone, and every immigrant will go 
where he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's statements launched his campaign to defeat three hard-line Likud 
ministers challenging him for retracting the dismissal of Science Minister Ezer 
Weizman over alleged contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, architect of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, 
Housing Minister David Levy and Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai forced Shamir 
to convene Likud's central committee early next month. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said: "Everything is about to change here. With all the waves of 
immigration that will come . . . the state will be different, will look 
different. In another five or 10 years, we will not know it." 
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 Jewish settlers now live among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. Israeli rightists say mass immigration can help change 
the demographic balance there, strengthening Israel's presence.

The Swedish-born Lindfors, 69, suffered a facial wound that took 28 stitches 
but said she would not be intimidated by gangs. Dennis Beal, 36, of New York 
was slashed just a few minutes earlier Saturday morning and within 3 blocks of 
the spot in Greenwich Village where Lindfors was attacked. Beal suffered cuts 
on his face that required 40 stitches.

GENETICALLY ALTERED MICE MIMIC SICKLE CELL DISEASE

<P>
Scientists reported last week they have created mice with a disorder resembling 
sickle cell disease, an advance that may remove a major obstacle to developing 
treatments for the disorder affecting up to 100,000 Americans. A British 
research team said it has genetically engineered a strain of mice to contain 
the defective hemoglobin found in blood cells of humans with sickle cell 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Hemoglobin is a complex compound responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the journal Nature, a team led by Frank Grosveld of Britain's 
National Institute for Medical Research said it was able to create two 
genetically engineered mice containing relatively large amounts of human sickle 
cell hemoglobin in their red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
In test-tube experiments, blood cells taken from the mice were "sickled" under 
conditions that would cause similar deformities in cells taken from humans with 
sickle cell disease, researchers said. Other tests showed sickling also 
appeared to be occurring naturally within one of the mice. However, the 
researchers pointed out a major problem with their "sickle cell" mice is their 
failure to develop the anemia and other symptoms characteristic of the human 
disorder.

TWIN QUASARS' BIRTH REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An international team of astronomers last week reported that it may have 
witnessed the birth of a pair of quasars. Dr. Georges Meylan of NASA's Space 
Telescope Institute said his team has detected an object in the constellation 
Pisces that appears to be a pair of quasars separated by less than 100,000 
light years -- a small distance in cosmic terms. One light year equals about 6 
trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
Quasi-stellar objects, or quasars, are thought to be the very bright cores of 
certain galaxies, and some astronomers believe that their intense energy may be 
caused by their material being pulled inward to giant black holes. 
</P>
<P>
The international team, which also includes scientists from Caltech in Pasadena 
and from West Germany, said it has discovered what it believes to be the first 
true set of quasar "twins" using a 40-inch telescope near Le Serena, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
In findings presented at the American Astronomical Society's national meeting 
in Alexandria, Va., the researchers said the quasar twins lie so close together 
in space that astronomers speculate their gravity fields may be interacting 
with one another and spurring formation of the intensely bright objects.

U.S. BAN ON USING FETAL TISSUE DOESN'T STOP RESEARCH; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: NOVEL EXPERIMENTS IN ANIMALS STIR EXCITEMENT AMONG SCIENTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WEISS, Weiss is life science/biomedicine editor of Science News 
magazine in Washington, from which this article is adapted. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The timing was ironic. As 12,000 researchers gathered recently at the Society 
for Neuroscience's annual meeting, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan extended indefinitely a ban on federally funded fetal tissue 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which predominantly affects neuroscientists, forbids federal 
support for experimental transplants into humans of tissue from intentionally 
aborted fetuses. Continuing a ban initiated in March, 1988, by the Reagan 
Administration, it does not apply to transplants of animal fetal cells. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, rejecting the conclusions of a National Institutes of Health advisory 
committee convened last year, decided that "permitting the human fetal research 
at issue will increase the incidence of abortion across the country." 
</P>
<P>
Though the extended ban has angered many neuroscientists, researchers at the 
conference shared a wealth of data from novel experiments in animals -- many 
involving transplants of nonfetal nerve cells that may some day find 
application in humans. While most neuroscientists doubt nonfetal cells will 
ever match the therapeutic potential of fetal cells, this work stirs excitement 
among many researchers. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the potential of nonfetal substitutes, fetal cells remain 
neuroscientists' tissue of choice. Some experiments indicate fetal tissue may 
prove valuable in treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and other 
neurodegenerative conditions. For example, the first U.S. patient to receive 
such a transplant -- a 52-year-old man with a 20-year history of Parkinson's 
disease -- has responded to his surgery with significant improvements in 
mobility, reports Curt R. Freed of the University of Colorado School of 
Medicine in Denver, who performed the surgery with private funds in November, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The federal ban undoubtedly will minimize the number of such surgeries in the 
near future, further delaying any conclusions about the procedure's 
effectiveness in humans, Freed said. Moreover, the few privately funded U.S. 
researchers continuing to experiment with human fetal cell transplants complain 
bitterly about being relegated to the status of scientific renegades. 
</P>
<P>
But economic and political problems are not the only factors prompting 
neuroscientists to seek alternatives to human fetal cells. "The (funding) 
problems have in part stimulated people to look for alternatives, but this 
would have evolved even if there hadn't been a ban on fetal tissues," said Fred 
H. Gage of UC San Diego. "We're expanding our horizons; we're looking for 
options." 
</P>
<P>
Gage and his colleagues recently demonstrated that nonfetal cells do show some 
promise. Recently, they reported that they had successfully transplanted 
genetically engineered rat-skin cells called fibroblasts into the brains of 
rats with a syndrome resembling Parkinson's disease. Engineered to secrete the 
brain chemical dopamine, which has been found in short supply in Parkinson's 
patients, the cells alleviated the rats' symptoms by an average of 35% and may 
hold potential as a treatment for Parkinson's, said Gage and others. These 
experiments were described in the November proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with other nonfetal cells -- some 
gene-altered and some not -- with equally intriguing preliminary results. For 
example, many presentations at this year's neuroscience meeting focused on 
transplants of fibroblasts genetically engineered to produce substances such as 
nerve growth factor, a protein that stimulates nerve regeneration. These cells, 
when implanted into the brains of rats suffering from nerve damage, stimulate 
neuronal repair. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers have transplanted young astrocytes -- star-shaped, central 
nervous system cells -- from donor rats onto injured spinal cord tissue in 
recipient rats. Astrocytes belong to a class called glial cells, which provide 
physical and biochemical support for neurons. Reports at the neuroscience 
meeting indicate that transplanted astrocytes and other types of glial cells 
appear to improve coordination in the injured rats by stimulating the 
production of nerve-nurturing substances around the injury and by preventing 
scarring there. Tiny scars can block regenerating neurons from renewing 
connections with surviving nerve endings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very hot area to look for cells that secrete factors that may 
facilitate repair," Timothy J. Collier of the University of Rochester (N.Y.) 
School of Medicine and Dentistry said. "Everyone's very interested in glial 
cells, which seem to make damaged cells happier." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have begun genetically engineering glial cells in attempts to 
enhance their therapeutic potential. However, Freed said, "it will be some time 
before we become as comfortable with custom-made cells as we are with fetal 
cells, which we understand much better." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, scientists have yet to demonstrate that engineered cells can perform 
all the functions of their fetal counterparts. "I absolutely support 
(engineered) cell-line research to come up with improved transplant material," 
said D. Eugene Redmond, director of the neurobehavior laboratory at Yale 
University. "But the probability of taking something like a fibroblast and 
engineering into it all the factors necessary for neuronal function and 
communication so it knows who to talk to, when to release its transmitter. This 
may involve a thousand things." 
</P>
<P>
Added Gage: "It certainly is clear that fetal neuronal transplants are more 
effective than any of the other cell types at present." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fetal cells today seem awash in scientific praise. "Their ability to 
survive and multiply necessitates the grafting of only small numbers of cells . 
. . and they are adaptable to the host environment," wrote University of 
Rochester neurobiologists John T. Hansen and John R. Sladek in a review article 
in the journal Science. "The benefits of studying fetal cells are many, and the 
clinical potential for their use as therapeutic tools is just now being 
realized." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Redmond noted, gene-altered fibroblasts and other engineered cells 
"are going to be extremely suspect" because of their potential to divide 
uncontrollably, like cancerous tumors. "Some of these alternatives are going to 
have extreme liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Gage said, no one really knows whether fetal cells can live up 
to their exalted promise. Ban or no ban, he thinks researchers need to conduct 
more fetal cell transplants into animals -- a procedure allowed under the 
moratorium -- before embarking on widespread human trials. 
</P>
<P>
But until the fetal cell transplants into humans can proceed unimpeded, their 
value will remain an open question, Gage and others say. And the decision on 
whether to go ahead with such trials should be based upon scientific rationale, 
they insist. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the reasons for the ban had anything to do with bad science or good 
science or whether or not it's reasonable to pursue this work on scientific 
grounds," Gage said. "I can't believe that patients with degenerative diseases 
are not up in arms. It doesn't seem real. But, then, I'm a scientist."

Loss of genes that make interferon, a natural disease-fighting substance, has 
been linked with development of a form of leukemia, researchers said. The 
researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as regulators that stop 
the body's cells from becoming cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Chicago found an association between loss of 
the genes and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood cancer that 
is the most common form of childhood leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found that 29% of them 
lacked the interferon genes. Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list 
of cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of particular 
genes. 
</P>
<P>
Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's immune defenses 
and controlling cell growth.

NEA Commission Members Named: Four more members of the 12-person commission 
that will study possible changes in the structures of the National Endowment 
for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities were named Friday by 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine). The four new members include 
former Los Angeles City Councilman Rosalind Wyman; Kay Goodwin, a West Virginia 
arts advocate; Marcia Golden, a member of the Kansas state arts council; and 
Peter Kyros, a Washington area attorney well known in Democratic Party circles. 
</P>
<P>
Four other members were already selected for commission service last year by 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). President Bush will pick the 
additional four members and the White House said those appointments are 
undergoing clearance procedures by the FBI. The commission will examine the way 
the two endowments operate and recommend changes in the aftermath of the 
jarring censorship controversy that rocked the NEA last year. SHAUNA SNOW and

CBS' STRINGER DEFENDS RE-ENACTMENTS, PLANS A FIX ON 'SAJAK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer, speaking at a news conference in 
Universal City on Sunday, defended the networks' use of re-creations on Connie 
Chung's prime-time news program. He said that audiences can recognize the 
difference between "hard news" stories and re-enactments of events used 
responsibly in public affairs programs such as Chung's. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to 'out-tabloid' anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stringer also said the network is hard at work fixing its faltering Johnny 
Carson competitor, "The Pat Sajak Show," and defended himself and CBS president 
Laurence A. Tisch for taking part in creative decision-making for the 
prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Stringer said that "The Pat Sajak Show," rumored to be headed for cancellation, 
would bring Sajak out from behind the desk in attempts to inject some new 
energy. "We're not going to stay 'pat,' if you'll pardon the expression," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jeff Sagansky's hiring as president of CBS Entertainment, 
Stringer denied rumors that Sagansky had been reluctant to take the job because 
of possible creative interference from himself and Tisch and said Sagansky 
would have free rein to do his work. But, Sunday, Stringer said that the issue 
of creative control was not part of the negotiations and that Sagansky's hiring 
was delayed only by difficulties terminating Sagansky's Tri-Star contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I run the company, and Tisch runs the network -- it's a collaboration. . . . 
I've got every right to spend time out here (in Hollywood) and make the 
collaboration work for the network," Stringer said. DIANE HAITHMAN

CALCULATING BREAST CANCER RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers rely on an equation that takes into account four factors from a 
woman's medical history: 
</P>
<P>
* Age when menstruation began. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of negative breast biopsies she has had. 
</P>
<P>
* Her age at the birth of her first live-born child. 
</P>
<P>
* Family history of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Here are two cases of women, both 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Abby began menstruating at age 12. She has had one breast biopsy -- the 
extraction of a tiny bit of tissue for diagnostic examination -- that proved 
benign. She is childless and neither her motheres nor her sisters have ever had 
breast cancer. Based on this medical history, researchers calculate that she 
has a 10.1% chance of developing breast cancer within the next 30 years, about 
the same risk the average American woman faces. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara began menstruating before age 12 and has had one breast biopsy that 
also proved benign. She had her first child before age 20, which helps to 
reduce her risk of breast cancer, but both her mother and her sister have had 
the disease, which greatly increases her risk. This woman has a 39.8% chance of 
developing breast cancer within the next 30 years, or about four times higher 
than the general population. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of person that really has an unusual risk," said Mitchell H. 
Gail, head of the epidemiological-methods section at the NCI and a co-author of 
the paper. "This is a person who requires intensive observation."

EVERETT MERELY THE LATEST RAM TO TAKE A DIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe Dieter Brock wasn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
At least Dieter had reasons for his dog day afternoon at Soldier Field four 
years ago. The cold. The wind. Richard Dent. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no excuses," Jim Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the torch of Ram playoff failures passed from Roman Gabriel to John 
Hadl to James Harris to Pat Haden to Brock to young Everett. Everett didn't 
start the fire, but he didn't douse it, either -- taking time to place his own 
special stamp on the sorry big-game heritage shared by every Ram quarterback 
since Bob Waterfield. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ram fans can gnash their teeth over The Underthrow and The Undertow and 
the three interceptions and 20 incompletions that kept another Ram team on the 
porch of the Super Bowl, pinned to the welcome mat. 
</P>
<P>
The Underthrow was a play that simply couldn't fail, a play that developed so 
beautifully, so perfectly, so true to the playbook -- only to wind up tilting 
the windmills in Ernie Zampese's mind. 
</P>
<P>
Everett had the San Francisco defense faked all the way to Oakland, pulling 
back a handoff on an end-around to Ron Brown and rolling right to find Flipper 
Anderson counting grass blades near the 49er end zone. This was Jimmy Orr in 
Super Bowl III all over again. All alone, calling for the football, waiting for 
the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Everett spotted his man, but seemed to mistake Ronnie Lott for just another 
defensive back and gave the ball a slingshot throw when a mortar shot was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson had to break stride and slow down for the ball. Those precious 
milliseconds mattered mightily as Lott, sprinting in from another county, 
caught up with Anderson and the football and reached up just in time to flick 
the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
"The play of the game," said Ram Coach John Robinson, who watched a potential 
10-0 lead melt into eventual 30-3 obliteration at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised," Anderson said. "I was out there by myself and it was, 
like, no way he could miss me." 
</P>
<P>
But with the Rams, there's always a way. 
</P>
<P>
Everett called it "a misjudgment on my part. I probably could've put a little 
more zip on the ball. I thought it was one of those things where Flip was just 
going to catch the ball and walk into the end zone. I had no idea Ronnie could 
make that play." 
</P>
<P>
Flipper agreed with the part about using more zip. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I wish he would have, too," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The next play, Everett and Anderson misfired again, the Rams wound up punting 
and Everett had set the tone for a very atonal day. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' next two drives ended in Everett interceptions, two turnovers the 
49ers turned into touchdowns. By the time Everett threw his third interception, 
to Lott in the third quarter, the score was 24-3 and the quarterback of the 
'90s yearned for '89. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Everett was 16 of 36 for 141 yards. Only six of those completions 
came in the second half, with the Rams in dire need of an emotional jump start 
after trudging into intermission trailing, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
Everett called it his most frustrating day as a pro -- "up there with the 
Minnesota game of last year." That was another playoff stinker, with Everett 
throwing four interceptions in a 28-17 loss to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a vote for Sunday as undisputed champion. Not only did Everett bounce 
passes to Henry Ellard, ignore passes to secondary receivers and turn 49er 
safeties into primary receivers, but appearances count, too. And on third and 
10 with 3 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter, Everett gave the appearance he 
was giving up. 
</P>
<P>
On the play, Everett was entrenched in the pocket, surrounded by San Francisco 
linemen but not yet touched by any of them. Suddenly, Everett takes a dive. He 
flops on the turf and covers up the football, as if he's trying to save his 
body for that multi-year, multimillion dollar contract he's close to signing. 
</P>
<P>
Either that or some mysterious force brought him down. 
</P>
<P>
The Undertow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it didn't look great, trying to play tough football," Everett 
admitted. "But sometimes those things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to look upfield and I think they rushed three guys. They had 
everybody covered and I tried to step up to throw. Then, in the corner of my 
eye, I saw some one coming and I thought he was going to take a shot. I ducked 
under it." 
</P>
<P>
And almost underground. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the guy was going right at me and I tried to duck," Everett 
continued. "Someone's barreling in on you and it's a split-second decision. I 
was just trying to get the hell out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Everett seemed perplexed by the questioning about the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to make any highlight films, is it?" he said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
No, it was more symbol than highlight. An embodiment of Ram tradition: When the 
pressure's on, the Ram quarterback is going to take a fall. 
</P>
<P>
Everett may represent this franchise's future, but for the present, he's merely 
upholding the Rams' ignominious past. 
</P>
<P>
"This is when you've got to do it," Everett said. "You're playing the best. . . 
. I feel I'm improving in this league, but I'm not the best yet. Joe Montana 
is. I think he proved that today." 
</P>
<P>
Put it this way: Everett had one less interception than Montana had 
incompletions. Bay Area Joe passed 30 times against the Rams. Only four hit 
Candlestick soil before the hands of San Francisco receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback of the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s are here," Everett said. "Joe's creeping into the '90s. Things 
change, but it looks like he's going to be here a while." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hard day in the classroom for Everett and afterward, someone asked if 
he had any pointers to pass along to John Elway, the next quarterback to oppose 
Red And Gold Menace. 
</P>
<P>
Everett laughed. And laughed. For quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Everett suggested, "He's definitely going to have to mix it up. 
(Tailback) Bobby Humphrey gives him something to work with. As long as he mixes 
it up, he'll have a shot." 
</P>
<P>
And if, perchance, you have Vance Johnson isolated in the 49er secondary, with 
not a breathing soul around him, throw long, John. 
</P>
<P>
Really long.

COSTAS SICK, BUT ENBERG DOES IT ALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC's Dick Enberg was pressed into double duty Sunday when Bob Costas came down 
with a severe case of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Costas was so sick Sunday morning that he checked himself into a Denver 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Enberg, besides calling the game, also had to take Costas' place on the pregame 
and postgame shows. 
</P>
<P>
Then Ralph Wiley, who was scheduled to conduct postgame interviews in the 
Cleveland locker room, was stricken with the flu during the game. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Donovan, who does play-by-play for NBC on a part-time basis and works for 
the NBC affiliate in Cleveland, filled in for Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan fared better than O.J. Simpson, who could not remember Denver running 
back Sammy Winder's name during a postgame interview with quarterback John 
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk us through this touchdown pass to James Wa, Wa . . . Winder," Simpson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's it to?" Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
During his interview of Michael Young, Simpson congratulated the former Bruin 
and Ram on his 60-yard touchdown reception. It was 70 yards. LARRY STEWART

EX-RAM YOUNG IS A CATCH FOR BRONCOS

<P>
Once again, the Rams and Raiders won't be meeting in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
How about an ex-Raider vs. an ex-Ram? 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's ex-Raider linebacker Matt Millen of the 49ers vs. ex-Ram and 
ex-UCLA Bruin receiver Michael Young, who helped quarterback John Elway and the 
Broncos break up Sunday's AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Young, left unprotected by the Rams last winter and signed by the Broncos as a 
Plan B free agent, caught two passes -- one for 70 yards and a touchdown, the 
other for 53, setting up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here, I thought that if I made the team, I'd have a chance to 
participate and do some things," Young said. "But never to this extent. I never 
would have dreamed of having a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Mad at the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a change in philosophy," Young said. "There was a new offensive 
coordinator (Ernie Zampese) coming in and I wasn't his type of player. Hey, 
everybody has their opinion. I'm not upset at all at them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could say I had animosity toward 'em but I'd be lying if I said that. 
I almost stayed there because I knew I had a secure job as a backup receiver. 
But I knew that being a backup receiver on the Rams was like being a tackle. I 
mean, I knew I was never going to see any kind of action unless someone got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't leave because I liked it so much. But I tell you what, I like 
it a hell of a lot better here." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos played the second half without rookie running back Bobby Humphrey, 
and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Sammy Winder took over and gained 37 yards -- in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Will Humphrey be ready for the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves said he has two broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," said Humphrey, who will be X-rayed again today. 
</P>
<P>
Eight different Denver receivers caught passes, but when asked if Cleveland's 
secondary could have done anything differently to stop them, cornerback Frank 
Minnifield failed to come up with answers. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't pay me to make that evaluation," Minnifield said. "I'm the CB, not 
the HC." 
</P>
<P>
HC? 
</P>
<P>
"Head coach." 
</P>
<P>
OK. But what about . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even ask me," Minnifield said. "I didn't sit and watch the game. I 
played it. There was no thought process. They just pay me to cover wide 
receivers. You ask me to evaluate something, you ain't doing me no service 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
It was Minnifield who slipped and fell, freeing Young for his 70-yard touchdown 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson, despite the loss, was satisfied with his first season coaching the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down and out, everybody said we were finished," Carson said. "But 
we came back, week by week, every day except today. I'd say we made a hell of a 
run at it." 
</P>
<P>
What did Elway think of the crowd noise that drowned out Cleveland counterpart 
Bernie Kosar's signals? 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble hearing when we had the ball," Elway said. "I can only imagine 
what it was like for Bernie." 
</P>
<P>
Denver radio station KHOW played a new tune all week, sung to the tune of the 
old Coasters hit, "Charlie Brown." It went: 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're real clowns, those Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're gonna get beat, gonna miss the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the Denver Broncos always pickin' on us?

CARTER STILL LOOKING FOR A NEW ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He treated all of New York to a mile of smiles during the previous five 
seasons. Three months after removing his Mets' uniform for the last time, Gary 
Carter presented another face to a select audience. For a few moments, he was 
the catcher caught in a cry. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tools of his trade included a mask, Carter never hid behind it. 
For better or worse, he laid bare his feelings. Mostly, they were happy. Even 
the passing was no worse than bittersweet as he thought of what had been 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
It was played back for him on Friday as he and his wife, Sandy, were honored by 
the Leukemia Society of America during a luncheon at the Garden City Hotel. The 
program included a filmed tribute that touched on the highlights of his career 
with the Mets, right down to the double in his final at-bat in Shea Stadium in 
the last home game of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fighting back the tears then," Carter recalled. "To see it on film, it 
was tough not to let it go. I didn't think I was going to break down." But he 
did. Not that anyone seemed to mind. There were a few tears in the audience, 
too. A memorable era in Mets' history ended two days after the conclusion of 
the season when Keith Hernandez and Carter, Mex and the Kid, were told by 
management they would not be invited back. 
</P>
<P>
They were the senior citizens, the co-captains, the acknowledged leaders of the 
'86 championship team. The parting was not a shock. After all, both had spent 
the major portion of the year on the disabled list and their lucrative, 
long-term contracts had expired. Nevertheless, the news hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so final," Carter recalled. "It was very emotional. I thought back to 
all the things that had happened. It was like a marriage, really. I flew home 
to Florida on the day after the announcement. It took me a couple of weeks to 
get over it." 
</P>
<P>
The man returned to be saluted by the society for which he and his wife have 
donated considerable time. He has yet to find gainful employment with another 
major-league baseball club, his stated goal, but from his smile it appeared he 
had just celebrated a .300 season by signing a five-year contract. It's rarely 
been necessary for anyone to tell Gary Carter to keep his chin up. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some leads," he said. "There's nothing definite. I've been working all 
winter with a physical therapist and I feel fine. Unless my body tells me I'm 
finished, I expect to be back. I think there's a team out there that will be 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez has signed with the Cleveland Indians, but he doesn't have to squat 
on damaged knees. There was a time last season, Carter said, where he couldn't 
even bend. But the surgery from which he rushed back late last season has had 
time to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Carter did get back into uniform once in Florida and the reaction told him his 
skills still are in demand, if only by the people running the Senior 
Association. He asked the owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics if he could work 
out with the club before a game one night and the man agreed. When he taped an 
interview for a local television station in his borrowed Tropics' finery, word 
spread around Florida. 
</P>
<P>
He got offers from other clubs seeking his services. Among the callers was Earl 
Weaver, who said, "Our owner wants to sign you. And you won't have to play 
weekends." It was an offer Carter can and did refuse. 
</P>
<P>
The only affiliation he wants with senior baseball at the moment is the 
broadcasting duties he shares with his neighbor, Tommy Hutton. "If I'm healthy 
enough," he figured, "I should be able to play major-league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
If the man does make a comeback, it won't be in New York where he began the 
second phase of his career with a game-winning home run on Opening Day, 1985, 
before a crowd that included Vice President Bush. The VP has moved up and now 
Carter has moved on. 
</P>
<P>
He ran down the salaries the Mets are paying to the starting rotation and to a 
few other regulars. "And then they have to pay Darryl (Strawberry)," he said. 
"Keith and I were the odd guys out." 
</P>
<P>
They also were the old guys who were unable to provide leadership the club was 
so sorely lacking last season because they were able to play so little. As 
their roles diminished, the attitude of the Mets suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be interesting to see who steps forward," Carter said. "Maybe 
HoJo. Or Darryl. Kevin (McReynolds) is (too) quiet. And Darryl, if he doesn't 
get his new contract, you know how he'll be." 
</P>
<P>
But that's someone else's problem now.

PLANS OF IRVIN, SLATER SOURED BY 49ER ROUT

This wasn't the way they envisioned it. A Super Bowl ring would have been the 
perfect going-away gift, but Sunday's 30-3 drubbing in Candlestick Park was a 
retirement party from hell. 
</P>
<P>
Ram veterans LeRoy Irvin and Jackie Slater are both thinking seriously about 
putting an end to their professional football careers, but the quiet, steamy 
environment of a losing locker room hardly seemed the appropriate place for 
such an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," said Irvin, a 10-year veteran. "I didn't want to go 
out like this. I don't know for sure, but it doesn't look like I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep the door open a little bit, though. I'll see what happens with the 
Rams and the draft and the Plan B (free-agency) and all that. I'd hate to end 
it like this. But maybe it's time. It looks like that was my last hurrah and it 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Slater, an offensive tackle who is in his 14th year but still playing well 
enough to have been named to his sixth Pro Bowl team in the last seven seasons, 
expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," he said. "This was a good year for me. I'll take the memories 
of this year into the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rice gets more attention among the 49er receivers and Roger Craig is the 
star among the running backs, but Tom Rathman enjoyed the most productive day 
of all. The 27-year-old fullback rushed for 63 yards on 10 plays and caught 6 
passes for 48 yards, second on his team in both categories but second to none 
in value. 
</P>
<P>
His plays weren't glamorous but were crucial: on the 49er second touchdown 
drive, he gained six yards off tackle on a second-and-eight to set up Joe 
Montana's 15-yard pass to Craig for a first down, and he kept their third 
touchdown drive alive when he caught a Montana pass for 13 yards on a 
third-and-12 at the 49er 18-yard line. "Tom never ceases to amaze me," Rice 
said. "Once he gets a hole, he goes straight ahead and really covers some 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
49er cornerback Ronnie Lott offered consolation to several Rams as the teams 
walked off the field, and he saved some special words for quarterback Jim 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'Keep your head up. You've got a great career ahead of you,' " 
Lott said. "I expect to see him back in the same position in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Ram running back Greg Bell, reflecting on the season: "After today, the only 
positive thing is that we got a taste of a little success. We had the 
opportunity to become a world champ. We had the opportunity to get close. Other 
than that, everything's bad." 
</P>
<P>
After being routed by the 49ers, what do the Rams think of Denver's chances in 
the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
QB Jim Everett: "I don't think I want to be the Broncos playing these guys now. 
They're awfully good." 
</P>
<P>
DB Leroy Irvin: "They're gonna beat all over Denver. We were the only team who 
could beat them and we didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson: "Denver? I'm not sure they're going to call us for 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
The three points for the Rams was their lowest total since the last game of the 
1987 season, when they were shut out by the 49ers, 48-0. It also was the first 
time in two years that they hadn't scored at least 10 points and the first time 
since Oct. 30, 1988 that they hadn't scored a touchdown. In that game, against 
New Orleans, Mike Lansford kicked four field goals in a 12-10 Ram victory. 
Everett had thrown at least one touchdown pass in eight consecutive games 
before Sunday. The only other team to hold Everett scoreless this season was 
Chicago.

PASS SEEMS TO HANG AT THE TURNING POINT

<P>
Flipper Anderson saw a touchdown. Jackie Slater saw a touchdown. So did Irv 
Pankey, Jim Everett, Henry Ellard and nearly everyone in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell saw Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
Lott darted across the field and reached Anderson, the big-play receiver of the 
Rams, at the same time the ball did. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a simple incompletion. 
</P>
<P>
And possibly the turning point of a game during which the Rams were a split 
second from a 10-0 lead. Instead, they finished on the short end of a 30-3 NFC 
Championship game against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the play of the game," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "A lot of people 
might think it would have been 30-10, but I think we would have been a lot 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off to a good start and that would have given us a 10-point lead in the 
first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The play was a fake reverse to wide receiver Ron Brown. Everett dropped back 
from the 49er 40-yard line, faked to Brown and saw Anderson down the right 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I would have had a little more zip on the ball," Everett said. "I 
thought we had a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he thought the ball hung in the air. "Of course, receivers always 
think the ball stays in the air too long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the air just long enough for Lott. "I didn't know if I could get 
there on time because it was pretty wide," the all-pro safety said. "But then I 
saw the trajectory and I knew I could get there. If he would have overthrown it 
or if he (Anderson) would have kept running, I don't think I could have made 
the play." 
</P>
<P>
Everett missed his next pass, the Rams punted and the 49ers began a 13-play, 
89-yard touchdown drive that gave them a lead they would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a touchdown," Ellard said. "I don't know if it really hurt us 
by not scoring then, but it changed things." 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Slater also thought he was watching a touchdown. "It was 
almost there," Slater said. "But give credit to Ronnie Lott. He read it and he 
got there." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Bell, however, said he looked up when the pass was thrown, "and I 
saw where the ball was and I saw where Ronnie was. When I saw Flipper slow 
down, I saw Ronnie come running over. I knew it was either going to be a great 
catch or a great defensive play. It turned out their way. After that, they just 
outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
Everett had completed five of his seven passes to that point. He finished the 
half completing 10 of 20 with two interceptions. He threw another interception 
in the second half and completed only 16 of 36 passes for 141 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute well and they did," Everett said. "You have to put it in the 
air and get after it, and we didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey was quick to come to Everett's defense. "They came with a real good pass 
rush all game," he said. "People were in Jim's face. They just had a real good 
defensive scheme. They got it done and we didn't. They belong in the Super 
Bowl. They beat a real good team today in a dominating fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard and Anderson, each of whom gained more than 1,000 yards during the 
regular season, caught only three passes between them for 32 yards. "It was a 
combination of good coverage and a good defensive line today," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard said a key to the Ram passing attack is timing routes. "They just 
disrupted things today. But it has been a great year for us. We were on a 
roller coaster a little early and we worked out of it. We had to make things 
happen. We had to go back east and beat teams nobody thought we could. We made 
things happen. Until today." 
</P>
<P>
Bell said it was more than that one play that doomed the Rams. "The most 
important thing to do to this team (49ers) if you are going to win," he said, 
"is to do to them what they did to us. Keep the ball away from them.

NEWSWIRE: GLANVILLE IS HIRED BY FALCONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Glanville, who was an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons for three 
of the five winning seasons in the team's 24-year history, became Atlanta's 
head coach Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream come true," said Glanville, who first joined the Falcons in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm coming home." 
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Glanville, criticized by opposing coaches for allowing his 
players to use illegal tactics, got the job eight days after leaving the 
Houston Oilers, a team he took to the playoffs in each of the last three 
seasons. He replaces Marion Campbell, who resigned with four games left in the 
1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons were 3-13 this season, losing their last seven games. They drew a 
franchise-low crowd of 7,792 for their finale, a 31-24 loss to the Detroit 
Lions on Dec. 24.

Florida forward Livingston Chatman has decided to leave the basketball team for 
an indefinite period. The 6-foot-7 junior from Lakeland, Fla., cited an injured 
knee and burnout as reasons for leaving the team. 
</P>
<P>
Chatman did not attend Florida's 84-62 win over Auburn Saturday in Gainesville 
after it was announced he would not play because of a sore knee and an ankle 
injury sustained in Wednesday's loss at Kentucky.

King County prosecutors will decide this week whether to charge Seattle 
SuperSonic guard Dale Ellis with reckless driving and driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' attorney, Steve Hayne, said Ellis will plead not guilty if charged in a 
one-car accident that left Ellis hospitalized with three broken ribs and a 
collapsed lung. Ellis, who is 15th in NBA scoring with a 23-point average, was 
listed in satisfactory condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE GIVEN LAST RITES AS CANCER TAKES ITS TOLL

Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte was given last rites today in 
the gravest crisis of his 18-month battle against terminal cancer, relatives 
and his physician said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really difficult situation," Dr. Jose Luis Saca said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's dying." 
</P>
<P>
Saca said Duarte's stomach and liver cancer, first diagnosed in June, 1988, had 
spread throughout the abdominal cavity. He said the 64-year-old former 
president was in a "stupor," only waking when stimulated by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said a Roman Catholic priest had given Duarte the last rites, a 
sacrament administered shortly before death. 
</P>
<P>
The former president was given the last rites during a severe relapse in 
September, but he later recovered. At that time Saca said Duarte appeared to 
have "more lives than a cat."

Los Angeles police this morning identified a man killed when he stepped in 
front of a car on a Studio City street as a transient who had previously been 
cited for jaywalking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
John William Kocan, 46, was killed about 7 p.m. Sunday when he walked out into 
traffic on Coldwater Canyon Avenue near Dickens Street and was struck by a 
northbound car, Detective Don Bellante said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify the driver of the car because he was not cited in 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the driver's fault," Bellante said. "This guy wandered out into the 
street where there was no crosswalk and into the traffic. He had done this 
before." 
</P>
<P>
The detective said results of tests to determine if Kocan was intoxicated when 
struck by the car Sunday were not completed.

The Kremlin declared a state of emergency in Nagorno-Karabakh and other areas 
of Azerbaijan and Armenia today and sent in army, navy and KGB units to quell 
what it said were attempts to overthrow Soviet power by force. 
</P>
<P>
The decree, the toughest of its type issued in the Soviet Union since the end 
of the civil war that followed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, said forces of 
the three services would back up Interior Ministry troops already there. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment the situation has become particularly tense in the 
cities of Baku, Gyandzh (Kirovobad), and a number of other population centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It has reached the point of murders, robberies and attempts at armed overthrow 
of Soviet power and at changing by force the state and social system enshrined 
in the constitution of the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media reports said Azerbaijanis and Armenians with submachine guns 
battled in ethnic clashes that have claimed at least 32 lives, the worst 
bloodletting between the two ethnic groups since their long-simmering feud in 
the Caucasus boiled over nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The local authorities are helpless," Izvestia newspaper correspondent Yuri 
Orlik wrote from the capital of Baku. "Sometimes they do not even try to stop 
the extremists as it was in Nakichevan" where Azerbaijanis battered down the 
barbed wire border with Iran a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Literally 65 feet from a police station, two charred corpses had been tossed 
on a garbage heap like horrible black dolls and bodies were being burned at the 
train station square," a correspondent for Tass press agency said in a dispatch 
from Baku. 
</P>
<P>
"In front of our very eyes, soldiers repulsed two young men who were dragging a 
woman into the yard," the correspondent said. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television said 300 Azerbaijanis and Armenians fought in the 
Shaumyanovsk region of Azerbaijan, near the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. It quoted a soldier as saying Armenians fought back with 
hunting rifles and Kalashnikov submachine guns when a group of Azerbaijanis 
tried to set fire to an Armenian farm. 
</P>
<P>
Attacks on the homes of Armenians living in Azerbaijan continue, with more 
killings and six more bodies found, the TV news program "Vremya" said. Four of 
the dead were Armenians, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Sevinth Abdulayeva, the chief editor of Azerbaijan's official news agency 
Azerinform, said in a telephone interview that Armenians hiding in the woods 
were firing on passing cars in Shaumyanovsk and an adjoining region. She said 
the Armenians were receiving guns and ammunition ferried in by unmarked 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The violence, which exploded Saturday night with an anti-Armenian riot in the 
oil-producing center of Baku, is "reminiscent of news from the warfront" in 
World War II, Soviet TV commentator Igor Kudrin said grimly. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said at least 32 people had died in the last three days in 
anti-Armenian rampages in Baku, a city of 1.7 million, alone but that the 
figure could rise as other ransacked apartments were inspected. 
</P>
<P>
Attacks on the homes of Armenians were continuing, with more killings, Soviet 
TV said. It said 34 people, mostly Armenians, had been injured.

ECHOES OF STRIFE HAUNT U.S. ON KING'S BIRTHDAY

Church bells across the country tolled the loss of Martin Luther King Jr. today 
as echoes of the racial conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to 
overcome continued to haunt the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, worshipers at King's church were urged on the slain civil rights 
leader's birthday to keep alive his memory and his philosophy of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man who is a deep current in our memory," said the Rev. Cecil 
Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco. 
"Let us live then not only his dream, but let us live the practice of 
nonviolence and unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church. 
</P>

Church services, parades and other celebrations were held nationwide during the 
weekend before the federal holiday, which for the first time falls on the slain 
civil-rights leader's actual birthday. 
</P>
<P>
He would have been 61 today. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Mayor Tom Bradley observed the holiday today by ringing the 
City Hall bell three times. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, meanwhile, demonstrated at the 
downtown headquarters of Security Pacific Bank to protest the bank's decision 
to stay open on the federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned today in Atlanta was a "March of Celebration" parade, being 
televised nationally for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats, apparently 
racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flare-up of racial tensions in 
Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white man had claimed that a black 
mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife. 
</P>
<P>
It also comes at a time of gains for blacks -- the election of David N. 
Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's first elected 
black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the world," said James 
Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial Equality, as he pounded three times 
with his fist on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. "Those who have been denied 
liberty love it most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, one of just four states without some form of King holiday, 
thousands marched in Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed 
crowd carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown Phoenix as 
they headed for a rally at the Capitol.

Hilda the hippo's brief taste of freedom ended in tragedy today. 
</P>
<P>
The three-ton hippopotamus escaped from her trailer onto a busy four-lane 
English highway but died after being shot with a tranquilizer dart while being 
recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't survive the drug that was used and the stress and trauma of the 
recapture," said Roger Cawley of Longleat Safari Park, Hilda's owners. 
</P>
<P>
Hilda, aged 10, was on her way to be paired with a mate at another safari park 
when her trailer ran out of control near Thruxton in Hampshire, allowing her to 
break free. Motorists swerved to avoid her and police sealed off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Cawley said Hilda grazed quietly by the roadside for nearly two hours but 
failed to survive the difficult rescue involving pulleys, ropes and a tractor.

Fewer than 2,000 spectators are expected when the space shuttle Columbia, 
loaded with a bus-sized satellite, makes its late-night landing this week on 
the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The landing, scheduled for 11:59 p.m. Thursday, will be only the second at 
night for a shuttle. Columbia, which has no running lights, will touch down on 
a concrete runway about five miles from the public viewing area. 
</P>

"You'll hear a 'whoosh' sound as it comes through the air but you won't see 
it," so no more than 2,000 people are expected, NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato

Lithuania's Communist Party chief was overwhelmingly elected the republic's 
president today in a clear endorsement of his defiant stand toward Moscow and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Algirdas Brazauskas was elected 228 to 4, with 19 abstentions, by the 
republic's Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass press agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The republic's Supreme Soviet also voted to limit voting rights for military 
personnel, requiring them to have lived in Lithuania for at least 10 years, 
said Eduardas Potasinskas, a journalist for Lithuanian TV. The measure in 
effect restricts voting in local elections Feb. 24 by servicemen to those from 
Lithuania or a few long-serving soldiers and sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, 57, faced two alternative candidates: national Legislator Kazimeras 
Motieka and Romualdas Ozolas, a leader of the pro-independence group Sajudis. 
</P>
<P>
Potasinskas said the vote will "strengthen the position of Brazauskas in 
dealing with Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas backed the Lithuanian party's decision Dec. 20 to break away from 
the national Communist Party, the first such break since the Communists took 
over in Moscow in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who had denounced the move, visited Lithuania from Thursday through 
Saturday to try to persuade Lithuanian Communists to reverse their decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians refused to budge, and Gorbachev failed to end the schism. He 
concluded his visit Saturday by saying he saw "no tragedy" in a multiparty 
system -- a change from his previous unconditional call for a one-party system.

$1-BILLION U.S. CO-OP VENTURE TO MAKE COMPUTER CHIPS FOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-flying U.S. venture to regain control of the vital computer chip 
industry from Japanese dominance folded today because it failed to attract 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara-based U.S. Memories Inc. was hailed as a $1-billion cooperative 
venture by American companies, but in its seven brief months of life it failed 
to make a single computer chip or earn a single dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely disappointed by this turn of events," Sanford L. Kane, 
president of U.S. Memories, said at a news conference. "What happens today does 
not bode well for an industry that has made a technical decision rather than a 
tactical one." 
</P>
<P>
Kane told the crowded news conference that the joint venture will be 
"terminated," largely because of a lack of support from the electronics 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The venture had not found a new investor since its formation last June by seven 
big-name backers -- International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment 
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., National 
Semiconductor Corp. and LSI Logic, according to published reports.

As Bloomingdale's staff prepared to open shop this morning, Chairman Marvin 
Traub's somber voice suddenly echoed over the loudspeaker, announcing that the 
parent company of their beloved Bloomie's had filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
"He said this wasn't the beginning of the end and not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone just stood there. One woman said she felt like World War II had 
just been announced," said one employee who sells ties in the century-old 
mid-town department store. 
</P>
<P>
But most staff said New York's glitziest store is too special to fall victim to 
unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Bloomingdale's will always be here. New Yorkers will not let it go out of 
business. This store is a landmark," one saleswoman in accessories said. 
</P>
<P>
A customer agreed, saying: "It's special, uniquely New York. This store is a 
flagship. Take a look at who comes here to shop -- it's the people who set the 
style in New York.'

The European Community's unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low of 8.9% 
during November, EC's statistics agency Eurostat announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in November -- from 9% in October and 9.7% in November, 1988 -- put 
the jobless rate below 9% for the first time since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Henning Christophersen, the EC's economic affairs commissioner, said the drop 
showed the investment and growth-oriented policies of the 12-nation trading 
bloc were working. 
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said national unemployment rates either fell slightly or were 
unchanged in November except in West Germany and Denmark. The rise in West 
Germany reflected the movement of East German workers to the West seeking jobs, 
the statement said.

Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July" again topped the weekend movie box 
office chart, taking in $8 million at 1,315 theaters across the U.S. But the 
film's business dipped 25% from its previous weekend grosses, the largest drop 
by any of the top five films in wide national release. 
</P>
<P>
Danny DeVito's marriage-on-the-rocks comedy, "The War of the Roses," kept its 
affair with moviegoers going, grossing $5.8 million -- a 17% decline -- to 
finish second while the Kurt Russell-Sylvester Stallone buddy-cops drama, 
"Tango and Cash," held on to the No. 3 spot with a $5.4 million weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Figgis' "Internal Affairs," a violent drama about the investigation of a 
corrupt Los Angeles cop, led all newcomers in the market, grossing a solid $5 
million at 975 theaters. Three other new releases -- "Leatherface," a sequel to 
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Downtown," and "Ski Patrol" -- all did poor 
opening weekend business while Ed Zwick's critically-praised Civil War drama, 
"Glory," expanded from 8 to 392 screens where it averaged a very strong $7,653.

Guitars are still thrashed and arenas trashed, but one thing has changed on 
Motley Crue's latest tour: The heavy metal bad boys remember what they do. 
</P>
<P>
"We only remember bits of past tours," lead singer Vince Neil said in this 
week's People magazine.

Booze, drugs and more drugs left the band members' memories as fuzzy as their 
guitar sound, until bassist Nikki Sixx nearly died of a heroin overdose in 
1987.

The entire Crue checked into a drug rehabilitation program, and now a drug 
counselor follows them around on tour to help them stay on the wagon, the 
magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
But concert-goers haven't yet mistaken the group for advocates of temperance. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just play rock 'n' roll, we live it," Sixx said. "We go on tour and 
get broken bones, diseases, the crowd leaves bloody. It's more like going to 
war."

Rock superstar Bruce Springsteen and his girlfriend, Patti Scialfa, are 
expecting a baby, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
USA Today said Columbia Records confirmed the pregnancy but did not say when 
the baby is due or whether the couple will marry. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at New York-based Columbia Records could not be immediately reached 
for comment today; the telephone was answered with a recording because of the 
Martin Luther King holiday. Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, did not 
immediately return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, his former backup singer, revealed their romance 
publicly in the spring of 1988, after Springsteen and his wife, actress 
Julianne Phillips, split up. He had married Phillips in 1985; the couple had no 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen is known for such hits as "Born in the U.S.A.," "Hungry Heart" and 
"Born to Run."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: AGGRESSIVE PROMOTION OF BALDNESS REMEDY CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON

<TEXT>
<P>
Q. Why is the Upjohn Co. promoting its baldness remedy so aggressively? 
</P>
<P>
When I first saw the ads for Rogaine, I called the toll-free 800 number just to 
see what would happen. I have been bald for years, and what I've read in your 
column about this drug is not very encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
They sent a letter recommending three doctors in my area who could prescribe 
Rogaine along with a $10 certificate to help pay for the visit. But $10 doesn't 
pay for a doctor visit by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
I recently received a follow-up letter urging me to make an appointment and 
redeem my certificate. I'm angry because I feel this is a violation of my 
privacy. Are they so desperate that they have to keep hounding me? How do I get 
my name off their mailing list? 
</P>
<P>
A. Rogaine Topical Solution (minoxidil) has not taken the market by storm. 
Although it is the sole FDA-approved baldness treatment, only about 30% to 40% 
of the men who use Rogaine get noteworthy results. 
</P>
<P>
Someone such as yourself who has been bald for a long time probably won't see 
much improvement. And you'd be out a lot more than $10 to have a doctor tell 
you that. 
</P>
<P>
The full-page ads, toll-free numbers and $10 rebates are unusual tactics for 
promoting prescription medicine. To get your name removed from their list, you 
may have to write to the Upjohn Co., P.O. Box 9030, Opa Locka, FL 33054-9944. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I read in a magazine article that Monistat, a prescription cream used for 
vaginal infections, is the same as Micatin, an over-the-counter athlete's foot 
remedy. 
</P>
<P>
I checked Micatin at the drugstore, and it is much less expensive than the 
Monistat my doctor prescribed last week. If these two drugs are really the 
same, couldn't I use the Micatin instead of refilling my prescription? 
</P>
<P>
A. This is a tricky one. The anti-fungal ingredient in Micatin athlete's foot 
cream is miconazole, the identical drug in Monistat vaginal formula. Even the 
inactive ingredients are the same. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-gram tube of Micatin purchased over-the-counter costs about $8, whereas 
the prescription 45-gram tube of Monistat is almost $20. 
</P>
<P>
Vaginal infections should not be self-diagnosed. But if your doctor decides 
that you need Monistat again, you might ask him about substituting Micatin.

Talk show host Oprah Winfrey encouraged Dallas to take a lead role in her 
campaign to focus attention on children's problems. 
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 people showed up at a benefit show in which Winfrey encouraged 
adults to support and nurture children and to bring underprivileged children 
into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Let this city be the model city for making a change, making a difference," she 
told several hundred people at a reception before Saturday's show. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey promised to return to Dallas in December for a talk show featuring an 
audience of Dallas residents who follow through on pledges to work with 
children throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Greatness is determined by service," Winfrey told the benefit show crowd. "It 
is determined by your willingness to do all that you can to make sure that 
people have the quality of life that really is our birthright."

NUNN SEIZED ON TRAFFIC WARRANT AFTER RUN-IN WITH ARMED DRIVER

Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, has 
been arrested on a traffic warrant after he chased down a motorist who had 
rear-ended his Mercedes. The man later threatened Nunn with a knife, according 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager, said the boxer aggravated a back injury in the 
crash and would be examined by doctors later this week. A scheduled Jan. 27 
fight between Nunn and Marlon Starling was canceled last month when Nunn 
allegedly injured his back in a fall at his home in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic accident occurred in Van Nuys late Saturday night, police said. 
Nunn's 1989 Mercedes was struck by a car driven by Nicholas Munoz, 57, of Van 
Nuys. Munoz, police said, then drove away from the scene, with Nunn driving in 
pursuit. The boxer eventually forced Munoz' car to the side of the road, and 
both drivers got out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn told police that Munoz then pulled a knife on him. When officers arrived, 
Munoz had a bloody nose. They did not know whether Nunn had punched the other 
driver or whether the injury occurred in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn was arrested when a computer check showed an unpaid speeding ticket he had 
received in December. He was held briefly in the Van Nuys jail and then 
released when Goossen posted $3,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz was charged with felony hit-and-run driving, assault with a deadly weapon 
and suspicion of drunken driving. He was still being held on $2,500 bail in the 
Van Nuys jail today.

6TH-SEEDED MAYOTTE OUSTED IN FIRST ROUND OF AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
</P>

<P>
Teen-ager Pete Sampras served notice that another U.S. tennis star was rising 
by outlasting sixth-seeded Tim Mayotte 7-6 6-7 4-6 7-5 12-10 today in an 
all-American clash in the first round of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Emilio Sanchez, seeded seventh, was another opening-day victim, 
succumbing to big-serving Frenchman Jean Fleurian, ranked 57 in the world, by 
6-2 6-4 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, the queen of women's tennis, survived a scare in the second set 
against 17-year-old American Carrie Cunningham, trading hammer forehands for 75 
minutes before winning 6-2 7-5 on a day that mixed rain and sunny spells. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, the men's top seed and defending champion, found his best form 
elusive but moved safely into the second round of the first grand slam 
tournament of the 1990s, beating American Jim Pugh 6-3 6-2 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras took four hours and 45 minutes to wrap up his second victory in six 
days over Mayotte, who signed his own death warrant by serving double faults on 
the final two points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier saving himself with an ace on his second serve on match point 
against him, Mayotte was left regretting his frail second serve that caused him 
to serve 11 double faults in the protracted final set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real Achilles' heel for me," said Mayotte, who had appeared well beaten 
at 4-1 down in the final set before rain caused a 26-minute interruption. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough because I've trained as hard as I've ever trained for two months 
and was very excited at coming down here. That's the way the chips fall, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Sampras, who initially came to prominence by beating Mats 
Wilander in last year's U.S. Open, admitted the match could easily have swung 
the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very lucky," he said. "But most of the guys on the tour know Tim has a 
pretty shaky second serve, especially in tight situations." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who has not dropped a set in winning two successive titles here, lost her 
touch for several games in the second set to present the left-handed Cunningham 
with a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the moment of truth proved too much for the 1988 U.S. Open junior champion, 
and the West German world No. 1 conceded just five more points before wrapping 
up victory in a thrilling match with two successive aces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's everyone's nightmare to play Steffi in the first round, but I was proud 
of the way I played," said Cunningham, 17. "I couldn't believe it when I was 
5-2 up. I was so astonished I think that's what made me start making errors." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who came close to collapse last year from heat exhaustion, played during 
the hottest part of the day and wore a Foreign Legionnaire-type hat to ward off 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
He broke Pugh, who won the 1988 and 1989 doubles titles with fellow American 
Rick Leach, in Pugh's opening service game and quickly wrapped up the first 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The second set resembled a comedy of errors with both players drawing groans 
from the crowd with a welter of unforced mistakes before Lendl grabbed the 
vital break in the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl attributed his unimpressive showing to his early departure in last week's 
New South Wales Open where he was beaten in the quarterfinals by France's 
Yannick Noah. 
</P>
<P>
"I had too much stored energy and I was over-hitting like crazy," Lendl told 
journalists.

Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona will not be punished by the International 
Soccer Federation for his allegations that last month's World Cup draw was 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Guido Tognoni, a spokesman for the federation known as FIFA, said the $7,700 
fine imposed by the Italian soccer league was sufficient and, as far as his 
organization is concerned, the matter is closed. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian league's disciplinary commission Friday announced the fine against 
the captain of Argentina's national team and the Naples team, which leads the 
Italian league. The tribunal, which had jurisdiction because Maradona plays for 
an Italian team, said he had ridiculed the Italian organizers of the World Cup 
by claiming the pairings of the six groups had been decided prior to the 
official draw in Rome on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA had originally threatened to ban Maradona from the World Cup finals if he 
repeated the allegations.

OFF TONIGHT'S OHIO VALLEY CONFERENCE GAME.

<P>
Injuries and the suspension of eight players have forced Middle Tennessee State 
University to forfeit tonight's Ohio Valley Conference game to Tennessee State, 
MTSU Coach Bruce Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The eight Middle Tennessee State players were suspended Friday by conference 
Commissioner Dan Beebe for a bench-clearing brawl with Tennessee Tech last week 
in Murfreesboro. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to Kevin Snell and Gerald Harris left the Blue Raiders with only three 
players from the 12-man team to play Tennessee State at Gentry Center. 
</P>
<P>
While Beebe gave Middle Tennessee State the option to immediately bench four of 
his suspended players over the next three games and then suspend the remaining 
players, Stewart said he'd rather forfeit a game now. 
</P>
<P>
"We exercised the option to sit out all of the suspended players at once and 
return our team to a whole unit as quickly as possible," Stewart said. "We will 
not drag out the suspensions." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart apologized Sunday night to TSU and to fans from both teams. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and his staff had checked the campus for athletes and found a 
few from the football team. With administration offices closed for the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday, Stewart said he could not have them certified by 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
TSU Coach Ron Abernathy, though, is not happy with the automatic conference 
win. "We've lost people right and left, but we've shown up for every game. When 
I first heard about this I thought it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy said the Ohio Valley Conference should force MTSU to forfeit the rest 
of its conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Tech, which had six players suspended, played Saturday night and 
defeated Tennessee State 89-82. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee State's game with Middle Tennessee State is usually the school's 
biggest draw with as many as 10,000 tickets sold.
