HOLIDAY MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year we go crazy from Thanksgiving through Christmas and New Year's Day. 
What a sham! What a shame! 
</P>
<P>
The holiday season does us more harm than good. Though promising peace and joy, 
this time of year brings depression, debt, dyspepsia and drunkenness. Bah 
humbug. 
</P>
<P>
Let's end the traditional madness of forced togetherness, hypocritical 
sentimentality, fattening food, debilitating drink, rampant commercialism and 
meaningless ritual. It's not worth the pain. 
</P>
<P>
These winter holidays were designed by primitive societies to relieve their 
fear of the dark. But we today don't need exorcism. We are free to celebrate 
life year-round without all the hype, hoopla and high expectations 
traditionally programmed into one crazy month of the year.

President Reagan's ignorance of the race problem in the United States has 
rarely been so apparent as in his response to Mike Wallace on "60 Minutes" 
Sunday evening. He was asked why is he so negatively viewed by blacks. He 
replied by speculating that he was a victim of a conspiracy of black leaders to 
keep alive the issue for personal profit. "Sometimes I wonder if they really 
want what they say they want because some of those leaders are doing very well 
leading organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that they're victims 
of prejudice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Where has the President been these past eight years that he can be so detached 
from the brutal reality of the effect of his policies and his programs and his 
leadership on black Americans? How is it possible that he can be so blind to 
the polarization, the frustration, the growing anger of blacks who feel, with 
good reason, that they have been left out? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. President: You should know that the blacks in the United States continue to 
be victims of prejudice, of pervasive injustice, and that prejudice is not of 
their creation. It is not the invention of their leaders, nor is it a fiction 
perpetuated for personal gain. And this racism, this injustice, will continue 
to erode the nation until it is understood that its solution is the 
responsibility of everyone, but above all of the highest leaders of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
So we welcome President-elect George Bush's commitment Monday to ensure "that 
bigotry and indifference to disadvantage will find no safe home on our shores, 
in our public life, in our neighborhoods or in our homes."

PROTECTING THE HIGH-RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has another chance to provide the same degree of fire 
protection for everyone who lives or works in high-rise buildings. It should 
jump at it. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkler systems, designed to prevent the rapid spread of fire, are required 
in all high-rise buildings in the city except older high-rise apartment and 
condominium buildings. People who live in those 97 buildings can have the same 
protection if the City Council approves a proposed ordinance that will come 
before its Police, Fire and Public Safety Committee on Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974 the city has required sprinkler systems for all new commercial and 
residential high-rise buildings. After the devastating First Interstate Tower 
fire last spring, the city told owners of older high-rise office buildings to 
start installing sprinklers. The council exempted older apartment buildings, 
and that omission must now be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would give building owners a year to offer plans for 
retrofit work and two years to do the work. They could have another year if 
they were also removing asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The council must keep in mind people on low or fixed incomes who live in some 
of the older buildings. They cannot afford hefty rent increases to cover 
sprinkler costs, and the proposed ordinance attempts to provide for their 
needs. If the city Building Department and the Fire Department agree, some 
high-rise owners could install less elaborate, and less expensive, sprinkler 
systems. But they will still need the fire pumps called for in tall buildings 
as well as the kind of fire doors required in an ordinance passed after another 
disastrous fire at the Dorothy Mae apartments on Sunset Boulevard in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles government also needs to protect its own buildings. Toward that 
end, the City Council has placed on the April ballot a $60-million bond issue 
for sprinkler work and asbestos removal in six city buildings constructed 
before 1974. Those include City Hall, Parker Center and City Hall East, which 
houses Fire Department headquarters. Those bonds would help pay for important 
protection for city workers. Council action on the city's own sprinkler 
situation would also deprive building owners of an excuse for delay. 
</P>
<P>
The flames that killed one man and gutted four floors of the First Interstate 
Tower last May would not have spread as quickly had sprinklers been in place. 
Sprinklers did snuff out flames on the 28th floor of the Wells Fargo Tower 
later in the year. The lesson is obvious.

NICARAGUA LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The past seven years have not been easy for Nicaraguans who have peacefully 
opposed the drift of the Sandinista government. They have been harassed and 
repressed by would-be totalitarians at home, and undercut and ignored by 
friends abroad, especially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The shortcomings of U.S. policy in Nicaragua were illustrated recently by Times 
correspondent Richard Boudreaux. One report described a visit to a Honduran 
base camp, where anti-Sandinista Contra fighters patiently await more U.S. 
military aid so that they can resume their guerrilla war against the regime in 
Managua. The other covered a peaceful protest march last Sunday by the broadest 
anti-Sandinista coalition yet assembled there -- a demonstration that drew 
4,500 persons, from Communists to right-wing businessmen. Contras and civilians 
both want to change Nicaragua's government, but the difference in their 
approaches is instructive. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras and their leaders talk a brave game but are doing little. Millions 
of dollars in humanitarian aid from Washington probably makes them the best-fed 
and -clothed guerrillas in history.It's easy for them to talk confidently about 
future victories after the arms start arriving again. But in seven years of 
fighting the Contras have achieved little except to harass the Sandinistas and 
give them a scapegoat to blame for all of Nicaragua's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Nicaragua's problems stem from an economy that is in shambles as a 
result of constant warfare and that feeds discontent among the populace. But 
many outsiders thought that organized displays of discontent with the 
Sandinistas died out last July, when police arrested several leaders of the 
movement after an opposition rally turned violent. But on Sunday the government 
had to relent and stand aside for yet another demonstration. So the loyal 
opposition -- which includes 13 political parties, several labor unions and 
business organizations and elements of the Roman Catholic Church -- thrives, 
with nothing like the U.S. support that the Contras enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lesson here for President-elect George Bush, if he is at all tempted 
to follow President Reagan's stubborn, macho policy toward Nicaragua. If he 
does, he will fail as surely as Reagan and his Contras did. A Bush 
Administration would be better off doing what it can to encourage the loyal 
civilian opposition inside Nicaragua as it struggles to change things in that 
country peacefully.

LOS ANGELES MAYOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commendations are in order for Yaroslavsky. According to The Times, he has 
decided to withdraw from the mayoral campaign because of poll results showing 
Mayor Tom Bradley's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign would certainly have increased intergroup tensions in Los Angeles. 
While I respect the councilman and the mayor and doubt that either one would 
have tried to win by inflaming already threatening intergroup conflicts, I have 
less confidence in the campaign "professionals" whose only motivation appears 
to be to win, and to win at any cost.

My sincere thanks to the Honorable Zev Yaroslavsky.

Now that Yaroslavsky is seeking reelection as a councilman, I am no longer 
forced to choose the "lesser of the evils" for 5th District Council office. No 
matter what my concerns, from tree trimming to senior citizen issues, his 
office has always been able to help me. 
</P>
<P>
His approach to planning issues has been good for both the city and the 
district. He is more concerned with what will serve the needs of his district 
than the needs of a select group of individuals. I am sorry he is not running 
for mayor, but at least we will have four more years of his leadership in 
addressing the needs of the 5th District.

JAPAN MUST STOP 'FLEEING' ASIAN NEIGHBORS AND CLEAN THE WARTIME SLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NAOKI SAKAI, Naoki Sakai is a professor of literature at Cornell University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the death of Emperor Hirohito, Japan now has its fourth emperor since the 
Meiji Restoration of 1868, when it began to build the modern ten'nosei, an 
emperor system suitable for a modern nation-state that was drastically 
different from its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
During the Tokugawa period (1600-1868) the emperors played no significant 
political role. With the advent of modern Japan, the emperor suddenly emerged 
on the center stage of politics. 
</P>
<P>
Although much emphasis has been put on Japan's "opening" to the West, what is 
often forgotten about the emergence of its modern emperor system is an 
accompanying and equally drastic change that took place in the Japanese 
attitude toward other Asian countries -- an attitude that is frequently 
described as datsu-a nyu-oh, or "fleeing from Asia and entering Europe." Before 
the Meiji period it was customary to pay respect to visitors from the Asian 
continent and regard them as potential teachers. Since the new emperor system 
was fashioned after European monarchies, the modern Japanese nation was created 
with a view to reaching an equal and symmetrical relationship with the nations 
of the Western world. Asian countries were excluded from the group of nations 
with which Japan should have relationships of equal and reciprocal terms. 
</P>
<P>
It was around this time that the Japanese adapted to the developmental view of 
the world in which Asian countries were classified as underdeveloped so that 
the Japanese were justified in not treating them on equal terms. Thus the 
Japanese internalized the very logic of 19th-Century imperialism, which 
legitimated the colonization of non-Western peoples. The Japanese sense of 
superiority to other Asian peoples still lingers, and is no doubt rooted in 
this logic. Yet the Japanese were fully aware that they could also be 
victimized by Western imperialism. Hence, later, in justifying its own 
colonialist policies, the government resorted to an argument that Japan had to 
take care of Asian peoples in order to protect and liberate them from Western 
domination. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no national leader's life in modern history better illustrates the 
fateof such an imperialist argument than that of Emperor Hirohito. Since 
Japan's defeat in 1945, not only those in Japan but also those in former 
Japanese-occupied territories like Taiwan, Korea and other Asian countries have 
repeatedly asked about Hirohito's war responsibility. Particularly noteworthy 
are the claims made by the relatives of dead soldiers in former Japanese 
territories that the emperor should be responsible for the deaths of their 
fathers, brothers and sons who were made to fight against Western imperialism 
as the emperor's sekishi, or babies, despite the social discrimination to which 
they were subjected in the prewar Japanese empire. As those territories became 
independent and non-Japanese as a result of the collapse of the empire, the 
emperor seemed to evade their questioning on the grounds that no national 
leader is held responsible to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the emperor's war responsibility, Japan's rapport with 
countries in East Asia has been awkward, to say the least. One reason is that 
the emperor has never replied to the queries about his responsibility for the 
aggression and acts of destruction that were committed by his forces during 15 
years of war (1931-45). Since the Allied powers -- the United States in 
particular -- decided to overlook Hirohito's war responsibility out of 
political consideration, the emperor had remained silent about Japan's past 
relationships with Asian countries. Yet when he visited the United States he 
did "deplore" the mistakes that he and his subjects had made during the war, 
and he accepted certain reproach for the war when he traveled in Europe. But he 
avoided any situation in which he could have been confronted with the question 
of his war responsibility in the Asian context. By so doing he took the decided 
risk that other Asian peoples could interpret his silence as implying that 
Asians were not worth replying to. 
</P>
<P>
As Japan has grown more important in economic and international politics, many 
Asian countries have taken a much more friendly attitude toward the Japanese 
than immediately after the war. Some have openly sought Japanese economic and 
technological guidance. In response to this change of general political climate 
in East Asia, an increasing number of Japanese, including those of the Ministry 
of Education, have ventured to claim that there is no particular historical 
past that the Japanese should apologize for. They point out that although Japan 
was one of the colonialist powers, no other Western colonialist has publicly 
acknowledged its historical crime and apologized for it. 
</P>
<P>
It has also been argued that the war was fought between the nation-states, and 
that it was legitimate for any national leader to pursue the national interest 
by any means. Japanese leaders, including the emperor, did for his country what 
was expected of any good patriot. This logic continues to say that there has 
never been any judicial ground on which one could possibly judge the behavior 
of the nation-state. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 years, few believed that there would ever be any judicial grounds on 
which Hirohito could be prosecuted. But the point of asking about the war 
responsibility lies elsewhere. It is a way for those living in or concerned 
with Japan to maintain the possibility of criticizing the nation and to keep 
Japan aware that it must be receptive to criticism. Unless one is prepared to 
expose oneself to such criticism, which may be offensive on occasion, one 
cannot remain open to others or maintain a sense of responsibility. 
Unfortunately, there are signs that some people in Japan have become 
non-responsive and intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
In death, Hirohito has lost the opportunity to respond to queries about his 
responsibility and consequently his opportunity to be responsible. It is 
natural for Asian peoples not to be able to think of constructing relationships 
with Japan on the basis of fundamental trust, because trust is possible only 
between two parties that are responsive and responsible to one another. 
</P>
<P>
Will the people of Japan follow the example of their symbolic leader, thereby 
missing any chance of creating trustworthy relations with people in East Asia? 
I hope that Hirohito's death does not mark the closing of the Japanese mind, 
and that the new emperor will not mistake his father's death as a sign of this 
case being closed and the slate being clean.

MAKING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
NEUTRAL OUTSIDERS CAN EXERT POLITICAL, FINANCIAL LEVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The following commentary is excerpted from The Americas in 1989: Consensus 
for Action, a report issued in Washington today by the Inter-American Dialogue, 
a nonpartisan organization of 70 political, business, academic and religious 
leaders from throughout the hemisphere. The co-chairmen are Sol M. Linowitz, a 
Washington attorney, and Daniel Oduber, former president of Costa Rica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As 1989 begins, Central America is caught between the harsh reality of war and 
the lingering promise of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 200,000 people have been killed in the internal conflicts of El 
Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, and more than 2 million have been uprooted 
from their homes. Much of the region's physical infrastructure lies in ruins or 
disrepair. Hurricanes, drought and earthquakes have taken a heavy toll, but the 
worst destruction has been wreaked by war. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even as Central America's suffering continues, broad agreement has finally 
emerged on what must be done to end it. The blueprint exists in the Esquipulas 
accord -- the proposals put forward in 1987 by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of 
Costa Rica and adopted by the five Central American presidents when they met in 
Guatemala that August. But this blueprint will be useless unless there is a 
resolution of the confrontation between the governments of Nicaragua and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
At this juncture the prospects for peace between the United States and 
Nicaragua depend on Washington's first making clear its terms for restoring 
normal relations with the Sandinista government. If the new U.S. Administration 
and Congress believe that the very existence of the Sandinista regime in 
Managua, because of its character and ideology, threatens U.S. security 
interests, then the United States may see no long-term alternative to 
attempting to oust the Sandinista government, in the meantime continuing its 
unremitting hostility toward Nicaragua. Such an approach almost certainly would 
condemn Central America to many more years of confrontation, destruction and 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
We strongly urge a different tack. We do not believe that the Sandinista 
regime,by its mere existence, poses the kind of security threat that could 
justify direct or indirect military or paramilitary intervention by the United 
States. The emphasis of U.S. policy should be not on overthrowing the 
government of Nicaragua but on ensuring that its activities do not threaten the 
security of other countries. On this key point there is broad agreement both in 
Latin American and in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To deter any future threat to its security, the United States should obtain 
satisfactory assurances from the Soviet Union and Cuba that they will curtail 
their military ties to Nicaragua. The United States should also resume direct 
bilateral talks with the government of Nicaragua in order to fashion mutual 
security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
While negotiating on security issues, the U.S. government should continue 
trying to foster political competition in Nicaragua. By alleviating its 
security concerns, the United States should be able to concentrate more 
effectively -- in concert with other democratic countries -- on promoting 
pluralism and democracy everywhere in Central America. This aim is more likely 
to be achieved, over time, through internal pressure and consistent 
multilateral inducements rather than through unilateral imposition or 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Central America's security ultimately depends on fashioning internal agreements 
that allow all major groups to participate fully in political life and thereby 
acquire a stake in civic peace. That is why the Esquipulas peace process 
focuses on fostering national reconciliation and political pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
It is, however, much easier to profess a commitment to democracy than to carry 
it out. Most of Central America today is still a long way from political 
pluralism and constitutional democracy. Abuses of human rights and restrictions 
on open political activity are all too common in El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras and Nicaragua. In Guatemala, El Salvadorand Honduras, military and 
police forces ignore or resist civilian political authorities. In these three 
countries, institutions are weak and vulnerable to corruption. In Nicaragua, 
Sandinista Party control of the armed forces raises serious questions about the 
regime's willingness to accept autonomous opposition -- the basic prerequisite 
for peaceful political competition. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Central America's armed conflicts can soon be halted or sharply 
reduced, pluralist politics will take many years to build. These societies have 
become intensely polarized, and their deep divisions have to be healed. The 
rules of politics still have to be devised through broad consultation and 
agreed on by the main social actors. Civic trust must be earned reciprocally 
among the main contenders for power. 
</P>
<P>
A whole network of institutions must be built to make effective democracy 
possible. Independent judiciaries must be created; political parties, 
professional associations, interest groups and other nongovernmental 
organizations must be fostered and strengthened; the media must become more 
competent and professional and be allowed to provide information independent of 
the dictates of ruling groups, and civilian control of the armed forces must be 
firmly established. 
</P>
<P>
National reconciliation, combined with steady progress toward pluralism and 
democracy, is essential to achieve a lasting peace in Central America. The 
genius of Esquipulas was its marshaling of concerted, symmetric and reciprocal 
external pressures on Central America's countries to open up on competitive 
politics. Continuation of such pressure, accompanied by incentives, is much 
more likely than military action -- or mere exhortation -- to promote 
democracy. What is urgently needed now is a strategy for bringing international 
influence to bear more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend three concrete steps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- We urge the five presidents of Central America to request the United 
Nations or the Organization of American States to establish an independent 
international committee to evaluate compliance with the political provisions of 
Esquipulas. Such a body -- which might include Canada, Spain and West Germany, 
for example -- should be responsible for reporting on violations of human 
rights, monitoring freedom of assembly and expression, and observing political 
campaigns and elections. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the short-lived verification and follow-up commission established after 
Esquipulas, the new evaluation committee should be composed of a small number 
of countries accepted as impartial by the five Central American governments; it 
should have unimpeded access to all five nations, and should issue periodic 
public reports on progress toward achieving the Esquipulas commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- International pledges of significant economic assistance should be 
conditioned on good-faith efforts by the Central American governments to 
negotiate solutions to the armed conflicts as well as on their satisfactory 
implementation of the Esquipulas commitments regarding political pluralism and 
peaceful political competition. Until progress on both these dimensions has 
been achieved, international economic assistance should be limited to 
humanitarian relief for the victims of war. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The international community should organize a consultative group to 
mobilize resources in support of the Esquipulas process. Specifically, the 
group should coordinate economic development assistance, tying it tightly to 
each country's progress in implementing the Esquipulas provisions, as evaluated 
by the recommended independent body. Positive incentives and sanctions for 
non-compliance should be based on a reasonable timetable for progress toward 
pluralism and democracy, taking into account each country's circumstances.

A new record of pop, rock and jazz standards by former Beatle Paul McCartney, 
released exclusively in the Soviet Union, is fetching up to $250 a copy in the 
United States -- if fans can find one. Dealers say copies of the first edition 
of the album ("Back in the U.S.S.R."), released in November by the state-run 
Soviet label Melodiya, have all but vanished into Beatle heaven. The record was 
made with the understanding that it would not be exported out of the Soviet 
Union, and a first edition run of 50,000 copies sold out almost immediately in 
the Soviet Union at a cover price of 4 rubles ($6.60). McCartney, 46, made the 
record as a gesture of good will to the Soviet Union and its policy of 
glasnost, or openness. ALEENE MacMINN

Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is leaving London and moving 110 miles northwest to 
the industrial city of Birmingham. The lure: $10.6 million in extra funding. 
"The facilities to be built in Birmingham and the new money to be made 
available add up to an offer we cannot refuse," explains Jeremy Isaacs, 
director of the Royal Opera House. Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet is the touring 
section of the Royal Ballet and usually performs in London at Sadler's Wells 
Theater, while the Royal Ballet appears at the Royal Opera House, Covent 
Garden. ALEENE MacMINN

Motion Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti and a dozen other 
entertainment industry figures have been named to a new National Film 
Preservation Board. Created by Congress last year, the group each year will 
recommend to the Librarian of Congress as many as 25 "culturally significant" 
films for inclusion in the National Film Registry. The group can also demand 
that disclaimers be made if films have been colorized or "materially altered." 
Other members are Roddy McDowall of the Screen Actors Guild, George Kirgo of 
the Writers Guild of America, Franklin Schaffner of the Directors Guild of 
America and Fay Kanin of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. They 
will meet Jan. 25 in Washington. ALEENE MacMINN

When Johnny Carson was honored Sunday night at a celebrity-studded dinner to 
raise money for scholarships in his name to Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he 
noted that a large telescope was being built in Hawaii and said: "Even with 
that telescope, I still wouldn't be able to see why Hebrew University is 
honoring this Gentile." Jihan Sadat, the wife of slain Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat, praised Carson as "an American who is a household name throughout the 
world, a man who has humorously chided us for our shortcomings and brought 
laughter into our lives." ALEENE MacMINN

Four gunmen wounded one man and missed an infant by inches when they fired 
shots outside a home where a fight had erupted hours earlier during a birthday 
party, Santa Cruz police said. Witnesses told officers that four men pulled up 
in front of the house in a brown-paneled station wagon and began firing at 
three men standing in the driveway. A bullet grazed the back of Nickolas 
Decorse, 24, of Ft. Ord, and other bullets entered the house, nearly wounding 
an infant and two adults. Decorse's car was also struck. Police had been called 
to the house earlier to break up a fight, officers said.

An off-duty Fresno police officer spotted and captured a man wanted for two 
fatal stabbings in Fresno in 1982. The officer saw Robert Cedillo, 22, of 
Fresno walking near an intersection in the town of Clovis. The officer, with 
help from a Clovis officer, captured Cedillo without incident. Investigators 
said Cedillo had been sought since mid-1982 for the stabbing deaths of Armando 
Velez and his brother, Mario, in Fresno. Police said Cedillo was 16 at the 
time.

Photo, Hanging 10 on Banks of Snow It is called snowboarding and its adherents 
say that skateboarding skills, and perhaps some surfing abilities, are the keys 
to success. Skiing proficiency is the least important requirement, they say. 
These participants are trying out a new run on Snow Summit, near Big Bear, cut 
out exclusively for snowboarders. Called the Halfpipe, for its shape, it 
features high-banked turns that provide the thrills. After a run, riders hike 
back up for another go. TAMMY LECHNER / Los Angeles Times

VISTA MAN, 82, FOUND SLAIN AT CAMP PENDLETON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 82-year-old Vista man who was reported missing by his wife a week ago was 
found shot to death Sunday afternoon in a remote northern region of Camp 
Pendleton, the FBI reported. 
</P>
<P>
Swan Otto Bloomquist was found at 2:30 p.m. by two brothers, both civilians, 
who were out target practicing, said Ronald Orrantia, spokesman for the FBI's 
San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
"The brothers' dog picked up on the scent of the dead man," who was found 
northwest of Fallbrook, Orrantia said. "It appears to be a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Bloomquist died of multiple gunshot wounds, Deputy Coroner George Dickason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomquist was reported missing last Tuesday after he dropped his wife off at a 
Carlsbad mall. He said he would wait in the car while she shopped. She returned 
about an hour later but could not find him or the car. 
</P>
<P>
The car, a 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass with California license plates 2HMF549, has 
not been found. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was stolen when he was abducted," said Orrantia. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has no suspects in the slaying. It is investigating because the body 
was found on federal property.

FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP SEEKING TO DEFEAT KORENSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County-based fundamentalist group is seeking to defeat Los Angeles 
school board incumbent Julie Korenstein in the April election because of her 
support of counseling for gay and lesbian students and the dispensing of 
birth-control devices by two school health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coalition of Traditional Values is opposed to the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's Project 10, the gay counseling program, as well as 
the district's two school-based health clinics that, among other services, 
dispense birth-control devices and family-planning information, said Bill 
Jones, a spokesman for the group's Van Nuys office. Korenstein, along with the 
board majority, voted for both programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to that broad base of people who call themselves Christians," 
Jones said. "Homosexuality and abortion are the two biggest issues that we are 
most alarmed about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presidential Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Many members of the coalition, which recently opened the Van Nuys office, 
worked for the presidential campaign of Pat Robertson, support issues such as 
prayer in public schools and would like to see an end to legalized abortion, 
Jones said. The group's goal is to educate Christian voters about those issues 
and to encourage them to vote in local elections, such as the Los Angeles 
school board race, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Korenstein, East Valley incumbent Roberta Weintraub and West Los 
Angeles representative Alan Gershman are also seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein's primary challenger, Barbara Romey, said that she has spoken with 
members of the coalition and will seek their endorsement. "I believe that 
people want a return to traditional values," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Romey opposes the district's counseling program for teen-age homosexuals, as 
well as the district's two health clinics, including the one at San Fernando 
High School. She said she believes most West Valley voters are also opposed to 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said she has not spoken with representatives of the coalition but 
would not align herself with such a group. "My constituency would not support 
that type of philosophy; we are talking about a fundamentalist philosophy," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Korenstein's campaign managers, Barbara Grover, said the fundamentalist 
supporters of Robertson are seen by many Jewish voters as anti-Semitic. Grover 
said that support by the coalition would hurt instead of help a candidate in 
the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pass Out Information 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that the group hopes to pass out information about school board 
candidates to Valley voters through congregations such as the Church On the 
Way, a Four-Square church in Van Nuys with about 6,000 members, and Van Nuys 
First Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jess Moody, pastor of 8,000-member Van Nuys First Baptist, said that 
although he agrees with the aims of the coalition, he does not allow 
information regarding candidates to be circulated on church property. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition founder Louis Sheldon, an Anaheim minister and veteran campaigner 
against gay rights, last week lobbied unsuccessfully to stop policy changes in 
the state's teaching of science. Over the objections of Sheldon, the State 
Board of Education agreed to allow only the teaching of tested theories that 
explain natural phenomena and that are based on scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said he objected to the teaching of evolution as fact. Critics said 
that the previous state policy was ambiguous and that it was interpeted by some 
teachers to allow the teaching of creationism in science classes. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Sheldon has lectured against homosexuality and has sought 
unsuccessfully to prohibit a gay pride festival in Long Beach.

FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN KEYSOR JOINS RACE FOR L.A. COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A familiar face from San Fernando Valley politics has emerged in downtown Los 
Angeles as a long-shot challenger to veteran Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Keysor, a northeast Valley assemblyman from 1971 to 1978, was among seven 
people who filed papers by Saturday's deadline to oppose Lindsay in the April 
11 municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is he?" was Lindsay's reaction Monday. "He's got a constitutional right to 
run against me, and I got a constitutional right to slay him." 
</P>
<P>
After losing his 39th Assembly District seat to Republican J. Robert Hayes in 
1978, Keysor, a Democrat, ran unsuccessfully in 1981 for the northeast Valley's 
old 1st City Council District seat won by the late Howard Finn. He also lost a 
bid to become Los Angeles County assessor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Keysor, 61, is board chairman of the family-owned plastics firm Keysor-Century 
Corp. in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 88, was appointed to the council in 1963, becoming its first black 
member. He has easily won reelection ever since. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the ballot, candidates must collect 500 signatures and pay $300 
by Feb. 4. Candidates can avoid paying the fee by gathering 1,000 signatures.

As a boy I had a dream of being a doctor someday, but unfortunately my father

those days, right in the midst of the Depression, we didn't have all these 
scholarships and loans floating around, so I had to compromise and settle for 
something else. I majored in zoology with the hope that I would teach it in 
some university or maybe a museum curatorship. 
</P>
<P>
I got married while I was in the Army, and afterwards we moved out to 
California. I was going from one job to another, marking time, more or less 
looking for the right niche. At that time there was a great shortage of 
elementary school teachers, so I took a job at an elementary school. I taught 
there for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't see myself staying an elementary school teacher for the rest of my 
life, so I decided high school teaching is where the opportunities are. I took 
additional courses in the summer and at night until I got the equivalent of a 
math major and took the math exam, and came out No.1. I retired from Fairfax 
High School nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When I retired, I went immediately into nursing school at Los Angeles Valley 
College. That's a two-year course of training and a rather rigorous one. I was 
frankly a little bit shocked when I got my first textbook, 1,600-odd pages of 
newspaper-sized print. I thought: "Oh my gosh, I'm not trying to be a doctor, 
I'm trying to be a nurse. Do you really have to know all of that?" It was a lot 
of work, but it was worth it. I was almost 62 when I graduated. 
</P>
<P>
When I was still a nursing student, in supervised clinical practice, a patient 
turned on a call light, so I responded to see what she wanted. I walked into 
the room, and this woman was sitting in the bed, and she looked at me sort of 
nonplused. She didn't say anything for a while. When she finally got her 
speech, she said: "Wow, this is some hospital. I called for a nurse and I got a 
doctor." She saw a middle-aged man with a stethoscope sticking out of his 
pocket, and she drew her own conclusions. Happened many times, many times. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't really change careers. I merely shifted from nursing minds to nursing 
bodies. Patients don't want to be in the hospital, they don't want to be sick. 
With a few rare exceptions they want to get better, then get out of there and 
go back home. My patients are much more thankful, more grateful to me, than my 
students were. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing was the closest thing I could get to my original desire to be a 
physician. I was much too old for that, but not too old to be a nurse. I'm 
happy with the choice I made, and I get a lot of joy, a lot of satisfaction out 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
I have close contact with doctors, and I get to know them personally. They are 
human. They have their foibles, and they make mistakes too. One eye-opener was 
that the buck seems to stop at the nurse. If a doctor makes a mistake, the 
nurse is responsible for catching the error. 
</P>
<P>
I worked full-time as a nurse until I turned 65. If I had continued working 
full-time after age 65, my salary would have wiped out the Social Security 
benefit totally. It just irked me to forfeit a benefit to which I was entitled. 
I still enjoy nursing part-time. I'll just do less of it until I reach the 
magic age of 70 in October. Then I'll be free to work as much as I like. 
</P>
<P>
I'm convinced that keeping active in the sunset years of life is very effective 
in slowing down the aging process. I'm just not ready to sit back in a rocking 
chair and just watch the boob tube and drink beer and maybe go fishing now and 
then. As long as I'm strong and healthy and vigorous, I want to keep going at 
full speed.

San Diego State reserve guard Rodney Jones, who sprained his left foot and 
ankle against Utah Saturday, is expected to miss the Aztecs' home games this 
week against Texas El Paso and New Mexico, trainer Brian Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is averaging 3.1 points and 8.6 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Sam Johnson, also bothered by a sprained left ankle, is probable 
for Thursday's game against UTEP, Barry said.

With two victories last week against San Jose State and Fresno State, 
undefeated San Diego State improved three places to No. 12 in the Associated 
Press top 20 poll. SDSU (14-0, 5-0 in the Big West), No. 1 Auburn (15-0) and 
unranked La Salle (14-0) are the only remaining unbeaten teams in Division I.

OIL FUTURES PRICES SURGE TO HIGHEST LEVELS SINCE '87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil futures prices jumped Monday to their highest levels since November, 1987, 
pumped up by market speculation that OPEC nations would be able to keep a cap 
on their output. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they did not expect the spike in prices to have much effect on 
prices of home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasted for a considerable 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. 
crude oil, jumped 40 cents to settle at $18.88 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the near-month contract settled higher was Nov. 20, 1987, amid 
hostilities in the Persian Gulf in the Iran-Iraq war. It settled that day at 
$18.93. 
</P>
<P>
Although Persian Gulf troubles no longer are an issue, the price of the 
near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate has soared 50% since an 
intra-day low of $12.28 a barrel on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Momentum' Behind Increase 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increase is speculation that some kind of production 
agreement may be reached at a meeting beginning Jan. 26 in London between 
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC 
countries, according to Gene Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts said the latest surge seemed more the result of emotion 
than news. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we've got getting this market up is momentum. I'd have to list 
that as the first cause," said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy 
group at Elders Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no underlying structural reason. There's no shortage," said John 
Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Prices began rising in October on expectations that OPEC members would agree to 
cut production as a way of propping up prices. An agreement was reached in late 
November and took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said OPEC's production has been 19 million barrels a day or slightly 
more, above its self-imposed quota of 18.5 million barrels but well below 
December's actual production. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that many traders expect the surge in oil prices to be short-lived, 
prices for delivery in later months were significantly lower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Intra-Day High 
</P>
<P>
The March contract for West Texas Intermediate rose 27 cents to $17.95 a 
barrel; the April contract rose 21 cents to $17.37 a barrel, and the May 
contract rose 14 cents to $16.98 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Among refined products traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February 
contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.94 cent to 50.91 cents a gallon and the 
February contract for No. 2 heating oil rose 0.21 cent to 53.16 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The intra-day trading high -- the highest point reached during the trading 
session -- was $18.93 for the February contract for West Texas Intermediate. 
That topped the 1988 intra-day high of $18.92 on April 18, which also preceded 
a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, Beutel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where the Oil Is 
</P>
<P>
In related news, the Middle East Economic Survey said Monday that six members 
of OPEC now have 70.5% of the world's proven oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
The respected oil industry newsletter said revised estimates indicated reserves 
for those nations in the last five years has risen from 308 billion barrels to 
a total of 699 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
It listed Saudi Arabia with 255 billion barrels, Iraq with 100 billion, the 
United Arab Emirates with 98 billion, Kuwait with 95 billion, Iran with 93 
billion and Venezuela with 58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The five Persian Gulf states account for nearly two-thirds of the world's 
proven reserves.

PILOTS GROUP SAYS NORTHWEST AIRLINES LESS PROFITABLE SINCE REPUBLIC MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Northwest Airlines has done better than its competitors in limiting costs but 
has been less profitable since its 1986 merger with Republic Airlines, the Air 
Line Pilots Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest planes spent less time in the air and thus generated less revenue 
than those of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines from the 
beginning of 1986 through mid-1988, the association said in a study reported 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which represents 4,800 Northwest pilots, based its findings on 
an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation data. The pilots and Eagan, 
Minn.-based Northwest entered mediated bargaining in late 1988 after 19 months 
of negotiations failed to produce a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drag on Profits 
</P>
<P>
"We found not only was Northwest not making full use of its domestic resources, 
both planes and employees, but that this phenomenon was beginning to show up as 
a drag on the bottom line," said Pete Quortrup, a Northwest co-pilot and 
association spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest's domestic operating expenses increased by 5% from 1986 to 1988, the 
study said. Expenses increased at American and United during that period by 
18.8% and 15.5%, respectively, it said. 
</P>
<P>
But American's domestic operating revenues increased 29.1%, United's rose 27.4% 
and Delta's grew 17% during the period, while Northwest revenues were up only 
2.5%, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Profits for the period soared by 9,961.3% at American, 313.4% at Delta and 
93.9% at United. Northwest profits declined 39.7% during the 30-month period, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said, the number of hours flown daily by each American, Delta 
and United plane increased during the period and declined at Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 merger with Republic prompted Northwest to reduce service to many 
cities where both airlines had competed, Quortrup said. But Northwest left many 
newly available planes idle instead of assigning them to other routes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chairman Declined Interview 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier declined a request by The Detroit News 
to be interviewed about the pilots' study but gave written responses to several 
questions in a story published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rothmeier acknowledged that Northwest scaled back use of its domestic fleet 
during the first six months of 1988 "to get a better handle on customer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who flew Northwest in Detroit knew the problems we were having: poor 
on-time performance, baggage mishandling and other complaints, in large part 
all the result of inadequate airport facilities," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest also absorbed relatively high labor costs during the period, 
including a 14% pay raise for former Republic pilots.

NEW HAHN BUILDING AIMS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Ernest Hahn said he and his partner Harry Summers will begin 
construction "within two or three months" on what will be the tallest building 
in the Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
The project will commence despite the area's high office vacancy rate, which is 
likely to increase over the next year with the completion of half a dozen 
office buildings now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the planned 17-story, 325,000-square-foot building was estimated 
by Hahn at $80 million. The building will be the last of six buildings in the 
850,000-square-foot Plaza at La Jolla Village complex. No leases have been 
signed for the structure to be situated on La Jolla Village Drive across from 
University Towne Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
The office space vacancy rate in the mushrooming UTC area is now a high 25%, 
said Ron Miller, a marketing consultant at C. W. Clark/Rancon Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
Six buildings totaling more than 800,000 square feet of office space are under 
construction and scheduled to be completed over the next year, Miller said. 
Among those is the 225,000-square-foot Aventine building, scheduled to open by 
the end of 1989. The structure is part of a hotel and restaurant complex at 
Interstate 5 and La Jolla Village Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Also under way is the 225,000-square-foot La Jolla Executive Center, which is 
scheduled to open by September. A development of Alan I. Kay, the building is 
situated at La Jolla Village Drive and Genesee Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the high vacancy rates do not worry him because the Plaza at La Jolla 
Village has been able to lease a disproportionately large share of the office 
space in the area. Last year the Plaza accounted for 120,000 square feet of the 
250,000 square feet of offices leased in the area, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers are diverting their plans to other types of buildings, Miller 
said. The Lomas Santa Fe development firm, for example, is building a 
68,000-square-foot medical office building in its Regent's Square development 
on La Jolla Village Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The market should be good for the medical offices, since vacancy rates are now 
close to zero at "on-site" medical office buildings next to nearby Scripps 
Memorial, Scripps Clinic and Veterans Administration hospitals, Miller said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the market is experiencing the January effect -- by which small stocks 
rebound from late-year drops spurred by tax-loss selling -- or maybe it is 
moving contrary to the consensus of economists' forecasts, suggested Irving 
Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
But, for whatever reason, some San Diego stocks have done quite well during the 
first two weeks of the new year, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Five San Diego stocks have attained 52-week highs: 
</P>
<P>
* Cohu hit $13.25 after announcing it had joined a consortium of American 
companies working on a compatible high-definition television technology. 
</P>
<P>
* PS Group hit $34.375 after announcing that it was selling a substantial 
portion of its oil and gas properties. 
</P>
<P>
* Beeba's Creations rose to $10 in continued response to a profitable first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
* Pancretec, which was the largest percentage gainer of any San Diego stock in 
1988, added $1 to last year's closing price, making a new high of $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
* First National Corp., which closed 1988 at $10, made a new high of $11.75 
</P>
<P>
A good gain was also made by General Microelectronics, which closed 1988 at $2 
and has risen $.875 during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr Industries continued to move up and down on repeated merger and takeover 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller gains were made by Infrasonics, which gained $.375 after press reports 
of adverse effects bothering some competitors who also manufacture infant 
ventilators. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey Inc. gained $.25 as the company reported its largest backlog. 
</P>
<P>
BSD Bancorp likewise gained $.25. This undervalued stock continues to sell at 
two-thirds of book value. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, a 52-week low was recorded by Imperial Corp. America, at 
$7.50, in continued reaction to the announcement of $50 million in 
fourth-quarter write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co., which holds its annual meeting today in Phoenix, was down $1.50. 
Advanced Marketing Services, which supplies books to warehouse clubs, was down 
$1.75 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
For those investors still attempting to understand Henley Group, old Henley 
shareholders now own .225 shares of new Henley "A" stock -- which is selling at 
$70.25 -- and one share of Wheelabrator Group -- which closed Monday at $7.75.

RECORD PRICES PUT '88 AT DECADE HIGH FOR HOUSING SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both single-family houses and condominiums climbed to new record average prices 
in December as 1988 closed out as the best year of the decade for residential 
real estate sales, according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the average price of a single-family house was $280,200, up 5% 
from November's figure and 27% higher than the December, 1987, average price of 
$221,100. The previous record was $268,900 in October. 
</P>
<P>
The average price for condominiums inched up to $134,900 in December, an 
increase of less than 1% from November but it marks a 12% jump since December, 
1987, when the average condominium price was $120,100. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, the average price for a single-family house was $248,492, 
setting another record and up 22% from the 1987 average of $203,433. In all, 
15,263 houses were sold last year, a 15% increase from the 13,334 houses sold 
in 1987. The southeast area of the Valley was the hottest housing market, 
accounting for 25% of all houses sold during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condo Increases 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, condominium prices for the full year climbed a more modest 6%, with 
an average price of $127,017, compared to $119,733 in 1987. A total of 4,510 
condominiums were sold last year, up 42% from 1987. Again, the southeast was 
the busiest sales area, accounting for 28% of those condominiums sold in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It all added up to a record $4.4 billion worth of residential sales last year 
with a total of 19,714 houses and condominiums sold. It was the greatest number 
of sales in any year this decade, topped only by the 19,964 sales in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Link, the board's executive vice president, attributed the feverish climb 
in prices to the many homeowners who listed their homes for sale in hopes of 
trading up to bigger and better ones. Relatively low interest rates also helped 
fuel the sales increases. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, anyone who has owned a house in the area for several years is likely 
to be sitting on a sizable appreciation in the value of their property. Put 
another way, the $280,200 average single-family house price in December, 1988, 
marks an 87% jump from the December, 1984, average of $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and 
condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its 
statistics do not include most new residences, which are generally sold without 
a real estate agent, or existing houses that are resold by their owners.

DAMON ENDS FIGHT; OKS $223-MILLION TAKEOVER BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damon Corp. on Monday accepted a revised, $223-million takeover offer from a 
group led by American Magnetics Corp. in Sherman Oaks, apparently ending 
Damon's seven-month battle to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
However, the companies' agreement also allows Damon, a Needham Heights, 
Mass.-based operator of clinical laboratories, to solicit alternative offers 
for 30 days. Damon said it is continuing talks with an unidentified third party 
about a possible transaction, but said there is no assurance a deal will 
result. 
</P>
<P>
The American Magnetics group, called Nomad Partners, also includes Ballantrae 
Partners, an investment partnership led by Robert L. Rosen and Glen M. Kassan, 
chairman and executive vice president of American Magnetics, respectively. The 
pair own a combined 14% of American Magnetics, and both also formerly worked 
for Maxxam Group, a Los Angeles company headed by takeover specialist Charles 
E. Hurwitz. 
</P>
<P>
American Magnetics makes "optical-character recognition" equipment, the 
machines used to scan credit-card data at store checkout counters, and the 
devices inside automated bank-teller machines that read customers' bank cards. 
The company, with plants in Carson and Torrance, earned $353,000 on sales of 
$11.8 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approved by Directors 
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement with Nomad, which already owns 1.03 million, or 11%, of 
Damon's 9.6-million total common shares outstanding, was approved by Damon's 
directors but remains subject to approval by its stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Nomad would pay $26 in cash for each of the Damon shares 
it does not already own. Damon shareholders also would get 50% of any after-tax 
cash from the sale of Damon's 61% ownership of Damon Biotech, a biotechnology 
company that is publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old biotechnology venture has been a drain on Damon's profits, and 
Damon had previously proposed spinning off the unit to its shareholders. But 
the company said Monday that there would be no such spinoff if the Nomad merger 
goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Nomad also had promised to shed Damon Biotech, and its previous offer to buy 
Damon had called for Damon's stockholders to receive $24 in cash and 1.3 shares 
of Damon's interest in Damon Biotech for each of their existing shares. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street, meanwhile, gave the merger pact a lukewarm response. Damon's stock 
closed Monday at $24.625 a share, down 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock 
Exchange. In over-the-counter trading, American Magnetics closed at $4.125 a 
share, unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Nomad began pursuing Damon last June and, after its initial overtures were 
rebuffed, it launched a hostile $24-a-share tender offer for the remaining 
Damon stock. Damon rejected the offer as inadequate and proposed spinning off 
its interest in Damon Biotech. 
</P>
<P>
Damon operates 12 clinical laboratories, which analyze such things as blood and 
urine samples, and also manufacturers and sells laboratory equipment and 
diagnostic instruments. In the past three years, Damon has received $25 million 
in contracts from the U.S. military to test for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, making it one of the nation's largest testers for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The company is the one of the largest independent laboratory chains, but also 
one of the last. Most of the remaining independents have been bought in recent 
years by huge drug companies, such as SmithKline Beckman Corp., or 
medical-products concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Damon also makes school and hobby products, and is one of the biggest U.S. 
builders of model rockets and kites. In its fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1988, 
Damon earned $8.2 million on revenue of $208.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Damon purchase is the latest in a string of diversification moves 
that Rosen has attempted since he took the helm of American Magnetics in 1987. 
A year ago, he was outbid for DuroText Corp., a New Jersey light-bulb maker, 
and in April, 1988, American Magnetics bought a shopping center in Florida for 
$12.4 million.

12% OFFICE VACANCY RATE IN QUARTER MATCHES 5-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley office vacancy rate dropped to 12% in the fourth 
quarter of 1988, as low as it has been in the past five years, according to the 
realty firm Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, for the same period, the office vacancy rate was 16% in downtown 
Los Angeles and 13% in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley survey covers the area from Newbury Park to Burbank. In the fourth 
quarter, there was 2.2 million square feet of vacant office space out of an 
inventory of 18.3 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
According to Grubb &amp; Ellis, building restrictions along Ventura Boulevard 
and the relatively small amount of new space being added make it likely that 
the rental market will remain tight this year. The survey said 9% of the 2.3 
million square feet of office space under construction is already leased. 
</P>
<P>
The East Valley market, which includes Burbank and Studio City, as usual posted 
the lowest vacancy rate, with 6%. Michael Howard, a senior marketing consultant 
with Grubb &amp; Ellis, said he expects that area to pull in the Valley's 
highest rental rates because of its entertainment industry tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The highest vacancy rate, at 17.5%, was in the so-called "Technology Corridor," 
which includes Thousand Oaks and Calabasas. The area offers lower rents than 
the rest of the Valley, and builders continue to put up offices in the hope 
that slow-growth movements elsewhere will force businesses to move farther 
west. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the central Valley, which includes Encino and Van Nuys, 
posted a 15% vacancy rate. The rate for the West Valley, which includes Tarzana 
and Woodland Hills, was 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents said landlords no longer have to give as many concessions to 
sign tenants. Not long ago, landlords often had to give away one year's free 
rent on a 10-year lease. Agents say eight free months is now the norm.

BUSH VOWS TO PURSUE KING DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
'WE MUST NOT FAIL,' HE SAYS ON HOLIDAY FOR RIGHTS LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Bush pledged Monday at a prayer breakfast honoring Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. that the slain civil rights leader's "fight for equality, 
justice, freedom and peace will indeed be still pursued in the years to come 
and forevermore." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the unifying theme that he has adopted as he nears his decade-long 
goal of the presidency, Bush's speech demonstrated a different tone on racial 
issues than that of President Reagan, who is ending his term on a rough-edged 
note over race relations. Bush emphasized that he has learned the lessons of 
King -- and will follow them as President -- and that the nation must do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"What becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us," Bush said. "We must 
not fail him. We must not fail ourselves. And we must not fail the nation he 
loved so much and gave his life for. I understand that -- five days before 
becoming President of the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
On his final weekend in office, Reagan -- who objected to the creation of a 
federal holiday to honor King -- kicked up a small storm when he questioned the 
motives of today's civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wonder if they really want what they say they want, because some 
of those leaders are doing very well leading organizations based on keeping 
alive the feeling that they're victims of prejudice," Reagan said in an 
interview on the CBS-TV program "60 Minutes" that was broadcast Sunday. Among 
others, the Rev. Jesse Jackson criticized the remark, saying the President "may 
be the worst civil rights President we've had in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focused on Segregation 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no reference to Reagan's remarks, focusing on the years of 
segregation and the need to follow the direction King set rather than 
delivering an assessment of the current state of racial relations in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
After running an election campaign that some said drew on racial fears by 
emphasizing prison furloughs and crime, Bush has taken pains in the weeks 
leading up to his inauguration Friday to reach out to varied groups of 
Americans and to build on his theme of creating a "kinder, gentler" America. He 
is also seeking to expand the number of blacks and other minorities, as well as 
women, in senior jobs, after representation of blacks in the upper reaches of 
government dropped sharply from the Jimmy Carter Administration to that of 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the blacks set to join the Administration are Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, 
chosen to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and 
Frederick McClure, a vice president of Texas Air Corp. who will be assistant to 
the President for legislative affairs -- Bush's chief representative to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
McClure joined Bush on the dais at a Washington hotel Monday morning for the 
prayer breakfast of the Bush inauguration's Afro-American Committee to read the 
White House proclamation declaring Monday a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who won about 12% of the black votes cast in the November election, drew 
a portrait of King that avoided the suggestion made by Reagan in 1983 that a 
review of FBI files might show that King was a communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
King, who was assassinated in 1968, "lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's 
dreams. And he left a hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a 
great nation," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights leader, who would have been 60 years old Sunday, "destroyed 
segregation, transformed a nation's history, restored a nation's value, 
restored a nation's virtue and realized a great people's noblest promise." 
</P>
<P>
Bush continued: 
</P>
<P>
"We resolve today, on this holiday and in this inaugural week, that our nation, 
our America, will indeed remember Martin Luther King Jr.; that his fight for 
equality, justice, freedom and peace will indeed be still pursued in the years 
to come and forevermore; that bigotry and indifference to disadvantage will 
find no safe home on our shores, in our public life, in our neighborhoods or in 
our home. 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. King's dream for his children and for ours will be fulfilled. This must 
be our mission together. It will, I promise, be my mission as President of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent most of Monday, a national holiday, at his home. With selections for 
the most senior positions in his government completed, Bush's next major goal 
is completion of his inaugural address and the filling of secondary, but still 
senior, positions in the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared to have settled on Donald J. Atwood Jr., vice chairman of General 
Motors Corp. who has overseen the company's defense business, as deputy 
secretary of defense -- a position that Bush and his advisers want to fill with 
a strong manager able to tame the Pentagon's procurement jungle -- and was said 
to be ready to name officials for several non-Cabinet federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Because movers had begun to empty the vice presidential mansion for the move to 
the White House, Bush was forced to work on the inaugural address on makeshift 
furniture. "He's working on a card table now," one aide said.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Friday's inauguration approaches, Barbara Bush has almost single-handedly 
packed all the boxes of belongings in the rambling Victorian mansion that 
serves as the vice presidential residence. She has marked each with a colored 
dot -- red to the White House, yellow to the presidential retreat at Camp 
David, Md., and blue to the family home at Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, as part of the tightest security preparations for any public 
event in the nation's history, welders were sealing manhole covers on 
Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday to prevent terrorists from popping up in the 
middle of the inaugural parade. 
</P>
<P>
And at the Washington Convention Center, where two of nine inaugural balls will 
take place, Kevin Moley was planning the installation of luminous ceiling 
sculptures meant to symbolize the Bush campaign theme of "a thousand points of 
light." In all, $25-million worth of parties -- including one on Saturday 
dubbed "From George to George" (Washington to Bush) -- are ready. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Steps of Capitol 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a 200-year-old tradition, the city named after the first President 
is all set to inaugurate and celebrate the reign of the 41st. Before a live 
audience of 140,000 and millions more watching on television, George Herbert 
Walker Bush and James Danforth Quayle will be sworn in as President and vice 
president of the United States at noon Friday on the west steps of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
That is, unless the weather votes otherwise. Four years ago, snow and arctic 
cold forced the oath-taking ceremony for President Reagan and Vice President 
Bush indoors, under the Capitol dome, and the parade was canceled. The early 
forecast for Friday is for a high temperature in the mid-40s and precipitation 
no heavier than a few Democratic tears. 
</P>
<P>
The whirlwind of celebratory bashes this week will present a paradox. Tickets 
to many events will be the most expensive in history, ranging up to $25,000 for 
an eight-person box at Thursday's gala, to be televised live by CBS, featuring 
such entertainers as Julio Iglesias, Roberta Peters, Frank Sinatra, the Oak 
Ridge Boys and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Free Events 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there will be more free events than ever, including a forum 
Thursday at which "heroes from all walks of life" will tell young people about 
the "tremendous opportunities" awaiting them. 
</P>
<P>
The committee planning the privately financed balls, galas, pageants, salutes, 
dinners, forums and parade has budgeted a record $25 million, to be raised 
through a combination of interest-free loans and contributions from 
corporations and rich individuals as well as sales of tickets, memorabilia and 
television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of inflation and the increased free events, that is far more 
than the $4.5 million spent on Jimmy Carter's inaugural celebration in 1977 or 
even the much-criticized $16.3 million lavished on Reagan's first inauguration 
in 1981. (The 1985 price tag was scaled back to $9.5 million.) 
</P>
<P>
An additional $5 million in taxpayer funds will be spent this year on such 
things as security and platform construction at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is not being spent for gold and glitter but for substantive kinds of 
things," insists Stephen M. Studdert, executive director of the inaugural 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The festivities, says Penne Percy Korth, an art dealer who serves as committee 
co-chairman, are meant to "demonstrate to the world the beauty and uniqueness 
of an orderly, peaceful system that has operated successfully for 200 years." 
</P>
<P>
Inaugural extravaganzas have come a long way since George Washington, who took 
the oath of office in New York in 1789, watched a nighttime fireworks display 
from a friend's house and walked home through crowded streets. 
</P>
<P>
When John Adams succeeded Washington eight years later, there was a ball that 
evening, but it was for the retiring President, and no one thought to invite 
Adams, a political rival. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jackson, the hero of the common man, threw open the doors of the White 
House during his 1829 inauguration -- and thousands of celebrants descended on 
the mansion, stepping with muddy boots on damask-covered chairs and knocking 
over furniture and glassware to get at barrels of orange punch, ice cream and 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that fiasco, the Bushes are reviving Jackson's idea, opening the White 
House to all comers for three hours on Saturday morning. The newly moved-in 
hosts plan to greet many of the visitors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tight Security 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting concern over a worldwide epidemic of terrorism, extraordinary 
security measures have been taken for the string of inaugural events. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent an airborne attack at the inauguration, a sentry armed with a 
Stinger anti-aircraft missile will be stationed atop a building on the Capitol 
grounds, sources said. Sharpshooters will peer down from the Capitol roof as 
Bush takes the oath and gives his speech behind bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the tens of thousands of people attending the ceremony will have to 
pass through metal detectors at just four openings in miles of snow fencing 
that surround the grounds. Television operations with bulky equipment have been 
warned to show up well before dawn so that bomb-sniffing dogs and security 
personnel can go through their gear. 
</P>
<P>
Along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House, mailboxes, litter 
cans and newspaper vending machines will be removed to prevent the placement of 
time bombs. Buildings will be marked with large numbers so that roving SWAT 
teams can be directed quickly to any trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 federal workers will be given the day off, at a cost to the 
government of $40 million, to permit office buildings to be closed along the 
route and to ease traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes are not expected to follow the example of Jimmy Carter and his wife, 
Rosalynn, who took a surprise stroll down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue 
after his inauguration in 1977. Instead, they plan to ride from the Capitol to 
the parade reviewing stand at the White House in a new $600,000 armored Lincoln 
limousine that took three years to build. 
</P>
<P>
In line with past practice dating to Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration in 1964, 
the Bush inaugural committee raised $20 million in start-up money for the 
parade and private events by borrowing $100,000 interest-free from each of 200 
corporations and wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The loans will be repaid from corporate sponsorship of free events and from 
sales of tickets, television advertising and memorabilia ranging in price from 
$25 belt buckles to $1,195 crystal eagles. 
</P>
<P>
For Thursday night's gala, to be televised live on CBS, 14 minutes of 
commercials have been sold for $350,000 a minute, about one-quarter the price 
for Super Bowl air time. 
</P>
<P>
Executive director Studdert dismissed suggestions that the many generous 
financial supporters of the inaugural events might seek return favors when they 
have business before the new Administration. "There's no linkage at all," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This year's inaugural parade probably will not be able to compete with some of 
its predecessors for colorful participants and humorous moments. Buffalo Bill 
rode in Benjamin Harrison's 1889 parade and Indian chief Geronimo rode in 
Theodore Roosevelt's in 1901. In 1957, a horseman playfully threw a lasso over 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who as a West Point cadet 40 years earlier had 
marched in Woodrow Wilson's parade. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's parade will feature at least one first: politically significant 
police officers. At a cost of $75,000, the inaugural committee is bringing to 
Washington by train police officers from Boston, Springfield, Mass., and New 
York City who supplied key endorsements in Bush's presidential campaign against 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way where George Bush can clearly send a message that he has a very 
strong posture toward law and order," Studdert said. "Second, it's a way to say 
thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing in this year's parade, amid some lighthearted controversy, will 
be the California Raisins, a group of promotional dancers usually seen on 
television dressed up as dried grapes. When a last-minute scheduling change 
forced Bush, who had been in the area earlier, to cancel a rally last year in 
Fresno, home of the California Raisin Advisory Board, he joked: "I didn't want 
to see those damned dancing raisins again." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a good-will gesture, the raisins were invited to march in the 
inaugural parade. They declined at first, saying their 18-inch sneakers were 
not meant for walking, but then agreed to ride on a float sponsored by the 
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 214 bands, equestrian teams, choral groups or other units will be 
represented in the 1.6-mile parade, and every state and territory except North 
Dakota will have an entry. North Dakota's "centennial band" came up $80,000 
short in travel money and opted instead to go to the Rose Bowl Parade in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
California's entry will be the Sacramento County Mounted Posse, which appeared 
in Reagan's first inaugural parade in 1981 and was in Washington for the 1985 
parade before it was canceled by the cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most intensive inaugural planning has gone into avoiding a repeat 
of the Great Fur Flap of 1985, when hundreds of ballgoers wound up with someone 
else's fur coat -- or none at all -- because of a gigantic coat-check mix-up at 
the Washington Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
California firms making interest-free loans to the inaugural committee include 
Atlantic Richfield Co., Bank of America, Chevron Corp., Fluor Corp., Frederick 
Weisman Co., Pacific Telesis Group, Sun Diamond Growers of California and 
Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
Individual lenders from California include Donald L. Bren, chairman of Irvine 
Co.; Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; actor Glen 
Holden; Gordon C. Luce, chairman of Great American First Savings Bank of San 
Diego; David H. Murdock, Los Angeles real estate developer; Gerald L. Parsky, a 
Los Angeles attorney and former official in the Gerald R. Ford Administration; 
Jerry Weintraub, movie producer and close friend of the Bushes, and Earle C. 
Williams, a Los Angeles businessman.

GAS EXPLOSION INJURES 10 
</P>

Leaking propane gas exploded in a house in the tiny Tulare County community of 
Lindcove. All 10 people in the house, five adults and five children, suffered 
burns. Mary Estrella, 30, and her year-old son suffered second- and 
third-degree burns and smoke inhalation and were in stable condition at Valley 
Medical Center in Fresno. The other eight were treated for minor burns at 
various hospitals in Tulare County and were released, fire officials said. 
Investigators said it appeared that a pipe leading from a propane tank to the 
water heater was leaking and that the gas exploded when one of the adults lit a 
match in an effort to light the water heater pilot light. The explosion and 
fire destroyed most of the house and contents, with damage estimated at 
$25,000.

The body of a U.S. pilot killed in the April, 1986, bombing of Libya was 
returned to American soil in a solemn ceremony attended by relatives. The body 
of Air Force Maj. Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci of Utuado, Puerto Rico, was flown 
from Torrejon Air Base in Spain to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. An honor 
guard carried the flag-draped military coffin off the gray and white C-141 
airplane. The body will receive final preparations at the base mortuary before 
being turned over to the family for burial. Greeting the airplane were several 
members of Ribas-Dominicci's family, including his wife and son. Libya said it 
released the remains as a "humanitarian initiative." But Salvador 
Ribas-Dominicci said he is "angry" with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi for 
the delay in the release of his brother's body.

State Health Department workers plan to visit every house in the Kern County 
farming community of McFarland in the next several weeks as part of a program 
to evaluate the health of all children up to the age of 12 in the town of 
6,500. Residents with preteen children will be encouraged to make appointments 
at the town's new health clinic. The screening is being done because of the 
unusually high childhood cancer rate in McFarland. State and Kern County health 
officials have not been able to determine the cause of the cancer cluster. At 
least 15 McFarland children have been diagnosed as having cancer in the last 15 
years.

A judge ordered 46 leaders of Mexico's oil workers union to stand trial on 
charges of arms smuggling and corruption, and a union official said that arrest 
warrants have been issued for as many as 35 others in a further crackdown on 
the powerful labor organization. Police last week arrested the 46, including 
union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, in a move to abolish graft in the top 
ranks of the union. Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco denied bail to 18 of the 46 
and postponed bail hearings for Hernandez Galicia and three others until later 
this week. Union attorney Carlos Castro Esparza said he expects additional 
arrests soon as new warrants are served.

A Soviet ship left Luanda, Angola, with 975 Cuban troops, completing the 
first-stage withdrawal of 3,000 troops from Angola well ahead of the April 1 
deadline set by a regional agreement, the Portuguese news agency LUSA reported 
in a dispatch from Luanda. Under the accord signed last month by Cuba, Angola 
and South Africa, Cuba agreed to withdraw all its 50,000 troops from the 
southern African nation by July 1, 1991. The troops have been aiding the 
Marxist Angolan government in its war against rebels backed by the United 
States and South Africa.

Britain's Court of Appeal was ordered to review the convictions of four alleged 
Irish Republican Army guerrillas jailed 14 years ago for bombings of pubs. Home 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said he is reopening the case after a campaign supported 
by church leaders, former Cabinet ministers and two senior judges who said new 
evidence showed the four may be innocent. The four, Carole Richardson, Paddy 
Armstrong, Paul Hill and Gerard Conlon, are serving life sentences for the 
murder of five people killed when two pubs were bombed in Guildford near London 
in 1974. They were found guilty on the strength of confessions to police that 
they claimed were extracted under duress and that were retracted at their 
trial.

Businesses and residents have filed $1.1 million in damage claims against the 
federal government from fires that raged through Yellowstone National Park and 
surrounding forests last summer, forest officials say. U.S. Forest Service 
officials are processing the more than two dozen claims, which will be passed 
on to the U.S. General Counsel's Office, said Arlene Bateman, who is handling 
claims filed through the Forest Service's Region II office in Missoula, Mont. 
Government attorneys will review each claim to determine whether negligence or 
nature caused the damage, Bateman said. The Forest Service's policy to allow 
fires started by nature to burn unless they threatened lives, property or 
historic sites generated enormous controversy that has still not been resolved.

More than half of all professional baseball players participating in a

half of those who do use it regularly have abnormalities in their mouths that 
could eventually lead to cancer, UC San Francisco researchers said here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers surveyed and examined 1,109 major and minor league players from 
seven big league organizations -- including the California Angels, the San 
Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics -- last March during their spring 
training season. 
</P>
<P>
Of the players examined, epidemiologist Virginia L. Ernster told a meeting of 
the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, 39% had used smokeless 
tobacco within the previous week and 4% within the previous month. Another 13% 
were former users. 
</P>
<P>
The smokeless tobacco of choice for 75% of those who used it was snuff, which 
has been closely linked to oral cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The only good news in the study, Ernster said, was that few of the players 
smoked, and none of the lesions had yet turned cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, "this terrific group of role models for young men" are setting a 
disappointing example and endangering their own health at the same time, she 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Chewing tobacco is made up of loose leaves or a plug of tobacco that is 
inserted in the jaw and chewed regularly, with the released juices being spit 
out. Snuff is powdered or finely ground tobacco that is held between the teeth 
and gums and whose use is imperceptible until it is time to spit. Their use is 
widely considered to be a growing problem in the United States among youths who 
mistakenly believe that it is safer than smoking. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that 25% of all 
males aged 12 to 25 had used smokeless tobacco at some time, contrasted with 
only 9% of males over the age of 35. An estimated 8.2% of males aged 17-19 and 
5.9% of those aged 20 to 25 use smokeless tobacco regularly, contrasted with 
only 2% over age 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that only old men used smokeless tobacco," Ernster said. 
"Something has turned the demographics upside down." 
</P>
<P>
One contributor to the increased use among young people, she added, is the 
example set by celebrities, such as baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 1% of women use smokeless tobacco, mostly American Indians and native 
Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
Smokeless tobacco, particularly snuff, has been associated with a variety of 
lesions in the mouth, including leukoplakia (white and red patches), gum 
irritation and recession and staining of the teeth. Long-term use has been 
firmly linked to development of oral cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, researchers suspect that smokeless tobacco may alter blood 
pressure, heart rate and total cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart 
disease. The key ingredient that is linked to these problems, as is the case in 
smoking, is nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted in Arizona, where the seven major league teams in the 
spring training "Cactus League" and their 35 affiliated minor league teams 
practice. About 81% of the subjects were between the ages of 20 and 29 and 68% 
were Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
In their study, Ernster and her associates administered a four-page 
questionnaire to each of the participants about their smoking, chewing and 
alcohol use; checked their overall health, and gave them each a comprehensive 
examination of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
They found that 87% of the players had never smoked and that only 4% now 
smoked. About 46% of the Anglo players were now using smokeless tobacco, more 
than twice the percentage among minority groups, reflecting use patterns that 
exist in the population as a whole. They also found that those who used 
smokeless tobacco most frequently were also the individuals who drank the 
heaviest, averaging more than two drinks a day. 
</P>
<P>
Among the players who used smokeless tobacco regularly, 46% had lesions in 
their mouths, contrasted with 1.8% of those who never used smokeless tobacco. 
Most of the lesions cause pain or a burning sensation when they come in contact 
with food or other products, according to Sol Silverman Jr., professor of oral 
medicine at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Such lesions can turn cancerous among individuals who have used smokeless 
tobacco for decades, Silverman said. Biopsies of 91 of the lesions, however, 
showed that all were benign. 
</P>
<P>
In a few cases where biopsies were delayed for several days, Ernster noted, the 
lesions had disappeared because the players had been frightened out of using 
snuff. Their disappearance suggested that most of the lesions were not yet 
serious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The UC San Francisco team will examine the same players and any newcomers at 
spring training this year and in 1990. They hope to continue following some of 
the players after that to obtain long-term information about the health risks.

HOSTILITY SEEN AS 'TOXIC CORE' IN BEHAVIOR OF TYPE A PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cynicism, mistrust and anger toward others are "the toxic core" of Type A 
behavior -- the precise forms of hostility that place many workaholics at 
increased risk of heart disease and early death, new research suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted at Duke University and discussed Monday at an American 
Heart Assn. forum here, found that lawyers who fit a broad definition of 
hostility while they were in law school were more than four times more likely 
than others to die during the ensuing 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
At especially high risk were those inclined to harbor a cynical mistrust of the 
motives of others, and who openly and frequently expressed their anger: Their 
death rate over the 25-year period was 5 1/2 times as high as that of more 
trusting attorneys in the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Trusting hearts last longer," concluded Dr. Redford B. Williams Jr., a 
professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. 
Williams said his research is helping to "refine" the long-controversial 
hypothesis that ambitious, impatient, Type A people are more prone than others 
to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also offered a theory to explain that link. He suggested that hostile, 
Type A people may be endowed with a weak parasympathetic branch of the 
autonomic nervous system -- the branch responsible for exerting a calming 
effect after the "fight or flight" response triggered in people faced with 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study of the effects of a drug that stimulates the fight-or-flight 
response, Williams said the calming, parasympathetic branch seemed to kick in 
sooner in Type B men. That study and others suggest that the fight-or-flight 
response is blunted more quickly in non-hostile, Type B men than in Type A men, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Type A hypothesis emerged during the 1960s and '70s as a result of a 
long-range study that found impatient, ambitious and hostile men were twice as 
likely as their more easygoing counterparts to suffer some form of coronary 
disease. Those conditions included the blocked coronary arteries that lead to 
heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But more recent studies have challenged those findings, suggesting the link 
between personality and health is more subtle and complex. In recent years, 
researchers have focused on hostility as perhaps the most pernicious quality in 
Type A behavior. The findings presented Monday point to the specific aspects of 
hostility that are most harmful. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent study, to be published this spring, Williams studied 118 
lawyers who had undergone psychological testing in law school. Twenty-five 
years later, the death rate among those with high "hostility scores" was 4.2 
times higher than the rate among the others. 
</P>
<P>
The rate was even higher among those who were especially cynical and 
mistrustful -- the type of people, Williams said, inclined to blow up over slow 
elevators and long lines at banks and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about attitudes and beliefs," Williams said. He said such people 
think the worst of others. For example, they think to themselves, "Someone's 
holding up the elevator. Why don't the people in the bank line have their 
checks ready?" 
</P>
<P>
Williams' findings drew a cool response Monday from Dr. Meyer Friedman, one of 
the two San Francisco cardiologists who first developed the Type A theory in 
the 1960s. While Friedman said he agrees that hostility is a component of Type 
A behavior, he said "a sense of time urgency" is equally important. 
</P>
<P>
"The countries that are fighting (the pressures of) time are the countries that 
are fighting heart disease," Friedman said in a telephone interview. He noted 
that while there is much hostility in prison systems, there is no sense of time 
urgency and therefore no increased rate of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, now medical director of the Meyer Friedman Institute at Mt. Zion 
Hospital and Medical Center in San Francisco, also challenged Williams' 
emphasis on cynicism. He said he believes that inadequate self-esteem and 
insecurity are more significant personality characteristics leading to 
increased heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Examining the biology underlying such reactions, Williams said he has found 
that Type A men asked to perform mental arithmetic in a competitive setting -- 
and offered a prize for the fastest results -- show a more marked 
fight-or-flight response. That response was examined by measuring blood 
pressure, heart rate and muscle blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
They also experienced greater response to the stress hormone cortisol, Williams 
said. That hormone prolongs the effects of the emergency response, stimulating 
the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, commonly known as adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
All this may play a role in increasing coronary risk, Williams said. For 
example, large increases in the body chemicals, such as cortisol, involved in 
the stress response may contribute to changes in the lining of arteries that 
lead to arteriosclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wanted to do something about this, we should do something to reduce 
hostility, increase trust and reduce aggression toward others," Williams said. 
He said there is some preliminary evidence that such behavior modification 
might in the long run reduce the risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Williams himself recommends a series of steps, including monitoring one's 
cynical thoughts, in order to begin to control them and learning both to laugh 
at oneself and to be assertive in those instances in which one is genuinely 
being mistreated.

ONE OF 2 JUDGES LINKED TO COURT PROBE TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Orange County Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter, who faces formal hearings by the 
state Commission on Judicial Review on allegations that he improperly used his 
seat on the bench to help friends and gain favors with prostitutes, will resign 
next month, it was learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's intention to resign was announced by Harbor Judicial District 
Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom, who until two weeks ago was the presiding 
judge of the Newport Beach-based court. 
</P>
<P>
The judicial commission in October announced that it would hold formal hearings 
on both Carter and a close colleague on the Harbor bench, Calvin P. Schmidt, 
who has been under investigation for similar accusations. 
</P>
<P>
If Carter does resign, the matter of a hearing would be a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 62, was first investigated by the Newport Beach Police Department and 
the Orange County district attorney's office in 1984, when he was overheard on 
a tape-recorded conversation arranging a rendezvous for "love and friendship" 
with a prostitute who was seeking his help after an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In another taped conversation, when a former client and golfing partner sought 
Carter's help in getting him out of jail, the judge agreed to help the man, but 
was heard to say that what he was doing was "highly unethical." 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom said Carter did not give a reason for his resignation, which Carter 
said would be effective Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's wife Monday night said the judge was asleep and could not come to the 
phone. She had no comment on questions about her husband's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's attorney, Byron K. McMillan, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors had been heard throughout Orange County courts Friday that Carter's 
resignation was imminent. But that afternoon, Carter vehemently denied he had 
any plans to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the district attorney's office began looking into Carter's activities 
after a prostitute, Della Christine Johnson, told Fullerton police after she 
was arrested by them that she knew Carter. 
</P>
<P>
In statements presented in court papers, Johnson claimed that she had been told 
that Schmidt would fix a traffic ticket for her in exchange for sex, and that 
she agreed. But when it came time for the payoff to the judge, she said, Carter 
called her and said he was going to collect on behalf of Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt has refused to make any comment about these allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office then made arrangements for Johnson to call 
Carter and tell him about her arrest. After seeking his help, Carter asked her: 
</P>
<P>
"You got some . . . you got some time to spend with me?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: "Oh, sure." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said a few minutes later: "OK. Well, tomorrow is what? Tomorrow is love 
and friendship, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found Carter near Johnson's apartment the next day, but by then 
the prostitute had decided not to cooperate further with police. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been announced for the judicial commission hearing.

MIAMI REACTS WITH CHARITY AND ANXIETY TO LATEST REFUGEE INFLUX FROM NICARAGUA

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governments rise and governments fall, and this is where the losing side so 
often starts over. Se habla espanol in Miami, and most everyone has a cousin 
here with a spare bed. The rich quickly buy a condo on the water, and the poor 
talk their dreams to sleep under the shade of a palm. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the Cubans, who have arrived in trickles, spurts and one great gush of 
125,000 -- the ragtag Mariel armada of 1980. This city thought it finally had 
absorbed them all, when this year began instead with a new flood of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, busloads of Nicaraguans poured into a Miami that was more 
prepared for a jewel-daubed, jet-set Super Bowl crowd than a scruffy throng of 
penniless and confused aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions are that this is just the beginning. As many as 100,000 are 
expected to arrive during 1989, an influx that is making state and local 
officials gasp, for who, dear Uncle Sam, is going to pay the bills? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a national matter prompted by our nation's foreign policies, and this 
burden must be shared with the federal government and the citizens of the other 
49 states," Gov. Bob Martinez wrote last week in a letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Florida officials see events as a kind of Rube Goldberg contraption, at the end 
of which Miami gets a whack in the jaw: The Reagan Administration's policy 
against the Sandinistas has miscarried. That has contributed to an exodus from 
Nicaragua. Immigration authorities cannot control U.S. borders. Thousands leave 
for haven in America. To most of them, America means Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government largely turned its back on the taxpayers of Florida 
during the Mariel boat lift . . . and the people of this state simply will not 
abide being abandoned once again," Gov. Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, President Jimmy Carter encouraged Cubans to board a "freedom flotilla" 
across the Florida Straits. State and local taxpayers were burdened with huge 
costs to care for the refugees, and federal reimbursement fell an estimated 
$100 million short. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is the sense that Miami is in for it yet again. Civic leaders have 
gone off to Washington to protest. Editorialists are breathless. 
</P>
<P>
The stream has "the potential of swelling into a tidal wave that would engulf 
Greater Miami, causing social and economic destruction more severe than any 
American city anywhere has ever experienced," said the Miami Herald last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguans mostly arrive aboard Greyhound buses, the seats all full but 
the cargo holds empty. The refugees often have nothing more with them than a 
vague idea of a single place -- mystical, abundant, beckoning: Miami. 
</P>
<P>
In a shirt pocket is a crumpled piece of paper with the phone number of a 
relative or a friend or a friend of a friend. Sometimes it's enough, sometimes 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand this," said Maria Rodriguez Zambrana, a frustrated woman 
unable to translate the recorded voice at the other end of the phone. She was 
trying to make a toll call; she needed to insert more coins. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans are nothing new here. Since the Somoza regime fell in 1979, some 
100,000 to 150,000 have made Miami their home. The adjacent town of Sweetwater 
has been dubbed Little Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Families of four have become extended families of 10 and more, but there has 
been a spillover, too. In December, city officials decided to turn a baseball 
field, Bobby Maduro Stadium, into a shelter -- a stopgap solution at best and 
one that must necessarily end Jan. 23. It is time to prepare for spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
For many here, the use of the ballpark was their first awareness of a refugee 
problem. Then, before long, the situation changed much for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a federal judge temporarily ruled that refugees awaiting review of 
asylum applications could not be restricted from travel by immigration 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
That freed thousands who had been caught in a bottleneck in South Texas, where 
they crossed the border. Bus fare to Miami is $89. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has to declare an emergency because it won't take long before we 
have 5,000 people sleeping on the streets," warned Msgr. Bryan Walsh, who has 
long worked with refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Miami by turns has reacted with charity and anxiety. The city takes a certain 
pride in being a sanctuary from hemispheric tempests. Refugees are seen as part 
of Miami's vigor and resilience and eternal youth. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have walked and rode such a very great distance are people of 
focus," said school board member Janet McAliley. "They may not yet have 
marketable skills, but they understand the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
But there is an inevitable apprehensiveness, too. The refugees will require 
health care, emergency shelter, food and clothes. Public schools must open 
their doors to students who need remedial help. 
</P>
<P>
And, by their numbers, the Nicaraguans will further change the ethnic equation 
of an area already 43% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Florida overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment making 
English the state's official language -- a vote seen in part as a reaction 
against the continuing stream of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to call out the Texas National Guard and lock up the border," said 
Dr. Mark LaPorta, who worked for the amendment. "Charity is fine, but it gives 
the signal that we're ready to accept all these people." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, any such signals of acceptance are of much concern. 
</P>
<P>
City officials want the federal government to give the Nicaraguans work 
permits. Yet the more easily some adjust to Miami, the more attractive the city 
becomes to others not yet on their way. 
</P>
<P>
"If Washington learned anything from Mariel, it's that America must have an 
immigration policy based on order and fairness," said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.).

SOVIET MEDIA BID FAREWELL TO REAGAN, SHULTZ

The Soviet media once fumed at President Reagan, but the nation's two most 
prestigious newspapers bid respectful and even fond farewells Monday to Reagan 
and his secretary of state, George P. Shultz, for helping U.S.-Soviet 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Reagan has remained Reagan, the anti-Communist and the troubadour 
of Western society," the government newspaper Izvestia said in a front-page 
article. "But the restructuring of international relations could not bypass the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Reagan quipped into an open microphone that he would begin bombing the 
Soviet Union in five minutes. In the last days of his presidency, however, 
Soviets recall not those "five minutes" but his five summit meetings with 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
"And this is not because we have short memories but because a long road lies 
ahead of us, which we can only overcome together," wrote the newspaper's 
commentator, former U.S.-based correspondent Melor Sturua. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, the Communist Party daily, painted an extraordinarily intimate portrait 
of Shultz, Reagan's secretary of state since July, 1982, and declared: "It will 
be just to note that Shultz was one of the architects of the turning-point in 
Soviet-U.S. relations." 
</P>
<P>
In the recent warming between the superpowers, Pravda said, "Shultz's realism 
had a telling effect, as well as his sober recognition of the fact that in the 
nuclear age, the self-preservation of our two countries can be guaranteed only 
by the avenues of dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state is also the father of five children, an experienced 
gourmet cook, an ardent golf and tennis player and an avid devotee of ballroom 
dancing, Pravda told its readers -- surprising revelations in a country where 
most citizens know virtually nothing about the lives of their own leaders.

POLISH LEADERS OPENLY TACKLE ISSUE OF LEGALIZING SOLIDARITY

In what could be a landmark session of the Central Committee of Poland's 
Communist Party, authorities began to grapple openly Monday with the question 
of legalizing the banned trade union Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we will draw directions of democracy which will include some pluralistic 
solutions," the party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, said as he opened the 
two-day committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
More than once Jaruzelski referred to "pluralism," a concept often proposed by 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa as the key to solving Poland's intractable 
political and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 230-member Central Committee was also told by the party's leading 
ideologist, Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, that "the problem of trade 
union pluralism is becoming ripe to be solved." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Orzechowski nor Jaruzelski mentioned Solidarity by name, but the issue 
was clear to party conservatives and reformers alike. Both are expecting a 
heated discussion before the meeting ends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Legalization 
</P>
<P>
The question of legalizing Solidarity has been gathering force since last 
August, when strikes by union activists were ended at Walesa's urging after the 
government promised to enter into discussions with Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
But party hard-liners have balked at legalizing the union, and Solidarity's 
leaders have refused to take part in discussions with the government until it 
grants legal status to the union, which was suspended and later outlawed after 
a 1981 martial-law decree. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the authorities and the official news media have taken pains 
to describe Walesa as a moderate voice in the opposition, and this suggests 
that the Communist leadership is trying to win over party hard-liners, 
particularly among officials of the state-sanctioned trade union alliance, the 
military and the police -- the party "apparatus," as it is called. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski told the meeting Monday that the party wants pluralism but not 
pluralism that is "confrontational, destructive, anarchizing." 
</P>
<P>
He said that after a decade of economic decline, Polish citizens have become 
"irritated and unsure about the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Radical Reconstruction' 
</P>
<P>
"The priority goal," he said, "is radical and irrevocable reconstruction of 
social life so that . . . there is a place in it for all citizens who recognize 
the supreme interests of our country and the unchangeable shape of its 
essential framework." 
</P>
<P>
Although the reference to "supreme interests" is usually taken to mean the 
primacy of the Communist Party and the state's relationship with the Soviet 
Union, the party's conservative elements are increasingly concerned that reform 
efforts can only dilute the party's authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Many party members have doubts about a successful dialogue," said Manfred 
Gorywoda, the party leader from Katowice, one of the first hard-liners to take 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Orzechowski said that any move to allow more than one legal trade union should 
be accompanied by guarantees that there would be no repeat of the "events of 
1981," when factories became "arenas of political struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa has argued repeatedly in recent months that the legalization of 
Solidarity would not mean a return to the chaotic days of 1981, which were 
characterized by widespread strikes and economic paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
Orzechowski said that those who want to contribute to the welfare of the state 
and nation, while respecting the constitution, should be allowed to "function 
legally within the state structures, and not against them."

BONN CONFIRMS LIBYA POISON GAS PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE MINISTER CITES WEST GERMAN FIRMS' ROLE IN BUILDING IT

<P>
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Monday that his 
government has decided that a controversial chemical plant in Libya was built 
with West German help and was designed to make poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg's comment was the first indication that a senior member of the West 
German government has come to accept that the plant was designed to produce 
chemical weapons, as the United States has charged. And it follows a series of 
disclosures that a number of West German companies may have played important 
roles in the construction of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a prosecutor in Belgium said that the owner of a Belgian 
shipping company has admitted sending to Libya the construction material, 
equipment and chemicals for a complete chemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg told a news conference in Bonn that "we have to assume that at this 
factory there is a section that will be able to produce poison gas." He said 
the assumption "is based on concrete indications and reports." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denials From Bonn at First 
</P>
<P>
Libya insists that the plant in question -- at Rabta, about 40 miles southwest 
of Tripoli -- was designed to produce only pharmaceuticals. For a time, 
officials of the West German government, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
seemed to accept this, and Bonn denied there was any evidence that West German 
companies had provided plans or supplies for the chemical complex. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington has pressed Bonn with evidence in support of its charges that 
West German firms have helped set up the plant and that it was designed to be a 
major producer of poison gas. In recent weeks, statements from West German 
officials grew contradictory. And last Friday, Friedhelm Ost, chief spokesman 
for the Bonn government, said officials had received "serious information" that 
a West German firm, Imhausen-Chemie, was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Imhausen-Chemie had emerged from a Finance Ministry investigation with what 
appeared to be a clean bill of health, but Ost's comments made it clear that 
the firm was under new suspicion. He said evidence implicating Imhausen-Chemie 
had been disclosed as long ago as last October. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg indicated Monday that the BND, the West German intelligence agency, 
had reported to Bonn on the Libyan plant's weapons-making capability, but he 
said the BND had "emphatically urged" the government not to undertake a public 
investigation of Imhausen-Chemie because intelligence sources would be 
compromised. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vague Reports 
</P>
<P>
Also, Stoltenberg said, early West German intelligence reports concerning the 
Rabta plant "were so vague that, for legal reasons, the launching of executive 
measures was not justified." 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, part of the information concerning 
Imhausen-Chemie, which is now under a formal criminal investigation here, was 
gathered by communications intercepts. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said that records from the Frankfurt office of another firm, IBI 
Engineering, "suggested a possible or suspected involvement by German firms in 
illegal activities" in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Run by Iraqi 
</P>
<P>
IBI Engineering, based in London, is run by Ihsan Barbouti, an Iraqi, who 
admits to building a facility at Rabta but denies that it was intended to 
produce poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, prosecutor Christine Dekkers said that Jozef Gedopt, 44, the head 
of a Belgian shipping company, is being held on suspicion of forging documents 
relating to goods transshipped to Libya after they were sent first to other 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Antwerp magistrate Walter de Smedt said that a second man has been arrested in 
the case and added, "We are sure that huge amounts of chemicals have been sent 
to Libya." 
</P>
<P>
According to West German press reports, there is a connection between the 
Belgian shipping firm, Cross Link, and West German chemical manufacturers.

NO BOMBING PLAN, REAGAN SAYS

President Reagan said Monday that the United States had not planned to bomb 
what U.S. officials identified as a Libyan poison gas plant despite his comment 
last month that no decision had been made on such a bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"No, . . . we were not planning such an option," Reagan said in a interview 
with Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan prompted widespread speculation that the United States was considering 
such a bombing raid when he was asked in a television interview broadcast Dec. 
22 whether there was a possibility of removing the plant by bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let me say that's a decision that has not been made yet," Reagan replied 
then. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan said in the interview broadcast Monday night that bombing the Libyan 
chemical plant at Rabta south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli had not been an 
option after all. 
</P>
<P>
He made the comment when asked if he had decided against "taking out" the plant 
because that might adversely affect President-elect Bush, who will succeed 
Reagan on Friday.

PROPOSALS TO SAVE SALTON SEA, FISH BEING EXAMINED

<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are examining ways to save the Salton Sea, the state's largest 
inland body of water, which is already saltier than the ocean and threatens to 
wipe out its fish population. 
</P>
<P>
A report by Occidental College researchers concludes that the sea, 150 miles 
southeast of Los Angeles, could generate $200 million in annual revenue as a 
fishery and recreation area. But first, $350 million must be raised to fight 
rising salinity, which threatens fish, the report said. Construction could cost 
another $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sea was formed between 1905 and 1907 when the Colorado River broke through 
irrigation gates and flowed into a salt-covered depression in the Imperial 
County desert. There is no drain for the sea, and evaporation over the years 
has left the water about 20% saltier than the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests digging a canal from the Gulf of California to the sea to 
bring in less saline ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers next month 
are expected to study the idea, which has been criticized as extreme.

DROP IN STROKE, HEART DEATHS REPORTED 
</P>

<P>
The death rates from coronary heart disease and stroke in the United States 
fell 27.9% and 40.2% respectively between 1976 and 1986, according to new 
American Heart Assn. statistics that officials say illustrate continuing 
progress against the country's No. 1 killer. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease claimed about 978,500 lives in 1986, 
according to the annual report released Monday. That is about one life every 32 
seconds and more than twice the 466,000 lives claimed by cancer, the 
second-leading cause of death, the association stated. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that about 66 million of the estimated 241 million 
Americans alive in 1986 had at least one form of cardiovascular disease. Many 
deaths from those conditions, which include heart attack and stroke, are 
considered preventable through changes in life style and diet. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings in the report: 
</P>
<P>
* The rate of total cardiovascular disease among Americans dropped nearly 20% 
between 1976 and 1986. As with coronary heart disease and stroke, the decline 
is traceable to new forms of therapy and medication as well as changes in 
eating and living habits. 
</P>
<P>
* About 1.5 million Americans will suffer a heart attack in 1989. More than 
500,000 of them will die, most before they reach a hospital. Studies suggest 
that 50% of heart attack victims wait more than two hours before going to an 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
* Among adults, 38% of black men and 39% of black women have high blood 
pressure -- compared to 33% of white men and 25% of white women. Elevated blood 
pressure, indicating that the heart is working harder, may contribute to heart 
attacks, strokes and atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
* The heart association estimates that the cost of cardiovascular diseases in 
1989 will be $88.2 billion. That figure includes $56.3 billion in hospital and 
nursing home care, $15 billion in lost productivity, $12.5 billion in physician 
and nursing services and $4.4 billion in medication.

VIOLENCE FLARES AFTER MAN DIES IN MIAMI POLICE CHASE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civil disturbance broke out in this city's predominantly black Overtown area 
Monday evening, after police shot at two men on a motorcycle during a 
high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle slammed head-on into an oncoming car and the cycle's driver was 
killed, though police did not say whether a gunshot or the accident caused the 
death. The motorcycle passenger was critically injured and two people in the 
car were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened at 5:45 p.m. The street immediately grew tense. A woman, 
identified by police as the dead man's mother, began to wail. 
</P>
<P>
As the two men were being removed from the scene, officers and news crews were 
attacked with rocks and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Miami Police Department quickly was mobilized, and state troopers 
were put on alert. Officers entered the area in full riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Everyone Soothed 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Xavier Suarez tried to calm people, walking amid the crowd. "I'm going to 
check into it; I guarantee it," the mayor promised. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was soothed. Many witnesses claimed that the shooting of the black 
men on the motorcycle was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, sniper fire began and stores were looted. Three cars, including two 
belonging to television stations, were burned. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had several officers hit with rocks and bottles, and some incidents have 
spread out of the original area," police spokesman Sgt. Michael Mazur said. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-square mile area of the city was cordoned off. Some blocks in Overtown were 
evacuated. Expressway exits near the neighborhood were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Toward midnight, blazes were still being set. About 150 people wandered the 
streets. Snipers prevented firefighters from putting out the flames at an auto 
parts store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Onlookers cluttered the emergency lanes along major expressways, staring down 
from the elevated highways at people setting fires and tossing bottles. 
</P>
<P>
It was a dreary end to a day when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday was 
celebrated. And it was a bleak way to begin Super Bowl Week, when Miami is 
trying to put on its best face as a sunny resort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bengals Staying Nearby 
</P>
<P>
Overtown borders downtown Miami and it is only half a mile from the Omni Hotel, 
where the Cincinnati Bengals are staying. The upper floors provided clear views 
of the fires nearby. Joe Robbie Stadium, the site of Sunday's Super Bowl XXIII, 
is about 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The same Overtown neighborhood was the site of burning and looting in 1982, 
after a 21-year-old black man was fatally shot in an arcade by a Latino 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, racial violence in the city's Liberty City area left 18 people dead. 
That riot occurred after an all-white jury acquitted four police officers in 
the beating death of a black insurance agent, Arthur McDuffie. 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie too was chased by police while he was riding his motorcycle. Monday's 
incident, like more than a dozen in past years, will renew questions about 
whether the Miami police are too prone to use force against black suspects.

OPENING THE FLOOD GATEWAYS FOR ARTY IMAGES OF CIVIC PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank official once suggested placing giant replicas of phonograph records 
and a giant "B" made of ersatz film along an adjacent stretch of the Ventura 
Freeway to let tourists (and perhaps some residents) know where they were. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt fearful of what Johnny Carson would say, the city rejected that idea. 
</P>
<P>
But now Burbank lawmakers are considering dressing up the town with smaller 
civic artworks depicting cameras, palm trees and airplanes as well as a sign 
spelling the city's name in pink and blue neon. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is titled the Burbank Gateway Study, not to be confused with Los 
Angeles' proposed West Coast Gateway over the Hollywood Freeway or the Gate of 
Angels, a losing entry in the Olympic Boulevard West International Design 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
G-Word Onslaught 
</P>
<P>
Even before the G-word onslaught, civic symbols were becoming something of an 
art form in Southern California, which has seen the emergence in recent years 
of a "South Gate" water tank, a "Compton" obelisk (formerly Alameda Auto 
Supply), a "Monterey Park" signpost on a hill and an "East Los Angeles" arch 
(El Arco) across Whittier Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, residents saved a blurred landmark along the Pasadena Freeway that 
for a few years had spelled out "City of South Pasadena" in weeds. 
</P>
<P>
Civic image-making impulses are particularly strong in a county where 84 cities 
are struggling for an identity separate from big brother Los Angeles, hoping to 
bolster local pride and local treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much competition among cities these days that you have to 
differentiate," said Bill Kelly, assistant executive director of Burbank's 
Redevelopment Agency. "In our case, you can't really tell when you've left L.A. 
and entered Burbank. It's one long strip-shopping area." 
</P>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge's colorful wooden sign on its east flank, depicting an oak 
tree stretching across a mountain, symbolizes the sort of elegant horsy image 
that the city wants to present as well as the craftsman architecture (heavy on 
timber and stone) that dominates its business section. One underlying goal? 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to encourage more shopping," said City Manager Don Otterman. "Our 
largest source of revenue is sales taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens, like Burbank, recently hired an outside planner to suggest 
ideas for an attractive welcome mat. And West Hollywood, which set out banners 
calling itself "The Creative City" for awhile, is considering more permanent 
identifiers. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with some cities is that they don't know who they are or what they 
are," said landscape designer Lawrence Moss, the man hired to tell people what 
Burbank is a gateway to. "Even L.A. has this phobia of competing with New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
Paying for civic monuments is also an obstacle. Whether Los Angeles' 
controversial Gateway deserves to be known as "Steel Clouds" (the designer's 
term) or "Broken Popsicle Sticks" (one critic's term) is academic unless an 
estimated $33 million can be raised for its construction. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate, which called itself "Gateway to the Ocean" long before Los Angeles 
came up with its West Coast Gateway scheme, at one time considered placing 
small archways at every entrance to the city. But South Gate dropped the idea 
because of the "exorbitant cost," said Patricia Elkins of the city engineering 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Less seriously considered was a proposal by a local restaurateur a few years 
ago to hang a huge clock over one entrance with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thrifty Solution 
</P>
<P>
Instead, South Gate took the inexpensive step of slapping its moniker on the 
side of a water tank overlooking the Long Beach Freeway to emphasize its status 
as one of the few local cities that has its own water company and own wells. 
</P>
<P>
(The luster of that distinction has dimmed somewhat with the recent loss of 55% 
of South Gate's water supply due to the closing of contaminated wells.) 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, where lawmakers have complained of the city's reputation as a 
freeway food stop, sculptor Natalie Krol was asked to fashion a work 
symbolizing the town's role in motion picture history. 
</P>
<P>
She proposed a 7-ton, 18-foot-tall stainless-steel strip of film. But her fee, 
$130,000, was a concern until the city hit upon the idea of having donors sign 
their names in tile around the work. Residents came up with the whole tab. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a lot of letters from people telling me how much they enjoy it," 
Krol said. "It's used as a background for photographing graduation classes, 
it's a symbol of the industry and it's a heroic symbol, something larger than 
life that brings the viewer a sense of connecting to something imposing." 
</P>
<P>
Residents elsewhere chipped in to save the "City of South Pasadena" sign, a 
landmark dating back to 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, originally made of flowers and plant material, had been ripped out 
and dug up over the years by two forms of pests: teen-agers and gophers. The 
city said it couldn't afford to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked so awful for a while," remembered Doris Gertmanian of South Pasadena 
Beautiful, a civic group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$20,000 for Remodeling 
</P>
<P>
So after the sign had languished in weeds for six years in the late 1970s, the 
group raised $20,000 and installed a sturdier set of letters -- made of 
cobblestones. 
</P>
<P>
The civic effort is a statement "that we have a great deal of pride in our 
community," Gertmanian said. 
</P>
<P>
Lights have even been added, creating a new pest problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Children keep knocking them out with rocks," Gertmanian said. "But we hope to 
get some type of protective shields for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Gateway Study came about after City Council members noticed a "City 
of Glendale" sign made of polished granite on Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Glendale is somewhat conservative and that's what this sign says -- it's very 
solid, secure and substantial looking," said Moss, its designer. 
</P>
<P>
Of his Burbank assignment, Moss said: "The important thing is to create an 
attractive design, but one that isn't garish and won't be dated within a few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
So he avoided the giant-phonograph-records-along-the-freeway concept as well as 
a previous suggestion to place benches adorned with life-size replicas of 
celebrities around Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Moss' monuments -- which would stand at city entrances as well as in front of 
the Civic Center -- would symbolize the city's role as a home of the 
entertainment industry and as the site of Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. 
Suggested materials range from concrete, polished marble and neon to tile and 
glass cubes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, city officials are noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, of the redevelopment agency, said: "We didn't put any constraints upon 
him (Moss). We said, 'You tell us what Burbank is.' "

GUNMAN BARRICADED FOR 6 HOURS GIVES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman who for six hours barricaded himself and his children inside his 
Hermosa Beach home after an argument with his wife surrendered to authorities 
at dawn Monday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Barnum, 32, left his 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter asleep and 
unharmed when he came out the front door of his house, Hermosa Beach Police 
Cmdr. Anthony Altfeld said. Police came to the home at 736 Monterey Blvd. after 
Barnum fired a single pistol shot into the air from the porch of his home 
shortly after midnight, Altfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnum's wife told police that she had left the house earlier after an argument 
with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Barnum surrendered when a sheriff's special weapons team arrived and ordered 
him out of the house, Altfeld said. He was booked on suspicion of reckless 
discharge of a firearm and may also be charged with possession of marijuana and 
cocaine, small amounts of which were found inside the house, Altfeld said.

MAN IN CAR ROBBED, SLAIN; 3 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juvenile and two 18-year-old companions were arrested early Monday in the 
slaying of a Los Angeles man during an apparent robbery in La Puente, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects shouted the name of a gang as they drove away, Deputy Roger Hom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Javier Otero, 30, was sitting in a car with two friends 
about 11:30 p.m. Sunday when another automobile containing three teen-agers 
drew up alongside. One of the three, a 15-year-old boy, reportedly kicked in 
the driver's window, demanded money and fired once with a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Otero died at the scene, but his two friends were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they went to an area frequented by members of the gang, found the 
car believed used by the suspects and soon arrested the youth as well as Manuel 
Cervantes and Daniel Torres. All three were held for investigation of murder. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate shooting believed to be gang-related, a 31-year-old woman was 
wounded late Sunday when two young men fired more than a dozen shots into a 
Southeast Los Angeles home she was visiting, police said. Cheryl Harris of 
Moreno Valley in Riverside County was in serious condition at Martin Luther 
King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were in custody.

SUPER BOWL HAS RETURNED, GIVING MIAMI AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR ITS DAMAGED 
IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

for 9 seasons.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miami's Super Bowl delegation watched dutifully what Los Angeles did. Then it 
peered a little closer over San Diego's shoulder, all the while taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the things they did in hosting Super Bowls and how they did 'em," 
said Dick Anderson, former Miami Dolphins defensive back who is serving as 
chairman of Miami's Super Bowl host committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we developed our plan along those lines and tried to take one giant step 
forward. We wanted to make sure that we were more organized than anybody's ever 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Now Miami's self-styled SuperHost Committee feels ready to invite the world 
into its living room -- and is fully mobilized to make people forget how much 
of an obnoxious jerk it once was. 
</P>
<P>
Miami knows well the stakes this week: The polishing of a badly tarnished 
international image, and the resultant millions in tourist and 
business-relocation dollars. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen by the world as a Super Bowl site in 1979, Miami was accurately 
depicted as gouging and unfriendly. The city apparently had come to feel that 
serving as host to the Super Bowl was one of its unalienable rights, since 5 of 
the first 13 were played at the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But National Football League owners put the city in its place. With the 
impassioned help of Dolphin owner Joe Robbie, who constantly fought with city 
officials, Miami was ceremoniously yanked out of the Super Bowl rotation. 
Indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Then Robbie built his own stadium, which opened for the 1987 season. That 
suddenly had him locking arms with Miami's Super Bowl backers. In fact, 
Robbie's money-motivated switch of allegiances clearly was the single most 
important factor in Super Bowl XXIII being played at Joe Robbie Stadium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"This Super Bowl isn't in Miami because of the city or because of Dade County," 
said Norman Braman, the Philadelphia Eagles' owner and a Miami resident. "This 
Super Bowl is in Miami because of Joe Robbie." 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned about the area's sagging image figured that as long as 
America's most hyped event was going to be in their back yard, it behooved them 
to show that Paradise Lost, as bugled so damagingly in Time magazine a few 
years back, had become Paradise Found. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Levin, one of the founders of the Beacon Council, an organization formed to 
recruit businesses, said that after charges of unfriendliness and gouging at 
the '79 Super Bowl, and after a massive influx of Marielitos from Cuba, Miami 
became the target of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, it seemed, you picked up a magazine or a newspaper and they were 
dogging Miami," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
"People began to get angry about it. They'd go to Detroit, and people in 
Detroit are telling them they're afraid to come to Miami. Well, that's 
laughable. But the whole thing was getting very upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of that anger came a constructive bent, a desire to do something 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"This community probably has taken a tougher series of jolts than any community 
in the country and overcome them faster and with more style and more 
effectively than any other community in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Now Miami clearly feels it has a story to tell. And this is the message, 
according to Levin: Miami is not a place where you have to be afraid to walk 
around. It's a delightful town that took its lumps, admitted them, came to 
grips with them, solved those problems and created a more vibrant, exciting 
kind of a town. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is the public-relations version. Privately, there is much 
chagrin that thousands of homeless Nicaraguans are being bused into Miami at 
precisely the time that the town is geared to turn on its charm. 
</P>
<P>
Miami suffered another blow Monday night as a civil disturbance broke out in 
the city's predominantly black Overtown area, after police shot at two men on a 
motorcycle during a high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, sniper fire began, stores were looted and cars set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Expressway exits near the area were closed and Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez 
declared the disturbance "contained" about 5 hours later. Officials announced 
five schools in the area would be closed today. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of the disturbance is at least 10 miles from Joe Robbie Stadium in 
north Dade County, the site of the Super Bowl. But the Cincinnati Bengals are 
staying a half mile away from the Overtown section. 
</P>
<P>
If that wasn't enough, one of the SuperHost Committee vice chairmen is Sergio 
Pereira, a former county manager who resigned last year after a series of 
incidents involving stolen suits and mysterious land deals. Another is 
restaurateur Monty Trainer, who took time off from preparing for trial on two 
counts of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the sheer bulk of a Super Bowl visitor list approaching 100,000 is 
a big job, hence some 2,000-plus volunteers. One major change from the 1979 
disaster, Levin said, is for the county to consolidate into a central voice in 
three key areas: tourism (Greater Miami Convention and Visitor Bureau), 
economic development (Beacon Council) and chamber of commerce (Greater Miami). 
</P>
<P>
"From the business point of view, those are the legs on the table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, the Dade County commission provided another leg. It created 
the Greater Miami Super Bowl Host Committee, later to become simply the Miami 
SuperHost Committee. It anted up $150,000 to get the committee rolling and 
appointed Charles Scurr, an executive assistant to the county manager, as 
full-time committee president. 
</P>
<P>
From there, a seven-member executive committee brainstormed on covering all the 
proverbial Super Bowl bases, starting with assuring friendliness and price 
controls on through to addressing safety and tourist information. The SuperHost 
Committee has 16 committees that are so well-organized that even their 
subcommittees have committees. 
</P>
<P>
Scurr said he has a $1.9-million cash budget and another $1 million-plus in 
services with which to promote the area. Some of the bigger chunks of cash have 
been supplied by the state, $250,000; Dade County, $150,000; Burger King, 
$150,000, and Pepsi, $80,000. And the Miami Herald is a prime example of "in 
kind" help. It is printing 250,000 copies of a 24-page tabloid visitors' guide, 
to be distributed at hospitality stations -- 7 at the airport and 32 at 
NFL-designated hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson, the SuperHost chairman: "One of the gratifying things about this 
effort is the total community support we've gotten. For the most part, whenever 
we've asked for something, and given them the reasons why we want it, they've 
come through. 
</P>
<P>
"Like the Department of Transportation. Everybody says they're impossible to 
work with. We went to them, sat down in person, outlined what we want to do 
with NFL highways and came up with solutions, and they were supportive of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you meet a problem head on and meet with people and tell 'em what 
the value is, most people are really community spirited." 
</P>
<P>
With the DOT's permission, the SuperHost Committee put NFL helmet replicas on 
the 660 light poles of four Dade County expressways. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice idea, except for one thing. A number of the helmets were blown 
off by the wind last week and were hurled, like buzz saw blades, at passing 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
But the NFL Highways idea is being salvaged with more secure bolting, according 
to Scurr. 
</P>
<P>
Another idea being tested, paid for by Pepsi, is for four 30-story-high images 
of NFL players to be projected onto the sides of downtown skyscrapers. It's to 
call attention to downtown, but it's just as likely to be a little 
disconcerting to motorists on nearby I-95. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperHost Committee has addressed everything, particularly VIPs. A 
30-member committee was formed to attend a VIP's every need. The VIPs will 
receive options to get front-row tickets at any of seven major events -- such 
as the Liza Minnelli-Frank Sinatra concert. 
</P>
<P>
They have numbers to call for no-wait tennis, golf, fishing and boating. They 
have a VIP referral number for any type of medical assistance or special tour. 
They will have preferential parking at most places and a no-wait plan at the 49 
restaurants deemed by the committee as the area's best. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at Joe's Stone Crab, where people have been known willingly to wait up 
to 4 hours, an upstairs room has been opened and dubbed "the NFL room." It's 
strictly for VIPs, who include NFL team owners, heads of Fortune 500 companies, 
NBC-TV officials, governors and senators, major newspaper publishers and 
television station owners. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Casey, the SuperHost Committee's VIP coordinator, also is distributing a 
VIP card that allows the bearer entrance into any of 12 private clubs in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in happy endings, and by opening the door for these people to the 
activities they like to experience, and by treating them with respect, we think 
we will have some happy endings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's happy endings, as in companies moving a branch office here or holding a 
convention here. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kent, executive director of the Great Miami Super Bowl Host Committee, 
ventured on television early in the football season that in the interest of the 
area's economic health, he hoped the Dolphins didn't make it to the Super Bowl. 
That drew a wave of outrage from the local citizenry, but not a peep from hotel 
and restaurant owners, who figure to walk away with a sizable chunk of the 
projected $144 million that will be left in South Florida coffers by sundown 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That $144 million is the short-term benefit. Of much greater importance to 
SuperHost Committee organizers is what happens long term. As Casey said, how 
many conventions will be held in Miami as the result of this work, and how many 
companies will establish branch offices or their headquarters here? 
</P>
<P>
Robbie hoped to capitalize on this opportunity by selling some 69 vacant Robbie 
Stadium sky boxes at prices ranging from $29,000 to $65,000 a year, and 1,475 
remaining club seats, costing from $600 to $1,400 a year. 
</P>
<P>
No luck, though. The Dolphins were absolutely no playoff threat from the first 
play of the opening game against the Chicago Bears on through a dreary season. 
</P>
<P>
Please, though, save the crying towel for someone else. Robbie still stands to 
pocket more than $1.5 million profit merely for playing host. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the Miami Herald is doing its civic part. It has set up a "Super 
Bowl Action Line," and visitors are invited to complain about any injustice 
they may encounter. For example, the newspaper wants to know if a 5-mile cab 
ride from the airport to the hotel costs more than a 5-course meal. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald, as a Super Bowl watchdog, aims to solve as many problems as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Local police are breathing a little easier, now that San Francisco and 
Cincinnati have qualified for Sunday's game. They had feared a Chicago-Buffalo 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems that the fans who follow those two teams have a tendency in game 
situations to be a little more rowdy than others, and that results in more 
fights," said Metro-Dade Maj. Don Matthews, who is in charge of security 
planning for this Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews and his troops intend to round up vagrants and prostitutes as part of 
the overall effort to cleanse Miami's image. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, extra police officers will be everywhere this week, including some 
200 at Sunday's game. SWAT teams will be standing by for whatever needs arise. 
</P>
<P>
Police have identified what might be called the Seven Sins of Super Bowl. They 
include pickpocketing, ticket scalping, prostitution, counterfeiting of 
tickets, counterfeiting of NFL merchandise, hotel room burglaries and ticket 
snatch-and-runs. 
</P>
<P>
Even taxi drivers have been jostled by organizers and made to stand at 
attention. Drivers had to survive a 2-hour "optional" course in courtesy 
training before having their permits renewed. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,800 who endured the course, which was given in English, Spanish and 
Creole, were presented official SuperHost shirts to wear this week. 
</P>
<P>
Civic leaders clearly believe that this is much ado about something. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen," SuperHost president Scurr said Monday, peering out from his office to 
a panorama of posh Bay Pointe, "you've got to realize that having the Super 
Bowl in Miami is like nothing that's ever happened here before." 
</P>
<P>
He was reminded that there have been plenty of Super Bowls here. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said. "But those were just football games."

SCHULTZ CLOSES GAP BETWEEN MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATION

<P>
Richard Schultz, a former coach and athletic director who holds a commercial 
pilot's license, has manned the controls for 1 1/2 years as executive director 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His mission is to make sure that the NCAA flies right. 
</P>
<P>
He has attempted to do so with an open-door policy that is in direct contrast 
to that of his predecessor, Walter Byers. Until Schultz took over on Sept. 1, 
1987, Byers had been the NCAA's only executive director since the position was 
established in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reclusive Byers, a faceless figure who was heard but seldom seen, the 
NCAA was often portrayed as a mysterious, unbending organization that confused 
the public and created animosity between the office and its members. 
</P>
<P>
The engaging Schultz, 59, has moved to demystify the NCAA by maintaining a more 
public profile and by making himself available to the members and to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Schultz said, he spent 163 days on the road, 59 of them on college 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Cawood, an assistant executive director for the NCAA: "Walter was an 
outstanding administrator, but it was not his personality to be visible, be out 
front or to spend a lot of time away from the office. Dick's personality meshes 
with what was needed at the time he took the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been totally encouraged by his predecessor, by the staff and by his 
superiors to do what he's doing. And I think it's been proven in the last year 
that the executive director needed to be more visible." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz's personality has won new friends for the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt that I ever had a voice within the NCAA," Dale Brown, 
Louisiana State's basketball coach and a longtime critic of the organization, 
told the New York Times. "That's why I chose the public platform, because I 
felt that I wasn't one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
"Now with Dick Schultz, I feel totally different. I think he just knows what's 
going on. I would like to see a new organization formed, and I would like to 
see Dick Schultz be the head of it." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz believes that coaches and athletic directors have been quick to accept 
him because he is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Byers, whose background was in sports journalism and whose outlook was 
said to be more idealistic than realistic, Schultz brought experience at all 
levels of college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Kellogg, Iowa, a town of about 1,000 between Des Moines and Iowa City, 
he played basketball and baseball in high school, earning an athletic 
scholarship to Central College in Pella, Iowa, where he earned 10 varsity 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
He was married while in college, and he and his wife, Jackie, have raised two 
sons and a daughter in almost 40 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Until they moved to Kansas City, Mo., for the start of Dick Schultz's 5-year 
tenure as executive director of the NCAA, the couple had designed and built 
their last six houses, with Dick doing the building either by hand or as 
general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Schultz supplemented his income as a corporate pilot. 
</P>
<P>
But, first and foremost, he was a basketball and baseball coach, beginning his 
career at a high school in Humboldt, Iowa, where he spent 10 years. In 1960, he 
took a job as assistant baseball coach and freshman basketball coach at the 
University of Iowa and later served 8 years as head baseball coach and 4 years 
as head basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up coaching in 1974, Schultz spent 2 years as an assistant to the 
university president before moving to Cornell University as athletic director. 
At Cornell, and later at Virginia, he spent 11 years as an athletic director 
and also served as chairman of the NCAA basketball committee, negotiating the 
most recent contract with CBS, which reportedly is worth about $150 million to 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
He left behind a good life at Virginia, where his home had a majestic view of 
the Blue Ridge Mountains and his perks reportedly included membership in a 
country club, use of a university-owned plane and a $360,000 annuity that would 
have matured next year. 
</P>
<P>
And, in signing on with the NCAA, he accepted what basically is a thankless 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Violations among member schools continue to tarnish the image of the 
organization, which in the last 6 months has put 7 schools on probation. 
Sanctions against the Kentucky basketball program have yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schultz believed that he was somehow obligated to serve the NCAA in 
the interest of returning integrity to intercollegiate athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, on the eve of the NCAA convention in San Francisco, he discussed a 
variety of topics, including the changing role of his job, NCAA enforcement 
policy, integrity in college athletics and cases involving the Kansas 
basketball program and Oklahoma State football player Hart Lee Dykes. 
</P>
<P>
Question: You seemed to have it pretty good at Virginia. What prompted you to 
take this job? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: That's an interesting question. I had absolutely no interest in this 
job whatsoever. I liked Virginia. I thought I'd be there the rest of my life. I 
enjoyed being involved with the NCAA basketball committee. 
</P>
<P>
I was really caught off guard when the search committee contacted me in the 
first place and said I'd been recommended. I think it was late October, and it 
was not until January that I finally told them I would go the first step, but 
that I wouldn't be available until after the Final Four (in April). I had to 
give it a lot of thought. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to be sure that if I were the executive director, I would be in a 
position to make some positive contributions to intercollegiate athletics, so I 
talked to a lot of colleagues and a lot of people involved in the NCAA. They 
assured me that would happen and that I really ought to be interested in it. 
</P>
<P>
As the process went on, I had so many people say to me, 'You know, we really 
need somebody who has a strong sports background. You just have to do this.' So 
it kind of got to the point where I felt I had to do it, but I might not enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
I have to say that I've enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's like any 
job -- it has its good days and its bad days. But, so far, it's had more good 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is your perception of the role of executive director? 
</P>
<P>
A: The NCAA is an association, so I'm not a commissioner. I'm not like a 
Ueberroth or a Rozelle. A commissioner has the power to make penalties, make 
rulings on specific things. As the chief operating officer of the association, 
I don't have that authority. 
</P>
<P>
I think my responsibility, first of all, is to oversee the national office, 
which is a good-sized group of people, and make sure that the business of the 
association is carried out the way the members want it to be carried out. The 
NCAA's primary function is to be the governing organization for the member 
schools, but we're also a service organization. We do a lot of things other 
than interpret the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How have you changed the role of executive director? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's changed the way the members have wanted it to change. In the 
search process, it became very evident that they wanted an executive director 
who would be more visible to the membership. 
</P>
<P>
I spent 37 or 38 years as a coach and as an athletic director, so I feel 
comfortable with that group of people. This is why I've tried to be open. I 
think the major changes you've seen have been in the availability of the 
executive director and the attempts to make the organization more open -- take 
it out of the closet, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
People don't really understand the NCAA, or how it works. They view the NCAA as 
this bureaucratic organization in Mission, Kan., that makes all these 
controversial rules and puts your school on probation, and nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
We don't make rules and we can't change rules. Every rule that we have is 
something that six institutions have proposed and the convention has voted 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
So we've tried to take some time to explain that. The NCAA is the member 
institutions. It's not Dick Schultz. And we're trying to get people to 
understand that. 
</P>
<P>
I think the responsibility of the executive director is to provide leadership 
to the members, to take a look at the problems they have, help them solve those 
problems, present new ideas for doing things better. And then, of course, they 
have to react. So it's a leadership role, a management role, a public-relations 
role. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What further changes would you like to make? 
</P>
<P>
A: We need more flexibility in the way we administer our rules, especially as 
they deal with the student-athletes. I think too many times, because of the 
size of the organization, we pass a rule and we pass it in such a way that it 
covers a broad area, but there are individuals that fall through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
I've always felt that, if things were 50-50, the benefit ought to go to the 
athlete. So we're trying to promote more flexibility in the rules that apply to 
the athlete -- but, at the same time, be very firm with the rules that involve 
recruiting and be very firm with people who willfully violate those rules to 
gain a competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There seems to be a stepped-up vigilance toward some of the bigger-name 
schools. Is that reflective of your thinking? 
</P>
<P>
A: What that's reflective of, I think, is a commitment to make sure our 
enforcement staff is up to its full complement, and that we are doing things to 
make sure that we keep good, qualified people in those positions. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems has been the high turnover rate of our enforcement staff. 
Most of our enforcement people -- not all, but most of them -- have law 
degrees, and they get a year or two training with us and they become very 
attractive either for universities to hire as compliance people, or to law 
firms that want to specialize in sports law. 
</P>
<P>
So we need to be competitive in our ability to keep those people. We have done 
that, and for the first time in a long, long time, we have a full complement of 
people. And now we've gotten rid of a big backlog of cases that had been there 
for 2 or 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Cases tended to drag on? 
</P>
<P>
A: For a lot of different reasons, one of the reasons being that the 
enforcement staff is not a police department. They don't have police authority. 
They can't subpoena records, so it becomes a very laborious process to run 
people down and to be able to have access to people to interview. 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement process, if it works properly, is a cooperative effort between 
the institution and the enforcement staff. Occasionally, institutions don't 
cooperate, and that slows the process. And even changeovers at the institutions 
will slow down the process. 
</P>
<P>
But in meeting with the enforcement staff a few weeks ago, I told them that our 
goal, now that we were caught up and had a full complement of people, had to be 
to deal with these cases within 1 year. That's not going to be easy, simply 
because of the way the process works, but if we don't make that a goal, we'll 
never come close to it. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's obvious from what's happened that there aren't any sacred cows out 
there. One of the complaints throughout the years has been (about) selective 
enforcement. I personally don't think that's happened, but that's been the 
perception. There isn't anybody that can say that now -- not with some of the 
penalties that have been handed down lately, and to whom. 
</P>
<P>
I think a point needs to be made -- and it's very important, because all these 
cases that have come to a head in the last 30 days give the impression that 
there's a myriad of problems out there and everybody's cheating -- that's 
really not what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
You're seeing us get caught up. Our enforcement people feel this way. I talked 
to coaches and athletic directors; they feel the same way. They think we're 
really over the hump on the integrity thing and the enforcement issue. 
Violations are way down. And now that we've got these cases cleaned up -- other 
than the Kentucky case -- you're not going to see a lot of those kinds of 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you really believe that? Why would that be? 
</P>
<P>
A: A lot of reasons. I think the convention in 1985 that dealt strictly with 
integrity put more teeth into the penalties -- the death penalty at SMU was a 
great attention-getter; efforts that I've made; efforts that the membership 
have made to put integrity back into intercollegiate athletics; the 
establishment of a compliance department, the conference grants that we're 
awarding to help conferences set up compliance programs. 
</P>
<P>
We've just got a better system of checks and balances. But, most importantly, 
we have tremendous interest on the part of presidents and athletic directors 
and coaches to, quote, clean up the act. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are your personal views on cheating? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't subscribe to the fact that everybody's doing it. You have to 
remember that, in intercollegiate athletics, we have some problems, but we 
don't have any problems that are unique to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people want to say that drugs are unique to athletics or that cheating 
is unique to athletics. Every problem that we have is societal. You can look at 
society and you can see the same things. In fact, we have probably done a heck 
of a lot better job in solving our drug problem than society has. We've 
probably done a lot better job of solving most of our problems than society 
has. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to say that we don't have problems -- we do have -- but about 97% 
of everything that's going on today in intercollegiate athletics is very good 
and very positive. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the tremendous visibility of athletics, a prominent school goes 
on probation and the impression is, everybody's doing it and it's widespread. 
Or if we have one athlete that tests positive for drugs -- even though maybe we 
tested thousands and that the rate is like 1 1/2%, which is unbelievably low in 
today's society -- people will get the impression that everybody's doing it. 
</P>
<P>
That's just not the case. 
</P>
<P>
I feel very good about what's going on out there, but at the same time I know 
that, just like society, we're going to have people who feel pressure, and 
because of that pressure, they're going to step across the line because they 
think they have to. 
</P>
<P>
We can't be so naive to think that's not going to happen. But the important 
thing is to be sure that we're doing the best job we can to control it and that 
we've got it at a very low level. And I think we're approaching that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It was recently reported that Hart Lee Dykes, a football player at Oklahoma 
State, was given immunity by the NCAA for testimony that led to sanctions 
against Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas A &amp; M and Illinois. Do you approve 
of giving immunity? 
</P>
<P>
A: It isn't any different than plea-bargaining, which you see go on all the 
time. It depends on the circumstances and the situation. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for our investigators to tell student-athletes that if they 
don't cooperate and we find that they're in violation, they could be declared 
ineligible. So, by the same token, if you get the right cooperation, then 
perhaps there should be some type of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
I think there are probably degrees in that, just like there are degrees in 
plea-bargaining. But that isn't anything new. That's been going on for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last November, the Kansas basketball program was put on a 3-year probation 
for violations involving a player who never attended the university and a coach 
who is no longer there. Is penalization of schools more of a priority than 
penalization of individuals? 
</P>
<P>
A: Intercollegiate athletics work on the premise of institutional control. The 
institution has to be in control of the program. Every year, the president or 
chief executive officer has to sign off, as do all the coaches, that their 
programs are in compliance and that they haven't violated any rules. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if you strictly limited the enforcement process to individuals -- you can 
play this out in your own mind -- and individuals could be penalized while the 
institution went scot-free, think of the temptation to take people and make 
them scapegoats for the penalties so that the institution could go off and play 
in the bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
The institution itself cannot escape the responsibility for its program, and if 
the people who caused the problems are gone, somebody has to be responsible. 
You can't let them walk away from their lack of control because some people 
aren't there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What have you learned from visiting college campuses? 
</P>
<P>
A: The idea of visiting the schools was, of course, to follow through on the 
promise that I would be more visible and that I would be available. Also, it 
gave me an opportunity to get started on one of the major challenges that had 
to be dealt with, and that was the integrity issue. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems we had over the years is that we tried to legislate 
integrity, and we ended up with a very complicated rule book that no one 
understood. My personal feeling was that we could pass a lot more rules and we 
could double or triple the size of our enforcement staff, but we still would 
not have integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Solving the integrity problem is very simple: If we can get each institution to 
have complete integrity in their programs, we could solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
So, part of the reason for getting out on college campuses is to spend time 
with chief executive directors, faculty reps and athletic directors, and try to 
emphasize how I see this process working. 
</P>
<P>
The governing board has the responsibility for the integrity of everything that 
goes on at the university. They have to make sure they make the unpopular 
decisions, even if they involve a popular program or a popular individual. 
</P>
<P>
They can't waffle to alumni or booster pressure. They've got to stand firm and 
say, "This is what we believe in. This is the way it's got to work."

SCOTT OSTLER: IT MAY NOT BE TIME TO GIVE HIM THE HOOK

<P>
So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
What's all this business about the struggling Lakers, the over-the-hill 
ex-dynasty, the death watch on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? 
</P>
<P>
Everything looked fine Monday. The Lakers played the Houston Rockets at the 
Forum. Both teams are division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers murdered the Rockets, 124-113. Kareem went against the league's best 
center, Akeem Olajuwon, lived to tell about it and even scored 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had quintuple quadruples, or something like that. Every Laker was 
all-World. David Rivers played 1 minute and scored 4 points, which projects out 
to a 192-point game. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the deathbed Lakers seemed to be clinging to life with a certain 
spunky zeal. They looked a lot like the old young Lakers, who made this kind of 
fast-break ball a trademark, a new standard for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, of course, that the Lakers did it at home, but this is no time 
for pessimism. The boys looked good. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the game, Kareem posted up Akeem, took a pass from Byron 
Scott and skyhooked over Akeem. Like old times. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the court, Akeem posted Kareem, got a pass and wheeled 
around Abdul-Jabbar for an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
"Quit while you're even," some courtsider yelled at Kareem. 
</P>
<P>
Vicious. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar hung in there, though, played 29 minutes and hit 6 of 8 shots for 
12 points. Only got 3 rebounds, but Lazurus didn't climb off that table and run 
a 10K, either. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Fella did show signs of genuine interest in the game. It was Game 3 of 
the Kareem Watch, the 2-week probationary period, after which Coach Pat Riley 
will present Kareem his wings or relegate him to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK," Kareem said of his performance. "I shot the ball a little better. 
I was running the court a lot better. Hopefully it will all come together soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a little more confidence (in his shot) and a lot more stability." 
</P>
<P>
These are tough times for Kareem. He is trying to power through his 20th 
season, but he came to camp overweight, physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
He has played badly. He has looked his age. He has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing has happened -- Kareem has become a favorite of the fans. 
It's not so much a sympathy thing as an appreciation of what he has meant to 
the Lakers over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In his younger days, Kareem was publicly aloof and never captured the hearts of 
the fans. Now he has them. When he buries a skyhook, or grabs a defensive 
rebound and dribbles out, point-guard style, the Forum fans go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
They're rooting for the guy. They like him. It's actually heartwarming. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to that support is the fact that Kareem hasn't turned into a 
crybaby. This has been his toughest season, he has faltered and staggered, he 
has been criticized in the press, but he has shown class. 
</P>
<P>
Not once has Kareem blamed the media for his performance, not once has he 
lashed out at his critics, or at Riley for trimming his playing time, or at his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
There's no reason he should have, of course, but that hasn't stopped hundreds 
of other athletes in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The man has stood tall. 
</P>
<P>
"After training camp, after our first couple exhibition games, he was down," 
Riley said Monday. "He came to me and said, 'I'm just rusty, it's just not 
there anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'When you start believing that . . . ' Maybe Kareem went through 
some doubts. I think he's turned the corner, I think he's turned the switch on 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Riley and Kareem had a summit conference Jan. 14. "Give us more," Riley said, 
in essence. "OK, I'll give you what I've got," Kareem replied. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gonna make him live up to that," Riley said. "If I see him make a mental 
mistake, I'm going to say, 'Remember Jan. 14.' " 
</P>
<P>
Riley has defended Kareem all along, while Kareem was ignoring the criticism, 
or pretending to. 
</P>
<P>
"One quality about Kareem has always been his ability to take it (criticism)," 
Riley said. "It stings, it has to, it was bothering him, but he had to let it 
go. I don't think the team came to his defense quick enough." 
</P>
<P>
It's important for the Lakers not to overreact. That would embarrass Kareem. 
They could become like Lou Gehrig's Yankee teammates. Seeking to bolster Lou's 
spirits at the end of his playing days, the Yankees would praise him lavishly. 
</P>
<P>
Gehrig said he knew it was time to retire when his teammates gathered around 
him and slapped his back after he fielded a routine grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem doesn't need that kind of support. Lou was ill. Kareem is just old. 
</P>
<P>
He knows how he's playing and he realizes that only one person will decide 
whether he goes out in a blaze of glory or in ashes -- Kareem. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he has to kick it up another notch. The All-Star game is coming up in 
February. When a Houston writer asked him before Monday's game whether he 
thought he should be on the team, Kareem said: "If I make the team, it would 
mean that something's wrong, because I haven't played well. I don't deserve 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be selected, the commissioner should step in and allow a 
13-man squad or something. The league ought to give Kareem a Rolls-Royce. He's 
made the league a lot of money. He should be honored." 
</P>
<P>
It was suggested recently in this column that Kareem should be the league's 
non-playing honored guest at the All-Star game, and also that he should 
consider retiring at that time. 
</P>
<P>
He should finish out the season, I suggested, only if he can help his team. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is still out. Monday he was more assertive offensively, but he didn't 
shoot a free throw all day, and 3 rebounds isn't enough from a starting center. 
He needs to wade into the action more, at both ends of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when Akeem lost his man and drove the baseline, Kareem, waiting under the 
hoop, took a step back and watched. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly he was out there pushing himself, trying to rekindle the fire. The 
fans could see it. Kareem could feel it. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Big Fella do it? Stay tuned.

All of a sudden Oswego State hockey Coach Don Unger is a very popular man, and 
he doesn't like it one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"WNBC has called me, USA Today has called me," Unger said Monday. "I'm being 
bothered by everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, it seems, wants to know how it feels to be coach of the team that 
allowed the fastest goal in hockey history. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in a matchup of New York schools last Wednesday night when 
Brockport State's Chris Palin scored 3 seconds after the opening faceoff. At 
least, that's what the clock said in recording a goal 2 seconds faster than the 
official record in both the college and professional ranks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked up, the clock said 19:57," Palin said. "It seemed like the play 
had taken 4 or 5 seconds, but it said 19:57." 
</P>
<P>
There's only one problem -- the official scoresheet signed by referee Jim 
Zarnick says the goal was scored with 19:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
According to Unger, this is how the play developed: "The puck was dropped and 
we took the puck forward, that's 110 feet from the goal still." 
</P>
<P>
After Palin gained control, "our forward went through and hit their man as he 
was skating down the boards, he skated over the blue line, then cut toward the 
net and took a screen shot through two of our defensemen and scored. 
</P>
<P>
"The puck had to travel backward 15 or 20 feet, then diagonally about 20 feet, 
then it was passed another 20 feet to the red line. And then he had to skate it 
about 100 feet." 
</P>
<P>
"They supposedly started the clock late and the people working the scoresheet 
decided to put down 5 seconds," Brockport sports information director Mike 
Andriatch said. "The people at the scorer's table should have changed the clock 
right then. 
</P>
<P>
In case anyone missed it, Unger wants everyone to know the final score was 
Oswego State 8, Brockport State 5.

CONNECTICUT PUTS SYRACUSE IN CELLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun, seeking the right balance for his club's Monday 
night matchup against 11th-ranked Syracuse, stressed a slowdown on offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, playing before a sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center, 
combined just enough offense with a tight defense to upset Syracuse, 68-62, 
sending the Orangemen into last place in the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, playing hard is the key thing," Calhoun said. "If we try to set the 
tempo too much on offense, we stand around on defense. So we made ourselves 
press on defense and walk on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, on the other hand, blamed his team's loss on its 
lack of execution. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 15 minutes we played probably as poorly as we've played since I've 
been at Syracuse," he said after his club dropped to 14-4 overall and 1-4 in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (10-4, 2-3), who forced 16 turnovers and limited the Orangemen to 
22 of 54 shooting (40.7%), got 24 points from Cliff Robinson and 21 from Phil 
Gamble as they broke a 3-game conference losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse led only briefly in the game, scoring 15 of the first 19 points in the 
second half for a 39-35 lead with 14:35 left. But Gamble hit a 3-point basket 
and converted a 3-point play to put the Huskies in front for good. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan 99, Ohio State 73 -- Glen Rice made five 3-point shots and scored 23 
points as the sixth-ranked Wolverines coasted past the 16th-ranked Buckeyes at 
Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mills also scored 23 points and Loy Vaught added 22 for Michigan (15-2, 
3-1), which never trailed, opening a 20-12 lead in the first 6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (12-4, 2-2) cut the deficit to 27-26 on Jay Burson's basket with 
8:22 left in the first half, but that's as close as the Buckeyes could get as 
Michigan opened a 50-35 halftime lead and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal Robinson had 14 points and Sean Higgins 10 for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Carter scored 17 points for Ohio State, but Burson, averaging 23.9, had 
only 12. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the Wolverines' 14th straight at Crisler Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 104, Virginia Tech 99 -- Byron Irvin scored 35 points as the 
eighth-ranked Tigers held off a late rally by the Hokies at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (15-3), who led by as many as 20 points in the second half, also got 
19 points from Anthony Peeler, 14 from Doug Smith and 11 from Lee Coward as 
they extended their winning streak to 6 games. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech got 36 points from Wally Lancaster, who hit five 3-point shots 
and extended to 61 his National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record of consecutive 
games in which he has scored a 3-point basket. The Hokies (6-8) suffered their 
fifth straight loss, the most since the 1954-55 team lost 18 straight. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 78, Villanova 61 -- Ramon Ramos scored 10 points in a decisive run 
as the 12th-ranked Pirates beat the Wildcats at the Meadowlands to move into 
first place in the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall (16-1, 4-1) holds a half-game lead over Providence, marking the 
first time the Pirates have been alone in first place this late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who got 22 points from John Morton, forced the Wildcats into 17 
first-half turnovers and took control with a 23-11 spurt that began late in the 
first half and continued into second half. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova, (10-7, 2-3), closed to 25-21 before Ramos took over. The 6-foot 
8-inch center, who missed the Pirates' last game with an eye injury, scored the 
final 4 points of the first half and 6 of Seton Hall's first 8 in the second 
half, giving the Pirates a 38-27 edge with 17:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford 93, Miami (Fla.) 59 -- Howard Wright scored 21 points, including 11 
straight at the outset of the second half, to lead the No. 20 Cardinal to a 
nonconference victory over the Hurricanes at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who also had 8 rebounds, made all 7 of his shots in the second half as 
Stanford broke away from a 37-30 halftime lead to go ahead by 15 points midway 
through the second half. Center Eric Reveno scored 6 points during a 12-4 
Stanford spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (13-3) outscored the Hurricanes, 33-10, in the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Keefe, who grabbed 8 rebounds, and Reveno each added 16 points for the 
Cardinal and Todd Lichti, who scored 12 points, tied the school record he set 
last year by hitting his 35th consecutive free throw. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 69, San Jose State 48 -- Carrick DeHart scored 12 points in 
the first 7 1/2 minutes of the second half to led the Gauchos past the Spartans 
in a Big West Conference game at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara has won 4 of 5 conference games and 12 in 13 overall. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose, suffering its worst conference start in Coach Bill Berry's 10 years, 
dropped its fifth straight and is 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart scored 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State 53, Fresno State 50 -- James Anderson scored 14 points as the 
Aggies defeated the Bulldogs in a Big West Conference game at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (8-6, 3-2) had a chance to send the game into overtime, but a 
3-point shot by Jervis Cole missed as time ran out. Cole, averaging 18 points a 
game, was poked in the eye in the first half and scored only 7. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State (10-6, 3-3) led by 9 points in the first half before Fresno 
State cut the margin to 32-28 at halftime. The Bulldogs took a 42-41 lead 
midway through the second half, but Anderson's basket started a 6-point run and 
the Aggies never trailed again.

TRIPUCKA SCORES 40 AS HORNETS STING 76ERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Charlotte Hornets may be new to the National Basketball Assn., and losing 
practically every time they play on the road, but that doesn't mean they have 
grown accustomed to it. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Tripucka scored 40 points Monday at Philadelphia, including 9 in 
overtime, to lead the Hornets to a 127-122 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, 
breaking an 11-game road losing streak and giving Charlotte only its second win 
in 17 road games. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't won on the road," Tripucka said. "We figured it's time to change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
A basket by Rex Chapman, who scored 25 points, gave the Hornets a 120-118 lead 
with 1:21 left in overtime. Tripucka and Tyrone Bogues scored consecutive 
baskets to make it 124-118 with 50 seconds remaining, putting the game out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so important that we have some success for our effort," Charlotte Coach 
Dick Harter said. "We've played hard all year and had some tough losses." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia took a 110-107 lead with 32 seconds left in regulation on a basket 
by Charles Barkley, but Chapman made a 3-point shot with 15 seconds left to 
send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke down defensively to give Chapman a chance to shoot (a 3-pointer) at 
the end," Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam said. "We didn't shadow him." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 126, Phoenix 110 -- Mark Price scored 11 of his season-high 29 points 
in the third quarter, and the Cavaliers turned back the Suns' rally at 
Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers won for the 16th time in their last 19 games -- their 10th 
straight at home -- and improved their NBA-leading record to 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns have lost 3 of 4 games. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 18 points early in the game, Phoenix rallied to take a 70-69 lead 
early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns led, 74-73, when Cleveland's Ron Harper scored to start a 10-0 run 
that gave the Cavaliers the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
New York 116, San Antonio 106 -- Mark Jackson had 24 points, 10 rebounds and 12 
assists for his third career triple-double as the Knicks won their 14th 
straight home game. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks have won 5 straight and are 17-1 at home this season. The Spurs have 
lost 5 straight and 10 of their last 11 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by as many as 23 points in the second half, the Spurs climbed back to 
within 6 with 4:47 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks then ran off 6 consecutive points to take a 109-97 lead with 3:04 
left, after which the Spurs never drew closer than 8. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 116, Sacramento 110 -- Walter Davis scored 4 of his 27 points in a 
30-second span late in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets beat the Kings at 
Denver, ending a 4-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings led, 100-94, with 5:09 to play, but Denver came back on a 3-point 
basket by Davis and a field goal by Alex English at the 3:07 mark. 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied for the 13th time, 104-104, Davis stole the ball from the 
Kings' Harold Pressley and scored on a layup. Davis then scored again on a 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
A basket by Eddie Hughes put the game out of reach, 112-104, with 37 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Denver played without point guard Michael Adams, sidelined for the second 
straight game with a pulled hamstring, and center-forward Blair Rasmussen, who 
was out with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 117, Washington 106 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 28 points to lead the 
Hawks past the Bullets at Landover, Md., ending a 4-game losing streak.

Cliff Levingston and Moses Malone led a fourth-quarter Atlanta comeback that 
erased an 11-point deficit in less than 4 minutes. Levingston had 7 points, 
including the tying basket with 8:06 remaining, and Malone 6 in a 15-4 Atlanta 
run. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks eventually built their lead to as many as 11 points in gaining their 
first road victory since Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 96, Boston 87 -- Isiah Thomas scored 6 of his 16 points during a 13-3 
fourth-quarter run, as the Pistons beat the Celtics at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 11 points at halftime, Detroit outscored Boston, 29-16, in the 
third quarter -- including 17 of 19 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied early in the fourth quarter, Detroit scored 4 straight 
baskets to take a 79-71 lead. Boston never got closer than 4 points the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 146, Seattle 117 -- Chris Mullin scored 9 of his 31 points to 
spark a 26-10 run at the start of the third quarter, leading the Warriors past 
the SuperSonics at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors won their fifth straight and seventh in nine games since losing 
center Ralph Sampson for at least a month because of a knee injury. Manute Bol, 
Sampson's 7-foot 7-inch backup, also missed 2 games during that stretch, making 
6-8 forward Larry Smith the Warriors' tallest starter. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Richmond scored 27 points for Golden State and Terry Teagle had 22.

<P>
AT 7 FEET 7 INCHES, 380 POUNDS, ARGENTINE IS WORTH A SHOT TO THE HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlanta Hawks, who made it fashionable for National Basketball Assn. teams 
to hire little guys by signing Spud Webb a few years ago, apparently are at it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the Hawks have gone to the other extreme, spanning the 
globe to find what is believed to be the world's tallest and widest basketball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
He is Jorge Gonzalez of Argentina's national team. At 7 feet 7 inches, Gonzalez 
is the same height as Manute Bol of the Golden State Warriors. But, at 380 
pounds, Gonzalez is 160 pounds heavier than Bol. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the Hawks used the 54th pick in the draft to select Gonzalez, even 
though only one scout had seen him play in person. Stan Kasten, the Hawks' 
general manager, had only seen films of Gonzalez. But he said he was impressed 
by, well, the guy's height and weight, which make Manute look minute. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks will get a firsthand look at Gonzalez today in private workouts and 
physical tests for Kasten and other Hawk executives. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said he is looking at Gonzalez, still is under contract to play for the 
Argentine national team, as a long-term project. But the experiment worked with 
Bol, whose skills were as limited as his English when he first took up the 
game, so it figures to be worth the try with Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even seen him in person," Kasten said. "If we wanted to sign him, 
we'd have to work out a deal with his team in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"He can play. He has a nice offensive touch. He can score. Obviously, he's a 
great target down low. But he does not block shots yet, and he has very poor 
mobility up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
"That may preclude him from ever playing at this level. But if you're that big 
and can also score, it's a nice place to begin. He's only 22, so I guess we 
don't even know if he's finished growing, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said that Gonzalez will probably work out in Atlanta, on and off, until 
April, when basketball season in Argentina resumes. He remained noncommittal 
about whether the Hawks will try to sign Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to tell," Kasten said. "Hey, why are you asking? I mean, you 
guys in L.A. aren't that hard up for a replacement for Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar), 
are you?" 
</P>
<P>
Charges of domestic assault against Seattle SuperSonics star guard Dale Ellis 
were dropped last week, a few days after his wife filed a complaint that he 
struck her. 
</P>
<P>
That incident may be behind Ellis, the NBA's third-leading scorer behind 
Michael Jordan and Karl Malone, but speculative talk about the cause of the 
latest of several personal problems persists. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, Ellis has been arrested after a scuffle at a Dallas 
nightclub -- charges were dropped -- and has wrecked and abandoned a rental car 
on a freeway exit ramp. In addition, his wife, Monique, fought outside the 
locker room with Rene Lister, wife of center Alton Lister, after a game against 
the Lakers 2 seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I make mistakes like everybody else," Ellis said. "Everybody just gets carried 
away with it." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Sunday with columnist Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times, Ellis 
denied that drug use is the cause of his erratic behavior. Ellis said that, 
before he signed a new contract with Seattle over the summer, he told Coach 
Bernie Bickerstaff that he would submit to random drug testing whenever the 
SuperSonics deemed necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie and I have a different kind of relationship," Ellis said. "I can tell 
him things I can't tell a lot of people. When we talked last summer, I told him 
I just wanted to prove it to him. . . . I can't risk everything I've worked on 
for something as silly as (drugs). The older I get, the more I realize what's 
important in life and what's not." 
</P>
<P>
Although all parties denied it, there reportedly was some talk last week about 
a trade in which Indiana Pacers center Herb Williams would come to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
According to one report, there were negotiations for a 3-way trade that would 
send Williams to the Lakers, Orlando Woolridge from the Lakers to the New York 
Knicks and rookie Rod Strickland from the Knicks to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons why a trade bringing Williams to the Lakers seems 
remote now, biggest among them is the Lakers' salary cap restrictions, which 
would not accommodate Williams' $983,000 salary unless Williams' contract would 
be drastically restructured. 
</P>
<P>
Williams may never be a Laker, but it has been known for years that the Lakers 
like the 32-year-old center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been going on for years with the Lakers and Herb," said George Andrews, 
Williams' Chicago-based agent. "It started about 7 years ago, right before they 
drafted (James) Worthy, when there was talk that they'd trade Jamaal Wilkes for 
Herb. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when Herb was getting close to free agency (1985), there was a lot of 
talk that he'd be traded to the Lakers before he became a free agent. So, I'm 
not surprised (the rumor) has surfaced again. But this time, I haven't heard 
anything from either team." 
</P>
<P>
The problem in New York about how to use point guards Mark Jackson, last 
season's rookie of the year, and Strickland, the promising rookie, was 
temporarily solved last Thursday was Coach Rick Pitino finally bowed to public 
opinion and used both players in the same backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of an easy victory over Charlotte, Jackson switched to 
off-guard while Strickland played point guard. And everyone was happy -- except 
maybe Pitino, who had vowed that he would not make such a change. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to practice it," Pitino told Newsday. "If we're going to go with it, 
we've got to be sure. Mark's probably ready to learn the (off-guard) spot." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland, unhappy in a minor role behind Jackson, said: "I liked it out there 
with Mark. I was a little surprised, yeah. But together we can create a lot of 
easy baskets." 
</P>
<P>
It is unwise to have Karl Malone, the Utah Jazz's burly power forward, angry at 
you. Which is why Charlotte forward Kelly Tripucka tried to defuse what he 
called a misunderstanding with Malone before it escalated. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the Jazz's game at Charlotte last week, Malone read a quote 
in the Charlotte Observer, poking fun at former Utah coach Frank Layden, 
attributed to Tripucka, who had a falling out with Layden in Utah last season. 
</P>
<P>
The quote: "I heard Frank's wife made two turkeys for Thanksgiving. I don't 
know what the rest of family ate." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, such a staunch supporter of Layden that he inscribed "Frank" on the 
back of each shoe with a felt pen, scored 38 points and had 19 rebounds against 
the Hornets that night and then lashed out at Tripucka. 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't talk about someone who gave so much to the game of basketball," 
Malone told Charlotte writers. "That was a low blow. As a professional athlete, 
we should never rip another team's coach. That wasn't nice, and I didn't 
appreciate it. Kelly has to come to Utah again, and let's see what happens to 
him there." 
</P>
<P>
Tripucka pleaded not guilty to Malone's charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I never told that joke," he said. "I never said it. And I want to say, man to 
man, I apologize because that shouldn't be in paper. Don't blame that one on 
me. I hope Karl cools down." 
</P>
<P>
In that night's game, Tripucka wrote Dick on the back of his shoes, a show of 
support for Hornet Coach Dick Harter but perhaps also a jab at Malone. 
</P>
<P>
"It just goes to show I still have sense of humor," Tripucka said. 
</P>
<P>
Musician Paul Simon's video, "Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard," features 
Spud Webb as a playground nerd transformed into a dunking machine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a 9-foot rim," said the 5-foot 6-inch Webb, who dunks well on a 
regulation 10-foot basket. "It was real easy." 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Kings have offered forward Jim Petersen, reliable but not 
exactly a budding star, $6 million over 5 seasons to avoid unrestricted free 
agency after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something to be said for security and being signed before the end of 
the year," Petersen said. "But there's a lot of temptation to test the market 
and find my actual value in a system where there's no collusion." 
</P>
<P>
Don Chaney, coach of the Houston Rockets, has a new hobby -- sky diving. It 
certainly seems a less hazardous proposition than Chaney's previous hobby in 
1986, which was coaching the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've always wanted to do for a long time, ever since college," 
Chaney told a Houston writer. "It's got to be a thrill. But I have to admit I'm 
not sure why I want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's post-Clipper stress syndrome.

HE GETS BODY LIFT AT 40; 
</P>
<P>
ZEIGMAN BATTLES MIDDLE AGE, YOUNG CONANS WITH 4-YEAR TRAINING REGIMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly before he turned 40, Steve Zeigman looked in the mirror and saw a couch 
potato in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Middle age was overtaking the body that had once looked like Rambo's, that had 
been strong enough to win national weightlifting titles. There was a lot of fat 
where muscle once was. There was a lot of stomach hanging over his belt. There 
was a lot of wheezing when he walked up stairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disgusted with what I'd become," Zeigman said. "It was not 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
So Zeigman vowed to get back in shape. 
</P>
<P>
That was 16 months ago. Zeigman has redefined his body as well as his goals. 
Now he wants to make the U.S. Olympic team in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be the oldest American weightlifter in history to qualify for the 
Olympics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeigman, who will be 44 at the time of the Barcelona Olympics, is asking his 
body to respond as it never has, even when he was younger. In 1970, Zeigman, 
weighing 148, was the first American to lift double his body weight in the 
press. To make the 1992 Olympics, the 5-foot 5-inch Zeigman, now weighing 186, 
says he'll have to snatch 330 pounds and lift 420 in the clean and jerk. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no international lifters my age," Zeigman said. "It's high-level and 
intensely brutal competition." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest lifter on last year's American team was 31. So does Zeigman stand a 
chance? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think so," said Jim Schmitz, U.S. Olympic coach last year and 
president of the U.S. Weightlifting Federation, governing body of the sport. 
"As you get older, you don't get stronger. In recent years, weightlifting has 
become more of a young man's sport. You don't see 40-year-olds defeating 
30-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
But Zeigman, who lives in North Hollywood, will not be put off. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great athlete who's getting better every year," he said. "We're living 
in a scientific age. I'm applying myself in more scientific ways than other 
lifters." 
</P>
<P>
As an athletic trainer who owns his own gym, Zeigman believes that he is in a 
position to know all the latest training innovations and have time enough to 
apply them to his own body. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, Zeigman opened the Biofitness Health Center in Northridge. 
Working with several physicians, he does physical therapy and "fitness 
enhancement" on patients, but also gets in his own daily and often twice-daily 
workouts with weights. 
</P>
<P>
Zeigman unrolled a long computer printout, his training regimen. He says it's a 
pirated version of a program the Soviets developed for a 21-year-old lifter. 
</P>
<P>
"The program runs through 1992 and I'm dedicated to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeigman, who is certified as an active trainer by the American Athletic 
Trainers Assn. in Arcadia, said he will also use nutritional supplements and 
legal drugs, avoiding steroids, which are banned in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Zeigman was standing in the front room of his health center in a small shopping 
mall. On a wall were letters from people he has helped train or rehabilitate, 
including former light-heavyweight boxing champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Muzak 
was playing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no disco gym," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A potential patient called on the phone and Zeigman told him, "No matter if 
you're deconditioned or hurt, I can help you." 
</P>
<P>
Although a 5-week program costs $500, most of Zeigman's 40 patients are ordered 
into therapy by a physician and get their treatment paid for by health 
insurance. First-time patients are given a physical by a doctor and then put 
into Zeigman's care. He uses standard equipment, such as ultrasound and 
diathermy, but also has an electronic muscle stimulator that he claims 
increases strength by 20% and a climbing machine that he claims improves 
cardiac endurance by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time patients are getting healed, they're getting fit," Zeigman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hodges, a part-time aerobics instructor, was lying on a trainer's table, 
hooked up to the muscle stimulator, her thigh and stomach muscles twitching 
involuntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell I've had a workout," Hodges said, her brow sweating. 
</P>
<P>
In front of her was a television set and a VCR on which she could watch 
subliminal videotapes to build confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Zeigman uses the climber and muscle stimulator as an adjunct to his own weight 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm training harder today than I trained at 21," he said. "No one back then 
worked out 6 or 7 days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in the Washington (D.C.) area, Zeigman started lifting in high 
school, winning the teen-age nationals his senior year. In 1969, he was third 
in the U.S. national competition, then won it a year later with a lift of 301 
pounds, more than 16 pounds better than the American record. 
</P>
<P>
But then he quit because of his father's failing health "and a lot of emotional 
distress at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, to fill the "vacuum in my life," he took up the sport again, and 6 
months later qualified for the nationals. But in a workout shortly before the 
meet, he suffered a major muscle injury and wasn't able to lift for 3 years. By 
the time he was healed, he had lost his drive, or had at least misplaced it. 
</P>
<P>
"I got back into weightlifting a few months ago, not just because of the way I 
looked," Zeigman said. "There were people I defeated who went on to the 
Olympics. I'm better than they are and I don't think I'm too old to compete. A 
lot of people are going to be surprised."

IBM BUYS PIECE OF A MISSING LINK; 
</P>
<P>
THE COMPUTER GIANT'S ACQUISITION OF A STAKE IN PCO SIGNALS ITS EXPANSION INTO 
FIBER OPTICS AND COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IBM has seen the light, and it looks like it's coming from a fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, IBM, the world's largest computer maker with $54 billion in annual 
sales, disclosed that it bought a 25% stake in PCO, a tiny Chatsworth operation 
with a little more than $15 million in annual sales. The lure for IBM is that 
PCO makes equipment that is an important link between fiber-optic cables and 
equipment such as computers and telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
Fiber optics involves shooting light pulses through glass threads that are as 
thin as a human hair and as strong as a fishing line. In the past few years, 
long-distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T, GTE and MCI have been 
wiring the nation with fiber-optic cables, creating a communications highway of 
vast potential somewhat analogous to replacing a congested freeway with a 
highway several miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
Vastly more amounts of additional information can be sent through these 
fiber-optic cables than can be sent over conventional copper ones, meaning that 
one day companies should be able to effortlessly ship by cable huge amounts of 
computer data such as bank database records or an engineer's computer-aided 
design of an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
IBM already has two products that use fiber-optic technology to link computers, 
but the investment with PCO signals a bigger move into fiber optics and gives 
the computer giant a foothold in a burgeoning area of computer communications. 
</P>
<P>
PCO, a 5-year-old subsidiary of Corning Glass Works, makes "opto-electronic" 
devices that act as communication links between, for example, a fiber-optic 
line and a computer. The devices are something like electronic interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
They receive signals and pulses in one "language" -- light pulses from a 
fiber-optic line or electronic signals from a computer or telephone -- and 
"translate" the signals into the other language using a series of highly 
specialized chips so small that they resemble bits of glitter. 
</P>
<P>
For PCO, the investment from IBM gives it the stability that comes from forming 
an alliance with a partner with cavernous pockets and top research facilities 
that will most likely be a huge customer. 
</P>
<P>
"It also validates our technology, our manufacturing capability and our 
managers," said Michael K. Barnoski, PCO's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
So far, fiber optics is mainly being used to transmit long-distance telephone 
calls. But scientists envision the day when most of the nation's homes and 
businesses will be wired with fiber-optic lines, allowing for such services as 
home shopping via interactive television, or for a company to fax documents to 
another continent as quickly as a photocopy machine can copy papers today. 
</P>
<P>
PCO is also playing a role with other electronics firms in the development of 
U.S. technology for high-definition television. PCO and IBM are both among 17 
U.S. electronics firms that announced Friday that they have agreed to form a 
partnership to finance research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at IBM, PCO and Corning would not disclose how much IBM invested in 
PCO, but it reportedly is about $10 million. One IBM official noted that the 
investment is not easy to figure because some of the costs involved are 
intangible, such as IBM's commitment to assist in research. Corning also agreed 
to invest an additional, undisclosed amount in PCO. Besides IBM's 25% stake, 
Corning owns 65% of PCO, with PCO's founding executives largely owning the 
remaining 10%. 
</P>
<P>
PCO was founded as PlessCor Optronics in 1984 by Barnoski, a former research 
executive with TRW and Hughes Research, along with Corning Glass and Plessey 
Co., a British firm. In 1986 Plessey sold its interest to Corning Glass, the 
Corning, N.Y.-based conglomerate with $2 billion a year in sales. Among PCO's 
founders and current directors is Theodore H. Maiman of Santa Barbara, the man 
who built the first operating laser when he was at Hughes Aircraft Co.'s 
research laboratories in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
PCO's basic equipment can range in price from $300 to $500 and can fit in a 
person's hand. The company also assembles packages of the devices that can run 
from $2,000 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The largest customers are computer companies and the rest are bought mostly by 
telephone and defense firms. Barnoski says the company is growing at a yearly 
rate of 250% to 300%. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dulude, group president at Corning Glass Works, calls PCO a "stunning 
success." Delude downplays Corning's role in building the company, giving most 
of the credit to Barnoski. 
</P>
<P>
"It started with one guy and a handful of people," Dulude said. "What we did 
was supply the money and a lot of help when necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the company's most pressing problem now is space. Since being founded 
in 1984, it has grown to nearly 200 employees. Its parking lot is jammed and 
equipment is packed together in rooms. The company is planning to expand into a 
new building in Chatsworth soon. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has several challenges ahead if it wants to make its PCO investment pay 
off. For one thing, giant Japanese companies such as Fujitsu are already 
heavily involved in making similar devices, an annual market that 
ElectroniCast, a San Mateo market research firm, estimates at about $700 
million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, computer makers such as IBM will have to keep designing more 
powerful computers to keep up with demands created by the fiber-optic 
technology. As fiber optics allows users to send more and more information 
faster, computer makers will have to provide more sophisticated equipment to 
receive and process the data. 
</P>
<P>
Ulrich Weil, a Washington, D.C., financial consultant who follows IBM, said the 
investment is a way for IBM to make sure competitors don't proceed faster in 
the area than it does. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of an insurance premium. They don't want to be blind sided by 
someone coming up with a better mousetrap which they could have known about," 
Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., has invested in or bought companies to gain 
expertise in a new technology. IBM held a stake in Intel Corp., a Santa Clara 
semiconductor firm, from 1982 until 1987 when Intel bought back IBM's holdings. 
And in 1984 IBM bought Rolm, a Silicon Valley telephone equipment company, to 
combine computer and telephone technologies. But last month IBM said it was 
selling Rolm, which is losing money, to Siemens AG of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
James C. McGroddy, assistant general manager for IBM Technology Products who 
serves as one of 10 directors of PCO, dismissed some industry speculation that 
IBM agreed to the deal because it was having difficulty developing its own 
optoelectronic products. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have interpreted it as a kind of a gap in the technology and that 
we filled the gap with these guys. It's just a better way of doing something 
that we could have done anyway." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the deal was attractive to IBM because the three companies made a 
good fit -- Corning is a major player in developing fiber-optic technologies, 
IBM is the world's biggest computer maker and PCO has developed a strong 
reputation for its optoelectronic devices.

LABOR: UAW FACTION ERECTS ROADBLOCK TO INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disturbing counterrevolution is being mounted in the United Auto Workers 
against the union's drive toward industrial democracy. 
</P>
<P>
After 54 years as a leading force in the UAW, Victor Reuther is now a furious 
leader of the battle against the union's cautious acceptance of a plan that 
gives rank-and-file workers a significant voice in making decisions about the 
way their companies are run. 
</P>
<P>
Reuther, 77, the retired brother of the late UAW founder Walter Reuther, is not 
alone. Other present and former UAW leaders are denouncing the idea and want to 
return to the traditional adversarial relations between management and labor. 
</P>
<P>
But most officers of the 1-million-member union finally have accepted the plan 
that allows workers to join managers as decision makers. It is such a great 
idea that the counterrevolutionaries should have almost no chance of forcing 
the union to cling to the old confrontational ways that were indispensable when 
all companies struggled unceasingly to prevent unionization. 
</P>
<P>
Where industrial democracy has been tried, even on a limited scale, its success 
usually has ranged from slight to phenomenal. Total failures have been rare. 
</P>
<P>
Still, controversy swirls around it, and the next major battlefield for the 
counterrevolutionaries will be on the convention floor of the UAW convention in 
Anaheim in June when the union will elect officers and debate its future. 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents are almost certain to reelect one of their most articulate 
spokesmen, Jerry Tucker, as a regional director. They hope to add momentum to 
their cause by electing more officers to top posts, or at least get enough 
support to slow the real progress being made in democratizing the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Before the national convention battle, there will be a small but interesting 
test of the dissidents' strength. UAW members in Van Nuys will vote today for a 
new shop chairman, a top union job. 
</P>
<P>
However, the outcome will not be a clean-cut decision on the popularity of 
workplace power-sharing systems. 
</P>
<P>
True, one candidate, Paul Goldner, opposes the system. The other candidate, 
Richard Ruppert, supports it. Presumably, a victory for Ruppert would be a 
defeat for the counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
But a key factor influencing the vote could well be the failure of General 
Motors executives in Detroit to tell the Van Nuys workers everything about the 
widely rumored plan to shut down the facility soon. Many workers may vote 
against the candidate supporting industrial democracy because of their 
frustration with GM secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Mutual trust and complete honesty at all levels are essential ingredients in 
true labor-management cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the critical decision on the life or death of the jobs of 3,800 GM workers 
in Van Nuys is being made, in secret, in the executive suites in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the new power-sharing system, the Van Nuys workers already have new 
supervisorial roles and full information about the financial condition and 
productivity of the local facility. 
</P>
<P>
It will be difficult, but perhaps the workers will understand that the 
demeaning, foolish blackout imposed by top corporate executives about their 
tentative plans for Van Nuys does not invalidate the strides already made 
toward workplace democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Workers should not turn away from workplace democracy by voting for people who 
would take a step backward. Instead, it must be vigorously pursued to help 
assure the future of the Van Nuys plant and to end the undemocratic way 
executives in Detroit are dealing with issues such as plant closure. 
</P>
<P>
Potential management abuses of the system are always there. Some companies use 
minimal power-sharing as a ruse to trick employees into working harder for less 
money. Some non-union firms use it to persuade workers they don't need a union 
to protect their interests even though management actually reserves almost 
totalitarian control of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
But most UAW leaders say the need for increasing workplace democracy is so 
important that they are ready to accept the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Reuther fumes that many UAW leaders are "selling out the workers' interests for 
some illusory tidbits of power they gain for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He accuses most UAW officials of promoting the idea of workplace democracy by 
"brain-washing the members because our leaders haven't the guts to stand up and 
fight the greed of corporate America." 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas Fraser, a highly respected past UAW president, says men such as 
Victor Reuther, Tucker and other "reactionary foes of labor-management 
cooperation are prisoners of history. They are stuck in the past and see no 
alternative to the old way of just slugging it out with management." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lee, UAW Western regional director and an architect of the highly 
successful cooperative team system at the GM-Toyota plant in Fremont, Calif., 
is certain that "the old-fashioned radicals will be defeated because the old 
ways just don't work. We must watch out for management trickery, but learn to 
work cooperatively with management and work smarter, not harder." 
</P>
<P>
Reuther is convinced that men such as Lee will be "surprised as hell, by God, 
when the floodgates break and workers show they no longer trust the leaders who 
are betraying them." 
</P>
<P>
Union activist Eric Mann says the cooperative system is badly flawed because 
"the long-term interests of the working class and business class are inherently 
in opposition to each other." 
</P>
<P>
That sounds like old radical philosophy about inevitable class conflict. Of 
course, the interests of workers and owners are not identical. 
</P>
<P>
But they are not diametrically opposed, either, and new tactics and strategies 
are needed to give workers more power and a sense of dignity that they rarely 
have had before. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial democracy offers the best hope so far to achieve that admirable 
goal.

The nation's ability to produce steel will increase this year after declining 
for seven consecutive years, the American Iron and Steel Institute said. The 
industry's raw steel production capability is expected to reach 115.9 million 
tons this year, compared to 112 million tons in 1988, the low point of the 
decade. The AISI said the figure was projected from a December survey of all 
mills with furnaces for melting. The increase from 1988 to 1989 is mostly a 
result of newer and more efficient equipment. Those capital investments have 
paid off with increased yield of finished products per ton of raw steel, the 
AISI said.

ANALYSTS EXPECT MORE JOB CUTS IN FOOD INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
KRAFT TO LAY OFF 250 AS RESULT OF RECENT MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kraft Inc. said Monday that it will lay off about 250 employees during the next 
two months as a direct result of its recent merger with Philip Morris Cos. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say jobless Kraft employees could have plenty of company soon as the 
recent wave of mergers and takeovers -- such as Grand Metropolitan PLC's 
acquisition of Pillsbury and the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. purchase of 
RJR Nabisco -- in the food industry forces corporations to eliminate jobs and 
cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think that's going to be the case, with Kraft and Pillsbury being the two 
most obvious," said food industry analyst Craig Carver at Dain, Bosworth Inc., 
a Minneapolis brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Kraft layoffs, which comes about two months after the company agreed to be 
acquired by Philip Morris for $12.9 billion, is aimed at reducing costs and 
eliminating redundant staff positions, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, which makes such products as Velveeta spread, Miracle Whip and 
Philadelphia cream cheese, said the 250 layoffs will involve employees at its 
headquarters in Glenview, Ill., near Chicago and in nearby offices. The company 
employs 46,000 workers, including 2,800 in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft spokesman Gene Stevenson said no further layoffs are expected as a result 
of the merger with Philip Morris. However, he said an ongoing cost cutting 
program and "aggressive" profit goals could trigger other staff cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Productive 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Stevenson said, Kraft laid off 250 employees nationwide as a result 
of efforts to curb expenses and boost profits. "Anytime you are in a 
productivity program, that kind of thing can always happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Monday that further layoffs at Kraft will probably be 
limited to corporate staff and top managers, whose jobs are duplicated at 
Philip Morris' General Foods division. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes them a little more productive," analyst Roger W. Spencer at Paine 
Webber said of the layoffs. "That's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Philip Morris has moved much more quickly to cut staff at Kraft 
than it did four years ago when it bought General Foods, which makes such 
products as Post cereals and Jell-O desserts. 
</P>
<P>
"When they bought General Foods, the chairman of Philip Morris said they were 
going to leave it alone for two years," said John C. Maxwell Jr., food analyst 
for Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. "This time around he made no 
promises. He learned his lesson. They've been chopping away at General Foods 
for the past six months," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Job cuts at Kraft will probably spread to the other food companies that have 
been caught up in recent takeovers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell predicted that more jobs will be lost if some of RJR's divisions are 
sold, as expected, to other food companies. 
</P>
<P>
"If they get merged with another food company, I'm sure there are going to be 
some redundancies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since salaries, benefits and other associated costs can account for 70% of 
corporate expenses, it's not so surprising that takeovers often result in quick 
cutbacks in company payrolls, said Andrew K. Sherwood, president of Goodrich 
&amp; Sherwood, a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brands More Important 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood said food company managers may be even more vulnerable to layoffs than 
most executives because brand names are often the target of an acquiring 
company, not current employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The brands are more important than the people are," Sherwood said. "It really 
does not matter who is the brand manager on Hellman's mayonnaise. You can find 
someone else who is a good brand manager. But you can't find another Hellman's 
mayonnaise."

SHAMROCK TO PURCHASE 2ND MUSIC STORE CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrock Holdings, a Burbank investment firm owned by the family of Roy E. 
Disney, announced Monday that it agreed to pay $132.5 million for a Dallas 
chain of video and music stores. 
</P>
<P>
The $25.65-a-share acquisition of Sound Warehouse, which has 121 stores in 14 
states, marks the second purchase of a music and video chain by Shamrock in one 
year. Last April, Shamrock paid an undisclosed price for the 60-store Music 
Plus chain in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Plus acquisition followed an unsuccessful bid by Shamrock to buy 
still another music and video chain, Wherehouse Entertainment in Torrance, 
which sold for $118 million in December, 1987, to the New York investment firm 
Adler &amp; Shaykin. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shamrock is continuing a hostile bid to buy Polaroid Corp., but its 
$2.4-billion offer for the instant photography giant received a setback last 
month. A Delaware Chancery Court ruling upheld a Polaroid employee stock plan 
that makes it difficult for Shamrock to buy Polaroid. Shamrock is appealing the 
decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended last May 31, Sound Warehouse earned $4.2 million on sales of 
$181 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sound Warehouse's stock fell from about $30 a share in 1986 to about $10 a 
share last spring. Dennis Telzrow, a securities analyst with the Eppler Guerin 
&amp; Turner brokerage in Dallas, said the company has been hurt by the 
economic slump caused by soft oil prices in Texas, where Sound Warehouse has 
half of its stores. 
</P>
<P>
The price paid by Shamrock is expected to also include a special dividend for 
Sound Warehouse shareholders of up to 10 cents a share, depending on what it 
costs to close the acquisition, which is expected to be approved by 
shareholders in April. Sound Warehouse's stock closed at $24.625 a share in 
over-the-counter trading Monday, up $2.625. 
</P>
<P>
Mark S. Siegel, a Shamrock executive vice president, said the Sound Warehouse 
acquisition is part of Shamrock's goal to be a top seller of home entertainment 
products such as music and videocassettes. Siegel said that it also is part of 
a consolidation going on in the retail video and music industry. 
</P>
<P>
Besides music and video stores, Shamrock owns three televisions stations, 15 
radio stations and has interests in energy, real estate and ranching. Roy E. 
Disney also serves as vice chairman of Walt Disney Co. in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, another music and video chain sale was disclosed Monday by LIVE 
Entertainment in Newbury Park. It agreed to buy for an undisclosed price 
Beckzack Corp., owner of the Strawberries chain in Milford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE is the holding company for International Video Entertainment, which 
produces and distributes movies, and for Lieberman Enterprises, which 
distributes videocassettes and music to large stores. Strawberries, which has 
79 stores in New England, upstate New York and the Philadelphia area, had $60 
million in sales last year.

DAMON OKS $223-MILLION BID FROM INVESTOR GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damon Corp. on Monday accepted a $223-million takeover offer from a group led 
by American Magnetics Corp. in Sherman Oaks, apparently ending Damon's 
seven-month battle to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
However, the companies' agreement also allows Damon, a Needham Heights, 
Mass.-based operator of clinical laboratories, to solicit other offers for 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The American Magnetics group, called Nomad Partners, also includes Ballantrae 
Partners, an investment partnership led by Robert L. Rosen and Glen M. Kassan, 
chairman and executive vice president of American Magnetics, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
American Magnetics makes optical-character recognition equipment, the machines 
used to scan credit card data at store checkout counters and the devices inside 
automated teller machines that read customers' bank cards. The company earned 
$353,000 on sales of $11.8 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement with Nomad, which already owns 1.03 million, or 11%, of 
Damon's 9.6 million shares outstanding, was approved by Damon's directors but 
remains subject to approval by its stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking the helm at American Magnetics in 1987, Rosen has led moves to 
diversify. Damon is one of the last major independent laboratory chains, and, 
excluding its troubled biotechnology unit, its laboratory business is 
profitable. Rosen sees its stock as relatively undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Nomad would pay $26 in cash for each of the Damon shares 
it does not already own. Damon shareholders also would get 50% of any after-tax 
cash from the sale of Damon's 61% ownership of Damon Biotech Inc., a 
biotechnology company that is publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old biotechnology venture has been a drain on Damon's profits, and 
Damon had previously proposed spinning it off to its shareholders. (In its 
fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1988, Damon earned $8.2 million on revenue of $208.2 
million.) But the company said Monday that there would be no such spinoff if 
the Nomad merger goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Nomad also had promised to shed Damon Biotech, and its previous offer to buy 
Damon had called for Damon's stockholders to receive $24 in cash and 1.3 shares 
of Damon's interest in Damon Biotech for each of their existing shares. Now, if 
the merger goes through, stockholders would apparently receive cash from the 
sale of Damon's stake in Damon Biotech.

The European Community Commission has begun an inquiry into imports of 
Asian-made audio cassette tapes, which are allegedly being sold in the 
12-nation trade bloc at below market prices. The commission opened the probe 
after receiving a complaint from the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers 
Federations on behalf of European producers of audio tapes. The complaint 
alleges that imports from Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong rose 23% between 
1984 and 1987 and that the three countries' share of the European market had 
climbed to 71%. The complaint also alleges that the Asian tapes were 
undercutting prices charged by European producers by up to 28.5%.

General Motors Corp., following the lead of Ford Motor Co., said it will offer 
4.9% financing on two-year loans for 1988 and 1989 S/T-15 pickups. Also 
available are rates ranging from 6.9% on loans of three years to 9.9% on loans 
of five years. In lieu of the cut-rate financing, GM said buyers can receive 
rebates of $500-$750 on the truck, depending on the type of transmission. GM 
also said it is offering rebates of $500-$600 on its compact Jimmy utility 
vehicles, C/K Sierra pickup trucks and R/V full-sized trucks. The program began 
Monday and expires March 6.

Prices for future deliveries of corn, oats and soybeans plunged their permitted 
daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report 
showed larger supplies of corn and soybeans than most experts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, energy futures surged, livestock and meat futures declined, 
copper was sharply higher, precious metals were mixed and stock index futures 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 10.25 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in March at $4.3075 a bushel; corn was 10 cents lower across the 
board, with March at $2.7825 a bushel; oats were 9 cents to 10 cents lower, 
with March at $2.33 a bushel, and soybeans were 19 cents to 37 cents lower, 
with January at $7.6675 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board of Trade limits corn and oat futures to daily moves of 10 
cents a bushel, wheat to 20 cents a bushel and soybeans to 30 cents a bushel. 
The limit on the January soybean contract has been lifted pending the 
contract's expiration. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they had expected the sharp declines, especially in the corn 
market, in reaction to an Agriculture Department crop report released after the 
close of trading on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The report's final 1988 U.S. corn production figure -- 4.92 billion bushels -- 
was nearly 6% higher than the average estimate of market analysts and more than 
5% above the USDA's last projection, which it made in November. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA pegged the nation's corn stockpile as of Dec. 1 at 7.07 billion 
bushels, more than 6% higher than the average pre-report estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The government's numbers for soybean production and soybean stocks also were 
higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA's wheat numbers were considered bullish but analysts said the corn and 
soybean markets pulled down wheat prices for near-month delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop in prices may force some corn producers to reconsider their 
strategies for the new growing season, said Cathy Leow, a grain market analyst 
with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
She said corn's recent rise to levels near $2.80 a bushel may have prompted 
some farmers to consider dropping out of the government's price-support 
program, in which they agree to limit their corn acreage in return for a 
guaranteed selling price. 
</P>
<P>
But now, she said, "I think a lot of them will think twice about dropping out 
of the program, given current price levels. It will affect planting decisions 
but we don't know how much." 
</P>
<P>
Oil futures prices surged to their highest levels since November, 1987, pumped 
up by market speculation that OPEC nations would be able to keep a cap on their 
output. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they did not expect the spike in prices to have much effect on 
prices of home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasted for a considerable 
period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. 
crude oil, jumped 40 cents to settle at $18.88 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the near-month contract settled higher was Nov. 20, 1987, amid 
hostilities in the Persian Gulf in the Iran-Iraq war. It settled that day at 
$18.93. 
</P>
<P>
Although Persian Gulf troubles no longer are an issue, the price of the 
near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate has soared 50% since an 
intra-day low of $12.28 a barrel on Oct. 5.

The dollar strengthened against all key currencies in quiet holiday trading 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver prices fell, with silver dipping to its lowest level in nearly 
22 months in London. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Giammattei, a currency trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said 
near-term sentiment toward the dollar remained somewhat bullish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a growing feeling in the market that the United States doesn't 
really mind seeing a higher dollar at this time," Giammattei explained. "A 
higher dollar helps take inflationary pressure off of us by making imports 
cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the dollar also was boosted by reduced chances for central bank 
intervention from the United States and Japan because of holidays there. Many 
U.S. traders were absent from the market in observance of the late Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s birthday, a federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7615 late Monday from $1.7770 on 
Friday. Sterling fetched $1.7610 in New York, down from $1.7660 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell to 
$402.20 an ounce from $402.30 on Friday. Later, Republic National Bank in New 
York quoted gold bullion at a bid of $401.80 as of 4 p.m. EST, down from 
$402.30. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices rose in New York after falling in London. On New York's Comex, 
silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.890 an ounce from $5.888 on 
Friday.

Wall Street's blue chip index ended a three-day rally Monday, while the broader 
market gained in lackluster trading ahead of Wednesday's report on the November 
U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had gained ground in seven of the 
eight preceding sessions, slipped 1.43 to 2,224.64. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with Big Board volume falling to 117.38 
million shares from Friday's 132.32 million 
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose early to a high of 2,231.61 and stayed locked within a 10-point 
range. Stocks could not make much headway in the muted market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Trading had been expected to be light because of the absence of many investors 
taking a holiday in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the mood of the markets had been brightening gradually as the 
rally in stock prices that began last November continued into the new year. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, several primary indicators of market trends stood at 
their highest levels since the crash in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, brokers said some traders were selling Monday to cash in on those 
gains. Many Wall Streeters worry that the rally cannot make much more progress 
unless interest rates turn downward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investors Cautious 
</P>
<P>
"There was no news to move the market and it lacked carry-over momentum to push 
stocks one way or the other," said strategist Rao Chalasani at Prescott Ball 
&amp; Turben Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to be waiting for the shoe to drop," said Gruntal &amp; Co.'s 
director of technical research, Gene Jay Seagle. "We're continually testing the 
problem, whether it's (high) interest rates, or the trade figure. That creates 
a dull market." 
</P>
<P>
Another question mark in many minds is the government's impending monthly 
report Wednesday on the nation's position in international trade. 
</P>
<P>
Advance estimates at leading brokerage houses generally call for the U.S. trade 
deficit to widen for November to $11 billion or more from the $10.3-billion gap 
reported for October. 
</P>
<P>
In the action that did take place Monday, takeover news and rumors provided the 
dominant theme. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, corporate and municipal bond prices were little changed 
in quiet holiday trading. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic Treasury bond market was closed for the holiday, but in London, 
U.S. government issues traded slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures price movements 
on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.01 to 
296.75. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal bonds edged higher. The Bond Buyer index of 40 long-term bonds was up 
1/16 to 92 5/32. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aids Other Issues 
</P>
<P>
Among takeover issues, Texas Eastern Corp. shares jumped 14 3/4 to 45 on volume 
of 7.2 million shares. Coastal Corp., whose stock fell 3/4 to 34 1/8, said it 
will begin a $42-a-share tender for the gas pipeline company today. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Eastern's rise helped other pipeline stocks as well. Transco Energy Co. 
advanced 1 1/4 to 36 1/8, Panhandle Eastern Corp. gained 1 to 26 1/2 and 
Enserch Corp. added 3/8 to 19 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of Rockingham Bancorp almost doubled, soaring 6 7/8 to 14 5/8 on news 
that Eastern Bancorp agreed to buy the New Hampshire thrift for $17.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines' parent UAL Corp. rose 1 5/8 to 112 5/8. UAL said the rise was 
related to a press report that investor Saul Steinberg may have acquired almost 
5% of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Sound Warehouse advanced 2 5/8 to 24 5/8. The Dallas-based home entertainment 
retailer signed an agreement to merge with Shamrock Holdings Inc. for $25.65 a 
share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines rose 7/8 to 124 1/4 in anticipation that the 
company will report stronger fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, share prices finished higher Monday but below their session 
peaks on the London Stock Exchange, buoyed by more signs that recent rises in 
British interest rates are starting to curb consumer spending. The Financial 
Times 100-share index rose 9.7 to 1,871.8. It had been up 15 points earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday.

A SEXIER WAY TO EDUCATE TEEN-AGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a state with a population of just 700,000, about 47,000 in-state telephone 
calls -- many of them presumably from young men -- have flooded a Delaware 
number that offers frank talk about sex. 
</P>
<P>
But state officials aren't in an uproar, and, in fact, are pleased by the heavy 
traffic on the toll-free "In Touch" line, which offers advice on such topics as 
"How to Score." 
</P>
<P>
That's because it is part of an innovative program by the Delaware Division of 
Public Health to educate what has been the toughest to reach and most poorly 
informed group on human sexuality: teen-age males. 
</P>
<P>
With posters and brochures, health officials have tried to entice teens to call 
"In Touch" to listen to 50 tapes with such titles as "How to Score," "How to 
Say 'No,' " "Big Muscles and Manhood," and "What She Would Tell You If She 
Could." 
</P>
<P>
So just what do callers hear? 
</P>
<P>
After punching in a code for "How to Score," for example, a man's voice tells 
them: "You want to get lucky, right? You want to get what you want. If you're a 
man, you want to get a little . . . from whomever OK? You know what that means. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"We interviewed some incredible studs on this one and here's what they said: 
One said he held off (having sex) because he learned -- correctly, by the way 
-- that, if you try to make love under pressure and you don't know what you're 
doing, it's usually not very satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
"Another said he took care of his urges by himself. Not a bad idea, by the way. 
And he kept on having great fantasies and really enjoying them, without acting 
on them." 
</P>
<P>
That message might not have been exactly what some callers might have expected, 
especially based on the tape's title. 
</P>
<P>
But "if we came up with very clinical titles, the kids wouldn't be interested," 
said Lucille Siegel, director of Delaware's Office of Adolescent Health 
Services. "What we tried to do is come up with titles to the messages that 
would encourage kids to call up and listen. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's going to tell them how to go find a boyfriend or a girlfriend. 
In fact, it gets into things related to peer pressure and issues like whether 
you have to have a lover or a sex partner to be cool and accepted." 
</P>
<P>
That the "In Touch" line has become so popular since it began in 1986 -- it now 
receives nine calls an hour on weekdays in the peak period from just after 
school ends until dinner time -- has attracted national attention. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel, who recently published a brief essay describing the program in the 
American Journal of Public Health, said her agency has received inquiries about 
it from agencies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Siegel and Planned Parenthood chapter officials nationwide said it is 
frustrating trying to educate teen-age males, because the American ethic 
requires them to pretend to friends and peers that they know about sex, and 
that they are experienced with it. 
</P>
<P>
The privacy of the call-in service -- which can be reached only by callers in 
Delaware -- allows teen-agers to maintain appearances for their peers while 
still providing them accurate information they can relate to, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Funds 
</P>
<P>
The program -- funded by a federal grant that pays for the phone machinery, 
production of tapes and a statewide advertising and promotion campaign linked 
to high school sex education courses -- had its genesis in a similar service 
once run by the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood chapter, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
That program, which a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said went out of existence 
six years ago, was less extensive. Baltimore's Planned Parenthood -- as well as 
chapters in San Diego and Marin County and at least one county health 
department in Virginia -- have run similar programs, though none as explicit as 
Delaware's. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Delaware tapes are explicit, they are carefully crafted. They are 
reviewed by a panel of several dozen representatives of church and community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 50 tapes focuses on abortion -- a recognition that that topic, 
especially for a public agency, is too controversial for the call-in format. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its format, statistical records can't determine the sex of the 
callers. But 42% of the callers, who push buttons to ask for specific tapes, 
requested selections designed for a male audience; 35% of the callers requested 
tapes on female-oriented topics; and 23% heard tapes considered "gender 
neutral." 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive local media publicity about the program, there have been no 
complaints about it from any group, said Barbara Ryan, director of education 
for Planned Parenthood of Delaware, the agency which houses the "In Touch" 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
The service, Ryan said, must be filling a large, unmet need because the machine 
"is going all the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Health Messages 
</P>
<P>
"How to Score" is the most popular selection, and it, like the other messages, 
contains a carefully structured, classical series of public health messages. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to thinly veiled references to sex, seduction and masturbation, 
"How to Score," for example, also advises about: effective birth control; 
religious and other concerns about sex, masturbation and sex among unmarried 
teens; and the importance of caring, communicative relationships over sexual 
flings. 
</P>
<P>
It closes with a quiz on responsible sex and ends with the male voice 
observing: "So how did you score? Or, how important is scoring to you? Unless 
you scored well on this little quiz, you may need some work before you get 
lucky. If not, you may be just very unlucky and your partner may be, too."

IF THE DINOSAURS HAD SURVIVED . . .

<P>
The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution by Dougal Dixon (Salem House: 
$19.95; 120 pages; illustrated) 
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen much discussion in scholarly and popular circles about 
what happened to the dinosaurs. After ruling the Earth for 150 million years, 
those spectacular reptiles suddenly became extinct 65 million years ago. 
Current speculation centers on some cataclysmic event, such as the Earth being 
hit by a comet, to explain their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dougal Dixon, a British paleontologist and science writer, wonders about a 
different question altogether. What if the comet had missed? he muses. What if 
the dinosaurs had not become extinct but had continued to flourish, evolve and 
dominate the planet? What would today's dinosaurs be like? 
</P>
<P>
The result of this speculation is an engaging, thoroughly enjoyable, 
almost-believable book, "The New Dinosaurs," which strictly applies the 
principles of evolution to the creation of an imaginary zoo. Starting with the 
idea that climate and environment are the deciding factors in how living things 
evolve, Dixon charts the changes on the Earth's surface since the dinosaurs 
died out and then invents critters to fill all environmental niches. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wonderful idea wonderfully carried out, and the pictures of these 
would-have-been creatures are as good as the text. 
</P>
<P>
Here we meet the balaclav (whose name is almost an anagram of a Greek pastry), 
a ferocious-looking beast that inhabits mountain snowfields and ekes out a 
living on alpine plants. To protect itself from the cold, the balaclav contains 
layers of fat and is covered by hair. 
</P>
<P>
The megalosaur, on the other hand, lives in tropical rain forests and offshore 
islands. "Its sharp teeth and the powerful claws on the forelimbs are used for 
holding prey and tearing it up," Dixon writes. "The actual killing is done with 
great talons on the hind feet. As it walks the heavy head is held out at the 
front, balanced by the long heavy tail behind." 
</P>
<P>
The dingum, meanwhile, is a meat-eating desert creature with a remarkable 
anatomical trait. When a predator appears, "A fin of skin supported by struts 
of bone springs up from its curved back and presents a gaudily colored sail to 
the attacker, a sudden burst of garish color against the drab grasses. The 
crest on the back of the head pops up a frill of spines, each one poisonous 
enough to kill a large attacker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beast of the Steppes 
</P>
<P>
And don't overlook the taranter, a grass-eating beast of the steppes whose back 
is covered with horny bone plates. This armor originally evolved for defense, 
but in the taranter, it serves the more important purpose of helping the animal 
conserve moisture. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dixon's assumptions is that because the dinosaurs didn't die out, there 
was no evolution of mammals from the small, rat-like creatures they were during 
the Age of the Reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
All science-fiction movies to the contrary, cavemen did not exist at the time 
of the dinosaurs. They came much, much later, after the dinosaurs had 
relinquished the planet. In Dixon's imagined evolution, neither cavemen nor 
anything close to them ever got started. The highest mammal in Dixon's world is 
a zwim, which is about a foot long, looks like a cross between a shrew and a 
beaver, lives in streams and rivers and dines on insects. There are no primates 
in Dixon's hypothetical world, and certainly no humans. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any sign of intelligence, at least in our understanding of that 
term. The animals that Dixon envisions all live by instinct and evolutionary 
design. Might intelligence not have evolved in creatures other than humans? 
Just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alternative Zoology' 
</P>
<P>
"The New Dinosaurs" is Dixon's second book of "alternative zoology." The first 
was "After Man," which imagined how evolution was going to proceed in the 
future. "The New Dinosaurs" wonders how evolution would have occurred up to now 
with one large change along the way. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the books so compelling is that they are not mere flights of fancy 
cooked up in a dream. Starting with what is known about the dinosaurs that did 
exist and hewing to the rules of evolution, Dixon comes up with plausible 
creatures that might actually be roaming around today in place of you and me. 
It's a pleasant and provocative way to learn about dinosaurs and about 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for us, the comet (or whatever it was) didn't miss, the great 
reptiles did die out, the mammals did evolve, and here we are thinking about 
all these things. But it could have been otherwise.

YOUR BODY: EMERGENCY ROOMS PREP FOR SUPER BOWL SYNDROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's called "Super Bowl syndrome." And, not coincidentally, emergency room 
physicians expect the next onslaught late Sunday afternoon, about the time the 
Bengals and 49ers conclude their game. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that hospital emergency rooms may not have a television -- or that it 
might not be tuned to the all-important game -- some rabid football fans delay 
seeking medical attention for colds, flu and even chest pain, until the 
post-game wrap-up, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of patients at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in 
Santa Monica is expected to rise from a handful to 20 or 30 within an hour 
after the Super Bowl concludes, said Dr. Alexander Lampone, director of the 
emergency department. "When the game ends, everyone who had a problem shows 
up," said Lampone, who has witnessed a number of such post-Super Bowl rushes. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chris Fagan, director of Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital's emergency room, 
has observed the same phenomenon: "People come in with chest pain and say, 'I 
decided to finish watching the game and then come in (to the hospital)." 
</P>
<P>
The stress of a game can aggravate a problem, Lampone warned, and "contribute 
to chest pain in someone susceptible." If you have serious symptoms, videotape 
the game and get to the hospital, the doctors advise. And don't overdo eating 
and drinking during the game, they add. Doing so can make symptoms -- such as 
chest pain -- worse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Ear Infections 
</P>
<P>
Frequent ear infections during a child's first 18 months of life can lead to 
lack of language skills, and exposure to cigarette smoke may increase the risk 
of such ear problems, two new studies conclude. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 420 children, ages 6 months to 36 months, University of Texas 
researchers Terese Finitzo and Sandy Friel-Patti found children with chronic 
middle-ear infections (otitis media) are more likely to have language problems. 
About a third of U.S. children have more than three ear infections by the age 
of 3, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck 
Surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Mild fluctuating intermittent hearing loss (which can accompany otitis media) 
does have an effect on language," said the researchers who presented their 
findings Monday in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science. "The more otitis media, the lower the language skills," 
Finitzo said. "We did not always see a clinical delay in language, but we did 
see differences between kids with ear infections and those without ear 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated survey, Utah researchers found a higher likelihood of 
middle-ear effusion, an accumulation of fluid behind the eardrum, as exposure 
to cigarette smoke increased. Middle-ear effusion can lead to otitis media, 
said Dr. Barbara D. Reed, an assistant professor of family and preventive 
medicine at the University of Utah School of Medicine, who reported the study 
recently with co-researcher Dr. Lawrence Lutz in the journal Family Medicine. 
Previous studies have linked exposure to cigarette smoke with upper-respiratory 
infections in children, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how cigarette smoke affects the ears isn't known, but Reed speculates 
cigarette smoke irritants "may cause an inflammatory or allergic reaction, 
impairing the functioning of the Eustachian tube, which is responsible for 
clearing the fluid from behind the eardrum. 
</P>
<P>
"If you must smoke," she said, "don't do so indoors or around your child." 
</P>

Fish Meets Chicken 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like fish but don't want to miss out on the potentially healthy 
effects of its Omega-3 fatty acids, consider the "super chicken," poultry fed a 
diet rich in these fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
A grain mixture containing 8% to 12% fish meal could produce birds with Omega-3 
fatty acid levels comparable to those of fish and shellfish, claims Howard 
Hulan, professor and head of the poultry science department at Oregon State 
University in Corvallis. The Omega-3 family of fatty acids, components of fish 
oils that are polyunsaturated, are commonly found in mackerel, herring, salmon 
and sardines. 
</P>
<P>
Consuming foods rich in key fatty acids may help protect against heart disease, 
Hulan and others believe. Eating meat with this fatty acids supplies the energy 
of animal fats without boosting cholesterol to levels that increase risk of 
heart disease, Hulan said. 
</P>
<P>
In taste tests of the super chicken, not yet available, respondents detected no 
fishy taste in poultry fed a meal consisting of dried and ground-up by-products 
-- heads, bones and innards, the researcher added. 
</P>
<P>
Joann Hattner, a clinical dietitian at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, 
said raising the level of Omega-3 fatty acids in chicken feed does not 
necessarily mean that eating this special variety of chicken will be as 
beneficial as eating fish. "There may be other components in fish in addition 
to the Omega-3 that make them so healthy to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Americans consume more poultry than fish, according to U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. In 1987, per capita consumption of poultry was nearly 80 pounds, 
compared with 15 pounds of fish.

Hot News on Colds 
</P>
<P>
If you're taking cold medications, there are important facts to consider, 
experts say. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drinking alcohol can increase the sedative effects of the medication, said 
Edwin Webb, a pharmacist and spokesman for the American Pharmaceutical Assn., 
the Washington-based national society for pharmacists. "And some liquid cold 
products contain alcohol to make the medication easier to take." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cold sufferers under treatment for high blood pressure should always 
consult their physician before taking any cold product containing a 
decongestant (such as phenylpropanolamine)," said Robert T. Koda, USC associate 
professor of pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cold medications stay in the body longer than most people think. "With 
sustained release cold medicine, the medication's effects can last 8 to 12 
hours from a single dose," Koda said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consumers who regularly take aspirin or acetaminophen should be aware that 
some cold medications contain those analgesics as well.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE CONTROVERSY, THE PERSONAL STORIES OF TWO WHO MADE TOUGH 
CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robin Schneider had an abortion when she was 17. Jill Lodato was 19 when she 
had the first of two abortions. 
</P>
<P>
For Schneider, now 28, an abortion was a guilt-free act that allowed her to get 
on with life. 
</P>
<P>
Lodato, now 26, however, found herself sliding into despondency after the 
second abortion, walling herself off from other people and even from herself. 
</P>
<P>
Their sharply divergent views represent two sides of a controversy whose 
scientific basis is under question: What are the psychological consequences of 
abortion? 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as part of the escalating furor over the issue, Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop reported that "at this time, the available scientific evidence 
about the psychological (effects) of abortion simply cannot support either the 
preconceived beliefs of those pro-life or pro-choice." Nevertheless, abortion 
foe Koop said he knows "lots of people who've had trouble with abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Koop's personal response was indicative of the strong feelings surrounding 
abortion's psychological impact. For many, it is an article of faith that an 
abortion can ignite long-term emotional responses that are always painful and 
sometimes crippling. That belief is so strong that groups such as Women 
Exploited by Abortion have been founded to console and counsel those who regret 
their abortions. 
</P>
<P>
For others, the anguish is chimerical, an elaborate propaganda device concocted 
out of the desire to exploit women for political and social ends. 
</P>
<P>
But to women like Lodato and Schneider, who are both unmarried, abortion is not 
an episodic news event. Their personal stories and their professional lives 
demonstrate the depths of conviction and commitment that drive the abortion 
controversy between peaks of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
As executive director of the California Abortion Rights Action League's 
southern branch, Schneider adamantly believes that the psychological 
consequences of abortion are positive. The principal post-abortion emotion is 
relief, she maintains. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, whose activism in women's issues dates to a junior high school 
debate over girls playing Little League baseball, says there have been no 
aftershocks because of her abortion -- "None at all and it's been 10 years now. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways," she added, "it was one of the first really responsible 
decisions I made. I think for many teen-agers and younger women that's how it 
is. . . . Not that going through parenthood can't be a responsible decision 
also. But I firmly believe that deciding to have an abortion can be an 
extremely responsible, moral decision." 
</P>
<P>
While she "didn't consider even for a minute having the baby," Schneider said 
that her abortion was not entirely free of feelings: "You have a lot of 
emotions. But the emotion, I think, is mostly around the issues of women and 
sexuality, especially teen-age women and sexuality and feeling like 'Why didn't 
I have it together enough to get birth control?' 
</P>
<P>
"But I had no idea even then what birth control was, what were the methods. So 
it was more feelings around initiating sexual intercourse -- not that I 
initiated it -- and confusion about what is this new experience? What role is 
it going to play in my life?" 
</P>
<P>
Schneider believes that "in some ways my case is kind of the typical case of an 
American teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
"I had never had sex education in school," she said. "My parents had never 
talked to me about sex or birth control." 
</P>
<P>
With her stepmother's help, Schneider said she found a clinic and "had the 
abortion and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, Lodato, who became pregnant a second time even though she 
took birth control pills, said that five years after her second abortion, she 
still has bouts of emotional pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I feel that from about six months ago, I've completely forgiven 
myself for what I've done," said Lodato, a full-time staffer at a Mission Viejo 
pregnancy counseling clinic that discourages abortion and sponsors support 
groups for women who have had abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"I've forgiven those who were a part of it that I was angry with. I've 
definitely accepted God's forgiveness but I'm still sorrowful and I still cry 
over it." 
</P>
<P>
Her first pregnancy seemingly was less disruptive than her second, she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that it was something that I just had to get rid of," she said. "I come 
from a real success-oriented family, and I felt like I couldn't do this to my 
family, or my friends, or my sorority, or me, or anything. I never thought 
anything bothered me except I lost a lot of weight really quick." 
</P>
<P>
Her second pregnancy was a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I was determined to have the baby, but everyone in the world 
was telling me to have an abortion," she said. "I knew that I was making the 
decision to abort because of the pressure from other people. . . . When I was 
driving home from the abortion clinic, I just knew that I not only ended a 
problem but I ended the life of the baby and it really, really killed me." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers the struggle to find support for bearing a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my day of reckoning one evening before I had the second abortion," she 
said. "I called my parents. I woke up just sweating and just realizing that I 
could not go through with the abortion and I wanted someone to reach out and 
say, 'It's OK, you don't have to have the abortion.' . . . No one in my world 
was telling me abortion might not be a good alternative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guilt Whiplash Expected 
</P>
<P>
This whiplash of guilt, isolation and regret is exactly what Koop had expected 
to find when he was sent by President Reagan on a mission to document 
abortion's presumed mental hurts. The outgoing President's advisers apparently 
were certain that overwhelming evidence to support their views would be found, 
said Koop, who acknowledged such findings would be used to reverse the 1973 
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But Koop's announcement that further study was needed came the same day that 
the Supreme Court said it would consider a Missouri case that might allow it to 
modify its 16-year-old ruling in Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
These two events -- as well as large, widespread anti-abortion demonstrations 
in the last few days -- mark a dramatic intensification of this country's 
long-running and angry debate over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider says Koop's failure to find evidence supporting anti-abortion forces 
was welcomed by her and others fighting to maintain women's rights to legal, 
safe abortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Find Evidence 
</P>
<P>
"I think if he (Koop) could have proved it, he definitely would have written a 
report" that abortion is psychologically harmful, Schneider said. "He's had an 
anti-abortion agenda since before he was put in that office. So in some ways we 
were very pleased because he couldn't come up with the evidence and that he 
wasn't willing to put his good name as a scientist on reports that had been 
based on false information." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lodato is equally convinced that, like her, many women 
suffer serious psychological problems because of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But she concedes that the psychological harm of abortion is "hard to document" 
because women often aren't able to pinpoint the source of their depression or 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
Women who seek counseling, she explained, ". . . don't go and say, 'Well, I 
know that I'm depressed and that I'm having problems with my marriage and I'm 
frustrated with my child or whatever's going on because of an abortion I had 
five years ago, or 10 or 20.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outsiders See Trouble 
</P>
<P>
Rather, she said, the source of inner turmoil is more often identified by 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the women who get involved in our post-abortion support group did not 
call us just because they felt these feelings and called us," Lodato said. 
"They heard me at a church group talking about our support group or they heard 
someone else. Once they've heard about it, they might think, 'Well, maybe 
that's what it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
In her own case, it took a long time to uncover all the emotions related to her 
abortions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lodato, who wants to eventually be a high school teacher, believes that her 
work at the pregnancy center is a higher calling, one she came to after finding 
comfort from Living Alternatives, the ministry that sponsors the center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
God's Calling 
</P>
<P>
"This might sound weird, but I really feel this is where God wants me to be 
right now," she explained. "The day I really feel God wants me to go on to 
something else I will." She added that the ministry supporting her clinic 
steers away from the political arena and avoids picketing and "writing letters 
to politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Lodato believes that the most important thing she can do is not to campaign 
publicly against abortion but to encourage youngsters to "wait until marriage, 
to say no to sex." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider is convinced that clinics such as the one where Lodato works are 
"bogus" operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that most of the people who regret their abortion decision enough to 
be anti-choice are involved with a religious organization or other 
organizations whose main purpose is to make women feel ashamed and guilty about 
having an abortion, or contemplating getting one," she said. "If you surround 
yourself with people who think abortion is evil, it's pretty easy to feel 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Plans for Her Life 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, who was a senior in high school with plans for college when she had 
the abortion, said: "I was lucky in that I had something to look forward to . . 
. and I wanted to change the world and I was not going to change the world as a 
single mother." 
</P>
<P>
Yet abortion has been divisive within her own family, said Schneider, who was 
raised Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandmother is still a devout Catholic and she doesn't want to discuss this 
issue, she doesn't want to ask me, 'How's work, Robin?' In fact, the last time 
I was in a Catholic church . . . they started talking about going down to 
Washington to march against abortion and I walked out of the church. I was not 
going to sit there and take this kind of anti-choice propaganda. It was pretty 
clear that it was a statement, I think, and my grandmother was not pleased."

KRONOS IN MULTIMEDIA PREMIERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trust the Kronos Quartet for the unusual. The veteran ensemble, which has been 
reordering the way we think about string quartet performance for the better 
part of two decades, has been moving in ever more theatrical directions. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday the latest Kronos adventure into media mixing received its local 
premiere at the Wadsworth Theater, courtesy of the UCLA Center for the 
Performing Arts, one member of a commissioning sextet. A sculptural performance 
shell based on the four elements, "Assembly Required" certainly could not 
transmute musical lead into dramatic gold. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it did not debase the four works it sheltered Sunday. 
Alessandro Moruzzi's design, moodily lit by Jack Carpenter, proved surprisingly 
neutral in impact. 
</P>
<P>
Most effective was the Fire installment, framing Donald Crockett's "Array." 
There was nothing particularly stirring in the dull glow emanating from four 
burners on tripods, but the projection of the players' shadows on screens -- an 
idea at least as old as "Fantasia" -- proved evocative of flickering energy. 
</P>
<P>
Most trivial was the final Air segment, in which fluorescent squiggles dangled 
from poles behind the ensemble. There is much in the textures and 
quasi-aleatoric spirit of Lutoslawski's Quartet to suggest air, but Moruzzi's 
devices seemed more suggestive of glowing bats in a low-budget fun house than 
any mystical experience. 
</P>
<P>
For Water, Moruzzi had Kronos place funnels of water over a plexiglass 
container, with shadows of the filling tank again projected behind the group. 
Earth may have been most representative of the effort -- angular rods on which 
non-functional gears spun intermittently, ultimately doing nothing -- but doing 
it quite enigmatically. 
</P>
<P>
Credits for the production listed Jan Kirsch as choreography and movement 
coach, and she took bows with Moruzzi. Her contribution though, was invisible. 
Dressed in black, like stage hands, Kronos put together the sculptural 
components as a solemn, well-practiced but dramatically and technically 
unexceptional ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the Kronos performance proved typically rapt, though coarsely 
amplified, with a steady hum that could be heard in quiet moments throughout 
the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Array," the program's most traditional work in materials and construction, 
thrived in the Fire environment. Crockett's vigorous, skillfully controlled 
motivic manipulations elicited taut, focused playing. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing noticeably watery about "Pano da Costa" by Jon Hassell, and if 
the dripping of the water in Moruzzi's design was meant to be audible, that 
failed completely. Instead, "Pano da Costa" is an extended exercise in haunting 
neo-ethnic bravura, a sort of village tone poem enlisting the rhythmic aid of 
caxixi, instruments that sound like maracas. 
</P>
<P>
John Zorn's "Cat O' Nine Tails" is a sonic crazy quilt of bursts of scratchy 
instrumental competition, varied quotations and pop parodies that seems little 
more than a "Name That Tune" ordeal. Its relationship to earth was not 
immediately apparent, though it made a relevant connection to Moruzzi's 
contraption idly spinning its wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Lutoslawski's expressive, intuitively directed Quartet deserves better than 
Moruzzi's luminescent curlicues, but it could hardly get a stronger performance 
than the Kronos account. "Assembly Required" may not have been worth the 
effort, but the concert lurking within was a characteristically bold adventure.

LAUGHING ON EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Seinfeld, who appeared Sunday night at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center, 
bills himself with all due modesty as "America's most imitated comedian" as 
well as "the king of observational comedy" -- news to us. 
</P>
<P>
In one respect he's right; he is at least one of the creators of the tone that 
informs the burgeoning sump of stand-up comedians nationwide whose acts and 
attitudes have become so interchangeable that they can now work under the label 
generic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The tone works in lieu of content, and it's borrowed largely from the 
mock-earnest swell and bogus sincerity of TV commercials. ("Have a headache? 
Take Anacin.") It's ironic, authoritative, snide, rhetorical, presumptive and 
inescapably banal, a knowing tone, as in "If you want to lose weight fast, try 
Dexadril" or "Inquiring minds want to know." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Seinfeld (who is 34) and his contemporaries -- second-generation TV 
kids -- may be powerless to realize that they've unconsciously picked up one of 
the few areas of American address that ring with confidence and uncontested 
certainty. The irony comes from their instinct that the pitch is hollow and 
mostly deceptive. But it's also relentless, like propaganda. After a while, one 
begins to believe -- or at least share a reference. 
</P>
<P>
The tone, then, is one of complicity. But it's amazing how little else there 
is. Seinfeld came on to talk about driving the 405 Freeway; airports and 
airline travel (it seems every comedian must feel naked without a bit on this 
topic); life as a Cub Scout; going out on Halloween in a Superman outfit (a 
large part of his act recalls being a kid); gym class; going to the movies ("I 
wanna see the guy who buys that horse-bucket-sized popcorn"); the Olympics, and 
horseback riding -- with lots of small side forays into one- or two-joke 
topics, and the occasional one-liner. ("I'm a single guy; I have no other guys 
attached to me.") 
</P>
<P>
Seinfeld is a pleasant, effortless performer who works clean (no small feat in 
this the time of the howling, offal-heaving monkey). The kind of likable 
smoothie who's popular in school because he's a good dancer and gets his date 
home on time -- and even chats with her dad. There's no vindictiveness in his 
act. He doesn't traffic in the mindless hate -- or self-hate -- that 
characterizes so many other stand-ups. He uses his body well. His language has 
imagery and rhythm. He's expressive. He's clear. And he's completely empty. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a single portion of his act that isn't fun -- amusing might be a 
better word -- but 10 minutes or so into it you begin wondering what this is 
all about, when is he going to say something or at least come up with something 
piquant. With the great comedians, the joke serves a coherent body of 
observations, or at least a theme. The laugh is an intro to a deeper truth. The 
less-than-great cut out after the punch. 
</P>
<P>
Seinfeld has no attention span. He's flipping channels all the time, through 
kiddie sitcoms and chitchat, and after a while you feel the dread unease of 
having overdosed on Fruit Loops. Cub Scouts? Halloween? When he announces with 
all the officiousness of a crime-show narrator that "the first 10 years of your 
life the only thought is: 'Get . . . Candy!' " you strongly suspect that this 
was a kid in whom nothing much was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Seinfeld appeared on "Later With Bob Costas" and mentioned having 
grown up in Massapequa, Long Island. "There was nothing there," he said. "There 
was just . . . nothing." He grinned incredulously. Hearing that line, you can 
understand the trouble with his act: He has no frame of reference. Yeats had a 
line about "paying homage to unevent." Seinfeld pays homage to insignificance, 
and he does it impeccably.

MICHAEL REAGAN OPENS THE MIKE AND GUESS WHO CALLS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at KSDO-AM (1130) knew they would get some interesting phone calls 
when their new morning talk-show host Michael Reagan started work Monday. Sure 
enough, when the first caller went on the air just after 5:30 a.m., the voice 
was familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, this is your old man," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite initial skepticism from the KSDO staff, who feared they were being made 
the victim of a prank, the caller was President Reagan. The staff had arranged 
for Michael's sister, Maureen, to call and wish him luck on his new career. His 
father called instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little far away to hear the program, but I wanted to congratulate you on 
your first day and wish you well," the President said on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reagan and KSDO program manager Jack Merker spent a few minutes talking 
with the President about his return to California and his weekend visit to Camp 
David. Father and son exchanged best wishes before the elder Reagan signed off. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the more different wake-up calls I've ever had," Merker said 
afterwards. "I've been doing this for 35 years, and I've never had a call from 
the White House. It's kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reagan, 44, the President's elder son, has signed a two-year contract 
to serve as an announcer for KSDO's top-rated morning show, reading the news 
and bantering with Merker. Reagan, the adopted son of Ronald Reagan and Jane 
Wyman, has been behind the mike at KSDO before, filling in for the regular 
talk-show hosts, such as former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also has served as a talk-show host for KABC-AM (790) in Los Angeles and 
for "Lingo," a television game show in Canada, among other broadcasting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a high school quarterback, his nickname was "Mouth," Reagan said at 
a news conference after his first morning stint. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
KSDO general manager Mike Shields acknowledged that the "Reagan name is very 
popular in San Diego," but he denied that Michael Reagan was hired because of 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to hire Michael was based on the experience he had already 
exhibited to us sitting in for Roger Hedgecock," Shields said. "Michael showed 
us he had the presence and talent to do the radio work. He has a very warm and 
friendly style."

Thanks to his parents, Reagan has always been in the public eye. It has not 
always been a comfortable position for him. In 1981, he created a stir when he 
used his father's name in a letter soliciting clients for an airplane parts 
company for which he worked. 
</P>
<P>
During the early part of his father's presidency, Michael focused much of his 
energy on organizing boat races for charity. Last year, he released something 
of a "Daddy Dearest" autobiography, "Michael Reagan: On the Outside Looking 
In," which detailed his problems growing up as the son of Ronald Reagan. Reagan 
and Wyman were divorced when he was 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"As you go through life, a lot of people try to use you," Reagan said Monday. 
"The toughest thing is trying to find who is using you and who is not." 
</P>
<P>
KSDO officials didn't have to try very hard to persuade him to join the 
station, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go through life telling people I turned down morning 
drive-time," he quipped. "It's new for me, and I'm looking forward to the 
stretch and getting into it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoys working mornings, which leaves him time to play golf and be 
with his family. Currently a resident of the San Fernando Valley, he plans to 
move to San Diego after his children, Cameron, 9, and Ashley, 7, finish the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, his father leaves office after eight years. Michael Reagan was asked 
what he would miss about having the White House as a second home. 
</P>
<P>
"The fights with Nancy," he said with a laugh, referring to his stepmother's 
battered media image. "Nancy and I were talking and we decided that the press 
is one fight ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he is in "awe" of his father's accomplishments, Michael, who wrote 
in his book that he always found it difficult to be close to his father, said 
he is looking forward to his father's return to California, so they can spend 
more time together. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he has learned from the example set by his father, a former radio 
sports broadcaster, but he does not try to compare himself to his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to live up to Mike Reagan, not Ronald Reagan," he said, adding that once 
the novelty of his family wears off, he will have to establish his own radio 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
"People just won't listen to a name," he said.

MUSIC WORLD RINGS AS NEWS OF PARIS OPERA FIRING SPREADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L'affaire Opera de la Bastille turned snitty Monday when the deposed musical 
and artistic director of the new Paris opera house and the man who fired him 
traded public barbs in the international press. 
</P>
<P>
The music world spent the day trying to make sense of the unceremonious sacking 
of Daniel Barenboim, even as its rumor mill continued to circulate that the 
Israeli conductor-pianist is the top contender for yet another coveted post: to 
replace the retiring Sir Georg Solti at the podium of the Chicago Symphony 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Those rumors remained unconfirmed Monday as Barenboim pleaded for French 
President Francois Mitterand to settle the crisis at the yet-to-open opera 
house on the site of Paris' famed Bastille prison. 
</P>
<P>
"It is for him (Mitterand) to choose between my presence and that of the 
international artistic community I have gathered and the program of the 
president of a couture house," Barenboim told a Paris news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim referred to Pierre Berge, chairman of the board of the 
government-sponsored Opera-Bastille and president of the Yves Saint-Laurent 
fashion house. Berge dismissed the conductor on Friday, saying he was demanding 
too much money. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barenboim said Monday he was not prepared to abandon his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Berge, responding on French television, said he would not bring Mitterrand into 
the dispute because, "it would become a political affair. . . . It is an affair 
of big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Berge maintains Barenboim's 7-million franc ($1.1-million) annual salary over 
four years is too much money for the four months a year the 46-year-old 
conductor would spend in Paris. Berge says the opera house made a 
counterproposal of 4 million francs ($628,570) a year over two years, but that 
it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The Opera-Bastille is a multimillion-dollar complex on the Place de la 
Bastille, site of the prison whose storming launched the French Revolution. The 
new opera house is meant to replace the ornate Palais Garnier, best-known as 
the Paris Opera, which will be reserved for dance. 
</P>
<P>
Berge said the house, in keeping with its mission of bringing opera to the 
people, should provide 220 performances a year, instead of the 150 envisaged by 
Barenboim. Barenboim's plan to put on between 150-160 performances a season had 
been praised by musicians, pointing out that longer rehearsal periods and 
higher artistic standards are possible with fewer scheduled performances. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, commented on the contretemps surrounding a job he twice turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"The essential part of this story is that Berge wanted to take artistic 
direction away from Daniel Barenboim," Fleischmann said. "The basic problem is 
that no one seems to be in charge there." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann said that, after he had concluded his negotiations to become leader 
of Opera Bastille, in late 1986, "they offered me the job a second time, in 
June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, everything was so unplanned, and their expectations so 
unrealistic, I turned it down again. They were talking about putting on 250 
performances a year, which is just impossible. Look at the current, terrible 
standards at the Metropolitan Opera -- and they don't put on anything like 250 
performances a year (the actual number is closer to 210, according to a Met 
spokesperson)." 
</P>
<P>
Fleischmann said that the American system of boards of directors running 
artistic institutions is preferable, in his view, to government-run opera 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"The limitations imposed by the French bureaucracy and by politicians wanting 
to run the opera result in artistic quality sometimes disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
American boards of directors, Fleischmann said, "seem to have more respect for 
artists than either bureaucrats or politicians." 
</P>
<P>
About Barenboim's firing, Ian Campbell, general director of San Diego Opera, 
commented, "Opera companies need to be led by one solitary view. Barenboim has 
every right as an artistic director to require certain things be done. You 
don't hire a dog, and then do the barking yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Barenboim's firing prompted Patrice Chereau, stage director for the Bastille 
Opera's first production, Mozart's "Don Giovanni," to resign from the 
production that Barenboim was to conduct. At the same time, a host of 
world-class performers -- including Pierre Boulez, Jessye Norman, Herbert von 
Karajan and Sir Georg Solti -- sent a petition to Culture Minister Jack Lang 
saying they might cancel their performances at the Opera-Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
"If Daniel Barenboim is not maintained as artistic and musical director, we 
regret to inform you that the conditions of our participation in this project 
are also subject to question," the petition read. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Sunday in the Paris weekly Le Journal du Dimanche, 
Berge said he was only 80% sure the opera house could open its first season on 
Jan. 10, 1990 as scheduled. (The hall is scheduled to open with a gala concert 
on July 14 -- the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille.)

'NOVA' DOESN'T MAKE 'HOT ENOUGH' CLEAR ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hot Enough for You?" asks the title of tonight's edition of PBS' "Nova," 
suggesting that the generally excellent science show's consideration of "the 
greenhouse effect" might be informal, lively, clear and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's none of those things. If you're expecting "Nova" to 
condense and explain all of the confusing, conflicting, uncertain and worrying 
claims about how atmospheric pollutants may be heating up the earth and causing 
other havoc, you're going to be disappointed. A muddled subject has resulted in 
a muddled show (at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 9 p.m. on Channel 50). 
</P>
<P>
In the first half-hour, we're deluged with various voices, speculations, 
mind-boggling figures, pessimistic scientific studies, inconclusive scientific 
studies, technical talk and a lot of "maybes." 
</P>
<P>
Several scientists voice their theories about the possible effects of carbon 
dioxide and other fossil-fuel wastes in the atmosphere: The overall temperature 
of the earth might go up, or maybe just temperatures in certain areas; the sea 
level could rise; there may be heavy crop damage, starvation, etc. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot Enough for You?" lacks both the perspective and the tools -- a few 
graphics would have been nice -- to make all of this comprehensible, or at 
least to sort out the more viable theories from the more far-fetched ones. 
</P>
<P>
The program is a bit better in the final 15 minutes or so, where it considers 
potential solutions -- from practical if controversial ones, such as more (and 
safer, less costly) nuclear energy, to extremely unlikely ones such as planting 
250,000 acres of forest for every conventional-fuel energy plant. TERRY 
ATKINSON

'PUMPKINHEAD': SO MANY WRITERS, SO LITTLE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extensive writing credits for the horror film "Pumpkinhead" (citywide) read 
like a confusing textbook case of Hollywood ampersands and arbitrated 
punctuation: Screenplay by Mark Patrick Carducci with Gary Gerani, based on a 
story by Carducci and Stan Winston &amp; Richard C. Weinman, inspired by a poem 
(!!!) by Ed Justin. 
</P>
<P>
With no fewer than five writers involved, it's almost a cinch that the 
carefully crafted result of so many skilled hands at work will be juicy 
dialogue -- such as "Don't go out there!" "Molly's out there!" and "God is the 
only thing that can stop what's out there!" 
</P>
<P>
What's out there is not the Great Pumpkin, alas, but a 12-foot-tall demon that 
hisses and snickers before dispatching its teen-age victims. The creature in 
question gets its moniker from the "pumpkin patch/graveyard" in which its 
remains lie buried -- that is, when it isn't being called forth and resurrected 
by the local Southern bumpkins, who occasionally dispatch Pumpkinhead on 
missions of vengeance with the help of a witch. 
</P>
<P>
This loathsome evil spirit's head does not resemble any indigenous backwoods 
fruit, but its insect-cum-anthropoid form is suspiciously similar to that of 
the title villain of "Alien," albeit less slimy and more wrinkled. (Picture 
Sigourney Weaver being terrorized by a monster wearing Dustin Hoffman's old-age 
makeup from "Little Big Man" and you'll have the idea.) 
</P>
<P>
The unpleasantness is set in motion when a pack of city kids visit the country 
to do some dirt-biking, and the most obnoxious of the boys, drunk, accidentally 
strikes and kills the young son of a local fruit-stand owner. (If nothing else, 
the film is an effective "Don't Drink and Motocross" public-service 
commercial.) The teen-agers flee the accident scene but soon their remote cabin 
is besieged by a rifle-resistant Pumpkinhead, turned loose by the distraught 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the picture turns into a morality tale about how revenge, once 
tasted, is not so sweet, as the father (played by Lance Henriksen, the helpful 
android of "Aliens") comes to regret the carnage he's set in motion. Even he 
can't undo the spell, though, and soon realizes that to do battle with the 
demon, he must literally do battle with himself. It's an interesting idea -- 
though not nearly as interesting as it was 33 years ago in "Forbidden Planet," 
which had Walter Pidgeon engaged in much more compelling combat with his own 
id. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Winston steps in as director (and co-scenarist) here after many years 
leading one of Hollywood's top special makeup effects units. Ironically, 
Winston shows a surer directorial touch with the early, more human scenes 
(especially those between Henriksen and son) than he does later with the spooks 
and scares, which are never even faintly frightening. He doesn't win any more 
points for having his creature followed by artsy mood lighting wherever it goes 
in the supposedly black night. 
</P>
<P>
The one major departure "Pumpkinhead" (MPAA-rated R) offers from the 
supernatural-mass-murder-in-the-woods genre, for which some gratitude may be in 
order, is that its young actors don't engage in the usual illicit sex 
immediately before being punished with a gruesome slaughter. But neither do 
they read, uh, poetry -- not even the alluded-to "Pumpkinhead, The Poem." All 
those writers and not even one pro-literacy plug?

ACTORS RISE ABOVE TEEN BATHOS IN 'DESPERATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tragedy erupts when three small-town Southern adolescents are "Desperate for 
Love," tonight's CBS movie at 9 p.m. on channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
Alex (Brian Bloom), the handsome, college-bound son of a good family, is 
involved with Lily (Tammy Lauren), a sexy, troubled teen from the wrong side of 
the tracks. Alex's best friend Cliff (Christian Slater), tormented and 
insecure, is torn between his own love for Lily and his loyalty to Alex. 
</P>
<P>
When Alex's parents, wanting to ensure a good future for him, forbid their son 
to see Lily, she uses Cliff for comfort. Euphoric, then disturbed, his feelings 
become more and more complicated as he realizes that Lily still loves Alex. 
When Alex's final betrayal of Lily leads to his violent death, Cliff is accused 
of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Paige Mitchell's script, directed by Michael Tuchner, covers ground 
familiar to any soap opera fan, but all the bathos is surprisingly bearable, 
due to strong performances from the three young leads. Slater is particularly 
touching as a lonely boy whose mother's grief and shame over the desertion of 
her husband has scarred him deeply. As the mother, Veronica Cartwright is 
another moving presence. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom has an emotional depth that proves he's more than dramatic, dark good 
looks, and Lauren uses her puffy-lipped sensuality as an effective mask for the 
disturbed child underneath. LYNNE HEFFLEY

ORANGE COUNTY JUDGE UNDER FIRE TO RESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
CARTER ALLEGEDLY GRANTED DEFENDANTS PREFERRED TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS and BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter, who has been under investigation 
by the state Commission on Judicial Performance for allegedly giving 
preferential treatment to defendants in his courtroom and accepting favors from 
prostitutes, has submitted his resignation, it was learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Russell A. Bostrom, who until two weeks ago was presiding judge in the 
Harbor branch of Orange County Municipal Court, said Carter told him Monday 
that he would resign as of Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom, who said Carter gave him no reason for his resignation from Harbor 
Court, declined to comment on whether the state investigation played any role 
in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Carter told The Times that Carter sent a letter to Gov. 
George Deukmejian on Friday tendering his resignation. The commission, which 
generally operates in almost total secrecy, announced in October that it would 
hold formal hearings on allegations against Carter and Municipal Judge Calvin 
P. Schmidt, who is facing similar accusations. Schmidt also is a judge at 
Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 62, was first placed under investigation by the Newport Beach Police 
Department and the Orange County district attorney's office in 1984 when he was 
overheard in a tape-recorded phone conversation arranging a rendezvous with a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
In another taped conversation, Carter agreed to help a former client and 
golfing partner who phoned him after being arrested on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has announced no date for its hearings on the allegations 
against Carter and Schmidt, and commission officials have said no decision has 
been made on whether the hearings would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
Carter could not be reached for comment Monday night. His wife said she had no 
comment on her husband's resignation. Carter's attorney, Byron K. McMillan, 
also declined to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied He Would Resign 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Carter vehemently denied rumors that he planned to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Carter has denied any wrongdoing in connection with any of the allegations 
against him. But he has refused to discuss any of the details of those 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 investigation began after Della Christine Johnson was arrested by 
Fullerton police on suspicion of prostitution. She told police after her arrest 
that she was an acquaintance of Carter and that he had hired her as a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she had performed an act of prostitution in exchange for a debt 
owed to Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
In statements later filed in court, Johnson said she had been told that Schmidt 
would fix a traffic ticket for her in exchange for sex, and that she agreed. 
But when it came time to pay off the judge, she said, Carter called her and 
said he was going to collect the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt has refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a former client and golfing friend of Carter, Jeffrey John Harbison, 
called Carter from the Newport Beach City Jail and told him he was being held 
on suspicion of possession of cocaine and needed the judge's help. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, in a taped conversation, told Harbison that he would do what he could. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Court Judge Selim Franklin later told The Times that Carter called jail 
officials and arranged to have Harbison's bail reduced from $25,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Carter also has been accused of giving preferential treatment to Harbison and 
his girl friend, Susan Marsha Edwards, in the handling of several traffic 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The handling of Edwards' traffic tickets reportedly created friction between 
Carter and Harbor Judge Susanne Shaw after Carter allegedly had a bailiff 
retrieve tickets from Shaw's court and bring them to his courtroom. Shaw 
allegedly complained about the incident to other judges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state Commission on Judicial Performance refuses to discuss 
details of its investigations, sources say the panel's inquiries into Harbor 
Court go beyond just Carter and Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom reportedly is under investigation because of a meeting he had with 
Newport Beach city officials in which he and Franklin are accused of trying to 
apply pressure to end a police investigation of Carter and Schmidt. Bostrom has 
denied any wrongdoing in connection with his dealings with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has the authority to privately admonish a judge, ask the state 
Supreme Court to publicly censure him or her, or ask the high court to remove a 
judge from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was appointed to the Harbor bench in 1982 by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He was in private law practice before that. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the state Commission on Judicial Performance received 
complaints about Carter several years ago but backed away from an investigation 
after learning that the district attorney's office was conducting its own 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently more than a year ago, county prosecutors decided that they had 
insufficient information to file any criminal charges against Carter. The 
commission then asked for the county prosecutors' investigative files and the 
prosecutors complied. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the district attorney's investigation said that its 
investigators had difficulty getting cooperation from some witnesses, including 
prostitutes and some people accused of attempting to peddle influence in Harbor 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom's only comment on Carter on Monday was: "As his presiding judge for 2 
years, I can certainly confirm that he was a very hard-working judge. I think 
that's about it, really." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt's only public comment so far has been: "I hope I am a very good judge. 
I hope I am a fair judge. Let's get it all out in the open (by having the state 
judicial commission hearings). 
</P>
<P>
Carter has said in interviews with The Times that the publicity over the 
investigation upset him greatly at first, but that he has since grown numb to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting shot," Carter said. "It hurts when the bullet enters, but 
after they've taken it out the trauma settles down." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Carter told The Times that he had no reason to resign and that he 
intended to fight whatever charges were raised against him at the formal 
commission hearing.

MAN HELD IN ALLEGED BARGAINS SCAM AT MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said that a man who posed as a Sears employee and offered bargains on 
appliances and electronic gear was in custody Monday on suspicion of stealing 
more than $20,000 from people at Westminster and Costa Mesa malls. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vito Vasti, 33, is suspected in at least four scams in which the victims 
were told to deliver cash in a sealed envelope for television sets, 
videocassette recorders and video cameras, Westminster Police Detective Dave 
Stronach said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasti was arrested Friday night after two employees from the Pro Tire Shop in 
Tustin met him at the Westminster Mall with $3,000 cash in a sealed envelope, 
Stronach said. 
</P>
<P>
The employees, Greg Wood and Joe Small, became suspicious about the cheap 
prices and called police. While undercover officers watched, Vasti offered to 
take them to a Sears loading dock to pick up their merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Vasti was arrested on suspicion of grand theft and was being held at County 
Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. Arraignment was set for this morning in West 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives believe that Vasti was involved in a least three other such scams, 
but Stronach said he may be a suspect in a total of eight to 10 such operations

stores, where Vasti allegedly took the money and never returned, he said.

<P>
"It's the same identical thing," Stronach said. "In one case, he even pointed 
to an employee inside the store and told the victim he'd be right out to load 
his appliances."

COLD BIRD BLAMED IN $200,000 HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chilly bird turned out to be a bigger problem than homeowner Harry Tang could 
have imagined, fire investigators speculated Monday after a blaze all but 
destroyed Tang's two-story home. 
</P>
<P>
Tang's pet parrot had been chilly at night, so he bought an electric space 
heater to keep the bird warm, Anaheim Fire Department investigator Mike Feeney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But something went wrong and a fire ignited, Anaheim city spokeswoman Carolyn 
Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not sure if it was a short because of a faulty extension cord, or if 
the heater was defective," Griebe added. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, by the time firefighters arrived at the house in the 1300 block of 
Dallas Street shortly before 1 a.m. Monday, it was engulfed in flames. Tang was 
hard at work in an unsuccessful effort to put out the fire with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
Tang survived without injury, but it was unclear whether the parrot did. The 
blaze caused $200,000 damage to the six-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
The good news? Firefighters saved several thousand dollars worth of koi fish by 
filling garbage cans with water and transferring them with fishing nets, Feeney 
said.

MAN ADMITS HE SET FIRE TO ESTRANGED WIFE'S CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man confessed to fire investigators Monday that he set fire to his 
estranged wife's car at her apartment complex, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Weisenberg, 42, was already in the city's jail facility on suspicion of 
drunk driving when he admitted that he doused Cheryl Weisenberg's 1984 Ford 
Thunderbird with gasoline, set it afire and drove away, Anaheim city 
spokeswoman Carolyn Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
The car fire occurred in a carport in the 400 block of South Clementine Street 
about 11:25 p.m. Saturday. Shortly after the fire, Anaheim police arrested 
Randy Weisenberg after they chased him for allegedly running two red lights. 
They caught up after his car overturned. A blood test indicated that he had a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.14, Griebe said. A person is considered intoxicated 
under state law with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 or greater. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses identified Weisenberg as the man who set fire to the car, police 
said. Weisenberg allegedly started the fire in his wife's apartment complex 
carport, which is attached to several apartments, Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in divorce proceedings, and the motive is believed to be that he had 
some kind of problem with the wife and the divorce proceedings," Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $2,000 damage to the car. No one was injured in 
the fire.

BUENA PARK'S POLICE-FIRE PAY OFFER HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ and KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 100 picketing Buena Park police officers and firefighters joined a 
contingent of residents and packed a City Council meeting Monday night to 
protest a contract offer they say would keep them among the lowest-paid public 
safety employees in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers and firefighters were protesting a proposed 3-year contract 
that would give them a 5% increase each year, with additional raises in the 
final year of 1.68% for Fire Department employees and 2.16% for police, said 
Buena Park Police Sgt. Robert Chaney, president of the police officers' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Officers would have the option to divert 1 percentate point of the salary 
increase toward health benefits, Chaney said, reducing their raise to just 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park firefighters and po lice officers have been without a contract since 
October. Police officers earn up to about $3,386 a month in wages and benefits 
-- the lowest of nine comparable police departments surveyed by the City 
Council, Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-paid officers of those studied work in Irvine for $4,161 per month, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to settle with just being brought up to the average," said 
Chaney, who declined to say how much more money the association wants. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members "always want to give us the salary in the average, but 
they don't want to give it to us in the other areas," he said, referring to 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers and firefighters picketed outside the council chambers for 
about an hour before the 5 p.m. meeting, then joined residents inside and took 
their case directly to the council. 
</P>
<P>
One officer announced that he is quitting the department and going to work for 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department because he cannot afford to live in 
Buena Park on his current salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Pay and Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fairman, 24, a 3-year veteran of the department, said: "The L.A. sheriff 
pays a lot better, and the benefits are a lot better" than in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Wickstrom, a 17-year resident of Buena Park, supported the police and 
firefighters: "We need quality people. No qualified persons are going to come 
for the pay. There are too many places that pay more." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Grasha, another resident, echoed that sentiment: "They are being forced 
to beg the City Council, and I think the city owes them more." 
</P>
<P>
Because the issue was not on the council meeting agenda, council members and 
city officials did not directly respond to the officers and residents who spoke 
during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna L. Chessen did say, however, that what the city has offered "is 
fair and reasonable. . . . We have stayed within our budget constraints."

GREAT SNAKES ALIVE! SID'S ON THE MEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sid Vicious, Orange County's most famous boa constrictor, is recuperating 
nicely from cancer treatment, the snake's veterinarian reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing really well, and I'm going to be taking him back to his home at 
Mission Viejo High School" today, Dr. Scott Weldy said, adding that Sid also 
will probably be back on solid foods today. 
</P>
<P>
Sid is an 8-foot, South American boa constrictor who normally lives in a 
laboratory at Mission Viejo High. He became a celebrity last week when UC 
Irvine's Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic gave him experimental 
treatment for cancer of the mouth. The treatment -- the first of its kind in 
the world -- drew extensive media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The whole thing started about 7 weeks ago when students noticed a sore on Sid's 
lower right jaw. Mission Viejo High biology teacher Emmett Carlson, who cares 
for the snake, referred Sid to Weldy, an alumnus of the high school. Weldy 
found that the sore 
</P>
<P>
was actually a malignant tumor. He then made arrangements for Sid's 
history-making treatment at UCI last week. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Sid received an injection of a dye-like chemical, 
chloro-aluminium sulfonated phthalocyanine. The dye concentrated in the 
cancerous tumor on Sid's mouth, and specialists at the institute focused a 
laser on the tumor. The intense light of the laser reacted with the dye to burn 
away cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
"All the signs indicate the treatment worked," Weldy said Monday. "The tumor 
has dead tissues now that should slough right off the mouth. We'll know in 2 to 
4 weeks for sure, but it certainly looks like the laser and the dye did the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Weldy also noted that the treatment has "potentially big significance for human 
patients. . . . This chemical we used on Sid hasn't been approved for human use 
yet, but this treatment could help give more information about using something 
like this on humans." 
</P>
<P>
Before his treatment, Sid was given some some anesthetics. As a result, he 
appeared lethargic and dispirited during his laser treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, as Weldy displayed the recuperating Sid, the boa seemed full of 
life. "He's in good shape now," the veterinarian said. "He likes to be held. 
Still, I'm going to tell the students not to pick him up very much for several 
days. He needs lots of rest." 
</P>
<P>
Going home to Mission Viejo High means that Sid will rejoin his boa wife, 
Camille. "The two are married," biology teacher Carlson said last Thursday. "I 
named the male boa Sid because I thought it sounded nice with Camille. The 
students expanded the name to Sid Vicious." 
</P>
<P>
But the name, taken from a deceased punk rock star with a violent past, hardly 
fits the Mission Viejo boa, according to both Carlson and Weldy. "Sid's pretty 
mellow," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Weldy, while holding Sid on Monday, "Sid is a nice guy. It's good to see 
him feeling better again." 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, so many television and still-photograph crews aimed cameras at 
Sid during his UCI treatment that Weldy had to put cotton pads over the snake's 
photosensitive eyes. Sid seemed very uncomfortable that day with all the media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Sid hammed it up for the press as Weldy held him. The snake held 
his head up proudly, his black eyes staring regally. 
</P>
<P>
And when a photographer began snapping pictures, Sid couldn't resist sticking 
out his tongue.

NOTEBOOK: CITY GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS AND RUNS INTO MURPHY'S LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
In its first week as a city, Dana Point played the smiling host to a series of 
inaugural bashes that included rousing speeches and a champagne reception at a 
fancy hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
In its second week, Dana Point came crashing back to earth. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 9, at the city's first regular council meeting, almost anything that could 
have gone wrong did. 
</P>
<P>
First, City Manager William O. Talley called in sick with the flu and City 
Atty. Jerry M. Patterson was forced to take his place, fumbling along through 
unfamiliar territory during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Mayor Judy Curreri looked up with a certain degree of alarm to see that 
some members of an audience of more than 100 local residents were being forced 
to stand outside in a cold hallway. It seems that the meeting room of the 
Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District where the city is holding its 
council meetings was not large enough to accommodate them all. 
</P>
<P>
Curreri conscientiously asked some of the shivering residents to step inside 
and line up along one wall where there was still standing room, but only three 
people responded. 
</P>
<P>
That might have been because the others couldn't hear the mayor's offer over 
the din of a lively basketball game going on next door. 
</P>
<P>
The city is meeting in the park district's community center until a new office 
building in which the city will have space is ready for occupancy in about 6 
months. The city will have its own civic center eventually, but that project is 
at least 2 years down the road, Talley has said.. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 2 1/2-hour council meeting, residents at the back of the meeting 
room found themselves straining to hear what council members, city staffers and 
a parade of speakers were saying. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, when a resident's voice could not be heard over a podium 
microphone, Curreri asked whether the microphone was working. A city staff 
member sheepishly replied that the microphone was to record the speakers, not 
amplify their voices. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members also found that there is more to running a city than 
sitting back and allowing praise to be heaped upon them, as was the case during 
the inaugural festivities. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting began on an uplifting note, however, when resident Dennis Block 
took the podium to say: "I'd like to tell all the wonderful people of Dana 
Point that I salute you." 
</P>
<P>
But that was one of the last noncontroversial comments to come from the 
speakers. John Bates officially became Dana Point's first purveyor of bad news 
when he stepped up to the podium early in the meeting to complain about the 
high accident rate on Selva Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the council investigating that situation," Bates said, as 
council members Bill Bamattre, Curreri, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause and Ingrid 
McGauire listened intently, some scribbling notes to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, the council got it with both barrels. Lawyers involved in 
a complex legal battle over rent hikes at a Dana Point mobile home park stepped 
to the podium to unleash a barrage of legalisms. The council sat numbly as 
lawyers for both sides presented their arguments in courtroom fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The council was not asked to take any action on that dispute other than to 
"work with these people in no specific direction," according to Gerald Gibbs, 
attorney for the mostly elderly residents of the mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
As Curreri said to those present at one point during the meeting: "We're 
learning and you're learning, as we're all new to this."

DRIVER HELD IN MULTI-VEHICLE COLLISION; 12 HURT

The driver of a car who ran a red light in Arleta, causing a multi-vehicle 
accident in which 12 people were injured, has been arrested on suspicion of 
drunk driving, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Ochoa, 21, of Sun Valley failed to stop at an intersection Sunday 
evening, police said. He suffered head and chest injuries and was listed in 
stable condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where he was 
arrested, Sgt. John O'Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ochoa was driving his Camaro west on Terra Bella Street at 7:30 
p.m. when he ran the red light at Woodman Avenue and was struck by a southbound 
pickup. Both vehicles then hit a motorcycle and another car. 
</P>
<P>
Police said several beer cans were found in Ochoa's car, which came to a rest 
against a tree in the front yard of an apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
Three other people, including two men riding with Ochoa, were seriously 
injured. Alejandro Villafando, 21, of Van Nuys and Jose Perez, whose age and 
address were not immediately determined, suffered internal injuries and had to 
be removed from the wreckage by firefighters using "jaws of life" rescue 
equipment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and 
Villafando was in stable condition at Holy Cross.

A DRASTIC PLASTIC SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT CARDS FOR HOUSES SEEN AS NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN HOT CALIFORNIA MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Californians can't seem to get enough plastic, and now they can get a credit 
card to help them with the ultimate purchase: a home. 
</P>
<P>
A mortgage company with more than five dozen franchise operations in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties is pre-approving home buyers much the way banks and other 
lenders routinely pre-approve customers who go shopping for cars. 
</P>
<P>
Such pre-approval is not new, but what gives CompuFund National Mortgage 
Network a little edge is that it guarantees loan approval within 2 hours for 
most customers and locks in an interest rate for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The company, based in Pleasanton in Alameda County, also issues its HomeBuyer 
Express credit card with a mortgage loan limit on it, thus extending the buying 
power of people who use pieces of plastic to charge almost anything. The card 
would enable a buyer to move quickly on property. 
</P>
<P>
"The average consumer can use this as another way to do home shopping," said 
Sigmund Anderman, CompuFund's president. "Even if they use our services as a 
way to get another loan someplace else, God bless them. They should be shopping 
around for low rates." 
</P>
<P>
Most new credit card customers, though, are apparently not abandoning 
CompuFund. Anderman said more than 80% of the credit cards issued since June 
led to mortgage funding. Most of the applicants have been average, middle-class 
buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
CompuFund's effort is one of the many marketing campaigns that cash-rich 
mortgage bankers are devising to lure a diminishing number of home loan 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California may not be feeling the effects of a real estate slowdown, 
but mortgage companies nationally are shutting their doors because of lower 
demand, mortgage bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderman said demand has sunk 25% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
The lower demand means that competition in the mortgage industry is intense, 
said Walter P. Blass, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Co. in 
Newport Beach, one of the nation's largest mortgage firms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the cost of processing loans has been soaring, and the only 
way to cut costs is to cut the number of documents needed for loan approvals, 
which is what most pre-qualification programs do. 
</P>
<P>
The danger in weaker underwriting is evident, he said, in that more loans could 
go sour. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman is developing a pre-approval home loan program for the 40,000 
employees of its parent company, American Express Co., and its subsidiaries. If 
successful, the program could be extended to employees at other select 
companies, Blass said. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Hammond Co., a regional mortgage banking firm in Newport 
Beach, began offering its Starter Loan. The program, for adjustable-rate loans 
only, allows a borrower to skip the first three mortgage payments, which are 
tacked onto the loan as principal. 
</P>
<P>
Over the typical 30-year life of the mortgage, the borrower ends up paying 
about three times the amount saved by skipping the first payments. Borrowers 
have been receptive nonetheless, company president Thomas T. Hammond said, as 
business jumped 25% in the first week the Starter Loan was available. 
</P>
<P>
"A mortgage is a mortgage is a mortgage," Hammond said. "You can twist and turn 
them around, fiddle around with cash flow and other things, and they all come 
out the same. We're all just trying to think of things to get more business." 
</P>
<P>
But overall, new gimmicks and massive advertising do not often help much, 
Hammond said, because studies have shown that transactions are typically 
controlled by realtors or builder-sellers. And they usually take home buyers to 
the same few lenders they have worked with in the past -- even when customers 
ask for specific lenders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Grubb &amp; Ellis, a real estate brokerage, teamed up with the 
financial giant Citicorp in New York and the Tokyu department store in Tokyo to 
offer credit cards with $500,000 lines of credit to wealthy Japanese for buying 
homes in Hawaii and on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any direct purchases yet, but the first tour group is coming in 
March or April to look at property," said Tracey Schiavello, marketing vice 
president at the Grubb &amp; Ellis regional office in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had about 30 inquiries, and three or four Japanese investors who need to 
buy soon will be coming over in the next month or so." 
</P>
<P>
CompuFund's credit card has taken off in the last few months, Anderman said. Of 
2,000 cards issued last year, most were issued in the last few months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlimited Credit Lines 
</P>
<P>
CompuFund, which offers loans through 110 mortgage companies in California and 
20 more in Seattle and Dallas, has not limited its lines of credit. Recently, 
Anderman said, the firm issued a card with a credit limit of more than 
$900,000, but the average loan is $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most prospective borrowers need only to bring in a few months worth of pay 
stubs to show where they work and how much they make and recent bank statements 
showing that they have the money for a down payment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Within 2 hours, CompuFund will verify those figures and the borrower's credit 
history, and it will determine how big the loan can be. Within a day, the 
company will issue a credit card with the loan limit on it. The loan is 
contingent only on an appraisal of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers who must rely on income from rental property, trusts, investments or 
sources other than salaries will have to provide more information to document 
their incomes, Anderman said. Those borrowers will not get approval within 2 
hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Elaborate Applications 
</P>
<P>
Anderman said elaborate applications, forms and many verifying documents are 
not needed for most customers. Nothing, after all, is foolproof, so an 
inventive defrauder cannot be stopped, he said, no matter what is required. 
</P>
<P>
Use of a credit card may provide CompuFund with good will from customers who 
are used to plastic buying power, Anderman said: "In the world of mortgage 
banking and home loan shopping, this concept provides the consumer with almost 
instant approval."

IN EROSION OF ANTI-TAKEOVER STRATEGY, 3 MILLION PRIME SHARES SOLD TO MAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Prime Computer won't be able to count on its largest institutional investor to 
help thwart a hostile takeover bid by Tustin-based MAI Basic Four. 
</P>
<P>
The state of Michigan, which held 3 million Prime shares in a pension fund that 
serves about 300,000 current and retired state workers, has decided to tender 
those shares to MAI's $20-a-share offer for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a good price," Michigan State Treasurer Robert A. Bowman said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to defeat the MAI bid, Prime management has tried to convince 
investors and Wall Street analysts that it will take actions that will 
eventually boost Prime's stock above the $20-a-share offering price. Prime, a 
maker of minicomputers based in Natick, Mass., has also argued that MAI's 
offer, heavily financed by debt, could impair Prime's competitiveness over the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
But Prime may be losing the battle to persuade investors to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"Comparing the $20 cash with the potential $22 or $23 if Prime did things on 
its own, we figured we'd take the bird in hand," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
MAI said last week that 29.3 million Prime shares have been tendered to its 
offer, including the Michigan pension fund. That represents nearly 65% of 
Prime's 48.3 million common shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
MAI began its $970-million bid for Prime on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan pension fund paid $19 for each of its 3 million Prime shares -- or 
about $57 million -- when it bought the stock "several years ago," Bowman said. 
At the $20 selling price, the state will receive a 5% return on its investment.

ORANGE COUNTY PLASTICS FIRM TO BUILD TIJUANA PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kyowa American Corp., the American subsidiary of a Tokyo-based firm that makes 
plastic cabinets for television sets, is the latest among an increasing number 
of Japanese companies to decide to manufacture at a Tijuana maquiladora. 
</P>
<P>
Kyowa American, based in Costa Mesa, has purchased an 8-acre tract in the 
Tecolotes section in Tijuana, administrator Terry Nagura confirmed in a 
telephone interview. Kyowa's plans call for construction to start on a 
100,000-square-foot building in April and for manufacturing to begin by 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Maquiladoras are foreign-operated plants where goods destined mainly for the U. 
S. market are manufactured or assembled with low-cost Mexican labor. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor costs in Mexico are one-tenth of what they are in America," Nagura said 
when asked the reasons for the move. Kyowa, however, will not lay off any of 
its 400 employees at two plants in Irvine and Costa Mesa once the Tijuana plant 
opens, she said. Instead, Kyowa will expand the line of products made in its 
Orange County plants. 
</P>
<P>
Kyowa American, a unit of Kyowa Electric &amp; Chemical, is an injection-mold 
plastics manufacturer whose clients include Sony, Hitachi and Mitsubishi 
television manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
To supply its Japanese TV manufacturer customers in the United States, Kyowa 
has had operations here since 1973. Kyowa transferred its plant to Irvine from 
Atlanta in 1978, then opened another plant in Costa Mesa in 1986, Nagura said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Tijuana plant is operating, Kyowa plans to begin making additional, 
smaller plastics products at its Orange County plants, including parts for 
typewriters, facsimile machines and household appliances, Nagura said.

WIFE BEATEN TO DEATH WITH BOTTLE

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was arrested this morning after his wife was beaten to death 
with an empty champagne bottle. Their 13-month-old daughter, who was in her 
mother's arms during the beating, was placed on a life-support system with head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, called police about 12:30 a.m. to say that someone had 
been killed at his apartment in the 700 block of West First Street, Santa Ana 
Police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Officers found Helen Lynch, 35, on the 
living room floor, dead of massive head injuries. In her arms was the couple's 
daughter, Natalie Alexandra Lynch, who had also been beaten on the head with 
the bottle, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's two other daughters, ages 4 and 9, were asleep in the bedroom when 
their mother was slain. Neighbors said this morning that officers took the 
daughters out of the apartment through the bedroom window so they wouldn't see 
their mother's beaten body. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that Lynch, an engineer, is a Scottish citizen and that his wife 
was an Australian citizen. They had lived in the United States for about four 
years. Lynch was booked into Orange County Jail, and bail was set at $250,000.

A minimum-security inmate today disappeared from the Hall of Justice in Los 
Angeles, where he was assigned to mop floors. Wagner T. Huber, 24, a member of 
the custodial work crew swabbing floors in the building, walked away at about 
3:15 a.m., said sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Huber, whose hometown was unknown, was arrested by West Hollywood station 
deputies on Nov. 3, 1988, and sentenced to one year in County Jail on a 
misdemeanor possession of fraudulent checks conviction.

Consumer advocate Ralph Nader lambasted the media today for a "tilted 
evaluation" of the Reagan record, saying the President's real legacy is less 
public health and safety for bigger corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Nader, appearing at a news conference with representatives of five 
environmental, health and auto safety groups, charged the media and Democrats 
have rolled over and allowed President Reagan to cast a "Hollywood-type gloss" 
on a record that should be seen as disastrous for the average American. "This 
is a regime that came in on a philosophy of establishing a government of Exxon, 
by General Motors and for Du Pont," he said. "He left consumers, workers and 
pollution victims defenseless and gave corporate interests pretty much what 
they wanted."

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS CALIF. REDISTRICT PLAN

A California redistricting plan that placed Democrats in control of the state's 
congressional delegation does not unlawfully discriminate against Republicans, 
the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the redistricting plan. Republicans had 
challenged it as an unconstitutional form of gerrymandering. 
</P>
<P>
The court dismissed the GOP appeal last Oct. 3. But then on Nov. 14 the 
justices announced that they might consider the case after all. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the court's second thoughts in November were not explained. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and 
Anthony M. Kennedy voted to grant full review to the California dispute. Four 
votes are needed to grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Judgment Is Affirmed' 
</P>
<P>
Six justices joined in upholding the redistricting plan in a one-sentence 
decision. "The judgment is affirmed," they said. 
</P>
<P>
The court said in 1986 in an Indiana legislative reapportionment case that 
gerrymandering -- the manipulation of voting district boundaries for partisan 
gain -- may be unlawful even when it results in districts meeting the 
"one-person, one-vote" requirement. 
</P>
<P>
But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the Indiana plan that was 
attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only four justices joined 
in the court's main opinion, authored by Justice Byron R. White. 
</P>
<P>
White said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it "will consistently 
degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on the political processes as 
a whole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Complaint 
</P>
<P>
California Republicans said that is exactly what has happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
"The essence of representative democracy is undermined" when "a 
computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what the congressional results 
will be throughout the decade," they said in seeking Supreme Court 
reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge federal court upheld California's plan by a 2-1 vote last April.

Former PTL leader Jim Bakker pleaded innocent today to federal charges of

money to support his lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment," Bakker said 
after the arraignment. He made no comment during the hearing, but defense 
attorney George T. Davis asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor to impose a gag 
order in the case after reading aloud parts of an interview with a bankruptcy 
judge who called Bakker a "sawed-off little runt" and "a thief." Taylor took 
the motion under advisement.

Gov. Bob Martinez signed a new death warrant today for mass murderer Ted Bundy, 
who lost his bid to have the Supreme Court overturn his death sentence for the 
slaying of a 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice has been on hold for a decade," the governor said after Bundy's final 
appeal was rejected, "and it's about time Ted Bundy paid for his crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die at 7 a.m. next Tuesday for the murder of 
Kimberly Diane Leach, whose sexually abused body was found in a pigsty two 
months after she disappeared. Bundy, whose case was the subject of a TV 
miniseries, also received death sentences for the 1978 slayings of two Florida 
State University sorority sisters who were beaten and strangled just three 
weeks before the Leach murder. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy also is suspected in the deaths of up to 36 other women, most of them in 
the Pacific Northwest.

Police investigating the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner last month that killed 
270 people said today they have identified the baggage compartment where the 
explosive was hidden, information that would reveal when it was planted. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also know the names of passengers aboard Flight 103 whose luggage 
was packed in the baggage container and their backgrounds will be checked, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Chief Supt. John Orr refused to say if the plastic explosive was 
smuggled on board in Frankfurt, West Germany, where the Pan American World 
Airways flight originated, or at London's Heathrow Airport, where the flight 
and baggage changed planes to a Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have an indication as to where the baggage . . . came from but I don't 
think it would be helpful here at this time to be specific about it," said Orr, 
who heads the inquiry in the Scottish village of Lockerbie where the plane fell 
from the sky Dec. 21.

STATE JUDICIAL PANEL DROPS CASE AGAINST OC JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS and JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Commission on Judicial Performance announced today it will drop 
formal proceedings against Harbor Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter when his 
resignation becomes effective next month, on the condition that he not seek 
judicial office again or accept any appointment or assignment to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's decision to resign in mid-February was disclosed Monday. It follows 
four years of investigations of Carter and Harbor Municipal Judge Calvin P. 
Schmidt, first by Newport Beach police and the district attorney's office, and 
then by the state judicial commission. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations reportedly have centered on allegations that Carter and 
Schmidt misused their positions to help friends and to curry favor with 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's decision to resign came three weeks after the Commission on Judicial 
Performance sent the judge a list of the formal charges against him, commission 
spokesman Peter Gubbins said today. 
</P>
<P>
Gubbins would not reveal the details of those charges. Evidence would have been 
presented at the hearing by two officers from the attorney general's office, 
Gubbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Although such hearings have always been held secretly in the past, a voter 
initiative passed in November forced the commission to consider whether the 
Carter and Schmidt hearings should be held before the public, Gubbins said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schmidt Hearing Not Set 
</P>
<P>
Gubbins said no decision had been made about when Schmidt's hearing will be 
held, or whether it will be public. Schmidt could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Carter told former Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom on Monday that his 
resignation would be effective Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Gubbins said commission members believed it was pointless to go ahead with the 
hearing on Carter in light of his decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"Because commission hearings are lengthy and expensive to the state of 
California, the commission has determined that this disposition is in the 
public interest," Gubbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Had it found any of the allegations against Carter to be true after a formal 
hearing, the commission could have done no more than recommend to the state 
Supreme Court that he be censured, severely censured, suspended or removed from 
office.

A source close to Carter told The Times that Carter sent a letter to Gov. 
George Deukmejian on Friday tendering his resignation. The day before, in an 
interview with a Times reporter, Carter vehemently denied reports that he would 
resign before his commission hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he vowed to fight the allegations against him at the hearings. He had 
hired a noted Orange County trial lawyer and former judge, Byron K. McMillan, 
to represent him.

SANTA ANA MAN ARRESTED IN FATAL BEATING WITH BOTTLE

A Santa Ana man was arrested this morning after his wife was beaten to death 
with am empty champagne bottle. Their 13-month-old daughter, who was in her 
mother's arms during the beating, was on life support systems this morning with 
head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Peter Lynch, 43, called police about 12:30 a.m. today to say that 
someone had been killed at his apartment in the 700 block of West First Street, 
Santa Ana Police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found Helen Lynch, 35, on the living room floor, dead of massive head 
injuries. In her arms was the couple's daughter, Natalie Alexandra Lynch, who 
had also been beaten on the head with the bottle, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lynch initially told police that a neighbor had committed the crime, 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then he changed his stories and told police officers that he had, in fact, 
killed his wife," she said. "It was an extremely brutal attack." 
</P>
<P>
Police could not determine a motive for the slaying, but said it appeared they 
had drunk the champagne Monday night.

In an effort to curb prostitution along Harbor Boulevard, Santa Ana city 
officials said today that they will file a lawsuit in Orange County Superior 
Court to bar 300 convicted prostitutes and their customers from the 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking injunctions against the prostitutes and their customers, 
charging that they create a public nuisance. Those who have been convicted of 
prostitution or soliciting prostitutes would be summoned to court and told that 
if they are arrested, they will be charged with contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians immediately challenged the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a violation of constitutional rights to try and get people off the street 
merely for their criminal record and not for any present illegal conduct," said 
Rebecca Jurado, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.

BUSINESS INVENTORIES, SALES UP 0.4% IN NOV.

<P>
Business inventories rose 0.4% in November and sales rose at the same pace, the 
government said today in a report that analysts said bodes well for the 
nation's economy in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots rose to 
a seasonally adjusted $753.6 billion in November, while sales reached $503.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The matching 0.4% gains kept the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.50, meaning 
it would take a month and a half to exhaust inventories at the November sales 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can signal 
economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order production cuts 
and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods. 
</P>
<P>
But John Hagens of Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the new report 
indicates that "at least from the inventories point of view, we think the 
economy is in pretty good shape for continued growth in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, before a recession, inventories tend to build up," he said. 
"There's no evidence of any kind of excesses in inventories in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follows Earlier Rise 
</P>
<P>
The November increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise during October 
and a 0.9% jump in September. It was the 23rd straight month in which 
inventories had risen, but sales generally have kept pace. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase in sales was down from a 1.3% increase in October and 
virtually unchanged sales activity in September.

ROTHSCHILD CITES LACK OF PROFITS, DROPS OUT AS PRIMARY U.S. DEALER 
</P>

L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co. Inc. said today it has withdrawn as a primary 
dealer, making it the second institution in less than a week to defect from the 
exclusive club of bond dealers that trade directly with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild, a subsidiary of L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., said its departure, 
which will leave 44 primary dealers to trade with the Federal Reserve, is 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scope of Decision Told 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild also said it will discontinue its U.S. government securities sales 
and trading activities except for trading in its own account. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild said that, while its capital exceeds the Federal Reserve's new 
requirements for primary dealers, the return on capital devoted to its 
government securities operations has been insufficient to warrant continuation 
of the business. 
</P>
<P>
A rumor that Rothschild would leave the primary dealer business circulated 
widely on Friday when County Natwest Government Securities Inc., a subsidiary 
of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, said it was quitting the 
overcrowded and often unprofitable business. 
</P>
<P>
County Natwest had been a primary dealer for less than four months when it made 
its surprise announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Primary dealerships are special rights granted by the Federal Reserve to deal 
directly with the government when it issues debt securities. The 
once-prestigious role as the government-sanctioned bond dealer has been losing 
its appeal as intense competition cuts profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers say that at least half of the primary dealers were not profitable in 
1988. Some say that only seven firms made profits.

American Airlines is expected to announce two aircraft orders for 160 airplanes 
worth $7.4 billion, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today. 
</P>
<P>
American spokesman Al Becker described the report as "highly speculative." 
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the airline, owner of the largest commercial jet 
fleet in the non-Communist world, will order 60 long-range McDonnell Douglas 
MD-11s for an estimated $5.4 billion and 100 domestic-range MD-80s for an 
estimated $2 billion more. Both aircraft are produced in the McDonnell Douglas 
facility in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
American decided to buy the MD-11, which has yet to make its first flight, 
instead of the Boeing 747-400, the newest, largest and longest-range of Boeing 
Commercial Airplane Co.'s line of jumbo jets, the newspaper quoted Wall Street 
and industry sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The two deals will be announced within the next three weeks, as soon as final 
language of the contract is worked out, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the report, Becker said: "We have not signed any agreements 
nor have we made any deals with either of the aircraft manufacturers, and we 
have no announcements imminent.

U.S. OIL AT 14-MONTH HIGH, TOPS $19 A BARREL 
</P>

<P>
U.S. oil prices topped $19 a barrel today, the first time they have surpassed 
that level in 14 months as traders increasingly believe that OPEC will adhere 
to new production limits. 
</P>
<P>
In morning trading, the February contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose to $19.02 a barrel, up 14 cents from Monday's close. Prices last closed 
over $19 on Nov. 4, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were subject 
to new output limits of 18.5 million barrels daily beginning Jan. 1, as the 
cartel tried to end the high production that had sent world oil prices 
tumbling. In December the OPEC members produced an estimated 22.5 million 
barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
The pact, which replaced lower limits that were widely ignored, was agreed in 
late November. Since then, prices have risen nearly $4 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But the surge above $19 seemed to make some traders nervous. Prices later 
retreated slightly and were hovering just under the key level in early 
afternoon trading, with the February contract at $18.98 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is backing off on light volume," said one trader. "Traders are 
taking some profits." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Platt, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the recent rally in prices 
made the market vulnerable to some profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
Among other grades of oil, North Sea Brent crude was up about 15 cents at 
$17.15 a barrel for February delivery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Demand Boosts Market 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the signs of OPEC restraint, the market has also been buoyed by 
strong demand for oil products. 
</P>
<P>
The government's Energy Information Administration reported Monday that total 
products supplied in the four weeks ended Dec. 30 were up 4.9% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The brisk sales pace was expected to be carried through to the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products failed to share in the enthusiasm for crude, however. The 
February heating oil contract was down 0.41 of a cent at 52 3/4 cents a gallon, 
due to relatively warm temperatures in much of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline was also lower, with unleaded gas down 0.21 of a cent at 50 3/4 cents 
a gallon.

Several members of the New Mexico State basketball team suffered minor injuries 
after their van was struck and rolled over once at a foggy intersection near 
the Fresno airport, Fresno police said. 
</P>
<P>
Visibility was reported to be near zero about 7:25 a.m. today when a van driven 
by Kenneth Smith of New Mexico reportedly ran a red light and was broadsided by 
a car driven by Rachel Avila of Fresno, police reported. The coach, five 
players and the team's sports information director were in the van and were to 
be released from Fresno Community Hospital before noon today, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Avila and her two passengers were reported in fair condition at Valley Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
A Fresno Community Hospital spokeswoman said three players were hurt: Jeff 
McCool with a neck injury; Willie Joseph with a back injury and Steve McGlothin 
with a knee injury. Sports information director Steve Shutt suffered bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the accident occurred while the team's van was heading eastbound on 
McKinley Avenue toward the Fresno airport. The van apparently ran a red light 
at the intersection of Cedar Avenue, was struck and rolled once, coming to rest 
on the roof, police said.
