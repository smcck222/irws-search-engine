ANGRY FAMILIES OF VICTIMS STILL WAIT FOR JUSTICE

Exasperated with a court system that has refused to pronounce Robert Alton 
Harris' case finally over, the families of the two boys he killed said Tuesday 
it was too much to hope that Harris actually would be executed as soon as March 
or April. 
</P>
<P>
"After 11 years, I'm not bringing out the Champagne yet," said John Mayeski's 
mother, Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, 68, a former civilian electronics technician 
with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Baker, Michael Baker's father, said he shares that caution. "There have 
been so many appeals, and the thing has dragged on for so long, I've told 
reporters before that I won't get excited until I get my plane ticket up to 
Frisco" to witness the execution at San Quentin, said Baker, a San Diego police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the families welcomed Tuesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision removing one 
of the last legal roadblocks to Harris' execution. 
</P>
<P>
"When this is finally over, it will all get put to rest," said John Mayeski's 
uncle, William Stalder, retired after 28 years as a gardener for San Diego city 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by Steve Baker, then a patrol officer, who 
did not know that earlier in the day Harris had killed Baker's son and 
Michael's friend, John. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boys had been eating hamburgers in the parking lot of a Jack in 
the Box in San Diego's Mira Mesa neighborhood when Harris kidnaped them at 
gunpoint so he could steal their car and use it in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed 
them. Later, he ate their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. The U.S. 
Supreme Court refused Tuesday to hear the latest of Harris' appeals of that 
sentence, the fourth time the high court has turned down an appeal in Harris' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Harris filed yet another appeal, this one with the 
California Supreme Court, urging a reversal of his death sentence. In that 
appeal, Harris argued that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to kill him 
because he had changed for the better in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"You want a rebuttal to that? It was cruel and unusual and unnecessary 
punishment to take another person's life, two person's lives," said Stalder, 
John Mayeski's uncle. "Why should (Harris) have life and another person not? 
The Book says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." 
</P>
<P>
Stalder's sister, Sanders, who has remarried and moved to rural North San Diego 
County from the Mira Mesa neighborhood where she raised John Mayeski, said she 
is "disgusted with the system, for the simple reason that it's taken so long." 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that sometimes the wrong person can be accused, but when a 
man admits it six times, and they know he did it, I don't know what the holdup 
is," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Baker, 47, now a San Diego police robbery detective, said he wishes 
Harris' appeals had been "taken care of in a year's time." 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line for myself, and I think for most of the public and police 
officers, is you do a crime, you do the time," Baker said. "I think the bottom 
line with what's wrong with the system is that it's run by attorneys. An 
attorney's job is to talk you to death. 
</P>
<P>
"The more they drag this out, the more money somebody's making on it. Enough's 
enough. This is ridiculous. Let's get this thing done." 
</P>
<P>
Harris' prosecutor, now an appellate court judge, said he can understand that 
the appeals process in Harris' case has produced extreme frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that obviously one wants to very carefully examine any capital case," 
said Richard Huffman, former chief deputy district attorney and now a judge on 
the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make sure that, not only is the decision correct but it was 
correctly arrived at, but I think realistically we've known that in Robert 
Harris' case since the California Supreme Court affirmed the decision in 1981," 
Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I, like a lot of people, will just be glad the review process appears to be 
winding down," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he has been "guaranteed" to be one of the official witnesses at 
Harris' execution, should it occur. 
</P>
<P>
Stalder said he'd "like to go up and watch it. I've put in my bid for it. Hell, 
I'd pull the switch." 
</P>
<P>
But Kathryn Mayeski said she is not interested in watching Harris go to the gas 
chamber for her son's death. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a man, I'd go," she said. "But I think I've gone through enough." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the two boys said repeatedly that it has been emotionally 
wrenching to hear of Harris' continuous appeals because the lengthy delay has 
blocked their ability to end their grief. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Baker said he wants to see "the end to this entire ordeal." The pain is 
just as vivid as when his son died and "maybe more so now, because of the 
frustration being built into the lack of punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"If this (the appeal rejected Tuesday) is the last major one, it'll be a 
relief," said John Mayeski's sister, Kathryn Clark, 45, a nursing assistant in 
Maryland. "And, when the day of execution comes, that will be another relief. 
Then I'll see some justice done, and my brother might be able to rest in 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Kathryn Sanders said, the "pain is just as new and fresh as when it 
just happened." 
</P>
<P>
"All I have to see is a name like Harris or a kid named John or a couple kids 
riding on a scooter and your mind goes right back to the whole thing all over 
again," she said. "I think, gee, that could have been my John."

Intel Corp.: The Santa Clara, Calif., producer of microcomputer chips said 1989 
full-year net income dropped 13.7% to $391 million, while revenue rose 9% to a 
record $3.1 billion. The firm blamed the closure of two of its oldest chip 
fabrication plants in part for the drop in earnings.

Rockwell International Corp.: First-quarter income fell 9% to $145.8 million 
from a year ago on sales of $2.9 billion, up about 3%. The El Segundo-based 
electronics and aerospace firm said results were affected by lower interest 
income and higher interest expense. Although its electronics businesses 
improved, earnings for its automotive segment were down substantially, the firm 
said.

Advanced Micro Devices: The Sunnyvale, Calif., integrated circuit maker said 
net income in fiscal 1989 totaled $46 million, more than double the $19 million 
of fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were down 1.9% to $1.1 billion. The fiscal 1988 results included an 
unusual charge of $17.3 million associated with a work force reduction, closure 
of a manufacturing plant and other restructuring actions. The company said the 
increased earnings were due in part to driving unit costs down and an increase 
in international sales.

CO-OP NURSERY SCHOOLS' TEST OF FAITH;

DAY CARE: MANY PARENT-RUN SCHOOLS RELY ON CHURCHES FOR SPACE, BUT THEY ARE 
BEING FORCED OUT SO CHURCHES CAN RUN THEIR OWN CENTERS.

<P>
In a nursery school playroom in northwest Pasadena, Rick Hopper chuckles in 
approval as his 3-year-old son, David, slots the final piece into a jigsaw 
puzzle 
</P>
<P>
For young David, it has always been a treat when his parents come to school. 
And Daddy is not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"He really gets excited when he knows one of us is going to be here," said the 
35-year-old financial planner, who has taken the morning off work for his 
twice-monthly tour of duty at the Altadena Parent Participation Nursery School 
where David plays two mornings a week. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me time to spend with him," said Hopper, one of five parents 
responsible for mopping floors, supplying snacks and helping three professional 
teachers on a recent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the parent-run co-op on the grounds of the First Lutheran Church soon may 
lose its home. The school, begun in Altadena 40 years ago, will have to close 
if it cannot find a new location by fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're desperately trying to find a space," said Sarah Craighead, president of 
the 50-student nursery that has been housed for five years in a peach-colored 
building with a red clay tile roof. 
</P>
<P>
"We may just cease to exist if summer comes and we don't have anything," said 
Craighead, who, since learning the news in November, has sent letters to 28 
churches in Pasadena and Altadena asking if anyone has room. "We'd consider 
meeting in a park." 
</P>
<P>
The church wants to set up its own preschool in the 2,500-square-foot building 
in an effort to attract new and younger parishioners to its shrinking 
200-member congregation, Pastor Robert Faga said. The church collects $600 a 
month in rent from the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to reach out to the people," he said, pointing out that he would like 
to see tighter ties with parents and a greater emphasis on religious teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now a secular school. We have no spiritual contact with (students' 
families) at all," Faga said. "We would like to be closer to them." 
</P>
<P>
But Altadena Nursery director and teacher Pat Hedland, 64, said staying 
nondenominational is important because she does not want to alienate anyone. 
The school celebrates Easter and Hanukkah as cultural events "so children don't 
have to feel they're different," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these things are important for children to know," she continued. "We 
try not to limit ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of remaining religiously neutral in a church facility is not new to 
nursery schools on short-term leases. Last January the 48-student Diamond Bar 
Community Nursery School was asked to vacate its location at a church that 
wants to start its own day-care center next year. 
</P>
<P>
A relocation committee of parents has contacted more than 60 churches in the 
vicinity -- but so far no luck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough," said Susie Roberts, a vice president of the school. "We had a 
very large mailing list, and the response was just nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Other complications are the Department of Social Services' requirements on 
minimum space per child, bathroom accessibility and availability of drinking 
water in every room. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-student Crescenta-Canada Nursery School met for three months in a park 
in 1988 before finding a new location in La Canada Flintridge. The Montrose 
church in which the nursery had been located for 30 years had wanted a hand in 
operating the school. "But we wanted it parent-run," said school President 
Kathy Lockridge, explaining why they left. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of a facility ranks among the schools' top headaches, said Susan King, 
president of the 300-member California Council of Parent Participation Nursery 
Schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of schools close because of the inability to find a new 
location," King said, adding that about 10 schools in the state shut down each 
year. More than a third of the approximately 400 parent-participation nursery 
schools in the state lease space from churches. 
</P>
<P>
Parent co-ops, which originated in Europe and were introduced to California in 
the 1920s, are required by the state Department of Social Services to maintain 
an adult-child ratio of 1 to 5, as opposed to the 1-to-12 teacher-child ratio 
required for traditional nurseries licensed by the state, King said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents seem hooked on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Warrick, whose 3-year-old daughter attends Altadena Nursery, one of 12 
such co-ops in the San Gabriel Valley, said the warm atmosphere at the school 
makes her feel as if she is with family. 
</P>
<P>
"We trust and we know one another, and it's so much fun," she said, adding that 
she values the companionship of other parents, who help each other cope with 
discipline problems and with the isolation of being full-time mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The experience also provides good on-the-job training in parenting. "You see 
how other people that don't have blood relations to these urchins deal with 
them," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, who pay between $48 and $96 a month, depending on how many days a week 
their child attends, also believe this kind of nursery school is safer. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a co-op is real comforting for parents in the days of the McMartin 
trial and other horrible stories (of child abuse) in day care," Warrick said. 
Child abuse would be "almost impossible here because all the parents are 
there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 65 parents and grandparents, most of them women, are rotated on duty 
rosters at the school. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of them are working parents. They are also enthusiastic about 
having a say in running the school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of trouble, but it's worth it," said Mary Lou Byrne, an attorney 
who takes mornings off twice a month to work with the 2- to 4-year-olds. "It 
eases your guilt somehow," she said about being able to spend more time with 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
Although her toddler was not too perturbed when told about having to leave the 
facility, she thinks he might become more concerned as the day draws closer. 
</P>
<P>
"For a 3-year-old, nine months is a zillion years away," Byrne said. But, she 
added, "the parents are terribly upset." 
</P>
<P>
Hedland, who has seen the school through two moves in the 30 years she has been 
affiliated with it as mother and teacher, said she is determined to find a way 
for Altadena Nursery School to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"This school is too wonderful," she said, promising that she will not let the 
children go without a struggle. "I'll take them home with me if I have to."

CAMPUS RADIO STATION IS ON AN 'ALTERNATIVE' WAVELENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one could accuse Pomona College student radio station KSPC of going 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Bands like Headless Chickens and Dog Bowl compete for air time with reggae and 
rap segments. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners in Lakewood tune in for the polka hours. 
</P>
<P>
And deejays would not dream of playing Madonna, Paula Abdul or U2 on this 
"alternative" station, situated to the far left of the FM dial at 88.7. 
</P>
<P>
With 3,000 watts of power, KSPC has one of the strongest signals of any 
student-run college radio station in the area, with a listening radius of 35 
miles and an estimated audience of about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, hardly anybody on campus tunes in. 
</P>
<P>
"KSPC. It's a radio station, isn't it?" said Hi Chang Choi, 20, a junior at the 
college, interviewed recently while he was having a Swiss burger at the Student 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
His comment was partly sarcastic but partly a reflection of KSPC's standing on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of Pomona students conducted by the Student Senate last year found 
that fewer than 40% of those surveyed listen to KSPC for more than an hour a 
week. The survey found that about 65% of the students surveyed believe that the 
station should better serve the college community. 
</P>
<P>
"Three people said 'Blow the damn thing up,' and a lot of people said they 
wanted to change the station," said Brian Azevedo, a member of the Student 
Senate who would like to see KSPC's format changed to something more 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to make KSPC a bit more responsive to the students," said 
Azevedo, a sophomore transfer student from the University of Texas. "I guess 
that it's just that the community that KSPC serves isn't necessarily the 
community that is paying for KSPC." 
</P>
<P>
Azevedo persuaded the Student Senate to include questions about KSPC on the 
survey, which was distributed in campus dining halls and also included queries 
on other topics. He said he has no concrete plans for changing the station's 
format but believes that the tastes of more of the college's 1,400 students 
should go into deciding what is played. 
</P>
<P>
However, students who work at the station defend their playing of the likes of 
Big Black and Firehose. Such alternative rock accounts for half the music 
played on KSPC. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough good music that is not mainstream that there's no particular 
obligation for us to play mainstream," said Franklin Bruno, the music director. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vodika, a Pomona graduate and former deejay for the station, added: 
"There's just all kinds of music from all over the world, virtually, that 
doesn't get played on commercial radio stations and even most college stations. 
And KSPC is a forum for that music to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
Even the station's non-rock offerings are a bit unusual. But they also have 
their passionate partisans. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits is the polka show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of ritual with us on Saturday and Sunday mornings," said William 
Workman, 60, of Covina, who listens to the shows with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Workman explained that "they play some real way-out ethnic stuff," such as 
Serbo-Croatian and Gypsy music. 
</P>
<P>
"Polkas don't all sound alike except to the person that's never heard one 
before," he commented. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular show, "The Boss Guy in Claremont," airs Sunday night and 
showcases alternative music from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"It really plays what I listened to during the '60s as opposed to what passes 
for that today on classic rock stations," said Darrel Frank of Placentia, who 
calls himself a "huge fan" of the show. He points to artists like the Savoy 
Brown Blues Band and Roy Gallagher and to big-name performers' lesser-known 
songs that are overlooked by most commercial stations. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's funk rap show also has a loyal following, said Julie Frick, the 
station's director and only paid full-time staff member. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, we're not here just for the college students," said KSPC deejay 
Erik McGuinness, a Pitzer College senior who is eligible to work at the station 
because his school, like Pomona, is one of the Claremont Colleges. "We have a 
wide listenership, much larger than the college students." 
</P>
<P>
As for McGuinness, he acknowledges that the alternative rock he plays is not 
for everyone. "If you are a woman who is easily offended, perhaps you should 
plug your ears for this one," he tells his listeners as he spins the hit 
"Sleazeball," the latest from the band Zoogz Rift. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all pretty random," said McGuinness, who became interested in alternative 
rock at first because "it was funny" with "a lot of cheesy and ridiculous" 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a proponent of variety over quality, myself," McGuinness said. 
</P>
<P>
Among local colleges, KSPC's broadcasting power is equalled only by Loyola 
Marymount University's KXLU, which plays an eclectic mix of educational, hard 
rock, jazz and classical programming. 
</P>
<P>
KSCR, the student-run radio station at USC, does not "shy away from artists 
just because they're considered commercial," said music director Raymond So. 
However, the station, whose only broadcast outlet is a campus dining hall, also 
plays "new artists that commercial radio wouldn't touch," So said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of KSPC's annual budget of more than $60,000 comes from the Student Senate 
budget, but most -- 75% -- comes from school administration. The station's 
budget is justified because it gives almost 100 volunteer student deejays and 
staffers an extracurricular activity and because it boosts the college's name 
recognition by broadcasting it often, Frick said. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's that music. 
</P>
<P>
"This music is really by some of the most vital and important artists around," 
Vodika said, "and it's not on television, not at the movies, and not on 
mainstream radio."

FINANCIALLY TROUBLED LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE SAYS IT WILL MANAGE A '90 SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: A FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN SURPASSED ITS INITIAL GOAL OF $500,000, BUT 
THERE'S STILL ANOTHER $440,000 TO GO, AND NOBODY IS BREATHING EASY YET.

<P>
There will be a 1990 season for the financially beleaguered La Jolla Playhouse, 
representatives of the theater said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which has been laboring under a $703,000 deficit that accrued from 
1986 to 1988, announced in September the need to raise $500,000 by Dec. 31 to 
ensure the season and $500,000 more by June 30 to achieve financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
The organization raised $560,000 in gifts and pledges by Dec. 31. The plays for 
the season are likely to be announced sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased that we were able to make the goal that we set for 
ourselves and that the 1990 season is assured as a result of that goal," said 
Alan Levey, managing director of the playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Fund raising is always stressful," Levey said. "There's no one taking a deep 
breath of relief. Raising that (remaining) $440,000, along with raising our 
annual contributed income needs (about $1.6 million, or 50% of the total 
budget), is not a slam-dunk. But that's what all arts organizations are up 
against." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign also met another goal of broadening the theater's support by 
drawing pledges and donations from more than 1,000 contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse, founded in 1947 as a summer stock theater by Hollywood 
actors Gregory Peck (a native La Jollan), Dorothy McGuire and Mel Ferrer, 
closed in 1964 and was revived in 1983 as a fully professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
From its rebirth, under the guidance of Artistic Director Des McAnuff, it 
stunned conservative San Diego theatergoers with the visual surprises of its 
opening show, "The Visions of Simone Machard," a modern Joan of Arc story by 
Bertolt Brecht. Times theater critic Dan Sullivan described the play, directed 
by controversial wunderkind Peter Sellars, as "not just far out, but far up," 
as some scenes were staged on a catwalk above the audience's heads. 
</P>
<P>
In its second year, the playhouse became the first San Diego theater to produce 
a show that would make its mark on Broadway -- "Big River," a musical version 
of "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," directed by McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
The show won seven Tony awards in 1985, including one for McAnuff. In ensuing 
years, the playhouse and the Old Globe Theatre helped build a national 
reputation for San Diego theater. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the playhouse began its long financial slide. The budget, which 
began at $1.2 million for a three-play season in 1983, grew to $2.3 million for 
a five-play season in 1986 and $3.6 million for a six-play season in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse lagged in its projections for single ticket sales in 1989 and 
found that its dependence on a handful of generous donors, including Mandell 
Weiss -- principal donor for the Mandell Weiss Theatre, where the playhouse 
performs -- could not sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
Another financial blow was dealt by a delay in the building of the 400-seat 
Mandell Weiss Forum, which would have provided more than 100 additional seats 
to sell during the 1990 season. The forum is now scheduled to be built in time 
for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
One board member confided privately to The Times concerns that the playhouse 
was spending too much money on individual productions. But managing director 
Levey blamed the financial problems on the expense of producing too short a 
season in two venues of unequal size, the 492-seat Mandell Weiss Theatre and 
the 248-seat Warren Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The problem should be alleviated when the Mandell Weiss Forum replaces the 
Warren, Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
The length of the La Jolla Playhouse season -- six months in 1989 and 1990 -- 
is limited by the playhouse's agreement to share both its facilities with UC 
San Diego. The theater's seasons from 1983 to 1986 were summer seasons. That 
grew to a five-month season in 1988 and six months in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The season is likely to stay at six months in 1990 and until plans for a third 
theater can be realized, Levey said.

GOMEZ-PENA PRODUCES SOME BORDER WITCHCRAFT 
</P>

<P>
Two men -- one Mexican, the other Jewish -- are swapping stories in a 
restaurant that has a French name and a Continental menu. As he dines on 
Italian food, the Mexican talks about a recent visit to New York City, where he 
found chiles poblanos in Brooklyn and a churro stand at a subway station. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish man, who has spent most of his life in the Southern California 
border region, alternates between Spanish and English as he tells a story about 
discovering a relative in Syracuse, N.Y. The Mexican counters with a tale about 
a compatriot who discovered a relative in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
There's no punch line to this series of unlikely scenarios, but there is a 
message: the world is becoming one big culture clash. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant patrons were writer-performer Guillermo Gomez-Pena and film 
maker Isaac Artenstein. The artists are preparing for the world premiere of 
their collaboration, a multimedia performance piece entitled "Border Brujo II." 
A brujo is a warlock or shaman. The premiere is being held, appropriately, in 
San Diego, where culture clashes are bred daily. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena illustrates these clashes by violently and repeatedly smashing his 
fists together. The sudden action energizes the room and sparks a 
transformation in the self-proclaimed "Border Brujo." 
</P>
<P>
"Brujos can practice lycanthropy," says Gomez-Pena with a gleam in his eyes. 
"That's what the border does. It makes you be other things." 
</P>
<P>
The border has made Gomez-Pena an award-winning performer. The original version 
of "Border Brujo" won him prizes at last year's International Theatre Festival 
of the Americas in Montreal and in the New York Dance and Performance Awards. 
He has performed the piece throughout the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Saturday at Sushi Performance Gallery, Gomez-Pena will perform 
the new version, a work-in-progress that incorporates a film produced and 
directed by Artenstein. The two artists were founding members of the Border 
Arts Workshop and the film is a result of their six-year collaboration. 
Eventually, the film will be distributed as a feature -- a creative 
documentation of Gomez-Pena's tour de force performance as a shaman who is the 
product of "the broken line," "the infected wound," "the umbilical cord": 
Gomez-Pena's descriptions of the border, where, as Artenstein says, "the first 
and the third worlds come together." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's work revolves around language. He is a prolific writer, and his 
performances, whether on stage or across a cafe table, are verbal vortexes. In 
"Border Brujo," he speaks Spanish, English, "Spanglish," "Inglenol," and 
Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. It is an attempt, he says, "to create 
three simultaneous discourses of communication." He is especially intrigued by 
the audience's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I speak English, there is a sense of confrontation," he said. "When I 
speak Spanish, there is a sense of tenderness. And, when the text is bilingual, 
there is a sense of complicity." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena is an accomplice, and a willing one at that. The role of the brujo, 
he says, is "to guide other people through the border." It's seldom a peaceful 
journey. Sometimes, his performance has drawn responses that are "distrustful 
and aggressive . . . from people who are threatened by the presence of Latinos 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested in polarizing these issues because I think I can create a 
dialogue. Especially because the wounds are still fresh and open." 
</P>
<P>
He also speaks of reaching the people "who have escaped monolinguality and 
monoculturalism. Most of the inhabitants of this region are like that. Every 
time I come back, I am struck by the complexity of their lives -- the spiral 
journeys." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena's own journey started in his native Mexico City. "We thought of the 
border as all the stereotypes imaginable," he said. "We were victimized by 
misconceptions about the border. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid-'70s, we were children of crisis in Mexico City, a generation 
disillusioned. Many went to Paris and Madrid, but many of us felt more American 
than European. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the prism of art, Mexican artists changed their perception of Chicano 
and border art." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez-Pena moved to Los Angeles in 1978. He worked as a journalist for 
Spanish-language newspapers and attended the California Institute of the Arts 
in Valencia. He moved to San Diego, and soon began collaborating with a group 
of artists who were inspired by the presence of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a grass-roots, cross-cultural, utopian effort," Gomez-Pena says of the 
Border Arts Workshop's origins in the early to mid-'80s. "No one was claiming 
the border as a laboratory of cultural experimentation. We created a monster." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The workshop has garnered much critical acclaim and was recently the 
subject of an "Art in America" cover story. The genesis of "Border Brujo" came 
from the workshop's 1988 "Border Realities" exhibit at the Centro Cultural de 
la Raza. However, Gomez-Pena and Artenstein no longer claim membership in the 
workshop, preferring to go their own way as they allege an appropriation of 
their turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Museums are getting huge grants for border art when we couldn't get arrested 
for doing it," said Artenstein, referring to the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art's recent receipt of a $250,000 National Endowment for the Arts 
grant for a border art project. 
</P>
<P>
The institutionalization of border art is yet another irony, another dichotomy 
for these artists. But it's to be expected in a land where ironies and culture 
clashes abound. Consider this one: In his cluttered studio at Sushi, Gomez-Pena 
is surrounded by papers, posters, pictures and other paraphernalia relating to 
the border. This is the inner sanctum, the temple of border lore. At night you 
may see a faint light emanating from the second-story window. The border brujo 
is there, engrossed in ritual, conjuring his mystic visions as he sits before 
the shrine of the times -- a computer.

Hit Show: "Secrets, Dialogues, Revelations: The Art of Betye and Alison Saar," 
the first joint exhibition by the Los Angeles veteran artist Betye and her now 
New York-based daughter Alison, looks to be one of UCLA Wight Art Gallery's 
best attended shows in recent years. According to figures released Tuesday, 
2,266 attended the show in its first week. Already, attendance at the Saar show 
has equalled "Twelve Artists From the German Democratic Republic," which has 
been on view at UCLA since Dec. 5. CLAUDIA PUIG

Reporting Late: The Hollywood Reporter, which prides itself on being first each 
morning to bring entertainment industry news to its 23,000 readers, had trouble 
getting out of the starting gate Tuesday with its special 204-page issue on 
film and television music. 
</P>
<P>
While receptionists fielded anxious calls from studio subscribers, there was 
some confusion in-house over the reasons behind the tardy distribution. A 
spokesperson for managing editor Glenn Abel blamed the lateness on "a problem 
with one of our printing vendors" while business manager Michael Leonard 
claimed the oversize issue simply took a long time to print. "I can't really go 
into details over the phone," Leonard said. "You could be from Variety."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: RECORD STORE WILL EXHIBIT 
JOHN LENNON'S EROTIC ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When John Lennon was felled by an assassin's bullet in December, 1980, the 
world lost not only a legendary pop musician but an accomplished artist. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the recently opened Off the Record store in Hillcrest will host a 
monthlong exhibition of lithographs, etchings, serigraphs and sculptures by the 
celebrated ex-Beatle. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of "The Art of John Lennon," which opens Feb. 3, is a complete 
"Bag One Suite," a set of 14 lithographs of sketches depicting Lennon's early 
life with and marriage to Yoko Ono. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the suite is erotic lithos of John and Yoko," said Off the Record 
co-owner Rich Horowitz. "When they were first being shown in London in 1970, 
the show was closed down, and there was even an unsuccessful pornography suit 
filed against Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, 300 suites were produced, but over the last 20 years many of them 
have been broken up by people selling individual pieces. And today, no one 
knows how many complete suites are left; the estimate is fewer than half." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will also feature five other limited-edition suites of 
lithographs, etchings and serigraphs. "These were all taken from original 
Lennon drawings and released by Yoko after his death," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, there will be several neons and sculptures designed by 
Lennon and "a whole array of licensed boutique items -- like Lennon sweat 
shirts, posters, note pads and mugs -- put out by the Lennon estate." 
</P>
<P>
Everything's for sale, Horowitz said. "Bag One Suite" lithos will be priced 
from $4,000 to $12,000 apiece; other items will "probably be more in the $400 
to $800 range," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said the idea for the exhibition came to him two months ago, when he 
was in Laguna Beach, viewing an exhibit of etchings by Rolling Stones guitarist 
Ron Wood at the Pacific Edge gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back down to San Diego with the notion that this town is in dire need 
of a place to show rock 'n' roll art," Horowitz said. "So I contacted (Pacific 
Edge owner) Paul Jillson to see if he would be interested in doing a show 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"He was, and I suggested a Lennon exhibition. I've been a fan of his work for 
many years, and I thought our new store in Hillcrest would be incredibly 
conducive to this sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"So we made some plans, contacted the Lennon estate in New York, and they were 
behind it 100%, and then put the whole thing into motion." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said he considers "The Art of John Lennon" exhibition something of an 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is as successful as we anticipate, we're going to do other rock 'n' 
roll art shows in the future," he said. "Ron Wood has done a series of what are 
called dry-point etchings of the Stones, Sam Cooke, people like that, as well 
as collages of rock stars from the 1950s, '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, who is also an artist in his own 
right, and Neon Parks, who designed the Little Feat album covers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to bring more of this kind of stuff down to San Diego, and I'm ready 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In a career that spans more than two decades, Todd Rundgren, appearing Thursday 
night at the California Theatre downtown, has established himself as something 
of a rock 'n' roll Renaissance man. 
</P>
<P>
Despite limited commercial success -- only one gold album, "Something/Anything" 
in 1972, and one gold single, 1973's "Hello, It's Me" -- Rundgren has gotten 
plenty of critical accolades for his studio virtuosity and eclecticism, both as 
a recording artist and as a producer. 
</P>
<P>
He surfaced in the late 1960s as the leader of the Nazz, a Philadelphia group 
with a decidedly Liverpudlian sound. By 1970, he was recording solo for 
Bearsville Records, and, with the release two years later of the landmark 
"Something/Anything" album -- on which he played nearly all the instruments and 
over-dubbed dozens of vocals -- Rundgren became increasingly willing to try 
just about anything in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the entire first side of 1976's "Faithful" consists of, well, 
faithful covers of such pop classics as the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations," the 
Yardbirds' "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago" and the Beatles' "Rain" and 
"Strawberry Fields Forever." On his 1980 album with Utopia, "Deface the Music," 
he parodied the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
On 1981's "Healing," Rundgren played every instrument. Aside from an occasional 
hand clap, all the sounds heard on 1985's "A Capella" were generated by a 
single instrument, his voice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the sound board, Rundgren has been just as eclectic. The 
disparate acts he had already produced by 1973 included Badfinger, the Paul 
Butterfield Blues Band, James Cotton, Grand Funk Railroad and the New York 
Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's produced albums for dozens of other acts, ranging from Patti 
Smith and Tom Robinson to the Tubes and Meat Loaf, from Hall and Oates to Shaun 
Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
Rundgren is now touring the country with a 13-piece band in support of his 
latest album, "Nearly Human." And when he stops in San Diego on Thursday night, 
you owe it to yourself to go. Renaissance men, after all, are few and far 
between -- particularly in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Two familiar faces in the crowd at last Friday night's El Vez show 
at the Casbah in Middletown: Mojo Nixon (wearing an Elvis Presley muumuu he 
purchased for $35 in a Memphis boutique across the street from Graceland) and 
San Diego newspaper magnate David Copley. Lest rumors start to fly, no, they 
didn't come together. . . . Thirteen years ago this week, expatriate San Diego 
singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop made his Top 40 debut with "Save It for a 
Rainy Day." . . . Joe Satriani's Feb. 3 concert at the California Theatre 
downtown has sold out, prompting the addition of a second show the next night. 
. . . Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday for Aerosmith and Skid Row's March 
2 appearance at the San Diego Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown and the 
Blonde Bruce Band, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; the Circle 
Jerks, Friday at Iguanas in Tijuana; Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Saturday at the 
California Theatre; Eek-A-Mouse, the Roughneck Posse and Teacher Richie, 
Saturday at the La Paloma Theater in Encinitas; Michael Martin Murphy, Sunday 
at Leo's Little Bit O' Country in San Marcos; Tyrone Davis, Sunday at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, and former Cream-mates Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, 
Jan. 22 at the Belly Up Tavern.

Cruise and Rogers Call it Quits: Actor Tom Cruise and actress-wife Mimi Rogers 
have decided to end their nearly three-year marriage, saying they have been 
unable to resolve undisclosed issues plaguing their relationship. Cruise, 27, 
and Rogers, 33, were married in New York on May 9, 1987. "While there have been 
very positive aspects to our marriage, there were some issues which could not 
be resolved even after working on them for a period of time," the couple's 
statement said. CLAUDIA PUIG

Donald J. Dustin's hands keep time with his words as he recalls the glory days 
more than a decade ago when he could field 200 musicians for the halftime show 
at a high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin, who resigned as band director at Locke High School in 1983 to become 
director of performing arts for the Los Angeles Unified School District, then 
settles back in his chair to deliver his dreary coda: "The band has about 70 
students now." 
</P>
<P>
The once-proud Locke marching band is only one casualty of a decline in music 
education at public schools in California that started 30 years ago and 
accelerated during the last decade. 
</P>

Although modest gains over the last two years hint that the decrescendo may be 
over, the recovery of music programs in the state's public schools could be a 
long time in coming. 
</P>
<P>
Shrinking budgets and a belief that music education was a frill have triggered 
a cutback of elementary and high school music programs in which generations of 
students were taught to appreciate music, as well as to sing and to play 
musical instruments. With fewer programs in place, it was no surprise that the 
number of music classes and music students had fallen to the lowest levels ever 
by the mid-1980s, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the number of students playing in high school bands and orchestras 
was cut in half between 1982 and 1986, from 124,549 to 64,989. The number of 
junior high and high school students taking other music courses dropped about 
25% during the same period, even though student enrollment in grades 7 to 12 
held steady at about 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the decline has been less dramatic. The percentage of junior and 
senior high students enrolled in music classes remained at about 30% from the 
end of World War II to the late 1950s, according to the U.S. Department of 
Education. But by 1960, enrollment had dropped to 28%, and by 1972 to 25%. In 
1981, the last year for which such numbers are available, only about 21% of 
students signed up for music courses, including band, orchestra and choir, as 
well as music appreciation, theory and history. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school orchestras, once a fixture at nearly every school in the 
state, either have been eliminated or have been drastically cut back since the 
late 1960s. In the Los Angeles school district, once considered a national 
leader in music education, only about one-fourth of the 420 elementary schools 
offer instrumental music instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when we had an instrumental and choral program at every 
school, with a regular music teacher assigned to every school, plus a traveling 
music teacher," Dustin said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the district has fewer than 25 instrumental music teachers for its 
elementary schools. Seventy-two traveling music teachers are assigned to 360 
elementary schools, and each teaches as many as 1,300 students a week. The 
remaining 60 elementary schools are on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"My long-term goal is one music teacher for every elementary school or at least 
one music teacher for every 600 students," Dustin said. That would require the 
hiring of at least 300 more music teachers, an expensive and unlikely prospect, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly one-hour lessons by Los Angeles elementary school music teachers are 
by necessity fast-paced. Fourth-graders, for example, listen to the teacher 
play a version of a traditional song such as "Shenandoah." The teacher explains 
briefly the concepts of melody and chord patterns. Then the children sing and 
dance to the music. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that an hour a week isn't nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't do the job that way. Cut the roots and the tree dies," said 
Dennis Davies, music director for the Arcadia Unified School District, which 
still employs 10 music teachers for its 10 schools and offers instrument 
lessons beginning in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Interest 
</P>
<P>
Many educators say the cutbacks at the elementary level are responsible for a 
lack of interest in music among high school students. In the Los Angeles school 
district, about 20% of students in grades 7 to 12 enrolled in music classes -- 
such as band, orchestra and choir -- between the end of World War II and 1978. 
Now, only 10% enroll in such classes, even though the number of music teachers 
has remained about the same over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1960, music was usually a daily lesson in Los Angeles schools. At that 
time, fourth-graders, for instance, would be taught to sing songs by their 
music teacher, who would also play classical music on phonographs for them. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also have come at the top. The number of supervisors heading music 
programs at California school districts fell from 400 in 1978 to a low of 41 in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Without those music supervisors -- whose job is to make sure that there are 
enough music teachers and instruments -- orchestra and other music classes 
became especially vulnerable to school boards looking for quick ways to save 
money, many music educators say. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the resulting sharp decline in the number of music-teaching 
positions available, college students in the last 10 years have avoided the 
field, college music educators say. Last summer, qualified music teachers could 
not be found for 38 available teaching positions around the state, said Judy 
Gunderson of the Southern California Band and Orchestra Assn., a nonprofit 
organization that promotes music programs at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say a rebound in music education may be in the works because of new 
requirements for admission to the state university system, an influx of Asian 
students and a renewed interest in adding music to statewide tests measuring 
students' achievement. Enrollment in music education statewide has risen by a 
few thousand for each of the last two years, they say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Persuasion 
</P>
<P>
"There is a slight turnaround, and we're optimistic and encouraged," said 
Francie Alexander, a state associate school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, himself a piano player, wants to 
start a $100,000 radio and television campaign to persuade the public of the 
importance of arts education. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to sell math, but when it comes to music, some people see it as 
a frill," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
A major renovation of music curricula could also come if music is added to the 
California Assessment Program, a battery of tests that show how individual 
schools compare in subjects such as math and reading, Alexander said. "What is 
tested is what gets taught," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A state task force on arts education, headed by state Assemblyman Sam Farr 
(D-Carmel), is preparing to release a report recommending that all high school 
students be required to complete a year of art and music before they can 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, high school students applying for admission to schools in 
the California State University system must complete two semesters of art and 
music. UC is considering a similar requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think public opinion is starting to support what arts educators have always 
known -- the arts contribute to thinking skills," said Joan Peterson, an arts 
consultant to the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Louis Harris last year found that 70% of U.S. parents say they would 
favor a small tax increase to give their children better education in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to asking for more money, said Donald Gunderson, music 
director at Los Altos High School in Hacienda Heights, "music teachers are the 
worst lobbyists in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson said his school's award-winning marching band has survived because of 
strong support by parents and alumni. After a season of football halftime 
shows, Gunderson said, the students break into smaller jazz and stage ensembles 
to perform more musically challenging pieces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Raise Money 
</P>
<P>
Community support also has allowed music programs to survive virtually 
unscathed in school districts such as Glendale, Long Beach and Burbank, despite 
fund cutbacks caused by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, as well as in the Palos Verdes Unified School District, parents 
formed local foundations to raise funds to pay for music teachers and programs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a brief period after Prop. 13 (was passed), instrumental music was reduced 
considerably," said Vic Pallos, a spokesman for the Glendale district. Now, the 
instrumental program in the elementary schools "has really made a comeback," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many educators attribute part of the resurgence to an influx of Asians into the 
community. "A lot of our Chinese and Korean students study the piano and a 
string instrument," said music director Davies of the Arcadia school district. 
</P>
<P>
A few bright spots also can be seen in the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Junior High School music teacher Yolanda Gardea said she used to take a 
brass band to nearby elementary schools, hoping to spark interest in her 
dwindling band and orchestra classes. "It was a real sales job." 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of trying to drum up business, the North Hollywood teacher turns 
away students. "I had 150 students four years ago, and now I have 225 in band 
and orchestra," Gardea said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more young Latinos aspiring to play in mariachi bands are 
enrolling in instrument classes, said Gardea and other Los Angeles-area music 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood eighth-grader Woody Malone, whose 5-foot, 6-inch frame is 
dwarfed by the 6-foot string bass that he has to lug home to practice, said he 
is taking music at Reed because he wants to learn jazz. Classmate Jessica 
Klatzker said she likes playing her viola because it is relaxing and has "a 
beautiful sound." 
</P>
<P>
Some music educators speculate that the decline of music education began with 
the 1957 launch of Sputnik. Parents and politicians, fearful of falling behind 
Soviet technology, demanded more emphasis on science and math at the expense of 
school arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sputnik ended a golden era of music in the 1950s," said Henry Use, a retired 
music director and co-chairman of the Legislative Action Coalition for Arts 
Education. "It stung the American pride, and people asked, 'If the Russians can 
do it, why can't we do it?' The perception was that we weren't putting out good 
engineers, and people called for more science and math requirements that took 
up music time." 
</P>
<P>
But it took more than a Soviet satellite to shoot down music education. Voters 
and their representatives also contributed to the decline. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature approved the state's 1983 school reform laws, enacted to 
toughen graduation requirements, students were given the choice of taking a 
foreign language instead of art or music. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're college-bound, you're going to take foreign language," said Su 
Stauffer, a Northern California parent and longtime music activist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the California Legislature eliminated all music requirements for 
prospective teachers, who previously were expected to read music, sing and play 
an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
That change, which was included in legislation creating the state Commission on 
Teacher Credentialing, probably happened by accident, said Ken Lane, head of 
teacher training at UC Berkeley's School of Education. Legislators working on 
the changes wanted to simplify the credentialing process, as well as to 
increase teacher training in subjects such as math, science and English, Lane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be a demotion for music," said Lane, who wrote his 
dissertation on the 1970 Ryan Act, which established state 
teacher-credentialing laws. 
</P>
<P>
Music appreciation, which traditionally had included memorizing classical music 
and composers, was discarded from the curriculum at most school districts at 
about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
With few specially trained music teachers available, most elementary schools 
have had to rely on regular classroom teachers for music instruction, even 
though most of them have little or no training in music. 
</P>
<P>
"Elementary school teachers are not prepared to teach music," said Cecilia 
Riddell, who teaches a music course at Cal State Dominguez Hills. "They take a 
one-unit course from me, which is supposed to teach them all they need to know 
about singing, listening, folk dances and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, said Riddell -- who has taught music to classroom 
teachers for 25 years -- is that the current generation of college students 
training to be teachers learned little themselves about music in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up in Redwood City there was a certain body of literature that 
everybody was expected to know," said Riddell, who attended elementary school 
shortly after the end of World War II. "Pieces like . . . the overture to 'The 
Magic Flute' by Mozart, the 'Nutcracker Suite.' Now, I'm astonished how many of 
my students have never even heard 'Peter and the Wolf.' "

U.S. MUST HELP PANAMA'S RECOVERY, ENDARA WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Guillermo Endara warned Tuesday that if the United States fails to 
provide sufficient economic aid for his government, all of the effort put into 
deposing dictator Manuel A. Noriega will have been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"People will probably seek solutions outside the democratic process; they will 
think that Noriega's times were better times," he told senior editors and 
correspondents of The Times in an hourlong interview. 
</P>
<P>
"All our efforts will be lost . . . all will be shattered," including the gains 
made from the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion, Endara cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "for us, the United States' reaction is slow, very slow," Endara 
said he plans to make a personal appeal to President Bush in Washington before 
Bush's State of the Union address Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government is seeking $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to help it 
recover not only from the damage of the invasion but also from the economic 
wreckage left by the two-year American effort to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"If things do not start to happen within two or three months, the people will 
start getting mad and disillusioned with democracy and the U.S.," Endara said. 
He said he believes that "in as soon as a year, they will see a very different 
situation than there is right now -- probably worse than Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Panama's economic problems, Endara said he is still trying to develop a 
policy that will purge the government of vestiges of the Dignity Battalions, 
paramilitary units that Noriega used to intimidate political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged political and security risks in creating a new military 
composed mostly of remnants of Noriega's 16,000-member Panama Defense Forces -- 
led by officers "who were not angels." 
</P>
<P>
But in an evident effort to play on American sensitivity about the prospect of 
a resurgent leftist movement that might jeopardize American influence over the 
Panama Canal, he stressed that the principal threat to his new government comes 
not from the old military but from the now-dormant left. 
</P>
<P>
"They would gain a lot of power and popularity if things don't start to 
happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The usually good-natured former lawyer was somber as he told his audience that 
"things are so bad, so explosive . . . that all that the United States has done 
-- its big effort, all our efforts -- will be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Although Endara acknowledged that his country has some responsibility for 
rebuilding its economy, his bleak warnings were aimed clearly at Washington. 
"This help has to come mostly from the United States," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a small but comfortable office in the Presidencia, a government 
building just renovated after its use as a barracks by American troops, Endara 
outlined a recovery package that included $40 million to rebuild El Chorrillo, 
a slum neighborhood severely damaged by the American attack, and a $200-million 
public works program to combat widespread unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Panama will need $700 million program in grants and loans 
channeled through private banks to businesses for the repair and restocking of 
stores victimized by the widespread looting and destruction that followed the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said he has not yet stressed his concern to the White House; his last 
conversation with Bush was Dec. 21, the day after the invasion. But he said 
that visiting U.S. congressmen have encouraged him to seek immediate action on 
the aid request, warning that "American memories are very short." 
</P>
<P>
He said they reminded him that some other world crisis will develop and "people 
will forget what is happening in Panama and what the needs of Panama are." 
</P>
<P>
Endara, first laughing and then turning serious when asked about the extent of 
American influence over his government, said, "I'm not a puppet of the United 
States, and I think the Panamanian people know that." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that other nations in the region have questioned the legitimacy 
of his U.S.-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with the people of Panama," he said. "I guess my 
problem is with the people of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
While repeating that "the United States has been very respectful of our 
independence," Endara went on to acknowledge that the very existence of his 
government is the result of the American invasion and occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Panamanian people have come to the conclusion that without U.S. help, we 
could never have gotten rid of Noriega," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Endara volunteered that he originally believed Panamanians could have 
"autonomously" ousted the dictator. But he said new indications of the extent 
of Noriega's power had persuaded him that "we could not have possibly gotten 
rid of Noriega alone." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success in toppling the head of the regime, Endara said government 
ministries remain infected by Dignity Battalion members still holding key 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably have not thrown everybody out," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Juan Chevalier, minister of commerce and industry, 
said his staff had confronted dozens of Dignity Battalion members after finding 
a computerized list showing his department riddled with more than 100 such 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
As the Noriega loyalists were called in, most would insist that "they did 
nothing," he said -- "until you present them with the photograph of the AK-47 
in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
He described scenes in which men who had once terrorized their colleagues 
pleaded tearfully in hopes of salvaging their reputations, if not their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had participated in the interrogations, Chevalier, who had been 
imprisoned by Noriega, replied: "By all means. You think I was going to miss 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Endara said he is satisfied that the process of rooting out the Dignity 
Battalion members is going well, although he expressed some concern about 
overzealous pursuit of suspected Noriega supporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said he knows of "two or three cases where injustice has been done" but 
added that the wrongs have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Endara defended his government's policy of creating a new 
Panamanian Public Force almost entirely from former officers and soldiers of 
the PDF. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government had denied the thousands of trained soldiers a 
place in the new military, "they would certainly have formed the backbone of a 
new armed resistance." 
</P>
<P>
All top-level PDF officers "have been thrown out" of the armed forces, he said. 
And, although the past records of those now given command are far from 
spotless, "we have to work with somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Although other senior government members have urged that the new security force 
be limited to about 3,500 men restricted largely to police work, Endara said in 
the interview that he expects its final size to reach about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
This force, although smaller than Noriega's PDF, would still include as many as 
four combat units of professional soldiers performing traditional military 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
The president expressed confidence that tight fiscal control could go far 
toward blocking any attempt by the new security force to reclaim the powers 
held by the PDF. He said he also plans to fragment its structure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to divide them," Endara said. He said he planned to establish 
separate units for immigration, criminal investigation and presidential 
security, duties previously kept under central military control. 
</P>
<P>
Endara also expressed confidence that another reputed hallmark of the Noriega 
regime -- the use of Panama by narcotics traffickers for money laundering -- 
will be eliminated by his government. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to play any role in narco-traffic or the laundering of 
narco-dollars," he said. But he indicated he sees no need to eliminate current 
bank regulations that permit accounts to remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he touched on the problems of the military and drugs, the president was 
clearly determined to send a message to the Bush Administration about the need 
for immediate economic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope that the United States will help us now get over the problems we 
have," he said in concluding the interview, "because if the United States 
doesn't help us, all our efforts will go down the drain."

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is unlikely to be hurt in the short run 
by the violent ethnic crisis in Azerbaijan, U.S. and British analysts said 
Tuesday. But Lithuania's threatened secession represents a serious threat to 
Gorbachev and his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Azerbaijan is not a danger to the system that Lithuania is," said Arnold 
Horelick, director of Soviet studies at the RAND Corp. "It might be if he is 
incapable of suppressing it, but he doesn't risk its spread, except perhaps to 
(other Muslim regions of) Central Asia." 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, by contrast, presents Gorbachev with two unpalatable courses of 
action, said Horelick, who was formerly the CIA's top Soviet analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"With Lithuania, use of force would end perestroika, end the current Soviet 
foreign policy," Horelick said. "But the precedent of Lithuanian secession 
would be picked up by the other Baltic states, Georgia, maybe others. It could 
lead to dissolution of the empire." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's enormous burdens, aggravated by both Azerbaijan and Lithuania, 
appear to be taking their toll on him personally as well as politically. A U.S. 
government official, who asked not to be further identified, presented the 
pessimistic view. 
</P>
<P>
"He is still in charge, still the man with the steel teeth," this official 
said. "But his long-term prospects, at this point, do not look very good. He is 
in the early phase of what we call the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has lost touch with his long-term strategy," the official continued. 
"He is now preoccupied with patching together reactions to day-to-day and 
hour-by-hour emergencies. He has lost the hard edge in controlling the pace and 
direction of perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
Most non-government as well as government experts are less gloomy. Many of them 
worry about the "emotional overload" reflected in reports of Gorbachev's 
ill-tempered outbursts at critical editors and legislators and even during 
man-in-the-street encounters. He has also threatened several times to quit. 
</P>
<P>
But given the enormous pressure he is under, most acknowledge that Gorbachev 
still shows what one expert called "remarkable composure." 
</P>
<P>
No reputable expert on Soviet affairs is predicting on the record that 
Gorbachev's days are numbered. "Not even within the intelligence community," 
one source said. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody Azerbaijani-Armenian fighting, latest in centuries of ethnic 
conflict over the same disputed territory, is rooted in both class and 
religious differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians in Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, tend to be middle-class merchants, 
entrepreneurs, employers," said Michigan University's Ronald G. Suny, an expert 
on Soviet Central Asia. "Azerbaijanis have been working-class, resenting them." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Armenians are Christian with a long cultural tradition. The Azerbaijanis 
are Shiite Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Giving the crisis international overtones, about 6 million Azerbaijanis live in 
Azerbaijan but another 9 million live in neighboring Iran. Some Azerbaijani 
demonstrators have called for independence, others for unification across the 
border, although the Iranian government has made no move to encourage 
secession. Nearby Turkey may also become a player, because the Azerbaijanis are 
a Turkish people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Age-Old Enmities 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians is not the only, but 
probably the worst, of the many age-old ethnic enmities among the more than 100 
peoples that make up the Soviet Union. If it is not controlled, experts 
consider other outbreaks likely elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Suny said Gorbachev's perestroika reforms were in danger of collapsing into 
chaos and anarchy until the Soviet leader ordered troops into Azerbaijan on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the point where Gorbachev had to show his iron teeth," Suny said. "He 
may have to discard the methods of perestroika to preserve the goals of 
perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
By sending the Soviet military to restore order, some analysts say, Gorbachev 
eroded a key pillar of his perestroika philosophy -- that economic, political 
and national differences can be resolved by peaceful, democratic means. Suny 
maintained that "after these events, it is no longer possible to argue that you 
can reform this multinational empire without violence." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts disagree. They argue that Gorbachev may actually win praise from 
Soviet conservatives in the short term for showing that he was willing to use 
force in Azerbaijan to maintain law and order, an issue of growing importance 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He must be careful, of course, that excessive force is not used," said a 
senior U.S. official. "But so far, I don't see the Azerbaijan situation 
worsening his political situation in Moscow very much." 
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, however, according to Princeton Sovietologist Stephen 
Cohen, the risk is that moderates will decide that perestroika is failing and 
refuse to support the next radical steps Gorbachev may be planning. He may then 
be forced to dilute his economic and political reforms still further. 
</P>
<P>
In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, in contrast to Azerbaijan, Gorbachev 
cannot use force to prevent secession without seriously damaging and perhaps 
killing his perestroika reforms, said Glasgow University's Alec Nove. 
</P>
<P>
Nove and other experts cite the vast differences between the Caucasus Mountains 
region, with their longstanding tribal feuds between ethnic groups, and the 
more Westernized Baltic states, where nonviolent political negotiations about 
sovereignty are now taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lithuania's secession, Nove said, would deal a major, perhaps fatal, blow 
to Gorbachev and his programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact on Gorbachev would be much greater than the territory is worth," 
added Stanford's Alexander Dallin. "There would be a search for scapegoats, for 
'Who lost the Baltics?' that would be like the 'Who lost China?' witch hunts a 
generation ago in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's success in coming party meetings, including a Central Committee 
session later this month, will be closely watched for signs that his power has 
weakened, Cohen added. Among other things, those meetings will consider the 
promised "divorce" legislation that will spell out how republics may legally 
leave the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
At its congress later this year, the Soviet Communist Party may even split in 
two, some experts have speculated, with the conservatives and nationalists 
separating from Gorbachev's radical reformers. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself presents the paradox of a leader who is losing control of 
events in his country even while his position within the ruling Politburo seems 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
On Gorbachev's three major fronts, RAND's Horelick said, he has failed to 
dampen secessionist sentiment in Lithuania, left the ethnic embers burning in 
Azerbaijan and backtracked on key economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you look, Gorbachev is not managing the forces at work, but another 
paradox is that the situation is so bad, it's hard to imagine someone else 
doing better," Horelick added. "There is no credible alternative to him, but 
even if there was, replacing Gorbachev might well make the situation worse, not 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow's Nove, however, sees a possible alternative -- Leningrad party boss 
Boris Gidaspov, a colorful scientist who initially supported reform but has 
since come out openly against some of Gorbachev's programs. But even Nove 
admitted that it is just a hunch. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts dismiss the view that a single alternative to Gorbachev is needed. 
If the conservatives decided to remove him, they could resort to a two-man or 
three-man leadership, much as the troika that initially followed Josef Stalin.

ARREST THWARTED A KILLING, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

An Indiana ex-convict, accused of leading two others in a cross-country murder 
spree that left at least four of his prison pen pals dead, planned to kill 
another correspondent -- a college professor he was staying with in Laguna 
Beach, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Eugene Goodman, 30, and two alleged accomplices from Goodman's hometown 
of Anderson, Ind., were arrested Sunday in connection with the slayings of 
three homosexual men in Mississippi and another in New York. All of the victims 
corresponded with Goodman while he was imprisoned in Indiana for burglary and 
sexual assault on an 80-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, Christopher Mead, 22, and Tracy Lynn Holland, 21, were seized in two 
separate SWAT-team raids after Orange County law enforcement agencies were 
alerted by authorities in the East that the suspects were believed headed to 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mississippi and New York murders, Tennessee authorities 
believe that they have strong evidence linking the suspects to the murder of a 
biology professor there in October. 
</P>
<P>
The slain men in Mississippi and New York were among an estimated 20 to 25 pen 
pals with whom Goodman corresponded while in prison in Indiana. Goodman and his 
accused accomplices, were staying in the South Laguna home of another pen pal, 
Carnegie-Mellon University professor Peter G. Jones, who is on sabbatical 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had not arrested Goodman," said San Clemente Police Sgt. Richard E. 
Downing, "I do believe the man (Jones) would have been the next victim." 
Downing added that Jones said he had been unaware of Goodman's alleged 
involvement in the murder spree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frightening," Jones said, in an interview at his two-story house 
tucked away in the hills of affluent South Laguna. "I see myself as very lucky 
because the police told me I was (the) next victim." 
</P>
<P>
As authorities from New York and Mississippi arrived in Orange County Tuesday 
to sort out the trio's alleged crimes and work out details of extradition, 
investigators began piecing together the extensive criminal record of Goodman, 
whom they described as the ringleader of the group. 
</P>
<P>
According to Indiana state parole records, Goodman was released from a state 
penitentiary on December, 1988, after serving 10 years of a 23-year sentence 
for burglary, sexual assault and other crimes committed during a break-in and 
an attack on an 80-year-old woman. It was during that time in prison that 
Goodman began writing to pen pals across the nation, many but not all of whom 
were homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodman was a con artist," said Itawamba County (Miss.) Sheriff's Deputy Terry 
Jones. "He operated through gay men. He would become their pen pal and he would 
try to get them to send him money and gifts. He was using them." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Investigator Richard J. Kadien of the New York State Police, who was in 
Orange County along with four colleagues seeking Goodman's extradition, said 
Goodman used a common inmate scam by seeking sympathy -- and subsequently, 
money -- from people who advertised for pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
"The story I heard was certainly that he had been very deprived," said college 
professor Jones, recalling his letters from Goodman. "He said the other night, 
in fact, that the only person who had ever loved him was his grandmother, and 
she died about a year ago. I don't even know if that was true. "

STATE IS WINNING MEDFLY WAR, AGRICULTURE CHIEF SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The state's top agriculture official, responding to concerns by some scientists 
that efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation from Southern 
California could fail, predicted Tuesday that the war against the pest will be 
won, and that it should be wrapped up by June. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is working," said Henry J. Voss, director of the state Department 
of Food and Agriculture. "We will probably find more flies, but I am confident 
we have the infestation under control and will complete eradication by the 
middle of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Voss' rosy prognosis followed by one week a report in The Times that several 
scientists are now concerned that the attempt to eradicate the crop-damaging 
pest with aerial applications of the pesticide malathion might not be workable. 
Some scientists pointed to a pattern of new infestations in the region in the 
last decade and suggested that the state begin contemplating how to coexist 
with the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, appearing Tuesday at a hearing of the state Senate's Agriculture and 
Water Resource Committee, said that since the start of repeated aerial 
malathion spraying in December, significantly fewer flies have been trapped in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
He said completion of a facility for breeding sterile Medflies in Hawaii also 
will help, providing as many as 500 million sterile flies a week by midyear. 
The so-called "steriles" are used to breed fertile Medflies out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're a long way from an infestation that we can't take care of," Voss 
said. "It's under control." 
</P>
<P>
Voss' prediction of victory came just as his department announced that a 
36-square-mile chunk of Orange County, covering Garden Grove and Westminster, 
will be sprayed with malathion Jan. 25 as a result of the discovery of a single 
fly in Garden Grove last week. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) said the disheartening discovery of 
new flies has left him skeptical that the Medfly war is going as well as Voss 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
"Something appears to be out of kilter," Ayala said to Voss and his aides. "Why 
are we not getting better results? I do believe they're doing the right thing 
now. But I don't believe it is fully under control. If it was, why would we be 
finding all these flies now?" 
</P>
<P>
Voss conceded that the department made a serious error last July at the start 
of the infestation by underestimating its size. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala said that, while he believes the aerial pesticide spraying is safe, 
politically there is no way it can go on with no end. 
</P>
<P>
"At what stage do you declare it is out of control?" Ayala asked. "With all due 
respect, we cannot continue spraying malathion . . . forever." 
</P>
<P>
Ayala's statements echoed the concern of several scientists who said last week 
that they believe the Medfly may now be permanently settled in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have an established population -- and I would say the evidence in 
L.A. is that it is pretty well established -- it (eradication) is very 
unlikely," one of the scientists, Daniel Simberloff, a professor of biological 
science at Florida State University, said. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala said he is willing to give Voss the benefit of the doubt for now. 
</P>
<P>
"By June or July, if they don't have the infestation under control, they're 
going to have to admit that spraying hasn't done the job," he said. "If we're 
going to continue spraying and spraying and spraying past June, they'd better 
look for a better answer." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted 5 to 1 Tuesday to ask 
county and state officials to stop malathion spraying until effects of exposure 
on children and youths can be studied. 
</P>
<P>
The halt was proposed by board President Jackie Goldberg, who said her 
constituents are "in absolute panic" over the spraying. Board member Roberta 
Weintraub voted no, saying she needed more information before she would oppose 
a program that could ruin California's agriculture.

SUPREME COURT ACCEPTS CHILD SEX ABUSE CASES; 
</P>
<P>
MOLESTATION: A RULING COULD NEGATE STATE STATUTES THAT ALLOW YOUNG VICTIMS TO 
BE SHIELDED DURING PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court said Tuesday it would decide whether defendants in child 
molestation cases have an absolute right to confront their young accusers in 
open court. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling on the issue, expected by July, is likely to have a profound impact on 
the growing number of child sex abuse prosecutions across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the McMartin Preschool child molestation case exploded in a glare of 
publicity in 1983, most states have rushed to enact laws to shield young 
victims from the trauma of confronting their alleged molesters in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five states, including California, now permit child victims in sensitive 
cases to testify by closed-circuit television and not in the presence of the 
accused. In addition, 27 states permit the use of videotaped testimony, and 22 
permit doctors or child care workers to testify on behalf of a child. 
</P>
<P>
But two years ago, in a surprising opinion, the Supreme Court suggested that 
the laws could be unconstitutional because they infringe on the Sixth 
Amendment's guarantee that a criminal defendant "shall enjoy the right . . . to 
be confronted with the witnesses against him." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2 ruling threw out the sexual assault conviction of an Iowa man because 
the two 13-year-old victims were shielded from his view behind a screen when 
they testified. 
</P>
<P>
The court opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia said the Sixth Amendment gives 
defendants an absolute right to a "face-to-face confrontation" with their 
accusers in court. 
</P>
<P>
But only four justices signed the full opinion, and two in the majority -- 
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Byron R. White -- said they believed the 
confrontation right was "not absolute." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, courts in several states, including Maryland, Idaho, 
Massachusetts, West Virginia and Tennessee, have relied on Scalia's opinion to 
overturn convictions of child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at the urging of prosecutors in 28 states, the justices say they will try 
again to clarify the reach of the Sixth Amendment and its impact on child 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and child care specialists say that already traumatized child 
victims must be protected from abusive adults who may have threatened them with 
death if they break their silence. But defense lawyers say they fear that 
innocent people could be convicted as a result of a young child's exaggerated 
memories or suggestive questioning from an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia voiced the latter fear in his controversial 1988 opinion. "That 
face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or 
abused child; but by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, 
or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult," he wrote in Coy vs. Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Two cases will be heard by the court in April. One concerns the closed-circuit 
TV testimony used against a Maryland preschool owner convicted of sexually 
abusing four children. A trial judge concluded the children would suffer 
"serious emotional distress" if forced to face a woman who had threatened them 
if they talked. All four had shown evidence of physical injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a Maryland appeals court threw out the conviction of Sandra Craig 
because her right to confront her accusers had been violated. Prosecutors 
appealed, and the high court agreed to hear the case of Maryland vs. Craig, 
89-478. 
</P>
<P>
The second case concerns the testimony of an Idaho pediatrician who examined 
and interviewed a 2 1/2-year-old victim of sex abuse by her parents. The doctor 
found the little girl had been injured and told the jury that she said "daddy" 
caused the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
While the testimony normally might have been rejected as "hearsay," states such 
as Idaho have permitted doctors and child care specialists who work with very 
young, abused children to testify on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Idaho Supreme Court threw out the parents' convictions because it 
concluded the doctor's testimony was unreliable and violated their right to 
confront their accusers. The justices agreed to hear the state's appeal in 
Idaho vs. Wright, 89-260. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, even though the McMartin case spurred passage of the child 
protective laws now being challenged, the Supreme Court's decisions in these 
cases may have little impact in California or on the McMartin case itself. All 
the child witnesses in the nearly three-year McMartin trial have testified in 
open court. 
</P>
<P>
The California Legislature has enacted only one, rarely used law designed to 
give special protection to child victims, said Karen Ziskind, a deputy attorney 
general in Sacramento. A 1985 statute allows closed-circuit TV testimony in 
child abuse cases but limits its use only to instances where it is "clear" that 
the child faces grave danger from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts an onerous burden on the child and the prosecution, so it's not been 
used much," Ziskind said. Other measures have been defeated in part because of 
fears that they would be unconstitutional, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the Supreme Court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ordered a school principal to stand trial for failing to prevent two high 
school girls from being sexually molested by a teacher. The principal and his 
assistant contended that they are immune from a federal damage suit filed by 
the two former students, but an appeals court in Philadelphia said the two 
officials knew about the teacher's behavior and failed to take action to stop 
it. On Tuesday, the justices refused the principal's plea for immunity. (Smith 
vs. Stoneking, 89-780.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether environmentalists can block the Interior 
Department's move to open up 180 million acres of public lands in the West to 
mining and development. The case began when former Interior Secretary James G. 
Watt in 1981 sought to remove the development restrictions on huge tracts of 
Western lands. The National Wildlife Federation, citing complaints from several 
members, won a court injunction blocking the government effort in 1985. Now, 
however, the high court will hear the Interior Department's contention that the 
environmentalists were not personally injured and therefore had no standing in 
court to get an injunction against the government. (Lujan vs. National Wildlife 
Federation, 89-640.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heard arguments on whether California state attorneys can challenge the 
merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains. Because of lax antitrust 
enforcement by the federal government, state officials must have the authority 
to block "mega-mergers" that could harm competition and consumers, state Deputy 
Atty. Gen. H. Chester Horn Jr. told the court. But lawyers for the supermarket 
chain said that under the 1914 Clayton Act, only the federal government has the 
power to contest such a merger. A ruling in California vs. American Stores, 
89-258, can be expected in several months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand a $60,000 city fine against a Chicago cable company that failed 
to carry enough local TV programming. In a closely watched appeal, the Chicago 
cable franchise contended that the First Amendment does not permit the 
government to regulate what is broadcast. But without comment, the justices 
dismissed the appeal. (Chicago Cable Communications vs. Chicago Cable 
Commission, 89-747.)

COLONEL ORDERED JESUIT MURDERS, CRISTIANI SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
EL SALVADOR: THE PRESIDENT CITES TESTIMONY FROM SOLDIERS WHO ALLEGEDLY TOOK 
PART. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Alfredo Cristiani on Tuesday said that junior officers arrested in 
the slaying of six Jesuit priests have told investigators their colonel 
specifically ordered them to commit the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides, head of El Salvador's military academy, has 
denied the charges against him, Cristiani said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"But the testimony of the lieutenants is that they received a direct order from 
him to go and shoot the priests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first public suggestion that orders for the killings had been 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani announced last week that Benavides, three lieutenants and four 
soldiers had been detained in connection with the assassinations. Benavides was 
commander of the zone where the murders took place, and the soldiers were based 
at his academy that night. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the case was turned over to a civilian judge, who has 72 hours to 
decide if there is enough evidence to continue holding the men and proceed to 
trial. The eight suspects appeared briefly at the judge's chambers in the 
afternoon but refused to comment to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Benavides, who arrived in full military uniform, is the first high-ranking 
officer ever accused of a political murder by the government. Military and 
paramilitary "death squads" have been blamed for thousands of civilian deaths 
during the country's 10-year civil war, but the tightly knit military has been 
virtually immune from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said he is optimistic that this case will be brought to trial 
"because of the amount of proof" against the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The priests, along with their cook and her 15-year-old daughter, were 
assassinated at their residence at the Central American University on Nov. 16, 
five days after leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front launched a massive urban offensive. The university is near the military 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani admitted that the arrest of Benavides has created tension within the 
armed forces but said he does not consider that a threat to his seven-month-old 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"Tensions now don't mean what they did in the 1970s and early 1980s. I don't 
fear a coup," Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Benavides is a member of the powerful tandona, the military academy class that 
controls most of the important military commands in the country. Col. Rene 
Emilio Ponce, armed forces chief of staff, is a member of that class, but 
Cristiani insisted that he and the rest of the high command backed the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the military are concerned that the case will fuel the guerrillas' 
strategy of trying to divide the army. In their latest peace proposal, the 
rebels called for the removal of members of the tandona. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, army commanders received anonymous packets in the mail containing an 
article on corruption in the military and a report by captains and majors 
criticizing the high command's management of the war and alleged corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In the hourlong interview, Cristiani said that a lieutenant and a second 
lieutenant from the Atlacatl Battalion reported receiving the order from 
Benavides. Another lieutenant based at the Gen. Gerardo Barrios Military School 
said he was simply told by Benavides to "accompany them on the mission," 
Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Salvadoran law, the testimony of an indicted suspect is not admissible 
against another defendant. Sources close to the case say other soldiers who 
allegedly participated in the action have been detained but will not be charged 
so that they may serve as witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said those arrested participated in a Nov. 13 search of the 
university and the priests' residence, which he said he had authorized. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I would not have liked it, but they (the military) said, 'Look, 
we're being fired on.' I did say, 'Well, go ahead,' " Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the case said that Benavides may have been pursuing 
intelligence reports that guerrillas or members of the leftist Salvadoran 
National Workers Union were meeting on the campus. No such meeting was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the case said the Nov. 13 search of the campus and 
Jesuit residence appears in the army high command's records of military 
operations but that no action on the campus was recorded on Nov. 16, when the 
killings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said the army was listed as a possible suspect from the beginning of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting anything to come up. We jotted down different possible 
motives. Obviously, elements from the armed forces were under duress, and with 
the tensions of war, sometimes people get things on their mind that are not 
rational," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers are skeptical that the military had intended to take the blame 
all the way to Benavides. The colonel's name did not surface until another 
Salvadoran colonel leaked the information to a U.S. military adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. adviser, a major, held the information for nearly two weeks before 
passing it on to his superior. Col. Ponce, the armed forces chief, reportedly 
was stunned when U.S. officials confronted him with the suspicions about 
Benavides. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Carlos Armando Aviles, who fingered Benavides, had been detained, but 
Cristiani said he is no longer confined to quarters. But he confirmed that 
Aviles will not be sent as military attache to Washington, as he had been 
ordered before the controversy began. 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers suggest it is unlikely that Benavides would have acted 
alone to order what clearly would be an internationally repudiated political 
crime. They also question whether other mid-level officers -- majors and 
captains -- were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said the investigation has been straightforward and that it will 
continue. He said the armed forces willingly pursued the investigation and that 
he did not have to negotiate with the military for it to proceed.

DOLE STIRS FUROR WITH CALL TO CUT ISRAEL AID, DIVERT IT

Signaling a potential change in congressional sentiment, staunch pro-Israel 
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called Tuesday for shifting at least $330 million in 
U.S. foreign aid from Israel and four other key recipients to Panama, Latin 
America's drug-fighting countries and Eastern Europe's "new democracies." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Republican leader's proposal in a New York Times opinion page 
article drew "a massive reaction from all over the world," not the least from 
infuriated supporters of Israel, said Dole's press secretary, Walt Riker. 
</P>
<P>
Dole noted that Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and Pakistan receive 
more than two-thirds of the $9.9 billion in U.S. foreign aid earmarked for 
specific countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it make sense, at this historic moment, to provide these countries 
practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing dramatically promising 
new aid initiatives in Eastern Europe or other important countries?" the 
senator asked. "What about, for example, those Latin American nations in the 
front lines in the war against drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that a 5% cut in current aid programs to "the big five" would provide 
about $330 million -- what he said would be "enough to respond to the needs of 
new democracies such as Poland, Hungary, Panama and countless needy countries 
that under current allocations will receive not one penny of American aid." 
</P>
<P>
He said that an even larger across-the-board cut and reallocation might be 
warranted "as the democratic revolution gains momentum." At a news conference, 
he suggested that the cut could be as much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that President Bush has the authority to reallocate up to $300 
million in foreign aid, even from funds earmarked for Israel and other 
countries, without congressional approval. But he is not permitted to shift 
more than $50 million to any one recipient. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration supports 
the current level of aid for the five top recipients but also would like to 
have more flexibility to redistribute funds. 
</P>
<P>
"That support (of Israel and the four others) has been longstanding and has 
been a part of Administration efforts," Fitzwater said. "That doesn't mean we 
wouldn't like to have some money for other countries and other problems, but we 
just don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said Bush told him at a White House meeting that he had read the article 
and "appreciated it. . . . I assume that he must have agreed with it." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler wouldn't go that far, saying 
only that Dole's proposal was "something that the Administration thinks is well 
worth looking at . . . in light of, let's take a for instance, the unbelievable 
changes that have gone on in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who represents one of the nation's 
largest Jewish constituencies, said that cutting aid to such countries as 
Israel and Egypt would "encourage the most irresponsible elements in such 
countries as Libya, Iran and Syria." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman and Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who also attacked the Dole plan, 
called for shifting money from the defense budget to pay for any increased aid 
to Eastern Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than cutting funds to five of our closest allies, let's find more money 
for democracy in costly, unnecessary weapons programs like SDI (the Strategic 
Defense Initiative), the B-2 bomber and the mobile MX missile," Metzenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the so-called Israeli lobby has long exerted enormous clout on Capitol 
Hill, an assistant to a prominent Democratic supporter of Israel commended 
Dole's "courage" and said it represents growing sentiment in Congress to spread 
available funds more widely. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an acute awareness among those involved in foreign aid that we've got 
50 people (countries) trying to get into the bathtub, but we've got a 400-pound 
gorilla (Israel) sitting there in the middle," said the aide, who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is not only about Israel," which receives $3 billion, he continued. 
"There's a lot in there for Egypt ($2.1 billion). The Philippines program ($360 
million) is more realistic, but the amounts for Turkey ($610 million) and 
Pakistan ($490 million) are out of control."

BRITON HOPES U.S. STOPS OPPOSING FORCED RETURN OF 'BOAT PEOPLE'

British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Tuesday that Britain hopes the Bush 
Administration will soon drop its opposition to forced repatriation of "boat 
people" to Vietnam and that he can see no option but to continue with the 
controversial deportations. 
</P>
<P>
Senior British officials have been dropping hints here since the start of 
Hurd's visit that Washington is prepared to reverse its longstanding opposition 
to sending boat people back to Vietnam after they fail to quality as political 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
They said the United States seeks a delay in a Geneva meeting of the U.N. 
standing committee on Vietnamese refugees, originally scheduled for Thursday, 
to allow time to formulate a new policy on deportations. 
</P>
<P>
The British believe the Administration is now publicly prepared to accept the 
principle of deportations, provided that the British give a voluntary return 
program more time to work. 
</P>
<P>
International acceptance of the mandatory repatriation program would allow it 
to be carried out under the monitoring and payment of the Office of the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The mandatory return program began in December, when Hong Kong sent home 51 
people who had failed to qualify as political refugees in the three-tier 
screening used since June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"No date has been fixed for future planeloads," Hurd told a news conference 
Tuesday at the end of a four-day visit. "But I don't see anything on the 
immediate horizon that would enable us to alter that policy . . . because I 
don't see at the moment another way of making it clear that moving from Vietnam 
to Hong Kong is not a road to resettlement in the West." 
</P>
<P>
Hurd spent the morning touring two centers for boat people. Residents of one, 
at Hei Ling Chau, organized a noisy but peaceful demonstration to show their 
opposition to forced repatriation.

GEN. POWELL BACKS EAST BLOC ON NEW DEFENSIVE STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: TOP U.S. OFFICER REASSURES WARSAW PACT THAT NATO WILL NOT LAUNCH 
OFFENSIVE OPERATION. 
</P>

<P>
America's senior military officer Tuesday endorsed the East Bloc's move toward 
a more defensive military posture and reassured his Warsaw Pact counterparts 
that the United States and its NATO allies will not launch an offensive 
military operation against Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Vienna, Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, cited "initial evidence" that the Warsaw Pact is restructuring its 
forces in line with new defensive military doctrines in the wake of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the encouraging signs, the West's key concern remains "the specter of 
confronting greatly superior forces armed, trained and suited for offensive 
ground operations," Powell said in prepared remarks at a Vienna session of 
defense chiefs representing 35 nations from both the East and the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout Eastern Europe we see the dramatic movement toward political 
pluralism," Powell said. "For the United States, as for any democracy, glasnost 
-- public discussions and debates over military strategy and programs -- is as 
important as perestroika. For through real glasnost, national security and 
military policies will no longer be the purview of the few but the 
responsibility of the many." 
</P>
<P>
Powell's remarks appeared to be directed primarily at the chiefs of Eastern 
Europe's military organizations, whose future roles in the Warsaw Pact are 
uncertain as a result of the the major domestic upheavals that have swept their 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Powell also met Tuesday for the first time with the Soviet chief of staff, Gen. 
Mikhail Moiseyev, an encounter that officials said would allow Powell to raise 
further questions about the Soviets' efforts to restructure their military 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military intelligence officials have complained that while the Soviets say 
they are reshaping their forces for defensive operations, they continue to 
deploy large supplies of spare weapons parts and huge ammunition caches near 
the East-West border, where they could be used by troops in an offensive 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
If the forces had genuinely renounced offensive operations, the analysts said, 
the supply and ammunition sites would be withdrawn from the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna meeting came as the East European nations, several of which sent new 
defense chiefs to represent them, are debating the roles of their militaries at 
home and in potential joint military actions with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those countries, including Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have 
moved to impose extraordinary new restrictions on the use of their troops 
outside their national territories -- gestures that Powell appeared to applaud. 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting the postwar origin of the Atlantic Alliance with that of the Warsaw 
Pact, Powell said that in Eastern Europe, "the instruments of war were replaced 
by the instruments of coercion. Throughout the capitals of Eastern Europe, the 
liberated became the occupied." 
</P>
<P>
Powell delivered his remarks on the first day of an unprecedented "military 
doctrine seminar" organized by a 35-nation forum that negotiates limitations on 
the military operations and practices of its member countries, most of which 
are European nations. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the seminar's task "is to help shape a new order in Europe," Powell 
defended U.S. military initiatives that have introduced to Europe new, 
long-range weapons designed to attack Soviet forces sent in to reinforce the 
first wave of a Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This NATO commitment to preserve territorial integrity at every potential 
point of attack . . . explains the NATO strategy of bringing force to bear on 
successive echelons of attacking forces," Powell said, noting that NATO would 
be overwhelmed quickly if it had to face the full brunt of the Warsaw Pact's 
tank armies. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances, however, does this imply the alliance's intent to 
invade and seize territory," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
He also echoed suggestions by other U.S. officials that American ground forces 
will shrink significantly in response to changed military threats in Europe, 
while the U.S. Navy is expected to remain large.

The country's 10 state-run oil refineries were expected to grind to a halt 
within 24 hours as union workers went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Oil unions called the strike in support of a claim for a 64.8% pay raise to 
make up for inflation. The state-run oil company, Petrobras, offered 21.47%. 
The strike is likely to disrupt gasoline exports to the United States. Brazil 
is America's second-biggest foreign gasoline supplier.

The plane crashed about 4,500 feet up 7,450-foot Pico Blanco Mountain, 10 miles

Monday morning from the capital's airport. The State Department identified 
three of the Americans as David Ulland of Austin, Minn.; Lester Ross of 
Lancaster, Pa., and Norman Baltimore of East Smithfield, Pa. It said the

BANK PLEADS GUILTY TO HANDLING DRUG PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
NORIEGA: A LUXEMBORG INSTITUTION LINKED TO PANAMA'S OUSTED STRONGMAN FORFEITS 
$15 MILLION IN ASSETS TO THE U.S.

<P>
An international bank that handled accounts for ousted Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega pleaded guilty Tuesday to laundering millions of dollars of 
cocaine profits and agreed to forfeit more than $15 million in assets to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department hailed the 11th-hour agreement by the Luxembourg-based 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International as "the largest cash forfeiture ever" 
and said the bank has pledged to cooperate with federal investigations of money 
laundering worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But the settlement was denounced by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) as "a sad 
commentary on a country that is supposed to be taking money laundering 
extremely seriously." Kerry heads a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that 
found evidence that the bank had helped Noriega shelter $10 million after his 
indictment in Florida on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
"When banks engage knowingly in the laundering of money, they should be shut 
down," Kerry said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Dist. Judge W. Terrell Hodges, in Tampa, Fla., accepted guilty pleas from 
two divisions of the bank but did not formally impose sentence. After the plea, 
the trial of six former officers of the bank and two Colombians began on 
charges of helping launder $32 million in cocaine proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoids Issue 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman, David Runkel, sidestepped a 
question on whether the guilty plea and the bank's cooperation would strengthen 
the government's drug-trafficking, money-laundering and racketeering case in 
Miami against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Noriega has been known to use this bank in the past," Runkel said. 
"Whether there is any connection to the Miami case, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all charges, the bank would have faced up to $40 million in 
fines. Under the agreement, the bank faces substantial penalties if it fails to 
cooperate, and it must implement strict guidelines to block money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Links to Noriega are expected to be detailed during the trial by Stephen 
Michael Kalish, a convicted marijuana dealer who is serving a 15-year prison 
sentence. Kalish already has testified in other proceedings that he gave 
Noriega an attache case stuffed with $300,000 in bills to arrange banking 
connections on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Before pleading guilty, lawyers for the bank had threatened to expose Noriega's 
links with U.S. intelligence agencies if he were brought into the case. 
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1973 by Pakistani bankers and Arab investors, the 
privately held bank has grown to about 400 offices worldwide and $20 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged that the bank's offices were part of an international 
network that laundered millions of dollars for Colombian and other drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Kerry's subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics began 
probing the bank as part of a lengthy inquiry in 1987 and 1988 into cocaine 
trafficking and money laundering in Central America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators accumulated evidence of strong ties between Noriega and the 
bank, including a secret, $25-million account maintained by the general there. 
But Jack A. Blum, chief counsel of the Senate subcommittee, said the full 
extent of the Noriega connection was never discovered because the inquiry was 
delayed at the request of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear this bank had been the bank to which Noriega had referred drug 
traffickers," Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was chief of intelligence for the Panamanian military when he opened 
the account, and he had sole authority over it, according to testimony before 
the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
He used the account to pay cash to Panamanian politicians and to finance 
extensive travel and lavish spending in the United States and Europe by himself 
and his family, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Amjad Awan, a former executive of the bank and a defendant in the Tampa trial, 
told Senate investigators that he was Noriega's personal banker from 1982 until 
early 1988. Noriega ordered the account closed after he was indicted on drug 
charges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handwritten Drafts 
</P>
<P>
Awan, a 42-year-old Pakistani national, said Noriega opened the account with a 
deposit of several hundred thousand dollars in cash and that later deposits of 
cash and checks pushed the balance as high as $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Awan claimed that he did not know the origin of the funds. He said he often 
dispensed cash from the account to Panamanian politicians who came to the bank 
with handwritten notes from Noriega authorizing the withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
After he left Panama in 1984 for Miami and later Washington, Awan said he still 
acted as Noriega's banker and flew frequently to Panama and New York for 
meetings with the general. 
</P>
<P>
One federal charge accused the bank of helping launder several million dollars 
for Kalish, starting with a $2-million deposit by Kalish at the bank's Panama 
City branch in 1983. Prosecutors say the transaction was handled by Awan. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by Blum about the deposit during his sworn statement, Awan said he 
had no recollection of it.

TIME BEGINS TO RUN OUT FOR KILLER'S LEGAL APPEALS OF DEATH SENTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: AUTHORITIES SAY HIS CHANCE OF WINNING A REPRIEVE ARE SLIM. 
AFTER 11 YEARS OF LEGAL MANEUVERING, HIS IS THE MOST ADVANCED DEATH PENALTY 
CASE IN THE STATE.

<P>
The arduous bid by Robert Alton Harris to escape the executioner has lasted 
nearly 11 years, one of the longest series of appeals since California 
reinstated capital punishment in 1977. His pleas now have been rejected four 
times by both the U.S. and California supreme courts. 
</P>
<P>
But while his legal battle is still not over, time is clearly running out for 
the 37-year-old convicted killer, whose case is the most advanced, 
procedurally, of those of the 273 inmates on San Quentin's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Legal authorities say Harris' chance of winning a reprieve are slim. At this 
late stage of the process, experts say, the courts ordinarily will not 
intercede to block an execution unless there is important new evidence or a 
change in the law that could affect a case. 
</P>
<P>
"Issue after issue after issue has been decided against Harris and one expects 
that the likelihood is not great that a court will intervene now," UC Berkeley 
law professor Phillip E. Johnson said. "There comes a time when a case must be 
decided and a penalty imposed. . . . Judges are well aware that it breeds 
public cynicism to keep cases going on forever." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Tuesday's action by the federal high court, Harris' lawyers had 
filed a separate attack on his death sentence before the state Supreme Court. 
Harris has admitted the slayings of which he was accused, and his conviction 
itself is not at issue. 
</P>
<P>
If the state high court turns down Harris' latest plea for life, his lawyers 
can continue the fight right up to the time of execution with emergency appeals 
to federal district and appeals courts and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court. 
His execution date -- to be set by a state trial court in San Diego -- would 
remain in effect unless some court issued a stay. 
</P>
<P>
His last hope would rest with a petition for clemency from Gov. George 
Deukmejian. However, few legal observers expect a reprieve for Harris from the 
governor, a supporter of the death penalty. And, because Harris is a 
twice-convicted felon, an act of clemency would also need approval from the 
state Supreme Court, as provided in the state Constitution.

Harris contends now in his appeal to the state Supreme Court that his 11-year 
incarceration on Death Row violates the constitutional prohibition against 
cruel and unusual punishment. He argues, as a result, that he is entitled to a 
new penalty trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, his lawyers, Charles M. Sevilla and 
Michael J. McCabe of San Diego, say the delay was not his fault. The long legal 
journey is attributable to the "exceedingly poor draftsmanship" of the state 
death-penalty law, the complex constitutional questions involved, overcrowded 
court dockets and the time required by judges to thoroughly consider what are 
literally matters of life or death, the attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
"If the state and federal justice systems cannot conclude that a conviction 
and/or penalty is properly obtained within a decade, then something is wrong," 
Sevilla and McCabe say. 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors have not yet been asked by the court to respond to this 
latest Harris appeal. But officials say there is nothing significantly new in 
his current appeal. And on the issue of delay, the state can argue that Harris 
has not been harmed but indeed has benefited from the years his case has been 
in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that somebody who has been trying to delay the process (with 
appeals) is complaining that it's taking too long to execute him," state Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Louis R. Hanoian says. "If the people of the State of California had 
had their druthers, he would have died back in 1983 or thereabouts." 
</P>
<P>
Harris is also raising other claims, saying he is entitled either to a new 
penalty trial or outright reduction of his sentence to life in prison. Among 
other things, Harris' lawyers argue that: 
</P>
<P>
* A psychologist, called as a witness for the prosecution to support its 
request for the death penalty, wrongly testified that Harris was a sociopath 
who was incapable of feeling remorse and could never be rehabilitated. Since 
then, the accepted scientific definition of sociopathy has changed, rendering 
the psychologist's assessment invalid. And Harris has made a change for the 
better, becoming a model prisoner who is liked and respected by other inmates 
and even some prison guards, the petition says. 
</P>
<P>
* Newly discovered evidence shows that Harris had been adversely affected by 
several mental disorders -- post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit 
disorder, organic brain damage and fetal alcohol effect. Harris suffered 
"shocking and unconscionable" physical and psychological abuse as a child from 
"horribly abusive, alcoholic parents," the petition says. His childhood would 
score a "9.0 on a Richter scale for traumatic stress." Such evidence should 
have been presented to a jury as mitigating factors supporting a sentence of 
life in prison rather than death, the petition contends. 
</P>
<P>
* Harris should have another chance to show that he was the victim of 
discrimination because of his sex. While scores of men have been sentenced to 
death in California since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1977, only 
one woman has been sentenced to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat surprisingly, Harris' case moved relatively fast at its early stages 
before the state Supreme Court, which, under then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird, had been widely criticized for its reluctance to uphold capital 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was convicted and sentenced to death in March, 1979. Less than two years 
later -- in February, 1981 -- the state Supreme Court, in its mandatory review 
of the case, upheld the capital verdict against Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Further appeals to both the federal and state high courts were rejected. But in 
1982, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco blocked Harris' 
execution, ruling that capital sentences must be reviewed to make sure they are 
not disproportionate to punishments imposed in other, similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that ruling, saying such 
"proportionality" review was not required by the U.S. Constitution. Harris went 
back to the lower courts to pursue other issues. 
</P>
<P>
It then took five years for the federal appeals court in San Francisco to 
reject Harris' arguments, sending the appeal back once again to the high court 
in Washington to be turned down Tuesday.

BROWN'S CONCERN ON GAS TAX SPLIT EASES

<TEXT>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian and other legislative 
leaders, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said his concern that a gasoline tax 
proposal would be unfair to Northern Californians has been resolved. The San 
Francisco Democrat said Northern Californian will still get 33% to 37% of the 
gas tax revenue, or just a few percentage points less than the 40% it has been 
getting. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said a Metropolitan Transportation Commission report that Northern 
California could get as little as 27% is inaccurate, because it does not take 
into account related factors -- such as forgiveness of past overpayments to the 
north. The bipartisan proposal would raise the gas tax by 9 cents a gallon and 
would raise the state's constitutional spending limit. If voters approve the 
proposal in June, it would raise an estimated $18.5 billion over 10 years.

A strong earthquake struck along the North Coast, but there were no immediate 
reports of injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude-5.3 temblor was centered about 50 miles south of Eureka, 
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. The state Office of 
Emergency Services reported that residents in the town of Petrolia said items 
were knocked off shelves, but that there was no other damage. Petrolia is near 
a land formation known as Punta Gorda, almost directly at the point where the 
San Andreas Fault comes ashore.

AND NOW ART POPS UP ON THE BILLBOARDS; 
</P>
<P>
URBAN SCENE: A FIRM THAT LOBBIED AGAINST SIGNBOARD CURBS IS A CO-SPONSOR OF THE 
EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High above an Encino mini-mall loomed the strangest billboard on Ventura 
Boulevard, a sign that featured two icons of mass appeal: Mao Tse-tung and 
Colonel Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Down below, Westec Security guards Scott Rice and Jim Miller stood beside their 
patrol cars, waiting for crime to strike. Why, Rice wondered, did the colonel 
have a red circle and a slash across his face? Seemed an odd way to sell fried 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get it," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's trying to say something," Miller ventured, "that nobody's going 
to understand." Later, Miller noted Warholian influences in the billboard. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever artist May Sun's intent, her mammoth canvas is getting an 
extraordinary audience. Every day for the past month, thousands of motorists 
have driven past the original artwork that is 48 feet wide and 14 feet high. If 
it gives them pause, if it makes them think, that's all the artist asks. 
</P>
<P>
In a metropolis of drive-by shootings and drive-through everything, Sun and her 
patrons call this "drive-by art." Not unlike Mao and Colonel Sanders, Sun and 
her patrons are trying to reach the masses. 
</P>
<P>
Sun's work is one of three such billboard originals now on exhibit amid the 
cluttered, crassly commercialized urbanscape of Los Angeles. All are scheduled 
to be moved this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chairman and the Colonel" will go from its Ventura Boulevard and Woodley 
Avenue location to 1st and Main streets downtown. Another that features a 
crawling Abraham Lincoln and some oblique political commentary ("Don't Hate Me 
Because I'm Beautiful") will go from Hollywood Boulevard at Cherokee Avenue to 
the Hollywood Freeway at Highland. The third, an apolitical paean titled 
"Remember Your First Love?" will go from Lincoln Boulevard and 83rd Street in 
Westchester to Sherman Way and Lindley Avenue in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of the time art is separated from the public -- in museums, galleries. 
You have to go there. This is bringing it to the public. . . . The idea is to 
expand what art can mean to people," said Jinger Heffner, spokeswoman for Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), which co-sponsored the program with 
Patrick Media, the nation's largest billboard advertising firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's advertising promoting artists, and artists promoting the advertising 
medium," said Lynn Eberhard, a Patrick Media art director. "It works both 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Media derives public relations benefits in the program -- and the 
billboard industry can use it. Critics see Patrick Media, which owns 7,000 
signboards in Southern California, as a culprit in the battle against billboard 
blight. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Dato, director of public affairs for the company, lobbied against a 1988 
city measure proposed by Councilman Marvin Braude that would have prohibited 
the construction of new billboards. The measure failed on an 8-7 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this (art billboard program) would ever change Marvin Braude. 
But I think it has influence with people interested in promoting art in L.A.," 
Dato said. 
</P>
<P>
The current show represents the second year of collaboration between LACE and 
Patrick Media. In a previous public art program run by Patrick Media in Texas, 
the company simply reproduced on a large scale a small selection of existing 
artworks. In Los Angeles, LACE organized a competition seeking entries 
expressly created for the outdoor medium. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of artists and officials selected the winners from about 200 entries. 
The billboard company paid winners $750 and provided their own staff artists to 
produce the billboards. The works will be on display for four months, 
periodically shifting locations. 
</P>
<P>
The medium provides special problems for the artist, said Daniel Martinez. A 
judge in the current competition, Martinez was a winner the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, artists must reach a public that is inured to a bombardment of 
commercial images. Getting their attention is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"People drive by and they get a latent image. Maybe they'll catch a glimpse of 
something in the corner of their eye and they'll think, 'What was that?' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's billboard was a rousing personal success. Titled "Don't Bite the 
Hand That Feeds You," it featured two ferocious-looking dogs poised around a 
small human hand ladling tomato sauce onto a plate of meat loaf. The title, 
Martinez said, was ironic: "To me it means maybe sometimes you should bite the 
hand that feeds you." 
</P>
<P>
A French curator took note and included Martinez's billboard in a touring show 
that features Latino artists of Los Angeles. Most recently, Martinez's 
billboard was displayed outside an art museum in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Two winners -- Sun's "The Chairman and the Colonel" and "Don't Hate Me Because 
I'm Beautiful," by Victor Henderson and Elizabeth Garrison -- borrow overtly 
from the advertising medium. Whereas Sun uses the image of Colonel Sanders, 
Henderson and Garrison borrow the text of a shampoo advertisement that features 
a model of striking pulchritude. Sun, who was born in Shanghai, grew up in Hong 
Kong and moved to California as a teen-ager, said her work reflects more her 
"searching and questioning" than her opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The original inspiration, she said, was a newspaper article describing the 
opening of the first American fast-food emporium in China -- a Kentucky Fried 
Chicken outlet in Tian An Men Square directly opposite Mao's mausoleum. Student 
protesters had taken over the square when she finished her original concept. 
Like the finished product, it featured Mao in reverse black-and-white tones, 
like a photographic negative. But there was no slash across the colonel's face. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to title it 'Democracy: It's Finger-Lickin' Good,"' Sun recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But after Chinese troops killed more than 700 protesters, the work "seemed too 
flippant," Sun said. "So I put the banned sign across the colonel's face and 
tried to make Mao look more sinister." Look closely and you see Mao giving the 
colonel a suspicious glance. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Garrison say their depiction of an apologetic Abraham Lincoln on 
all fours is meant to have many levels of interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said that, for him, it represents a vain America in decline, 
apologizing for its position in the world. But Garrison said she "even heard a 
fascist interpretation -- that America has been on its knees for too long." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Remember Your First Love?" makes no attempt at ambiguity. Artist 
Tomata DuPlenty said he wants to reach the heart more than the mind. 
</P>
<P>
On his giant canvas are four images laid out like a comic strip. From the left, 
the first is a farm boy holding a lamb, then a grandmother knitting, then a 
teen-age girl slow-dancing with her boyfriend, then a sailor sipping a beer. 
(The sailor, DuPlenty explained, is dreaming about adventure.) Across the top 
is the word "Remember" and across the bottom is "Your First Love?" 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty hokey, huh?" DuPlenty said with a laugh. Born with a name he declined 
to reveal, DuPlenty used to be the lead singer in the punk rock band The 
Screamers. He admits to having mellowed, to becoming "a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
"People have enough seriousness in their lives today. The whole idea of it," 
DuPlenty said of his billboard, "is to just let people give themselves a 
break."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: FLY ME TO THE MOON -- FOR A NOSTALGIC LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Elections come and go, but junkets are forever. 
</P>
<P>
Image-wise, these have not been good times for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his 
Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Those pictures of mass weddings of Moonies in South Korea are a trifle spooky. 
That 13-month federal prison sentence Moon served for tax evasion was a nasty 
bit of business. And, late last year, bishops of the United Methodist Church in 
South Korea complained that Moon's international conferences are nothing but 
Christian-bashing sessions. 
</P>
<P>
One group, however, is dedicated to repairing Moon's tattered persona in the 
United States: the Washington-based American Freedom Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's president is the Rev. Robert Grant, founder of the Christian 
Voice political action committee. Its director is Richard Ichord, former 
Republican congressman (1960-81) from Missouri and the last chairman of the 
now-defunct House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Grant wrote in the Washington Post that the coalition has received $5.2 million 
from "business interests of the Unification Church" since it was founded in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Grant took to the op-ed page to answer allegations by a former employee that 
the coalition is nothing but a front group to help Moon spread his cultish 
ministry. Nonsense, Grant said. The coalition is interested solely in 
"promoting traditional American values." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the coalition is organizing a junket to South Korea for a dozen 
or more former members of Congress and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the weeklong trip is to attend one of Moon's international 
conferences. Departure is Jan. 30; expenses are being paid by the AFC and the 
Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in the traveling party: former San Diego County Congressmen Lionel 
Van Deerlin and Bob Wilson and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a fellow Republican who served with Ichord on the Armed Services 
Committee, is also a board member of American Freedom Coalition, a paid 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson represented San Diego from 1952 to 1980 and is now a Washington lobbyist 
and director of Air/Space America in San Diego. He did not respond to repeated 
phone calls over three days. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deerlin, a Democrat who represented the South Bay from 1962 to 1980, said 
he views the trip merely as a free way to visit places he hasn't seen in 
decades, including Panmunjon, where American troops are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, if Ichord and the coalition are looking for someone to influence 
public opinion in favor of Moon, "I'm not much of a catch." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around the block a few times, you know," Van Deerlin said. "You 
don't grow up in politics in San Diego County without being able to defend 
yourself in all company. I don't think I'm going to be wooed and won over by 
anything I see or hear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They're Playing His Song 
</P>
<P>
Something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
* The space shuttle Columbia retrieved 12.5 million tomato seeds that had been 
in an orbiting satellite for six years, to test the effects of weightlessness 
and cosmic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds will be distributed to students around the country, who will report 
back to NASA on how the plants fare, as part of SEEDS (Space-Exposed Experiment 
Developed for Students). 
</P>
<P>
While hauling in the satellite, the astronauts played the theme song from 
"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," the cult classic by Steve Peace, movie maker 
and assemblyman from Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
* It could be hot today when a San Diego City Council committee considers the 
proposed Human Dignity Ordinance to ban discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Expect strong support from gay leaders and equally strong opposition from the 
religious right and Young Americans for Freedom. Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. 
Maher also opposes the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of council members like the proposal: Bernhardt, Filner, Hartley, 
Pratt and Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and O'Connor oppose it as an unneeded duplication of existing civil 
rights laws; McCarty and Roberts are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
If it passes, Christian groups are vowing a referendum to repeal it.

STATE MAY DECERTIFY 'CREATIONIST' SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TROMBLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
A state Board of Education evaluation team has recommended that state approval 
be removed from a school in San Diego County that is the only "creation 
science" school in the country offering master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The team's report recommends stripping the mantle of state legitimacy from the 
Institute for Creation Research in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
The report "seems reasonable to me," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig said Tuesday, although he will not act on the recommendation for a month 
or so. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of the state license might mean the end for the institute, which has 
provided some of the ideological underpinning for the literal, fundamentalist 
biblical interpretation of the creation of the Earth and life on it. 
</P>
<P>
John Morris, administrative vice president of the institute, said the report is 
part of "a very insidious plot" on Honig's part to "establish a state religion 
in California" that would be "anti-creationist" in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he had received no word of the evaluation team's report, but added 
that "obviously we'll appeal if the ruling goes against us." 
</P>
<P>
The institute has been authorized to grant master's degrees in biology, 
geology, physics and science education since 1981, but has awarded only about 
20 degrees in that time, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Honig has been trying to drop state approval because he 
thinks the school teaches religion, not science. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation report, written by a team of five college and university 
scientists who visited the institute for several days last August, touches only 
lightly on that controversy, but does find that the institute's offerings are 
not comparable to other higher-education institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's curriculum "is not consistent in quality with curricula offered 
by appropriate established accredited institutions," the report says, and its 
courses "are not comparable to the courses required of graduates" of accredited 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The report says the faculty has produced little reputable research, the library 
and laboratories are inadequate and the courses do not prepare students to be 
science teachers, which is one of the institute's main goals. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the negative findings, and the recommendation that state approval be 
lifted, were unanimous on the part of the five-member team, which included two 
science faculty members from UCLA, one from UC San Diego, one from California 
State University, Long Beach and one from Cedarville College in Cedarville, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But the report states that Leroy E. Eimers, professor of physics and 
mathematics at Cedarville, disagreed with some of the findings and recommended 
that state approval be continued for the master's programs in geology, physics 
and science education but not in biology. Eimers was named to the evaluation 
group at the suggestion of the Institute for Creation Research. 
</P>
<P>
This is Honig's second encounter with the forces of "creation science" in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In November, after a dispute that lasted several months, the Board of Education 
adopted curriculum guidelines for science textbooks that stress the teaching of 
evolution as theory but delete references to evolution as scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute with the Institute for Creation Research began when the school 
applied for renewal of its state license in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Non-accredited higher-education institutions must have state approval in order 
to offer degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Honig did not think an institution that taught its students that mountain 
ranges could be created in a day and that Earth might be only 6,000 years old, 
instead of about 4.5 billion years as most scientists believe, was very 
educational. 
</P>
<P>
However, those judgments are made by teams of experts, not by Honig's office. 
Evaluators visited the Santee campus in the summer of 1988 and later wrote a 
report recommending that state approval be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee vote was 3 to 2, and one of its members switched his vote, 
Department of Education sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After lengthy discussions among lawyers for both sides, it was determined that 
the institute would make some curriculum changes and a new review would be 
conducted in the summer of 1989. This is the negative report that was made 
public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The institute can appeal to a state administrative law judge, who would 
recommend that Honig either accept or reject the evaluation report. 
</P>
<P>
The institute also can, and probably will, seek to overturn the decision in 
court.

MAN TOSSES ACID, DIES IN FIGHT WITH PSYCHIATRIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An elderly Los Angeles man armed with a gun and ropes threw hydrochloric acid 
on a Santa Monica psychiatrist at his office Tuesday, badly burning him, then 
died minutes later during a struggle with the doctor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the bizarre incident as a tragic end to a long and bitter feud 
over the psychiatric treatment of the man's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the unnamed dead man, 74, was married to a woman being treated by 
the psychiatrist, Dr. George Michael Seeds. Seeds, 60, of Marina del Rey had 
been threatened by the family and was also sued by them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were uncertain, hours later, whether Seeds had killed the man, or 
whether the man had suffered heart failure or other seizure after he forced his 
way into Seeds' office and attacked the psychiatrist. An autopsy was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Detective Shane Talbot said the dead man's family had sent 
threatening letters to Seeds over an unknown period of time in connection with 
their lawsuit over his treatment of the wife -- a dispute that appeared to have 
been resolved when Seeds reached a settlement with the family and the 
threatening letters stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release Seeds' assailant's name, pending notification of next of 
kin. However, court records show that Arthur W. and Mildred Waters of Pacific 
Palisades filed a lawsuit against the psychiatrist in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors at Waters' apartment complex on Sunset Boulevard said police 
detectives questioned them Tuesday about Waters and his wife. A law enforcement 
source who asked to remain anonymous later confirmed that Waters was the dead 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Seeds had ceased treating the woman identified as Waters' 
wife one to two years ago and the family was not heard from again -- until the 
attacker appeared Tuesday in Seeds' office about lunchtime, dressed in a sport 
coat and tie and wielding a loaded gun, ropes and a container of acid. 
</P>
<P>
The man forced his way into an inner office at Seeds' 12th-floor psychiatry 
practice at 1260 15th St., threatened Seeds with a loaded .25-caliber pistol, 
pushed him to the floor and then tried to "tie him with ropes," Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Seeds felt "something burning on his back and buttocks," so he 
attacked the man and managed to bring him down, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
As Seeds fought back, at some point he "noticed that the man was no longer 
breathing." He called 911 about 12:25 p.m. and waited for police, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns and was being transferred 
from Santa Monica Medical Center to Torrance Memorial Hospital's burn center, 
said hospital spokesman Ted Braun. 
</P>
<P>
In telephone interviews, two of Waters' neighbors told a bizarre tale of a man 
"obsessed" with avenging what -- in his mind -- was the mistreatment of his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime neighbor, Madeline McKenna, said Waters spent much of his time going 
from public agency to agency trying to report Seeds. He spoke freely about the 
alleged mistreatment his wife received and became "obsessed" with reporting 
him, McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so upset that no one would listen to him," McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Gayle Lockwood, said that Waters had been threatening to harm 
the doctor for some time and that she had notified Los Angeles police of his 
threats, but they said there was nothing they could do. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, McKenna said Waters had become more agitated, vowing "to find 
some way to get those doctors" and saying "he had to do what he had to do. I'm 
not going to kill anyone. I'm just going to hurt them," Waters said, according 
to McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Mildred Waters had a history of treatment for mental illness, 
and they said Arthur Waters told them that she shot herself to death last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Waters left the apartment where he had lived for 11 years and 
where he was manager until recently, telling McKenna and Lockwood he was going 
to check into a motel at the beach in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to expose this," McKenna said he told her. "Nobody will listen to me. 
I've got to do something." 
</P>
<P>
The women described Waters as an otherwise gentle, helpful man. 
</P>
<P>
"The hurt must have bottled up inside of him," McKenna said. "He just couldn't 
get over the fact she would end up this way and nobody would listen." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wally Ghurabi, head of emergency services at the Santa Monica hospital, 
said Seeds suffered the worst burns on his forehead, neck and left buttocks. 
Ghurabi said there was also evidence of rope burns around Seeds' ankles. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third attack upon a mental health practitioner in the past year in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Robbyn Panitch, a mental health worker, was stabbed 31 times and 
killed by a patient. A social worker was stabbed and badly hurt last April at a 
board-and-care facility for mental patients in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of thing that everyone is always afraid of happening," Los 
Angeles psychiatrist Anthony Rosenthal said of the attack on Seeds, whom he has 
known since 1969. "There are all sorts of incidents where people threaten . . . 
but the number of times when violence occurs is quite small. The prediction of 
violence is something at which psychiatry is weak." 
</P>
<P>
One police spokesman said Seeds admitted that he was responsible for the man's 
death. However, Sgt. John Miehle, said police "are not looking at this 
criminally at this time and we are still sorting this out. The doctor is able 
to speak; however he is injured so we decided not to press the issue." 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note on Seeds' office door said only: "Dr. Seeds will not be 
available to see patients for the remainder of the day." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Southern California Psychiatry Society, where Seeds is a 
member and has been active on the Government Affairs Committee, Seeds graduated 
from USC Medical School in 1955. He completed his psychiatric training in 1972 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and completed a fellowship at UCLA in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Stokkie, a spokesman for USC, said Seeds was affiliated with USC's 
teaching school from 1978 to 1988, where he was a clinical assistant professor. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds was also listed as a member of the American Medical Assn. and the Los 
Angeles County Medical Assn. 
</P>

Oliver and James Rainey contributed to this story.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $1 MILLION IN SEIZED DRUG ASSETS GIVEN TO 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million check derived from assets seized from drug dealers was presented 
Tuesday by Assemblyman Richard Katz to school officials to fund 14 elementary 
and junior high school gang and drug intervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot programs will be financed by the state Gang Risk Intervention Pilot 
Program created by legislation authored last year by Katz (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the GRIPP program precedent-setting is the source for funding -- 
the GRIPP program is 100% funded with the seized illegal assets of drug 
dealers," said Katz, who handed the check to county Office of Education 
officials at a ceremony at Audubon Junior High School in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The program was the brainchild of George McKenna, who as principal of 
Washington Prepatory High School, received national attention for successfully 
implementing a similar program at his own school.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR'S ILLNESS DELAYS MCMARTIN 
DELIBERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror fell ill Tuesday while deliberating the last 13 counts in the marathon 
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, as the panel's talks bogged down on 
questions about a conspiracy charge. It was uncertain whether the juror would 
be well enough to deliberate today. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, considering 65 molestation and conspiracy charges against Raymond 
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were still trying 
Tuesday to resolve the issue of whether they could convict one defendant of 
conspiracy and acquit the other. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders told them that they could; 
they then asked how to go about it. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders, who discussed the issue at length with attorneys for both sides and 
asked for case citations, said he would answer the question when jurors return 
to resume deliberations.

BILL BOYARSKY: TRUMP SINGS WORDS FROM AN OLD SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday, I drove to the Ambassador to see Donald Trump and hear his plans to 
put up the world's tallest building on the site of the old hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is part of my memory lane. As a young Associated Press reporter based 
in Sacramento, I stayed there for weeks in 1966, covering Ronald Reagan's first 
campaign for governor. Even then, the Ambassador was beginning to fall apart. 
But for someone who wasn't sure how to order from room service, it seemed 
pretty grand. 
</P>
<P>
One bad June night two years later, I was sent to the Ambassador from the AP 
office downtown. As my cab sped west on Wilshire, toward the hotel, I saw an 
ambulance heading east. "Follow that ambulance," I said to the cab driver. We 
ended up at the old Central Receiving Hospital in time to see Robert F. Kennedy 
being carried inside. 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador wasn't the place for sentiment or memories last Saturday. In 
place of the courtly doormen, security people looked suspiciously at visitors. 
The hard-nose approach was suitable. Sentiment is a handicap in dealing with 
Donald Trump and in considering the impact that his proposed development would 
have on the city. 
</P>
<P>
If Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council are not careful, Trump will bluff 
them into humble submission, just as Al Davis is doing. Like the Raiders' Al, 
Trump knows the way to our leaders' insecure hearts: A sweet song with lyrics 
including the words "world class." 
</P>
<P>
For the Trump affair is really an exercise in business negotiation. Behind the 
hype about the building is the old story of a developer trying to make money 
from a plot of land. The question is whether the city will let him have what he 
wants or obtain a deal that will benefit the taxpayers as well as Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Trump is a Manhattan real estate developer and Atlantic City casino and hotel 
owner whose flair for hype, self-promotion and huge projects made him one of 
the 1980s' most famous entrepreneurs. He basks in his fame. After buying the 
Eastern Airlines shuttle, changing the name to the Trump Shuttle and seeing its 
business increase, he said, "The name made that successful instantaneously." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's Los Angeles game was clear even before he arrived: Come in with an 
outrageous proposal, watch the neighbors go crazy and then propose a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Trump doesn't look like a tough negotiator. He has a soft, friendly face and 
wore a conservative blue suit and red tie, part of a wardrobe tasteful enough 
to have won the Tailors' Council of America's award for best-dressed 
entrepreneur in the country. He's not Raider Al, who has slicked back hair and 
wears Raider black and white. When you meet Al, you know he's trouble. With 
Trump, there's no warning. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to build a "world class" combination of apartments, condos, 
offices, a hotel, retail stores and a ballroom twice as large as the 
substantial one at the Century Plaza. That will please political candidates, 
who will be able to invite twice as many donors to their fund-raising dinners. 
</P>
<P>
The outrageous part was the world's tallest building. Although Bradley and 
Councilman Nate Holden, who represents the district, shared the press 
conference table with Trump, neither liked the proposal. Another skeptic in 
attendance was Council President John Ferraro, whose district adjoins the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
That means the bargaining is beginning. Even though there is no height limit in 
that area, Bradley and the council, through various statutes, have complete 
control over the building site. Let's assume Trump doesn't really expect to be 
allowed to put up a building more than 125 stories tall, and will give up the 
idea. The municipal side should insist on more concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The city should have power over design. Bradley, Ferraro and Holden should 
demand that the development be livable, the kind of place where you can walk 
around, shop, browse, meet in small places for drinks, meals or coffee. We need 
friendly, human scale. World's biggest doesn't mean world class. 
</P>
<P>
Second, and just as important, the city should exact a stiff price from Trump 
and his partners. The school district wants to build a badly needed high school 
at the Ambassador site, but the 25 acres on Wilshire Boulevard are better 
suited for commercial development. Trump and his partners should pay a big 
amount of money toward a high school nearby, and help finance low-cost housing 
to replace homes torn down for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolic of the ambivalent nature of the Trump deal was the press conference 
site, the old Ambassador bar where Mrs. Robinson had a drink with Benjamin in 
the movie "The Graduate" before taking him upstairs for the lesson of his life. 
Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's affair didn't go well. Maybe the Trump affair will 
end more happily for Los Angeles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL OIL, EX-MANAGER CLEARED IN BLAST CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil and a former refinery executive were found innocent of criminal 
charges Tuesday that they obstructed a Torrance Fire Department investigation 
into a July 15, 1988, explosion that killed one man and injured two others. 
</P>
<P>
After Jesse Rodrigues, an assistant Torrance prosecutor, presented the city's 
case -- and without hearing any Mobil witnesses -- South Coast Municipal Judge 
Josh Fredricks decided that the city had not proved its case and entered a 
verdict of not guilty for Mobil and the now-retired executive, Thomas Gregory. 
In 1988, he was the second-ranking manager at the Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the way this thing went," said Mobil spokesman Jim 
Carbonetti.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTONOVICH ACTS TO CUT RUSH-HOUR TRUCK 
TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to cut worsening street traffic and air quality in the Los Angeles 
area, County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Tuesday proposed a series of 
measures aimed at getting large trucks off the road at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich proposed banning truck deliveries to all 1,900 county government 
sites and ordering the county's own fleet of 400 trucks off the road during 
peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's motion also asked for a study of the worst traffic intersections 
in the unincorporated areas of the county where the Board of Supervisors has 
jurisdiction and proposed a possible ban on all rush-hour truck traffic at 
those sites. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal follows similar plans by the City of Los Angeles.

EARLY BIRD LAYS HOPE FOR BIG CONDOR BROOD; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: THE EARLIEST EGG ON RECORD PLUS MORE POTENTIAL BREEDING PAIRS 
RAISE HOPES FOR A DOZEN CHICKS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The laying of a California condor egg early in the breeding season, combined 
with four new pairs of potential condor mates, has San Diego Wild Animal Park 
officials hoping that as many as a dozen eggs may be hatched in Southern 
California this year, three times the number in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The egg was laid in captivity at 1:20 p.m. Monday, taken from the nest several 
hours later, quickly examined by a zookeeper and placed in an incubator. The 
examination under intense white light, called "candling," allowed the keeper to 
examine both the shell and the interior of the egg. 
</P>
<P>
"The egg looked good," said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
The egg will remain in an incubator until Thursday or Friday, when keepers will 
determine whether or not it is fertile, also through candling. The egg will 
incubate for about 56 days, and the zoo expects it to hatch near March 12. The 
chick would then be placed with the captive flock, where it would remain if not 
transferred to the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The same pair of condors produced a female chick named Towasinah last year, so 
breeders at the Wild Animal Park are confident that this egg is fertile, 
Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
The egg is the earliest breeding of a California condor since record-keeping 
began in the mid-1800s, and it comes five weeks earlier in the year than the 
first egg of 1989, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four new pairs of California condors have reached maturity this year, bringing 
the total of potential breeding pairs to 11, and park officials hope that as 
many as 12 healthy chicks in Los Angeles and San Diego will be hatched this 
year, contrasted with four last year. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the potential breeding pairs are in San Diego, six in Los Angeles. A 
total of 32 California condors exist, all in captivity and equally divided 
between the two zoos. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials said they have no explanation for the early laying this year. 
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, such early breedings have occurred in the past and they 
just haven't been recorded," Hanscom said. The earliest recorded breeding 
occurred in early February, 1907. 
</P>
<P>
The early start, however, does not necessarily assure a longer season, Hanscom 
said, adding, "For all we know, it may end early as well." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Kiff of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in Los Angeles said 
it is possible that weather is the predominant factor in determining the length 
of the breeding season, citing a condor pair that lost interest in mating last 
year when a heat wave set in. 
</P>
<P>
Kiff said the condor that laid this egg, AC 8, is particularly active at 
mating. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a particularly good female. She really cranks out the eggs," Kiff 
said. "She's a lover." 
</P>
<P>
The animal park hopes the early mating season will translate into two, possibly 
three eggs from AC 8 and AC 5. (AC stands for adult condor.) 
</P>
<P>
The new egg is the latest in a breeding program that hopes to reintroduce the 
condor to the wild by 1992, Hanscom said.

REDISTRICTING PANEL APPOINTED AFTER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday appointed an advisory committee to help 
redraw council district boundaries, but not before choices for the politically 
sensitive posts sparked more arguing between the council's chief antagonists, 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Filner's claims that O'Connor had chosen his political enemies for 
positions on the board, this round in the political grudge match went to the 
mayor. With only Filner and Councilman Bruce Henderson dissenting, the council 
approved O'Connor's recommendations for the 17-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
The council was required to appoint a racially, ethnically and geographically 
diverse advisory committee as part of its September settlement of a 
voting-rights lawsuit by the Chicano Federation, a legal action that sought to 
enhance the political power of Latinos and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But the final decision on the extremely sensitive issue of redrawing council 
districts to reflect population changes remains in the hands of the council, a 
task that must be completed by Oct. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the legal settlement, the council also agreed to place a measure on 
the June ballot asking voters whether the council should be expanded from eight 
seats to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Filner, who opposed the settlement, has maintained that it is an attempt to add 
Latinos to his district to oust him from office in 1991. Filner, an Anglo 
representing a district with a sizable Latino population, defeated Latino 
attorney Mike Aguirre to win election in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Filner questioned the number of panelists, O'Connor's right to 
select the nine at-large members, and her choice of two members he said are 
political enemies of his. The other eight panel members were nominated by the 
eight council members. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said he has "concerns about the numbers and concerns about some of the 
individuals. We have to have a discussion about that, and then, if there are 
concerns, we can go to the court." U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades has 
retained jurisdiction over the case. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Filner opposed the selection of attorney Patricia Meyer, 
Aguirre's law partner and the lawyer who continues to represent the Chicano 
Federation in the lawsuit, and longtime political consultant Dan Greenblatt, 
who ran former Councilwoman Gloria McColl's victorious 1983 campaign over 
Filner. Meyer was an at-large choice, and Greenblatt was nominated by 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw on this list the person who chaired the campaign against you (and) 
the law partner of the person who ran against you . . . . I think you would 
have a different reaction to the committee," Filner told Councilman Ron 
Roberts, who supported O'Connor's selections. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also was aided by Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who said the council had 
"tacitly" agreed in closed session to allow the mayor to largely shape the 
committee, and by senior Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack Katz, who said that a 
federal magistrate had approved Meyer's participation on the committee. Chicano 
Federation Chairman Jess Haro also voiced approval.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLY LAWSUIT! ADAM WEST TAKES ON AD 
AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Batman, television actor Adam West was accustomed to battling such villains 
as the Penguin and the Joker. But in Burbank Superior Court on Tuesday, West 
took on a more substantial foe -- a group of advertising agencies he alleges 
stole his characterization. 
</P>
<P>
West, who portrayed the caped crusader in the campy 1960s television series, is 
seeking $900,000 in damages from the agencies for producing a television 
commercial featuring another actor as Batman. West, 51, testified that the 
actor used gestures, mannerisms and speech patterns similar to ones he used in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
The suit names three agencies -- Ian Leech &amp; Associates of Los Angeles, 
Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson of Boston, and BBDO New York. Anthony Liebig, an 
attorney for the agencies, said they purchased the rights to portray Batman 
from DC Comics, which originated the character. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors perform roles, they don't own them," Liebig said. "If you want to do a 
commercial using Robin Hood, do you have to go deal with the estate of Errol 
Flynn?"

HIDDEN HILLS POLL FINDS MOST OPPOSE HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than two-thirds of Hidden Hills residents who responded to an advisory 
poll oppose plans to build low-cost housing for senior citizens on the edge of 
the exclusive community, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the town's mayor, who earlier had hoped the poll would vindicate the 
council's support for the low-cost housing plan, said a low turnout weakened 
the poll's authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically failed to get the sense of the community," Mayor Chris K. Van 
Peski said. Only 410 of the 1,100 registered voters eligible to participate 
took part in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The poll asked four questions, including whether the council should move ahead 
with its plan to build lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
To that key question, 282 residents said no, and 125 said yes. 
</P>
<P>
Two other questions sought opinions on annexation and continued use of a 
redevelopment agency, both of which are related to the affordable housing plan. 
To annexation, 297 were opposed and 107 in favor. Continuance of the 
redevelopment agency was opposed 279 to 127. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to meet tonight to discuss the non-binding poll. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan supported by the City Council, a developer would build a 46-unit 
project for senior citizens on part of 25 acres the city would annex from Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
On 20 acres, the developer would build nine luxury homes within the gated 
community that would be accessible by its private roads. The remaining five 
acres -- outside the gates and roads -- would include the senior housing 
project and commercial office space. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would allow the city to settle a lawsuit by Los Angeles County and a 
private attorney over its use of a redevelopment agency to fund a flood-control 
project. The suit cited state law that requires 20% of redevelopment funds to 
be spent on affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Concerned Citizens Committee, which is opposed to the 
lower-cost housing plan, said the poll clearly indicated that most Hidden Hills 
residents want the council to reject the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is obvious. . . . I don't think people want this community to 
change," said Susan Porcaro, who, along with two other committee members, has 
taken out papers to run in the April 10 council election. Incumbents Van Peski, 
Colleen Hartman and Warren H. McCament also have taken out papers. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said she had considered declining to seek reelection but will run again 
because of the affordable housing dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to read it," Hartman said of the poll. Opponents were more 
likely to respond to the poll, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't gotten what we hoped for, which was a decisive yes or a 
decisive no," Hartman said. "You just don't have enough people voting."

STORM IS EXPECTED TODAY; ANOTHER WAITS IN WINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a monthlong dry spell, San Diego is quickly making up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
A vigorous winter storm moving in from the Gulf of Alaska could dump as much as 
an inch of rain on San Diego today and tomorrow, and up to a foot of snow in 
the mountains, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm is expected to weaken tonight and dissipate by Thursday afternoon, 
but another storm in the Pacific is waiting in the wings, forecaster Wilbur 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received 3.42 inches of rain for the season (which runs from July 
through June), but, if we get a half an inch today and Thursday, we'll be close 
to the normal 4.18 inches," he said. More than an inch of rain has fallen since 
the first storm moved in Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the rain, "we may have thunderstorms, and we cannot rule out funnel 
clouds and waterspouts," he said. A cold front coming into a low-pressure area 
can produce funnel clouds. 
</P>
<P>
So much rainfall in a short period can lead to problems. Saturated ground and 
hillsides could cause street flooding and mudslides, especially in construction 
areas, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures are expected to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a very cold storm," Shigehara said. "We have issued a snow 
advisory for the mountain areas." 
</P>
<P>
Snow mixed with rain could fall as low as the 1,500-foot level, making travel 
hazardous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except in the desert, temperatures throughout the county are not expected to 
rise above 58 today, and will dip into the 30s tonight, according to forecasts.

LAPD ORDERED TO REHIRE OFFICER FIRED IN SEX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in two years, a Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered the 
reinstatement of a veteran Los Angeles police lieutenant who was fired for 
failing to respond fully during a departmental investigation of alleged sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Ronald Williams, 47, formerly assigned to the vice squad at the Police 
Department's 77th Division in South Los Angeles, said that given his two-year 
battle to get his job back, he won't celebrate until he gets his first 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased," the 22-year police veteran said of the decision by Superior 
Court Judge David P. Yaffe. "My only apprehension would be if the city develops 
other tactics to continue to deny me my job." 
</P>
<P>
LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said Tuesday that Chief Daryl F. Gates was 
disappointed and "amazed" by the judge's ruling for Williams, who has been 
convicted by three police Board of Rights tribunals in connection with the 
departmental inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding whether to appeal Tuesday's ruling, Booth said, "We will take a 
close look at all of our legal options. And whatever is done will be legal." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department maintains that Williams effectively retired from the 
force when he began drawing benefits from the police force pension fund. 
Williams and his attorney, Laurence B. Labovitz, contend that he made it clear 
all along that he was drawing from the pension fund while he was pursuing legal 
efforts to win back his job. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaffe agreed Tuesday that the City Charter does preclude officers above 
the rank of sergeant from returning to active duty after retirement except by 
invitation of the chief of police. But he said Williams made "a mistake" in 
believing he could accept the pension benefits and still return to active duty 
if he prevailed in the disciplinary case. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaffe further ruled that it was the city's responsibility to have better 
advised Williams of his rights. He ordered Williams reinstated with back pay, 
to be offset by the amount paid in pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Labovitz estimated that his client would be entitled to between $40,000 and 
$60,000, after the pension payments have been deducted. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. A. David Hotchkiss, who represents the city and the LAPD in 
the case, criticized the ruling, saying it is "a little bit like someone going 
through divorce proceedings, then claiming spousal rights after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who joined the LAPD in 1967 and, according to his attorney, is one of 
only about 15 black lieutenants in a department of 8,000, initially was 
suspended from the force in July, 1987. Gates recommended on Aug. 4, 1987, that 
he be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Labovitz, who has repeatedly claimed that Williams is being discriminated 
against because he is black, said he plans next month to file suit in federal 
court, claiming that the Police Department -- and Chief Gates personally -- has 
violated the officer's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' suspension followed an internal investigation of allegations that he 
had shown sexually explicit videotapes to two teen-age girls several years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Because the misconduct complaints were made after a one-year statute of 
limitations had elapsed, he could only be disciplined on the charges of failing 
to respond adequately during the internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1987, a departmental Board of Rights agreed that the termination 
was justified. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, a Superior Court judge ruled that the punishment of firing was 
too severe and ordered Williams reinstated. A state appeals court affirmed that 
ruling, but a second board of rights hearing concluded again that Williams 
should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Williams -- who said Tuesday, "I would like to go back to the same division, to 
the same job" -- has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
But Hotchkiss said Tuesday that "to prove Lt. Williams had made false 
statements (to investigators), we had to prove that the (alleged sexual) 
misconduct occurred. And we did that." 
</P>
<P>
Booth said Tuesday the only reason a third Board of Rights panel decided in 
December, 1989, to give Williams a 30-day suspension, rather than fire him, was 
because the officer had "voluntarily retired." 
</P>
<P>
"Bear in mind, the findings of guilty were still there," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Labovitz said that if Gates continues to block the officer's return, he will 
ask the court to punish the police chief with a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good officer. He has served the city of Los Angeles well. He 
deserves to be reinstated to his job. . . . Lt. Williams looks forward to many 
long years of active duty with the LAPD."

EDISON, DEVELOPER TO BUILD DESALINATION PLANT ON CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Edison and a condominium developer Tuesday announced plans 
to build a system to convert seawater to drinking water on Santa Catalina 
Island. It would be one of the first desalination plants on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Cove Associates, the developer, will build the facility in exchange 
for about 24 million gallons a year from the plant. The agreement will clear 
the way for a condominium complex Hamilton Cove is building on the water-poor 
island. 
</P>
<P>
Edison will own and run the plant and will use its half of the water produced 
as a reserve against drought. Some water will also be made available for other 
construction projects, according to Keith Lefever, Edison's Catalina district 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Though not widely known, the United States is second only to the Middle East in 
the number of operating desalination plants, according to Neil D. Berlant, 
managing partner of Water Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be an increasing amount of desal activity in Southern 
California," Berlant predicted. Dramatically rising prices for drinking water 
have only in recent years begun to make seawater desalination economical in 
certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The project awaits approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Edison has already applied for state and local permits to run a desalination 
plant.

TRUSTEES TO RETHINK DEMISE OF READING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of an experimental remedial reading program for seventh-graders in 
San Diego city schools will be discussed once again by the district board of 
trustees after it learned Tuesday that many educators disagree with a negative 
evaluation on which the board relied to kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
A Times article Tuesday detailed the objections raised by teachers and 
principals at the four schools that piloted the special one-semester program to 
a report issued by the district's evaluation department. 
</P>
<P>
The educators believe the 3-year-old program both improved skills and boosted 
the desire to read among low-achieving seventh-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Although the schools did not receive copies of the report until Tuesday -- 
after the newspaper article noted that its contents had not been given to 
principals or teachers -- they strongly criticized it after learning of the 
contents from a reporter -- for its methodology and several statements of fact 
concerning the training of teachers and the nature of books and materials used, 
as well as for its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Jim Roache, supported by colleagues Kay Davis and Ann Armstrong, asked 
Supt. Tom Payzant to bring the program back before the board in two weeks so 
issues raised by the piloting schools can be fully discussed. Armstrong asked 
also to have the teachers from the schools participate in the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said that, although he would not vote to continue the program based on 
teachers saying that "they believe" it works, he wants to take a second look at 
it because several points raised about the evaluation involve whether all 
aspects of the pilot were fully explored. 
</P>
<P>
Several teachers raised questions about whether the evaluation fairly measured 
changes in attitudes among low-achieving seventh-graders, whether it fairly 
compared students who took the course to those who did not in terms of reading 
performance, and whether any shortcomings are attributable more to the limited 
nature of the remedial class rather than to flaws in teaching or materials.

DONOVAN PRISON BUSINESSES IN THE RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State-run businesses employing inmates at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional 
Facility on Otay Mesa lost nearly $1.4 million last year, one of the largest 
deficits in the statewide prison work program, a recently released audit shows. 
</P>
<P>
But officials for the Prison Industries Authority, which runs the jobs program 
for inmates, blamed the losses on one-time start-up costs and predicted the 
businesses would show a profit for the current fiscal year ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not unusual for a business to lose money the first year or so," said 
Richard Lowry, the authority's assistant general manager for administration and 
marketing. "You have the learning curve of the inmates, and some of them need 
more training than others." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the prison industries system lost $276,156 for the fiscal year ending 
last June 30, according to an independent audit by Deloitte &amp; Touche 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 deficit would have been much worse, however, if not for an unexpected 
rebate of nearly $4 million from the public employees retirement system -- 
money returned to authority civilian employees whose pension deductions had 
been excessive over several years. Without that windfall, losses would have 
been more than $4.27 million. 
</P>
<P>
Big money losers among the state's 70 prison-based businesses included the 
metal products shop, $761,809; the auto shop, $572,157, and the bakery, 
$531,147, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
At Donovan, the new auto body shop, which posted a $461,548 loss, was also one 
of the bigger losers for the authority, according to the audit. The four other 
Donovan enterprises lost money as well: the laundry, $145,404; the bakery, 
$238,734; the optical laboratory, $438,683, and the computer data entry 
service, $65,609. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Duggan, a prison authority production manager at Donovan, said Tuesday 
that it "isn't fair" to judge the prison businesses based on those figures 
because all five started last year. He said that the authority was hiring 
civilian staff and buying equipment during many of the months covered by the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the businesses have increased their production, Donovan's enterprises 
are projected to turn a profit of $434,000 for the 1990 fiscal year, officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Donovan businesses range from the auto body shop, which Duggan said repairs 
vehicles for local public agencies, to the laundry, which handles 18,000 pounds 
of clothes daily for the prison and two state psychiatric hospitals, including 
Edgemoor. Inmates also make up to 400 pairs of eyeglasses daily for Medi-Cal 
clients and bake 8,500 loaves of bread daily for Donovan and three other state 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry and other Prison Industry Authority officials also said they will take a 
second look at possibly shutting down the auto body shops in San Diego and 
Vacaville. Estimates show the Donovan body shop will break even by the end of 
the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The $276,000 loss for 1989 comes on the heels of a $3.5-million loss in 1988. 
Lowry said the prison industries system is expected to lose $1.7 million in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authority is refining its proposal for a $97-million 
trash-to-energy and recycling plant at Donovan.

LAPD'S FORAY AGAINST DRUGS GETS MIXED WELCOME, INCLUDING AN ANTI-POLICE SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was moments into the Los Angeles Police Department's latest anti-drug 
offensive in the neighborhood around 8th Street and Normandie Avenue -- the 
barricading of intersections in the drug-plagued area -- and already some 
residents had struck up Tuesday what one dubbed the "welcome wagon" band. 
</P>
<P>
While the driving bass line from an anti-police rap song echoed from a sound 
system in a graffiti-scarred Normandie Avenue apartment house, and some 
residents sang along, City Councilman Nate Holden and a handful of 
plain-clothes officers stood across the street and waxed optimistic as the 
latest attempt to wrest the neighborhood from the grip of drug traffickers and 
gang members got under way. 
</P>
<P>
The three-week pilot program -- similar to recent operations in the Pico-Union 
area and San Fernando Valley neighborhoods late last year -- will involve 
officers on foot and in patrol cars from the Wilshire Division station. They 
will concentrate on the barricaded, six-block area bounded by 7th, 9th and 
Irolo streets and Mariposa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most of the residents here are supportive of us and of this program," 
said Police Capt. John Murtz, the song in the background making for an ironic 
sound track to his address. "From the evidence we've seen, we'll be successful 
in keeping out graffiti and people who don't belong in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Holden and Murtz, who called the neighborhood "the No. 1 area for street 
narcotics" in the Wilshire Division, said uniformed and plainclothes officers 
will patrol the area from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. the next morning in an effort to 
scare off the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal element thinks they are in control here," said Holden, the 10th 
District councilman who represents the area. "We want to show them that they 
are not." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents, fearing that their neighborhood would be transformed into a 
police state, questioned the city's motives. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them confusing (innocent people) with the drug dealers or the 
gang bangers," said Frank Donis, 17, the disc jockey spinning the thunderous 
rap song that blared from his apartment. "They'll do that. They'll stop us in 
the street, or coming home, and say, 'Where are the drugs?' " 
</P>
<P>
Other residents looked forward to the imminent crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the drug dealers have built up goodwill with the users," said Lance 
Robbins, who owns one building in the neighborhood and manages two others. "We

when they set up barricades and started an offensive against narcotics dealers. 
But one played a loud, anti-police rap song on his stereo and said innocent 
people might also get rounded up.

The Times should be congratulated for its excellent article on the Los Angeles 
County Human Relations Commission (Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Every agency in our community that deals with diversity and discrimination 
counts on the commission as a source of information and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's assistance and cooperation were instrumental in helping the

PUBLIC'S OPINION OF LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislators indignant anger over a Times Poll which holds them in low 
esteem, unethical and unproductive prompts me to write my first letter ever to 
The Times (Part A, Jan. 3-4). 
</P>
<P>
First of all, I was not part of the state poll. However, it would be difficult 
not to come to the same conclusion as the poll when one reads, almost daily in 
the newspapers, so much about the corruption and indecision of the various 
legislators. It could be argued that a few bad apples do not make the whole 
tree rotten, or a single rose does not make spring. But the extensive number of 
legislators' names, which are continuously in the news in a detrimental manner, 
impair this legislative body as a crack can destroy a dam, or a hole in a 
tanker can ruin a coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I would not have written had not Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) called the poll "an absolute, unadulterated lie." What does he mean 
by such a statement? Does he mean that the people who put the poll together are 
liars? Or is he trying to say that the public is misinformed and does not know 
the true facts, which, incidently, is not what he said. Or that the press 
publishes lies all the time so that the public is misinformed? Or does he not 
know what he means? Or if he does know what he means, why is he unable to 
articulate his meaning accurately? After all, what he stated does not make 
sense since a poll does no more than reflect people's opinions. Brown's 
response just further reflects negatively on his image. 
</P>
<P>
If the Speaker of the Assembly does not make any sense then perhaps we have a 
bigger problem than the poll indicated.

SURPLUS FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(While working at a market) recently, I threw away 196 half-gallons of milk. 
Although this was an unusual occurrence, precipitated by an ordering error, I 
felt like I was committing a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Every week, I trash varying amounts of milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, hot dogs 
and various other deli items. My job is to ensure that there is always adequate 
product on the shelf. The result is some of the product exceeds the expiration 
code and must be thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong with the product. Most dairy products are good for four 
to five days if kept refrigerated. The problem is that there is no mechanism 
for the hungry or malnourished to gain access to these items before I throw 
them in the dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that every grocery store throws away food while people are 
hungry. The solutions are easily worked out, if we simply would possess the 
interest to do something about it.

INVESTING IN POLITICAL INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Money may not be the root of all evil, but the exaggerated influence it gives 
special interests and the corruption it engenders among public officials at all 
levels contribute considerably to the anguish of American democracy today. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the campaign-finance crisis is greater than ever before. For 
example, according to the nonpartisan California Commission on Campaign 
Financing, the amount of money spent to win seats in this state's Legislature 
has risen more than 4,000% over the past three decades. This year alone, total 
campaign spending in legislative contests may come close to $100 million. The 
situation at the federal and municipal levels differs only in absolute size, 
not in degree. 
</P>
<P>
In its most basic form -- the good old-fashioned bribe -- political corruption 
is universally condemned. There is, after all, a general agreement extending 
back to biblical times that the outright exchange of political favors for money 
is wrong. But the bribe's polite cousin -- conflict of interest -- is a 
slightly shiftier character. Even so, there now is a broadening consensus that 
public officials ought not to participate in governmental decisions in which 
they have an economic interest. 
</P>
<P>
But dealing with the corrupting or, for that matter, distorting influence of 
money which enters government through the perfectly legal avenue of the 
campaign-finance system is a complex business. Today's debate in the City 
Council over the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act is a textbook example of the 
problem. Even though the proposed act incorporates many of the reform 
movement's most advanced ideas, the portion of the law dealing with ethical 
conduct in office appears far more palatable to many council members than the 
proposals dealing with the ethical conduct of politics, the campaign-finance 
reform section. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad. Ethical government and ethical politics are inextricably linked. The 
most disturbing of the wave of scandals now afflicting American government at 
all levels invariably have their roots in politicians raising huge sums from 
special interests. Consider the present predicaments of three well-known 
California politicians: U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
and -- more seriously -- state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, who is on trial. The 
most serious of the difficulties in which they are enmeshed stem in some part 
from the ways in which they raised money for their election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
So what is to be done? Piecemeal approaches to the problem -- mostly involving 
greater disclosure and limits on the size and kind of contributions -- have 
been on the political agenda for nearly 20 years. As the evidence indicates, 
partial solutions are not equal to the task. What does seem promising, though, 
is the comprehensive, three-pronged approach incorporated in the City of Los 
Angeles Ethics Act and already adopted in New York City, Seattle, Tucson and 
Sacramento County. The essential reform triad consists of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Voluntary ceilings on campaign expenditures; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limits on the size of contributions; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Partial public financing of campaigns through the mechanism of matching 
funds for those candidates who agree to abide by spending limits and other 
electoral regulations. 
</P>
<P>
True, other steps are also worthwhile, such as Minnesota's restrictions on 
off-year fund-raising and Alaska's tax refunds for small, individual 
contributors or those which match contributions from within a lawmaker's 
district at a higher level than those from without. So is a feature of New 
Jersey's statute, included in the Los Angeles measure, which requires 
recipients of public financing to agree to timely debates. But experience shows 
that campaign-finance reform succeeds only when it incorporates all three of 
the major principles enumerated above. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, simply limiting contributions to candidates, as is the case with 
the House and Senate, did nothing to inhibit the ability of wealthy savings and 
loan executives to win what clearly was an excessively sympathetic hearing from 
Cranston and other lawmakers. California has had rigorous disclosure laws for 
some time and, more recently, a limit on contributions. Yet our electoral 
problems continue to spiral out of control, while public participation and 
confidence in state government plummet. San Francisco's last mayoral election 
was the first conducted with a new, lower limit on contributions, and it was 
the first in the city's history in which every candidate spent more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, by contrast, a decade of experience with the three-point approach 
has produced municipal politics that are widely admired for their integrity, 
competitiveness and openness to women and minority candidates. In New York, 
where four years ago former Mayor Ed Koch outspent his opponents seven to one, 
new rules on public financing, contribution limits and a ceiling on 
expenditures helped produce an election last year that was extremely 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Still, political reform is one of those issues on which serious-minded people 
frequently have legitimate differences. In 1893, for example, California passed 
what was then the nation's most advanced campaign-finance law. Called the 
Purity In Elections Act, it provided, among other things, ceilings on 
expenditures and a prohibition on transfers of funds from one candidate to 
another. It subsequently was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court because it 
regulated primaries -- contests whose rules, the justices held, were purely a 
partisan concern -- as well as general elections. The man who successfully 
argued that position before the high court was a young lawyer named Hiram W. 
Johnson, who less than 20 years later would be swept into the California 
governor's mansion as the standard-bearer of Progressive reform. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, some Los Angeles City Council members have reservations about public 
financing based on what they believe it will cost. Fortunately, the early 
projections that created that anxiety appear unrealistic. Their estimated 
expenditure of more than $20 million over four years includes the cost of an 
ethics commission and staff, which most now agree the city will have in any 
event. Moreover, the projected figure assumes the remote possibility that three 
candidates will qualify for matching funds in every conceivable primary and 
that there will be a runoff in every council race. That strains the limits of 
probability. The projected cost of public financing for New York's recent 
mayoral race was $28 million; the actual cost turned out to be slightly more 
than $4 million. If cost really is a stopper, the simple, though not 
necessarily ideal, solution is write a cap on public financing into the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, the skeptics' approach to this issue neglects the 
hidden costs of the status quo -- costs such as those incurred in the savings 
and loan debacle or in the dozens of city planning decisions taken under the 
watchful eye of wealthy -- and to officeholders, generous -- developers. Not 
least among those hidden costs is the terrible erosion of public confidence 
that leads a majority of Californians to believe their Legislature is on the 
take. Democracy is a hands-on operation, but it does not work if the majority 
of voters believe the levers of government are too dirty to touch. 
</P>
<P>
Public financing of campaigns is the next logical step in that democratic 
American tradition that began with the widest possible extension of the right 
to vote and continues with the effort to ensure that the franchise is exercised 
in equality. To that end, 19th-Century reformers abolished property 
requirements for voters, and progressive thinkers in our own time successfully 
fought to eliminate the poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
The issue being debated in Los Angeles today is a vital chapter in that ongoing 
struggle. By striking at the unwholesome, unequal influence of wealthy special 
interests, the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act holds the promise of an electoral 
system in which the rights and interests of every man and woman are equal not 
only in the eyes of the law, but also in the eyes of the lawmakers.

LEBANON IN THE SOVIET CAUCASUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Red Army general bluntly describes the ethnic conflict now raging in 
Azerbaijan as civil war. The Soviet press, which not long ago avoided reporting 
news even of common crimes or aircraft accidents, relates in gory detail the 
random murders, arson and mutilations carried out by Azerbaijanis and Armenians 
and pronounces events to be "out of control." The government has responded by 
declaring a state of emergency in parts of Azerbaijan and sending in thousands 
of troops, though with what effect is still to be seen. Muslim Azerbaijani and 
Christian Armenian gangs appear to be remarkably, if mysteriously, well-armed. 
Their conflict, moreover, is fed by passions that even the threat of superior 
firepower is unlikely to restrain. 
</P>
<P>
Many nightmares haunt the Soviet Union of Mikhail Gorbachev. Among the worst of 
these, in an empire peopled by more than 100 disparate and often discordant 
ethnic groups, is the ever-present danger of communal strife and nationalistic 
self-assertion. The confrontation between Azerbaijanis and Armenians reflects 
animosities that are ancient and seemingly uncompromisable, and it is as 
pointless to search for immediate causes for the newest outbreak of violence 
between them as it is to look for immediate solutions. For most of its history 
the Soviet state was able to suppress intercommunal tensions by the use or 
threat of brute force or mass deportations. A more civilized regime now shuns 
these methods, even as it searches desperately for effective alternative means 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
The long history of the Caucasus is spattered by repeated episodes of 
turbulence and bloodshed. The great concern now is that the region could be 
approaching a process of Lebanonization, of bloody intercommunal warfare where 
each side will fight with a blind fanaticism because each feels that its very 
survival may be at stake. It is a frightening possibility. It is also, all too 
clearly, a wholly realistic one.

<P>
A Santee woman was in serious condition Tuesday after she was shot by her 
estranged husband, who then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ann Price, 33, was shot once in the head by Robert Allan Price, 28, who 
shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ann Price was in the intensive care unit at Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
"She's awake, she's alert," hospital spokeswoman Caty van Housen said. "She's 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The incident is being treated as an attempted murder and suicide by Sheriff's 
Department homicide detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Chuck Curtis said the incident began about 9 p.m. Monday when Robert Allan 
Price went to his estranged wife's apartment, in the 11000 block of Woodside 
Avenue. The couple argued and the woman ran out of her home about 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Allan Price chased her, catching up with his wife at a gate in a walkway 
in the apartment complex, Curtis said. He shot her once in the head, then shot 
himself, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said the woman's 13-year-old daughter witnessed the shooting. Three of 
the woman's younger children were asleep in the apartment during the argument 
and the shooting. All four children are now in the care of the woman's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner George Dickason said Robert Allan Price was pronounced dead at 
the scene. Dickason said Price lived in the 1200 block of Railroad Street in 
Jacumba.

<P>
A downtown San Diego bank Tuesday morning became the eighth financial 
institution within six weeks to be robbed by what police believe is the same 
man. 
</P>
<P>
The latest robbery was at Security Pacific Bank, 1200 3rd Ave., said Bill 
Robinson, San Diego police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The robber handed a teller a note demanding money, saying that he had a gun. He 
made off with $1,120 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Police and FBI agents have dubbed the robberies "The Leave Note for FBI 
Series," because the robber told tellers in the first and second heists to give 
the notes to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the series began Dec. 4 when the robber got $600 from a Bank of 
America branch at 450 B St. It was followed by robberies at First Interstate 
Bank, Union Bank, World Savings, Great American Bank and Coast Savings, all in 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The robber is described as a white male, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with 
dark brown, neck-length hair. He has a receding hairline, with a part on the 
left side. The man is clean-shaven, has high cheekbones and is about 30 years 
old.

<P>
A San Diego police officer was justified in shooting a robbery suspect in 
December, a district attorney's investigation has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Gerald K. Griffin fired four shots at Curlee Markson Jr., purportedly 
after he saw Markson attacking another man with a knife. The incident occurred 
about 9:30 p.m. Dec. 3 in the 4300 block of University Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Jan. 10, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael R. Pent wrote that 
Griffin told Markson to drop the knife. Instead of dropping the weapon, Markson 
turned toward the officer, who was now within a few feet of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Griffin fired two shots at Markson, fearing that the apparent victim 
(Jose Hernandez-Garcia) might be injured or killed by the knife-wielding 
assailant. Markson was not hit by either shot," Pent wrote in the letter to 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
Markson ran away, with Griffin in pursuit. After several blocks, Markson ran 
into an alley. Griffin fired two more shots at Markson and hit him once in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts in this case establish legal justification for the use of deadly 
force by Officer Griffin," Pent wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Markson was armed with a deadly weapon, was in the process of threatening 
Hernandez-Garcia with it in an attempt to rob him, failed to drop it when 
confronted . . . and in fact took the knife with him as he tried to escape. The 
use of deadly force to arrest is proper if the crime for which the arrest is 
sought is a forcible and atrocious one which threatens death or serious bodily 
harm." 
</P>
<P>
Pent said Markson was charged with attempted robbery and assault with a deadly 
weapon. Markson is scheduled to appear Jan. 30 in Superior Court. He is in 
County Jail downtown, on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Lt. Gary Learn said there were 23 officer-involved shootings in 1989, 
seven of them fatal. Two of the incidents are still under investigation. The 
others, he said, were found to be justified.

A 90-day construction moratorium for more than 3,100 acres around Brown Field 
was tentatively approved Tuesday by the San Diego City Council in an effort to 
preserve the city-owned general aviation airstrip for possible expansion into a 
major airport. 
</P>
<P>
If it receives final approval, the moratorium proposed by Councilman Ron 
Roberts will delay development while the San Diego Assn. of Governments 
determines whether the Otay Mesa airstrip can be expanded to relieve Lindbergh 
Field of some commercial airline traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag is reviewing a private consultant's report that indicates that two 
southwest to northeast runways could be built on Brown Field, allowing a 
possible "multiple airport solution" to the longstanding and worsening problem 
of crowding at Lindbergh, the region's only major airport. The Sandag response 
is due within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, land situated roughly in a swath where the two parallel runways 
would be put was included in the building moratorium. However, 240 acres of 
subdivisions where industrial projects are close to breaking ground were 
exempted from Roberts' original ban, which covered about 3,400 acres.

SPEEDY BURROUGHS RACES PAST ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fast five, those Alhambra High Moors. So fast, in fact, that they almost swiped 
the Foothill League lead this past week quicker than you could say "Stop, 
thief." 
</P>
<P>
The Moors threatened to run Burroughs out of its own gym Tuesday night with a 
fast and furious, who-has-the-ball-now? 25-point second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Burroughs, the defending league champion, showed speed of its own, rolling 
up a 32-point fourth quarter to hand Alhambra an 80-70 loss at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're guard-oriented and they penetrate," Burroughs Coach Ira Sollod said. 
"We just had to catch our breath." 
</P>
<P>
With no player taller than 6-foot-1, Alhambra (14-3, 2-1 in league play) relied 
on hustle rather than muscle, moving the ball the way the Kings do the puck. 
The Moors used perfectly executed trailer passes and shots off assists to 
nullify a five-point first-quarter Burroughs' lead and take a 36-28 halftime 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Hung Duong, averaging 24.9 points, scored 19 points -- 12 in the first 
half. Sixth man Hon Trieu, who entered the game with 35 three-point baskets, 
added six more toward a team-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They were swinging the ball pretty good," said Burroughs forward S. J. 
Boldvich, who scored 13 points to go with 12 rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ray Velasquez, who scored a game-high 27 points, nullified Alhambra's 
penetration by breaking loose on several fast breaks in the fourth quarter.

SHOUP FIRING NOT TIED TO SCIAC MOVE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran President Jerry Miller announced at a Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meeting on May 3 that the 1989 season would 
be Bob Shoup's last as the school's football coach, but SCIAC sources deny that 
Shoup's dismissal was a prerequisite of Cal Lutheran's admittance into their 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's announcement to the SCIAC and to several Cal Lutheran administrators 
and faculty members preceded, by more than three months, the public 
announcement of Shoup's dismissal August 8. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel as though our conference tried to impose pressure on anybody 
about that," said Curt Tong, Pomona-Pitzer's athletic director. "I don't think 
it had anything to do with the personnel. I think the SCIAC's concern centered 
around athletic scholarships. Our only real reservations about withholding 
membership centered on that fact." 
</P>
<P>
During the May 3 meeting at Cal Lutheran, Miller gave athletic directors and 
faculty-athletic representatives from the SCIAC schools and Cal Lutheran a 
progress report on his school's transition from the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division II, which grants athletic scholarships, to the 
non-scholarship Division III SCIAC. 
</P>
<P>
"He indicated that at this point, CLU is on track" in the transition, the 
minutes read. "Some of the part-time coaching positions, for example, 
basketball, are shifting to full-time status, and the present football coach 
will conclude his coaching duties at CLU at the end of the 1989 season." 
</P>
<P>
A background paper prepared for the Cal Lutheran Board of Regents by Regent Jim 
Tyner points out that the SCIAC football coaches recommended that Cal Lutheran 
not be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"The only negative recommendation we had was from the football coaches," said 
John Zinda, the athletic director and football coach at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 
who said the vote was 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
According to Zinda, the coaches in 15 sports voted on Cal Lutheran's 
admittance. 
</P>
<P>
"The propriety of SCIAC schools attempting to dictate (Cal Lutheran's) 
personnel practices is left to your judgment," Tyner writes. 
</P>
<P>
However, SCIAC sources contend that Shoup, who fought Cal Lutheran's move to 
the SCIAC, was not the reason for their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely don't think there was a vendetta against Shoup," said Dale 
Widolff, football coach at Occidental. However, Widolff added, "It's public 
knowledge that he didn't want to be in the SCIAC, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Widolff emphasized Cal Lutheran's institutional advantages in football, 
mentioning the university's association with the Dallas Cowboys, since 
terminated, and the name recognition gained from having played at a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was let them get rid of (scholarships) and then we'll let them 
get into the conference," Zinda said.

LOVEALL BARRED FROM WESTLAKE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Loveall of Newbury Park High, suspended last week for trying to punch a 
Westlake player after a Marmonte League basketball game, will not be allowed to 
compete in the Jan. 29 rematch between the schools, according to Newbury Park's 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Loveall, a 6-foot-8 senior who averages 10.6 points and 11.2 rebounds a game, 
was suspended from school for three days last week and sat out Newbury Park's 
88-61 loss to Simi Valley on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park Coach Greg Ropes had feared that Loveall would not be allowed to 
play tonight in a home game against Camarillo, but Athletic Director Bill 
Manzer gave him clearance. Loveall had returned to the team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
During Newbury Park's 67-62 loss to Westlake on Jan. 8, Loveall was involved in 
a shoving match with Westlake's Matt Weaver early in the fourth quarter that 
resulted in Loveall's fifth personal foul and subsequent ejection. A videotape 
of the game shows Loveall pushing Weaver and swinging at the 6-3 senior as 
players were shaking hands after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Coach Greg Hess said that Loveall should be allowed to play against 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
"He learned his lesson, so let the kid back on the court," Hess said. "Let him 
play against us and prove he's a class act and give him a chance to beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Ropes said he is pleased that the team's leading rebounder and third-leading 
scorer can return to the lineup. Newbury Park will attempt to snap a six-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"He practiced Friday and had a real good practice," Ropes said. "He'll be ready 
to roll."JEFF RILEY

<P>
AS OKERT SITS OUT CASTLE PARK STANDS OVER MONTGOMERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even 19 minutes after she was ejected, Castle Park's Erica Okert still felt 
like a woman scorned. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my balance," Okert protested Tuesday night after being forced to watch 
Castle Park defeat host Montgomery, 71-58, almost entirely from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:14 left in the second quarter and the Trojans leading, 28-25, referee 
Dave Dendy called Okert, the conferences' second leading rebounder, for 
intentionally elbowing Montgomery's Monica Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
"She elbowed the girl," Dendy said. He said it was not only intentional, "it 
was flagrant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was an important call for both sides. Montgomery either gets a break because 
a wrench is thrown in Castle Park's big rebounding game, or the Trojans get 
angry and inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Well, wouldn't you know it. Castle Park goes ahead, 40-31, at the half and 
extends it by more each quarter. Montgomery never lead after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost Erica, they responded well," first-year Coach Chuck Mills said. 
"The rest of the girls had to pick up quite a load. Christina (Murguia) picked 
up her game quite a bit and Debbie Davis had a phenomenal game." 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, Christina. All the county's second leading scorer (30.1 average going 
into this game) did was score 36 points and pull down 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it could go either way," said Murguia. "By the end of the second 
quarter we started playing our game." 
</P>
<P>
That's when the Trojans had adjusted to the Aztecs' tough press. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced breaking their press all week, but at first we didn't because 
they're so quick." 
</P>
<P>
But Montgomery (12-5, 6-1) was having its own problems, pertaining mostly to 
its shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed everything," Montgomery Coach Lori Morris said. "We never do that. 
But (Castle Park) looked great." 
</P>
<P>
Brooke Scarborough and Claudia Medina each had 16 points for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mills of his defending league champion Trojans: "We're building a program 
here, and we don't want to lose. We're building for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The victory put more flavor in an already scrumptious league race, as the 
Trojans (12-3, 6-1) moved into a tie for the conference lead after the first 
round. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: PADRES SIGN CLEMENTS TO ONE-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Padre reliever Pat Clements signed a one-year, $245,000 contract Tuesday, 
becoming the only eligible Padre player to forego arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Benito Santiago, third baseman Mike Pagliarulo, and pitchers Calvin 
Schiraldi and Mark Grant all exercised their rights to file for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, Padre manager-vice president/baseball operations, said that he is 
hopeful of reaching agreement with each of the four players. The two sides will 
exchange salary figures Friday, and if the Padres are unable to reach agreement 
with any of the four players, arbitration hearings will be scheduled Feb. 
1-Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Clements, who earned $205,000 last season, is expected to compete with Dan 
Murphy, Eric Nolte and Rafael Valdez for the final spot in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"His status might depend on whether we want one left-hander or two left-handers 
in the pen," McKeon said. "Really, he's in the same role as last year, just 
vying for a position." 
</P>
<P>
Clements, who was 4-1 with a 3.92 ERA last season, said: "I've always been a 
middle man, and I really don't see my role changing. I just want to be a part 
of this team, because I think we're going to be as good as anybody in the 
league." BOB NIGHTENGALE

FRIENDS THOUGHT STORY OF SLAYING WAS JUST AN ACT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BRADLEY MINKOFF KEPT SAYING HE HAD KILLED HIS BROTHER, ACCORDING TO 
SEVERAL ACTORS WHO THOUGHT HE WAS MIMICKING JAMES DEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura Hills teen-ager sought by sheriff's deputies after the New Year's Eve 
shooting death of his brother spent the last two weeks with actor friends in 
the San Fernando Valley who said he told them repeatedly that he had committed 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Several of his friends this week said they disregarded Bradley Marc Minkoff's 
story because he appeared to be mimicking his idol, brooding 1950s actor James 
Dean, and reciting melodramatic bits of movie dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to be a running gag because we thought that he was just acting," said 
Todd Antony Bello, 29, of West Hollywood, an actor and documentary filmmaker 
who socialized with Minkoff several times during the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bello said Minkoff told him he had shot his brother because he was a drug 
dealer. "He said, 'I was always the good one in the family,' " Bello recalled. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police converged on an actor's North Hollywood apartment where 
Minkoff had been staying. The officers arrested Minkoff, 18, on a warrant 
charging him with the murder of his brother, Michael, 20. 
</P>
<P>
"All week he's been telling me this, and now I find out it's true," Bello said. 
"I'm in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Bello and others connected with the Magnolia Playhouse in North Hollywood said 
they did not tie Minkoff to the recent killing because he called himself Johnny 
Boy, a nickname that came from the character played by Robert De Niro in the 
movie "Mean Streets." 
</P>
<P>
He told his friends his true name was Martin Fallon, who the actors later 
learned was a character in the film "A Prayer for the Dying," starring another 
of the teen-ager's idols, Mickey Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Bergstrom, a Cal State Northridge student who is friendly with some of the 
actors, said she and her father realized "Johnny Boy" was Minkoff after they 
saw his photograph in a newspaper article about the Agoura Hills slaying. She 
said her father told sheriff's investigators where the youth was staying, 
leading to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept telling everybody he had killed his brother for two weeks, and nobody 
believed him," said Bergstrom, a North Hollywood resident. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said they do not believe the actors knew they were 
sheltering a fugitive. "He had been at that apartment and hanging out with 
those people since New Year's Eve," sheriff's investigator Bill Gaynor said. "I 
don't have any belief that these people harbored him. They didn't know who he 
was. We were contacted once they put two and two together." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager told the actors he was having problems with his family and needed 
a place to stay temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Minkoff brought a nickel-plated magnum revolver to a comedy play 
rehearsal at the Magnolia Playhouse in North Hollywood, the actors said. He 
loaned it to them for a skit involving an armed gangster. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Oakley, artistic director at the playhouse, said he examined the weapon 
to make sure it was not loaded. Although it was used during one rehearsal, 
Oakley said he asked the actors to resume using a prop revolver after that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a gun that I didn't want to have around the theater," Oakley said. "That 
was basically a Dirty Harry type of gun," referring to the violent Clint 
Eastwood film series. 
</P>
<P>
The slim, red-haired youth, wearing handcuffs and a blue Los Angeles County 
Jail jumpsuit, was led into Malibu Municipal Court Tuesday morning for 
arraignment on a single count of first-degree murder, with a special allegation 
that a firearm was used. 
</P>
<P>
Minkoff's attorney, Dennis E. Mulcahy, declined to enter a plea, asking instead 
that the arraignment be postponed so he could review the police reports. Judge 
Lawrence J. Mira rescheduled the arraignment for Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Mulcahy also asked the judge to set bail at $100,000 to allow Minkoff's release 
to the custody of his parents, Barbara and David Minkoff, who were in the 
courtroom. "As the court can see, Bradley has no prior offenses," Mulcahy said. 
"There doesn't appear to be a history of violence on Bradley's part. They'd 
like to have their son home. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything to indicate anyone else would be in danger." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Loni Petersen challenged the bail motion, pointing out that 
Minkoff had fled authorities for two weeks after the shooting. She added, "The 
defendant has a preoccupation with death." 
</P>
<P>
Mira set bail at $1.5 million, describing it as "a reasonable bail under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Mulcahy and Minkoff's parents declined to comment on the case after the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's reports released Tuesday stated that deputies heard a gunshot and a 
crashing sound during a 911 call that originated from the Minkoffs' Dargan 
Street home at 11:22 a.m. on Dec. 31. The deputies who responded found Michael 
Minkoff, a Moorpark College engineering student, face down on the kitchen floor 
in a pool of blood, with the phone receiver by his left hand. He was pronounced 
dead at the scene, with gunshot wounds to the head and upper chest. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor told deputies she had seen Bradley Minkoff drive away from the home 
that morning in the family's blue Volvo. A friend of Michael's told deputies 
the brothers had quarreled the previous night while he was visiting the house. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara and David Minkoff were vacationing in Cancun, Mexico, when the shooting 
occurred. In the sheriff's reports, they described Bradley as "a very reliable 
child who does not drink, smoke or take drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But they also expressed concern because Bradley had purchased a handgun shortly 
before they left for Mexico. They told deputies that Michael was worried that 
Bradley had become too much of a loner, keeping to himself inside his room. 
</P>
<P>
The Minkoffs told deputies their sons had opposite personalities. They said 
Michael had joined them on a recent snow skiing trip, but Bradley chose to stay 
home. Deputies said the parents told them that "Bradley has no close friends, 
no girlfriends, no boyfriends, whereas Michael had a lot of friends and a 
girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
They also said Michael was adopted, although Bradley was the couple's natural 
child. 
</P>
<P>
In the home, investigators examined poetic writing and cartoons, apparently 
done by Bradley, dealing with subjects such as death, murder, sex and actor 
Mickey Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Bello said he met Bradley Minkoff last fall at a Valley drive-in 
restaurant that was sponsoring a 1950s memorabilia festival, including a 
display of James Dean collectibles. Bello said he interviewed Minkoff for a 
documentary he is making about obsessed James Dean fans. 
</P>
<P>
Bello said they became reacquainted just before Christmas when a mutual friend 
brought Minkoff to meet author John Gilmore, who wrote a book about Dean and is 
assisting with Bello's documentary. "He did every mannerism, every speech of 
James Dean," Gilmore said of his meetings with the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore, a former actor, said he asked Minkoff if he planned to pursue that 
career. "He said, 'I do all my acting in real life,' " Gilmore recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Michael Connelly also contributed to this story.

HEAVY RAINS SOAK LIBRARY BOOKS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks Library, which has experienced leaks since it opened eight 
years ago, suffered its worst water damage to date during heavy rains last 
weekend and its roof and gutters may have to be replaced, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Library Services Marvin Smith said "dozens and dozens" of books had 
been ruined, including six to eight rare volumes on the history and art of book 
binding. An assessment of damages was still under way Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Smith said, large areas of carpet were soaked and buckling, paint 
was peeling off the walls in his office, and the computer room had been 
inundated with half an inch of water Saturday night. The computer was not 
damaged, however. 
</P>
<P>
The library was closed Sunday for cleaning and immediate repairs, and again 
Monday for Martin Luther King's birthday. It reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and City Manager Grant W. Brimhall said the 60,000-square-foot library, 
which cost $9 million to build, has had leaks since it opened in 1982. Both 
officials attributed most of the leaks to an inadequate gutter system and said 
previous discussions with the architect and contractor had proven futile. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the architect, Albert C. Martin and Associates of Los Angeles, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Brimhall estimated the city had spent between $50,000 and $100,000 on temporary 
repairs and said "more dramatic action" seems necessary, such as complete 
replacement of the roof and gutters. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have a library that leaks," Brimhall said. "People come to the 
library to read books, not take showers." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Mark Sellers said he would review a file on the history of problems 
at the library before deciding whether to file a lawsuit. But Brimhall said he 
hoped to avoid going to court. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks Library, whose modern design has won several awards, holds 
265,000 volumes and circulates 1.4 million materials a year, an amount 
comparable to the circulation of all 17 branches of Ventura County's library 
system, Smith said.

PROSECUTOR SAYS FINGERPRINTS TIE GRANDSON TO MAN'S SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE TRIAL BEGINS IN THE CASE OF A STRUGGLING ACTOR AND MUSICIAN CHARGED 
WITH A 1983 KILLING. 
</P>

<P>
More than six years after his grandfather was found beaten and shot to death in 
North Hollywood, Noel P. Scott, 27, listened Tuesday in San Fernando Superior 
Court as a prosecutor argued that Scott had committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Opening statements began Tuesday in the trial of Scott, a struggling actor and 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was charged last February with murder in the October, 1983, slaying of 
Louis Fox, 70, after Charles Berkowitz, a childhood friend of Scott's, 
implicated him while in custody on suspicion of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Scott of Hollywood has denied the killing. He has said that he was at a 
Hollywood club on the night of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sidney D. Trapp Jr. said Tuesday that fingerprints on a 
flashlight found near the body indicates that Scott committed the Oct. 16, 
1983, slaying in Fox's home. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence suggests that Fox knew his killer, Trapp said. Although the room 
was not ransacked, Fox's jewelry was stolen from a hiding place, indicating 
that the killer knew where the jewelry was kept, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp said the testimony of Berkowitz, 26, and Scott's former girlfriend will 
suggest that Scott planned and executed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp said Scott's former girlfriend will testify that several weeks before the 
crime, she rejected Scott's proposal of marriage because he was "a bit of a 
loser" with no future prospects. 
</P>
<P>
He told her that his financial difficulties would soon be over because he was 
going to inherit his grandfather's estate, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, after he was arrested on suspicion of burglary, Berkowitz 
gave investigators information that prompted them to reopen the investigation 
into Fox's killing. 
</P>
<P>
During a preliminary hearing last June, Berkowitz testified that two days after 
the slaying, Scott asked Berkowitz how to change fingerprints and how to beat a 
lie detector test. 
</P>
<P>
Scott later asked his help in pawning a large diamond, Berkowitz testified. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp said Tuesday that the diamond came from one of Fox's rings. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he contacted police about the Scott case, Berkowitz accepted a 
plea bargain with the district attorney's office and pleaded guilty to two 
counts of burglary. He was sentenced to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Three other counts against him were dropped.

<P>
SOVIET UNION: A SEEMINGLY POWERLESS MOSCOW STANDS BY AS ARMENIANS ARE 
SLAUGHTERED IN AZERBAIJAN. THE JEWS AND RUSSIANS WILL BE NEXT. 
</P>

<P>
The new round of savage killings of Armenians in Baku, the capital of Soviet 
Azerbaijan, underscores the Soviet government's inability to deal effectively 
with its ethnic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Russians and Jews peacefully coexisted in Baku for 
decades. But the fragile balance has been irretrievably upset and the central 
government seems powerless to restore order to this picturesque city on the 
shores of the Caspian Sea. Even the state of emergency declared elsewhere in 
Azerbaijan this week cannot call back the violence that has claimed many lives 
and ruined others. 
</P>
<P>
Residents proudly recall the rich history of an international city steeped in 
tradition and blessed with a moderate climate, vast natural resources and an 
ideal location. But during a recent visit to Baku, I saw the signs of a city in 
decline everywhere. The billboard on the road from the airport reads in 
Russian, "The U.S.S.R. -- Home for All Peoples." But one rarely hears Russian 
spoken anymore in a city in which just two years ago more than half the people 
were native Russian speakers. Today, the language of power in Baku is Azeri, 
and non-Azerbaijanis are not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians have been the subject of brutal attacks on the streets and in their 
homes. Streets that only a few months ago had Armenian names now carry 
Azerbaijani names. Statues of Armenians have all been destroyed. The Armenian 
church, which until last month remained unscathed, has been desecrated. In 
short, all public traces of Armenian culture and history are gone. 
</P>
<P>
An influx of Azerbaijanis who were living in neighboring Soviet Armenia is the 
primary trigger of this transformation. Extremist nationalist elements in the 
Armenian population terrorized Azerbaijani inhabitants into leaving Soviet 
Armenia. One Jewish woman now living in Baku told me that all 115 Azerbaijani 
newcomers attending the institute at which she works arrived in Baku with limbs 
missing or mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijanis fleeing Soviet Armenia have therefore come to Baku bent on 
vengeance. These newcomers, known pejoratively throughout Baku as Yerazi 
(Yeravan Azerbaijanis), have bolstered the ranks of the Popular Front, an 
extremist nationalist organization in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front has wrought havoc on Baku, visiting virtually every 
enterprise in the city, requiring the firing of all Armenian employees. And on 
the streets, one must carry an internal passport to show that he or she is not 
Armenian. Armenians fear for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The nationalists are orchestrating a concerted campaign to secede from the 
Soviet Union to create a separate union with southern Azerbaijan, which is now 
part of neighboring northern Iran. The Popular Front's reign of terror in Baku 
is part of this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan has fled. Only the most 
defiant, or those deluding themselves that the situation will get better, have 
stayed. I met one woman who had lost her job the day before. She was married to 
a Russian, her last name was Russian -- but one parent was Armenian. Someone at 
work found out, and she was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Other minority populations are also in danger. While walking to a store, a man 
was accosted on the street. He had forgotten his internal passport showing that 
he was Jewish. The Azerbaijani marauders were looking for Armenians. They 
addressed him in Armenian, which he did not understand. He told them in Russian 
that he was Jewish, so they addressed him in a language spoken among some Jews. 
He knew a few words, convincing his assailants that he was Jewish. They let him 
go, but warned him that once they rid the city of Armenians, the Jews would be 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani "collaborators" are also subject to attack. While I was in Baku, an 
older Azerbaijani man helped a longtime neighbor and friend -- an Armenian. In 
retaliation, a gang of about 15 youths came to his apartment, beat him up and 
stole his jewelry and clothes. There are similar instances of Azerbaijanis 
helping neighbors or friends, but the bonds that preserved the peace have 
unraveled. The city has all but fallen into the hands of the Popular Front. 
</P>
<P>
I attended a dinner at which former grade-school classmates who had known each 
other for more than 15 years gathered for probably the last time. Most were 
products of mixed marriages from a time when tolerance and understanding 
reigned in this international city. 
</P>
<P>
These lifelong friends will soon scatter to all parts of the globe to escape. 
They recognize that they are re-enacting similar exoduses from Berlin in the 
'30's or Beirut in the '70's -- in both instances, great cities on the verge of 
calamity. 
</P>
<P>
All remaining Armenians will soon leave; then the Jews. Then it will not be 
safe for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
The great, tolerant and prosperous city that once was has vanished.

VICTORY HAS HIGH PRICE FOR CLIPPERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: RON HARPER SCORES 33 POINTS, THEN GOES DOWN WITH A KNEE INJURY 
IN FOURTH QUARTER OF 106-98 WIN OVER CHARLOTTE HORNETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Clippers may have felt like carrying Ron Harper around on their shoulders 
before, but this surely wasn't a sight they ever wanted: Harper being driven 
from the Sports Arena locker room to the parking lot on a golf cart, his right 
leg extended. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the lasting memory of a night when he scored a game-high 33 points to 
lead the Clippers past the Charlotte Hornets, 106-98, at the Sports Arena. 
Whether it was precaution or a harbinger of bad news will be known today, when 
Harper undergoes a magnetic resonance imaging exam -- an advanced X-ray -- on 
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's a sprain," said Dr. Tony Daly, the team physician, "but we'll 
know more tomorrow (today). There doesn't seem to be any ligament damage or 
serious injury. But he did feel a pop when he went down." 
</P>
<P>
That pop is what worries the Clippers most and why Harper, their leading 
scorer, didn't return after his leg buckled upon landing while catching a Gary 
Grant pass under the basket with 7:04 to play. He otherwise seemed fit, but the 
sound provided something of a red flag, although Daly cautions that the injury 
may, actually, be nothing worse than a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt tight to him, and the way the injury happened we'd rather let him sit 
out and decide more tomorrow," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper didn't come out of the training room to say exactly what happened. But 
his play spoke volumes in his fifth 30-plus point game as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
Returning from a much-ballyhooed 5-3 trip, which included a 10-point victory at 
Charlotte, the Clippers struggled to win. 
</P>
<P>
A loss to the Hornets, the only winless road team in the league, would seem to 
have been devastating to their sudden credibility. But not to Coach Don Casey, 
who afterward emphatically tried to put things in perspective after his team 
improved to 16-19. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort wasn't disappointing," he said. "Let's get one thing straight -- 
these kids are not going to be superstars every night. Give them (the Hornets) 
credit. They stopped our good break and made some good plays. Our effort was 
strong. It's just our execution wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Added Grant, who had 18 assists and 11 points: "Everyone knew they would be 
hard to play. We knew we wouldn't blow them out. This was almost like a road 
game because we hadn't played here in so long." 
</P>
<P>
Since Dec. 30, to be exact. The crowd of 10,120 welcomed the Clippers back to 
the Sports Arena with a partial standing ovation during introduction of the 
starting lineup, which, as expected, had Danny Manning at forward ahead of Ken 
Norman. Part of that was because Manning shot 57.4% on the just-completed trip; 
the rest because Norman had not played since Jan. 2 because of a strained 
groin. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'd like to go back into the starting lineup, but I can't put a 
whole lot of emphasis on that," Norman said before the game. "The bottom line 
is winning. I've never played off the bench before, but neither has Danny. I'll 
just have to go out and play as good or better than before." 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who began the night averaging 16 points a game, third-best on the team, 
showed no signs of the injury that limited his mobility for three consecutive 
outings before coaches decided to send him home from the trip. In 13 first-half 
minutes, he had five points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
That helped the Clippers take a 54-48 halftime lead. They shot 51.2% and led by 
as many as many as 12 points, 54-42, on Norman's layup with 2:05 left in the 
second quarter, before the Hornets cut the deficit to six at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Harper had 21 points by then and Benoit Benjamin had 11 of his season-high 20 
rebounds. The Clipper advantage would have been more if not for the 18 points 
by Charlotte's Kelly Tripucka, who capitalized on a soft defense outside to hit 
six of 11 shots in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
When Tripucka connected on a jump shot from the left side 3:14 into the second 
half for two of his 30 points, the Clipper lead was trimmed to 57-56, prompting 
Casey to call time out. Soon after, when Stuart Gray took an inside feed from 
Tripucka, was fouled and made one free throw, it was 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers went on a 14-5 third-quarter run for a 72-63 lead -- and blew it. 
And then some. Charlotte used a 13-2 surge moments later to take a 76-74 edge 
heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers led, 89-84, when Harper went down. They almost followed, the 
Hornets moving ahead, 94-93, with 4:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers answered with a 9-0 run to finish off the Hornets after playing 
back to 96-96. Charles Smith's 14-footer gave the Clippers a 98-96 lead with 
3:33 to play. He had five of the nine points and Norman four in the run. 
</P>
<P>
The next important answer comes today. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
X-rays Monday on the left knee of Tom Garrick proved negative, but the Clipper 
guard reported pain Tuesday and did not dress. He tested the bruise while 
shooting around about an hour before the game, but Garrick said he felt some 
soreness, so coaches held him out . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper was named NBA player of the week. He averaged 23.8 points, 6.3 
assists and 5.3 rebounds in four games.

Ladies . . . and gentlemen! Preeee-senting! Our main event! Ten rounds of 
boxing -- if you want to call it boxing! Or less than 10, depending on which of 
these old coots collapses first! 
</P>
<P>
"Innn . . . this corner, in the dark trunks! With the dark eyebrows and the 
darker future! Weighing in at 231 pounds, much of it in his head! He lost to 
Larry Holmes! He lost to Michael Spinks! You've lost money betting on him! 
Gerrrry . . . Gooney! 
</P>
<P>
"Andddd . . . in this corner! In the light trunks! An incredibly large pair of 
light trunks, may we add! Weighing in at 253 1/4 pounds, at least before this 
morning's breakfast! Theformer heavyweight champion of the world, heavier than 
ever! The man who wants his belt back, only several sizes larger! Georrrrge . . 
. Forehead! 
</P>
<P>
"Your referee . . . Howie Bilkum!" 
</P>
<P>
"OK, boys, here are your instructions: Let's have a good, clean fight. No 
kidney punches, no rabbit punches, no love-handle grabbing, no punches below 
the waist, assuming you can find George's waist. 
</P>
<P>
"When I say 'break,' make sure you break. I'd get between you, but there's not 
enough room in the ring for the three of us. I'll be standing right out there 
on the apron if you need me. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerry, if you get hurt, you be sure to tell me, because it's hard to tell when 
you're punchy from your natural state. When you fall -- excuse me, if you fall 
-- please be careful, because this is a brand new canvas and we don't want it 
damaged. Fall softly. 
</P>
<P>
"George, you can't wear that helmet into the ring. Oh, I see . . . that's not a 
helmet, that's your head. OK, fine. Stay away from Gerry's ribs. Stay away from 
his cole slaw and fries. When you hear the bell, George, that means the round 
is over, and not that dinner is served. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, boys, shake hands and come out fighting. And may the best man win. Sorry, 
Gerry. They make me say that." 
</P>
<P>
"Hello again, everybody, I'm Jim Lampshade, here to do the blow-by-blow on 
tonight's pay-per-view telecast, and we hope somebody lands at least one blow. 
We're sure you're going to get your money's worth. Sorry. They make me say 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you've all heard how this fight's been promoted: 'The Preacher and the 
Puncher.' 'The Geezers at Caesars.' 'Jerk and the Fat Man.' 'Two Heifers Come 
to Jersey!' 'The Dopes on the Ropes.' 
</P>
<P>
"Before the bell sounds, we'd like to apologize to our viewers for this camera 
angle from the top row of the arena. It was the only way we could get both of 
these fighters into the same frame. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, here we go! Paramedics are standing by! Neither fighter is breathing 
particularly hard at this point, but of course the fight hasn't started yet! 
Gerry Gooney looks completely recovered from his shadow-boxing injury, when he 
took six stitches from a punch by his shadow. George Forehead looks formidable 
in his white trunks and matching truss. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting for the bell now. The 33-year-old Gooney vs. the 41-year-old Forehead. 
The aging bulls! Winner of this bout gets a probable shot at either Mike Tyson 
or Evander Holyfield, who are both at ringside, laughing their heads off. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's the bell! Round 1! Gooney crosses the ring, circles, starts out 
slowly, feels Forehead out . . . and he's down! Gerry Gooney is down! 
</P>
<P>
"His corner seems to be throwing in the towel! No, it's only to wipe up the wet 
spot where he fell! George Forehead has gone back to his corner! He seems to be 
eating a baloney-and-cheese sandwich! Ick! I don't think George should be 
drinking from that bucket! 
</P>
<P>
"The referee is counting over Gooney! Five . . . six . . . seven . . . he's up! 
Gerry's corner is advising him to stay down until eight! Gerry is confused, 
because it's only 7:30! The ref's checking Gooney now to see if he's all right! 
He's asking Gerry how many fingers he's holding up. Gerry's saying he couldn't 
have answered that question before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, he's letting them continue! Here comes George, charging out of his corner! 
Uh, oh! He's gotta go back now, to put the sandwich down! Gooney attacks! A 
left! A right! Another left! Uh, oh! George is turning around now! He's facing 
Gerry now! Gerry's running away now! 
</P>
<P>
"Wow! Look at that! That's incredible! What grace! What footwork! I've never 
seen moves like that! Well, enough about the ring girl! On with the fight! 
George throws a punch! Misses by a mile! And Gooney is down again! That's the 
hardest he has almost been hit in his life! 
</P>
<P>
"Seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . that's it! The alleged fight is over! 
Gooney is still unconscious! I know, I know . . . how can you tell? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if we can get a few words with the winner. George? George! What did 
you think of the fight, George?" 
</P>
<P>
"What fight?" 
</P>
<P>
"When did you know you had him, George?" 
</P>
<P>
"December." 
</P>
<P>
"What was the toughest part of the fight, George?" 
</P>
<P>
"Fighting with these reading glasses on." 
</P>
<P>
"What's next for you, George?" 
</P>
<P>
"Room service." 
</P>
<P>
"Any truth to the rumor that you're turning senile, George?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I deny that." 
</P>
<P>
"By the way, what do you think of Mike Tyson, George?"

Bryan's out. Terry's in. And the Washington Capitals go their Murray-Murray 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see if I've got this brother-for-brother swap straight. Bryan-the-elder 
has one of the 15 best records of any coach in the history of big-time 
puck-swatting. He has gotten a once-inept franchise routinely into the National 
Hockey League playoffs, though never into May. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals are oh-for-the-'90s and on an eight-game losing streak, but the 
town has not gone after Murray's scalp with any passion. Most of us were 
perfectly content with owner Abe Pollin's explanation for the slide: 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose two players, your number one and number two defensemen (Rod 
Langway and Scott Stevens), and then Neil Sheehy, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Pollin said that five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Was he pleased with Bryan? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure." 
</P>
<P>
Not pleased-as-punch happy, of course, but seemingly satisfied to the point of 
allowing loyal and competent Bryan the courtesy of another run at the playoffs. 
Same with most fans. 
</P>
<P>
Bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Pollin learned from his main hockey man, General Manager 
David Poile, that Bryan is a lousier coach than he or nearly anyone else had 
imagined. He agreed with Poile that a firing was in order. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourth worst record in the NHL" slightly more than halfway through the season, 
Poile said toward the beginning a recitation of Bryan's bumbling. Twentieth "of 
21 in power plays. Not one of our players is near the top of the leaders in 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength used to be our goals-against average. ... There is not one thing 
we can hang our hat on. There is not one player in the eight-game losing streak 
that I can say has come to the front, that has shown any improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Poile was not being mean. His manner while announcing Bryan's firing included 
enough staggered breathing to indicate the break with Bryan after seven full 
seasons had been difficult. Poile even offered the best perspective on the only 
productive coach the team has known: 
</P>
<P>
Bryan "has contributed as much ... as any other person or player who has played 
or been a part of this organization. In '82-83, his first full season, the 
mandate was to make the playoffs or this franchise would be history. Bryan 
Murray was the coach who led the Caps into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
So Bryan saved the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
That and 343 regular-season victories have earned him an enormous amount of 
goodwill. Still, after each of the last few seasons, the Capitals failed to 
fulfill expectations in the playoffs, and Bryan's future as coach was 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have been surprised had Poile fired Bryan after the team lost to 
the fourth-place Flyers in the first round of the playoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of bouncing Bryan, Poile gave him a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than seven months into that contract, Poile uses his hook. In 
Washington, all that matters is the playoffs. When the wounded mend, the team 
could begin a serious surge. Even failing to repeat as Patrick Division 
champions might not be all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the New Jersey Devils finished fourth in the division two years ago and 
skated into the conference finals during the playoffs; the Flyers repeated that 
feat last season. Chicago was another fourth-place team that got hot late and 
made the conference finals in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
As to how even one injury can cripple a team, Pollin need look no further than 
his own basketball team. With John Williams, the Bullets are a playoff team 
capable of finishing proudly on the plus side of .500; without Williams, the 
Bullets are scarcely better than the NBA's expansion babies. 
</P>
<P>
Should Wes Unseld be fired? 
</P>
<P>
No way. 
</P>
<P>
One devoted Capitals fan the other day said he hoped Bryan would allow the 
injured players to move into the lineup slowly, so as to give the youngsters a 
chance at the maximum experience and put as many fresh legs as possible onto 
the playoff ice. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Poile, patience was the prevailing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"You deal a lot with your instincts," Poile said. "What you see. How you feel. 
How you think people are improving or not improving. And you make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Poile talked about his hardest conversation in sport: "When you trade a player, 
at least he has a contract and he's going to another team. What I was saying to 
Bryan Murray was: 'You no longer have a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Bryan must go, why is Terry-the-untested the correct replacement? All Terry 
did, it seems here, was learn close to everything about the sport from Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a substantive difference in the two people," Poile said. "In manner 
and coaching philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Terry has been terrific in two seasons with the minor-league Skipjacks, 
successful with younger players against teams stocked with veterans who ought 
to be superior at that level. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the strange switch might be called the Quadruple Bang Theory. 
Most changes jump-start most teams for a while; by that time, Terry will have 
had time to implement his style; then Langway and the others will be at full 
strength; shortly, the playoff adrenaline will kick in. 
</P>
<P>
Poile admitted "tremendous risk" with his move and added: "This is not an exact 
science. At the end of the year, you could be writing it was the wrong 
decision. It was my decision ... a tough call." 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, Poile talked about timing, about the time and place having to be 
right to bring a new coach behind the bench. Poile now has put his neck on the 
line as never before, it says here, because timing on this one was terrible.

MURRAY WINS OPENER

<P>
Terry Murray, possibly the first coach to get the job after his brother was 
fired, had a winning debut as coach of the Washington Capitals Tuesday night at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Pivonka had two goals and an assist in a wild, 9-6 victory over the New 
Jersey Devils that ended the Capitals' eight-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Murray, Terry's brother, was fired Monday and Terry, who coached the 
Capitals' farm team at Baltimore, said he thought long and hard before 
accepting the job. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 minutes of his first NHL coaching job, Murray might have been having 
second thoughts. The Devils, leading the Patrick Division, needed that much 
time to jump ahead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
But the Capitals, their defense hampered by the loss of injured stars Scott 
Stevens and Rod Langway, bounced back with six consecutive goals and won going 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling, I feel great," Murray said. "But there were some anxious 
moments early." 
</P>
<P>
Pivonka scored at 11:23 of the second period to give the Capitals the lead and 
late in the period, he scored on a power play to make it 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 3, Vancouver 0 -- At Uniondale, N.Y., a magnificent 
performance by goaltender Glenn Healy kept the Islanders on their hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
The former King stopped 51 shots for his second shutout and the Islanders 
reached the .500 mark with their seventh victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Wood's goal at 4:24 of the second period was all Healy needed to run the 
Islanders' record in the last 20 games to 16-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 3 -- At Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux kept his scoring 
streak alive and the Penguins kept the Flyers' winless streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux assisted on Rob Brown's second goal of the game in the second period to 
get a point in his 34th consecutive game. The Flyers are 0-5-3 in their last 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey had two assists to reach 900 points, only the fourth defenseman to 
get that many. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, St. Louis 2 -- Brian McLellan scored twice at St. Louis, including 
the first of two power-play goals to open the game, and the Flames won handily. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Mike Vernon stopped 20 shots to win his third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 8, Winnipeg 6 -- Veteran center Claude Voiselle had a goal and three 
assists at Winnipeg to lead the Nordiques back from an early 2-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Lafleur had his 12th goal and an assist for the Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Edmonton 4 -- Steve Yzerman scored twice at Edmonton as the Red 
Wings fought back from an early 3-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to the last place team in the Norris Division dropped the Oilers into 
a tie for first place in the Smythe Division with Calgary. DAN HAFNER

LITTLE HOOVER REPORT DRAWS IRE OF CRIBBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The executive secretary of the California Fish and Game Commission takes 
exception to the Little Hoover Commission's conclusions that it is unresponsive 
to environmental issues, unqualified to deal with them and a rubber stamp for 
the Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
And, says Harold C. Cribbs, he was not indifferent to public interest, but 
"tried and tried" to return The Times' phone requests for a response to the 
Little Hoover Commission report two weeks ago. Cribbs said his assistant, Bob 
Treanor, was refused copies of the report in advance. The Little Hoover 
Commission confirmed the latter point, contrary to its previous statements. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the Fish and Game Commission -- composed of five hunters and 
fishermen -- was too lopsided to be effective in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs: "There's no question that we have moved into the environmental arena. 
We've had doctors in environmental science on the commission. What you (also) 
need is someone who is knowledgeable about fish and wildlife issues and people 
who are proven decision makers." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Cribbs said, if someone doesn't like the gubernatorial appointees, he 
can complain to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps if they have additional background in environmental science, and the 
Legislature has the ability to set some guidelines," he said. "The Senate Rules 
Committee has the ability to deny the confirmation to a candidate if he doesn't 
qualify, and the Senate as a whole votes on those individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs said one problem is that "the general public doesn't know the difference 
between the commission and the department. There's a specific code section that 
mandates that none of the commissioners has any administrative authority over 
the department. None. So I can't pick up the phone and tell anybody to do 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission is given the authority to set broad policy for the department, 
and we've adopted a multitude of policies that were motivated by the 
commission, not the department." 
</P>
<P>
As examples, Cribbs cited new coherent and uniform fishing regulations, a 
statewide policy mandating a no-net loss of wetlands, a directive to the 
department to put its acquisition and ownership of land in order and an 
emergency designation of the upper Sacramento River winter-run king salmon as 
endangered last year. 
</P>
<P>
In that instance, the commission over-rode the department's attitude that some 
observers linked to political influences. 
</P>
<P>
The LHC acknowledged that in seeking a balance between people's needs and those 
of the environment, the commission, lacking proper scientific evidence, often 
is in a position of being "damned if you do and damned if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
The LHC also rapped Fish and Game for poor public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs said: "The commission has assumed a low-profile approach to things. 
We're going to be much more up-front with what the commission is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Each monthly commission meeting has a "public forum" on the agenda. Public 
workshops are being scheduled on subjects of major concern. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't catching the giant yellowfin tuna often associated with the area, 
but those traveling well into Mexican waters aboard San Diego's long-range 
fleet are returning with impressive catches nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The Polaris Supreme, with 16 anglers aboard, returned from a 16-day, 1,100-mile 
trip to the Revillagigedo Islands late last week with 248 yellowfin tuna -- the 
largest an 89-pounder caught by Barry Knowles of Palos Verdes -- and scores of 
wahoo and grouper. The Revillagigedos have produced yellowfin well in excess of 
300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Several days earlier, the Searcher and Royal Star returned from nine-day trips 
to the Alijos Rocks -- about 700 miles south of San Diego -- with better 
success. The 22 passengers aboard the Searcher brought back 476 yellowfin tuna, 
92 yellowtail, 20 dorado, 11 wahoo, four grouper and three sargo. Paul Beckett 
of Los Alamitos caught the largest -- a 104-pound yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Star had similar success, catching fewer yellowfin but more 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's H&amp;M Landing has delayed until Jan. 24 its long-range natural 
history expeditions -- aboard the Spirit of Adventure and Deluxe -- to the 
winter breeding grounds of the California gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
The 500-mile trips to Baja California's San Ignacio and Scammon lagoons 
generally take eight or nine days -- an 11-day trip includes travel into the 
Sea of Cortez to La Paz -- and feature lectures by marine biologist Ted Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin are the main attraction for fishermen off Cabo San Lucas, where 
skippers are reporting an average of 1 1/2 billfish a day. 
</P>
<P>
According to Darrell Primrose of Tortuga Sportfishing, most stripers are being 
caught in the blue water near the Jaime bank. Dorado are plentiful, averaging 
between 15 and 25 pounds, and an occasional blue marlin is among the catches. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Cape region, the unseasonable dorado bite has slowed somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rafael Martinez of the Hotel SPA Buenavista, the winds that 
generally blow consistently during the winter have yet to do so, and 
light-tackle fishermen working near-shore areas are producing fair catches of 
small roosterfish and sierra mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Sportfishing Assn. of California will have a benefit banquet for its 
founder, Bill Nott Feb. 1 at the Balboa Pavilion in Newport Beach. Tickets are 
$75. Nott, who turned 73 Monday, is recovering at his Dominguez Hills home from 
a respiratory illness. Details: (619) 226-6455. . . . Jeff Gredvig of 
Roseville, Calif., has claimed a record catch for northern California's Clear 
Lake. Gredvig's Florida largemouth weighed 15.35 pounds, topping the record of 
13.96 set in 1982. It was 29 1/2 inches long, with a girth of 22 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
The 34th Southern California Boat Show is scheduled Feb. 2-11 at the L.A. 
Convention Center. Hours: 2-10 p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturdays, 11 
a.m.-7 p.m. Sundays. Admission $6 for adults, $3 for children 6-12.

RESERVOIRS WELCOME RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain has slowed the fishing at many Southland reservoirs, but their operators 
aren't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
The water level at Santa Barbara County's Lake Cachuma, for example, is 66 feet 
below normal -- the lowest it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
"It's survival," a lake spokesman said of the need for rain, adding that 
without a significant amount this year the spawning of fish could be severely 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby Lake Casitas, in Ventura County, is reportedly down 39 feet from its 
historical level. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Fishing extremely poor. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass scattered, biting best off points from 30-40 feet. 
Frozen anchovies, live shad and spoons working. Largemouth bass slow, best 
chance upriver near ledges at 20-30 feet. Catfish on bottom biting on 
anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass hitting surface to sub-surface lures in Lake 
Mohave. Most in the six-pound range. Charles Crate, Bullhead City, 22-pound 
striper. Several limits of pan-size trout coming from river, taken on most 
baits. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina becoming active at Red Hill and Niland Marina 
-- occasional nine-fish limits of fish between 8-10 pounds. Thin Fin lures 
working best. Croaker picking up throughout sea, best off banks in afternoons. 
Tilapia slow. Channel catfish averaging five pounds biting in All-American 
Canal on chicken livers and mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout providing most action, biting at 30 feet. Largemouth bass 
favoring chartreuse or green plastic worms. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass picking up, biting on crank baits and plastic 
worms. Catfish at 50 feet, biting on mackerel. Tom Leckey, Ojai, 12-pound 
catfish. Trout slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass active in marina after trout plant. Allan Cole, 
Lancaster, 24- and 9-pound stripers. Ed Kurhiana, Monterey Park, 30-pound 
striper. Several limits of trout. Occasional trout to three pounds. Largemouth 
bass averaging three pounds biting mainly at Lost Mine Cove. Catfish best at 
Bear Trap area. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Largemouth bass picking up. James Wells, Arleta, 6 1/4-pound bass. 
Dayton Grant, North Hollywood, 4 1/2-pound bass. Several near-limits of trout, 
most being taken by trollers -- using frog needlefish lures -- and bait 
fishermen using Berkley Power Bait. Catfish fair at dam. Mackerel best bet. 
</P>
<P>
CASTAIC LAKE -- Largemouth bass bite fair between storms. Dave Keyes, Woodland 
Hills, 10 1/2-pound bass, caught on lower lake. Paul Johnson, Hermosa Beach, 6 
1/2- and 5-pound bass. Paul Shepherd, 11 3/4-pound bass. Brian Porter, Castaic, 
8 3/4-pound bass. Trout fair. Catfish slow. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout most active at West Shore, Sierra Cove and Trout Island. 
Trollers using rainbow and shad-colored Rapalas. Fernando Gutierrez, San Dimas, 
five trout, 21 pounds. Scott Hughs, Van Nuys, 5 3/4-pound trout. Crappie biting 
at West Shore area. Don Ware, Newport Beach, 10 crappie, five pounds. Ron 
Couch, Westminster, 11 1/2-pound sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
PERRIS LAKE -- Fishing pressure light. Spotted and largemouth bass fairly 
active in deep water, biting primarily on nightcrawlers and Hopkins lures. Some 
limits of pan-sized trout, coming mostly from launch ramp area.

New Jersey investor and horse racing enthusiast John Aglialoro reached an 
agreement that could make him the new owner of Canterbury Downs, a race track 
in Shakopee, about 40 miles southwest near Minneapolis. For $4 million to $5 
million, Aglialoro agreed to purchase the stock owned by Canterbury president 
Brooks Fields Jr., Fields' nephew Brooks Hauser and Santa Anita Realty 
Enterprises Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Aglialoro faces purchasing the track's $43-million mortgage and must obtain an 
operating license from the Minnesota Racing Commission, his attorney, John 
Broeker, said. 
</P>
<P>
Without an infusion of cash, Canterbury won't operate this year, Royce 
McKinley, chairman and chief executive officer of Santa Anita Enterprises, and 
Hauser said. The track has lost $70 million since it was built in 1985, helping 
to drive the real estate firm shared by Hauser and Fields into U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court, where it is being reorganized under Chapter 11. McKinley said Santa 
Anita Enterprises has lost $17.5 million on the venture and would get 45% of 
Aglialoro's purchase price.

Soccer referee Toros Kibritjian, who was fired by the Major Indoor Soccer 
League in 1986 after the publication of his controversial autobiography, has 
been reinstated and is officiating in the MISL this season. 
</P>
<P>
Kibritjian, who has more than 30 years of international experience, was 
terminated in the middle of a one-year contract because MISL officials said 
passages in his book indicated he was not objective and impartial. Kibritjian, 
who is from Monterey Park, sued in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was settled late last year. Terms of the settlement were not 
disclosed, but in addition to his reinstatement, Kibritjian received a monetary 
award.

With 4:48 left in the first half, Kentucky's Jeff Brassow and LSU's Chris 
Jackson were each assessed a foul by officials after a pushing match. Teammates 
separated the two players, but not before Pitino and Brown stormed to the 
scorers' table to register their gripes with officials and exchange words.

She scheduled the nuptials for last Saturday, when the team would be in the 
midst of a nine-day break. 
</P>
<P>
Paine figured that would give her time to complete preparations for the 
ceremony and have a few days for a brief honeymoon trip with her groom, Phil 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
The plan appeared solid until the start of the season, when she learned that 
first-year Coach Gary Schwartz had added a game against Midland Lutheran of 
Nebraska on Jan. 14 in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
So much for planning. 
</P>
<P>
When she learned about the game, Paine, 21, admitted she was more than a little 
disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Schwartz) was trying to hamper my plans," she said. "But we 
smoothed things out and everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
Except that Paine, the all-time leading scorer and rebounder for the Coyotes, 
would have to play the day after the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
"(Her fiance) wasn't happy about it when I first told him," she said. "It was 
like, 'No, you're not going to the game!' But then he said it was OK with him. 
He likes to watch me play, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Added Walsh: "I want them to make the playoffs, and this (was) kind of a big 
game for them. So I think it was kind of important for her to be there." 
</P>
<P>
The couple reached an agreement with Schwartz that they would keep their 
wedding date as scheduled, spend their wedding night in the mountain ski resort 
town of Idyllwild, return for the game Sunday night, then go back to Idyllwild 
after the game for another day or two. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said the coach also made another concession. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a deal with the coach that I get to go to the playoffs with the team if 
we get there," he said. "That was my part of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Paine says that Walsh is understanding about athletes having to make sacrifices 
because he is an outside hitter for the volleyball team at San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
But Paine added that if she had been pressed to choose between the wedding and 
the game, she would have chosen the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at every game since I've been there," Paine said. "I didn't want to 
miss a game but if it came down to choosing between the game and my husband, it 
would have been my husband." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Paine, everything went off without a snag. 
</P>
<P>
She was married during a ceremony Saturday in the chapel at March Air Force 
Base in Riverside, where her father had served as an Air Force sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
As planned, the couple stayed overnight in Idyllwild and returned for the game 
despite snowy road conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Paine had her best game of the season. She made her first five shots, scored 27 
points and grabbed 14 rebounds in leading San Bernardino to a 75-70 victory 
over Midland Lutheran, a perennial power in the National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics. The victory was team's ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The San Bernardino athletic department also did its part to make the game 
memorable for Paine. 
</P>
<P>
With a little help from a nearby restaurant, the athletic department 
distributed wedding cake to everyone at the game. The sheet cake was decorated 
to resemble a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
The department also offered congratulations to Paine in an insert in the game 
program. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing missing was a lengthy honeymoon, but the couple plans to 
spend spring break in Hawaii to make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Paine is content to focus on basketball. With her team's 10-3 
record, the NCAA Division III playoffs appear within reach. 
</P>
<P>
With the understanding that her husband will be there as well, that is just 
fine with Paine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting off the year right and hopefully, come March, we'll get another 
added bonus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening weekend of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's 
basketball season last week, Cal State Northridge provided a perfect example of 
how nonconference records can sometimes be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors began CCAA play with the second-worst record in the eight-team 
conference at 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Matadors were scheduled to open the conference season against Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo and then play Cal State Bakersfield -- two of the 
favorites for the title. San Luis Obispo began conference play at 10-3 and 
Bakersfield at 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
Northridge beat San Luis Obispo, 90-78, and Bakersfield, 61-58. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the Matadors tied for first place in the CCAA at 2-0 with defending 
conference champion UC Riverside after the first week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team, which reached the NCAA Division II 
final last season, was No. 4 in the first Division II rankings last week. The 
Broncos, 13-3, are listed behind top-ranked and defending champion Delta State 
of Mississippi, Central Missouri State and North Dakota. All of Pomona's losses 
have been to Division I schools. . . . Westmont of Santa Barbara is ranked No. 
19 in the latest National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics men's basketball 
poll. The Warriors, a perennial District 3 power, are off to one of their best 
starts in recent seasons at 14-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly San Luis Obispo women's track team, which won the NCAA Division II 
title last season, will be well represented at the 31st annual Sunkist 
Invitational indoor track meet Friday night at the L.A. Sports Arena. 
All-American distance runner Teena Colebrook will compete in the women's 
880-yard run along with teammate Aeron Arlin, and Aina Albanese is entered in 
the 440. The only other College Division athlete from the Southland competing 
is Dan Ratjes of Point Loma Nazarene in the men's high jump. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles has chosen Dan Silver, an assistant with the University 
of Oregon women's tennis team last season, as its men's tennis coach. Silver, 
24, replaces Ed Charles, who resigned last month. Cal State L.A. finished 3-17 
overall and 0-10 in the CCAA last year. . . . Kicker Greg Maw of Cal Lutheran's 
football team has been named to the College Division Academic All-American 
second team by the College Sports Information Directors of America. Maw, who 
led the Kingsmen with six field goals and 34 points as a senior, is a political 
science major and has a 3.83 grade-point average.

THE PREPS: DAMEWORTH GOES THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High School began his running career at age 12, 
the first race he ran was 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for Dameworth, he found he was not a sprinter. His performance in 
that race was so disheartening that he decided to begin training as a distance 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
"I only started running distance because I wasn't successful at the shorter 
distances," Dameworth said. "I started to like running distance only because I 
seemed to do better." 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly seven years later, Dameworth has made the most of that decision. He 
has become one of the best prep distance runners in the nation. His 
credentials: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last month, he concluded an undefeated senior cross-country season with a 
victory in the Kinney nationals in San Diego, after having finished fourth as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He finished eighth in the 1986 West regional, becoming the first freshman 
male ever to qualify for the Kinney national meet, where he finished 19th. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has won three consecutive state Division I cross-country titles, most 
recently in a state-record 14 minutes 45 seconds in November. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He finished second in the state championship 3,200-meter run as a junior 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Dameworth will take his running talents inside when he competes 
in the first national high school mile run at the Sunkist Invitational track 
meet at the Sports Arena. "Running indoors is fun, but running on boards is 
tough on your calves," Dameworth said, who last year finished third in the 
Sunkist two-mile. "I am hoping that I will do well this year, but you cannot 
really get ready because we do not have any access to any indoor tracks." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, who will also run the mile at the Millrose Games in New York next 
month, will face top competition Friday, running against Louie Quintana of 
Arroyo Grande, who finished third in the Kinney national; Martin Keino of Fork 
Union, Va., whose father is former Olympic medalist Kip Keino; and Danny Jordan 
of Venice, who won the City mile championship last June. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Kinney meet Dec. 9, Dameworth took two weeks off, which 
included a ski trip, before he began training again. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed some time off after cross-country season," said Dameworth, whose 
stepfather, Bill Duley, is Agoura's track coach. "It was more mental than 
physical because my body is in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
During his base training period, Dameworth runs nearly 100 miles a week, and, 
once the outdoor season begins, he averages 80 miles a week and sometimes uses 
Agoura dual meets as workout days. 
</P>
<P>
"Those occasions when I run three or four races in a meet are like training 
days for me," Dameworth said. "I use those days to work on my speed." 
</P>
<P>
With his distance-running success, Dameworth is considered a top prospect for 
many college track programs, and he is looking forward to running his favorite 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not run the steeplechase in high school, but that is what I plan to 
specialize running in college," Dameworth said, adding that he is considering 
Arizona, Oregon, Colorado and UC Irvine. "I will also continue to run 
cross-country, but I can't wait until I can run the steeplechase full-time." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Dyck, boys' basketball coach at Beverly Hills High, was not happy to see 
the recent rain. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, Beverly Hills was scheduled to play host to Bay League rival 
Hawthorne in the "Swim Gym," which has a retractable floor over the swimming 
pool. The roof is under repair and leaked in the rain, causing the game to be 
moved to Hawthorne, where the Cougars handed Beverly Hills its first league 
loss, 69-58. 
</P>
<P>
"This really hurts when you have a home game moved because of rain," Dyck said. 
"We now have only a tarp ceiling over the gym and whenever it rains, it leaks 
on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Dyck and Hawthorne Coach Richard Wells agreed to move their varsity game to 
Hawthorne in order to play on a regulation size floor after the freshman and 
junior varsity games were played in Beverly Hills' smaller girls' gym after 
rain had begun to drenched the "Swim Gym." 
</P>
<P>
"Hawthorne's team got back on the bus and we got in some vans and we all drove 
back to Hawthorne to play," Dyck said. "We were expecting a big crowd at home, 
but ended up playing in front of about 50 to 75 people in their gym." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, whose football team had to forfeit key games last fall due to a 
school district teachers' strike, will travel to play Palos Verdes today and is 
scheduled to play host to Torrance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only hope that it doesn't rain for Friday," Dyck said. "I used to like 
it when it rained, but now I shudder at the thought." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Piper Hahn, who led Mira Costa to the girls' Division I state volleyball 
championship, was named national co-player of the year by Volleyball Monthly 
magazine. She shares the honor with Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark. Hahn, a 
second-team All-American last season, was joined by three other local players 
on this year's All-American team. They are Kristal Attwood of Mira Costa, 
Danielle Everett of Newport Beach Corona del Mar and Taikeasha Williams of 
Bellflower.

SUPERSONICS ARE PLEASED WITH THEIR NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KAHN, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new look has been pleasing to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Sedale Threatt might never be mistaken for Dale Ellis, but the Seattle 
SuperSonics (18-16) enter their 7:30 game Wednesday night against the Los 
Angeles Lakers (26-8) in the Forum with a three-game winning streak. And 
certainly Threatt, who has averaged 15.3 points during this recent run, has 
played a vital role. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural move for him," Sonics assistant K.C. Jones said. "Sedale 
doesn't have the same range as Dale, but he can shoot off picks, and he's a 
natural two-guard, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Threatt, always the selfless, quiet one when it comes to discussing his role on 
the team, won't bite. Ellis, expected to be out for a couple of months with 
three broken ribs following a car accident Friday morning, is perhaps his best 
friend on the team and misses him terribly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a role," Threatt said after starting the past two games in Ellis' 
absence. "Now I'm the backup filling in for Dale. I can't replace Dale. Nobody 
can. But our defense and offense have opened up. When we pressure more, we're 
able to get out on the break and find open shots." 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the difference. With Ellis in the lineup, the Sonics work 
around getting him his shots on offense. With Threatt playing instead, they 
lose the individual explosiveness of Ellis, but their defensive pressure is a 
lot more consistent and the ballhandling far more effective. Whether it's Avery 
Johnson, Dana Barros, or Nate McMillan next to Threatt, there is better 
quickness, dribbling and passing than with Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are moving the ball a lot better," Sonics point guard Nate McMillan said. 
"When Dale is in there, he's a great shooter, so we concentrate on getting him 
shots. Now we don't have the great long-range shooter, so we have to work the 
ball better to get our shots. Therefore, we have a guy (Threatt) who can shoot 
and penetrate with the ball a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"With Sedale and Avery in there at the same time in the starting lineup, it's 
like having two guys who can do the 40 in 4.2 on the floor who can handle the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' accident has forced the Sonics to do what Coach Bernie Bickerstaff has 
been pleading for them to do all season -- concentrate on defense and ball 
movement -- so that the easy shots will come more often. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach has wanted us to move the ball more," McMillan said. "Now we're focused. 
We know we have to do those extra things to make up for Dale not being here. 
Now it's working." 
</P>
<P>
SuperSonic Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis was released from Seattle's Harborview Medical Center Tuesday 
afternoon after a CAT scan disclosed no tears in his lower trunk as initially 
feared. So he went home. The King County Prosecutor Wednesday is expected to 
issue charges against Ellis for reckless driving and perhaps driving under the 
influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Magic Johnson to be playing a lot of forward tonight for the Lakers. 
When Larry Drew moves in at point guard, Johnson has been effective at the 
small forward. . . . The Sonics have not won in the Forum since the final game 
of the 1986-87 season.

ARGENTINA TO PLAY MEXICO AT COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Argentina, the defending World Cup soccer champion which has yet to win after 
two exhibition games this year, will play Mexico tonight at 8 in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players who will represent Argentina in this summer's World Cup in 
Italy are expected to be with the team tonight, a notable exception being Diego 
Maradona, star of the championship team. He is under contract to Napoli in the 
Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina earlier lost to Monaco, 2-0, and played to a scoreless tie with 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico is expected to field a young team as it builds for the future. It was 
disqualified from this year's World Cup for using over-age players in a junior 
tournament.

Gillette Wins Round in Court: U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan denied a Justice 
Department request to immediately freeze Gillette Co.'s planned acquisition of 
part of Wilkinson Sword's international razor blade business. The judge refused 
to issue a temporary restraining order, saying Gillette has stated that no 
action would be taken without a 10-day advance notice to the government. The 
acquisition is being challenged on anti-competitive grounds, alleging a 
violation of the Clayton Act.

HUGHES LOST MORE WORKERS THAN EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

Hughes Aircraft, which announced plans last year to eliminate 6,000 jobs in an 
effort to save money, instead finished 1989 with its employment rolls down by a 
net of 9,300 workers, it was learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The job losses constituted the largest cutback by a defense contractor since 
Rockwell International in 1986 began laying off 23,600 B-1 bomber workers, 
12,600 of them in Southern California. Unlike the Rockwell cutback, the Hughes 
layoffs came in the midst of a declining market, in which Northrop, Lockheed 
and General Dynamics were also laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 9,300 jobs lost at Hughes are considered by the company to be 
permanent reductions. But about 2,100 of the jobs may have been lost only 
temporarily, company spokesman Ray Silvius said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the company has found itself short of workers in some 
instances and is advertising for new workers or bringing in temporary workers 
through "job shop" agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of really good people left," said one missile engineer at the firm's 
Canoga Park facility. "It makes it harder for the rest of us. . . . Hughes had 
to do something because its costs were too high." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of Hughes six major operating groups, stretching from the San 
Fernando Valley to Orange County, were affected. 
</P>
<P>
The company did not have available a breakdown of the layoffs by location. But 
it is believed that the firm's Fullerton division was one of the hardest hit, 
with an estimated loss of 1,500 jobs. The satellite and communications 
operation in El Segundo was reportedly among the least affected. The reductions 
during 1989 lowered Hughes' employment to 67,000, down 15,000 from its peak in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The job reductions were made through a combination of layoffs, retirements and 
terminations. Some workers left voluntarily with special benefits and others 
were put out involuntarily -- with or without special benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes had said it would eliminate the 6,000 jobs under a program called the 
"organizational transition plan." But Silvius said 1,200 more workers than 
planned were cut through the plan, because more employees accepted the 
voluntary package than Hughes expected. 
</P>
<P>
The company figured that to get the 6,000 terminations, it would have to offer 
7,500 to 8,000 workers the package, a company official said last year. The 
inducements included payment of one week's salary for each year of service. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people felt their jobs were flaky, and they didn't want to stick 
around for later layoffs," one manager said. "So, they took the offer if they 
could get it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, normal turnover occurred outside the organization transition 
plan and those workers were not all replaced. Hughes never publicly announced 
that it would reduce employment outside the organization transition plan. 
</P>
<P>
The company now says that 3,500 workers who were not covered by the 
organizational transition plan left the company. The firm hired 1,400 workers 
during the year, for a net reduction of 2,100, bringing the total to 9,300. 
</P>
<P>
Silvius said the reductions through attrition were "normal" and the company was 
advertising for workers to fill some, if not all, of those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no burst of hiring going on," he said. "We are advertising, and in 
some cases hiring workers." Silvius added that the current level of workers 
from job shops "is pretty normal." 
</P>
<P>
Some engineers and scientists around the company took a skeptical view of the 
situation, saying they couldn't understand why the company paid workers to quit 
only a few months ago and now must advertise to hire new workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very depressing situation," one engineer said.

RECOVERY EFFORT BEGINS AT CAMPEAU CORP. RETAIL UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: EX-TREASURY SECRETARY G. WILLIAM MILLER, THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE 
OPERATION, IS IN CHARGE OF THE FIRM'S COMEBACK TRY.

<P>
Sinking into bankruptcy is awful. But for Campeau Corp.'s department store 
operations, trying to make a comeback could be a miserable experience, too. 
</P>
<P>
A common quick-fix approach for an ailing company, a speedy sale of assets to 
raise cash, would be very difficult for Campeau for, among other factors, legal 
and tax reasons. At the same time, the 1990s are expected to breed brutal 
competition among department stores -- a terrible time for companies that are 
trying to turn around their finances. 
</P>
<P>
"Cash-rich competitors want your turf," explained Sanford C. Sigoloff, a 
retailing turnaround specialist who led Wickes Cos. out of bankruptcy in 1985. 
He now heads L. J. Hooker Corp., the bankrupt parent of Bonwit Teller. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's recovery effort began Tuesday as the Toronto-based concern gave its 
U.S. retailing holding company a new name and officially announced the 
appointment of its chairman. As reported in Monday's Times, former Treasury 
Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairman G. William Miller is the new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
He will head Federated Stores Inc., which previously was known as Campeau Corp. 
(U.S.). The holding company is now the parent of Southern California's Ralphs 
supermarket chain along with the two department store divisions that filed for 
bankruptcy court protection on Monday, Federated Department Stores and Allied 
Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's retailing empire, which was crushed by $7.7 billion in debt, faces 
immediate problems as well as long-term ones. For starters, customers who are 
concerned by news of the bankruptcy might take their business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The stores, meanwhile, may dig themselves into a deeper hole by missing out on 
some of the best spring merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied have won bank approval for $700 million in fresh 
financing, freeing the stores to buy new goods. But the recent uncertainty 
concerning the divisions' financial status allowed their competitors to get a 
head start in placing orders. 
</P>
<P>
The Campeau stores also need to smooth over hard feelings among some angry 
apparel manufacturers and other suppliers. Ostensibly to keep suppliers happy, 
the chains last Wednesday mailed out payments for due bills. 
</P>
<P>
The snag, however, was that many of the checks weren't processed by the 
Federated and Allied banks before early Monday, when the Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
cases were filed. Consequently, a lot of money will be held up, perhaps for a 
long time, in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"If the checks don't clear, they (the stores are going to have a serious 
credibility problem," said Estelle Rose, controller of Nicole Miller Inc., 
which sells women's apparel to Campeau's Bloomingdale's and Burdines stores. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the situation said company officials wanted to hold off on 
the Chapter 11 filing to give all the checks time to clear. But, the source 
said, Campeau officials grew worried that if they didn't hurry, a creditor 
might file a suit that would put the stores into a more worrisome involuntary 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Over the longer haul, Federated and Allied will face a litany of industrywide 
problems. Many analysts expect a shakeout among department stores in coming 
years as a result of increasing competition from discounters and specialists 
such as Toys R Us and Home Club. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the problem of too many stores, demographic trends are expected to 
work against retailers. As baby boomers get older, analysts say, they will be 
tighter with their dollars and look even harder for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosperous chains such as Nordstrom, Dillard Department Stores and 
May Department Stores are expected to use their financial muscle to squeeze 
struggling competitors. 
</P>
<P>
There's little chance that matters could be helped swiftly by selling the 
comparatively well-off Ralphs supermarkets chain or the nine Federated and 
Allied department store groups. Campeau released estimates prepared by its 
investment bankers at Merrill Lynch last week indicating that Federated and 
Allied's debts exceed their assets. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, selling some of the chains individually would produce hefty bills 
for capital gains taxes. Financial specialists estimated that Ralphs' parent 
would have to pay $270 million in extra taxes if it unloaded the chain. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, selling off prosperous businesses can be self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the chains) are good, you need them to bring in cash. If they're not 
good, you don't get the prices you need," Sigoloff said. "You're damned if you 
do, and damned if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
Sigoloff said that tedious bankruptcy proceedings can scuttle potential deals 
by presenting delays, typically, of at least three months and sometimes much 
longer. A case in point: Campeau's efforts to sell Bloomingdale's have faltered 
because of concerns about bankruptcy at a time when fewer and fewer firms are 
interested in buying retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Federated and Allied stores may be hard-pressed to hold on to 
top-flight executives as bankruptcy proceedings -- estimated to take anywhere 
from 18 months to several years -- drag on. "It's tough to keep an organization 
together when there's doubt about its long-term viability," said Philip 
Johnson, senior vice president of human resources at Chicago-based Marshall 
Field department stores. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the U.S. retailing organization is assembling a new top 
management team. Along with appointing Miller on Monday, the company confirmed 
that Ronald W. Tysoe, currently president of Campeau's Canadian and U.S. 
operations, will stay on as president of the new U.S. holding company. 
</P>
<P>
It also announced that James M. Zimmerman will remain president and chief 
operating officer of Federated and Allied. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, however, John W. Burden III, chairman and chief executive of 
Federated and Allied, will quit effective Jan. 31 "to pursue other interests." 
The company has offered his job to Neiman-Marcus' head, Allen Questrom, but has 
not received an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the issues that the new top executives will face are clearly 
defined. Given the size of the bankruptcy case -- it's by far the biggest ever 
in U.S. retailing and, by one measure, the fourth largest in the nation's 
history -- there are plenty of imponderables. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson of Marshall Field: "We're in unchartered territory."

GE Plans Engine Project: General Electric announced the development of a more 
powerful family of jet engines for bigger airliners still on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly $2-billion cost would be shared with three foreign companies. GE 
said SNECMA of France would share 25% of the development cost and risk of the 
first new family of commercial jet engines in 20 years. West Germany's MTU has 
also signed a tentative memorandum of understanding, and GE also hopes to reach 
agreement with an unidentified Japanese company.

T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury sold $7.6 billion of new three-month bills at 
an average discount rate of 7.68%, up from 7.57% last week. 
</P>
<P>
Another $7.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 7.54%, up from 7.44% last week. The rates were the highest since Dec. 
26. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.94% 
for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,805.90 and 7.95% for 
a six-month bill selling for $9,618.80. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than their 
face value.

Soviet rock fans will soon be hearing more from the likes of Billy Joel, Phil 
Collins, Janet Jackson and other American favorites. The producers of two pop 
music "countdown" radio programs that compete in the United States said Tuesday 
that they will begin broadcasting shows in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"USA Top 20," produced and distributed by Westwood One, will debut Feb. 9 and 
air twice a month. It will be hosted by Stuart Detmer, a 26-year-old Chicago 
native who lives in Moscow and speaks Russian fluently, said Norman J. Pattiz, 
Westwood One chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be produced in Los Angeles then delivered to the Soviet Union 
for translation and airing over government-owned Gosteleradio. Commercial 
sponsorship will also be available on the show, with foreign companies running 
ads during the 90-minute program, Pattiz said. Westwood One will produce two 
other music programs, "America on Record" and "American Musical Classics," to 
air in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"American Top 40," produced by ABC Radio and hosted by radio and television 
personality Shadoe Stevens, will also be heard on Gosteleradio. The debut date 
is not yet set but will be sometime before April 1, according to Tom Rounds, 
president of Radio Express, which handles the program's international 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been in continuous weekly production since 1970 in the United 
States and is currently heard in 70 countries, Rounds said. No further details 
about the Soviet version were available.

SINGAPORE AIR ORDERS JETS WORTH $8.6 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: BOEING WILL GET THE LION'S SHARE OF THE ORDERS, BUT THE AIRLINE ALSO 
ORDERED MD-11S FROM MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
</P>

<P>
Singapore Airlines, a growing carrier known for its high-quality service, said 
Tuesday that it has ordered $8.6 billion worth of new aircraft from Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Though Boeing stands to get the biggest share of Singapore's business, the 
order is significant for McDonnell Douglas because it gains a new customer. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's current fleet consists of aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus 
Industrie, the European consortium. But Singapore said it decided to order 
McDonnell Douglas MD-11s because Boeing's long-range jets were too large for 
certain flights between Singapore and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier also pointed out that its international marketing partners, 
Swissair and Delta Air Lines, have placed large orders for the MD-11. The 
airlines believe that there are competitive advantages to using the same type 
of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore said it ordered five MD-11s and took options on 15 more, worth $3.1 
billion if all options are exercised. The order makes Singapore Air the 
third-largest customer for the MD-11, behind American Airlines and Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore Air said it ordered 15 Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets, and took options on 
15 others. The Boeing order, including options, is worth $5.5 billion, 
according to Singapore Air. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore said that aircraft from both manufacturers would be delivered between 
1994 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
If Singapore takes delivery of all the aircraft, the size of its 39-plane fleet 
would more than double to 89. However, Singapore said the new aircraft would be 
used to replace older models as well as for expansion, primarily in Europe and 
Asia. The airline currently offers limited service to the United States, flying 
only to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Air, said the airline plans to seek 
authority to land in either Chicago, New York or Washington. He said the 
carrier also plans to begin transatlantic service, possibly later this year, 
with a flight between Toronto and Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Though Singapore's presence in the United States is minimal, it is well known 
to international travelers for its high level of service, and it consistently 
ranks among the world's top airlines on customer surveys. Its flight 
attendants, for example, address passengers by name. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore said it would deploy some of the new aircraft on its European 
flights, although it didn't specify which destinations. It said that the 
smaller MD-11 was better suited for new service, where the size of the 
potential market is uncertain.

and a county sheriff because we're the county seat." 
</P>
<P>
"And we vote on everything," added his wife, Patricia Aburdene. "We even voted 
on whether to have a Grateful Dead concert here." 
</P>
<P>
Telluride (population 1,200), a travel-poster ski resort tucked in a box canyon 
and ringed by the snow-capped San Juan range of the Rockies, is home to 
Naisbitt and Aburdene. It's where they vote and pay taxes and seek rest and 
recreation from the demanding global lecture schedule that has consumed them 
since 1982, when the phenomenal successes of Naisbitt's first book, 
"Megatrends," transformed their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The book, described by its author as a "road map for the 1980s," was aimed at 
helping people understand change. In it, Naisbitt -- a former business 
executive who had been concentrating on social trend analysis -- examined 10 
major patterns that he saw as shaping the future of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Megatrends," which jumped immediately to the bestseller list and stayed there 
for two years, sold more than 8 million copies (at last count) around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
It also catapulted the energetic Naisbitt to prominence as a speaker who could 
captivate and energize business groups with his positive assessment of the 
future. (The last line of the book: "My God, what a fantastic time to be 
alive!" indicates the extent of the author's unbridled optimism, an attitude 
that prompted a New York Times reviewer to dismiss the book as "the literary 
equivalent of a good after-dinner speech.") 
</P>
<P>
With Aburdene, who contributed to "Megatrends," Naisbitt in 1985 wrote 
"Re-inventing the Corporation," also a bestseller. The book, described by one 
reviewer as "the bible of change in the workplace," described how the 
traditional business structure -- hierarchical and authoritarian -- is being 
replaced by humanistic businesses that emphasize personal growth. The authors 
not only described some of the new corporate prototypes but also provided a 
"how to" checklist for the business person seeking such change. 
</P>
<P>
The book launched Naisbitt and Aburdene, who both have business backgrounds (he 
had held executive positions at IBM and Eastman Kodak; she was a 
reporter-researcher at Forbes Magazine when they met), into a collaborative 
career. 
</P>
<P>
They get more than 100 requests a year for personal appearances, of which they 
accept about 60%. 
</P>
<P>
And now they have written their second broad-brush trend book, "Megatrends 
2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990s," which contains such upbeat forecasts 
as a booming global economy, a renaissance for the arts and, most significantly 
in terms of a forecast that has been overtaken by events, the emergence of 
free-market socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Published by William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc., the book has just been delivered to 
the nation's bookstores and the authors launched a two-week, 16-city 
promotional blitz this week. 
</P>
<P>
Explained their editor, Adrian Zackheim, vice president of William Murrow: "We 
look on this as a very, very major event. It's the first major trend book in 
eight years and a lot has happened. Suddenly the year 2000 is close." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the major event, Naisbitt and Aburdene spent the first few 
days of the new decade basking in the serenity of Telluride and polishing their 
act. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given enough lectures together now that we've learned how to alternate 
as speakers," volunteers Aburdene, "but we still have to be careful that we 
aren't talking on top of each other." 
</P>
<P>
Their ability to share a speaking platform is unusual, says Bill Leigh, whose 
Princeton, N.J., bureau handles their engagements. "I've never seen another 
program out there where this joint-play really works. It's very much their 
relationship -- something they have evolved together." 
</P>
<P>
Their close relationship is evident in public and private. Although they have 
spent most of their lives on the East Coast, Naisbitt, 61, and Aburdene, 42, 
wearing heavy sweaters, pants and snow boots, share the healthy, outdoorsy look 
and vigorous enthusiasm for new ideas that befits their sparkling mountain 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
The two writers, who live together, work together, travel together and lecture 
together seem almost symbiotic -- a model of mutuality. 
</P>
<P>
"The world's leading trend forecasters," as the book jacket describes them, 
sat, one recent afternoon, in the soaring living room of their showpiece house 
(designed by Theodore Brown of San Francisco), a multilevel chalet of pine logs 
and bleached adobe that perches above town like a minor castle. Its pitched 
eaves, octagonal windows, balconies and bridges reflect the storybook quality 
of Telluride; the high ceilings, tiled floors and Indian art complement the 
artistry of its Western-Southwestern setting. 
</P>
<P>
A book-lined loft study overlooks comfortable chairs and couches in the 
double-height living room. A fax machine clicks in the background. Like its 
owners, the high-tech/high-touch home seems perfectly suited to its 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In an extended conversation over coffee, the two talked about their success, 
their critics, their personal relationships and the importance of Telluride in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Although they have been categorized variously as prophets, gurus and futurists, 
they dismissed those labels in typical back-and-forth style: 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt: "I don't like the word futurist. We've been more comfortable with 
social forecasters." 
</P>
<P>
Aburdene: "We (actually) describe the present. All we do is notice what is 
happening. It's the world around us we are reflecting in these trends." 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt: "We're just a little ahead of the parade. Most people have a kind of 
intuitive sense of change going on, but don't have the luxury of looking into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Aburdene: "We've done tons of research -- we read everything and distill every 
bit of information. 'Megatrends 2000' has 50 pages of end notes. I have a 
master's degree in library and information science and I am devoted to being 
somewhat precise." 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt: "Our approach has to do with the notion that change starts locally, 
from the bottom up. That's why newspapers are so important to us: No one else 
comes closer to chronicling what is happening. We don't watch TV for 
information: network news is disinformation. There is a mind-set (there) that 
only bad news is news. We're much more optimistic than that." 
</P>
<P>
Aburdene: "Optimism empowers people. That thing that bothers me most about 
negativity -- the idea that the world is going to hell in a hand basket -- is 
that it provides the perfect excuse for not doing anything. It's a cop-out." 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated Naisbitt-Aburdene optimism is not universally admired. Their 
facility for synthesizing and simplifying often fails to impress intellectuals, 
critical of sweeping statements ("To put it mildly, they are exaggerations," 
said National Journal writer Neal Peirce) and accessible prose. 
</P>
<P>
And on this particular day, Time magazine had just appeared with a full-page 
review of "Megatrends 2000" that, in part, described the authors as "21st 
Century ecstatics," whose "relentlessly affirmative message" about the coming 
millennium had the "adolescent confidence" of a high school valedictory 
address. 
</P>
<P>
Although the review was particularly harsh, the reaction was philosophical. "I 
was angry at first, but I believe in a free press," said Naisbitt in response. 
"We have no control over that and we have to attend to our own integrity. 
That's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
And, he pointed out, the new book is already finding its admirers. Naisbitt 
produced a copy of a promotional newspaper ad, being prepared by the publisher, 
with all-out enthusiastic comments from 23 of the country's prominent thinkers 
-- from Norman Lear to Malcolm Forbes. Peter Sellars, director of the Los 
Angeles Festival, calls the book "A decathlon of optimism . . . makes you want 
to get up in the morning, go out there, and ride that wave!" 
</P>
<P>
"This is my favorite quote," noted Naisbitt, reading: "It's a nice antidote to 
Time magazine." 
</P>
<P>
And while emphasizing the importance of a favorable book launch in a world 
brimming with new publications, he added, "In the long run, the book will come 
to stand for however useful it is for people." 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt and Aburdene say that making information useful is their ongoing goal. 
In service of that objective, statistics, definitions and aphorisms leap from 
the pages of their book: 
</P>
<P>
"Running out of information is not a problem, but drowning in it is." . . . "It 
is not by chance that the United States has 188 Nobel prize-winners and Japan 
has five" . . . "For the last two decades, U. S. women have taken two-thirds of 
the millions of new jobs created in the information era . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Megatrends 2000" looks at the 1990s and sees a new world as the Cold War ends, 
the arms race slows, and, in an emerging era of globalization, the arts 
flourish; there is an international call to environmentalism, and communist 
countries are experimenting with the market mechanisms of capitalism. These are 
all empowering messages, they believe, for a society dominated by media 
doomsayers. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not the criticism it might seem. "The people reporting the bad news 
are doing their job," they write. "We respect them for it. Our mission is a 
different one. Because the problems of the world get so much attention, we, for 
the most part, point out information and circumstances that describe the world 
trends leading to opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult not to be optimistic in the sparkling sanctuary of 
Telluride's bright blue sky and awesome mountains. Said Naisbitt: "The more we 
travel, the more vision of this world keeps us going." 
</P>
<P>
The resort was a special place even before they moved there, said Naisbitt, who 
had been coming to the Telluride Film Festival for years. (Their marriage in 
1981 was the second for both). 
</P>
<P>
"The first trip Patricia and I took together was here, for the film festival," 
he recalled. "I didn't tell her where we were going, just said to take jeans 
and dress warmly." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until 1984 that they chose it as their home. Living in 
Washington, caught up in the frenzy over the success of "Megatrends," lecturing 
full time and working on their second book, they had even decided to skip the 
film festival that year because their schedules had become so hectic. 
</P>
<P>
That's when they decided to take their own advice about acknowledging change 
and transforming their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to a restaurant and started talking about how we were living," 
Naisbitt said. "We realized we were ricocheting around the world -- we had a 
house in Washington, but we didn't know our neighbors. That's when we blew the 
whistle on all that travel. We decided to come here and buy a house. So many 
people move here, seeking community. It's like an extended family." 
</P>
<P>
They now spend the summers and winters in Telluride, and travel the 
lecture-consultant-seminar circuits in spring and fall. This quarter-on, 
quarter-off pace suits them nicely and reflects their own advice in 
"Megatrends" that "we must learn to balance the material wonders of technology 
with the spiritual demands of our human nature." 
</P>
<P>
"There was another crucial element in our decision to live here," added 
Aburdene. "It's the extent to which, in the post-industrial age of 
communications, people don't have to show up at a workplace. I work closely 
with an assistant who lives in Washington. The number of people who do this -- 
who are no longer location bound -- is just exploding." 
</P>
<P>
In Telluride, they say, they are engaged in the life of the town, serving on 
civic boards, sponsoring a party for the film festival, and, creating the 
Telluride Institute -- a nonprofit foundation that has sponsored five Ideas 
Festivals and that Aburdene calls a "participatory, nonelitist version of the 
Aspen Institute." 
</P>
<P>
Festival themes have ranged from global issues (with guests from the Soviet 
Union) to the nitty-gritty problem of affordable housing in Telluride's booming 
real estate market. "We're devoted to the idea that if you work in Telluride, 
you should be able to live here," said Aburdene. "So we brought in an expert 
who has studied the specific problem of ski resort housing, and gave us an 
encyclopedia of alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
But civic activities (which in Telluride can include skiing) have to 
accommodate the work schedule that their lives focus on: Trend forecasting is 
almost a spiritual calling. 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt was quoted in 1983 as saying, "I'm so convinced that our great hope 
for world peace is the global economy that I would really like to devote a lot 
of time to that and take some responsibility for it." That continues to be a 
driving philosophy for the two. They've been described as New Agers, stemming 
from such interests as global unity, corporate networking and the importance of 
achieving human potential, but they sidestep the label. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to live with a label that can be minimized, or trivialized," 
commented Aburdene. "When we met in 1978, there were a lot of interesting and 
exciting programs about human potential -- that's the basis of the New Age 
movement and John and I both believe in the possibilities of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
"But since 1981 we've been doing our own thing." 
</P>
<P>
That means an intensely personal focus on their research and writing, and a 
rigorous work schedule. Both are early risers who find mornings to be "sacred 
and uninterruptable" for reading and writing, although Naisbitt also "gets on 
the phone in the mornings, when we're not writing a book." 
</P>
<P>
Although their house includes a large dormitory for guests (Naisbitt has five 
grown children by his previous marriage to Noel Senior), except for holidays 
and a "few weeks of the year for company," they are alone, said Aburdene. 
"That's why we can have our office overlooking the living room here, instead of 
all walled up." 
</P>
<P>
They take an hour's walk (up the hill to the mine and back) every day, said 
Aburdene. "I find that walking together, out in this beautiful country, is a 
very congenial thing. We have interesting talks. You can stick a pen in your 
pocket, and, if you get an idea, you can stop and jot things down. You can't do 
that when you're running." 
</P>
<P>
Naisbitt, who has been a runner for 20 years, also has a treadmill in the 
downstairs dormitory. "In the winter I get on that and watch all the cable 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
Research is a constant part of their routine, he added. "We continue to follow 
what we've been writing about: We keep an update file for the soft-cover 
edition of the book." 
</P>
<P>
They do not agree with criticism that their "trends" are simplistic. "I have 
years and years of experience in trying to figure out what's going on in the 
world," said Naisbitt, who declared bankruptcy at one point in his career. "It 
takes a lot of failures and time, until you really get almost a sixth sense, or 
hone the senses you have." 
</P>
<P>
"Megatrends" grew out of Naisbitt's successful Trend Report, a prestigious 
newsletter that, for an annual subscription fee of $15,000, informed corporate 
clients about cutting-edge developments. 
</P>
<P>
Although he no longer owns the newsletter, Naisbitt still uses the techniques 
that made it successful. Their approach to work, says his wife, is "very 
simplistic. At first, we just sort through ideas. We take a dozen newspapers 
and hundreds of magazines, and John is there with his scissors every day, 
clipping. We also have a researcher who works in Washington and can follow up 
on any subject we need. We also get information from a network of people around 
the world. John tends to be intuitive; he will give information an initial scan 
and make a preliminary hypothesis. In a way, I take over and say can this be 
proved or not proved." 
</P>
<P>
But their work is not just a matter of shuffling information around, she added: 
"The other dimension we bring to this is travel and getting to know things 
firsthand." 
</P>
<P>
They view the coming decade with something like exuberance. "On the threshold 
of the millennium, long the symbol of humanity's golden age," their book 
concludes, "we possess the tools and the capacity to build utopia here and 
now." 
</P>
<P>
And if that sounds naive, in the face of drug wars and AIDS and poverty and the 
ozone layer, they resolutely see the glass as half full. 
</P>
<P>
Said Naisbitt: "The history of civilization is that things get better. That's 
the larger picture. People ask how we can be optimistic when a fourth of the 
world's population is in poverty. Well, 100 years ago, 95% of the world's 
population was in poverty. If what's happening in Eastern Europe today -- with 
people going from tyranny to democracy -- can't be viewed optimistically, what 
the hell can?" 
</P>
<P>
MEGATRENDS REVISITED 
</P>
<P>
In "Megatrends," published in 1982, John Naisbitt examined the 10 major 
patterns of change he said America could expect in the 1980s. Eight years 
later, he insists "these shifts are continuing pretty much on schedule." At 
home in Telluride recently, he examined his trends list and offered these 
observations: 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are shifting from an industrial society to one based on the 
creation and distribution of information. 
</P>
<P>
 THE UPDATE -- "While the proportion of blue-collar jobs decreased from 19.5% 
to 15.5% in the last decade, more than 90% of the new jobs being created today 
are in the information sector." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are moving from a national economy to a world economy. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "World trade has been increasing at 10% a year, and the upcoming 
emergence of single-market Europe is but a step to a single-market world." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are moving in the dual directions of high-tech, high-touch, 
matching each new technology with a compensatory human response. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "Despite the explosion in sales of high-tech VCRs, people didn't 
abandon the 'high-touch' experience of going to movies. The industry peaked 
with a record-breaking summer of 1989 at the box office." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are restructuring from a society run by short-term 
considerations and rewards in favor of dealing with things in much longer-term 
time frames. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "The tremendous concentration of economic and job growth in the 
1980s has been in small entrepreneurial companies with long-range vision, 
versus the Fortune 500 companies who are short-term driven and whose total 
labor force has been shrinking throughout the decade." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are shifting from centralization to decentralization in 
politics, business and culture. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "In our offices we have moved from utilization of mainframe 
computers to the widespread presence of the personal computer." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are shifting from institutional help to more self-reliance in 
many aspects of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "The number of self-help groups continues to grow, as men and 
women call upon their own resources in everything from the burgeoning ACA 
(Adult Children of Alcoholics) meetings to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and 
neighborhood watch groups." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are moving from representative democracy to participatory 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "The proliferation of citizen-inspired ballot initiatives and 
referendums on Election Day has been a phenomenon of the 1980s, with California 
in the lead." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are giving up our dependence on hierarchical structures in 
favor of informal networks. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "Networking was the buzzword of the 1980s, affixed to formal and 
informal groups of all kinds, as well as newsletter and computer groups that 
connected members on a horizontal level." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- We are moving from the industrial cities of the Northeast to the 
South and West. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "Between 1980 and 1988, in a Sun Belt explosion, Florida's 
population gained by 26.6%, Texas by 18.4% and California by 19.6%." 
</P>
<P>
THE TREND -- From a narrow either-or society, with a limited range of personal 
choices, we are exploding into a multiple-option society. 
</P>
<P>
THE UPDATE -- "Only a few years ago, television viewers had their choice of 
three major (and similar) networks. Today cable television watchers can choose 
from up to 80 channels of programming." 
</P>
<P>
MEGATRENDS 2000 
</P>
<P>
In "Megatrends 2000," John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene present these trends 
as major influences in our lives during the 1990s: 
</P>
<P>
* The Global Economic Boom of the 1990s: Contrary to popular doomsaying 
scenarios, we are bound for a period of unprecedented prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
* A Renaissance in the Arts: The arts will permeate mass culture as never 
before, replacing sports as our dominant leisure activity. 
</P>
<P>
* The Emergence of Free-Market Socialism: From the turmoil in the Eastern Bloc 
will spring a new and unprecedented economic and political ideology. 
</P>
<P>
* Global Life Styles and Cultural Nationalism: Big Macs and Esprit sportswear 
may be ubiquitous, but the growing similarity of life styles around the world 
is producing a backlash against uniformity and a desire to assert the 
uniqueness of one's culture and language. 
</P>
<P>
* The Privatization of the Welfare State: The burning social question of the 
'90s will be how to help the poor without bankrupting the national treasuries. 
From the Third World to the West, the shift from government control to private 
enterprise is the first step. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rise of the Pacific Rim: The focus of the world economy will shift from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific, with America's West Coast states as well 
positioned as Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
* The Decade of Women in Leadership: Well-suited to the new humanistic 
requirements of institutional leadership, women have reached a critical mass in 
the white-collar professions and will attain leadership positions in 
significant numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Age of Biology: Biotechnology will provoke the greatest ethical and 
intellectual debates since the days of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
* Religious Revival of the Third Millennium: Although the ways of seeking it 
will differ, from fundamentalism to New Age, spirituality will play an 
ever-expanding role as the millennium approaches. 
</P>
<P>
* Triumph of the Individual: A new regard for individual achievement and 
integrity will underlie global changes. Telecommunications will liberate 
creative and self-employed people to live and work in quality-of-life locales.

BARGAINS LURK AMONG USED ELECTRONIC ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you don't have to have the latest electronics -- stereos, tape decks, VCRs, 
CD players or turntables -- there are bargains to be found on used and 
reconditioned equipment. You can find suitable older models taken as trade-ins 
at electronics stores, offered by private sellers in classified advertisements 
or sold at swap meets and flea markets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But, generally, "the market for used TVs, VCRs and stereo equipment has dropped 
off because pricing of new equipment is so inexpensive today," observed Mark 
Rosenker of the Electronic Industries Assn., a Washington-based trade group of 
American electronics manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices are very competitive, too," he added, explaining that a good, new 
videocassette recorder can be purchased for less than $200 or a 20-inch 
television set with remote for $239-$249. 
</P>
<P>
"And none of it breaks," he said. "The average life of a TV is 12 to 14 years. 
I've got one that's 20 years old. I just move it from room to room. . . . If I 
were going to get rid of it, I wouldn't sell it. I'd just give it away to the 
Salvation Army or to some kid who needed one." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Schuster, manager of Rogersound Labs in Santa Monica, agreed the market 
for secondhand electronics goods is soft but added: "Electronics are changing 
so fast that within a year the thing you bought is almost outdated. We almost 
never take anything in trade any more. If we do, we would feel obligated to 
have a warranty of 90 days on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who come in here want the latest, the biggest, best, brightest and 
sharpest TV or whatever," he said. "And all the new things have full warranties 
on them. But if they're looking for used items, probably the best place to get 
used equipment is through (classified ads from) private parties." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shannon Henry, an owner of Henry Radio in West Los Angeles, observed that, 
"there's a lot of action in used ham-radio equipment but almost none in video. 
Nobody wants a used TV. In audio, it's mostly amps (amplifiers)." 
</P>
<P>
Some stores taking trade-ins sell the equipment "as is" after ensuring it 
works; others have technicians check it, replace bad parts, then sell it with a 
90-day warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Radio has started taking used equipment on consignment for customers, 
said Jerry Sharp, who runs the stereo department and who observed "we find (the 
process) more advantageous. . . . That way our money isn't tied up in the 
equipment, as it would be on a trade-in. We sell it for the customer; he gets 
75% and we get 25% commission for selling it." 
</P>
<P>
He displayed a consignment Bang &amp; Olufsen turntable. "In 1985, I sold it to 
a guy from Lake Elsinore. He paid close to $1,000 for it. It is one of the 
first turntables with a straight-line tracking arm. We're selling it for $257 
now; the customer will get 75% of that. That's better than he would get on a 
trade-in." 
</P>
<P>
He also cited the example of a Bang &amp; Olufsen 2400 receiver. It cost $550 
new in 1983 but now sells for $78 on consignment; it would be worth $30 to $40 
on trade-in. Henry Radio doesn't warranty consignment items but does offer an 
unconditional 10-day return. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp and others knowledgeable about electronics warn would-be buyers to be 
careful with used speakers, because "they deteriorate mechanically. The foam 
(inside the speaker cone) disintegrates in smog." 
</P>
<P>
For consumers selling items, it pays to know their equipment and what it's 
worth, the experts added. "Some of it is like having a vintage T-Bird or a 
Stutz Bearcat, because it's gone up so much in value," Sharp said. "A 70-watt 
Marantz Model 9 power amp with tubes made from 1964-68 was $390 new. Now it's 
worth $1,792." (That was a 1989 quote; the newest expert quote is $8,500.) 
</P>
<P>
Buyers and sellers can check equipment prices in books published by Orion 
Research Corp., of Durango, Colo. Orion's listings are the electronic industry 
equivalent of the Kelley Blue Books for cars; they're updated and published 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Most audio-video stores keep Orion books on hand, as do most pawnshops, said 
George Grosjean, a stereo salesman for Radio Lab in Glendale. And most of those 
dealers will allow courteous customers to consult the Orion volumes -- seven in 
all, covering a range of products, including electronic equipment, cameras and 
personal computers, said Roger Rohrs, Orion books' publisher. He added that the 
books are available at public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Grosjean urged used-equipment buyers to test gear to ensure it works: "Be wary. 
If you can't try it out at a swap meet or garage sale, don't buy it. Even then, 
you're taking a chance on how long it will work. A used CD player, for example, 
is worth only $25. If it's bad, it costs about $200 to fix it. Even if you plug 
it in, and test it, and listen to it, it may be all right for awhile. Some may 
not act up for an hour or two." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest demand in the used-electronics market seems to be in "the 
high-end, better stuff," said Randy Cooley of Santa Monica's Audio Research, 
which takes equipment in trade. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get something a few years old for half price or less, depending on the 
product," he said. "Somebody just traded in an Audio Research SP8 pre-amp 
that's three years old and cost $1,995 new. It will sell for $995." 
</P>
<P>
When his store takes trade-ins, "we have technicians look at them and make sure 
they meet the (product) specifications or better, but we don't warranty them," 
Cooley said. But "if something happens to it within a short period of time, 
we'll fix it for free because we don't want the customer to feel bad about 
buying it." 
</P>
<P>
And what about that stuff sold at swap meets or flea markets? It's often 
equipment that the industry calls "B stock," repackaged, reconditioned goods 
returned to a manufacturer by stores because it is faulty or broken. 
Manufacturers recondition it, add a short warranty and sell it to swap meet 
dealers, who, in turn, offer it at reduced prices to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should switch their new purchases on and off frequently, shortly 
after purchase, as the equipment then is most likely to fail -- early on and 
while still under the shortened warranty, Rohrs said. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably 99.9% of (electronic) merchandise sold at swap meets is new or 
factory repacks," said Detective Mark Myrdahl, who heads the pawnshop-swap meet 
section of the Los Angeles Police Department burglary-auto theft division. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's 'Buyer beware,' " Myrdahl added. "If there's a driver's license 
number etched on it, it's stolen. Or if you see an ad in the paper that implies 
the item is stolen, don't buy it. Because if you have knowledge that it's 
stolen, and you buy it, that's a crime." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that a used product isn't "hot," Myrdahl urged buyers and sellers to 
go to their local LAPD division and ask the desk officer to check the item's 
make, model and serial number through a state computer registry of serial 
numbers of stolen property.

<P>
FASHION: THE SIBLINGS BEHIND EPILADY HAIR REMOVER HAVE A VERY PROFITABLE EYE 
FOR GADGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their new Santa Monica headquarters are already too small. The telephones in 
their Virginia Beach, Va., customer service center ring to the tune of 2,000 
calls per day. In less than three years, they have launched 20 personal care 
products and talk about a 1989 sales figure of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the entrepreneurial Epiladies (a.k.a. the Krok sisters): Sharon, Arlene 
and Loren. Young (31, 29, 24 respectively), smart and born to hate the hair on 
their legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we've always been obsessed with that problem," explains Sharon Krok 
Feuer. Their solution has made them the talk of the cosmetics and the 
personal-care industries. They are the women behind the Epilady, a hand-held 
device with a rotating coil that pulls hair out at the root. Also to their 
credit are EpiSauna, EpiSsage, EpiPed and EpiSmile, to name a few of the 
goodies from their EPI (Essential Personal Items) Products company. 
</P>
<P>
Their success depends in part on their eye for good gadgets. Instead of 
inventing every one, they frequently acquire the distribution rights for 
existing items, or they buy products outright from the inventor. Epilady, for 
example, was developed by two Israeli engineers and is manufactured on a 
kibbutz in Upper Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after Loren and their father, Solly Krok, discovered the 
revolutionary hair remover, the family owned distribution rights in the United 
States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. (Solly Krok is a South African 
philanthropist and multimillionaire, who with his twin brother owns Twin-Med, 
an international pharmaceutical company. One by one, the sisters moved to the 
United States.) 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ross, EPI Products' chief financial officer and a longtime friend of 
the Krok family, says there has always been a game plan: "To become a major 
personal care company in the United States. With that decision, we built up a 
dental and a skin-care division to go with our hair-care division. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally unusual. You can count on one hand those who have gone from 
nothing to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in divine providence," Ross says, "but we enforce that by being an 
extremely philanthropic organization. We give large amounts to charities. It's 
our belief that what goes around comes around. That's a lesson taught to us by 
Mr. Krok. He taught us to give." 
</P>
<P>
The business does seem to have grown by divine providence. Epilady was launched 
in the United States in 1987 at Bloomingdale's Manhattan store. Fifteen hundred 
units were sold during the first week, even though it took extensive 
advertising, in-store videos and a toll-free number to get consumers past the 
fear of discomfort associated with the product. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, in what seems to be the story of their lives, the Krok 
sisters came across their next product. 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, the Epilady was featured in a newspaper Sunday magazine 
story about new grooming devices that also included a photograph of a portable 
mini-facial sauna from Miami Beach, Fla.-based Bernhard Industries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beautiful shot" recalls Arlene. "We said, 'We love this product. 
Maybe we should contact the owner.' " They did, "he was dying to sell," and 
three months later EpiSauna was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, Loren stumbled upon what would become EpiSmile (a four-ounce, 
$12 cylinder of toothpaste sold only in department stores). It was invented by 
Dr. Irwin Smigel -- the New York dentist who pioneered a tooth-bonding 
technique -- specifically as a whitener for bonded teeth. Later, he says, he 
found that it removed stains on all teeth. Loren used it and raved to her 
sisters about what was then Super Smile; they tried it and wanted it for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
Smigel says at least three giant corporations were after his secret formula. 
But it went to the Krok sisters "because I really trusted them. Super Smile was 
very difficult to make. Either a chemist or I had to be there to check on every 
batch. I was always afraid one of the big companies would dilute the formula to 
make it easier to produce. The EPI people were willing to put in writing there 
would be no changes without my permission. That was good enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a heady string of successes, the Krok sisters, by all accounts, remain 
down to earth. Employees, suppliers and retailers say they are accessible and 
receptive to new ideas. The EpiHeat pack, for example, was suggested by a 
supervisor in the Virginia Beach Service Center, and Smigel says he has just 
sold EPI Products the rights to another formula. 
</P>
<P>
Within the industry, about the worst anyone has said of the Krok women is that 
they drive a hard bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene, for example, got MEPRO, the Israeli manufacturer of Epilady, to agree 
she would get "a million-dollar yacht" if EPI Products sold more than 3 million 
of the hair removers in the United States during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, EPI Products had filled the quota, and MEPRO came through 
with a 68-foot sailboat and a full-time captain. 
</P>
<P>
"The three sisters have the reputation of being very tough, but I don't think 
that's bad," says Suzanne Grayson, a marketing consultant in Santa Barbara and 
author of the Grayson Report, an industry newsletter. "Considering what they 
have accomplished . . . they have done an incredible job. 
</P>
<P>
"They have managed to find a niche in which they are all alone. They have no 
real competition, which is certainly not true in the rest of the cosmetics 
industry. And they've done a very good marketing job; they've been able to be 
mass and class at the same time, which is a neat trick." 
</P>
<P>
The company is structured so that Arlene, a wiry, hip-dressing workaholic, is 
the president in charge of operations. Soft-spoken Sharon, married and the 
mother of two young children, is executive vice president in charge of 
advertising and marketing. Loren, the most glamorous of the three, lives in New 
York, where she handles East Coast operations and telephone sales. She is the 
co-producer of the current Broadway revival of "Meet Me in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
"When we started, we decided it would be a family business where we could all 
work together," says Bernice Krok Ungar, 26, the fourth of the Epiladies and 
the last of the seven Krok children to settle in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very close and very close in age," she says, adding that two 
brothers, Ian and Martin, have their own businesses in Irvine. A third brother, 
Paul, is a student at USC and might be the first male in the family to work at 
EPI Products. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's not busy at school he sits in on meetings," says Bernice, whose own 
project is working on a new line of "back to nature" cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
"To stay in business, you have to come out with more and more products," says 
Arlene, who is always on the lookout for such modern marvels as EpiBrush -- a 
self-cleaning hairbrush that was knocking around the Far East with no takers 
until the Kroks came along -- and a cellulite fighter called EpiSsage, which 
they discovered at a Danish trade show. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more products come rolling out, and competition increases (among 
the most recent, Remington Products introduced Smooth and Silky, a hair-removal 
device similar to the Epilady), the Kroks have expanded their strategy. They 
now offer "ultra" versions of their original products to department stores and 
have put less deluxe models into stores at the K mart level. They also rely on 
extremely slick, massive advertising campaigns (currently budgeted at $42 
million). 
</P>
<P>
The clout behind EPI is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to turn down anything EPI comes out with in the future," says 
Doreen Erickson, J.C. Penney cosmetics buyer for beauty accessories. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is, if they came out with an EPI handbag, we'd be watching to 
see what they would be doing with it."

$7-MILLION 'ANNIE' SEQUEL ORPHANED ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow, you're only a day away." 
</P>
<P>
That's the chorus that charmed audiences left the original version of the 
musical "Annie" singing for the seven years the hit show played on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
But now the producers of the $7-million sequel to that successful show, "Annie 
2," are praying that there will be a tomorrow someday for the production that 
closes its Washington D.C., run Saturday in the wake of negative reviews and an 
equally negative response from the public. 
</P>
<P>
The producers have announced that "Annie 2" will not be coming to Broadway to 
begin previews Feb. 5 and open on March 1 as planned. Instead they said they 
plan to bring a revival of the original Tony Award-winning musical which opened 
on Broadway on April 21, 1977 and ran for 2,377 performances until it closed on 
Jan 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The show's spokesman, David Powers, said here that director Martin Charnin 
expects to use much of the same cast in the revival that he used in "Annie 2," 
as well as the same scenery and costumes. "Annie 2" features Dorothy Loudon as 
Miss Hannigan, Harve Presnell in the role of Daddy Warbucks and 11-year-old 
Danielle Findley in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Annie 2," that sequel which will have 36 performances before its 
Washington run ends Saturday, will be presented in a revised version sometime 
over the summer at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., where 
"Annie" originated in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Annie 2" features a score by Martin Charnin and Charles Strouse and a book by 
Thomas Meehan, the same team that mounted the original show, but as soon as the 
critics saw the sequel, the production at the Opera House at Washington's 
Kennedy Center, appeared to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post theater critic, David Richards, wrote that " 'Annie' was a 
musical to take to your heart but you'll want to take a paddle to 'Annie 2'." 
Richards called the plot "preposterous" and the score "dull" even after seeing 
a streamlined version which had shed 30 minutes from what had been a 
three-and-a-half-hour running time. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, as co-producers Roger S. Berlind and Lewis Allen met around 
the clock, calculating how the show could be transformed in Washington, Berlind 
declined to discuss the production's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright and Dramatists Guild president Peter Stone, a Broadway veteran, also 
chose not to give his opinions on the musical's flaws, but Stone did say that 
"Annie 2" producers had asked him, director Tommy Tune and director/producer 
Mike Nichols to see the show and offer their advice. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the three had gone to Washington "as friends" of the "Annie 2" team 
and that they had discussed the production, but he said none of them would be 
involved in creating a new version of the sequel. Stone said any opinion he 
might offer publicly would only add to the misfortune of the show's producers 
who he said were "fighting for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
"Annie 2's" producers are quick to point out that the original "Annie" did not 
become a hit without its own struggle for survival. That show almost closed at 
the Goodspeed Opera House in 1976, but it was turned around by Mike Nichols, 
who signed on as a producer at Martin Charnin's invitation. Nichols helped 
oversee changes in the book, characters, sets and choreography as well as the 
addition of several songs. 
</P>
<P>
The highly advertised and now orphaned "Annie 2," which had accumulated $3.6 
million in advance sales, had forced the successful musical "Me and My Girl" 
out of the Marquis Theater on Broadway. That show closed on Jan. 1 to make way 
for the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
The show's producers were reportedly considering the Marquis as an ideal 
location for the revival of "Annie," but the Nederlander Organization, which 
owns the theater, is said to have sensed that the sequel's abrupt closing might 
well haunt the revival and rejected that maneuver. Nederlander has insisted 
that the lease at the Marquis was for "Annie 2," not for "Annie." 
</P>
<P>
A press spokesman of the show said that the lease is still under negotiation. 
If an agreement is reached to put the revival of "Annie" in the Marquis, the 
spokesman said, rehearsals for the revival could begin as soon as Feb. 5, the 
day "Annie 2" was to start its New York previews. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for "Annie 2" also confirmed reports that co-producer Berlind had 
offered to return 25%-30% of the production's costs to its investors in the 
hope that the investors would then put that money into the revival of "Annie."

NBC PRESIDENT PLEADS FOR EASING OF CONSTRAINTS

With more than 8,000 people in attendance, 1990's convention of the National 
Assn. of Television Programming Executives is the largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
And along with more people, this annual marketplace for syndicated television 
programs also features more participants from foreign countries -- including 
China and the Soviet Union -- and a new crop of cable companies eager to 
negotiate their share of the syndicated shows that traditionally have been 
gobbled up by network affiliates and independent TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
With such a varied, international and competitive guest list, it seemed only 
fitting that NBC President Robert C. Wright, this year's keynote speaker, would 
kick off the event Tuesday with his oft-voiced complaint about the government's 
financial interest rulings, which prevent the networks from striking up 
production and ownership deals with cable companies and other TV networks at 
home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Wright described the Big Three networks as being locked behind "a Berlin Wall" 
denying them the right of free trade. He protested that, while cable can draw 
revenues from its subscribers and advertisers, and syndicators and producers 
may hawk their wares to virtually anyone, the networks remain locked into 
gleaning profits from only one source: advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Wright noted that Japan's Sony Corp.'s recent acquisition of Columbia Pictures 
and Lorimar's purchase by Time Warner have already broken down traditional 
barriers between the movie, music and television industries. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he hopes the 1990s will bring "the financial techniques of motion 
picture film making into television," allowing creative deal-making between 
producers and networks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no boundaries anymore, except for the wall of network regulations 
surrounding three companies -- ABC, CBS and NBC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright added that, if current regulations cause the networks to lose their 
competitive edge in acquiring the best entertainment shows, their news, sports 
and local programming could suffer as well. "If we stumble, and if we fall, all 
of you are going to feel the impact," he said.

HOT GUNS: No one wants to talk about it officially but Orange County Sheriff's 
Department investigators are scrambling to explain an embarrassing theft of 
guns from their training academy in Orange. . . . The heist, which one source 
said involved as many as 42 handguns, took place about two weeks ago. Then, 
sources say, at least four people were arrested in a bust that took place 
shortly before midnight last Wednesday at the Best Western Stardust Motel in 
Anaheim. . . . Next step: sheriff's officials meet this morning to determine 
the status of the investigation. Steve Emmons and Mark I. Pinsky

Donald J. Dustin's hands keep time with his words as he recalls the glory days 
more than a decade ago when he could field 200 musicians for the halftime show 
at a high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
Dustin, who resigned as band director at Locke High School in 1983 to become 
director of performing arts for the Los Angeles Unified School District, then 
settles back in his chair to deliver his dreary coda: "The band has about 70 
students now." 
</P>
<P>
The once-proud Locke marching band is only one casualty of a decline in music 
education at public schools in California that started 30 years ago and 
accelerated during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although modest gains over the last two years hint that the decrescendo may be 
over, the recovery of music programs in the state's public schools could be a 
long time in coming. 
</P>
<P>
Shrinking budgets and a belief that music education was a frill have triggered 
a cutback of elementary and high school music programs in which generations of 
students were taught to appreciate music, as well as to sing and to play 
musical instruments. With fewer programs in place, it was no surprise that the 
number of music classes and music students had fallen to the lowest levels ever 
by the mid-1980s, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the number of students playing in high school bands and orchestras 
was cut almost in half between 1982 and 1986, from 124,549 to 64,989. The 
number of junior high and high school students taking other music courses 
dropped about 25% during the same period, even though student enrollment in 
grades 7 to 12 held steady at about 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the decline has been less dramatic. The percentage of junior and 
senior high students enrolled in music classes remained at about 30% from the 
end of World War II to the late 1950s, according to the U.S. Department of 
Education. But by 1960, enrollment had dropped to 28%, and by 1972 to 25%. In 
1981, the last year for which such numbers are available, only about 21% of 
students signed up for music courses, including band, orchestra and choir, as 
well as music appreciation, theory and history. 
</P>
<P>
Elementary school orchestras, once a fixture at nearly every school in the 
state, either have been eliminated or have been drastically cut back since the 
late 1960s. In the Los Angeles school district, once considered a national 
leader in music education, only about one-fourth of the 420 elementary schools 
offer instrumental music instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when we had an instrumental and choral program at every 
school, with a regular music teacher assigned to every school, plus a traveling 
music teacher," Dustin said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the district has fewer than 25 instrumental music teachers for its 
elementary schools. Seventy-two traveling music teachers are assigned to 360 
elementary schools, and each teaches as many as 1,300 students a week. The 
remaining 60 elementary schools are on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"My long-term goal is one music teacher for every elementary school or at least 
one music teacher for every 600 students," Dustin said. That would require the 
hiring of at least 300 more music teachers, an expensive and unlikely prospect, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly one-hour lessons by Los Angeles elementary school music teachers are 
by necessity fast-paced. Fourth-graders, for example, listen to the teacher 
play a version of a traditional song such as "Shenandoah." The teacher explains 
briefly the concepts of melody and chord patterns. Then the children sing and 
dance to the music. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that an hour a week isn't nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't do the job that way. Cut the roots and the tree dies," said 
Dennis Davies, music director for the Arcadia Unified School District, which 
still employs 10 music teachers for its 10 schools and offers instrument 
lessons beginning in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of Interest 
</P>
<P>
Many educators say the cutbacks at the elementary level are responsible for a 
lack of interest in music among high school students. Linda Owens, president of 
Orange County Music Administrators, said that after Proposition 13 in 1978, 
tough financial cutbacks reduced the number of music teachers dramatically. 
Some schools could only offer music instruction after school and on weekends. 
Enrollment for such courses also declined because of other extra-curricular 
activities, namely sports, that students wanted to be involved in. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also have come at the top. The number of supervisors heading music 
programs at California school districts fell from 400 in 1978 to a low of 41 in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Without those music supervisors -- whose job is to make sure that there are 
enough music teachers and instruments -- orchestra and other music classes 
became especially vulnerable to school boards looking for quick ways to save 
money, many music educators say. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the resulting sharp decline in the number of music-teaching 
positions available, college students in the last 10 years have avoided the 
field, college music educators say. Last summer, qualified music teachers could 
not be found for 38 available teaching positions around the state, said Judy 
Gunderson of the Southern California Band and Orchestra Assn., a nonprofit 
organization that promotes music programs at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say a rebound in music education may be in the works because of new 
requirements for admission to the state university system, an influx of Asian 
students and a renewed interest in adding music to statewide tests measuring 
students' achievement. Enrollment in music education statewide has risen by a 
few thousand for each of the last two years, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a slight turnaround, and we're optimistic and encouraged," said 
Francie Alexander, a state associate school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, himself a piano player, wants to 
start a $100,000 radio and television campaign to persuade the public of the 
importance of arts education. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to sell math, but when it comes to music, some people see it as 
a frill," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
A major renovation of music curricula could also come if music is added to the 
California Assessment Program, a battery of tests that show how individual 
schools compare in subjects such as math and reading, Alexander said. "What is 
tested is what gets taught," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A state task force on arts education, headed by state Assemblyman Sam Farr 
(D-Carmel), is preparing to release a report recommending that all high school 
students be required to complete a year of art and music before they can 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, high school students applying for admission to schools in 
the California State University system must complete two semesters of art and 
music. UC is considering a similar requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking Skills 
</P>
<P>
"I think public opinion is starting to support what arts educators have always 
known -- the arts contribute to thinking skills." said Joan Peterson, an arts 
consultant to the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Pollster Louis Harris last year found that 70% of U.S. parents say they would 
favor a small tax increase to give their children better education in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to asking for more money, said Donald Gunderson, music 
director at Los Altos High School in Hacienda Heights, "music teachers are the 
worst lobbyists in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson said his school's award-winning marching band has survived because of 
strong support by parents and alumni. After a season of football halftime 
shows, Gunderson said, the students break into smaller jazz and stage ensembles 
to perform more musically challenging pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Community support also has allowed music programs to survive virtually 
unscathed in school districts such as Huntington Beach, Glendale, Long Beach 
and Burbank, despite fund cutbacks caused by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a group of parents of Fountain Valley High School students raised 
more than $13,000 to keep the school's music program intact. Parents formed the 
Vocal Music Parents Assn./Vocal Music Foundation and raised enough money to pay 
salary and benefits for a full-time music teacher for the school. The growing 
Capistrano Unified School District now has 35 music teachers, contrasted with 
the 16 they had five years ago, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many educators attribute part of the resurgence to an influx of Asians into the 
community. "A lot of our Chinese and Korean students study the piano and a 
string instrument," said music director Davies of the Arcadia school district. 
</P>
<P>
Some music educators speculate that the decline of music education began with 
the 1957 launch of Sputnik. Parents and politicians, fearful of falling behind 
Soviet technology, demanded more emphasis on science and math at the expense of 
school arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sputnik ended a golden era of music in the 1950s," said Henry Use, a retired 
music director and co-chairman of the Legislative Action Coalition for Arts 
Education. "It stung the American pride, and people asked, 'If the Russians can 
do it, why can't we do it?' The perception was that we weren't putting out good 
engineers, and people called for more science and math requirements that took 
up music time." 
</P>
<P>
But it took more than a Soviet satellite to shoot down music education. Voters 
and their representatives also contributed to the decline. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature approved the state's 1983 school reform laws, enacted to 
toughen graduation requirements, students were given the choice of taking a 
foreign language instead of art or music. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're college-bound, you're going to take foreign language," said Su 
Stauffer, a Northern California parent and longtime music activist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the California Legislature eliminated all music requirements for 
prospective teachers, who previously were expected to read music, sing and play 
an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
That change, which was included in legislation creating the state Commission on 
Teacher Credentialing, probably happened by accident, said Ken Lane, head of 
teacher training at UC Berkeley's School of Education. Legislators working on 
the changes wanted to simplify the credentialing process, as well as to 
increase teacher training in subjects such as math, science and English, Lane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be a demotion for music," said Lane, who wrote his 
dissertation on the 1970 Ryan Act, which established state 
teacher-credentialing laws. 
</P>
<P>
Music appreciation, which traditionally had included memorizing classical music 
and composers, was discarded from the curriculum at most school districts at 
about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
With few specially trained music teachers available, most elementary schools 
have had to rely on regular classroom teachers for music instruction, even 
though most of them have little or no training in music. 
</P>
<P>
"Elementary school teachers are not prepared to teach music," said Cecilia 
Riddell, who teaches a music course at Cal State Dominguez Hills. "They take a 
one-unit course from me, which is supposed to teach them all they need to know 
about singing, listening, folk dances and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, said Riddell -- who has taught music to classroom 
teachers for 25 years -- is that the current generation of college students 
training to be teachers learned little themselves about music in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up in Redwood City there was a certain body of literature that 
everybody was expected to know," said Riddell, who attended elementary school 
shortly after the end of World War II. "Pieces like . . . the overture to 'The 
Magic Flute' by Mozart, the 'Nutcracker Suite.' Now, I'm astonished how many of 
my students have never even heard 'Peter and the Wolf.' "

MURDER SUSPECTS' HOST COUNTS BLESSINGS

<P>
Pennsylvania college professor Peter G. Jones was counting his blessings 
Tuesday after police declared that he probably would have been the next target 
of three murder suspects who were guests in his home. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a 57-year-old English teacher on sabbatical from Pittsburgh's 
Carnegie-Mellon University, said he had developed a longstanding pen pal 
relationship with one of his guests, former Indiana prison inmate Keith Eugene 
Goodman, 30. When Goodman showed up last weekend, Jones thought it was only 
because he had invited him to stay while adjusting to life after serving time 
for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Jones said, he and Goodman spent the day watching football on 
television. At one point, after Goodman had gone downstairs to take a shower, 
the telephone rang. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gone down to tell him the score of the game," Jones recalled, "when 
I got a phone call from the police and they said to keep talking." Moments 
later, members of a SWAT team burst into the house and arrested Goodman -- "He 
still had shaving cream on his face when they whisked him away," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman's companions -- Christopher Mead, 22, and Mead's girlfriend, Tracy Lynn 
Holland, 21 -- had been staying with him downstairs but were arrested at a 
separate location. Some or all of the three are suspects in four murders of 
homosexual men in New York and Mississippi, and another killing in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Jones declined to explain how he obtained Goodman's name as a pen pal, but he 
said the two began exchanging letters four years ago. He even traveled to a 
state prison in Michigan City, Ind., to visit Goodman behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said his new friend painted a picture of a lonely past, forsaken by 
family and imprisoned for robbery at age 18. 
</P>
<P>
"The story I heard was certainly that he had been very deprived," Jones 
recalled. "He said he had never known who his father was. He had never gotten 
along with his mother and hadn't seen her since he was 16. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He (Goodman) said the other night, in fact, that the only person who had ever 
loved him was his grandmother and she died about a year ago. I don't even know 
if that was true," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman and his two companions arrived at Jones' house about midnight Friday, 
telling him they had driven nonstop from New Mexico. Jones said he did not 
suspect that anything was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly looked like they had been driving that long, but now that I 
think about it, some things probably weren't quite right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I let a stranger into my home," he said. "You think you know 
someone and you don't."

Former Orange County Congressman Dan Lungren, the only announced Republican 
candidate for attorney general, named his campaign team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente lawyer and longtime adviser to Gov. George 
Deukmejian, will serve as principle strategist. 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian was a speech writer for President Reagan and a senior adviser to 
Vice President Dan Quayle during the 1988 presidential campaign. He also served 
as a consultant and senior adviser to Sen. Pete Wilson in his 1988 re-election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren represented the 42nd District in Congress from 1979 to 1989, when he 
decided not to seek reelection. The district, which includes Long Beach and 
parts of northwest Orange County, now is represented by former White House 
speech writer Dana Rohrabacher, also a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren also hired Don Ringe, a Washington media consultant who worked on Sen. 
Robert Dole's 1988 presidential bid as well as the campaigns of Florida Gov. 
Bob Martinez and Texas Gov. Bill Clements. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren's pollster will be Dick Dresner, who also is conducting polls for 
Wilson's campaign for governor and the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission that my team has accepted is the re-taking of the attorney 
general's office from the liberal Democrats, who have held it hostage for eight 
long years," Lungren said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren is running unopposed for the GOP nomination to replace Attorney General 
John K. Van de Kamp, who is stepping down to run for governor. Los Angeles 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith are battling 
for the Democratic nomination.

3 COUNTY FIRMS RANKED WORST OZONE FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-powered environmental group has listed three Orange County companies 
among the nation's 60 worst ozone polluters. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley Laboratories of Irvine, Greif Brothers Corp. of La Palma and Rockwell 
International Corp. of Anaheim were ranked high on a list of more than 3,000 
companies that used three chemicals known to deplete the Earth's protective 
ozone layer, according to a report released Tuesday by the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on chemical release data collected by the federal government 
under the federal "right to know" law, identified all U.S. industrial 
facilities that in 1987 reported discharging more than 2,000 pounds of any of 
three ozone-depleting substances: methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and a 
type of chlorofluorocarbon known as CFC-113. Except in a few cases, the 1987 
figures are the most current available. 
</P>
<P>
"California was the No. 1 state for ozone-depleting companies, and Orange 
County was very high on the list," said Deborah Sheiman, co-author of the 
report, which was prepared by the council, based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 56 Orange County companies, which manufacture everything from steel 
drums to high-tech medical equipment, appeared on the list. 
</P>
<P>
None of the firms are in violation of state or federal air pollution standards, 
and some of the companies have since stopped using the ozone-damaging chemicals 
or begun using more acceptable substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Members of resources council said they published the list to trigger public 
concern and prompt legislation to ban the use of the three chemicals that are 
destroying the ozone layer, which prevents damaging ultraviolet radiation from 
penetrating the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to draw attention to these 3,000 companies so that all the cities and 
communities will go ask them to stop destroying the ozone layer," Sheiman said. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited the Pratt &amp; Whitney plant in East Hartford, Conn., as the 
nation's worst ozone-polluter in 1987 but noted that the discharge of methyl 
chloroform from the facility had decreased by 77% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked highest among Orange County firms was Bentley Laboratories, at No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The company uses a form of CFC-113 in manufacturing oxygenators, which are used 
during open-heart surgery, said Geoffrey Fenton, a spokesman for Bentley's 
parent company, Baxter Healthcare Corp. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But within one year, Fenton said, Bentley's emission of the chemical has 
dropped by 65%, from 250,000 pounds in 1987 to 89,000 pounds in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, he noted, resulted from improvements in storing and recycling 
CFC-113 and a shift toward a more environmentally sound production system at 
its Irvine plant. Bentley Labs has spent about $200,000 to reduce hazardous 
emissions and by 1996 hopes to reduce 1988 emission levels by 80%, Fenton said. 
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, Irvine will enact a sweeping ozone law severely restricting the 
use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals. The law will prohibit the sale 
and manufacture of any ozone-harming substances, but company officials may file 
for exemptions if they believe their businesses would be jeopardized by the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental group ranked the Greif Brothers Corp. No. 44, but plant 
manager Robert St. Onge denied that the company, which produces steel drums, 
uses ozone-depleting chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using nothing like that as far as I know," St. Onge said. "They can come 
here and check our invoices and raw materials. . . . They won't find anything." 
</P>
<P>
Greif Brothers does use the chemical tricloroethane-111 to degrease steel drum 
parts, St. Onge said. Sheiman said that chemical is a synonym for methyl 
chloroform, one of the chemicals tracked in the study. 
</P>
<P>
St. Onge said his company's use of the chemical is well within federal 
regulations.

Rockwell International of Anaheim, which was ranked No. 59, reported CFC-113 
emissions of 210,000 pounds in 1987. But that figure dropped to 70,000 pounds 
in 1988, company spokesman Tony Longo said. 
</P>
<P>
Longo attributed the reduction to more accurate emissions reporting. Rockwell 
uses the chemical to clean machines that build navigational systems for 
military vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Rockwell nor Greif plans to reduce the use of the ozone-damaging 
chemicals, saying there are no adequate substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The resources council warned that if steps aren't taken soon to protect the 
ozone layer, millions more cases of skin cancer and cataracts as well as 
millions of dollars in crop damage could result from the increase in 
ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report urged the federal Environmental Protection Agency to 
require companies to report emissions of seven other ozone-depleting 
substances.

PROPOSED BUILDING FREEZE OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed temporary building freeze here would violate the Mission Viejo Co.'s 
developer agreement with the county, a top corporate officer of the company 
said Tuesday, adding that the company is firmly opposed to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"That agreement says that in exchange for certain public benefits, we get the 
right to develop," David A. Celestin, vice president for planning and 
governmental relations, said in an interview. "We would definitely oppose" the 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Celestin's comments marked the first direct response from the company to the 
controversial building moratorium proposal introduced last year by City 
Councilman Robert A. Curtis. Although company officials have previously 
downplayed the proposal's importance, they had never indicated the company's 
position or suggested that the proposal could represent a violation of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Curtis rejected Celestin's argument, saying that local ordinances 
temporarily halting new development have been upheld elsewhere in California. 
Santa Clarita, for instance, enacted a building freeze in 1987, and it remains 
in effect today. 
</P>
<P>
Under Curtis' proposal, all new residential building inside the city limits 
would be halted until the city's General Plan is complete. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean a building freeze of at least several months, and possibly as 
much as a year, said Curtis, who is the subject of a recall effort backed by 
the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a timeout in this building frenzy," Curtis said. "The company is 
trying to divest itself of its remaining acreage, and we need to make sure that 
we protect our open space and parkland." 
</P>
<P>
Celestin, however, said the company has no intention of building more than 
1,400 more residential units, consistent with its original plans for the 
community, created in 1965 and scheduled for completion within the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any higher densities," Celestin said. "We want to complete this 
community just the way we originally set out to." 
</P>
<P>
After heated City Council debate last week, Curtis' proposal was referred to 
the city staff for its recommendations. The staff was asked to complete its 
review in time for the council's meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the council could vote on the freeze or on any other suggested 
measures to regulate growth in the city. JIM NEWTON

COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON GUN DEALERS' FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday postponed a final vote on a new city law that would 
impose a $200 annual fee on firearms dealers who sell concealable weapons after 
about 30 gun activists showed up to protest the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The council put off action until Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jack White said the proposed ordinance is mandated under a recent 
legal opinion by the state attorney general that requires cities to require a 
special license for gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers say the new license would be unfair because they already pay an 
annual $21 business license fee. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Tolley, a firearms instructor from Anaheim, said the Police Department 
already has a list of federally licensed dealers in the area. Some dealers 
complained that the $200 fee is too expensive.

INMATE STILL ON RUN AFTER ESCAPING JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Tuesday continued to search for an inmate who escaped from a 
minimum-security jail Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Noriega turned up missing at a 5:30 a.m. bed check in the James A. 
Musick Branch Jail at Irvine Boulevard and Alton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably just jumped a fence, but we don't know how he escaped at this 
time," said sheriff's Sgt. Bill Voltin. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, also known as Jorge Carlos Rodriguez, was arrested Dec. 19 and charged 
with burglary and receiving stolen property, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He is described as being 27 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, 150 pounds, with 
black hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The escapee was sent to the Musick Branch Jail, a minimum-security facility 
near the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, on Dec. 21.

DRAWING OF ARSON SUSPECT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire Department officials on Tuesday released a drawing of a suspect in the 
Dec. 26, $2-million arson fire that destroyed a Thrifty Drug Store at a 
shopping center at Katella Avenue and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department Capt. Bill Dumas said the suspect's likeness was drawn from 
descriptions given to officials by an employee and other people who were in the 
store about 9:30 p.m. when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is a male, possibly Latino, between 30 and 40 years old, about 6 
feet, 1 inch tall and weighing about 200 pounds. He has short, dark wavy hair 
that is combed back, Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the suspect started the fire in a paper goods section of the store 
in order to distract people so that he could steal merchandise from the store," 
said Dumas, adding that an employee had been watching the suspect in the store 
because of his suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect disappeared after the fire started, Dumas said. "I don't think he 
(the suspect) believed the fire would get out of control," Dumas added. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who may recognize the suspect should call the Fire Department at (714) 
741-5626.

ROTH WOULD NAME TERMINAL AFTER RILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's airport may be named after an actor who sometimes played a 
Marine, but its new $50-million passenger terminal may be named for a real-life 
Marine Corps general -- Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, whose district includes John Wayne Airport, has made the terminal's 
completion a personal mission throughout much of his 15 years on the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The new chairman of the board, Don R. Roth, announced during his 1990 
chairmanship speech Tuesday that he would seek the dedication in honor of 
Riley, a longtime friend and a retired Marine Corps brigadier general. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't help but think that this has been the general's life the last couple 
of years," said Roth, himself a former Navy aviator. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Roth also laid out his priorities for his one-year term as 
chairman: an emphasis on regional solutions to problems common to contiguous 
counties, including his own proposal to build a jail in the Riverside County 
desert, and a simplified budget process more understandable to supervisors and 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he looks to the county administrative office to "overhaul our 
antiquated budget process and to take a long and deep look at the way we do our 
financial business." 
</P>
<P>
The other supervisors are supportive of at least exploring Roth's idea to build 
a jail in the desert. Roth continued Tuesday to pour water on the board's 
previously approved plan to build a jail in Gypsum Canyon in northeastern 
Orange County with the help of a voter-approved sales tax increase. That plan 
is opposed by Roth and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez as well as by some residents 
in nearby Yorba Linda and Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I have deep reservations about a sales tax as a financing mechanism," Roth 
said. "By eliminating the site-specific opposition, I believe we can convince 
two-thirds of Orange County's voters to approve general obligation bonds to 
build needed criminal justice facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Roth's plan to name the new airport terminal for Riley came as a surprise -- 
even to Riley, who said he was "very honored" and "a little shocked." 
</P>
<P>
The new terminal is part of a $310-million airport modernization program that 
includes new aircraft taxiways, roadways, parking garages and special freeway 
ramps reserved for airport traffic. The terminal's construction has been 
hampered by repeated delays, and its completion date was recently moved back 
from April 1 to Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the idea to name the terminal for Riley was proposed in a letter 
several months ago by the Orange County Aviation Council, a group of 
aviation-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Vasquez both said they support the idea, which 
Roth plans to put before the board soon. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that he has turned down requests to have projects named for him, 
including a park along Upper Newport Bay and a square in Dana Point, because he 
was still on the board and thought there might be some opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Riley will still be on the board in September, too -- and he plans to run for 
reelection in November -- but he said he will not object this time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be over, and I've spent a lot of time on it," Riley said. "If 
someone had suggested it to me over a cup of coffee, I might have found reasons 
why we shouldn't do it, but I didn't know about it . . . and I'm not sure Emma 
Jane Riley (his wife) would be happy if I fought it." BOB SCHWARTZ

FORECASTERS EXPECT ANOTHER DAY OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forecasters say Orange County should be in for another day of rain today, much 
to the relief of water officials and farmers who hope that this could signal 
the end of a four-year pattern of relatively dry winters. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to see rain for 20 days and 20 nights," said Barbara Buck, a 
spokeswoman for the Irvine-based Western Growers Assn. "The farmers were ready 
to do rain dances. It was as though they were farming salt fields." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the rain created havoc for some on Orange County roads and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported about 50 minor accidents during a 
three-hour period Tuesday evening. "They were all over the freeways," a CHP 
spokesman said. "People overestimate their cabability of braking in this 
weather." 
</P>
<P>
The foul weather forced the National Guard armories in Fullerton and Santa Ana 
to open Tuesday night and shelter the homeless. Wayne Warner, a program manager 
for the Orange County Social Services Agency, said that about 60 people checked 
into the armory in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
State guidelines require that the armories open when the temperature drops to 
50 degrees and it is raining, Warner said. When it isn't raining, he said, the 
temperature must drop to 40 degrees before armories will open. 
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday rain measured from 0.18 of an inch in Anaheim to a trace in Newport 
Beach to none at all in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The latest rain is the result of a storm system from the Gulf of Alaska that 
has brought wet weather and cooler temperatures. Showers are predicted to 
continue through today, according to Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist for 
WeatherData, a Wichita, Kan.-based company that provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County can expect one-third to one inch of rain, he said, and possibly a 
thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Highs today will be in the mid-50s to mid-60s. Clouds will clear tonight, with 
a slight chance of a few lingering showers. Lows will be in the mid-30s to 
mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's forecast calls for clear skies and highs in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
Sizable amounts of rain have been reported since the start of the storms last 
weekend. According to the Orange County Flood Control District, Huntington 
Beach has had half an inch of rain; Yorba Linda two inches; Santiago Peak, 4.1 
inches; Mission Viejo, 1.3 inches and El Toro, 0.8 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Although the storms have created several small mudslides in hilly, eastern 
areas of the county, the ground has not been oversaturated, said Bill Reider, 
the county's public works operations manager at the Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
But the county isn't out of the drought yet. After today's showers, forecasters 
predict a high-pressure system to again settle in, bringing dry weather to the 
county for three to five days, Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent rains have only been a drop in the bucket compared to the 
shortfall caused by the drought. Jim Van Haun, a spokesman for the county's 
water district, said that since Oct. 1, the district's station in Anaheim has 
recorded about three inches of rain. Normal is about 6 to 6.5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very worried when we saw bone-dry December," Haun said. "We're getting 
there. This helps, but we have a long way to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
Haun said that it would take about three or more spurts of rain like this one 
to match the normal rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for some farmers, the heavy rains have been a mixed blessing. The heavy 
water droplets have created minor damage to some of the county's $43-million 
strawberry industry, Buck said.

DEAL NAILED RIZZITELLO, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reputed racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello did not shoot and leave for dead a 
Mustang Club topless bar financier, but he ended up charged with the crime as a 
result of a deal prosecutors made with the victim, Rizzitello's defense 
attorney said in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
William Carroll, 57, was left blind when shot three times in the head in a 
Costa Mesa parking garage near midnight on April 30, 1981. He refused to say 
who shot him for 18 months but finally named Rizzitello, 62, as the gunman and 
Joseph Angelo Grosso, 45, as a participant. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier told jurors in his opening statement 
at Rizzitello's trial Tuesday that Carroll named Rizzitello only because he 
hoped prosecutors would give him a break on a criminal case of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Carroll knew he could get the maximum. . . . He responded to prosecutors' 
desire to nail Mr. Rizzitello," Brooklier contended. "Fifteen minutes later, 
Mr. Carroll walks away (from the charges)." Brooklier claimed that the real 
gunman was Big George Yudzevich, a bouncer at the club who later was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who took the witness stand after Brooklier spoke to the jury, 
testified emphatically that no one from the district attorney's office made him 
any deals. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll had faced felony charges of grand theft in connection with information 
he provided for a bank loan. But in October, 1988, a judge found him guilty 
only of a misdemeanor and ordered no sentence or fine. Moments later, Carroll 
named Rizzitello and Grosso as his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors have called Brooklier's accusation ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that Rizzitello wanted Carroll dead because he was an obstacle to 
Rizzitello's attempt to muscle in on the profits at the topless bar, which has 
since closed because of arson fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Three bullets in the head wasn't to scare him," Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher 
J. Evans told jurors in his opening statement. "It was to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that Rizzitello and Grosso asked him to take them to the parking 
garage to get Grosso's car. But Carroll said that when they got there, 
Rizzitello grabbed him from behind, shoved a gun to his left temple, and said, 
"This is for not letting us eat." 
</P>
<P>
Another key witness against Rizzitello is Gene Lesher, the former manager of 
the Mustang who controlled the finances at the club after Carroll was shot. 
Lesher has previously testified that he caved in to threats from Rizzitello 
after being threatened with the same fate as Carroll, and paid Rizzitello 
$5,000 a week through Yudzevich. Yudzevich was found dead, with three shots to 
the head, in Irvine nearly a year after the Carroll shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Brooklier told jurors Tuesday that it wasn't Rizzitello 
who gained any money. It was Lesher, Grosso and Yudzevich who put together the 
scheme to take profits from the club, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso was convicted two months ago of attempted murder for his role in the 
Carroll shooting. Carroll testified that Grosso held his legs down while the 
shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether prosecutors will call Grosso to testify against 
Rizzitello. Grosso testified at his trial that Rizzitello fired the shots into 
Carroll but denied involvement himself. In an earlier statement to The Times, 
Grosso blamed the shooting on Yudzevich. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, Brooklier hammered away at inconsistencies between 
Carroll's testimony Tuesday and his earlier testimony or statements to police. 
But prosecutors contend that any inconsistencies are minor. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll became visibly upset when Brooklier concentrated on why he did not 
identify his assailants to authorities on the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about self-preservation," Carroll said. "I was only thinking 
about staying alive." 
</P>
<P>
Cross-examination of Carroll continues today in Superior Court Judge John L. 
Flynn Jr.'s courtroom. JERRY HICKS

A retired Illinois judge apparently shot and killed a Newport Beach real estate 
agent and then turned the gun on himself, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome C. Slad, 72, and Geraldine (Jeri) Margaret Hunt, 57, were found dead in 
an upstairs bedroom of Hunt's Laguna Niguel townhouse on Monday. A neighbor, 
concerned about not seeing Hunt for two days, had called police. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a murder-suicide," Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. 
Olson said. He added that a .38-caliber pistol was found near Slad's hand. The 
two were found in bed together, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Slad was married but had been a close friend of Hunt for some time, according 
to her friends. No motives were immediately apparent and no suicide note has 
been found, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary autopsy report Tuesday found that each died from a single gunshot 
wound to the head. Investigators believe the shootings occurred early Saturday 
morning, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Slad's son expressed shock at the circumstances of his father's death. In a 
telephone interview from Chicago, Jerome C. Slad Jr. said his father and 
mother, Elia, had two homes, one in Chicago and the other in Rancho Santa Fe in 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
He said his parents commuted between their residences frequently. Slad's wife 
was in Chicago Tuesday, the son said. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was an honest, upright man," the younger Slad said. He said that 
when police telephoned him Monday night to explain the details of the slayings, 
he told them that "I didn't want to hear any more." 
</P>
<P>
Slad retired eight years ago as a circuit court judge in Cook County, Illinois. 
Before becoming a judge, he was a well-known attorney who ran an unsuccessful 
campaign for state senator. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Jr. said he talked to his father "a short while ago" and he didn't seem 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Arliss Kirschmer, a close friend and business partner of Hunt, said she had met 
Slad on several occasions and he "always seemed like a gentle man. . . . I 
can't imagine him doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's friends said that she was very respected and well-liked within the real 
estate community. She owned Hunt Associates in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very elegant lady. I don't know one real estate person in the whole 
area that was so wonderful," said Barbara Aune, a friend who once worked with 
Hunt. "The news of her death has just been devastating for her friends."

DISTRICT EXEMPTED FROM COSTS OF EXCESS RUNOFF; 
</P>
<P>
WATER: THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS GIVES TAXPAYERS A BREAK BY NOT CHARGING A 
FEE OF UP TO $150,000 A YEAR.

<P>
In a victory for Orange County, the federal government has reversed itself and 
decided against charging the county's water district up to $150,000 a year for 
the right to use water now being dumped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Mills Jr., general manager of the Orange County Water District, said 
of the decision: "It is a tremendous relief. . . . The people of Orange County 
should not have to pay for water that would otherwise end up in the Pacific 
Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The decision, spelled out in a letter from Assistant Army Secretary Robert W. 
Page to Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), ends a dispute that began 
last August. Then, the Army Corps of Engineers notified the water district that 
it planned to implement a new pricing policy for excess water stored for the 
district's use behind the Prado Dam in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The corps operates the dam largely for flood-control purposes, but it has made 
some reservoir water available to the water district on an informal basis over 
the years. Recently, the corps had decided to charge for the water. 
</P>
<P>
However, "because the pricing policy was only recently developed, we agree that 
in this instance, it would be inequitable to apply the policy to the Orange 
County Water District at such a late date," Page wrote in the letter to Cox. 
Page said the Army may implement the policy elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers of Orange County have won a big victory," said Cox, who was 
joined by Orange County's four other representatives in opposing the corps' 
action. Cox, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) 
met with Page last November to protest the Army's plan. 
</P>
<P>
The policy stemmed in part from a new federal directive to recoup the value of 
services provided as a result of federal projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the new policy is sustainable, and we'll use it" elsewhere, said 
Earl H. Stockdale, senior assistant to the Army's general counsel. "But because 
the folks out there (in Orange County) got caught right out of the gate, we're 
going to wait and defer it there." 
</P>
<P>
District officials had been pushing for a formal agreement under which the Army 
would raise the level of the reservoir behind the Prado Dam and then slowly 
release as much as 1.6 billion gallons of excess spring runoff each year, 
allowing the district to divert the water into its massive underground storage 
basin. The naturally occurring basin of sand and gravel can store as much as 
3.2 trillion gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
The district had agreed to pay all extra costs associated with the storage of 
additional water, perhaps as much as $15 million, but the corps insisted that 
it wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reimbursement for its expenses, the Army planned to charge the 
district a fee based on the water's market value, a move that outraged local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The additional costs would have been passed along to most Orange County water 
users, because the Orange County Water District sells its water to the 40 or so 
other water districts in the county. Those districts draw about 70% of the 
water they sell to customers from the OCWD's reservoir through a system of 
about 500 wells.

MIKE PENNER: PATIENCE IS A NECESSITY, NOT VIRTUE FOR RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three days after the Rams burst and we're still bailing . . . 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young picked up 40-some sympathizers to the cause Sunday after San 
Francisco out-zeroed the Rams, 30-3. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Joe Montana to retire is now a Ram concern. 
</P>
<P>
Young has been waiting since 1987, when he thought it was a great time to leave 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and become a 49er. Remember the back surgery that 
ended Montana's quarterbacking career back in '86? 
</P>
<P>
Reincarnation has been wonderful to Montana, who, post-op, is three-for-three 
in NFC West championships and bidding for a second consecutive Super Bowl 
title. Young, meanwhile, has become his generation's Earl Morrall -- backup to 
a legend -- and will probably be Steve Old before Montana calls it quits. 
</P>
<P>
How long will the Rams have to wait on the sidelines of the Super Bowl? The 
early prognosis isn't bright. The rest of Montana's body is 33, but his back is 
only 3. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Montana is 8-0 against the Rams at Anaheim Stadium, a big 1-0 
against them in NFC championship games and commander of the same type of 
damn-him respect the Rams used to have for Roger Staubach and Fran Tarkenton. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Young remains the odd man out, figure the Rams to be the awed men 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Play of the game? How about Ronnie Lott's great retreat on Jim Everett's 
underthrow to Flipper Anderson as play of the year? 
</P>
<P>
Before Lott's startling recovery, Everett looked his normal self against the 
49ers -- five of eight for 61 yards to five receivers. 
</P>
<P>
After the deflection, Everett's next eight passes produced three completions, 
three incompletions and two interceptions, leading to a 14-3 49er lead. 
</P>
<P>
Everett appeared rattled the rest of the game, the confidence that had carried 
him through the Philadelphia and New York games was ebbing with each dropback. 
And with their leader shaken, the Rams didn't need long to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks a Lott. 
</P>
<P>
The name is Harold Jackson. The date was Dec. 26, 1976. The play was a 
five-yard pass from Pat Haden. 
</P>
<P>
The significance? 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is the last Ram to score a touchdown in an NFC championship game. Since 
that reception, which closed the Rams' scoring in a 24-13 loss to Minnesota, 
the Rams have been to four NFC title games -- and have come away with four 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
1978: Dallas 28, Rams 0 
</P>
<P>
1979: Rams 9, Tampa Bay 0 
</P>
<P>
1985: Chicago 24, Rams 0 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday: San Francisco 30, Rams 3 
</P>
<P>
And they somehow got to one Super Bowl through all of that. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky team. 
</P>
<P>
Most valuable Ram: Everett. We saw what happened when he was off his game. 
</P>
<P>
Most improved Ram: Anderson. And to think Terry Donahue once had Anderson, Troy 
Aikman and Gaston Green in the same offense. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Ram: Mike Piel. The winner by technicality -- he was drafted in 1988 but 
spent all of that season on injured reserve -- and by default. Piel started six 
regular-season games and all three playoff games, filling one of the Rams' 
chasms at defensive end. The only other rookies to start at least one game were 
linebacker Frank Stams (three starts) and defensive tackle Bill Hawkins (one). 
</P>
<P>
Underrated Ram: Buford McGee. Did a little of everything and everything well. 
Sunday, he was about the only receiver Everett could get the ball to. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' top five needs for 1990: 
</P>
<P>
1. A cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
2. A pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
3. A cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
4. A pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
5. A punter. 
</P>
<P>
They'll probably draft a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Five reasons for Rams to believe in 1990: 
</P>
<P>
1. The comebacks against New Orleans, Dallas, New England and New York. Yes, 
the Rams can play clutch football. 
</P>
<P>
2. Bill Hawkins, Clifford Hicks, Anthony Newman, Doug Reed and Vincent Newsome 
will be healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
3. Everett, Anderson, Robert Delpino, Fred Strickland, Larry Kelm and Cleveland 
Gary will be a year wiser. 
</P>
<P>
4. Jerry Gray moves to free safety, closing the Ronnie Lott gap. 
</P>
<P>
5. The 49ers could get bored with Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Things we'll miss by the Rams missing New Orleans: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The LeRoy Irvin Show going national. A loss for all humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seven days of John Robinson recounting the Dickerson trade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seven days of John Robinson recounting the Everett trade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "So, Willie, why do they call you Flipper?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rammy Whammy II towels and other great souvenir possibilities. Fritz Grits, 
anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Ram victory over Denver. It would've happened. The NFL championship was 
decided last Sunday at Candlestick.

EVEN WITHOUT EARLE, ESTANCIA BREEZES PAST NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Estancia High School girls' basketball team ended its two-game Sea View 
League losing streak with a 63-43 victory over Newport Harbor Tuesday night at 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Without leading scorer and point guard Melody Earle, the Eagles (7-8, 1-2) 
struggled while losing to University and Saddleback. Earle chipped a bone in 
her left ankle in the opening round of the Marina Tournament. But she continued 
to limp through several games before sitting out the first two league games on 
the advice of her doctor, Estancia Coach Lisa McNamee said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night the Eagles again looked as if they would struggle without Earle's 
18 points a game, but Estancia outscored Newport Harbor, 26-11, in the fourth 
quarter to turn a close game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia took advantage of the boards and the Sailors' 30 turnovers with 
Monique Sweet pushing the ball up court for easy transition baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to get rolling without Melody," Estancia Coach Lisa 
McNamee said. "Tonight we had other people respond offensively." 
</P>
<P>
Those other people were sophomore Sweet and senior Liz Collins. Sweet, who had 
been averaging 14 points, stepped up her offensive production. She led all 
scorers with 26 points. Collins responded on the boards grabbing 19 rebounds 
and scoring 12 points. Estancia continually scored second-chance baskets when 
Sweet wasn't pushing the ball up court, but the real key was defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them at halftime that Stacey Giem was getting a little bit frustrated 
on offense, and she basically is their offense," McNamee said. "No doubt about 
it, Patrice (Lumpkin) holding her down was the key to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lumpkin scored 15 points and held Giem to 16. Jenni Hall added 13 for Newport 
Harbor (5-8, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Estancia led, 41-38, with five minutes to play when Sailor point guard Alison 
Izumita left the game with her fifth foul. Collins sank both free throws, 
Lumpkin added a basket and Sweet, who was fouled, made her first free throw. 
She missed her second but Collins' follow was good for a three-point play that 
put Estancia firmly in front, 48-38. 
</P>
<P>
In other Sea View games: 
</P>
<P>
University 44, Saddleback 30 -- Senior forward Denise Gandara scored 25 points 
and had 11 rebounds to lead University (12-4, 2-1). Sophomore center Tara Wolff 
had eight points, a career-high 20 rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 66, Corona del Mar 29 -- Christine Garner had 21 points and Nancy Vinh 
had 12 as Tustin (14-5, 3-0) outscored host Corona del Mar 24-1 in the fourth 
quarter.

FORMER TITAN PITCHER FERRIERI FINDS WORK IN FOREIGN LEGION OF SOFTBALL

<P>
JoAnn Ferrieri left Cal State Fullerton with some very marketable skills -- 
pitching and hitting a softball -- but the market, it turned out, was far away. 
</P>
<P>
Like many women athletes, Ferrieri finished her college career with no clear 
options in sports. She had been an All-American in 1985 and helped win a 
national championship at Fullerton in 1986. If her talent had been golf or 
tennis, perhaps it would have been different. 
</P>
<P>
But softball? She could play on club teams in the Amateur Softball Assn., but 
she couldn't make a living at it. She could coach, as she did at Tustin High 
School in 1987 and '88, or give private lessons. She could earn enough to get 
by. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferrieri found a way to play and get paid in an Italian professional 
league, where she and other American players are stars. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, her first season in Italy, Ferrieri made about $1,500 a month, with 
living expenses paid. 
</P>
<P>
It's not Danny Ferry's deal, but it will do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm making a good living," said Ferrieri, who lives in North Hollywood and 
gives private lessons when she is not in Italy, where she plays for the team of 
the city of Parma in the northern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big tourist town," Ferrieri said. "It's really elegant." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrieri took to the Italian life. The teams play only once a week, Sunday 
doubleheaders, and are off during August. There is a bit of time to fill, but 
the cuisine of Italy can keep you occupied, Ferrieri said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Ferrieri's first season, Parma won the Italian championship. She went 
back last year to play the April-to-November season again, and she plans to go 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way for me to make a living and play softball, Ferrieri said. "It's a 
chance for me to be treated the way a professional athlete should be treated. I 
wish it was like that here, but it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Other former Fullerton athletes have played in Italy, where there is a limit of 
two Americans a team. Among them are Kathy Van Wyk, Rina Foster, Debi Jones and 
Valerie Van Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
The teams, which are corporately sponsored, draw perhaps 150 fans to 
regular-season games. In the championship games, they sometimes draw 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
And in Parma one season, Ferrieri recalled, the softball team had an extra 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
"The Parma baseball team was awful," she said. "People would say, 'Go watch the 
softball team. They're better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Proposed Titan Gym expansion: Funding for the preliminary design of the 
expansion and improvement of Titan Gym is included in Gov. George Deukmejian's 
1990-91 budget proposal released last week. 
</P>
<P>
Should the $200,000 item stand after legislative approval, Fullerton could 
undertake the first step in a 1,000-seat expansion. Funding for working 
drawings and construction would be subject to future budgets. Athletic Director 
Ed Carroll said the expansion could be complete no sooner than the 1993 
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton tentatively plans to open the second side of the upper level of Titan 
Gym, giving the facility two upstairs gymnasiums, an improvement that would 
relieve scheduling conflicts for team practices. Carroll also said there is a 
plan to replace some of the facility's bleachers with chair-back seats, in 
addition to adding seating for 1,000 more fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Once that's done," Carroll said with a laugh, "we'd probably change the name 
from Titan Gym to Titan Arena." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williams and Cedric Ceballos both complained about not pressing in the 
second half of Monday night's loss to San Jose State. "We should have pressed," 
Williams said. "I also felt we should have gone to man." Ceballos echoed 
Williams' sentiments about the press, which the Titans used with some success 
in the early going. "We should keep doing what got us the lead," Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure: The statistics of the women's basketball team are an invitation for 
teams to press. The Titans, riding a five-game losing streak, are averaging 26 
turnovers a game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the story of our lives," Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah said. "Hawaii pressed 
us 40 minutes. UNLV pressed us some. Long Beach pressed us, San Diego State 
pressed us, Fresno pressed us. I'm sure Pacific will press us." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have fallen to 6-9 overall, 1-5 in the Big West Conference, and the 
losing streak is the longest since the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is inexperience and a lack of depth and a point guard. Jeannine 
Battaglia has been forced to handle the role since her strongest competition, 
Jennifer Beckmeyer, was lost for the season with herniated discs. The bench is 
so shallow that when Battaglia is out, 5-9 junior forward Jill Matyuch moves to 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just not a point guard," Jeremiah said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will try to stem the losing streak Saturday at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to get back over .500 and look respectable," Jeremiah said. "We're 
doing all right. We're going to be OK. We wish we were 10-2 or 13-1, but we're 
not. We're going to see if we can go back and salvage the conference and go to 
the (Big West) tournament and beat somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Help at point guard is on the way. Edison High School's Michelle Hennessey 
signed a letter of intent last fall to attend Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Football signings: Four community college players have signed letters of intent 
to play at Fullerton: running back Derek Black (Mt. San Jacinto), defensive 
lineman Andy Fears (Sacramento City), running back Mark King (Palomar) and 
cornerback Donyea Lee (Fresno City). 
</P>
<P>

STATWATCH: BRANTLEY LETS DEEDS DO TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All it took was a verbal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canoga Park High Coach Jeff Davis stated that he believes he has one 
of the best guard tandems in the Valley, second only to Cleveland's. 
</P>
<P>
Jermoine Brantley disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, a senior point guard at Granada Hills High, scored 20 points and had 
15 rebounds in last Friday's 100-73 victory over Canoga Park. His backcourt 
mate, Osiris Nalls, had 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They're supposed to have the second-best group in the Valley," Brantley said 
before the Canoga Park game. "I'd like to thank them for the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
That performance capped a rock-solid week for Brantley. In Wednesday's 81-72 
win over San Fernando, the three-year letterman had 29 points and 10 assists. 
It was no anomaly, either: Brantley is averaging 20.3 points, 8.1 assists and 
3.4 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Canyon's 80-57 victory Friday over Ridgecrest Burroughs was the 
Cowboys' first in the Burros' gym since 1978. Burroughs, which lost to Saugus 
at home in triple overtime in 1987, has lost just two of its past 59 home 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Records: Royal set a school record Friday with its 15th win of the season, an 
85-63 victory over Channel Islands. The Highlanders (15-3) also set a school 
record with 29 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting: Royal's Jared Byrne, a 6-foot-6 junior, is shooting 61.4% from the 
field and teammate Russell Myers, a 6-5 senior, is shooting 59.1%.. . . . In 
his past three games, Grant forward Setro Terzian has made 20 of 29 field-goal 
attempts. . . . Thousand Oaks converted only nine of 50 field-goal attempts in 
a 61-37 loss to Westlake on Friday. No Lancer had more than two field goals. 
Westlake, meanwhile, made 23 of 43 attempts.

2 O.C. MEN SENTENCED IN SCAM INVOLVING B-1 PARTS 
</P>

<P>
The owner of one of Southern California's largest defense subcontractors and 
one of his employees -- who were both convicted of overcharging the government 
for parts of the B-1 bomber -- were sentenced to prison Tuesday for inventing a 
tax scam to hide those illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kasparoff, 55, of Encino, the owner of two Montebello aerospace firms, 
was sentenced to six months in prison; Harold C. Geyer, 71, of Brea, who was 
Kasparoff's messenger, was ordered imprisoned for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Another man involved in the scheme, Frank Calta, 40, of Orange, was also 
sentenced Tuesday. He received six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi imposed longer sentences on the 
defendants but suspended most of the prison time. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi also imposed a $250,000 fine on Kasparoff and a $20,000 fine on Calta 
and ordered all three to repay delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to the 
Internal Revenue Service, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madison. In 
Kasparoff's case, that could reach $3 million, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax charges sprang from a defense fraud carried out in the mid-1980s at one 
of Kasparoff's companies, Super K, which had a contract with Rockwell 
International to build bulkheads for the B-1. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a federal jury in Los Angeles convicted Kasparoff, Geyer and 
Kasparoff's nephew, John P. Kasparoff of Newport Beach, who was Super K's 
general manager, of overbilling the Air Force by about $1.3 million for two B-1 
bulkheads. The three were placed on probation, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related case in November, Joseph Kasparoff and Geyer pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy and tax fraud in the overbilling scheme. John Kasparoff was not 
named in that case. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983-86, Joseph Kasparoff had Geyer and Calta cash checks from Super K and 
his other firm, J.K. Precision Machining Inc., and return the money to him, 
then he deducted the payments from his taxes as business expenses, Madison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer also prepared phony invoices to back up the checks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The system laundered money that came from Super K's overcharges on the B-1 
contract, Madison said, and it created the impression that Geyer and Calta were 
performing services related to the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Calta, a business acquaintance of Kasparoff, pleaded guilty in October to 
conspiracy for cashing $1 million in checks made out to fictitious third 
parties and returning the money to Kasparoff.

JUDGE DISMISSES STATE FROM LINCOLN SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge has dismissed California from the $250-million lawsuit 
filed by small investors in Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent firm, but he 
gave investors time to file a new complaint against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, in an order released Tuesday, decided that 
the investors who filed the class-action suit after the S&amp;L's collapse in 
April didn't have enough factual allegations to get around the state's claim 
that it is immune from such suits. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the investors have until Jan. 26 to file an amended complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time the suit was filed, we didn't have the facts that we have 
developed since," said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
"We didn't know then the extent of knowledge that the Department of 
Corporations had." 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims the state agency abused its discretion by approving for sale 
debt securities in Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. 
About $200 million in securities were sold at Lincoln's 29 Southern California 
branches to nearly 22,000 small investors, many of them elderly customers who 
mistakenly believed their investments were insured. 
</P>
<P>
The new complaint to be filed, Rus said, will contain allegations that the 
state agency had investigated American Continental's financial condition, 
concluding that it could not repay the debt but approving the sale of the debt 
issue anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has said previously that it relied on a clean bill of health that 
independent auditors gave American Continental and that no state or federal 
S&amp;L regulators had taken any action against Lincoln by the time the debt 
issue was approved in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Pape, a deputy attorney general representing the Corporations 
Department, said that once the amended suit is filed, he will probably ask the 
court again to dismiss it without an opportunity for amending the complaint 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants in the suit include the former operators of Lincoln and the 
lawyers and accountants who advised those operators. 
</P>
<P>
Rus said the immunity issue is a difficult one primarily because there are few 
state Supreme Court decisions that discuss it. The issue in the investors' suit 
may well go to the state's high court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's collapse is expected to become the nation's biggest bailout, costing 
taxpayers an estimated $2 billion.

COMIC RITA RUDNER, APPEARING AT THE LAFF STOP, STUDIED HOW SILENCE SET UP 
BENNY'S PUNCH LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gentle. Subtle. Ethereal. Dainty. Fragile. Demure. 
</P>
<P>
These and similar adjectives regularly show up in articles about comic Rita 
Rudner, whose understated delivery has effectively set her apart from her more 
frenetic counterparts on stand-up comedy stages. 
</P>
<P>
But Rudner, who will perform Thursday at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach, 
insists her soft-spoken approach is no calculated gimmick: "I don't try to be 
quiet. That's me trying to be noisy." 
</P>
<P>
The low-key delivery may be an extension of her own personality, as she says, 
but it also is a reflection of her taste in comics: Jack Benny, Bob Newhart and 
Woody Allen are her personal heroes. Like all three, Rudner is not afraid of 
silence; her perfectly timed pauses give extra firepower to punch lines that 
tick away, like time bombs, behind her whimsical setups. 
</P>
<P>
In one routine, she ponders poodle haircuts, wondering if other dogs assume 
poodles are "in some sort of weird religious cult." And she refuses to buy a CD 
player "until I get something in writing that says that's the last thing 
they're going to invent." Those folks who wander the streets mumbling to 
themselves, Rudner guesses, are the people who bought eight-tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Rudner, 34, delivers her musings on life's small absurdities with little 
physical movement, other than a bemused tilt of the head. The spareness of 
Rudner's physical approach comes as a surprise, considering her background: She 
spent 10 years as a dancer in New York, including work in six Broadway shows 
and several ballet companies. 
</P>
<P>
The dancer's lot -- an endless series of grueling performances and then, when a 
show closes, an endless series of grueling auditions -- became too much. "I 
said, 'Oh, this has to stop,' " Rudner says. "I thought stand-up comedy might 
be good. . . . I could have some control over my life. I could write my own 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Rudner, no former class clown, says she was always "very shy." The choice to 
leave dance and go it alone on stage was mainly business -- the stand-up comedy 
field was uncrowded at the time, about nine years ago. "A couple of years after 
I started," she says, "everybody sort of got the same idea." 
</P>
<P>
She got laughs at her first gig -- unintentional ones, but laughs nonetheless 
-- and started working on her act with a discipline born of her years in dance. 
She says she listened to no music for three or four years, instead playing 
early records by Newhart and Allen over and over and frequenting New York's 
comedy clubs to study the working comics. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a dancer, you have to work at it, because nothing ever comes 
easily," she says. "I think that helps me throughout everything." 
</P>
<P>
The hard work has paid off. She has been featured on two HBO comedy specials, 
"Women of the Night" and "One Night Stand" (the titles led her to muse that the 
next one might be called "Sluts Tell Jokes"), has appeared in her first film 
role and was a regular on the short-lived TV series "George Schlatter's Funny 
People." She also appears frequently on "Late Night With David Letterman" and 
"The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
One reason she entered stand-up comedy, Rudner says, was the chance of meeting 
"funny, witty men." It worked. She has been married for 1 1/2 years to the 
English comedy producer Martin Bergman, who is now her manager. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Rudner tours just one week out of the month, spending much of her 
time writing screenplays with Bergman in their Beverly Hills home. They 
collaborated on one feature film script before tying the knot -- "That's how I 
knew (marriage) would work," she says -- and are working on a second. An 
Australian company is negotiating to produce the first, a comedy about psychics 
called "Medium Rare." 
</P>
<P>
Before getting married, Rudner says, she had to ask herself: "Are you ready to 
give up your single material?" Still, some of the material showcased on the 
latest HBO special centered on the tribulations of finding the right mate: 
</P>
<P>
"The old theory was: Marry an older man, they're more mature," Rudner says. 
"The new theory is: Men don't mature. Marry a young one." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new "married" material centered on the culture clash of marrying a 
man from a different country. Bergman is getting used to having his foibles 
explored in public, Rudner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Rudner performs at 8 and 10 p.m. Thursday at the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. 
Bristol St., Newport Beach. Tickets: $12.50. Information: (714) 852-8762.

DRUG LORDS OFFER A 'DEAL'; 
</P>
<P>
WOULD 'LAY DOWN ARMS' FOR AMNESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A message purporting to be from Colombia's drug lords today declared the 
government the winner in the war on drugs and offered to halt illegal 
activities in exchange for an amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
The communique was given to Patricia Echavarria, who was set free today after 
being kidnaped with her daughter Dec. 16. Echavarria is the wife of a prominent 
doctor in the drug capital of Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the triumph of the state," said the communique from The 
Extraditables, the armed wing of the nation's powerful drug lords. "Thus we 
will lay down our arms and abandon our objectives for the benefit of the 
highest interests of the fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush brushed off the offer by the drug lords. "They've got a 
credibility problem with me," he said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The communique came in response to a call Monday by the Roman Catholic Church 
and political leaders for drug cartels to release their hostages and end drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"We submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of obtaining from 
the government and from society respect for our rights and our return to our 
families and communities," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender the weapons, 
explosives, laboratories, hostages, the clandestine landing strips and other 
effects related to our activities at such a time as we are granted 
constitutional and legal guarantees," the communique continued. 
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared to demand an amnesty that would guarantee the drug 
barons would not face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The Extraditables have previously demanded a full amnesty and an end to 
extraditions of drug suspects to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While President Virgilio Barco Vargas said Tuesday that he would not rule out 
talks with drug traffickers, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said 
Colombian law does not allow an amnesty for common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Barco began his crackdown on the cocaine cartels after the assassination in 
August of a leading presidential candidate. As part of the crackdown, he 
revived an extradition treaty with the United States, which drew up a list of 
the 12 most-wanted drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The Extraditables take their name from the list. 
</P>
<P>
The communique said Echavarria and her daughter, Dina, had been freed as proof 
of the cartels' desire to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
The two were released in a neighborhood built by Medellin cartel leader Pablo 
Escobar Gaviria for the poor people of Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11-point message, The Extraditables said: "We undertake that there will 
be no explosive bombings in any part of the national territory and have ordered 
the suspension of all type of executions of political figures, government and 
labor officials, members of the judiciary, newsmen, policemen and the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
They also offered to act as mediators in efforts to end activities by other 
groups operating outside the law, "for the sole purpose of ending the violence 
which harms and shatters our Colombian fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Colombia has sent 11 drug suspects to the United States to face charges 
but none are on the most-wanted list.

3 KILLED AS TRUCK, VAN COLLIDE ON RAIN-SLICK FREEWAY IN IRVINE

<P>
Three people were killed in an early morning traffic accident today in Irvine 
after their disabled van was rear-ended on the rain-slick Santa Ana Freeway, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 1:15 a.m. today on the Santa Ana Freeway just south 
of Sand Canyon Avenue, California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the driver of the northbound van lost control of the vehicle in the 
heavy rain, Johnson said. "The van struck the right shoulder guard rail and 
came to rest in the No. 2 lane," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A northbound truck traveling in the same lane hit the back of the stalled van, 
killing all three of its occupants, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mark Samsel, 33, of Lakeside, the driver of the mid-size moving truck, 
was unharmed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the van and one of the passengers went through the windshield, 
Johnson said. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, Johnson said. Police 
declined to identify the dead until next of kin could be notified.

ALARM STARTLES SAN CLEMENTE

<P>
Panic-stricken San Clemente residents who mistook an old fire alarm as a 
warning siren from a nearby nuclear power plant jammed emergency telephone 
lines at the police station for 20 minutes late last night. 
</P>
<P>
The fire alarm, located across from the San Clemente police and fire station, 
has been out of service since 1978 and was accidentally tripped about 11:35 
p.m. by high winds and heavy rain, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The loud siren, which can be heard throughout the seaside city of 35,000, was 
once the city's only way to alert its off-duty and volunteer fire crews in an 
emergency, Police Sgt. Richard Downing said. The system was made obsolete when 
fire personnel were issued pagers. 
</P>
<P>
Several emergency sirens for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, located 
five miles south of the city, are set up throughout south Orange County. 
Officials said these sirens were not sounded.

FREEWAY CLOSED AFTER ICE SENDS CARS COLLIDING 
</P>

The Antelope Valley Freeway was briefly closed this morning after snow and ice 
caused 16 accidents, including a 10-car pileup, in less than an hour, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were no serious injuries in any of the accidents, but tangled cars 
littered a five-mile stretch of the freeway from Angeles Forest Highway north 
to Palmdale Boulevard, CHP Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the area where the snow hit hardest," said Siordia, who noted that ice 
conditions were listed as a cause in every accident on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
"We started getting snow at 5:15 a.m. People started crashing by 6," Siordia 
said. "They were driving too fast for the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
By 6:30 a.m. the CHP had reports of 16 separate accidents, four of which 
resulted in injuries, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those accidents involved 10 cars that collided in a chain-reaction 
pileup in the southbound lanes near the Angeles Forest Highway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP shut down all lanes of the four-lane freeway at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"People were driving into the center divider to get around and were getting 
stuck. We had to close it down until the tow trucks could go in and get 
everybody out," Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers began escorting lines of commuters along the freeway at 8 a.m., 
Siordia said. At 9 a.m., after the ice and snow in the area had melted, the 
freeway was completely reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said the accidents and closure made a miserable and long commute for 
many residents heading south to Los Angeles. He explained that the accidents 
occurred during the high point of that commute. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Antelope Valley, our rush hour is an hour earlier than in Los Angeles," 
he said. "It was bumper to bumper when these accidents started happening." 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said the Antelope Valley Freeway is usually closed only once or twice a 
year because of weather conditions.

An abortion protester who faced no more than 30 days in jail but wound up 
spending a year behind bars because he wouldn't give his name was free today, 
his identity still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I think was right," the man, who has identified himself only as 
Baby John Doe, told Judge Randall Nichols at a hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols ordered the protester to pay $12,547 to the county for the cost of 
jailing him. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether his real name might be Gary Christopher -- a name supplied 
by a penal farm guard -- the protester said, "I cannot comment on that, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols agreed to release the man under the names Baby John Doe and Gary 
Christopher, saying his decision was affected by nightly questions from his 
8-year-old son on the protester's fate and letters from all over the United 
States on his behalf.

A man claiming that he had a bomb tried to hijack a jetliner to Cuba but was 
overpowered by a police officer who sneaked up an escape chute after the plane 
made an emergency landing, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously hurt late Tuesday during the America West flight that was 
supposed to fly non-stop from Houston to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 carrying 39 people landed in Austin shortly before midnight, 
after the pilot told the would-be hijacker that the plane needed to refuel, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Robert Martin said the man had been sitting two rows in front of him, 
complaining loudly about American TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the man as Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, a 39-year-old 
Cuban native who lives in New Orleans. FBI Agent Byron Sage said he expected 
the man to be charged with air piracy and kidnaping.

Mayor Raymond Flynn and the media questioned each other about why the fatal 
stabbing of a white college student in a black neighborhood on Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s birthday took until today to make front-page headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Full accounts of the slaying were not published in Boston newspapers until this 
morning because police -- already under fire for their handling of the racially 
charged Carol Stuart murder investigation -- did not provide any details about 
the victim's identity until early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern University sophomore Mark Belmore, 19, was returning from his 
girlfriend's dormitory around 12:25 a.m. Monday when he was attacked and 
stabbed 22 times barely a block from the campus, which borders the racially 
tense Roxbury neighborhood. Investigators were searching for four black 
teen-agers who witnesses said fled the scene.

attempt against her government. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, Bush's deputy national security adviser, left Washington around 
midnight and was to hold talks with Aquino on Thursday. He also will confer 
with Fidel Ramos, the Philippine defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gates will convey Bush's 
"continuing strong commitment to democracy" in the Philippines. He said the 
United States "very strongly" supports the Aquino government and noted that 
Bush ordered air support to help put down a failed coup attempt in December.

The U.S. trade deficit widened in November to $10.5 billion, its worst showing 
in 11 months, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that while imports declined by $593 million to 
$40.69 billion, U.S. exports dropped $843 million to $30.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
The government blamed much of the setback on the Boeing aircraft strike, which 
severely cut into exports of expensive commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Private analysts were still disheartened by the deficit figure. Many had been 
looking for a slight improvement after the sharp deterioration in October. 
</P>
<P>
"The trade report is most distressing," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of 
the Boston Co. "Even accounting for civilian aircraft, U.S. exports are going 
nowhere. The U.S. is simply not competitive on goods." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration was more upbeat in its assessment, with Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher saying officials were still looking for 
"continued moderate improvement in the trade deficit" this year. 
</P>
<P>
The October trade deficit totaled $10.25 billion. Both October and November 
resulted in the worst performance since a $10.8-billion deficit in December, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1989, the U.S. trade deficit ran at an annual rate 
of $111 billion, compared to a deficit of $118.53 billion in all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that America's trade deficit will increase in 1990, 
reversing a two-year trend of improvements. 
</P>
<P>
This is an unsettling forecast for the Bush Administration, which is counting 
on continued growth in exports to bolster the U.S. economy and dampen demands 
in Congress for protectionist trade legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.7% drop in U.S. exports left them at their lowest level since last March. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half of all economic growth in the last two years has been supplied by a 
boom in export sales. But economists are worried that these strong increases 
are in danger of stalling out in 1990, in part because the dollar was rising in 
value most of last year. A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive on 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
On the import side, the 1.4% November decline represented a drop from an 
all-time high set the previous month. Economists said U.S. consumer demand for 
foreign goods is showing little sign of slackening. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the biggest trade deficit in November was with Japan, $4 billion, 
down from $4.9 billion in October. The deficit with members of the Organization 
of Petroleum Exporting Countries totaled $1.8 billion, and the deficit with 
Canada was $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Other large deficits included $1 billion with Taiwan, $800 million with China 
and $700 million with Western Europe.

Domestic oil production in 1989 took the steepest yearly fall in history, and 
petroleum imports rose to a 10-year high, the industry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute, the trade association of the major oil 
companies, also said that while U.S. oil consumption increased only slightly, 
imports rose to 46% of total supplies. 
</P>
<P>
That was the second-highest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
The figures confirm a continued decline of the domestic oil industry and are 
expected to add heat to a debate in Congress this year over whether exploration 
and production companies should get new tax breaks to stimulate drilling 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has argued that declining U.S. oil production and 
increasing reliance on foreign producers is undermining national energy 
security.

Strikes by thousands of auto workers protesting a 10.2% pay increase offer have 
halted production at three of Ford's British plants and have led to the layoffs 
of 10,500 employees, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
As talks resumed between union leaders and Ford Motor Co. Ltd., about 9,000 
employees downed tools for 24 hours or continued indefinite strikes begun 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ford said it was forced to lay off other employees as a result because work 
could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
An engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, engine and final assembly operations at 
Dagenham, east London, and an assembly plant at Halewood, in northwest England, 
were brought to a standstill, Ford said. Production was disrupted at other 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The company estimated that the strikes would cut production by 2,400 vehicles, 
or $15 million a day.

IBM'S EARNINGS TUMBLE 74%

<P>
International Business Machines Corp. today announced that its fourth-quarter 
earnings fell 74%, largely because of previously announced restructuring costs 
aimed at making the world's biggest computer company more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $600 million, or 
$1.04 a share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $3.97 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $20.5 billion, up 2.3% from $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the decline mostly to a previously announced 
$2.4-billion charge against its fourth-quarter results to reflect the expenses 
of restructuring its U.S. business, which has been in a prolonged slump. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader trends in the 
computer business. The company is the largest manufacturer of of information 
processing equipment and systems and is a historical leader in shaping the 
direction of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, IBM said earnings fell 40% to $3.8 billion, or $6.47 a share, 
from $5.8 billion, or $6.47 a share, in 1988. Revenue totaled $62.7 billion, up 
5.1% from $59.7 billion.

WINTER UTILITY USE SPARKS .4% HIKE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION

<P>
Industrial production rose 0.4% in December, the second consecutive monthly 
gain, as unseasonably cold weather fired up output by utilities, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the 6.3% gain in utilities, manufacturing production remained sluggish, 
also partly because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
The slow pace was reflected by the loss of 25,000 factory jobs and an unchanged 
40.7-hour average work week. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, particularly in durable goods -- items such as cars 
and household appliances expected to last more than three years -- has been 
affected by the Federal Reserve Board's tight rein on credit designed to 
curtail inflation because many such items are financed by loans. 
</P>
<P>
In its report today, the board said December's gain in production followed a 
revised 0.3% advance in November, up from the 0.1% reported initially. Output 
had declined 0.4% in October and 0.1% in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The extremely cold weather in December caused a sharp rise in utility output 
but also resulted in some production disruptions, particularly in petroleum 
refining and construction supplies," the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft production returned to normal in December following the settlement of 
a strike" at the Boeing Co., it said. 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the central bank said the operating rate at the nation's 
factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point to 83.3% in December, 
reflecting the increase in the production rate. The operating rate measures 
both output and changes in productivity levels. 
</P>
<P>
The operating report is watched as a barometer of future inflation. The closer 
U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has 
producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases.

A 68-year-old mansion in fashionable Highland Park has been listed for sale by 
Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The asking price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion overlooking Turtle Creek 
is $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The house has marble fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Hunt said in a recent interview that her family intends to move into a 
smaller home. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts were forced to turn over 
holdings valued at more than $220 million. Hunt also had to give up his annual 
salary of $300,000 and income from widespread holdings, the Dallas Times Herald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption for a homestead in 
bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts won't have to give any proceeds from the sale 
to creditors.

The Rhode Island Philharmonic's entire percussion section quit after its leader 
was told he would be fired unless his playing improved. 
</P>
<P>
George Goneconto, a 33-year veteran of the orchestra, said Tuesday he resigned 
rather than fight a notice putting him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
His decision led to the resignations last month of the three other percussion 
members, all former students of the drummer. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Andrew Massey, who sent warning letters to eight members of the 
orchestra at the end of November, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Goneconto said he and Massey had a "friendly discussion" about his performance 
in the fall, and he received the letter soon afterward, which he called a 
"complete shock." 
</P>
<P>
Under the orchestra's contract with the Providence Federation of Musicians, 
players who receive warning letters have until the end of the season to 
improve. They can appeal to a panel of fellow orchestra members, who can 
overrule Massey. 
</P>
<P>
Goneconto, 53, joined the Philharmonic when he was 18 and has been the 
principal percussionist for 30 years.

Princess Anne, daughter of a reigning monarch, says she wishes her children had 
better role models. 
</P>
<P>
"I look around and wonder what sort of examples they have to look up to now," 
the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II told a BBC radio interviewer today. 
</P>
<P>
"That worries me. I don't think there are very many. . . . I think their elder 
generation is to blame for that." 
</P>
<P>
Anne, 39, who separated from her husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, in August, said 
she is not very strict with her 12-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't go along with the 'seen and not heard.' It would be very nice but I 
think it's rather an impractical suggestion really," said the princess. 
</P>
<P>
She said her travels on behalf of the Save the Children fund, of which she is 
president, have made her more concerned about what she sees at home. 
</P>
<P>
"You find if you go to any number of countries where the small rural 
communities have very strict codes of behavior you don't find much thieving and 
pilfering, and murder is almost unheard of," the princess said.

best actress; the play, "Happy Birthday"; and the year, 1947, the first year of 
Tony Awards.

<P>
Other plaques will be placed on sidewalks throughout the theater district, 
rather than in a continuous line like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said Meredith 
Pillon, a Holiday Inn spokeswoman.

Pillon said Tuesday the League of American Theatres and Producers, the American

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS PEDDLE INFLUENCE AS WELL AS PILLS

Is your doctor on the take? Is his office filled with drug company calendars, 
note pads, pens and other mementos labeled with brand names? 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about big-time bribery here, but pharmaceutical promotion may 
have as much effect on people's health as outright influence peddling. 
</P>
<P>
In the highly competitive world of pharmaceuticals, the difference between one 
high blood pressure medicine and another may be slight. Arthritis remedies and 
antibiotics have proliferated, but true advances are few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
To get doctors to prescribe one brand over another, companies spend over $5,000 
per doctor on drug promotion -- over $2 billion a year. This drives up the 
price of prescription medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in medical school, doctors in training receive stethoscopes, books and 
little black bags from company representatives. Meetings and parties for 
medical students and residents may be underwritten by pharmaceutical 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Once in practice, doctors are invited to dinners or sporting events. Some are 
given consulting fees merely for attending meetings at which the merits of a 
particular drug are extolled. Occasionally, doctors are invited to take 
expense-paid vacations in exotic resorts for "continuing medical education." 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have actually paid doctors outright for recruiting patients into 
pseudo-scientific studies -- run not by the research wing of the company, but 
supervised by the sales and marketing department. 
</P>
<P>
As federal spending on basic research has dwindled, the pharmaceutical industry 
has increasing power over research funding. And this power of the purse strings 
gives them other leverage. 
</P>
<P>
It is time American physicians adopted an ethical code similar to that in 
England. British doctors see pharmaceutical reps only on the condition that no 
gift or financial inducement is offered. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when congressmen and government officials have come under increasing 
scrutiny for bribery, doctors need to examine their own ethics.

His singing work in the past has been sporadic. He recorded the cast album to

"This is so wonderful," said the 47-year-old singer. "I just love Red Bay. It's

</P>
<P>
Bolton said the request to rename the highway was in recognition of Wynette's 
contributions to the town, where several of her relatives live. The 1989 
Legislature approved a resolution renaming the road. 
</P>

Wynette, who lives in Nashville, Tenn., held a concert last year to benefit Red

</P>
<P>
TAC, the national governing body for track and athletics based in Indianapolis, 
announced the new policy as part of its year-round, out-of-competition drug 
testing protocol. 
</P>
<P>
TAC officials hope the new policy will prevent athletes from claiming 
retirement to avoid drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
Among the athletes who are eligible for testing are the top 15 performers in 
each event, based on current performance lists. 
</P>
<P>
TAC's new drug testing program began Oct. 2. It calls for the random selection 
of 14 athletes to be tested each week. Any athlete testing positive for the 
first time is suspended from competition for two years.

<P>
Bob Lurie, owner of the San Francisco Giants, told a packed meeting of the City 
Council his team wants to move to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"I am here to tell you directly, formally and publicly that the Giants would 
like to move to Santa Clara," Lurie said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience wore Giants colors and displayed placards in favor of 
moving the National League champions to Santa Clara, about 30 miles south of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie cited fan support, good weather, freeway access and plentiful parking as 
assets in favor of moving to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lurie said after the meeting that he plans to continue talks with 
cities around the country in case the Santa Clara plan falls through, the City 
Council voted unanimously to explore the costs of locating the team here. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco voters narrowly defeated a ballot measure last November that 
would have approved the building of a new downtown ballpark. Lurie had said a 
new park is necessary for the Giants to stay in San Francisco. The team now 
plays at Candlestick Park.

<P>
A judge has fined New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield $10,000 for failing 
to disclose a California bank account during the pretrial phase of divorce 
proceedings from his common-law wife. 
</P>
<P>
A jury last summer found that Winfield had a common-law marriage to flight 
attendant Sandra Renfro from 1982 to 1985, and a judge ordered him to pay 
temporary alimony and child support for the couple's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Allen Daggett Tuesday postponed the Winfield-Renfro 
divorce hearing until the issue of the California bank account is settled. 
Winfield holds the joint account with his current wife, Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
Daggett ordered Winfield to submit all documentation pertaining to the account 
to Renfro's attorney, Earle Lilly. The judge also sanctioned Winfield to pay 
Renfro $10,000.

<P>
The Maxwell Football Club today named San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana 
winner of the 31st annual Bert Bell award as the year's outstanding 
professional football player. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Maxwell Club, Pro Writers Assn., representatives of the National 
Football League teams and Philadelphia-area sportswriters gave Montana 1,638 
points, far ahead of 234 points for Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Three points were awarded for each first-place vote, two points for each second 
and one point for each third. 
</P>
<P>
Montana got 90% or 516 of the 573 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders got nine first-place votes, while Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski 
and Seattle wide receiver Steve Largent got eight first-place votes each. Last 
year's Bert Bell winner, Randall Cunningham, got seven first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
The award is based on the regular season, during which Montana completed 70.2% 
or 271 of his 386 pass attempts. He threw for 3,521 yards or 9.12 yards per 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six of his passes were for touchdowns and he threw eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Montana is due to receive the award Feb. 20 in Philadelphia.

BRONCOS' TIMING-NOT THEIR TALENT -- IS PRETTY LOUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was hard not to feel a twinge of sympathy for the Denver Broncos even as 
they celebrated their third American Football Conference championship in four 
years after dispatching the Cleveland Browns Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They were proud of making it back to the Super Bowl, and rightfully so. Two 
consecutive Super Bowl blowouts, the second against the Washington Redskins in 
1988, had forced them to look hard in the mirror and change their ways. Almost 
everything about them, from coaching staff to style of defense, had been 
overhauled. It was not easy. The Broncos went 8-8 in the 1988 season and failed 
to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But now, just a year later, they were back in the Super Bowl. And in their 
locker room Sunday the talk was that this year would be different, no Orange 
Crushed headlines the day after the Super Bowl. They were painfully earnest 
about all this and had worked hard to recover their pride. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they spoke, however, the San Francisco 49ers were stamping out the Rams 
with such ferocity that women and children cowered from coast to coast. The 
score in the National Football Conference championship game was 30-3, and the 
Rams were on their knees begging for their lives at the end, or so went the 
inside scoop. 
</P>
<P>
The poor Broncos. Their timing is just plain poor. Had they made their return 
to the Super Bowl a year ago, when the 49ers were more vulnerable, they 
probably would not have taken another mega-beating. The Cincinnati Bengals, if 
you recall, were in the game all the way before a last-minute 49ers touchdown 
beat them. These Broncos are as capable as those Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's edition of the 49ers is many lengths superior. They lost only 
two games, as opposed to five a year ago. Their underrated defense has been 
particularly nettlesome. And, of course, Joe Montana is having a remarkable 
season: his best; one against which all great quarterbacking seasons may be 
compared. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos just do not compare. It is true they have a more balanced offense 
and more physical defense than both of their Super losers, but they still are 
overmatched against these 49ers. Fact is, the 11 1/2-point betting line is too 
little. Not that that is an insult. No team in the parity-puffed, watered-down 
National Football League could stay within two touchdowns of the 49ers right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
So it comes down to this: The Broncos, after all their soul-searching and 
reconstruction, are facing yet another paddling. Those who believe in justice 
had best avert their eyes. The Broncos' lot in life, it appears, is to be the 
well-paid, genial foil, the team that achieves much but, in the end, serves 
primarily as a pillow other teams kick and stomp as final proof of their 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that one thing in the Broncos' favor is their motivation. 
Not in years has a Super Bowl qualifier stimulated such disrespect. The Broncos 
will play for the legitimacy of their name, and teams in such position play 
hard and, often, well. So maybe they have a chance if Montana falls off a train 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' window of opportunity is, simply, a peephole. It is important to 
understand the powerful sweep against which they are bucking. If not for one 
poor game in January, 1988, the 49ers would be on the verge of their third 
consecutive Super Bowl championship and their fourth in six years. It could be 
time to bring out the D-word: Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons ago, the 49ers finished the regular season with a 14-2 record that 
included 41-0 and 48-0 shatterings of the Rams and Chicago Bears in the last 
three weeks. But, inexplicably, they did not show up against the Minnesota 
Vikings in the playoffs, giving a four-loss Redskins team the chance to batter 
the Broncos. The Redskins won fair and square but they were not the best team 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers rebounded to win the Super Bowl last year after a tumultuous regular 
season during which they lost five of their first 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the pieces fit perfectly. Montana is healthy now, and the nucleus of 
players has been together four or five years. The latter makes a big 
difference; the 49ers' combination of talent, teamwork and experience is just 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Cleveland's receivers get open so easily against Denver in the AFC 
championship, one could not help imagining what damage the 49ers' Jerry Rice, 
John Taylor and Roger Craig could inflict if set loose in those open fields. 
Perhaps the only defense that could stop such a passing game is the 49ers' 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that would be worth watching. Let's say we pool our resources -- if every 
fan who watched the game contributed a dollar, we would have $120 million -- 
and buy the Super Bowl and give it to the 49ers. (Final: 34-14.) We would be 
spared another Bronco-bashing, and, instead, we could hold Super Scrimmage I. 
Jerry Rice against Ronnie Lott. That would be super.

STEWARDS NULLIFY A MURKY VICTORY AT LOUISIANA TRACK

It was a foggy day when Landing Officer sprinted to a 20-length victory on a 
foggy track at Delta Downs, and racing officials think the race was a bit 
murky, so they nullified the result. 
</P>
<P>
Some stewards think jockey Sylvester Carmouche hid the 5-year-old horse in the 
fog and waited for the rest of the pack to approach before exploding to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Landing Officer was disqualified after last Thursday's 11th race by racing 
stewards at the western Louisiana track. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a question in my mind whether he won or not," said Clyde Stevens, a 
racing steward. "I also have a question of where he was during the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens refused to comment on whether Carmouche hid Landing Officer in the fog, 
saying, "That's under litigation." 
</P>
<P>
He said a state Racing Commission inquiry is scheduled Thursday into 
Carmouche's actions. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was so bad that the track announcer stopped calling the races. 
</P>
<P>
J. L. Vincent, track security director, told the Houston Chronicle that 
Carmouche could have hidden in the fog at the top of the stretch, waiting for 
the field to approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to hide at the top of the stretch down there because 
the fog was so thick," Vincent said. "That's what we think happened because, 
when the horses came by the first time, we counted only eight, and there were 
nine starters." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said two jockeys filed protests immediately after the race.

Glasnost has come to golf. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Soviet teen-agers began a tour of the United States Monday that will 
include two weeks at the PGA School in South Florida for some intensified 
instruction from pros like Doug Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
How much will it help their game? 
</P>
<P>
"They've been playing for one year and their handicap is 18," said Sven Tumba, 
who built the first golf course in the Soviet Union. "They learn fast." 
</P>
<P>
Tumba is the ex-Swedish hockey player who spent a decade selling golf to the 
Soviets. "Their hockey players would come to Sweden and I would tell them, 'Why 
don't you play golf? This is a beautiful game.' 
</P>
<P>
"Always the answer was 'Nyet.' I think they saw it as a capitalist sport." 
</P>
<P>
Tumba did not give up, though. He kept after Soviet sports authorities and 
eventually got clearance to construct a course. The first spade of dirt was 
turned April 24, 1988. "That is the birthday of Soviet golf," Tumba said. 
Eighteen months later, last October, the Tumba Golf Club opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-hole layout sits on what was a downtown dump, a patch of green in the 
heart of Moscow, about 20 minutes from the Kremlin. It was constructed around a 
lake -- "I used a dog leg, par-5 to go around it," Tumba said -- and plays to a 
par-34. The last hole's green sits on an island. There is room on the other 
side of the lake for another nine holes. It is a start. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Tumba needed players. Corporate memberships for visiting businessmen cost 
$20,000 but he wanted Soviet players. So he turned to surrounding area schools. 
Spalding supplied several thousand golf balls and Tumba's program was under 
way. "You have to start somewhere," he said. "We started with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
About 250 Soviet youngsters took clubs to balls and began learning the basics 
of the sport, first in school gymnasiums, later on the driving range next to 
Tumba's course. The only problem was the balls kept disappearing because the 
proletariat had never seen these things before and they made dandy souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
From the first class of players, Tumba and the Soviet sports authorities 
selected 10 to travel to the United States. There are ambitious plans for 
future student exchanges -- 100 Soviet youngsters coming to America to learn 
golf one summer, 100 Americans traveling to the Soviet Union for instruction in 
other sports, perhaps hockey or soccer, the following year.
