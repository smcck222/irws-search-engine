BUSH WOULD PRESS A-ARMS TALKS, BAKER TELLS SENATORS

James A. Baker III, President-elect Bush's choice for secretary of state, told 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday that the new Administration 
hopes to resume nuclear arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union this year 
without waiting for results from negotiations on conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The President-elect has made it very clear that he wants to build upon the 
progress that has been made to date in the START negotiations," Baker said, 
referring to the strategic arms reduction talks, which were suspended last 
year. "But we do want to review the bidding. We want to take sufficient time to 
do it right." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, in a day of hearings on his upcoming nomination as secretary of state, 
suggested that he favors resumption of the talks as soon as the new 
Administration reviews its negotiating positions and its plans for new nuclear 
weapons systems. He dismissed reports that some Bush advisers want to delay 
negotiations for as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that you'll see President-elect Bush adopting a leisurely 
approach to this," Baker told the committee. "We want to build on the progress 
that's been made; we think it's been constructive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody is suggesting a yearlong review," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's comments, in response to questions from several senators, appeared to 
reflect a quiet policy debate among Bush advisers even before the new 
President's inauguration on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Scowcroft, Bush's choice to be national security adviser, has suggested 
to the President-elect that he be cautious in resuming arms control 
negotiations, aides said. Baker, on the other hand, "would like to have a START 
agreement wrapped up in time for the 1990 (congressional) elections," a 
Scowcroft partisan said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baker told the senators: "It's difficult for me to give you a date for 
resumption of START negotiations, since this is a decision that the President 
will make, after he becomes President, on the advice of myself and others." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said also that he favors going ahead with nuclear arms talks without 
waiting to see whether progress is reached in East-West negotiations on 
non-nuclear armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be my thought that we should move forward . . . initially, at least, 
with the START negotiations without necessarily linking them to anything else," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks Set for March 
</P>
<P>
A new set of negotiations on conventional forces in Europe is scheduled to 
begin in March, and some Bush advisers reportedly suggested delaying nuclear 
arms talks until some progress was apparent on the non-nuclear front. 
</P>
<P>
In a long opening statement and in his answers to questions, Baker offered no 
foreign policy surprises. Instead, he stressed continuing the basic principles 
of the Reagan Administration's foreign policy, coupled with a more pragmatic 
approach to individual issues and a more conciliatory attitude toward Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He promised to consult frequently with lawmakers on foreign policy issues and 
asked for more bipartisan cooperation from Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler Congress," he said, borrowing 
from Bush's campaign promise of a "kinder, gentler nation." 
</P>
<P>
In return, both Republicans and Democrats extravagantly praised him -- from 
archconservative Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who declared Baker to be "uniquely 
qualified," to archliberal Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who pronounced his 
appointment "stellar." 
</P>
<P>
So clear was the unanimity of Baker's support that the panel's chairman, Sen. 
Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), scheduled a vote on confirming his nomination for 
Thursday morning -- at least 25 hours before Bush, as the newly inaugurated 
President, can formally make the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the senators that he and Bush both support the "Reagan Doctrine," 
the policy under which the United States provided military aid to 
anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the new Administration's intention to continue military aid to 
anti-government rebels in Angola until "national reconciliation" is negotiated 
there. But he said bluntly that the Reagan Administration's policy of relying 
on the Contras in Nicaragua "hasn't worked, because we haven't had a unified 
United States behind it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he suggested a two-track approach in Central America: first, pursuing 
U.S. goals there "through diplomacy and negotiation," and second, continuing 
non-military aid to the Contras -- with a possible request for military aid 
later. 
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. goals in Nicaragua should continue to include "movement 
toward democracy and respect for human rights" as well as national security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Baker: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Acknowledged that the global debt plan he promoted as Treasury secretary is 
not working and called for a major review of the issue, which could include 
discussion of "a creative financing mechanism" to reduce Third World debt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Suggested that he will seek a new U.S. approach to South Africa, where, he 
said, American economic sanctions have failed to push the white regime toward 
dismantling its policy of official racism. "We ought to consider perhaps some 
creative ways to build black institutions in South Africa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said that the Bush Administration will maintain economic sanctions against 
Panama "unless there's movement" by the country's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, toward relinquishing power. And he suggested that the United States 
might delay its approval of a Panamanian administrator for the Panama Canal, 
due in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said that the United States will recognize whatever government takes power 
in El Salvador after presidential elections in March, as long as the vote is 
"free and fair and in the best democratic tradition." At the same time, he 
suggested that the Bush Administration will quickly warn the Salvadoran 
government and armed forces that a renewed wave of murders by death squads 
linked to the military would endanger U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Praised the government of Mexico for "a good faith effort" to halt drug 
trafficking and said he is optimistic "that they are going to make greater good 
faith efforts."

DRIFTER HAD A FONDNESS FOR FIREARMS

SANDY, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sparse portrait that emerged of Patrick Edward Purdy in the hours following 
his assault at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif., was that of a 
young man who was troubled by his father's early, violent death, had a poor 
relationship with his mother and was struggling to master a trade. 
</P>
<P>
He had a fondness for firearms too, including what his aunt called "a big old 
ugly gun" that he bought last August while he was staying with her in tiny 
Sandy: a Chinese-made AK-47 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Since last fall, Purdy, who was born in Pierce, Wash., had rambled across the 
country in search of work. He had been laid off from a job in Oregon after 
attending welding school there. He told his aunt that the Boilermakers Union 
had told him there was a job in Dallas, but when he got there, the job had 
disappeared. He went to Memphis but hated the city and struck out for 
Cincinnati, where through the union he got another welding job. 
</P>
<P>
It might not have been steady work, but it seemed an improvement from the life 
he had been living before, drifting between motels and boarding houses in 
Stockton and the nearby cities of Lodi and Modesto and using as a mailing 
address the modest, brown-stucco home in Lodi where his grandmother, Julie 
Chumbley, lives. Chumbley had not seen Purdy since last June and had not heard 
from him since Christmas, when he sent her a holiday card from Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's traveled the whole country since he was a teen-ager," said a family 
friend, who was turning away reporters who came to Chumbley's door after 
Stockton police identified Purdy as the man who shot 35 people and then 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton police said Tuesday night that they were still groping for a motive. 
Most of what the small, slender man with short, dirty-blond hair had done with 
his life seemed like so much small change. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested him for soliciting a prostitute in Los Angeles in 1980. Two 
years later, when he was again living here, he was arrested on a 
hashish-selling charge. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Beverly Hills police arrested him on a charge of possessing a 
dangerous weapon. The type of weapon was not listed in Purdy's rap sheet, but 
he was sentenced only for a misdemeanor and drew probation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when he was living in Woodland, Calif., east of Sacramento, Purdy was 
arrested again on a robbery charge and convicted of being an accessory. Until 
Tuesday, that was the last crime for which he was arrested, according to 
California and Oregon authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird," said his aunt, Julie Michael, in an interview on the front porch 
of her duplex in Sandy, 25 miles east of Portland. "Nobody really knows why. Do 
you think anybody ever will? It's like a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy's father was killed when a car struck him on a dark street about five 
years ago, and the young man did not get along well with his mother, who has 
since remarried. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he had camped out . . . while he was trying to go to school 
(in California) and make it on his own, because his mom had spent his Social 
Security money," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined Union 
</P>
<P>
But Michael said Purdy, whom she described as intelligent, "was real happy with 
his life," especially after joining the Boilermakers Union. Although police in 
Stockton described him as having had a drinking problem, Michael said that when 
he lived at her home last summer, he did not take drugs or drink excessively. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the manner of wanderers with criminal records, Purdy used aliases and 
fuzzed the details of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He identified himself as Eddie Purdy West to the California Department of Motor 
Vehicles, and he said his birth date was 1962. He told the Oregon DMV he was 
two years younger. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton police said he stood 5 feet, 7 inches tall, but Purdy listed his 
height as 5-feet, 11 inches when he registered with Oregon and California motor 
vehicle authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, when he decided to go to Oregon to stay with his aunt and uncle and 
look for work, Purdy answered a newspaper ad for a cheap 1977 station wagon, 
the one he would park just outside the elementary school gate Tuesday before 
setting it afire and walking 50 yards across the school grounds to begin firing 
his semiautomatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression was that he was just a typical drifter," said Michael Fitzer, a 
Stockton engineer who sold Purdy the car. "He spent about an hour looking at 
the car. I would ask him a question, he would answer. He didn't say a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asking $700, we agreed on $500. He said, 'If you want the money, you'll 
have to come with me.' We went to one bank, he drew out $300, then we went to a 
check-cashing company, and he cashed a check for the other $200." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzer heard Purdy's name on the radio driving home from work Tuesday. The name 
sounded familiar but he could not place it. When he walked in the door, his 
wife told him newspaper reporters had been telephoning. Then he remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I got scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, looking back, Fitzer found it impossible to imagine that the young man in 
a white T-shirt and tight blue jeans would explode the way he did. 
</P>
<P>
Nor could Pat Thomas, who shared a duplex with Purdy's aunt and uncle in Sandy 
and met him last summer after Purdy left the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't seem like any kind of violent person," Thomas said in what has 
become the most unfortunate cliche of massacre postscripts. "He just seemed 
like a normal young man."

<TEXT>
<P>
A second day of racial violence Tuesday left at least eight people shot, one 
fatally, and dozens of stores burned and looted. 
</P>
<P>
Plumes of smoke soared above the predominantly black neighborhoods of Overtown 
and Liberty City, darkening the eye of a municipal face that so badly wanted to 
look good for Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead there showed the ugly lines of racial tension. More than 230 people 
were arrested as police moved in convoys of officers -- called field forces -- 
trying to keep a serious disturbance from erupting further. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities told law-abiding citizens to remain indoors as they began the 
block-by-block sweep. 
</P>
<P>
The violent outbreak was sparked by the fatal shooting Monday night of an 
unarmed black motorcyclist by a Latino policeman. A second man on the 
motorcycle died Tuesday from injuries suffered when the motorcycle hit a car. 
</P>
<P>
All day Tuesday, community leaders walked the boulevards, urging residents to 
be calm. 
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen regardless of race to stay 
calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes," Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez 
said in a televised appeal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police blockaded entire neighborhoods from outsiders, but the cork would not 
stay on the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The first shooting took place in the early afternoon when a crowd heaved rocks 
at the white driver of a luxury car in Overtown. As he sped away, the man 
pulled a gun and fired into the crush. Derrick Mitchell, 19, was hit. He 
remained hospitalized in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
After dark, seven others were shot, authorities said, though details remained 
sketchy and sometimes changing. An alleged looter was shot in Liberty City by 
police, as was an alleged sniper. A 7-year-old girl was wounded in the leg by 
stray gunfire, police said. Liberty City is several miles northwest of 
Overtown. 
</P>
<P>
A Miami policeman, Eric Butler, was struck with birdshot, but his bullet-proof 
vest blunted the impact and he was not seriously injured. His alleged assailant 
was later arrested atop a three-story building. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 p.m., a young black man was fatally shot in the head amid the Liberty 
City violence. Police quickly made an arrest, but were unsure how, or even if, 
the crime fit in to the racial melee. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day authorities tried different tactics. Often, they left angry 
crowds alone as long as damage was small. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, outnumbered officers watched helplessly as looters walked off with 
items as large as sofas and coffee tables. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally tear gas was used to disperse people. Sometimes the crowd struck 
back, hurling anything they could find. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay taxes for police protection!" one angry man shouted at police. "And all 
I end up doing is paying killers who kill people!" 
</P>
<P>
A TV news van also was attacked. Its crew cowered as the glass around them 
shattered. Several motorists had their windshields knocked in by rocks as they 
slowed on expressway exit ramps. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after nightfall, Police Chief Perry Anderson announced that enough 
was enough. "We've been very tolerant. We've allowed the emotional to take 
place . . . and now it's time to bring the city back to order." 
</P>
<P>
The field forces plunged in. Arrests multiplied. People scattered. 
</P>
<P>
But still -- as midnight passed -- order was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Local merchants dug in for all-night vigils, guarding businesses on streets 
where it is impossible to get insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Police saved grocer Ahmed Dabas, trapped by gunfire for two hours in his store. 
"The people were shouting, 'We're going to get you, white man,' " Dabas said. 
"They would have . . . killed us if it weren't for (police)." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began Monday evening in Overtown after a Latino policeman, William 
Lozano, shot at two men on a motorcycle, killing the driver. Killed was Clement 
Lloyd, 23, part owner of a car wash and a black well-known in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, angry crowds began accusing the police of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about why the shooting occurred -- and how police handled the 
following disturbance -- have since vexed the city and fueled the rage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Open Season Against Blacks' 
</P>
<P>
Prominent ministers are among the incensed. "The people believe it's open 
season against blacks," said the Rev. Carleton Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Justice Department announced it had opened a civil rights 
investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI is on the scene, and with them there, we are confident there will be a 
thorough and complete investigation," said department spokesman Mark Weaver in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Suarez made similar promises. Late Tuesday, he said he would ask the City 
Commission to name an independent review panel of private citizens to look into 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez met Tuesday with black leaders and residents of Overtown, a neighborhood 
of run-down apartment buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, Lozano, 29, was on foot, taking a report from a 
crime victim, when he heard a radio report that another officer was pursuing a 
motorcycle for a speeding violation. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle coming in his 
direction," police spokesman Angelo Bitsis said. "As the motorcycle either 
approached him or went by him, he fired his shot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4-Year Police Veteran 
</P>
<P>
Police have made no statement about whether the department believes the force 
used was justified. Lozano is a 4-year veteran of the force with several 
commendations. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet struck Lloyd in the back of the head, then his motorcycle slammed 
into an oncoming Buick. It was the gunshot that killed him, an autopsy showed. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died Tuesday from massive head injuries 
sustained in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
As both men were removed in ambulances Monday, Suarez walked through Overtown, 
trying to speak with Lloyd's mother and calm things down. 
</P>
<P>
He was chased off amid the first barrage of rocks and bottles. Police in riot 
gear then moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
That action -- the appearance of so many policemen in full battle garb -- 
infuriated the already angry crowd, many black civic leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
"The riot gear alone is enough to incite the people," said Annie Adker, a 
longtime Overtown activist. 
</P>
<P>
For Miami boosters, the unrest came at the worst possible time, just prior to 
Sunday's championship Super Bowl XXIII game between the San Francisco 49ers and 
the Cincinnati Bengals -- even though Joe Robbie Stadium is miles from any of 
the street violence. 
</P>
<P>
The evening news on Miami television stations dealt as much with how the 
disturbances were hurting Miami's image, as how much they simply hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The racial violence breaks years of respite from such unrest. Miami had a 
serious riot in 1980, when 18 were killed. There were also disturbances in 1982 
and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The relative harmony belied the grim fact that not much has changed for black 
Miami, where average income is about half that of whites and the jobless rate 
exceeds the overall average by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentment Against Latinos 
</P>
<P>
Johnnie R. McMillian, president of the local chapter of the NAACP, said Tuesday 
that blacks are upset with the changing demographics of the community, where 
they feel they continually lose out in the job market to Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"The African-Americans have felt cheated," she said. "We felt we were losing 
our place in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are also upset with the treatment of Haitian refugees -- who are often 
stopped at sea or, if they succeed in getting ashore, placed in detention 
camps. Other alien groups have fared better. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Nicaraguans -- most of them penniless -- recently have arrived in 
Miami. The city has turned its baseball stadium into a temporary shelter for 
them, and there has been an outpouring of private donations. 
</P>
<P>
"They interdict the Haitians at sea . . . and they meanwhile offer the 
red-carpet treatment to Nicaraguans," said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, an 
activist priest in the Haitian community. 
</P>
<P>
The Overtown neighborhood itself has declined in recent years. It was once a 
proud, vibrant community, the center of night life for black Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the 1940s, thousands of people were removed for a proposed urban 
renewal program. But the main construction was not houses, but an expressway 
that cut the neighborhood in two. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, plans to erect new buildings usually have nothing to do with 
residents and much to do with powerful business interests. 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of Overtown is a brand new structure that city boosters view with 
boundless pride -- a basketball arena, home to the NBA's Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
An hour before Tuesday's scheduled tip-off against the Phoenix Suns, the city 
canceled the game. The danger was too great.

BUNDY LOSES HIGH COURT APPEAL; FLORIDA SETS EXECUTION FOR TUESDAY

<P>
Theodore Bundy, the serial killer called "a diabolical genius" by one judge, 
faces death in Florida's electric chair next week after losing a Supreme Court 
appeal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected arguments that Bundy, 42, was mentally 
incompetent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying of a 12-year-old girl 
in Lake City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour of the court's action, Florida officials said Bundy would be 
executed next Tuesday morning under a death warrant signed by Gov. Bob 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy also has received death sentences for the 1978 killings of two Florida 
State University sorority sisters who were beaten and strangled three weeks 
before the Lake City murder. He has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or 
disappearances of young women, most of them in Utah, Colorado and Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's order marked the fourth time that the Supreme Court has considered a 
formal appeal involving one of his convictions or death sentences. 
</P>

CABINET-LEVEL UNIT ON RIGHTS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT BY FORMER OFFICIALS SEEKS COMMITMENT FROM BUSH

Citing what it called a "complete breakdown" of civil rights enforcement under 
the Reagan Administration, a group of former government civil rights officials 
Tuesday urged President-elect Bush to create a Cabinet-level task force to 
examine discrimination in housing, employment and education. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the private Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights said that Bush 
should display his commitment to "a kinder, gentler nation" by taking direct 
action on civil rights in his first 100 days in office. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last eight years, hope in the lives of minorities has been replaced by 
despair," said commission Chairman Arthur Flemming, who was secretary of 
health, education and welfare during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration. 
"Martin Luther King talked about 'the urgency of now,' and that is applicable 
to the situation that exists today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 on Panel 
</P>
<P>
The panel was composed of 15 former government officials who have been involved 
in civil rights issues. Members included former Secretary of Labor Ray 
Marshall; former Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson; William H. Brown III, former 
Equal Opportunity Commission chairman; and Father Theodore H. Hesburgh, 
president emeritus of Notre Dame University and former chairman of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The group's criticism follows similar harsh words about Reagan's civil rights 
record by former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and several 
other black leaders. Reagan and the Justice Department have sharply disputed 
the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Flemming, describing his panel's concerns in a press conference, said that the 
establishment of a new civil rights task force led by Cabinet secretaries would 
help the new Administration "come to grips" with what he said is a widespread 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan years, he charged, the Administration opposed measures that 
would have advanced civil rights and also failed to enforce laws that already 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s have left a legacy of confusion about the commitment of the federal 
government to carry through with the promise of equality of opportunity," the 
report says. It adds that there has been "persistent discrimination" in the 
United States in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
With millions of instances of housing discrimination occurring each year, the 
report says, an average of only 10 new cases have been filed annually by the 
Justice Department since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that only 22 equal employment cases were referred to the 
federal government in 1986, down from 269 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the last eight years, you are almost appalled," said 
commission member Brown. "The Justice Department (has) been whittling away at 
the hard won victories of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Mark Weaver said that criticism of the 
department's civil rights performance "boggles the mind. They are not looking 
at the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver said that enforcement of civil rights legislation has been happening in 
"record numbers" and said that it is an area the department is "most proud of." 
</P>
<P>
He added that individual cases brought by the department in the last eight 
years have affected thousands of people. As an example, Weaver noted a voting 
rights case pending against Los Angeles County in August. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of housing discrimination and equal employment cases 
filed has been low because the department does not have jurisdiction to file 
cases on behalf of individuals, but rather, only when there is a large pattern 
of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Flemming said that more aggressive action is needed to curb discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Reagan's assertion last weekend that some civil rights leaders 
may be exaggerating the extent of discrimination to further their own careers, 
Flemming said, "This is why we have . . . the kind of dismal record of the last 
eight years." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "60 Minutes" Sunday night, Reagan said that unnamed black 
leaders "are doing very well" by "keeping alive the feeling that they're the 
victims of prejudice."

Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, says that all state institutions, 
including the "security apparatus" and the nation's news agency, will be 
abolished this year. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Monday night that was broadcast by Libyan Television, Kadafi said 
it is the people who should rule. 
</P>
<P>
"All the institutions which are traditionally considered as state institutions 
are to be abolished," he said in a speech to a grass-roots political committee. 
</P>
<P>
Tripoli-based diplomats contacted by telephone expressed skepticism over 
Kadafi's promises, pointing out that he promised to disband the army and police 
last September but that both institutions still exist. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kadafi said the nation's security apparatus must be eliminated 
"because complaints are mounting against it and its violations are on the 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
He described the official news agency Jana as "a huge octopus with hundreds of 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi has said he seeks a political system in which people run the country 
without parties or government bodies.

LIBYA PLANT POISONS U.S.-BONN TIES; 
</P>
<P>
W. GERMANS SEEN AS INSENSITIVE TO CONCERNS OVER FACILITY 
</P>

<P>
The row over West German companies' involvement in building a controversial 
chemical plant in Libya has soured Bonn-Washington relations more than any 
event since Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted that President Reagan visit the 
military cemetery at Bitburg in April, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This was the general impression shared Tuesday by diplomats, political 
observers and editorialists as the Bundestag (Parliament) prepared to debate 
the affair at a session today. 
</P>
<P>
And the scandal over the Libyan plant, which the United States says is designed 
to make chemical weapons while Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, maintains 
it is for pharmaceuticals, is considered by many to be the most serious during 
Kohl's six years as chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl had publicly criticized the U.S. government and media for making an issue 
of alleged West German commercial help for the Libyan project, saying that 
German investigations had not corroborated what inadequate evidence the 
Americans had offered. Then he was embarrassed when West German officials 
admitted that they had come up with evidence of involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more mystifying because it was all so unnecessary," commented 
one editor, noted for his conservative views. "The government could have said, 
'Yes, we have a problem with these chemical companies. Let's attend to it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, they bumbled, denied the facts, temporized, became legalistic and 
then admitted the Americans were right -- that West German firms were connected 
with the Libyan complex, and it was intended for poison gas. This all shows 
Kohl at his insensitive worst." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has not been helped by his chief spokesman, the stolid, pipe smoking 
Friedhelm Ost, whose phlegmatic about-faces have added to the skepticism shown 
by a wide range of critics over government policy on the Libyan issue. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, for instance, Ost said the regular Kohl Cabinet 
meeting had not discussed the controversy, and when asked why not, responded 
testily: 
</P>
<P>
"I do not have to explain why they didn't. I don't have to explain why they 
didn't discuss the mild winter." 
</P>
<P>
One veteran journalist walked away from the conference declaring, "I don't 
think these people realize how serious this is -- how people in the U.S. and 
elsewhere are reacting to the news that the Germans are again engaged in 
manufacturing poison gas." 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher believe the flap over 
West German complicity in building a poison gas factory for the erratic Kadafi 
can jeopardize his energetic foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Genscher is trying to sell the rest of the world on an absolute ban on 
chemical weapons," said one associate, "and now everyone can point the finger 
at West Germany and say: 'What are you up to with these chemicals?' " 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democratic Party has seized on the opportunity to 
castigate Kohl and his colleagues for their insensitivity on the issue, just as 
they did in 1985 at Bitburg, when the chancellor insisted that Reagan visit a 
military cemetery even after it was discovered that Nazi SS (elite force) 
troops were buried there. 
</P>
<P>
Social Democrat leader Hans-Jochen Vogel charged the government with "leading 
the public around by the nose" and purveying "untruths and deceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel declared that Kohl's handling of the Libyan affair was damaging the 
traditional close links with Washington, at a time when large segments of West 
German public opinion are questioning traditional ties with the Atlantic 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Intolerable' Thought 
</P>
<P>
"With our past in mind," said Vogel, "the very thought that a West German 
government has tolerated or even connived in the production of poison gas that 
could be used against Israel is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
The West German national media, at first echoing Kohl's statements that the 
West German chemical companies were simply victims of Washington's rash and 
unproven charges, have abashedly now lined up almost unanimously against his 
position -- and expressed the fear that it could harm relations with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Many editorialists criticized Kohl for his excessively legalistic approach to 
the charges that German firms like Imhausen-Chemie were involved in the 
chemical plant when he said more proof was needed, as in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
"Kohl speaks and acts as though he were not the head of government but a judge 
in the high court," commented the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. "Because he has lost 
political control of the Imhausen scandal, he keeps repeating the formula about 
proof which can be used in court." 
</P>
<P>
And the Munich paper's respected foreign editor, Josef Joffe, commented: 
"What's going on between Bonn and Washington? Kohl should have realized when 
first being presented with the information during his visit to the U.S. that 
Washington by no means wanted to publicly compromise the Germans, let alone to 
accuse them. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonn's actions do not demonstrate greater self-confidence, as the departing 
U.S. ambassador to the federal republic, Richard R. Burt, recently stated. The 
shrill tone revealed old reflex reactions that appeared to have been long 
overcome: whininess, paranoia and aggressiveness, as they used to surface in 
the past whenever the Germans felt prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
And calling attention to how newspapers had at first been deluded by Kohl's 
statements, commentator Georg Streiter wrote in the Hamburger Morgenpost: "We 
were willing to join Kohl and his friends in their bitching about the evil 
Americans who were making us look impossible with their allegedly hair-raising 
and unjustified accusations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enough Potential Friction 
</P>
<P>
"Now we look even more impossible. All those of us who issued the big denials 
will now have to eat their words, one by one. And what about us? 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to sink into the ground: once again the Germans, once again 
weapons, and, on top of it all, once again poison gas." 
</P>
<P>
That Kohl let the controversy with the United States over the Libyan chemical 
plant get out of control worries many pro-American Germans. 
</P>
<P>
They point out that there is enough potential friction with the United States 
anyway: the row over the European Community's decision to ban American 
hormone-fed meat; an upcoming decision on modernizing short-range nuclear 
weapons; plans to curb low-level military training flights, which are dangerous 
and highly unpopular in the countryside, and differing views on developing 
relations with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
As one respected official, both a conservative and a friend of America, put it 
Tuesday: "Part of the fault lies in that we Germans have become a major world 
economic power, without assuming the political responsibilities to go with that 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to come to grips with the fact that we are a major nation 
again and begin to treat our actions accordingly -- to do our share in making 
the world more secure, not just through NATO (North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization), but in other areas of world affairs, even if taking on such 
responsibilities may be initially unpopular."

TOP TEAMSTERS GET ONLY BRIEF 'HI' FROM BUSH

<P>
Although he has openly embraced officials of the corruption-plagued Teamsters 
Union in the past, President-elect Bush offered only the briefest of private 
greetings to the union's leadership Tuesday when they attended a closed-door 
meeting with his designated chief of staff, John H. Sununu, Bush aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for Bush, said: "The Teamsters people were meeting 
with Sununu and the President-elect simply stopped by briefly. The purpose was 
to thank them for their support during the election campaign." 
</P>
<P>
A transition team source said that Bush "literally popped his head in the door 
and said 'Hi' " and left without making any substantive comments to union 
President William J. McCarthy and other top officials of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose top leadership faces a civil trial next month 
for alleged racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Intercede 
</P>
<P>
Sununu was said to have warned the group that the executive branch would not 
intercede in the pending trial, which stems from a suit filed by the Justice 
Department in June. In filing the suit in federal court in New York, U.S. Atty. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani charged that the Teamsters were deeply involved in 
organized crime, and he sought to use the federal Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations law to "take back the Teamsters from the Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
A source said that among those at the 20-minute session in Sununu's office were 
Teamsters Vice Presidents Joseph W. Morgan and Daniel C. Ligurotis and the 
union's general counsel, James T. Grady. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was not present when Sununu warned the men against discussing the RICO 
case, a transition source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Priority 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy has taken as his No. 1 priority beating the suit against himself and 
the top Teamsters officials. If successful, the suit would force out the 
union's top leadership and order a new, government-supervised election on 
grounds that the present leaders are either linked to organized crime or have 
done nothing about such links. 
</P>
<P>
Bush declined to meet publicly with the Teamsters officials, although in 1981 
and 1985 he appeared before the group to thank union leaders for their 
political support. The Teamsters were the only major union to support Bush and 
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and, unlike most unions, also backed the 
Reagan-Bush tickets in 1980 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
One source suggested that the Sununu meeting was meant to mollify Teamsters 
officials irked at Bush's absence.

The West German Red Cross said Tuesday that it has asked the Soviet ambassador

transporting emergency supplies to Soviet Armenia after the Dec. 7 earthquake.

<P>
A spokeswoman said Ambassador Yuli A. Kvitsinsky has agreed to appeal to 
Aeroflot to drop its demand for the equivalent of $353,000 for 20 flights from 
West Germany to Armenia with Red Cross clothes, medicines and digging 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know how long an appeal will take but we hope to hear something in 
the next few days," she said. The real cost to Aeroflot of the flights ran into 
millions, she added.

BUDGET REALITIES MAY SLOW 'KINDER NATION' GOAL

<TEXT>
<P>
In the expedient shorthand of his political campaign, George Bush drummed home 
his vision of the country he wanted to lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a kinder and gentler nation," he vowed from one shore to another, in 
small towns and growing cities, to farmers and steelworkers and to the biggest 
audience he faced: a television-watching America on the night of his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But the words and programs that Bush advisers believe helped define a new 
identity and blunted attacks by his Democratic foes face a future that is 
neither kind nor gentle. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush and his aides draft their specific fiscal agenda, Democrats and some 
prominent Republicans voice substantial doubt as to whether Bush's campaign 
promises to increase funding for education, the environment and children and to 
ease the problems of the poor will be prominently represented in the 1990 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Initiatives Doubted 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, insists 
that, because Bush has pledged not to increase taxes, there is simply no room 
for new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing jettisoned will be the campaign promises," Sasser bluntly 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the question of child care and expanding Head Start and school 
lunch programs and meeting the environmental commitments . . . are going to be 
the least of his worries. He needs to find out how he's going to escape the 
budget ax without proposing new revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, a fellow Republican, advises Bush against 
floating any new programs before making headway against the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The reductions ought to come first," Cheney said. "I think for the 
Administration to argue that we need new spending in certain areas takes them 
off the moral high ground." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush advisers are equally insistent that, because of Bush's personal 
instincts -- and the political damage if he turns his back on his promises -- 
the new President will attempt to force through at least some of his "kinder 
and gentler" approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"There are problems other than the deficit, challenges other than the deficit," 
one high-ranking Bush adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
The adviser was seconding others who believe that Bush will initiate new 
programs -- mostly introductory in nature and skimpy in outlay -- while he 
simultaneously works to curb the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
What Bush is planning remains a tightly held secret, pending his address to 
Congress on Feb. 9. Senior officials attending the daily planning sessions for 
Bush's first months have refused to comment on specifics, other than to say 
that Bush plans to adopt "new priorities," different from those in Ronald 
Reagan's final budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the two months since his election, the pressures against Bush's 
initiatives have grown. The President-elect must juggle not only the existing 
deficit but also the newly pressing need for more than $80 billion over the 
next 20 years to clean up and modernize federal nuclear facilities and a 
similar sum to bail out the troubled savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has sent conflicting signals about his intentions. At almost every 
opportunity, he has heralded his commitment to increased money for education, 
child care and the environment; but, at the same time, he has suggested that 
solving the deficit will take first priority. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bush equivocated recently when asked if he would press for money 
to back up his vow to cleanse the environment of acid rain and other 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not all the monies available that I would like to see for all the 
good things that need to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of Bush's proposals is difficult to ascertain because many of 
them were vague and thematic, advanced without cost estimates so that the 
candidate could not be backed into a corner about his spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Bush repeatedly made proposals in areas usually identified 
with Democrats to adroitly broaden his appeal and undercut the campaign of 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, his Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged Child Care Outlays 
</P>
<P>
He proposed a $2.2-billion series of tax credits and spending for child care. 
He vowed $600 million in new spending for education. He promised -- without 
saying how much it would cost -- to protect the environment. He said that he 
would expand the Head Start program to cover all needy 4-year-olds and would 
increase Medicaid for children and pregnant women. He advocated hundreds of 
millions of dollars in additional spending for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Bush spelled out more than $4 billion in new spending -- and 
described programs that, although he did not say so, would cost billions more. 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself has not detailed his priorities since the election, but senior 
aides suggest almost unanimously that he will push several proposals. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, those aides agree, Bush will request more money for elementary 
and secondary schools and for Head Start, the preschool program that is 
universally praised as beneficial to underprivileged children. 
</P>
<P>
However, Head Start is a costly venture, and it is illustrative of the lofty 
goals and vague fiscal details of Bush's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush routinely included the Head Start spending -- without a cost estimate -- 
in his calls for $600 million in education spending or as an addendum to his 
$2.2-billion child care proposal. But the government now spends $1.2 billion 
for Head Start while serving only 20% of the needy 4-year-olds -- meaning that 
almost $5 billion would be needed to round out the program as Bush has said he 
would like. 
</P>
<P>
Once he is President, Bush is also likely to press for some sort of child care 
program, although advisers suggest that a compromise may have to be reached 
between Bush's original plan -- heavily weighted toward tax credits -- and a 
Democratic plan that would give money to the states to use in licensed child 
care centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commission Suggested 
</P>
<P>
At least one adviser has suggested that Bush form a commission to study options 
in child care -- a notion that would buy Bush time to win support for his plan 
and delay funding. 
</P>
<P>
Bush advisers acknowledge that any recommended federal spending increases 
probably will be modest, setting a tone for change without seriously disrupting 
the budget. At the same time, Bush will press programs like his proposal for an 
ethics commission and for a domestic Peace Corps, which would spend $100 
million in seed money -- buttressed by matching donations -- to send young 
Americans into poor areas to help the disadvantaged. Both are seen as 
projecting a kinder and gentler image without much cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush understands that leadership in Washington consists of 1,000 little 
micromoves every day, the sum total of which adds up to leadership," a 
high-ranking aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers say that Bush will also reinforce the theme with displays of personal 
good will -- particularly to potential political opponents -- such as those 
that have marked his transition. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole kinder, gentler nation thing -- I don't think that implies only 
spending money," long-time Bush aide Peter Teeley said. "You can look at it in 
terms of spending but, also, I believe, it's the way you live your life." 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes' social approach, less grand than that of the more aloof Reagans who 
preceded them, is expected to pay dividends by underscoring the "kinder and 
gentler" style he envisioned during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of eight years, I don't think it will be a big deal to say, 'I've 
been to the White House.' Half the country will be able to say that," said one 
Bush adviser, intending only a hint of exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides see a successful start on some new initiatives as crucial, both to 
set a tone for his first term and to give him a running start on a second term. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, an early Bush supporter, said that Bush's 
policy proposals "preempted the Democratic rallying cries and undercut the 
message that they wanted to propose." 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush could not have won on negatives alone," said Leach, who believes 
that the new President will quickly propose -- and get -- modest spending 
increases for education and a compromise child care plan. "A (reelection 
campaign) in 1992 will have to be credited to . . . the positives." 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is credibility," seconded a senior aide, who 
suggested that Bush would be severely hurt in 1992 if he turned his back on his 
earlier vows. 
</P>
<P>
"If you increase Head Start, you may have to make that up elsewhere," the aide 
said. "But I don't buy the notion that there's no place left to cut." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the central stumbling block for Bush's proposals are of his own making: 
his insistence that he will not raise taxes and his reliance on a "flexible 
freeze" to cure the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Under that freeze, overall budget growth will be limited to the increase in 
inflation, and any new spending will have to be offset by equal cuts in other 
programs. Neither in the campaign nor in his transition has Bush detailed any 
cuts that would make room for new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic members of Congress, who have little faith in the flexible freeze 
and doubt Bush's commitment to more liberal programs, insist that Bush himself 
come up with funding for any new programs.

BAKKER PLEADS INNOCENT TO CHARGES HE MISUSED MILLIONS IN PTL FUNDS

Evangelist Jim Bakker pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal charges that he 
diverted millions of dollars from his PTL television audience for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor during the 
hearing for a gag order for all parties involved, based largely on comments by 
the retired federal bankruptcy judge who supervised the sale of PTL assets. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the gag order, Davis presented Taylor with a copy of a recent 
newspaper article in which retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds called 
Bakker a "sawed-off little runt." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he would consider the request, instructing attorneys to draft a 
consent order and present it to him by Thursday for approval. The magistrate 
told Davis he was concerned that Bakker would go on television and talk about 
the case, but he issued no formal request for Bakker to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker was silent during the hearing, but made a statement afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment," Bakker said. 
"The judge asked for no conversations about this case, but I'd like to say that 
Tammy and I are thrilled to be back on TV." 
</P>
<P>
The Bakkers began broadcasting "The Jim and Tammy Show" from their leased home 
near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker did not appear on the telecast 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker quit the PTL ministry in March, 1987, after admitting a sexual encounter 
with former secretary Jessica Hahn and paying her money to keep quiet. The 
ministry he founded sought reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months 
later. Last month, a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets at a 
bankruptcy auction. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's February term but set no 
specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days to file other motions.

SEN. BENTSEN'S FATHER KILLED IN CAR CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
FLAMBOYANT RIO GRANDE VALLEY PIONEER CARVED OUT LAND EMPIRE 
</P>

<P>
Lloyd Bentsen Sr., the flamboyant 95-year-old father of the 1988 Democratic 
vice presidential candidate, was killed in a car wreck early Tuesday morning as 
he was driving on a country road near the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen, one of the pioneers of the Rio Grande Valley, was making the morning 
rounds of his 42,000 acres of land when the accident occurred. Mike Cox, a 
spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said the elder Bentsen 
apparently failed to yield the right of way at a highway intersection and was 
hit on the passenger side by another car. The two people in the other car, 
Ramiro Rosalez and his sister, Margarita, were injured and taken to a nearby 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen Jr. immediately left his Washington office to fly to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Bentsen arrived in the Rio Grande Valley more than 70 years ago and 
began carving out an empire through sweat and a keen head for business that 
substituted for a formal education. Over the years, he became a millionaire 
many times over and said in an interview during the presidential campaign that 
be had bought and sold more than 250,000 acres in the valley over the years. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, he took reporters on a tour of his land and the Buick he 
was driving had a radar detector on the dashboard. There was a sign on the gate 
of the family home, given to him by his then-candidate son, which said, "Never 
Mind the Dog. Beware of Owner." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bentsen sent the sign after his father got the drop on three armed thieves 
stealing a carload of fruit from one of his citrus groves last year. 
</P>
<P>
"His idea of gun control is a steady hand," the senator said of his father. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen Sr. was a great spinner of stories. He told with relish about lassoing 
a 64-pound rattlesnake and then throwing it into the back of a pickup truck. Or 
about wolf hunting and mustang breaking as a boy in South Dakota, of being a 
migrant worker, of plowing into a horse-drawn buggy while going 100 m.p.h. on a 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 But his favorite story was the one about meeting his wife, Dolly, when he was 
visiting Mission, Tex., in the valley while stationed in San Antonio during 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
"I seen the prettiest girl God ever created walking towards me," he said. "When 
the war was over, Mission was the first place I hit." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen began building his empire when he talked a bank into lending him $500 
and bought his first acreage for the then-unheard of sum of $7 an acre. But the 
value increased 100-fold over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, there was a flurry of suits against Bentsen and his 
brother, Elmer, by people who bought land in the valley and claimed that they 
were cheated because the orchards were not irrigated. Some of those cases were 
won by the Bentsens while others were settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
"I never defrauded a man in my life," Bentsen said. "I never lied in my life."

PROP. 103 CHAIRMAN ENTERS HOSTILE TERRITORY BEFORE INSURANCE AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 103 campaign chairman Harvey Rosenfield said Tuesday that he fears 
that if insurance companies continue to oppose implementing his measure, "the 
alternative will be the elimination of the insurance industry as a private 
force" in California and the advent of a public insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield, entering hostile territory in his first appearance before a group 
of insurance agents since the election, told the Orange County chapter of the 
Professional Insurance Agents Assn. meeting in Anaheim that he did not favor a 
public system in the past and that he believes it "would be a disaster" now. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, in the capitalist system, there's no place for the 
government selling insurance," he said. But there is "no doubt in my mind," he 
added, that that could be the result if Californians "get tired of waiting" for 
a more progressive industry attitude toward "reform." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield's talk drew 350 agents to a meeting room at the Quality Inn near 
Disneyland. The audience groaned and sighed when he made observations that many 
agents said showed ignorance of the way the insurance system operates. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield drew hoots when he said that a person's address, not his or her 
driving record, determines auto insurance prices and suggested that an Anaheim 
resident who has a good driving record pays just as much as one who has had 
five accidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discuss Facts 
</P>
<P>
"You're wrong, you're wrong," cried one agent, and Rosenfield offered to 
discuss the facts with the audience. Agents said the driver with the five 
accidents would pay far more than the one with a good record, no matter where 
he lived. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield drew groans from many in the audience when, suggesting that agents 
should take less in commissions than they take now, he added, "You don't 
understand the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange began when a questioner, noting that insurance rate rollbacks 
called for in Proposition 103 would be from 1987 levels and that the cuts would 
average about a third off present rates, asked Rosenfield how he thinks agents 
could stand such a large reduction in their sales commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield first suggested that lower prices would mean more insurance sales, 
so agents could recoup some of their losses that way. This drew sighs of 
apparent disbelief from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Sacrifice' 
</P>
<P>
He then told the agents, as the atmosphere in the room grew tense, that they 
were "going to have to sacrifice something (of their income) for one year 
(under the rollback provisions) to those consumers who pay too much." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce A. Broadwater, a Garden Grove agent who had been reading audience 
questions to the Proposition 103 chairman, suggested that Rosenfield does not 
understand the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies will leave the state if the state Supreme Court allows 
Proposition 103 to go into full effect, Broadwater said, and agents will not 
sell insurance if all they can earn is a 5% commission. 
</P>
<P>
Another uproar ensued when Rosenfield, answering a critical question about the 
provision in Proposition 103 that allows banks into the insurance business, 
suggested that if banks tried to tie loans to a borrower's willingness to buy 
insurance from the bank, they would run afoul of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
The agent who questioned him said he believes that it is unlikely that such 
laws would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Rosenfield's speech was devoted to suggestions that insurance agents 
divorce themselves from the interests of insurance companies and join the 
Proposition 103 sponsors in becoming "consumer advocates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back Up Consumers' 
</P>
<P>
"Help consumers do more comparison shopping between companies," he urged. "Join 
us in fighting against cancellations and non-renewals. Back up consumers. . . . 
Demand support for changes by companies, not no-fault, which has not been 
successful except in one or two states, but stronger drunk- driving laws, 
regulations against fraud and more auto safety programs." 
</P>
<P>
The agents applauded politely at the end of the speech and again at the end of 
the question-answer period, but many were muttering to colleagues that 
Rosenfield seemed uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield told the agents when he was introduced that he had accepted the 
invitation to appear because he believed that the setting would give him a 
chance "to explain matters" to a significant group that occupies a position 
between the companies and the consumers and because he believes that agents 
have a responsibility to "protect the integrity of the insurance industry" by 
urging it to adopt a friendlier attitude toward the public.

5-CENT-A-GALLON INCREASE IN STATE GAS TAX PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Assembly Democrats proposed a hefty increase in the state's gasoline tax 
Tuesday to finance an ambitious $21.5-billion transportation program providing 
for projects ranging from road construction to tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
called for raising the gas tax 5 cents per gallon and most truck weight fees by 
30% in 1990. After that, these taxes would gradually increase, rising every two 
years for the next decade based on a formula tied to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Katz estimated that the state's gas tax -- now 9 cents -- 
would rise to 24 cents a gallon. Consumers also pay federal gasoline taxes of 9 
cents and the state's 6% sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
"Understand that this (proposal) between now and the year 2000 will literally 
build from a construction standpoint, from a mass transit standpoint and from a 
road maintenance standpoint every single thing that has been identified as 
needed in the state of California," Katz told a Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's proposal includes a technical feature designed to address Gov. George 
Deukmejian's opposition to imposing new taxes without voter approval. Although 
Katz's bill could be approved by two-thirds majorities in both houses, 
implementation of the tax increase feature would require voter passage of a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
That amendment, which will be included in separate legislation, would modify 
the state spending limit. The tax increase proposal could not go into effect 
without modification of that limit, which was approved by voters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
With Brown nodding agreement from a seat a few feet away, Katz said he hopes 
that the vote on the amendment altering the spending limit would satisfy 
Deukmejian's demand that all increases be approved by the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's press secretary, Kevin Brett, immediately said it would not, 
explaining that the governor believes that the tax proposal itself should go on 
the ballot and not just a constitutional amendment that makes no reference to 
the tax increase proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The governor reminded reporters of his opposition to tax increases during a 
question-and-answer session earlier in the day at the Sacramento Press Club. 
"If they want to submit a proposal to the electorate and let the people vote on 
it, I would be willing to consider that," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has expressed similar reservations about a rival Senate proposal 
calling for a 10-cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax. That measure 
also does not require voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent move toward compromise, Deukmejian has invited lawmakers, local 
government officials and business and labor leaders to a "transportation 
summit" Feb. 8 with the goal of drafting a transportation financing plan to be 
submitted to voters. 
</P>
<P>
The state is facing an anticipated highway construction deficit of $3.5 billion 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Katz-Brown proposal, $21.5 billion would be raised over the next 
decade. The money would be distributed to a variety of programs, including $9 
billion for local street and road maintenance, $6 billion for state highway 
projects, $1.5 billion for a reserve to cover highway maintenance costs and 
emergencies, $150 million for highway sound walls, $3.75 billion for mass 
transit guideway construction and a $100-million program to plant 20 million 
trees along roads and highways and acquire and preserve environmentally 
sensitive land. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said grants to local government for mass transit would require that the 
governments demonstrate their ability to operate more efficiently. To be 
eligible for state money to help in local street maintenance, he said, cities 
would also have to adopt plans -- such as ride-sharing and the elimination of 
subsidized downtown parking -- to reduce traffic congestion by 25% over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 billion for highway construction would be specifically earmarked for 
projects already included in the state's five-year transportation plan, the 
assemblyman said.

STOCKTON TRAGEDY MIRRORS SPENCER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unthinkable happened Tuesday morning at Cleveland Elementary School in 
Stockton when a gunman with a semiautomatic rifle opened fire on terrified 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A horrifying event, but not unique. 
</P>
<P>
The sniper's rampage was eerily similar in some ways to an attack at Cleveland 
Elementary School in San Diego almost precisely 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reason Was Obvious 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, 1979, a petite, red-haired, 16-year-old girl picked up a 
.22-caliber semiautomatic rifle and peered through its telescopic sight at 
schoolchildren arriving at the school, across the street from her Lake Atlin 
Avenue home in a quiet San Carlos neighborhood. Seemingly without reason, 
Brenda Ann Spencer opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, two men lay dead, and eight children and a police officer had 
been wounded. But, unlike Tuesday's sniper in Stockton -- who turned his gun on 
himself after the shootings -- Spencer entered into a six-hour standoff with 
police, and at one point she told negotiators that she had reloaded her gun and 
would "hold out" as long as the police could. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer was finally persuaded to lay down her rifle, a Christmas gift from her 
father, and surrender. But not before she told a newspaper reporter over the 
telephone that she had committed the crime "because I don't like Mondays." 
</P>
<P>
Her infamous statement became the title of a hit song by the Irish rock band 
the Boomtown Rats, written by lead singer Bob Geldof, who later became famous 
for his African famine-relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Sentence Wanted 
</P>
<P>
The song was released in October, 1979, the same week Spencer was scheduled for 
trial in Santa Ana, where the case was moved because of extensive local 
publicity. The former Patrick Henry High School student was tried as an adult, 
and prosecutors sought a life term without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, described by neighbors as a quiet tomboy obsessed with guns, violence 
and fantasies of killing police, had entered a plea of innocent by reason of 
insanity. But, at the last minute, she pleaded guilty to first-degree murder 
and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer, now 26, lives in the California Institution for Women in Frontera, 
near Chino, and authorities say she is "a model prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
"She has a clean disciplinary record and has adjusted well to the institution," 
said Chief Deputy Hal Tanner, adding that he did not know whether Spencer was 
aware of Tuesday's events in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Paroled in 2001 
</P>

San Diego's Cleveland Elementary School, a victim of sagging enrollment, no

The building is now being leased by the private San Diego Hebrew Day School, 
but a plaque memorializing slain Principal Burton Wragg and custodian Michael 
Suchar remains implanted in the concrete by the flagpole. An abstract aluminum 
sculpture created by a junior high school art teacher still graces the school 
district headquarters on Normal Street in Hillcrest, in memory of the two men 
who were gunned down trying to shield the schoolchildren.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: CARLSBAD NOT YET READY FOR 'KNIGHT OF YOUR LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is there a medieval castle in Carlsbad's future? 
</P>
<P>
Sword fighting, jousting and knights on horseback? Up to 1,040 people at a time 
dining on roasted chicken flambe spare ribs, herb-basted potatoes and fruity 
wine cocktails? Half a million people a year touring the Hall of Arms, the 
Knight Club, the Courtyard of Crests and Crafts, an art gallery and the 
stables? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes, if Medieval Times Dinner &amp; Tournament Inc., a theme 
park-restaurant-dinner theater chain based in Buena Park, has its way. The 
answer is no, unless concerns of city planners about traffic, height 
limitations and architectural conformity are satisfied or overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Medieval Times would like to build on a 4-acre site west of Interstate 5 just 
north of Marie Callender's restaurant on Avenida Encinas. The company's other 
castles are in Buena Park; Kissimmee, Fla.; Benidorm, Spain; the island of 
Majorca in Spain and, soon, The Meadowlands in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Each diner receives a color-coded crown and is assigned a champion to represent 
him during the ceremonial procession and games. There are 11 shows a week 
during the winter, 15 a week during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We think of ourselves not just as a restaurant or park, but as an 
"attraction," spokeswoman MaryAnn Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the land-use rub. The heraldic spirit of 1093 and the zoning 
restrictions of 1989 clash like two armored knights on galloping stallions. 
</P>
<P>
Medieval Times would like a 65-foot tower. Carlsbad has a 35-foot limit. 
Medieval Times would like a freeway-catchy sign that says "For the Knight of 
Your Life." Carlsbad likes signs to be demure. 
</P>
<P>
Powell is sure that these and other sticky points are not insurmountable. 
"We're confident we'll be in Carlsbad in the not-too-distant future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Michael Holzmiller is wary. "We have a lot of talking to do 
about traffic and other visual impacts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bright Idea for SDG&amp;E 
</P>
<P>
Fact One: A tried-and-true lobbying technique involves contacting a 
politician's campaign contributors and asking them to speak to the pol on your 
behalf. It's sometimes indelicately called the squeeze play. 
</P>
<P>
Fact Two: A secretary to SDG&amp;E lobbyist Buzz Schott was spotted at the city 
clerk's office at San Diego City Hall, intently studying the contributor lists 
of City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we know, the better job we can do," Schott explained. Any connection 
between this surge of interest and the would-be buyout of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric by Southern California Edison? 
</P>
<P>
"Could be," Schott said. "We're definitely trying to gear up for any future 
conflict. . . . We're looking for anything that might help us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homework Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
Higher education is so broadening. 
</P>
<P>
MiraCosta College in Oceanside is offering a seminar March 11 on "Finding a 
Mate in San Diego." It is advertised thusly in the spring catalogue: 
</P>
<P>
"Take charge of your social life. Learn proven methods of how to identify a 
compatible, stable, available mate. What to say and what not to say. . . . 
Learn flirting tips and how to tell if someone is interested or just being 
friendly. Hear about six kinds of love and a 14-point plan to improve your 
social life . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The text will be instructor Sally Gary's book, "San Diego Connections: A 
Single's Guide &amp; Resource Book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Aboard Aren't Human 
</P>
<P>
Yes, those were mice you saw darting beneath the seats on the Amtrak train 
between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mice are a continual problem aboard the trains, and Amtrak has a year-round 
contract with an exterminator. It's the food, not the travel, that lures the 
mice. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are slobs and leave all kinds of food scraps on the train," 
explained Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd. "The San Diego-to-L.A. train usually 
makes two round trips a day and isn't cleaned thoroughly until the end of the 
day. The mice can eat quite well until the exterminator gets them." 
</P>
<P>
The freeloading rodents also have a preference for riding first-class.

GRADE-SETUP SHIFT PROPOSED FOR LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Jolla community will be asked to consider major grade-configuration 
changes to its schools beginning in the fall of 1990 under a plan presented 
Tuesday to the San Diego Unified School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla High would change to a four-year, grades 9-12 configuration; Muirlands 
Junior High would become a grades 6-8 school, and the three elementary schools 
-- Bird Rock, La Jolla and Torrey Pines -- would change to grades kindergarten 
through 5. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to relieve crowding foreseen within the next couple of 
years in the elementary schools by taking advantage of empty classrooms 
expected at the secondary level. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Bird Rock is at capacity, with 462 students, and La Jolla Elementary, 
with 565, and Torrey Pines, with 372, are close to capacity unless they try to 
squeeze portable classrooms onto playgrounds. But the high school will have 
room for 200 to 300 more students next year, and Muirlands has room now for an 
300 more students. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district's planning staff supports the idea as the best way to 
solve capacity problems, it received board approval Tuesday only to discuss the 
plan with La Jolla community schools and organizations to reach a consensus 
before a decision is made in April. 
</P>
<P>
But several board members said Tuesday that they believe the La Jolla community 
will overwhelmingly support the idea, especially since it is based on a similar 
proposal first suggested in 1983 by a La Jolla advisory committee but not acted 
upon because few capacity problems then existed. 
</P>
<P>
As advantages to the plan, the staff listed: an end to crowding at Bird Rock; 
space for the district's Early Admission to Kindergarten program at the three 
elementaries; space for the new fine arts instruction now unavailable because 
of a lack of classrooms; maintenance of existing neighborhood boundaries for 
schools, considered important in the long-established community; establishment 
of the middle-school concept, which educational researchers believe provides a 
better learning and social transition for pre-teens with its sixth- through 
eighth-grade setup than the traditional 7-9 program; opportunity for high 
school students to participate in four years of extracurricular programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negatives Listed 
</P>
<P>
As negatives, administrators pointed out: the need to train teachers and 
community in what to expect from a changed grade structure; parent fear and/or 
opposition to sending sixth-graders to a middle school; crowding at La Jolla 
High during the first year of the 9-12 configuration, until a science wing is 
completed in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators rejected the alternative of reopening an elementary school shut 
in the 1970s because of declining enrollments and now leased out for private 
use. The continuing costs of reopening the school would far exceed the 
one-time, estimated $120,000 expense to begin the grade-configuration plan. 
</P>
<P>
Multitrack year-round attendance, where three groups of students attend at any 
one time while a fourth group goes on vacation, was also rejected because a 
school needs at least 750 students to have its enrollment split equitably and 
receive all necessary educational services.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges against a sheriff's deputy accused of molesting his 13-year-old 
daughter were dismissed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Van McClung, 33, of Chula Vista, had been charged with three counts of 
molesting the girl from 1982 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Cathy Stephenson said a Juvenile Court judge ruled in a 
hearing on the fitness of the home that there was not enough evidence that any 
molestation took place. Based on that finding, San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Herbert Exarhos dismissed the charges. 
</P>
<P>
McClung has been suspended from the Sheriff's Department since he was charged 
April 7.

CARLSBAD BANS DOGS FROM BEACHES, PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dog days of summer have come in January for Carlsbad's canines. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to many complaints from seaside residents who allege that 
canine excrement is making the city's beaches unsightly, the City Council 
followed the lead of other coastal communities and voted 4-1 Tuesday night to 
amend an existing dog-control ordinance and ban dogs from Carlsbad's beaches 
and parks. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment, sponsored by Councilwoman Ann Kulchin, will become effective 
June 1. Dogs are now allowed to play on the beaches but must be leashed and 
accompanied by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I was responding to a constituent's complaint who got tired of seeing people 
parking their cars and then letting their dogs go free on the beach," Kulchin 
said. "And then, when I started looking into the matter, I discovered that, 
hey, we're the only city around that allows dogs on the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
Although the amendment was officially adopted Tuesday evening, with only 
Councilman Mark Pettine voting against it, the issue was forwarded to the 
city's Parks and Recreation Commission for further study. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission decides that the ban should be less stringent, or develops 
alternative solutions to the problem, such proposals will be introduced to the 
City Council, and the new ordinance might be amended, Kulchin said. The 
commission would set the fine if it decides one should be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Annoyed residents said irresponsible dog owners who failed to clean up after 
their pets were creating a nuisance and causing unsanitary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But such a comprehensive ban would be unfair to dog owners who try to keep the 
beaches clean, said Nancy Koontz, who takes her beagle, Nellie, for a beach 
stroll every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Koontz gave council members a petition signed by nearly 100 dog 
owners who pledged to comply with a "pooper scooper" ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"The petition was signed by people who opposed the dog ban ordinance and 
supported what I call a responsible, dog owners' ordinance." Koontz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of having dogs totally banned from beaches, why not have people 
required to clean up after them?" Koontz asked. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the ban refuse to back down and cite the use of tight 
restrictions at other North County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the only beach in North County, generally speaking, that allows dogs on 
the beach," said Don Jackson, who lives a block from the ocean. "Oceanside 
prohibits to the north, and the state beaches prohibit to the south. So lots of 
dog owners from other cities come to Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
"I see people coming in cars from various places," Jackson said. "Then, they 
let their dogs go. The dogs have to relieve themselves, and they usually do it 
by the pathway or the access. Those areas become quite an obstacle course." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mike Silvestri, a state lifeguard with the San Diego Coast 
District, which is responsible for covering 13 miles of North County beaches 
from Torrey Pines to Carlsbad, most beaches enforce comprehensive bans. 
</P>
<P>
At Carlsbad and South Carlsbad State Beaches and Moonlight State Beach in 
Encinitas, a ban is in effect, Silvestri said, adding that violations carry a 
$50 penalty. For second- and third-time offenders, the fine increases to $100 
and $200, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Kulchin said Oceanside, Solana Beach and Encinitas all forbid dogs from roaming 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The new Carlsbad ordinance, however, does have exceptions. It will only be 
effective at city beaches. Dogs will still be allowed to play at Carlsbad's 
many lagoons, including Batiquitos, Buena Vista Lagoon and Agua Hedionda. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not apply to dogs that help the visually impaired or assist 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dog owners said they will try to persuade parks and recreation commissioners to 
support alternatives to the ban. And even beach-resident Jackson said he would 
be open-minded about effective options. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody suggested restricting dogs just to the early-morning hours," said 
Jackson, who once owned a dachshund and took it for walks along the beach. 
"Well, the problem with that is the dogs leave, but their leavings don't. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm willing to listen to good suggestions. . . . It's not that I dislike 
dogs, but, with more people and more dog owners going to the beaches, it's a 
problem we have to address."

COLLEGE DISTRICT GETS GRANT FOR $315,607 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Community College District has received $315,607 from the 
controversial foundation established several years ago to help pay educational 
expenses. The district covers 100,000 students at City, Mesa and Miramar 
colleges, and at 10 continuing education centers. 
</P>
<P>
The grant brings the total money from the San Diego Community College District 
Foundation during the past four years to $1.03 million. The foundation, 
established by a previous Board of Trustees, annually gives the district half 
the interest earnings from its $7-million endowment. The other half can be used 
for operating expenses but has been kept in the endowment the last two years to 
increase interest income in future years. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is now the subject of a legal battle between the district and 
disgruntled faculty members who allege that the foundation has illegally used 
revenue belonging to the district to set up courses that compete with the 
district's own courses. The new board and chancellor of the district have said 
they want to put past battles over the foundation behind them, but concede that 
legal action may continue indefinitely.

FADING BEACON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his farewell address to the nation last week, President Reagan spoke 
movingly of the United States as "a beacon . . . for all who must have freedom, 
for all the pilgrims from all the lost places." What the President didn't 
mention is that the United States no longer welcomes all the world's pilgrims 
and refugees; there are too many. The hard realities of U.S. refugee policy 
were underscored a day after the President's speech, when his Administration 
announced that, to make room for more refugees from the Soviet Union, mostly 
Jews and Armenians, it was slashing by 6,500 the places earmarked for Southeast 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
This so-called "quota reallocation" solves one immediate problem: It will speed 
up the processing of the thousands of Soviet citizens who finally have been 
granted exit permits after years of campaigning by the United States. But the 
move may exacerbate other problems. About 5,500 of the reallocated slots came 
from the Orderly Departure Program for Vietnam, which has permitted Vietnamese 
with U.S. connections, including political prisoners, to seek haven in the 
United States without risking their lives in leaky little boats. Vietnam has 
been slow to process refugees for this program; that's why the 5,500 places 
could be reassigned to the Soviet Union, the State Department said. But many 
Vietnamese-Americans are dismayed by the U.S. action, fearing that it will ease 
the pressure on Vietnam to release refugees through the Orderly Departure 
Program and will encourage thousands more Vietnamese to set out to sea. And 
there's no justification at all, they say, for taking another 1,000 places from 
boat people already crowded into relocation centers in Hong Kong, Malaysia and 
Thailand, where some have waited for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1980 Refugee Act, Reagan could simply have raised the overall quota 
for 1989 to make room for the sudden influx of Soviet refugees without 
compromising the places for the Vietnamese. That would have cost the American 
taxpayers as much as $45 million for transportation and social services but 
would have been the more compassionate and equitable course. And it would have 
averted the charges that are now being voiced that, once again, the United 
States has shown its preference for Europeans over dark-skinned refugees from 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of U.S. refugee policy also are under attack: Central Americans 
are convinced that their chances of qualifying as refugees are practically nil. 
Indochinese worry that "compassion fatigue" has hardened Americans to their 
plight. The countries of Southeast Asia that have provided temporary shelters 
for boat people fear that those bulging refugee camps may become permanent 
fixtures. And, while thousands of Vietnamese remain in those camps, their hopes 
for resettlement in the United States dwindling, refugee organizations are 
warning of another possible exodus of refugees -- from Afghanistan, if civil 
war breaks out there as Soviet forces withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally the United States has offered a safe haven on a scale unmatched 
by the world's other powers; 90,000 refugees will be given asylum in 1989 
alone. Yet as the demand for asylum grows, as more stateless people languish in 
Vienna and southern Mexico and Hong Kong, it is clear that their sheer numbers 
make it impossible for the United States alone to cope. The 1979 Geneva 
agreement that called for Vietnamese boat people to be housed in Southeast Asia 
while they awaited permanent resettlement elsewhere has broken down. The 1980 
Refugee Act, with its requirement that would-be refugees show "a well-founded 
fear of persecution" in their home countries, has been unevenly applied in 
Central America and threatens immense tragedy in Asia, where Vietnamese 
rejected by the United States as "economic refugees" may be repatriated to 
Hanoi. If President-elect Bush is looking for causes that demand immediate 
global attention, he need look no further than refugee policy.

A NEW DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan's obsession with tiny Nicaragua during his two terms kept the 
U.S. government from dealing with more profound problems in the Western 
Hemisphere. Now an impressive array of 60 political leaders from the Americas, 
led by former U.S. Ambassador Sol M. Linowitz and former Costa Rican President 
Daniel Oduber, propose a new direction for President-elect Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In a report, "The Americas in 1989: Consensus for Action," the group, 
Inter-American Dialogue, says that general agreements have emerged since its 
first meetings in 1982 on how the hemisphere can best deal with several complex 
problems. The section of the Dialogue's 59-page report understandably getting 
the most attention deals with ways to end the violence in Central America. The 
prestigious panel says that the peace plan proposed last year by Costa Rica's 
President Oscar Arias Sanchez created the framework for an end to a decade of 
warfare. But before the plan can work, the report concludes, the United States 
and Nicaragua must reach a mutal security agreement. The U.S. government must 
give up any idea of over-throwing the Nicaraguan government, and Nicaragua's 
Sandinista rulers must curtail their dependence on the Soviet Bloc. That means 
negotiations between Washington and Managua, which Reagan stubbornly refused to 
pursue but which should be among Bush's first moves on taking office. 
</P>
<P>
The report is equally forthright and sensible on other subjects, reporting 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After six years of economic depression, most Latin Americans are so much 
worse off todaythan they were a decade ago that the debt crisis could soon 
spark a political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Latin America's economy must grow by at least 5% a year to restore 
confidence. To do that, Latin American governments must restructure their 
economies and revamp their development strategies, the United States must deal 
with its own financial problems, there must be more lending to Latin America, 
and debt-reduction agreements must be negotiated between individual countries 
and creditor banks. 
</P>

CLOUD OVER MEESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Reagan's loyalty to an old friend has blinded him to the ethical 
failings of his former attorney general, Edwin Meese III, and to the shame that 
Meese brought on the Justice Department. Instead of commending the department's 
Office of Professional Responsibility for its thorough investigation of the man 
who once was the nation's highest law-enforcement officer, Reagan denounced the 
report as "unnecessary and unwarranted," the work of Meese's "political 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Oh? In fact, the report is the work of Michael E. Shaheen Jr., a career Justice 
Department lawyer who has headed the Office of Professional Responsibility 
since its inception in 1975. He is the expert on the department's own ethical 
guidelines as well as the 1965 executive order that commands all federal 
employees to refrain from activities that would shake Americans' confidence in 
government integrity. So Shaheen speaks with some authority when he says that 
Meese engaged in "conduct which should not be tolerated of any government 
employee, especially not the attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Professional Responsibility is the third investigative body to 
criticize the former attorney general -- more proof, if any were needed, of the 
gravity of Meese's offenses. Its report contains no bombshells, simply more 
details about how Meese used his influence to boost the business concerns of E. 
Robert Wallach, failed to report income to the Internal Revenue Service and 
made decisions about telecommunications while owning telephone stock -- all in 
violation of established ethical standards. Meese claimed total vindicaton last 
summer when independent counsel James C. McKay concluded that he had broken 
conflict-of-interest and tax laws but decided not to indict him. Shaheen's 
report, however, points out what should have been evident to Meese -- that 
escaping indictment is not the same as vindication. "The American public is 
entitled to both the appearance and the reality of impartial, honest 
government," the report said. Thus it dispatched "the claims by Mr. Meese that 
the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether an independent 
counsel seeks an official's indictment." 
</P>
<P>
None of this apparently matters to Meese, now happily working for a foundation, 
or to the President, dreaming of his retirement, just two days away, in 
California. On ethical questions, neither seems educable. But the report of the 
Office of Professional Responsibility should stand as a reminder to future 
Administrations that official sleaziness will be exposed and that no one, not 
even the President's old friends, is above the law.

U.S. RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leland's and Nelson's columns leave me chagrined and ashamed at the criminal 
acts that are being perpetrated on the Nicaraguan people (particularly the 
children) in the name of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is an anomaly that at the same time public support has mounted in the U.S. 
to send aid from all levels to "Communist Armenians" we make demands on how 
funds authorized by Congress are to be distributed to children in Nicaragua. In 
all of the rhetoric the point may be missed that Sandinista Nicaragua has a 
Communist Party which is part of the opposition to the Sandinista government 
while the Armenian Republic, containing many non-Armenian nationalities, is 
part of a Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps those who were so anxious to help the Armenians with food, clothing, 
medicine and money might be willing to have the excesses that are not needed 
there diverted to help the people of Nicaragua in their added misery brought on 
by Hurricane Joan.

CONTAINING CAR INSURANCE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack Tenner wrote in The Times that insurance 
companies in California should be treated like a telephone company or any other 
public utility ("Logic Could Go a Long Way in Auto Insurance Dispute," Op-Ed 
Page, Dec. 27). 
</P>
<P>
Judge Tenner appears to be advocating a system that would require a state 
agency similar to the Public Utilities Commission to guarantee insurance 
company profits just as public utilities are guaranteed profits. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal, unfortunately, is misguided and fails to attack the underlying 
problem of California's auto insurance woes and voter outrage at premiums -- 
skyrocketing claims costs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if insurance companies were treated like other utilities, as Judge Tenner 
advocates, the regulating body still would have to hike rates (at the expense 
of consumers) provided cost increases were left unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so expensive to provide auto insurance in California? 
</P>
<P>
Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Hospital and medical care payments in auto accident cases are 72% higher in 
California than other similar states. And, those payments -- mostly paid by 
insurance companies -- continue to escalate. 
</P>
<P>
* Auto insurance fraud -- which is 83% higher here than New York -- is rampant 
in California, costing consumers an estimated $500 million to $1.5 billion 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
* Costs associated with unusually large numbers of lawsuits are exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Judge Tenner and the trial lawyers of this state also miss the 
mark at the expense of consumers when they call for a hands-off policy on 
California's tort, or civil justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics clearly show that our existing legal system for dealing with auto 
accident cases is abused and overloaded with frivolous cases. And where does 
that leave the accidents victims? Not as the ultimate financial winners one 
might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND Corp.'s Institute for Civil Justice stated in a 1986 report that tort 
victims received only about 46 cents for each dollar awarded them for their 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Trial lawyers may receive up to 40% of those damage awards, which is the reason 
they so strenuously oppose any meaningful reforms of the claims-handling 
system.

REAGAN LEAVES PURE GREED RIDING HIGH IN THE SADDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Reagan rides off into the California sunset, he can be proud that 
in many respects the Republic is in better shape than when he took office eight 
years ago. There is one thing on his record, however, that should cause him 
personal pain and regret. That is the enshrinement, with his amiable 
toleration, of greed and sleaze as operating norms in the American business and 
financial communities. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, given his lack of relevant background or personal interest, 
Reagan's greatest successes came in foreign affairs. Critics can argue that 
Reagan was the lucky beneficiary of a Soviet economic crisis that finally drove 
the Kremlin to adopt a more accommodating, less threatening posture toward the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Even if that is true, the deal-from-strength President deserves credit for 
having the wisdom and flexibility to take advantage of the historic 
opportunity, when it came, to put U.S.-Soviet relations on a new, more 
constructive path. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the President never appreciated the contradiction between his 
determination to make America more militarily secure and his insensitivity to 
the moral decay that is corroding the foundations of the U.S. economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's personal honesty has not been seriously questioned. But he proved 
remarkably relaxed about the transgressions of some subordinates -- and many, 
many businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
The President came into office with an abiding faith in the workings of free 
markets and a conviction that the best thing government could do was get out of 
the way and let business do its thing. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt federal regulation had gone too far in some areas; a certain 
correction was called for in the interest of consumers and a more competitive 
economy. But regulation of banks and other financial institutions came about in 
the first place because of the irresponsible, anti-public behavior of the 
wheelers and dealers of yesteryear. The same is true of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense tells you that, to the degree that federal regulation was removed, 
there was a need for self-restraint in corporate board rooms. That restraint 
has not been forthcoming. Pure greed, unattached to any visible social benefit, 
is increasingly the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious example is the fraud in defense contracting. But a more glaring 
example is the savings-and-loan industry, which responded to a loosening of 
regulatory laws and controls by going on a reckless binge of speculative 
lending and outright corruption. Federal officials say that of the hundreds of 
S&amp;L insolvencies, 75% involved fraud or criminal conduct. The American 
taxpayer is going to be stuck with the bill -- up to $70 billion or more -- for 
this particular exercise in deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are leveraged buyouts, or LBOs. Mergers, including hostile 
takeovers, can result in stronger, more productive companies. But in most of 
today's takeovers the main idea is not to improve the acquired firms but to 
loot them. American capitalism is threatened with major harm as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Typically the raiding group puts up little money of its own. The takeover is 
financed by great amounts of borrowing, including the issuance of junk bonds. 
To cope with repayment, the acquired corporations often raid employee pension 
funds, slash the work force, cut investment in research and new product 
development, and sell off whole divisions or subsidiaries -- frequently to 
foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Greed-driven LBOs hurt the American economy in all sorts of ways. But the most 
debilitating effect is the obsession with short-term profits at the expense of 
long-term competitiveness -- not only in companies that have been acquired but 
in firms that fear they will be. 
</P>
<P>
The best business brains in Europe and Japan are dedicated to doing whatever it 
takes to conquer world markets -- including ours. Too many American managers 
spend their time scheming to get rich, then richer still, through financial 
manipulations that do nothing to enhance U.S. economic strength and a great 
deal to damage it. 
</P>
<P>
If that situation continues, U.S. living standards will erode and America will 
soon be unable to afford the military strength that Reagan rightly considers 
essential to peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of factors, including warped tax codes and a value-deficient system of 
business education, are involved. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan, with his gift for communicating with the American people, could 
have made a difference. He could have used the power of the presidency as a 
"bully pulpit" to sound the alarm -- to make sleazy business behavior socially 
unacceptable and to energize the watchdog agencies of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the President didn't do that. He just looked the other way and, 
by doing so, became an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush's economic team is making some encouraging noises that suggest a 
desire to deal with the destructive emphasis of American business on short-term 
profits. Whether the new President will also confront the moral degeneration in 
the business community remains to be seen.

HALFWAY HOUSES TRIGGER ALARM;

<P>
AGOURA RESIDENTS FEAR PROLIFERATION OF YOUTH HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura residents who fear that their bedroom community is becoming a depository 
for juvenile delinquents are demanding new controls over privately run halfway 
houses in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners say a proliferation of state-licensed group homes for teen-agers 
with emotional disorders or on probation for minor crimes is burdening their 
schools and jeopardizing property values. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say that three such homes, each housing six juveniles, have been 
opened in upper-middle-class, single-family neighborhoods in recent months and 
that a fourth is planned. Three of the four are within a half-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek New Law 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners plan to meet at 7:30 p.m. today at Sumac Elementary School to begin 
working for new legislation that would prevent a concentration of group homes 
in neighborhoods. State law requires only that they be 300 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
Group homes are licensed by the state Department of Social Services and are 
monitored by local probation departments and other child-placement agencies. 
They do not require operating permits from cities or counties. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway house operators, who are paid $1,200 to $2,000 per month per child, 
deny that their homes represent a threat to neighborhoods. Operators say the 
teen-agers are watched closely, are not allowed to go out unsupervised and are 
subject to frequent drug tests. The juveniles range in age from 12 to 17 and 
come from communities throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet bedroom communities such as Agoura are a perfect place for the 
teen-agers' rehabilitation, which is usually supervised by clinical 
psychologists, said Shirley Juels, who operates a program called Passageway 
from two Agoura homes and plans to soon open a third home. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids need to know and experience what a normal home environment and high 
school is," Juels, of Chatsworth, said Tuesday. "Agoura is a good setting. 
That's the reason I'm there." 
</P>
<P>
Near two of Juels' Agoura Hills sites, a separate home is operated in the 
unincorporated Agoura neighborhood of Oak Park by an organization called 
Calabasas Academy. That group also houses children at its headquarters in 
Calabasas and in a group home in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Calabasas Academy on Tuesday declined to discuss her 
organization, its program or tonight's meeting. "It's been such a horrible, 
horrible situation. I just can't talk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Wiesbrock, a vice president of the Fountainwood Homeowners Assn., said 
tonight's meeting was prompted by neighborhood concern. She said some 
homeowners are nervous over new disclosure laws that require home sellers to 
notify buyers of any problems that affect their house. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said they are nervous over the halfway houses' impact on 
Agoura's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Kobabe, director of special pupil services for the Las Virgenes Unified 
School District, said his staff handles educational testing for teen-agers from 
both Passageway and Calabasas Academy. He said special education costs outstrip 
the amount of state funding his school district receives. 
</P>
<P>
Kobabe said that halfway house operators have been cooperative, but that many 
of the youths require special education tutoring. "The more who do, the more 
our special ed classes become inundated and crowded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no incidents involving Passageway teens in Agoura Hills, said 
City Manager David N. Carmany, who will attend tonight's meeting along with Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Frank Sobisky. "I think these kids are getting 
a second chance that they deserve," Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Authorities 
</P>
<P>
In Oak Park, which is in Ventura County, John Bryan, who lives near the 
Calabasas Academy home, said he called sheriff's deputies about the teen-agers 
congregating in the home's back yard and smoking cigarettes at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Social Services officials said they had received no complaints about the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Laux, a supervisor at the department's Santa Barbara office, which licenses 
homes in Ventura County, said the only complaints about the Oak Park home were 
made as it was being licensed before opening Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shetka, a supervisor at the Social Services office in Culver City, which 
licenses homes in Los Angeles County, said his office had received no 
complaints regarding Agoura group houses. He said single-family neighborhood 
settings are an ideal place "to normalize these kids' lives and square them 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Young, who helps run the state licensing program from Sacramento, said 
there are 1,536 group homes housing 14,750 teen-agers in the state. "We don't 
have the authority not to license because the community doesn't want it there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway house operator Juels said she has empathy with her Agoura neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say if they moved next to me I wouldn't have some thoughts about it," 
she said. "But we're not talking about hardened criminals here. These are your 
kids and mine."

TOWN BOWS TO PRESSURE; BANS SALE OF FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando City Council, bowing to an ultimatum from the city of Los 
Angeles, ended a 40-year tradition Tuesday night by banning the sale of Fourth 
of July fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member council voted unanimously to renew the city's contract with the 
Los Angeles Fire Department, which had said it would not continue to extend 
service to San Fernando if the fireworks sales continued. 
</P>
<P>
After studying other options, San Fernando officials concluded that the Los 
Angeles Fire Department provides them with the best available service at the 
lowest possible cost, Mayor Roy Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the bottom line is my own feeling of responsibility to the people and 
businesses in San Fernando -- what is going to protect them the best and cost 
the least amount of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To substitute for the fireworks sales, the council voted to explore offering a 
fireworks show on the Fourth of July. It also voted to increase police patrols 
on the Fourth to guard against the use of illegal fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending that council members renew the contract, City Administrator 
Donald E. Penman said that losing fire protection from Los Angeles would be "a 
step in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles' ultimatum "does not set well with many people . . . 
fireworks sales should not dictate a critical decision affecting public health 
and safety," Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue came up last summer when the Los Angeles City Council and the Fire 
Commission voted to refuse to renew a 10-year-old fire-service contract unless 
San Fernando stopped permitting the sale of fireworks the week before the 
Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of $1.4 Million 
</P>
<P>
Under its existing contract, which expires June 30, San Fernando pays $1.4 
million a year for the protection. 
</P>
<P>
The five council members said they are uncomfortable with the Los Angeles 
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like people from the outside telling us what to do," Councilman Evelio 
Franco said. "It's a shame to lose a tradition, but we do need the best fire 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
The council directed city staff to ask the Los Angeles Fire Department to study 
building a fire station in San Fernando. The nearest stations are in Sylmar and 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, about 20 community organizations have depended on annual profits 
from the sale of fireworks, with several groups earning as much as $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
But because fireworks are illegal in the surrounding city of Los Angeles, San 
Fernando's tradition has long irritated Los Angeles officials. Faced with Los 
Angeles' threat, the San Fernando council last summer ordered a study of 
fire-service alternatives but found that its choices were limited. 
</P>
<P>
City officials determined that it would cost $500,000 a year to operate their 
own fire department, with initial equipment costs ranging from $1.5 million to 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
And a San Fernando fire department could not provide the same levels of 
service, equipment and staffing available from the mammoth Los Angeles 
department, according to a city report. Scaled-down city fire service would 
result in a 10% to 20% increase in fire insurance rates for businesses, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also explored contracting with the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department. But they said county fire service would cost at least $2.2 million 
annually. And there was no certainty that the county would take on an 
additional area, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In a public hearing last week, 14 people spoke in favor of fireworks sales, 
even if it meant losing Los Angeles fire protection. City transcripts of their 
testimony showed that 12 of them did not live in San Fernando but were leaders 
of community groups that benefit from the sale of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
To help them recover funds lost from the ban, the groups will be permitted to 
set up booths at San Fernando's annual summer fiesta, Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 people at the hearing who favored retaining Los Angeles fire protection 
are San Fernando residents, the records show.

25-YEAR ROADS TAX PROPOSED IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ballot measure was proposed Tuesday that would ask homeowners in the 
congested Santa Clarita Valley to add from $75 to $200 to their property-tax 
bills annually for the next 25 years to pay for new roads. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Garasi, spokesman for a subcommittee of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Transportation Committee, which made the proposal, said that taxing existing 
homeowners would generate $41 million by 2010. Another $115 million to $200 
million would be raised from future homeowners, assuming that a projected 
48,000 new residential units are built by 2010, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent yearlong study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
estimated that the valley would need $340 million for construction of new 
streets and highways by 2010. A separate report by the Automobile Club of 
Southern California put the figure at $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We would still need all the help we can get from the state and the county," 
Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee, which is chaired by Connie Worden, a Santa Clarita city 
planning commissioner, will present the proposal to the Santa Clarita City 
Council on Jan. 24. Garasi said the plan will also be submitted to Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi predicted that the council will react favorably to the proposal because 
its members have made roads their top priority and are looking for ways to fund 
them. But, he added, "We're not looking for the city to support it, only to put 
it on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Jo Anne Darcy said that the council members have not yet 
discussed the proposal. "We certainly would set up a study session on it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the proposed ballot measure calls for the city and county to form a 
joint-powers agreement for constructing roads in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee proposed that the measure be put on the November ballots for 
the city and for the unincorporated county area of the valley. The measure 
would require a favorable two-thirds vote in an area coinciding with the 
boundaries of the William S. Hart Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The Hart district serves students in Val Verde, Castaic and other 
unincorporated county areas, as well as in the communities of Newhall, 
Valencia, Canyon Country and Saugus, which comprise the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
J.J. O'Brien, a retired California Highway Patrol captain who heads the 
Transportation Committee, said that funds raised by the tax would be a start. 
"When you can come up with matching funds, you have a better chance of 
obtaining state or county funding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said the issue will be "a tough sell" to voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the voters will be convinced to do something about the traffic 
congestion up here instead of just bitching about it all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) put it best in a speech in the area last 
month, O'Brien said. "Davis said if you want it, you're going to have to pay 
for it," O'Brien recounted. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the school fees on new development that were approved by voters in 1987 
and are being challenged in the courts, the road tax would be on all 
homeowners, not just newcomers, Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, residents would be taxed according to the sizes of their 
homes. Senior citizens would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Committee is an offshoot of the Canyon Country and Santa 
Clarita Valley chambers of commerce. The boards of both chambers unanimously 
endorsed the proposal Tuesday, Garasi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all created it," Bonnie Bernard, executive director of the Canyon Country 
chamber, said of the proposal. "We all should pay for it. We all moved here 
from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
The valley has an estimated 38,000 housing units.

PUREBRED STALLION STOLEN IN RAMONA IS FOUND GALLOPING IN SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A purebred Peruvian Paso horse valued at $35,000 to $40,000 that was stolen 
Sunday in Ramona was found running down a street in Spring Valley on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken and Lyn Akins, keepers of the horse, said Celtrivo, a jet-black stallion 
that had been loaned to them, was stolen from their ranch on Old Julian Highway 
while they were visiting friends in Rancho California. 
</P>
<P>
The Akinses have eight horses, which they use in an animal-assisted therapy 
program for Broad Horizons, a residential treatment facility for problem 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone cut the lock and just walked off the property," Lyn Akins said. "It 
was the perfect crime. They waited (until) we were out of town." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department substation in Ramona had no clues in the theft. "There 
were no footprints and no tire tracks. The ground is frozen cold up there," 
Deputy Roy Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
The teens in the program were devastated when they learned the horse was 
missing, Akins said. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't understand why anyone would take one of their 'babies,' " she 
said. "They violated our privacy and our lives by taking something that meant 
so much to us." 
</P>
<P>
Akins said the therapy program, begun two years ago, exposes troubled 
teen-agers to animals as a means of helping them resolve their problems. About 
35 youngsters participate in the program, having been referred by doctors, 
psychiatrists or court order to the 9-acre ranch for stays of six months to a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"They care for the horses and a bonding forms," Akins said. "They learn 
discipline. They have to listen to instruction, they have to respect the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for self-esteem. It's hard to believe animals can be an important 
part of therapy, but the animals love unconditionally and give unconditionally. 
No matter what that child has done, the animal still loves him." 
</P>
<P>
The horse, found at Bancroft Drive and Troy Street in Spring Valley, was taken 
to the South County animal shelter in Bonita, where he was in good condition 
Monday night, said Lt. Janeen Reed of the animal control department. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe they found him, I just can't believe it," Akins said. "The 
finding of him is as mysterious as the stealing of him." 
</P>
<P>
"With all the publicity out," her husband said, "the (thief) may have panicked 
and didn't want to be caught with the horse."

PLAN TO ZONE WARNER RIDGE FOR HOUSING ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to restrict development of Woodland Hills' Warner Ridge property to 
single-family houses gained ground at Los Angeles City Hall on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But a fight by some homeowners to block a proposed office complex is far from 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 12 to 0 to tentatively approve changing the city's 
master plan to require single-family houses instead of commercial development 
on the hilly, 22-acre site at the eastern edge of Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The action was requested by Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the area. 
Council members customarily defer to the member whose area would be the site of 
a project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Picus, who faces reelection April 11, has been under pressure from homeowners 
to oppose a proposal by developer Jack Spound to build a nine-building, 
$150-million office complex with up to seven stories on the site at the 
northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and Oxnard Street. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said Tuesday that he will seek to overcome Picus' opposition when the 
city Planning Commission considers the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the master plan will require another council vote, as well as approval 
of the commission and Mayor Tom Bradley. If Bradley and the commission 
disapprove of the change, Picus will need 12 votes -- instead of the usual 
eight -- from the 15-member council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has not taken a position on the change, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not giving up," said Spound, who has hired lobbyists to help persuade 
city officials to approve his development. He said the council action 
"significantly prejudices our ability to get a fair hearing" before city 
planners on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Spound has contended that Picus' opposition is a "move to protect herself from 
attack by rival candidates in the upcoming council election." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Use Backed 
</P>
<P>
Spound noted that a citizens advisory committee appointed by Picus has backed 
commercial development of the property. Picus said she went against her 
committee because of overwhelming community opposition to Spound's project. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was supported at the council meeting by representatives of the Woodland 
Hills Homeowners Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said that a residential project on the site is not feasible because 
buyers would resist expensive single-family houses overlooking an industrial 
area. 'We would suffer a terrible economic loss," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"People would kill to own homes there," Picus said. "Single-family homes, no 
matter how expensive, are so much in demand that they would be snapped up."

BERNARDI ATTENDS 1ST MEETING SINCE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi returned to work Tuesday for the 
first time since being hospitalized for a cut to his head from a fall Jan. 4 at 
his Van Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel fine," Bernardi, 77, said at his first council meeting since the 
Christmas recess. 
</P>
<P>
The northeast San Fernando Valley councilman had been suffering from a flu-like 
virus when he fell and struck his head on a kitchen cabinet, causing a cut that 
required five stitches to close. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, the council dean with 28 years of service, faces 12 challengers in 
the April 11 election in the 7th District, which includes Sylmar, Pacoima, 
Arleta and sections of Lake View Terrace, Mission Hills, North Hollywood, 
Panorama City, Sepulveda, Sun Valley and Van Nuys.

TRACTOR-TRAILER HITS MOVING VAN, BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The northbound Golden State Freeway south of Parker Road in Castaic was 
partially blocked for about four hours late Tuesday afternoon after a 
tractor-trailer rig hit a moving van parked on the shoulder of the road and 
burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
George Spurgeon, 40, of Fontana, who was driving the tractor-trailer, let his 
rig "drift a little too far" to the right and struck the rear of the moving 
van, which had stopped because of brake problems, the California Highway Patrol 
said. Spurgeon's rig caught fire and came to rest in front of the moving van. 
</P>
<P>
Spurgeon suffered cuts on his head and right forearm. He was treated at Holy 
Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. The moving van did not catch fire and its 
driver was not injured, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
One to two lanes of the four-lane freeway were closed from 2 to 6 p.m.

GROUP LISTS 77 VEHICLES; 
</P>
<P>
REMOVAL OF DESERTED CARS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Valley organization of church and synagogue members Tuesday 
handed Los Angeles' parking administrator a list of 77 cars abandoned near 
their homes and asked that the city promptly remove such vehicles from city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 members of the Valley Organized In Community Efforts group told Robert 
Yates, the city's parking administrator, that abandoned cars left to rust and 
be stripped are harbingers of neighborhood decay and crime. 
</P>
<P>
"It really does blight a neighborhood," the Rev. Curtis Page, one of the 
organizers, said at the North Hollywood meeting. "Once an abandoned car is in 
place, it is not long before other cars are abandoned in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Page, pastor of Kirk O' the Valley Presbyterian Church, said VOICE members 
found the abandoned cars listed "in their normal travel around the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeated Calls 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cars had been on the streets for weeks, despite repeated phone 
calls to the city from residents, VOICE members said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods in Sun Valley have been particularly hard hit, said Tony O'Campo, 
a member of the group. He said that wrecking and dismantling businesses in the 
area seem to attract abandoned cars. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said his department will remove all of the 77 cars on VOICE's list that 
are determined to be abandoned. He conceded that the Valley has a large and 
growing problem with abandoned vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Yates noted that his department removes only 16% of the nearly 5,000 abandoned 
cars reported each month. The remaining cars are gone by the time investigators 
arrive or are removed after they are marked with a warning card that allows 
owners 72 hours to move them, he said. Yates said the city also receives 
thousands of calls a year about cars that turn out to be legally parked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Calls Unfounded 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go to so many calls that are unfounded that it impacts our ability 
to get to the true abandoned cars," Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said that his department, which impounds about 10,000 abandoned vehicles 
a year in the Valley, has upgraded computer equipment that will help speed 
investigations of abandoned-car complaints. He said residents will eventually 
be able call an 800 number to report abandoned cars to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Yates agreed to report to VOICE members next month on what happens to the 77 
cars and on when the 800 number will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Yates was the first action taken by the two-month-old VOICE 
group, members said. The group plans to develop programs to help stop blatant 
drug dealing and liquor sales to minors and to work against problems ranging 
from gang crime to religious discrimination, members said.

HAIR-RAISING FINISH FALLS SHORT FOR CLU IN 7TH LOSS IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
With Steve deLaveaga sporting a new crew cut Tuesday night, it would have been 
fitting had the Cal Lutheran men's basketball team adopted a new look as well. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately for the Kingsmen, deLaveaga's haircut was all that was new or 
different about Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen squandered an early lead, then staged a late rally before falling, 
83-79, to Fresno Pacific in a Golden State Athletic Conference game at Cal 
Lutheran. It was the Kingsmen's seventh consecutive setback since Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Cal Lutheran dropped to 6-11, 0-3 in GSAC play and dropped even 
further out of contention for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated," Fresno Pacific Coach John Moore said. "I kept saying to myself, 
'When are we going to be done with these guys.' DeLaveaga is such a great 
player he just scared the pants off me whenever he got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen's rally in the last 5 minutes had both Moore and the Sunbirds 
worried. After trailing by 10 points midway in the second half, Cal Lutheran 
closed to within a point in the final 3 minutes. Fresno Pacific padded its lead 
to 5 points before Cal Lutheran again rallied. 
</P>
<P>
After DeLaveaga's 3-point shot from behind the free-throw line cut the deficit 
to 81-79 with 14 seconds left, the Kingsmen were forced to foul and Donnie 
Johnson, who scored a team-high 21 points, made 2 free throws to give Fresno 
Pacific its winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We pushed it to the end, but we could not execute on a couple of our big shots 
when we needed to," said deLaveaga, who led all scorers with 31 points. "We dug 
such a deep hole for ourselves that we could not get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran jumped ahead at the outset and held a 7-point lead midway in the 
first half. The Sunbirds moved in front, 33-32, with 3:19 left in the first 
half and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was behind by only 4 points at halftime, 38-34, but could not 
overcome that deficit as both teams scored 45 points in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Three Kingsmen scored in double figures, including Mike Demeter with 18 points 
and Charles Jackson with 10. John Liddell had 19 points for Fresno Pacific 
(12-4, 3-0) and Troy Brown added 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno Pacific remains undefeated in conference play along with Westmont 
College and Southern California College.

Agoura 63, Nordhoff 61 -- The Chargers, who led by as many as 23 in the second

draw no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Jamil Austin had 27 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists for Canyon (10-6, 1-3),

3-1). Forward Brett Craig added 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete 88, Oakwood 75 -- Despite Mitchell Butler's game-high 35 points, the 
Gorillas (10-4) fell behind early in a nonleague game at Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete guard Jeff Zelenski made 4 of 5 3-point attempts and 10 of 10 free 
throws and finished with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete (14-1), ranked No. 7 in the Southern Section 2-A Division, made 28 of

BURROUGHS OUTLASTS HART, 88-79;

EJECTIONS AND FOULS MAR HEATED FOOTHILL LEAGUE SHOWDOWN

Two players were ejected and 4 fouled out Tuesday night as Hart High and 
Burroughs scratched and clawed their way toward the Foothill League summit. 
</P>
<P>
Elbows were thrown, shirts grabbed and words exchanged in a frenzied fourth 
quarter as the Indians from Burroughs (12-5, 4-0 in league play) held off the 
Indians from Hart, 88-79, at Burroughs to grab sole possession of first place 
and the inside track for their first league championship since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so long since we've been off to a 4-0 start," said Burroughs' Dan 
Murphy, who scored 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's 13 second-quarter points gave Burroughs a 45-37 halftime lead. The 
senior forward also was a cool and collective 6 of 6 from the free-throw line 
during the final-period pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
Have your score books ready? 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs forward Tom Clemons was ejected with 3 minutes to play after being 
called for a flagrant foul against Hart's Chad Fotheringham. Two minutes later, 
Fotheringham was ejected after a scuffle with Marnie Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's Brett Wilson (team-high 31 points) and Craig Gorski, and Burroughs' John 
Yim and Al Podrasky all fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, the officials still had the breath to whistle Fotheringham 
and Hart Coach Greg Herrick for technical fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Hart and Burroughs," Burroughs Coach Ira Sollod said. "They're always 
kind of at each other's throats." 
</P>
<P>
Said Murphy: "It kind of got out of hand. We don't like anyone trying to push 
us around. They tried to intimidate us." 
</P>
<P>
It almost worked. Hart (9-8, 3-1) fell behind, 9-1, in the first quarter and 
spent the rest of the game trying to get even. After a quarter, Burroughs led, 
23-15, and appeared to have the game iced after Murphy's second-quarter 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson scored 7 unanswered points to open the second half. Hart cut the gap 
to 1 point 4 times before Wilson's 3-point play with 4:26 remaining knotted the 
score, 69-69. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, however, never led and made only 4 of 10 free throws in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs made 15 of 19 free throws in the final quarter. Calderon, who buried 
4 3-point baskets -- for a season total of 33 -- and finished with 19 points, 
scored 7 fourth-quarter points to check Wilson's 9-point effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make our free throws and we turned the ball over," Herrick said. 
"That's the story of the game. I don't need to say anymore."

LANDRESS TO RETURN AS CLEVELAND FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Landress has ironed out differences with Cleveland High administrators 
and will return for his fifth season as the Cavaliers' football coach. 
</P>
<P>
Landress told school administrators last fall that he would quit at the 
conclusion of the season. But he reconsidered after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really frustrated during the season and I did quit," Landress said about 
a decision he had kept private. "But I thought things over and I decided I 
wanted to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Ida Windham agreed to take Landress back after a meeting Friday. 
Landress had requested the addition of on-campus coaches to the program, a 
condition satisfied when Lee Holden and Keith Wieser were promoted from the B 
team to the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Landress, who co-coached Manual Arts to City Section 3-A Division titles in 
1983 and 1984 with Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, led Cleveland in '88 to a 5-5 
record and a berth in the 4-A playoffs. JOHN LYNCH

USIU IS HEAVILY FAVORED AGAINST UCSD, BUT SERIES HISTORY IS 50-50

U.S. International University's game against UC San Diego might not appear as 
if it will be much of a contest. The NCAA Division I Gulls play host to the 
Division III Tritons tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But since USIU turned Division I in 1979, the teams have split six games. They 
each won once during the 1986-87 season (the Gulls won the last meeting, 
106-94). UCSD won both games in 1985-86, and USIU swept a 2-game series in 
1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls will be heavy favorites tonight -- Coach Gary Zarecky has the finest 
team in the 4 years he has been at USIU, and UCSD is rebuilding and 5-9 against 
mostly Division III opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons are led by 6-foot-8-inch center Gordon McNeill (12.5 points per 
game). USIU counters with a balanced attack that includes four players 
averaging in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams leads the team with 17.1 points, and Paul Wilson adds 16.5. Point 
guard Steve Smith is averaging 10.9 points, and forward Demetrius Laffitte is 
averaging 16 points and 10.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte needs 15 rebounds to move into fourth place on USIU's all-time list. 
He has 207 rebounds with 8 games remaining and has a chance to break the school 
record of 308 set by Don Robinson during the 1981-82 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls hope to tune up with UCSD and then await their rematch with Loyola 
Marymount in Los Angeles Jan. 31. The teams combined for an NCAA record 306 
points as Loyola won, 162-144, on Jan. 7.

<P>
 The Price Co., the San Diego-based operator of 41 Price Club discount 
warehouses, plans to distribute dividend-paying preferred shares to its common 
stockholders, the company said at its annual shareholders meeting Tuesday in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Subject to approval by shareholders and federal regulators, the distribution as 
planned would be one share of preferred stock for each five shares of common 
stock owned, or about 9.9 million preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
Each share would pay an annual dividend of $2.50 per share of preferred. 
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Robert Price said payment of the dividends are subject to 
certain profit goals of the company but unpaid dividends would cumulate for 
subsequent payment. 
</P>
<P>
The distribution itself will probably not be taxable to shareholders, although 
cash dividends on the preferred will be taxable as would sale of the preferred 
shares, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Price said the creation of the preferred stock "effectively separates 
participation in an annual yield from participation in the ongoing future of 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our shareholders have wanted us to pay a dividend for some time," 
Price said in a prepared statement. "But we have long felt that a common stock 
dividend was not appropriate for a growth company like ours. This procedure 
will provide for the equivalent of an annual dividend of 50 cents per common 
share, but shareholders who aren't interested in a dividend can sell the 
preferred and keep the common stock." 
</P>
<P>
A special shareholders meeting to vote on the stock issue will probably be held 
in March with the distribution, if approved, to follow in late March or April, 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co. stock closed up $.75 at $38.75 a share in over-the-counter trading 
Tuesday.

ROGER SIMON: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE INAUGURATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Simon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad Roger was all ready for George Bush's inauguration. He had on his tuxedo, 
his patent leather shoes and his cummerbund with the pink GOP elephants on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
He had everything, in fact, except an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"A mere oversight," Bad Roger said. "I am guessing that Lee Atwater will want 
to deliver it personally." 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger was not going to George Bush's inauguration. Good Roger was going to 
deliver food baskets to the poor instead. 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger is the kinder, gentler side of me. Bad Roger is the mean, nasty, 
take-no-prisoners side of me. And ever since Nov. 8 of last year, Bad Roger has 
sensed that America has swung his way. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes-sir-ree," Bad Roger said, "me and Lee Atwater symbolize the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Atwater was George Bush's campaign manager. He persuaded Bush to run a 
negative campaign and attack Michael Dukakis' patriotism, competence and 
sanity. Atwater will be installed as chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy is my hero," Bad Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize the disgusting cost of this wretched inaugural excess?" Good 
Roger said. "In 1977, Jimmy Carter spent $3.5 million. In 1981, Ronald Reagan 
spent $15.5 million and in 1985, he spent $20 million. But George Bush has 
decided to spend an obscene $25 million!" 
</P>
<P>
Bad Roger said, "All that money is coming from corporate giants and millionaire 
bigwigs." 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming from people who hope to curry favor with the new Administration to 
get huge government contracts later on," Good Roger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," Bad Roger said. "How else are we going to get $600 toilet seats 
for our jet planes?" 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger was really angry now. "And don't forget the $7 million that is 
coming directly out of the taxpayers' pockets for this inaugural insanity," he 
said. "All those millions could be spent to improve the lives of unfortunate 
Americans instead on a bunch of drunks." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to read you something," Good Roger said, rummaging through a stack of 
newspapers. "Barbara Bush was asked if that $25 million could have been raised 
for the homeless. And she replied: 'No it couldn't, because you wouldn't raise 
the money for that purpose. These people are raising it because they worked 
years and years to elect a President.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And she's exactly right!" Bad Roger said. "You go to a bunch of Republican fat 
cats and say: 'Let's raise $25 million to help AIDS research and build homeless 
shelters.' And they'd look at you and say: 'Sorry, I got to mow the lawn.' Or: 
'Gee, I gave at the office.' " 
</P>
<P>
Good Roger shook his head sadly. "Listen to what is being assembled for this 
inaugural: Caterers using 60 trucks and 700 waiters will be serving 20,000 
meals. There will be 1,000 elephant-shaped cookies. Mussels will be flown in 
from New Zealand, shrimp from Alabama, crayfish from Louisiana and oysters from 
Maine. Sixty pounds of white truffles have been flown in from Paris at $400 a 
pound. Also 1,000 pounds of wild boar sausage, 1,080 quail eggs, more than a 
ton of Norwegian salmon." 
</P>
<P>
". . .Plus 800 quarts of raspberries and 7,000 bottles of wine," Good Roger 
said. "Can you believe this? Mitch Snyder, the homeless activist, has declared 
that such lavish spending 'is in extremely bad taste' in a city where 'human 
beings are freezing and eating out of garbage pails.' " 
</P>
<P>
For once, Bad Roger had no snappy comeback. "I do have one question," Bad Roger 
said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes?" Good Roger said, his heart swelling with joy. 
</P>
<P>
"Are the pleats on a cummerbund supposed to go up to catch the crumbs, or down 
so they fall on the floor?" 
</P>
<P>
Bad Roger and the Bush Era. A winning combination.

THE FACES BEHIND MANY NOTABLE CASES

The Courage of Their Convictions: Sixteen Americans Who Fought Their Way to the 
Supreme Court by Peter Irons (Free Press/Macmillan: $22.95, 420 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after starting law school, I was delighted to discover that the case 
law of the American judicial system amounts to a mammoth library of dramatic 
narrative. Each opinion of an appellate court arises from a "case or 
controversy" -- that is, a struggle between human beings over love, money, 
liberty or power -- and each case book is rather like a collection of short 
stories. To this day, if I lack for quick leisure reading, I will pull a copy 
of California Reports off the shelf of my law library and read a case at 
random. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Irons approaches the daunting subject of constitutional law with a 
similar (if distinctly weightier) attitude in "The Courage of Their 
Convictions." He reminds us that much of the recent struggle for civil rights 
and personal liberty in contemporary America has been conducted in the 
courtroom, and he encourages us to look beyond the headlines and the op-ed 
pieces to see the intimate human values that are often at stake in a 
constitutional lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost without exception, the notoriety of Supreme Court cases is matched by 
the obscurity of the people who began them," Irons explains. "What little we do 
learn is distorted by the media's lust for the sensational and the trivial." 
His solution is to allow 16 otherwise anonymous constitutional litigants -- 
"women and men . . . black, white, Hispanic and Asian . . . gay and straight . 
. . carpenters, bartenders, doctors and lawyers" -- to speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just the Facts 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 16 cases is treated in two parts -- first, Irons narrates the facts 
of the case and discusses the holding of the Supreme Court, and then the man or 
woman behind the lawsuit gives a first-person account of his or her experiences 
as a "test case." In that sense, "The Courage of Their Convictions" is a kind 
of annotated oral history of constitutional law in America -- a footnote that 
gives a name and a face, a heart and soul, to what Irons characterizes as "a 
living Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
At its best, the book reveals and explains the scholarly but spirited debate -- 
and the considerable intellectual contortions -- that are the stuff of a 
judicial decision. At the same time, Irons allows us to understand that the law 
has an intimate and sometimes overwhelming impact on the human beings whose 
lives and liberty are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"We live by symbols," Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote (quoting his "judicial 
hero," Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes) in an 8-to-1 decision upholding the 
expulsion of a schoolgirl named Lillian Gobitis, a Jehovah's witness, for 
refusing to salute the flag in a Pennsylvania schoolroom in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved school," Lillian Gobitis recalls of her childhood ordeal. "I was 
actually kind of popular. And I felt that, 'Oh, if I stop saluting the flag, I 
will blow all this!' And I did." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Test Case 
</P>
<P>
We hear, too, from Gordon Hirabayashi, a college senior who refused to sign up 
for "relocation" after Pearl Harbor: "I had no plans to being a test case," he 
recalls. "I was so naive, I'd never even seen a jail." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jane Hodgson is a physician who challenged a Minnesota law against 
abortion: "It gradually dawned on me that this was lousy medicine we were 
practicing, and something ought to be done about it. But I never thought I'd 
see it in my day. I thought it would take forever." 
</P>
<P>
Elmer Gertz is a Chicago lawyer who helped to change the laws of libel in 
protracted litigation against the John Birch Society: "One interesting thing 
about the case is that actually my earnings did not decrease. They went up!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Door ... Opened' 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Hardwick is an Atlanta man whose arrest on charges of sodomy 
prompted a recent unsuccessful attack on laws against private sexual conduct: 
"The door . . . .opened up and I looked up and there was nobody there. I just 
blew it off as the wind and went back to what I was involved in . . . I heard 
another noise and I looked up, and this officer is standing in my bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Irons, a draft resister in the 1960s and a Harvard-trained civil rights lawyer 
today, teaches political science at UC San Diego. He is the author of "Justice 
at War," a chronicle of the unsuccessful legal challenges to the wartime 
internment of Japanese Americans. So we should not be surprised that his book 
focuses exclusively on what he characterizes as "some of the deepest and most 
enduring divisions among Americans -- those of religion and race, protest and 
privacy," as he puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should we be surprised that the book reads all too often like a 
friend-of-the-court brief for the litigants and their causes. Irons is an 
unabashed activist, and he concludes his book with a call to further activism 
in the courts: "All we can hope is that Americans like the people in this book, 
people with both courage and conviction, will continue to bring these issues to 
the courts, and that judges will look behind the 'masks of the law' to see the 
many faces of America."

LATEST PLAY IN AUGUST WILSON SAGA OF BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles has seen two plays by August Wilson: "Fences" at the Doolittle and 
"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" at the Los Angeles Actors Theatre. San Diego also 
knows Wilson from having had "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" in '88 at the Old 
Globe Theatre. (LATC will stage it this spring.) Pretty fair country plays. 
</P>
<P>
But only warm-ups -- finger exercises -- for "The Piano Lesson." 
</P>
<P>
It opened at the Goodman Theatre here Monday night, the holiday honoring the 
birth of Martin Luther King Jr. This was no coincidence. Like King, Wilson 
shows the black experience as part of the American experience, without losing 
sight of what makes the black experience special. 
</P>
<P>
Take the moment when the uncle in the play (Paul Butler) starts to trace the 
history of the strangely carved piano that his grown-up niece (S. Epatha 
Merkerson) and nephew (Charles Dutton) are fighting over. 
</P>
<P>
The story goes back to the days of slavery. "See," he begins, "our family was 
owned by a fellow named Robert Sutter. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that this remark should ring a bell for the black people in 
the audience, as a post-performance discussion at Sunday night's preview made 
clear that it did. 
</P>
<P>
What's interesting is that it also rings a bell for the white viewer. He is 
suddenly certain that at some point along the line his family, too, was owned 
by somebody. 
</P>
<P>
The intuition has got something to do with the matter-of-fact way that Lewis 
reads the line. He's not commenting on the evils of slavery; he is simply 
noting that all families were once slaves. So why should your family have been 
spared? 
</P>
<P>
Other bells get rung when Lewis opens a bottle and the stories really start to 
flow. How Grandpa told off The Man when he tried to pay him for a whole season 
of work with $50 and a bottle of liquor -- an Irish story, surely. This play 
could make you believe in the collective unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it would be condescending to say that "The Piano Lesson" is about "all of 
us." All of us didn't see our fathers burned to death for having stolen back 
the piano that his father had carved for The Man. Wilson is writing about a 
particular black family living in Pittsburgh in 1936: part of his grand scheme 
to write a play about black life in every decade of the 20th Century. He keeps 
his feet under his characters' kitchen table at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't stop with that. Kitchen-sink plays are fine, but Wilson is also 
on the trail of the Furies here, just as Aeschylus was in "The Oresteia." And 
he doesn't see any contradiction in that. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeks believed in the unseen, after all. So do the people in this house. 
When a ghost appears on the top landing, they're startled, but they're not 
surprised. Given the piano's fatal history, it makes sense for a ghost to show 
up. But how do they get rid of him? 
</P>
<P>
This leads to a problematic final scene that Wilson and director Lloyd Richards 
will probably continue to work on during the play's Chicago run. (The show is 
being presented at the Goodman as a work-in-progress, just as "Fences" was.) 
</P>
<P>
The closing attempts to put the play on a new supernatural plane. But it looks 
like a way of slipping past the need to answer what one took to be the play's 
basic question: Who gets the piano -- Berniece or Boy Willie? 
</P>
<P>
An answer is implied. But we'd really like to have it straight out. If a way 
could be found to do this without compromising the supernatural element in the 
play, "The Piano Lesson" will become an American classic. 
</P>
<P>
Boy Willie, as played by Charles S. Dutton, will become a classic American 
character. At first, this big-talking country boy with a truck full of 
watermelons seems to be every bit the blowhard that his sister claims he is. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Actor Dutton makes it clear that the man is not just running his mouth. 
He knows what he's doing. He sells those melons -- just as he said he would. He 
finds a buyer for that piano -- just as he said he would. 
</P>
<P>
And he's going to deliver that piano, and get himself some land down home with 
the money. If his sister doesn't like that, she can shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
Boy Willie means it. His sister also means it. Her father's piano is not 
leaving this house. (Actress Merkerson is coming from an entrenched negativity 
that a brother's charm is not going to crack.) The issue is powerfully joined, 
with right on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
They are not just fighting about a piano. "The Piano Lesson" is about the 
allure of totems and the need to get past them -- and yet honor them. As in 
"Joe Turner's Come and Gone," Wilson's play says that there are forces out 
there that can do us real harm unless we learn to respect them. 
</P>
<P>
Not since O'Neill has America had a playwright with such a firm belief in 
mystery. Happily, Wilson enjoys listening to his characters rather than 
dictating large statements, so we don't get a lot of talk about mystery. 
Melons, yes. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is yeasty and funny, and it's handed around to an interesting 
circle of subsidiary characters -- not subsidiary in their own minds, of 
course. Like Boy Willie, none of these people is the stereotype that he at 
first suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Lymon (Rocky Carroll) isn't Boy Willie's brainless stooge, but a quiet young 
man who knows how to size up a situation: He should do well in the city. Avery 
(Tommy Hollis) isn't your standard fake preacher: He really does believe that 
Jesus came to him in a dream, and he tells it amazingly well. 
</P>
<P>
Wining Boy, the piano player (Lou Myers), is a drifter who loves to come home. 
His brother Doaker, the railway cook (Paul Butler), is a homebody who loves to 
go out on the road. Even Grace, Willie Boy's one-night stand (Tonya Pinkins) 
has something to say for herself -- plenty, in fact. Not so Maretha, Berniece's 
daughter (Tressa Janaee Thomas), but she's only 9. 
</P>
<P>
They come and go, but under Richards' direction they are unquestionably a 
family, picking up the conversation where they left it, which may have been 
three years ago. We also get a sense of all the shirttail cousins down-home. 
"The Piano Lesson" knows its people, knows the world, generates even more 
energy than "Fences" and does, after all, cross the finish line. You just wish 
the end were as strong as the rest of the journey.

OPERA REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
THE MET GOES MODERN -- AFTER A FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the major houses in the world, the Metropolitan Opera must be the most 
conservative. It is a matter of tradition, of taste and of finance. 
</P>
<P>
By most standards, the double bill that was introduced Monday night at Lincoln 
Center would seem a timid gesture. Bela Bartok wrote "Bluebeard's Castle" in 
1911. Arnold Schoenberg completed "Erwartung" back in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
The mighty Met, however, had discovered "Bluebeard" only in 1974 and abandoned 
it after a dozen performances. The company had never touched a tone of 
Schoenberg until this momentous occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the occasion wasn't as daring as once envisioned. The two short 
operas originally were to have been complemented by a third -- either Debussy's 
"Le Martyre de St. Sebastien" or Dallapiccola's "Il Prigioniero." The 
theatrical mastermind for this stimulating juxtaposition was to have been the 
inevitably provocative Peter Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the not-so-well-laid plans were realized, however, the third act 
and the first director both fell victim to some weird operatic policies and 
politics. The Met finally settled for a smaller package of 20th-Century 
masterpieces and wrapped it in second-hand Eurotrash glitz. 
</P>
<P>
To stage the two surviving psychodramas, the management turned to Goran 
Jarvefelt, an internationally fashionable, mildly controversial gimmick 
specialist. For trendy modernist decors, the Met enlisted Hans Schavernoch and 
Lore Haas, set and costume designers who had performed similar service for 
Vienna three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To prove that it harbors no consistent concern for the validity of opera as 
comprehensible drama, the company offered "Bluebeard" in English but 
"Erwartung" in German. The program magazine didn't even deem it worthwhile to 
translate the title. Anyone for "Expectation"? 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the evening was reduced to an unorthodox indulgence for a 
misplaced prima donna, Jessye Norman, as accompanied by an inspired conductor, 
James Levine. The singing was variable. The playing was brilliant. The staging 
was pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
Jarvefelt (well remembered for the distortions of numerous Santa Fe efforts) 
and Schavernoch (well-remembered for the high-tech kitsch of his Bayreuth 
"Ring") have, of course, ignored the careful theatrical instructions outlined 
by the composers and librettists. 
</P>
<P>
"Bluebeard" no longer takes place in a dark castle chamber with seven 
mysterious doors. "Erwartung" no longer takes place in a nightmarish forest. 
Both operas are forced to inhabit the same shiny set, a mock-marble mausoleum 
equipped with sliding panels that can reveal missiles, branches, sci-fi 
panoramas, hootchy-kootchy dancers, piles of bloody gems plus other cheap and 
useful symbols. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bluebeard," the room is bare except for a podium that supports the 
protagonist. The protagonist, not incidentally, executes a profoundly 
significant partial strip-tease as each door to his psyche opens. Gosh. 
</P>
<P>
In "Erwartung," the room is strewn with bloody autumn leaves that surround a 
grand piano bedecked with a Liberacian candelabrum. A convenient corpse appears 
and disappears on cue, via trusty trap door. Ask not why. 
</P>
<P>
It is all very chic and very silly. The claptrap could even be funny if it 
weren't such an affront to Bartok's brooding, decaying romanticism and 
Schoenberg's febrile, ecstatic expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
In "Bluebeard," Samuel Ramey sang with nice, bland basso fortitude, 
demonstrated model diction, bared his chest proudly and even doffed his purple 
wig without cracking a smile. Still, it didn't mean much. 
</P>
<P>
As his hapless and chronically inquisitive bride, Norman offered more crooning 
and marking than genuinely expressive singing. She all but faked the climactic 
high C at the opening of the fifth door, and tended to hide under the 
orchestral blanket. She did, however, strike grandiose, statuesque poses. 
</P>
<P>
As the victimized heroine of Schoenberg's monodrama, she traced the mercurial 
vocal line with verve and reasonable accuracy. Even here, however, she seemed 
more intent on producing lush sounds than on portraying neurotic tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she made her loyal fans undeniably happy. The brave ones who stayed to 
the atonal end gave her the sort of ovation usually reserved for an Isolde or 
Elektra. The director and designer had to endure a few boos. 
</P>
<P>
And so Bartok and Schoenberg ended up providing a star turn for an 
old-fashioned diva. Only in New York. . . .

"Stay tuned" has a new meaning to a 19-year-old late-night disc jockey in Iowa 
City, Iowa. When Daryl Berryhill stepped outside to get a snack from his car 
about 2:40 a.m. Monday, the station door locked behind him. The last song ended 
. . . followed by 45 minutes of silence. . . . Berryhill broke glass in a back 
door and pried open a security cage, but was unable to open a second set of 
doors leading to the studio. Deputy sheriffs finally arrived to assist in the 
re-entry. ALEENE MacMINN

Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the long-feuding leaders of the Rolling Stones, 
are both expected to be on hand tonight in New York when the celebrated British 
rock group is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A source close to 
the band said, however, that the odds are against all five members of the 
Stones being on hand, so there probably won't be an official reunion on stage. 
But there are rumors of a reunion tour later this year. The band hasn't toured 
since 1981. Phil Spector, the reclusive, L.A.-based record producer whose "wall 
of sound" style was one of the most distinctive ever in rock, is also scheduled 
to attend. He was named a non-performing member of the hall of fame. ALEENE

FAMILIAR SHOWS STILL HEAD NIELSEN LIST

Television viewing patterns followed familiar patterns last week, with NBC and 
its "The Cosby Show" again proving to be the favorites among the households 
monitored by the A.C. Nielsen Co. NBC had six of the 10 most-watched programs 
in its column and averaged a 16.1 rating for the week, compared to 13 for ABC 
and 12.6 for CBS. (Each rating point represents 904,000 households). 
</P>
<P>
* ABC's medical drama "HeartBeat" hasn't won any hearts since rejoining the 
Thursday-night schedule two weeks ago. The show placed 72nd among the week's 81 
prime-time programs, attracting viewers in about 6.3 million homes, compared to 
about 26.9 million for the top-rated "Cosby Show."

JAZZ NOTES : CHARLIE SHOEMAKE BRINGS EDUCATION HOME; BAND LEADER BILL HOLMAN UP

As they have once a year for 15 years, be-bop-bent vibist-improvisation teacher 
Charlie Shoemake and his wife, singer Sandi Shoemake, last Sunday turned the 
living room and den of their Sherman Oaks ranch-style home into a makeshift 
jazz club. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemake, who appeared with George Shearing for seven years and who estimates 
that he has taught 1,500 students since he opened his home-based studio in 
1972, spotlighted some of his top past and present students in energized 
performances that ran through the afternoon into early evening, and drew more 
than 100 listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the student wailers, who ranged from novice to professional level, were 
pianist Art Gilbert, an associate justice for the State Court of Appeal, who 
acquitted himself nicely on "I Thought About You," and trumpeter Kye Palmer, a 
senior computer engineering major at Cal Poly Pomona, who crackled with 
brilliance on "Have You Met Miss Jones?" The steaming concluding set found 
trombonist Andy Martin, pianist Randy Cannon and tenorman Benn Clatworthy, all 
former Shoemake initiates who are now working pros, creating showers of sparks 
as they ripped through "Blue Bossa" and "There Is No Greater Love." 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Larance Marable -- a veteran who played with Charlie Parker and 
currently appears with Shoemake's quartet and Charlie Haden's Quartet West -- 
and bassist John Giannelli, who has served stints with Sarah Vaughan and Carmen 
McRae, were the affair's supporting rhythm duo. Both said there were many 
rewards for the afternoon's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids were great," Marable said. Giannelli found that "when the musicians 
give 100% enthusiasm, as they did here, it really makes it fun to play." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemake -- who played on the sound track to "Bird" and whose latest LP, 
"Stand-Up Guys" (Chase Music Group), with local tenor giant Harold Land in the 
front line, is due out in two weeks -- thought the get-together "was one of the 
better ones. I'm just trying to get (the students) to play well and enjoy the 
music," he said. "It's hard getting work, and I hope something happens for 
them, but the main thing is to enjoy the music." 
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY UPDATE: Composer-arranger-tenor saxophonist-bandleader Bill Holman, who 
was one of those in the audience at the Shoemake bash, has been nominated for a 
Grammy for best big band performance for his recent JVC debut, "The Bill Holman 
Band." One of a handful of Angelenos nominated for 1989 Grammies in several 
jazz categories (Peggy Lee, Carmen McRae, John Patitucci, David Benoit, Tom 
Scott, Chick Corea and the Yellowjackets are others), Holman won a 1988 Grammy 
for best instrumental arrangement for a version of "Take the 'A' Train," which 
was recorded by Doc Severinsen's "Tonight Show" Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Holman -- who first gained attention for his stellar writing for Stan Kenton in 
the '50s and then for Gerry Mulligan, Terry Gibbs and Woody Herman in the '60s 
-- welcomed the nomination, saying, "It could draw the attention of a lot of 
people who otherwise might not have known about the band." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County native Holman faces plenty of stiff competition from the other 
nominations, which include "Tribute to Count Basie," Gene Harris Big Band 
(Concord); "Jacquet's Got It!" Illinois Jacquet Big Band (Atlantic); "Bud &amp; 
Bird," Gil Evans Orchestra (Intersound); and "Ebony," Woody Herman's Thundering 
Herd (RCA/Victor). 
</P>
<P>
"Illinois' record has been very popular out here," Holman said, "but I figure 
Gene Harris is going to be the one to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Having led his current unit since 1975, Holman believes in keeping his troops 
in shape. Each week he gathers such regulars as reedmen Bob Cooper, Lanny 
Morgan and Bob Militello, trumpeters Frank Szabo and Carl Saunders and 
trombonist Bob Enevoldsen for rehearsals at the Musicians' Union on Vine Street 
in Hollywood, whether the band has an engagement or not. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time we take a break is for the holidays, or when I'm out of town," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The composer is now "fishing around for ideas, actually just getting started" 
on a long original piece for altoist Phil Woods, to be performed with the West 
German (Radio) Network big band. In April, Holman makes his eighth trip in as 
many years -- all at the behest of WGN -- to Cologne, West Germany, where he'll 
conduct the Woods work, as well as arrangements of several standards, for a 
live radio broadcast. "This is the kind of commission that keeps me going," 
Holman said. "It's a good chunk of employment that takes up about a quarter of 
the year, plus it's a chance to work with Phil." (Woods opens at Catalina Bar 
&amp; Grill on Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS: "Michel Camilo" (Portrait), an exceptional debut 
release of mostly trio outings from the pianist who wrote "Why Not?" a Grammy 
winner in 1983 when sung by the Manhattan Transfer, and who gained renown 
touring with Paquito D'Rivera. "Suite Sandrine, Part One" finds Camilo, a 
modernist in the Herbie Hancock vein, roaring but with grace, and "Blue Bossa" 
is a flavorful duet with Monga Santamaria. . . . "Blue to the 'Bone" 
(Milestone) is quite satisfying meat-and-potato blues-and-standards fare from 
organist Jimmy McGriff. Trombonist Al Grey's plunger work lights up "Ain't That 
Funk for You?" a make-you-smile shuffle, while guitarist Melvin Sparks gleams 
on the oh-so-slow "Hangin' In." McGriff and his longtime sidekick, altoist Hank 
Crawford, roll into Marla's Memory Lane this Friday and Saturday. . . . "Great 
Moments in Jazz" (Atlantic) gathers some of that label's ace jazz hits, like 
Shorty Rogers' "Martians Go Home," Charles Mingus' "Wednesday Night Prayer 
Meeting," John Coltrane's "My Favorite Things" and the Manhattan Transfer's 
"Birdland." The cuts are so nicely sequenced, you might imagine a disc jockey 
like Chuck Niles or Jim Gosa (both from KKGO-FM) was right there in your living 
room, playing the tunes for you.

'BAKA': CAPTIVATING LOOK AT ANOTHER CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes the best story is the one simply told. Case in point: "Baka: People 
of the Forest," an hourlong "National Geographic" special airing tonight at 8 
on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
"Baka" is a straightforward look at the lives of a small group of pygmies in 
southeastern Cameroon and, in this case, straightforward does not mean dull: 
"Baka" is an understated, captivating study of another culture. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-writer Phil Agland and associate producers Lisa Silcock and Michael 
Harrison -- all of whom lived with the Baka for two years -- have produced a 
rare, poignant glimpse into the everyday life of a little-known tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrating on the lives of one family -- Likano, his wife, Deni, and their 
sons, Yeye and Ali -- "Baka" fully engages the viewer while showing the story 
of this hunter-gatherer society through the family's words and actions. 
Following the family as they search for the peke fruit, a staple of their diet, 
prepare natural medicines, and get ready for Deni's coming child, "Baka's" 
recording of the similarities between modern culture and this "primitive" 
society are striking. 
</P>
<P>
The family is only a peripheral part of one riveting sequence, waiting on the 
ground while a determined villager climbs a 140-foot-tall tree -- a perilous 
barefoot ascent that takes several hours -- to raid a bee's nest of its honey. 
The climber stuns the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound, just one 
example among many of the wondrous pharmacopeia of the Baka. 
</P>
<P>
"Baka" touches on the greatest problem facing the Baka -- the destruction of 
their homeland, the rain forest -- with a nice subtlety that other documentary 
makers could do well to study: The subtitles let the pygmies speak for 
themselves and the narration (by actor Denzel Washington) contains little 
strident preaching. 
</P>
<P>
Through its unadorned scenes of parents rearing children, friends talking and 
people working, "Baka" skillfully drives home its point: This endangered group 
of pygmies may seem exotic, but their humanity is universal. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

'REAL LIFE OF RONALD REAGAN' FALLS SHORT AS BIOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Where's the rest of me?!" Ronald Reagan cried in his role as an amputee in the 
film "King's Row." Reagan used the line as the title of his mid-'60s 
autobiography. It also applies to the "Frontline" documentary, "The Real Life 
of Ronald Reagan," narrated by Garry Wills, that airs at 9 tonight on Channels 
28 and 15; 10 p.m. on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
This biographical study at first appears to be the very model of thoughtful 
reportage. Reagan is documented from earliest childhood days (his father had a 
serious "drinking problem," and his family moved almost yearly during this 
time) all the way through to his rebound from the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative image is one of a superficial but quick-learning emcee taking 
complex ideas (already compressed by a brainy staff) and delivering them with 
the conviction of Jimmy Stewart and the charm of Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, the author of "Reagan's America," leaves it at that. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the rest of Reagan? An example of Wills' deletions is the George Gipp 
myth. Gipp was the ill-fated kicker and mascot played by Reagan in "Knute 
Rockne: All-American." Reagan used him as his guiding spirit of optimism and 
gumption, as Wills notes, for five decades. The crucial point missed by Wills 
is that the Gipp tale of the movie never happened. For Reagan, it was real; it 
was the metaphor of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Wills hints at other matters, then leaves them unexamined. On one hand, the 
popular conception of Reagan, and the model he played after the Jimmy Carter 
debacle, is the provider of paternal comfort. On the other hand, Reagan's life 
unfolds as a case of arrested adolescence. This conflict would seem to be 
considerable grist for a documentarian's mill. It's barely suggested by 
narrator Wills, whose tone of voice occasionally sounds like the intellectual 
exasperated at a small mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The Real Life of Ronald Reagan," in a now-hallowed tradition for the press, 
finally lets Reagan off the hook. ROBERT KOEHLER

A Delta Air Lines spokesman said that the carrier found emergency sprinkler 
system wiring errors in two of its Boeing 757s, corrected the problems and 
advised the Federal Aviation Administration. Similar problems in sprinkler 
systems in the planes were reported earlier in another Delta-operated 757, one 
belonging to Royal Brunei Airlines, two owned by Air Holland, and one operated 
by the British airline Air 2000. Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said in Atlanta that 
the problems would have prevented sprinklers from working properly in the event 
of a fire in a baggage hold. Lundy said it was a similar crossed-wiring problem 
found on a Delta plane before delivery from the Boeing factory that prompted 
the FAA last week to order inspections.

At least 51 people, including 35 schoolgirls, were killed when a train slammed 
into a crowded bus in southern Sri Lanka. About 72 bus passengers were injured 
in the accident at an unprotected level crossing at Ahungalle, 60 miles south 
of Colombo, the capital. No one on the train was hurt. The state-owned bus was 
carrying students from four local schools who were returning home from a visit 
to a clinic. The train, traveling about 50 m.p.h., crushed the bus and broke it 
in two, dragging part of it 250 yards.

China and Vietnam have tackled sensitive border issues in direct high-level 
talks in Beijing, diplomats said. Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Dinh Nho 
Liem arrived unannounced last weekend and began talks with his Chinese 
counterpart, Liu Shuqing. China's Foreign Ministry said the talks will cover a 
political settlement in Cambodia, but the two sides reportedly also discussed 
bilateral relations, including the Spratly Islands, claimed by both nations.

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said he wants to meet soon with North Korean 
leader Kim Il Sung to end 40 years of enmity between the two nations. Top 
leaders of north and south have never met. The north has agreed to the south's 
proposal for political and military talks by the two prime ministers, and Roh 
said at a news conference that he wants summit talks, too. Meanwhile, senior 
American and South and North Korean military officers discussed what officials 
in Seoul said was a possible agenda for reducing tensions along the border.

TOUR BOAT HITS SAND; 14 HURT

A Colorado River tour boat rammed a sand bar, tossing passengers from their 
seats and injuring 14 of 44 on board, authorities said. None of the crew or 
passengers on the two-hour sightseeing tour out of Laughlin, Nev., appeared to 
have life-threatening injuries, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman 
Jim Bryant. The injured were taken to Needles Desert Community Hospital. The 
boat was on a tour that normally leaves Laughlin, turns around under the London 
Bridge in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and returns to Laughlin. The boat, about 50 
feet long, is owned by Laughlin River Tours Inc., said a company official who 
refused to give her name or comment further. "They got down there and were 
coming back. The water is low now. The captain saw the sand and sped up the 
vessel to lift the boat over the sand bar," Bryant said. "But it didn't lift. 
It was going a pretty good speed. The people on board in chairs got tossed 
around like ballast," Bryant said.

Sen. Quentin Kopp of San Francisco said he plans to introduce a legislative 
package to abolish the embattled state Board of Equalization and the Franchise 
Tax Board and replace them with a Department of Revenue. Under Kopp's plan, the 
new department would be overseen by a commissioner appointed by the governor. 
Taxpayers wanting to fight the new department's rulings would be heard in a 
special tax court. The Board of Equalization has been the subject of numerous 
news reports aimed at showing that big taxpayers -- such as utilities and major 
corporations -- get property tax breaks after making campaign contributions to 
board members. One board member has also been tied to the three-year FBI sting 
operation aimed at legislators. Paul Carpenter, a former senator, received a 
$20,000 contribution in 1986 from a dummy company set up by FBI agents.

Gunmen assassinated an official of a Philippine government panel charged with 
recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth of ousted President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos and his associates, police said. A few hours after the slaying of Jesus 
Ronan, another member of the Presidential Commission on Good Government 
received a death threat, officials said. Ronan, 58, a former air force colonel 
and operations director of the commission, was shot twice in the head. There 
was no claim of responsibility, but Commissioner David Castro said Ronan was 
slain because he enforced orders to sequester companies that Marcos or his 
cronies are believed to have acquired illegally.

D.A., FBI TO INVESTIGATE LONG BEACH POLICE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL and CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating 
a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to 
shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to ask the district attorney's office 
to launch an independent investigation of the Saturday night incident, which 
was secretly recorded by an NBC television crew. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into 
the case at the request of the Long Beach police chief. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to review the matter to determine whether a criminal investigation 
is appropriate," Livesay said, adding that his office hopes to decide by Friday 
whether a full-fledged investigation is merited. If such an inquiry reveals 
that brutality was involved, either misdemeanor or felony charges could be 
filed against the officer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the 
man who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from 
the Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with 
two Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said. 
He refused to say who had requested the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an allegation of a civil rights violation and we opened a ticket on 
it this morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty 
old clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday 
night as the television crew followed behind in a van. The two men said they 
wanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group 
members by Long Beach police officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Tape Withheld 
</P>
<P>
While edited portions of the tape have been broadcast, Long Beach officials 
have said they need to see everything filmed by the NBC crew to move ahead with 
their own investigation of the incident. NBC officials have declined to release 
the full tape, saying that it would violate company policy to release unedited 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
A Long Beach assistant city attorney said his office is considering legal 
action to obtain the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell told NBC's "Today Show" on Tuesday morning 
that the two police officers had been suspended, Police Chief Lawrence L. 
Binkley said that the officers, Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey, will remain on 
duty at this stage of the investigation. They have, however, been reassigned 
from patrol duty to the detective bureau, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kell admitted later Tuesday that he was in error in his "Today Show" comments, 
but said he would favor firing the officers if it is proved that they used 
brutal tactics in dealing with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Unfortunate' 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's City Council meeting, the mayor called the incident "an 
unfortunate set of circumstances. We will not tolerate this. . . . We need to 
find out what happened here and make sure it never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the district attorney will add credibility to the city's 
own consideration of the brutality allegations, Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not unusual for the district attorney to look into allegations of police 
brutality, Livesay said, estimating that the office takes on four to six such 
cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
In determining whether a police officer has used excessive force, prosecutors 
have to decide whether the officer acted "without lawful necessity" in 
assaulting or beating a suspect. He declined to detail what would constitute 
unnecessary force, saying that it would be a "judgement call" by prosecutors 
based on the actions and statements of the police officers and suspects, and 
the injuries suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael Hannon, who is representing the two officers, said Tuesday 
that he will contest any allegations of brutality. He said the officers were 
"set up" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Have No Comment 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released a day after the incident, Long Beach police said that 
Jackson's and Hill's sedan was pulled over for weaving across the center line 
of the highway. They denied that Jackson's head was shoved through the window, 
saying that his elbow smashed the glass. On Monday, however, department 
officials stopped releasing that statement and said they would have no comment 
pending the outcome of their internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, a nonprofit 
group that investigates citizen complaints against law enforcement agencies, 
said the televised tape makes it clear that Dickey pushed Jackson's head and 
right arm through the window. Spokesman David Lynn maintained that Hill, the 
driver of the car, was not violating any traffic laws when he was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The group also complained that Dickey also used a string of obscenities in his 
conversation with Jackson, who was booked for suspicion of using offensive 
language, challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest. He was 
released on his own recognizance pending a Jan. 25 court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Smith, the only black member of the Long Beach City Council, said he 
found the tape "shocking." But other city officials argued that the television 
footage was not necessarily conclusive because it showed the altercation from 
only one angle and showed Jackson and Dickey only from the waist up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hard to tell what's happening below the waist," said Councilman Evan 
Anderson Braude, maintaining that it is vital that NBC release the rest of its 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concedes Error by Officer 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Hannon conceded that Dickey was wrong to spice his orders to Jackson 
with obscenities, but he said the cursing was evidence of discourtesy, rather 
than racism. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two officers saw the car weave within the traffic lane and wanted 
to check the driver for drunkenness. Although the two men in the car were 
black, driving an old car and dressed in shabby clothes, they were not stopped 
for those reasons, the lawyer said, adding that they were in a section of the 
city where their appearance was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they are not telling the truth when they say they did nothing to 
bring attention to themselves," Hannon said of Jackson and Hill. 
</P>
<P>
He said the two police officers become concerned for their safety when Jackson 
suspiciously exited the car as soon as it stopped, then immediately started 
arguing when Dickey ordered him to submit to a search for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proper Police Tactics' 
</P>
<P>
"The officer, using proper police tactics, pushed him up (against) the side of 
a building and unfortunately, the window broke," Hannon said. "I'm sure neither 
Mr. Jackson nor the officer wanted the window to break, because it was 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
He said Jackson had an eye for the camera when he screamed as Dickey moved him 
over to the police cruiser for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He said Dickey, who has been on the police force for four years, had one 
earlier complaint about his conduct, which was investigated by the department 
and determined to be unfounded.

ILLEGAL CITY CAMPAIGN GIFTS SLIP BY BECAUSE OF LACK OF ENFORCEMENT FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A voter-approved Los Angeles law aimed at curbing the influence of major 
campaign contributors has never received enough money to enforce it, and 
illegal gifts have made their way to candidates as a result, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The insufficient funding has caused a backlog of campaign audits in the city 
clerk's office. Because of the backlog, City Clerk Elias Martinez said Tuesday 
that at least two candidates in the 1987 city elections escaped possible 
criminal prosecution for receiving illegal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The law in question is a City Charter amendment approved by voters in 1985 that 
sets a $500 ceiling on campaign gifts to City Council candidates and $1,000 for 
citywide candidates. Candidates who knowingly accept gifts exceeding the limit 
are subject to criminal prosecution and could be sentenced to as much as six 
months in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The original law, however, had a statute of limitations of one year from the 
time of the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Recently completed audits by Martinez's office have found contributions 
exceeding the limit to 1987 council candidates Pat Russell, an incumbent who 
was defeated, and Councilman Robert Farrell. Assistant City Atty. Charles 
Goldenberg said the audit showed no evidence of criminal intent on the part of 
either candidate, but that in any case, prosecution would be impossible because 
of the statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
In Farrell's case, city attorneys said, about $5,400 was contributed in 
violation of the limit. Farrell said Tuesday that he will soon hold a 
fund-raiser so he can return the disputed contributions. Russell's 
contributions violating the limit amounted to about $38,000, city attorneys 
said. Russell, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, was quoted by the 
Herald-Examiner as saying the figure was "wildly inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the city elections this spring could add to the auditing backlog 
as scores of candidates vie for eight City Council seats and three citywide 
offices, including the mayor's. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg, noting that no one has been criminally prosecuted under the 1985 
law, acknowledged that it is difficult to prove that anyone intentionally 
received an illegal contribution. But he was optimistic that changes in the law 
approved by voters in 1987 will make future violations prosecutable. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 changes extended the criminal statute to two years and introduced a 
civil penalty mechanism that has a four-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Employees 
</P>
<P>
The audit by the city clerk's office is an essential part of enforcement. Under 
the law, the clerk's office must review each candidate's contributions 
statement before prosecution on an illegal campaign gift can begin. The audit 
determines whether an individual gave more than allowed or if, for example, a 
major contributor has circumvented the contribution limit through the use of 
employees or affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the first year the contributions limit law was applied, Martinez put 
in a budget request for 13 auditors to review the 1987 election reports. City 
records show that Mayor Tom Bradley agreed to only seven auditors and that the 
City Council reduced that to three. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the council's action was based on the theory that voters a few 
months later would approve the change in the criminal statute of limitations to 
relieve the pressure on the city clerk. While that is expected to improve 
enforcement of the law in subsequent elections, it is of little help for 
auditing the 1987 contests. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone raised the issue" of what to do about the 1987 elections, 
said Martinez's chief deputy, J. Michael Carey, adding that that included 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One-Year Statute' 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, added, "I don't think there's any question a one-year statute can't 
be complied with, given three (auditors)." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office did not warn the council that a prosecution might be 
jeopardized -- as it apparently has been -- unless Martinez received a larger 
auditing staff to review the 1987 campaign reports.

SEARCH FOR ELDERLY PILOT CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-day search for an elderly Hollywood pilot, who disappeared during a Jan. 
5 flight from Watsonville to Santa Monica, was called off Tuesday, Civil Air 
Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
It will resume only if U.S. Air Force officials determine there are remaining 
areas where the pilot, John Thompson, may have gone down but have not been 
searched, said Lt. Col. Bob Fowler of the Air Force auxiliary CAP. 
</P>
<P>
During the search, volunteers "used 195 aircraft . . . and were airborne a 
total of 818 flight hours," Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots based at Santa Monica Airport searched 13,650 square miles while taking 
several 300-mile trips between Watsonville and Santa Monica, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ground crews unsuccessfully searched mountaintops and other areas along the 
route where the pilot, in his 70s, was believed to have gone down in 
blizzard-like conditions.

ZZZZ BEST DEFENDANT DRAWS 30-DAY TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda gardener accused of helping two others launder nearly $500,000 in ZZZZ 
Best corporate funds through Las Vegas casinos during the waning days of Barry 
Minkow's carpet cleaning empire was sentenced Tuesday to 30 days in a halfway 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Lasko, 56, was only a minor defendant in the case that resulted in the 
conviction of 12 men on securities fraud, mail fraud and bank fraud charges 
after federal investigators learned that the Reseda-based ZZZZ Best was 
generating most its revenues through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Though prosecutors characterized Lasko as the "least culpable" of the 
defendants, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian sentenced him to a brief 
period of incarceration and also ordered him to perform 300 hours of community 
service and pay a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's going to walk," the judge said.

NEW LAPD OFFICERS TO BE GIVEN BERETTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police commissioners Tuesday approved the semiautomatic 
9-millimeter Beretta pistol as the primary department weapon and authorized 
issuing it to officer recruits to give them a better chance against heavily 
armed criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Robert Talcott called Police Chief Daryl F. Gates' request to 
begin furnishing the 16-shot Beretta to new officers "a response in a small way 
to try to meet the challenges on the street that officers face on a daily 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
The approval followed a two-year pilot program in which officers were allowed 
to purchase and use Beretta model 92F 9-millimeter pistols, rather than the 
six-shot, .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers they were issued by the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,600 of the department's 7,900 sworn officers reportedly switched 
during the program. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the Beretta is giving officers "a sense of confidence they did not 
have with a six-shooter." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Larry Fetters of the commission staff said other veteran officers may use 
the 9-millimeter weapon, but they must buy their own.

FIGURE IN COCAINE CASE GETS 4 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of acting as the Los Angeles overseer for a major international 
cocaine money laundering ring was sentenced Tuesday to four years in prison and 
ordered to pay a $25,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Ariano Jr., 28, arrested in a nationwide undercover sting nicknamed 
"Operation Cashweb," was accused of overseeing Southern California operations 
for a ring that laundered $36 million in cocaine proceeds during a nine-month 
period in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty to a single count charging him with laundering $300,250 in 
drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gordon Greenberg said videotapes introduced at trial 
showed that Ariano "actually enjoyed playing the role of the big shot" in 
meetings with undercover FBI agents, but that Ariano has since provided 
valuable evidence against even more culpable co-defendants in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only thing involved is greed," U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew 
said. "You wanted money. You got yourself involved."

TWIN SISTERS CREDIT LIBERALIZED SOVIET EMIGRATION POLICY WITH GIVING AILING ONE 
NEW CHANCE AT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Call it physiological perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
For Yelena Faynegold, the Soviet Union's policy of political restructuring and 
its easing of emigration restrictions has literally meant a new chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent move to United States enabled her to undergo a kidney transplant 
last week, with the help of her identical twin sister, Dina Vaisberg, who 
donated one of her kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeries were performed by Drs. Rafael and Robert Mendez, who are also 
identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pair Leave Hospital 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the 34-year-old sisters were discharged from St. Vincent Medical 
Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the operations went smoothly and, because of the close 
organ-match between the two, Faynegold's outlook for a normal life is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the sisters credit the changes brought about in the Soviet Union 
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to immigrate now," said Dina's husband, Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Having relatives in the United States and being Jewish also helped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Here for Nine Years 
</P>
<P>
Dina Vaisberg, who now lives in West Hollywood, emigrated nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After a year's wait, Faynegold was allowed to move here five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
If immigration had not been possible, the sisters said, Faynegold's prognosis 
would be much bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in her hometown of Odessa, on the Black Sea, did not diagnose her 
kidney disease, Faynegold said in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
It was an American doctor, based on information she provided her relatives in 
letters, who pinpointed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialist Left Town 
</P>
<P>
When, after much waiting and cajoling, she finally was admitted to a hospital 
in Moscow, the specialist Faynegold saw left the city the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, she recalled, a parade of doctors came by her bed in a crowded 
and dirty ward -- each telling her something different. The hospital's kidney 
dialysis machine was 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet hospitals also held other privations. 
</P>
<P>
"No TV," Faynegold said in English. "No bathrooms."

INS DENIES CHARGES OF STALLING ON AMNESTY OK NOTIFICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges by immigrant advocates that as many as 20,000 amnesty applications have 
been stalled in bureaucratic "limbo" were denied Tuesday by immigration 
officials, who said that they have begun implementing measures to better update 
applicants on the status of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Alva of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles charged 
that though the applications have been approved, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service has failed to notify applicants or provide them with 
their temporary residence cards. She said this has caused some to lose their 
jobs because some employers have refused to continue accepting temporary work 
permits that were issued to them earlier, pending a decision on their amnesty 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
"Some have been waiting up to a year to hear the result of their cases," Alva 
said at a morning press conference. "When they go to INS to ask, they're just 
told to go home and wait some more." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference later in the day, INS officials said the applications in 
question belong to immigrants who have moved and failed to notify the 
government of their new address. They said the 20,000 represent a tiny fraction 
of the more than 1 million applications filed in the INS western region during 
the one-year amnesty program that ended last May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Address' 
</P>
<P>
"If you haven't heard from us and you've moved . . . it's your responsibility 
to make sure the INS has your new address," said Western Regional INS 
Commissioner Harold Ezell, noting that change-of-address forms are available at 
government legalization offices. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the agency plans to conduct a public information blitz during the 
next two weeks to encourage applicants who have moved to fill out the address 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also plans to provide master lists of approved applicants so that 
immigrants can check for themselves on the status of their cases, he said. The 
lists will be available sometime in March at legalization offices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Gustafson, the INS' Los Angeles district director, said the status of 
applications is available through computers at INS legalization offices and 
that INS workers have the capability to make these checks for applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the offers, however, immigrant advocates contend that applicants often 
find it difficult getting assistance from clerks at understaffed legalization 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"These may be things proposed by INS, but it's just not happening," Alva said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who backed the coalition's 
demands for improved notification procedures, added that "we're not here to lay 
blame" for the applications that are "in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residence Cards 
</P>
<P>
"But people who have qualified for amnesty deserve to receive the (temporary 
residence) cards due them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that in an attempt to address such concerns, the agency plans to 
open a "problem window" at each legalization office by the end of the week to 
handle complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The INS officials also noted that applicants may telephone the INS hot line -- 
(800) 643-4800 -- for further information or the INS regional processing 
facility -- (714) 643-4800 -- for updates on the status of their applications.

PROGRAM LAUNCHED TO FIGHT PREJUDICE IN REGION'S SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,200 students, teachers and civic leaders gathered in front of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum Tuesday in the opening of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation 
League's "World of Difference" program, organized to fight racial, ethnic and 
religious prejudice in area schools. 
</P>
<P>
"(Los Angeles) is the most ethnically diverse city in the entire world . . . 
and unfortunately tensions still exist based on our racial and religious 
differences. Only through a better understanding of each other can we put these 
differences aside," Mayor Tom Bradley told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Before the mayor spoke, the crowd was entertained by a mariachi band, a gospel 
choir and a Jewish school choir. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinators of the yearlong program said it was conceived four years ago 
because of increasing racially motivated attacks among students across the 
nation. They said the program has already been successful in Miami and Boston, 
and they hope to reach hundreds of thousands of students in six Southern 
California counties through extensive media campaigns and teacher workshops. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be trainers of trainers," said Janet Himler of the ADL, which was 
organized 75 years ago to fight bigotry. "We will go out and train a core group 
of teachers, who will then go out and train others, and so on." 
</P>
<P>
Himler said that during the workshops, teachers will be given lesson plans 
designed to encourage their increasingly diverse students to talk about racial, 
ethnic or religious differences. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of the of 580,000 students in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
are minorities -- including Latinos, blacks, Asians, Pacific Islanders, 
Filipinos and American Indians. District officials expect that number to 
increase to 90% by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is going to teach us that whites are not the only people who 
matter in this world," said 13-year-old Susan Martin, a student at the 32nd 
Street USC Magnet School. "We need to learn to care about all kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
Some 20 protesters at the gala agreed but criticized the program for not 
addressing sexual and economic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect what the ADL is saying is that certain kinds of discrimination are 
taboo, but others are acceptable," said Enric Morello of ACT UP/LA, an advocacy 
group for AIDS victims. "They have excluded women, poor people, the homeless, 
people with AIDS and homosexuals, and they should all be included." 
</P>
<P>
David Lehrer, regional director of the ADL, said that his group focused its 
efforts on racial and religious bigotry because "that is our area of 
expertise." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The school districts involved in the program have agreed to target 
the other areas of discrimination because they are much more knowledgeable in 
those areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lesson for Parents 
</P>
<P>
"World of Difference" will be implemented in public, private and parochial 
schools throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
Harry S. Kilgo, coordinator of a Compton child care referral agency, said he 
hopes students will influence their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have parents who refuse to let minorities take care of their children, 
even though there is a severe shortage of day care providers," he said. "Young 
children seem to be blind to such differences. They just look at each other as 
people. We can learn a lot from them."

SLAIN MAN'S KIN OFFERED '7-FIGURE' SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state has offered a cash settlement of at least $1 million to the family of 
an off-duty Rapid Transit District bus driver shot to death by a California 
Highway Patrol officer during a traffic stop in 1986, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the state and the family of Yusuf Bilal, 38, met throughout the 
day Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement on the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Bruce M. Moats, a motorcycle officer, stopped Bilal's car on 
South Broadway for allegedly running a red light on March 18, 1986. They said 
Moats jabbed Bilal with a baton when Bilal was slow to get out of the car as 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Attack 
</P>
<P>
Moats, 38, said he fired his gun after Bilal wrested away the baton and 
threatened to attack him. The officer said he acted in self-defense, fearing 
for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Bilal's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court 
seeking damages "in the millions." While the terms of the proposal that would 
settle the lawsuit were not disclosed, sources close to the case said the state 
offered at least "seven figures." The settlement offer was made Friday. Trial 
of the lawsuit had been scheduled to start Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unjust the way Yusuf was murdered," Robert Johnson, 39, Bilal's brother, 
told reporters Tuesday outside the downtown court office where attorneys for 
the family and the state were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother was just trying to defend himself," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was joined in the Courthouse hallway by Bilal's wife, Naseem, daughter, 
Nazihah, 2, and sons Abdullah, 6, and Adur Raham, 3. Citing insufficient 
evidence to prove that a crime occurred, the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office declined to prosecute Moats for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-page report by Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard B. Healey concluded in August, 
1986, that when Moats shot Bilal, he did so in the belief that he was in 
serious danger. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the decision not to file a complaint, Healey said he and other 
investigators were "not happy" with the tactics Moats used when he stopped 
Bilal's car about 2 p.m. March 18, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's report said that after ordering Bilal several times to 
step out of the car, Moats pulled out his baton, opened the front door on the 
driver's side and jabbed Bilal to reinforce his orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly what happened next is the subject of much dispute," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struggle Ensued 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, nine witnesses heard shouts of anger and saw the 
ensuing struggle, but "the stories told . . . are often at odds with each other 
on points of critical importance." 
</P>
<P>
After sorting through these contradictions, the investigators finally concluded 
that "Moats and Bilal struggled for possession of the baton . . . Moats lost 
the baton . . . (and Moats) fired three shots at Bilal, hitting him in the 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers arriving moments after the shooting said they found 
Bilal sprawled on his back outside the car with his right leg extending through 
the open driver's door. They said they found the baton on the floor in front of 
the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the jabbing with the baton "might have been 'unreasonable' in 
the sense that it was demeaning and inflammatory and much likelier to excite 
further resistance than it was to extinguish resistance."

WYCHE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR ALL HIS EFFORT, HE IS STILL KNOWN AS WICKY WACKY

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was once a Cal center named Roy Riegels who ran in the correct direction 
10,000 times on the football field, but did anyone call him Right Way Riegels? 
</P>
<P>
No-o-o. 
</P>
<P>
But let him take one wrong turn, as he did after picking up a Georgia Tech 
fumble in the 1929 Rose Bowl, and he was Wrong Way Riegels forever. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a coach named Sam Wyche . . . 
</P>
<P>
He's 44 years old, in his fifth season, has just put together the league's No. 
1 offense and guided the Bengals to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone call him innovative? 
</P>
<P>
Bold? 
</P>
<P>
Dynamic? 
</P>
<P>
Try Wicky Wacky. 
</P>
<P>
A Pittsburgh Steelers assistant hung that on him last season when Wyche botched 
the end of their game. This was shortly after Sam's pratfall de resistance, 
against the San Francisco 49ers, replays of which are being shown every hour on 
the hour this week. If Custer had survived the Little Bighorn, he wouldn't have 
been asked about it any more than has Wyche about this. 
</P>
<P>
Do they call Wyche warm? 
</P>
<P>
Caring? 
</P>
<P>
Down to earth? 
</P>
<P>
Many do, since 99% of the time, he's as nice as you please and has a heart that 
is clearly in the right place. This is the man who drives around the empty 
streets early Sunday mornings before games, notices the people sleeping in the 
doorways, and volunteers to speak during the off-season for $5,000 a pop so he 
can donate the money to aid the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are those nights when the moon is full and he grows fangs 
and turns into a werewolf. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a warrant out for his arrest in New Orleans, where he slammed the 
locker-room door on the hand of a deputy sheriff who was trying to serve papers 
on a Bengal player in 1985. Wyche missed both the Super Bowl and the scouting 
combine workout that season, because the law in New Orleans would have picked 
him up the moment he set his first tiger paw down at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after a close loss at Denver, he threw a 5-alarm tantrum in the 
postgame press conference. He kicked the door on the way in, ordered reporters 
to wipe those smiles off their faces and ask their questions. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic reporter, working weekends for National Public Radio, asked why Wyche 
had kicked the door. Wyche ordered that the man be removed, leaped off the 
podium, grabbed his microphone, tore the sponge cover off it and threw it in 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche later apologized for this one and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he had those losses to the Steelers and 49ers to explain, and a 4-11 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, we can't put this man up for canonization yet. He's lucky he's 
still working. 
</P>
<P>
Working he is, however, and quite well. 
</P>
<P>
He has a team in the championship game and is known around the league as a 
bright guy with a fine football mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If Sam has a problem, it's that he's too much of a human being," says Boomer 
Esiason, who knows all about Sam's problems, having been one for their first 
few years together. 
</P>
<P>
"He cares too much. An NFL coach has got to walk around like a block of 
granite, not caring about anything. I mean, if I had a problem, I wish that 
were my problem." 
</P>
<P>
And inventive? 
</P>
<P>
Says Esiason: "He's brought a lot of things to this game. Our audibling system 
is incredible. Our language is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams would say, '84-Z-in.' We never say that. We go, 
'Split-Painter-Denver-Zebra-Dover.' What the hell is that? 
</P>
<P>
"It took me 2 years to learn the damn language. I'm yelling out there, 'Ralph!' 
and 'Lou!' and 'Lester!' and 'Denver!' and 'Dallas!' and the Bills (the 
Bengals' opponent in the conference final) are saying, 'They're coming this 
way! No, that way! No, they're coming at me!' 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what the hell we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
"Sam's always thinking. He's thinking about our offensive schemes. Or he's 
scheming about the way our offense thinks, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boomer Esiason 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to understand about Wyche, he's an overachiever. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Bubba, was a star quarterback at Tennessee. Sam was a plugger who 
had to walk on at Furman. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Sam who gutted it out in the Continental League, got a tryout with 
the newly formed Bengals and impressed enough coaches with his want-to to last 
9 pro seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very good," he says. "I didn't have a very strong arm. I was the guy 
who stayed after practice because I needed it. I knew the game plans cold 
because I knew if I had to rely on sheer ability, I was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"But it didn't take anybody very long to figure out I couldn't hit a quick 
'out' to the left and they'd trade me somewhere else. I played for 5 teams in 
the space of 9 years." 
</P>
<P>
The next thing to understand is that Wyche is smart. 
</P>
<P>
And the next, that he was groomed as a Bengal quarterback, and as a 49er 
assistant coach, by Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Genius may be excessive language for a man with flair for X's and O's, even one 
who could get 300 yards of passing offense out of a Scout troop, but whatever 
you want to call Walsh, he's among the game's most astute men and has proved it 
several times over. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh isn't at all offended at being called a genius, however. Raider Coach Tom 
Flores, asked at the '84 Super Bowl if he was a genius, too, answered, 
becomingly, that Einstein was a genius. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, asked the same question the year before, started his answer this way: 
"Some people have said that. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And Walsh raised Wyche from a puppy. 
</P>
<P>
So what we have here is a hard-driving young man with a genius-designate for a 
mentor who likes the challenge of living by his wits and isn't bashful. 
</P>
<P>
Can Sam think, or what? 
</P>
<P>
Even his quotes are masterpieces of invention: 
</P>
<P>
Did Seattle have Joe Nash feign injury -- "The big Nash attack," Sam dubbed it 
-- to stalemate his no-huddle offense? 
</P>
<P>
Sam's protests included one from the often overlooked medical-ethical 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"The Seattle doctors came out on the field," Wyche said. "Either the doctors 
were duped by all this, or they were involved in the sham. There is a medical 
code of ethics, you know, and I'm sure the Seattle association of physicians, 
or whatever the group is, would check into it." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the King County (Wash.) Medical Society has announced no action. 
</P>
<P>
Did the league stop the Bengals from going on a quick count in their no-huddle 
offense against the Bills? 
</P>
<P>
Sam came up with a jurisprudential angle. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports sometimes teaches the world a lesson," he said. "I think in these days 
of overcrowding of jails, this is probably an answer. The next time somebody 
robs a restaurant at 6:30 in the evening, the police should let the crook go 
and tell the restaurant, 'You can't stay open until 6:30 because you're 
vulnerable to being robbed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Did Buffalo Coach Marv Levy suggest that the Bengals have enough talent to 
dispense with the Mickey Mouse stuff and just line up and play? 
</P>
<P>
"That's another disappointment from Marv Levy," Wyche said. "I've always 
thought so much of him. It's kinda like finding out about Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche can coach, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengal offense isn't exactly talent-shy, but his contribution counts, too, 
and he's had it at the top of the league ratings for years. 
</P>
<P>
He could have run double reverses to his heart's content, and picked off the 
occasional media straggler, too, without ever calling down public scorn upon 
himself, but for one feverish moment, late in the afternoon of Sunday, Sept. 
20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals, who had gone 10-6 the year before and missed the playoffs by a 
tiebreaker, were 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers and Sam's old mentor, Walsh, were in town. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals led, 26-20, with 6 seconds left, with fourth and long at their 
30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
You're the coach, what's the call? 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone out there say anything but "Punt!"? 
</P>
<P>
Wyche ran halfback James Brooks on a sweep, trying to eat up the remaining 
time, but the 49ers threw him for a 5-yard loss. The clock stopped at :02. The 
49er offense came out and Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to Jerry Rice, 
tying the game, 26-26. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche, clearly in never-never land, then crossed the field to shake Walsh's 
hand -- before Ray Wersching kicked the extra point that won the game. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Wyche won't concede it was a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
So how does he remember it? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we lost a close game," he says. "They were a top team. We played 'em 
right to the end of the game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy at the end of the game was correct. It will be the strategy that 
we'd employ again." 
</P>
<P>
Not unless he wants Paul Brown to come down from the owner's box and choke him, 
it won't be. 
</P>
<P>
The august and rarely-heard-from Brown, himself, later alluded to unspecified 
big mistakes in that game. 
</P>
<P>
The players reportedly weren't too supportive either. 
</P>
<P>
"There were players literally going after him after that game," says Tom 
Dinkel, a former Bengal linebacker who covers the team for a Cincinnati radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the players got vocal with Sam. There were players on defense who 
wanted part of him." 
</P>
<P>
However, there's a sanitizing process at work, too. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh called Wyche the next day and told him it was the right call, that they 
had put their fastest runners on the punt-block team and would have blocked any 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Trumpy, the NBC sports anchor in Cincinnati and a Wyche stalwart, says, "I 
still don't know what Sam did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Trumpy says the problem was that the Bengal fullback didn't block the 49er end, 
resulting in the loss. Of course, a player missing an assignment is part of the 
risk of running any play. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Wyche was soon going to have more to answer for. 
</P>
<P>
Five weeks later, with the regulars just back from their strike and the Bengals 
at 2-3, they picked up the season at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals trailed, 23-20, but reached the Steeler 18, with 15 seconds left 
and no timeouts. Esiason started to line the offense up so he could spike the 
ball behind center for an incomplete pass and stop the clock, a tactic that had 
just been legalized, when Wyche sent the field goal unit on. It couldn't get 
lined up in time and the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
On an elevator down to the locker room, Pittsburgh assistant coach Dick Hoak 
told a couple of writers: 
</P>
<P>
"Wicky Wacky messed up another one." 
</P>
<P>
A nickname was born. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals lost 8 of their last 10 games and Wyche's firing was expected 
imminently. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood around at a lot of practices with Mike Brown (Paul's son, the general 
manager)," Dinkel says. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's not one to cuss so he can sound like one of the boys, but he was saying 
things like, 'I don't believe what the . . . is going on out there. . . . No . 
. . organization.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mike was totally fed up with the deal." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the season, the coaches and writers waited all morning to see 
what action would be taken. At noon, Wyche and the coaches left, saying they 
were going to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Who's buying, yelled a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim McNally," Wyche replied. "He's the only one with a guaranteed contract." 
</P>
<P>
Actually Wyche was forgetting someone. He still had a guaranteed contract, with 
another year left on it. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Paul Brown called him in and told him they'd honor it, if Wyche 
agreed to some changes. 
</P>
<P>
He was to stop skipping meals, stop working all night, stop keeping the staff 
there all night. 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds a little like the famous Dan White "Twinkie defense," wherein a 
junk-food diet was argued in court to have driven a man to crime, it should 
also be noted that Wyche is a lot mellower these days. 
</P>
<P>
"Players feel comfortable around him," Dinkel says. "He's not so 
schizophrenic." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one other difference in the Bengals this season, that Brown 
doesn't mention -- and Wyche won't concede. 
</P>
<P>
Did Paul Brown tell him to cut out a lot of the tricky stuff? 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what Sam says, they've kept things so simple," Dinkel says. 
</P>
<P>
"They took out all the gadgets. If you say the word gadget to Sam, he'll blow 
up in your face. He doesn't want people to think he's controlled." 
</P>
<P>
But has he been? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
There's no keeping a good man down, though, and Wyche's mind whirls on. 
</P>
<P>
His fake punt helped beat the Bills in the conference final. His plan to have 
the Gatorade in David Fulcher's barrel replaced by confetti, whereupon he would 
turn around and douse Fulcher with the real stuff, didn't work, though. 
</P>
<P>
All Cincinnati waits expectantly -- fearfully? -- for what he might come up 
with in Sunday's think-off. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially now," Dinkel says. "I think there's going to be some serious 
gimmick plays in this game." 
</P>
<P>
To borrow the Sundance Kid's injunction to Butch Cassidy: 
</P>
<P>
Keep thinking, Sam. That's what you're good at.

WELCOME MAT MISSING AS BLUES REBUFF KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of how inviting the destination may be, there's a certain amount of 
peril built into any trip that begins with a visit to the in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
And although it would be grossly unfair to blame the Joneses of Bridgeton, Mo., 
for the Kings' 5-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues Tuesday night, nonetheless it 
was not a happy night for their son-in-law, Wayne Gretzky, and his teammates on 
the first leg of what could have been a pleasure cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky went without a point for only the fourth game this season, and the 
Kings could never catch up against a team they had dispatched with ease less 
than a week before in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues, who had gone three months without beating anybody in the Kings' 
division, the Smythe, and had only won once in their last six games, period, 
scored the only two goals of the third period to throw an immediate snag into 
the Kings' itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after Luc Robitaille launched a rolling puck off a Gretzky feed that 
tap-danced along the goal line but never crossed it, Tony Hrkac jammed home a 
rebound past King goalie Mark Fitzpatrick at 12:24 of the third period, one of 
three goals the Blues scored from point-blank range but the only one of 17 
shots to escape Fitzpatrick in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
That gave St. Louis a 4-2 lead, and Herb Raglan added an empty-net goal with 36 
seconds left to complete the night's frustration for the visitors. Even the 
normally unflappable Gretzky was seen throwing a forearm at the back of St. 
Louis' Doug Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans thought nothing of it, but teammate Gordie Roberts couldn't resist taking 
a verbal jab. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Gretzky's got to realize checkers have a job to do, too," Roberts 
said. "We're not fans. We're not going to sit and watch him do whatever he 
wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We respect what he's done. He has to respect what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Roberts allowed, maybe Gretzky doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a way of getting the last laugh," acknowledged Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
With consecutive games against three struggling teams -- the Blues, the New 
York Islanders, and the Hartford Whalers -- the Kings, who had been unbeaten in 
five games, figured to fatten up on this trip, at least until next Tuesday, 
when they visit the Washington Capitals, the first-place team in the Patrick 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they received a rude reminder that no one likes to be considered a 
soft touch -- especially in front of the home fans, in this case, 17,408 at the 
St. Louis Arena, including 18 guests of Gretzky and his wife, Janet Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to realize that every team wants to beat us," said Gretzky, who had a 
stiff back even before he picked up a St. Louis shadow, Rick Meagher. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we've played so far this season, we've had some success, we've gained 
some respect. Now there are no off-nights." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings fell behind, 2-0, on first-period goals by Peter Zezel and Gino 
Cavallini. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Duchesne got one of those back with his 16th goal at 1:57 of the second 
period, when he worked a pretty give-and-go with Igor Liba on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
But St. Louis took a two-goal advantage again when Todd Ewen slid a backhand 
pass to Tony McKegney for a short putt past Fitzpatrick at 12:24 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls made it 3-2 at 16:01 with his 46th goal of the season, when he 
snapped a shot over the shoulder of Blue goaltender Vincent Riendeau on the 
short side. The goal, in Nicholls' 46th game, kept alive the center's hope of 
joining the select few who have scored 50 goals in 50 games or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice (Rocket) Richard was the first to do it, in 1945. Gretzky has done it 
three times and Mike Bossy and Jari Kurri once each, and Mario Lemieux of 
Pittsburgh is a goal away from doing so, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great thrill to be one of five guys in the history of the game 
(to get 50 in 50)," Nicholls said. "And if you're scoring goals, you're helping 
the team. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line Tuesday, however, was that there would be no more scoring for 
the Kings. Riendeau, who made 30 saves, saw to that, with a little help on 
Robitaille's line-hugger. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the goal judge. He said it was half in and half out for sure," 
Robitaille said. "We had a lot of chances. It was just one of those nights."

<P>
The San Francisco 49ers are not so much a team as a state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling they're slightly embarrassed to find themselves involved in 
something as crass as a Super Bowl. It's like dropping in at a servants' 
wedding or showing up at the opera in brown shoes. They feel as if they're 
slumming. 
</P>
<P>
Super Bowls are for Pittsburgh Steelers, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings. 
It's for people who show up in hats with horns, or their faces painted blue, 
not for people from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are supposed to be, like, the team from Disneyland. The team mascot 
should be Tinker Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers would have to unbend a little even to be called effete. They seem to 
be looking at the world through a monocle. 
</P>
<P>
The English have a saying, "No gentleman plays a game too well," and this 
approach fits the 49er philosophy well. They keep getting into Super Bowls, 
somewhat to their chagrin, and it's kind of embarrassing. Like Harvard beating 
Penn State. Hard to explain at the club. 
</P>
<P>
For years, they were to the league what the fight game calls "an opponent." 
This was to signify a guy who was good but not too, who looked good on the 
record but could be counted on to lose with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were good at that. They played the game like tennis on Long Island. 
They got good at jumping the net and pumping the hand of the winner with "Nice 
backhand, Grizzy!" sort of bonhomie and off to dress for dinner. At a 49er 
game, the highlight of the afternoon was when the announcement would come over 
the loudspeaker as to where the postgame cocktail party was to be held. This 
was the only team that took the field with an olive. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers cared more about form than substance. If football were Olympic 
diving, they would have all been 10s. They were football's figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Bill Walsh seemed absolutely perfect as a coach for this team. No one 
ever looked better losing than Walsh. At Stanford, where they prize that sort 
of thing even more than the 49ers, Walsh fielded these dazzling losers. 
Stanford hardly ever played in a game that didn't end up 49-28, one way or the 
other. It didn't matter which to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's teams never bored you. Nobody ever fell on the ball, sat on a lead, cut 
its losses. Walsh's teams had flair. What they didn't have, usually, was the 
ball. Of course, they didn't need it much. It was said Bill Walsh could take 
the statue of Beethoven in the quadrangle and turn it into an all-league 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers figured this guy would be perfect for their cocktail-party team. The 
team had a 2-14 record when he arrived and even for San Francisco, this was 
overdoing the good loser a bit. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Walsh wasn't any better. But his first-season 2-14 had a lot of games 
lost by 24-27, 24-35, 27-28, 20-26. 
</P>
<P>
When he improved to 6-10, no one got uneasy. San Francisco could live with 
that. Walsh even looked the part. With his white hair, white sweaters and white 
shoes, he looked on the sidelines like a parish priest giving a benediction. 
</P>
<P>
Most football coaches have this grizzled, rumpled look of a guy who just left 
the pool hall or came into town off a freight. They yell a lot. Walsh never 
raises his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches drink beer from a bottle, Coke from a can. Walsh wants to know 
what year the Chardonnay is before he opens it. Most coaches watch game films. 
Walsh watches "Masterpiece Theater." Walsh may be the only coach in the league 
who knows that Puccini didn't play for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
It was a match made in heaven. San Francisco couldn't have been happier if 
Emperor Norton had come back, that dotty old character on Market Street they 
used to let think was the ruler of the city. 
</P>
<P>
And, then, Walsh began to misunderstand the whole thing. He began to field a 
team that was good on both sides of the ball. The natives were scandalized. A 
San Francisco team that blocked and tackled! Good Lord! Next, he'd be making 
noise eating soup. I mean, what did he think this was -- Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
It was a crisis of sorts. San Franciscans didn't want to call this kind of 
vulgar attention to itself. They were mortified. San Francisco, almost the most 
over-civilized city in the world, likes to think of itself as a western Paris 
or a new Athens and here it was looking more like Tuscaloosa -- a community 
noted for its football team. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were no longer a complicated ballet company, they were ruffians. 
First thing you knew, they whomped everybody, went 15-3 for the season. And 
then they won the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, they didn't know whether to give Walsh the keys to the city or a 
piece of their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers settled down then to a couple of so-so seasons. And the town was 
relieved. One was a strike year, but the other was one in which the 49ers 
managed to win some 45-35 games and lose some, 24-28. This was more like it. 
</P>
<P>
Then Walsh proceeded to misunderstand the situation again. He went 17-1 and 
trashed Miami in another Super Bowl, 38-16. San Francisco hardly dared show its 
face. Whatever would Sausalito think! 
</P>
<P>
When Walsh got bombed by the New York Giants in the 1986 playoff game, 49-3, 
the town could hold its head high again. Then, last year, after going 13-2, the 
team fell on its haircuts against Minnesota, 24-36. This was 49er heritage. 
Eccentricity San Francisco could live with. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they may run Bill Walsh out of town. He has done the unthinkable. By 
going to his third Super Bowl in this decade, he has turned San Francisco's 
eccentric hobby into the worst kind of municipal embarrassment -- a sports 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Caen will be moving to Orange County. Tony Bennett will have to get a 
whole new set of lyrics. Little cable cars, my foot. Giant linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
There is hope, of course. San Francisco could lose humiliatingly to Cincinnati 
on Super Sunday. After all, Cincinnati doesn't have little cable cars climbing 
halfway to the stars or a Golden Gate Bridge, fog or Nob Hill. No one ever 
wrote about losing his heart in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
They'd probably be overjoyed to be known as the "home of the Super Bowl 
champions." San Francisco would feel as if somebody had just called it Frisco. 
</P>
<P>
If Bill Walsh quits the 49ers after this season, you might hear about how it's 
due to his differences with the owner. Don't believe it. It'll be his 
differences with the community. 
</P>
<P>
The people of San Francisco can put up with anything but a winning streak. They 
are not going to let that team make a laughingstock of them. A town that can 
call an earthquake a fire is not going to let a bunch of roughnecks in football 
suits ruin its image all over the world.

49ER COACH IS A WALL OF KNOWLEDGE; FEW SEE HIS OTHER SIDE

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Walsh, you've just won your third Super Bowl in the 1980s, sealing your 
fate as destiny's child and one of the greatest coaches ever. 
</P>
<P>
You've won 102 games in 10 years with the San Francisco 49ers, all the while 
speaking eloquently about fine wines and wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
You dress smartly, have a mean topspin forehand and can recite the Dred Scott 
decision in three languages. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, you've done it all, and so much better than the rest. So what are 
you going to do now? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honestly, I'll probably take all this frustration out on the media. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have watched and writhed with Walsh over the years can see it coming 
-- an opportunity fatter than a roundhouse punch -- should his 49ers slip past 
the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One more victory may trigger a final sunset ride out of town for Walsh on his 
high horse, since good will have triumphed over evil in the harsh football 
world Walsh has lived and/or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, they say, is as gracious a loser as you'll ever know. And an equally 
horrible winner, like the field general once described by Winston Churchill as 
being "in defeat unbeatable, in victory unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
Never has that been more the case than in the 1988 season, in which Walsh has 
used personal setbacks and team controversies to rekindle a Super Bowl fire, 
with Walsh perhaps serving as team arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the charge, Walsh has jumped his team over a season's barriers, whether 
real and imagined. It began with his demotion as club president in March and 
continued through a quarterback controversy that he insists was invented by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It provided enough fuel to get his team over the rough spots, none knottier 
than a Nov. 13 loss to the Raiders that dropped the 49ers to 6-5 for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably had never sunk so low as after the loss to the Raiders," said Mike 
White, a former coach at California and Illinois who is probably Walsh's 
closest friend. 
</P>
<P>
Since hitting the comeback trail, though, Walsh has been relentless, lashing 
out after every obstacle is cleared on the way to Super Bowl XXIII. His recent 
news conferences have become personal and well-crafted attacks against local 
reporters, blaming them for turning the Steve Young-Joe Montana controversy 
into the straw that nearly broke a team's comeback. You wonder how a team ever 
made it this far. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had clearly defined the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"You might get that kind of feeling, that it's always Bill against the world," 
said Jim Finks, general manager of the New Orleans Saints. "He does have that 
image." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was a quarterback controversy, local reporters insist, that was created 
and fanned by Walsh himself, in a calculated effort to push an aging Montana to 
new heights. 
</P>
<P>
When it backfired, and Montana was finally reinstated as the starter after 
reluctantly sitting out 2 games, Walsh needed an alibi. So he wrapped Montana 
neatly in a cloak of illness and injury, insisting that he had been benched for 
health reasons. Montana denies to this day that he was ever injured or 
fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, though, has stayed with that story. Before a season-ending game with the 
Rams, after the 49er recovery was complete, Walsh lamented about the travails 
of Montana and how injury had been misconstrued as controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, a lot of people doing the criticism knew full well what 
the problems were," Walsh said. "They knew Joe had had major back surgery (in 
1986), that he'd lost 10 pounds and was weakened. Even in his appearance, it 
was very obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, certain people in our press made a big issue of the fact that Joe 
wasn't playing and did everything to convince people that I was confused as to 
what I was doing as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The quarterback controversy, I feel, was ill-conceived and unfair to a lot of 
people, but we've gotten through it and we're on our way." 
</P>
<P>
And so they were, though sometimes it seemed like Walsh against the world. In 
his news conference before the NFC title game against the Bears, Walsh 
valiantly defended his record, as if anyone had questioned it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be easy," said Walsh, who then listed his impressive 
accomplishments. "There's a lot positives about this football team. I'm not 
sure you want to hear it . . . 2 Super Bowls, 6 divisions . . . not bad." 
</P>
<P>
So the question is: Just who is Bill Walsh and what does he want? At 57, he 
seems ready to tie a ribbon on a brilliant coaching career. Most think he'll 
call it quits if his team wins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But for a man who has so precious little to prove, Walsh seems bent on proving 
it over and over, to whomever will listen. He has long been a mysterious nut to 
crack, followers say, mainly because he won't let you get close enough with a 
cracker. He has a few close friends but generally stays a healthy distance from 
players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, when Montana was struggling and mystified over his 
demotion, a reporter suggested that the quarterback meet with Walsh to clear 
the air. Montana said it wouldn't make any difference, not even after a 10-year 
player-coach relationship. 
</P>
<P>
White said it's not uncommon for Walsh to go months at a time without speaking 
to one of his coaches. It happened to White 10 years ago, as a 49er assistant 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, Bill has developed that style," White said. "And it's a 
natural barrier. You know, great leaders are respected but not always invited 
to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping your distance also makes it easier to administer, especially for one so 
hands-on as Walsh, who has full command of football operation. 
</P>
<P>
As a player, backup quarterback Steve Young has grown to admire Walsh's 
football genius, while walking gingerly in his coach's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't talk a lot to quarterbacks," Young said. "I think he expects 
perfection, and you know that, and he drives you to play well enough just to 
get a nod. It's like, you think you're playing pretty well, and it's like, ah, 
I think he nodded at me. I think I almost saw some reaction. I take that as 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
But if it takes fear to be motivated, Young says he doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He somehow gets you on edge," he said. "You feel you're always on edge. I get 
the feeling he's staring at me every play, you know, and I'm saying, 'OK, I'll 
do better. I promise.' I think he's driven me by whatever he's done. Or maybe 
I've just imagined it, but I keep working hard. Trying to impress him, I think, 
is the ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
So Walsh isn't a player's coach so much as a coach who makes great players. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all his successes, some insist that Walsh will ultimately leave the 
game unfulfilled, unhappy and under-appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Some contend that Walsh can hold a grudge with the best of them and may be 
doing so now. Does he still resent not landing an NFL head-coaching job until 
he was 47? He seems a paradox, a man who wraps himself in his scholarly image 
-- the connoisseur of fine wine and history -- yet is much more a football 
workaholic than he lets on. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh wrote his master's thesis on defensive football. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot more like Mike Ditka than Arthur Schlesinger," said Ira Miller, a 
Bay Area sportswriter who has covered Walsh for nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
So what does Bill Walsh want? More respect than he has? More titles? Why the 
100-pound chip on the shoulder? 
</P>
<P>
During an interview session last week in Santa Clara, Calif., Walsh was asked 
if he had fulfilled every goal in his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh sure," Walsh said. "Of course, some of you (reporters) haven't agreed every 
week. But my offense is updated. I know it's been outdated, as you've indicated 
every other week. . . . I'm kidding. It's been very good, I'm pleased, 
gratified." 
</P>
<P>
Are you sure? 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a read-between-the-lines reader to detect something missing on 
Walsh's gratitude meter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a sensitive guy," White said. "And I know there hasn't been the 
appreciation for what he's done. I've never heard him verbalize it, that it's 
the press' fault. But he's never felt the Bay Area press or the people have 
been as supportive. He's never said it to me, but he's said it in other ways." 
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Chicago for the NFC title game, Walsh remarked to friends 
how much excitement there seemed to be about the Bears in Chicago, as if that 
feeling were somehow foreign to San Franciscans. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Walsh reportedly was hurt that more attention wasn't given his 100th pro 
victory (including playoffs), recorded 3 weeks ago in the first-round playoff 
win over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh seems to absorb the hurt before channeling it into high football energy. 
Always another hurdle to climb. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing wounded Walsh more than his demotion last off-season as club president. 
The edict was handed down by owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. -- who assumed the 
duties of president -- after the 49ers, who had won Super Bowl XIX in 1984, 
were bounced out in the first round for the third consecutive season. DeBartolo 
and Walsh didn't speak for 6 weeks after the 49ers' 36-24 playoff loss to the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
The demotion stripped Walsh of his title, yes, but not his actual powers. The 
stripping of Walsh's dignity was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us realize how that Minnesota game affected him and the 
organization," White said. "We know how it affected Eddie. I don't know if it 
was the taking away of the president title that has made (Walsh) even more 
motivated than ever to prove once and for all how solid that organization was. 
When it was sliding, when he was really down, that's when he really took 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh was stung again on March 22, 1988, when a local gossip columnist hinted 
at an alleged affair between Walsh and a local model. 
</P>
<P>
"What genius coach is being put on waivers by his wife for his long-running 
relationship with a TV sports reporter who's a former Playboy centerfold?" the 
item teased. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had been separated from his wife, Geri. 
</P>
<P>
Though the story was never explored further or substantiated, some believe that 
Walsh has been taking it out on reporters ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt him a lot," White said of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh believes he deserves better, considering the riches he has brought to the 
Bay Area since his arrival in 1979. There have been no mysteries about Walsh on 
the field; no questions or quandaries. Walsh took over a team that won 2 games 
in 1978 and had only 2 losing seasons -- 2-14 and 6-10 -- before bringing a 
Super Bowl championship to San Francisco after the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
His team is the winningest in the 1980s, with only 2 losing seasons in the 
decade -- 6-10 in 1980 and 3-6 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
More remarkable to observers has been the high level of consistency, even 
through the non-Super Bowl years. Walsh enters Sunday's game with only five 
players who participated in his first Super Bowl win. Thirty players on this 
year's team weren't around in the 1984 season, when the 49ers defeated Miami in 
Super Bowl XIX. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, since the last Super Bowl trip, Walsh's teams have posted records of 10-6, 
10-5-1, and 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very hard to do," said Finks, who has built strong franchises in 
Minnesota, Chicago and now New Orleans. "It's the way the (draft) system is. 
You're penalized by success. He's done an excellent job at refueling the club. 
He's done as good a job as anyone's ever done in the business." 
</P>
<P>
And the 49ers are all Bill Walsh. He orchestrates his team's yearly player 
drafts, makes all personnel decisions and coaches a little on the side. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Walsh traded draft choices to New England for the right to move up and 
take wide receiver Jerry Rice. Not a bad pick. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Walsh took defensive end Larry Roberts in the second round, fullback 
Tom Rathman and cornerback Tim McKyer in the third, linebacker Charles Haley, 
offensive linemen Steve Wallace and Kevin Fagan in the fourth and corner Don 
Griffin in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear more from those players Sunday. In 1987, he drafted starting tackle 
Harris Barton. This year, second-round defensive picks, ends Pierce Holt and 
Danny Stubbs, have been big contributors, as has a third-round linebacker, Bill 
Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has succeeded, he says, because his owner has kept his nose out of 
Walsh's business -- with the exception of one aforementioned, 
nameplate-removing outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line of it all is that Ed DeBartolo has given me the responsibility 
of doing it," Walsh said. "A lot of organizations will stop and start pointing 
fingers at each other. They blame each other, and before long, no one will make 
a decision. No one will step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh has stepped forward. Now he wants to be counted, though he is widely 
recognized as a coach with few peers. 
</P>
<P>
"I sharpened my skills being around him, almost just by accident," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's expertise is in quickly dissecting an opponent and constructing a 
visionary game plan to exploit weaknesses. You have no doubt heard that the 
first 25 plays of a Walsh game plan are scripted in advance. 
</P>
<P>
There are complicated explanations of Walsh's gift, and one other offered by 
quarterback Young. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's going to pull anything over on Bill Walsh," he said. "There's no 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh studied in some fine finishing schools, but no time was more important 
than 8 years spent under Paul Brown with the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is more creative," White said of Walsh. "As far as 
executing a game plan on game day, there's no one I respect more. . . . I think 
he's very intelligent. I don't know what his IQ is, but all you can do is learn 
by being around him, almost by osmosis. I marvel how he uses Rice and (Roger) 
Craig, the way he utilizes what he's got." 
</P>
<P>
White says Bill Walsh is really quite a guy, if you'd only take the time to get 
to know him. Of course, some might add, who has that much time?

When Gaylord Perry missed being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, winding 
up 34 votes shy of the 336 needed for enshrinement, were you disappointed? 
</P>
<P>
Heartbroken. I thought he should have missed by 336 votes. This guy loaded so 
much junk on the baseball it floated up to the plate looking like a hot-fudge 
sundae. This is known as creativity and gamesmanship. It is also known as 
cheating. 
</P>
<P>
Enshrinement? How about incarceration? Your momma could win 300 games with 
Perry's bag o' tricks. 
</P>
<P>
You're not supposed to be able to drool your way into the Hall of Fame. Perry 
deserves his own special niche, though. Bestow on him the title Sultan of 
Saliva, present him with a gold-plated tube of K-Y Jelly (hold the peanut 
butter) and give him an Academy Award for special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the news on the Southern Methodist football scene? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A return to life, a renewed pride for the Mustangs' program, which was found 
guilty of every rule infraction but loading up the football with K-Y Jelly. 
Around Dallas there is a proliferation of bumper stickers bragging: "SMU 
football: Integrity since 1989." 
</P>
<P>
That's old news, though, since those bumper stickers started appearing a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent halftime interview, Pat Riley told Chick Hearn, "There's been a 
lot of speculation, undue criticism directed at Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) about his 
performance." Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
I think what Riley meant to say was "overdue," in which case I agree. 
</P>
<P>
If the criticism was undue, it's curious that Riley would put Kareem on a 
2-week probation. What did Riley tell Kareem? "If this town's sportswriters 
don't shape up soon, you'll be benched."? 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, most of the undue criticism of Kareem has come from Kareem. 
</P>
<P>
The media criticism, Riley said, "created a burden on our club." Solving the 
Lakers' problems should be simple, then. Just cancel the players' -- and 
coach's -- newspaper subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think of the book, "Personal Foul: The Broken Promises and 
Shattered Dreams of Big Money Basketball at Jim Valvano's North Carolina 
State"? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riveting. I couldn't put it down. I read the entire title in one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 I read where Lloyd Moseby is disappointed because he's about to be traded by 
the Toronto Blue Jays, just when they're about to get new uniforms and move to 
a new ballpark. He said, "For 9 years I've played in pajamas, in the worst 
ballpark in baseball." Do you sympathize? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does a bear install plumbing in the woods? You think I'm called Mr. Negative 
because I hang out in photo darkrooms? 
</P>
<P>
I think Mr. Moseby should be re-assigned to a new occupation featuring 
dignified clothing and pleasant working conditions. Coal mining comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, though, I guess it wouldn't be much fun to be in a line of work 
where you're forced to wear a silly cap, funny underwear and flip-down 
sunglasses. No wonder the players are threatening to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Bob Trumpy made an on-the-air reference to Miami football Coach Jimmy 
Johnson having a reputation as "a used-car salesman." Was that a low blow? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The lowest, an unprovoked cheap shot at used-car salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Most used-car salesmen, in fact, are former college coaches and alumni athletic 
boosters who had conscience attacks and decided to go straight, but couldn't do 
it cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Do you personally refer to the Forum as the Great Western Forum? After all, 
Great Western Bank did kick in a lot of money for arena improvements in 
exchange for linking its name with that of the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I think it would be unfair to single out one sponsor to have its name attached 
to this great arena. Several other corporations generously donate money to the 
Forum in exchange for hanging their name or logo inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, I always refer to this grand arena by its full and proper name: The 
Toyota Kenwood Prime Ticket Budweiser Michelin RC Cola Continental Airlines 
Sharp Copiers Centinela Hospital KLSX Radio Labatt's Blue Discount Tire Center 
Bud Light Northwest Airlines Gatorade Amtrak Lite Beer From Miller Canon EOS

MIKE DOWNEY: RAVELING TAKES A STAND BESIDE THOMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling is every bit as appalled by this Proposal 42 business as his 
friend and colleague, John Thompson. Yet, even if the USC basketball coach 
disagreed strongly with the Georgetown coach on how much harm this new edict 
might do to their sport, to their profession and to the young people who 
populate it, he still would acknowledge the guts it took to walk off the job in 
protest, the way Thompson did the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think there are a lot of John Thompsons out there," Raveling said 
Tuesday. "Whether you agree with the man or disagree, he's willing to stand up 
to the criticism that comes his way as well as the platitudes that come his 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"In a society that tends to straddle the fence on important issues, it's 
refreshing to have someone do what John did, and it's even more admirable that 
his school has the kind of administrators who would be this supportive of a 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
They are simpatico. Raveling was the right-hand man to Thompson with the U.S. 
Olympic basketball team, just as he was to Bob Knight in 1984. Raveling and 
Thompson think many of the same thoughts. They do not think alike on 
everything, but they do agree on Proposal 42. They agree that it stinks. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling will not be walking off the Sports Arena floor before any games, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I think for another black coach, or rather minority coach, to do some sort 
of similar protest at this point would give it something of a circus 
atmosphere," Raveling said. "People might lose focus on the real issue here." 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is an amendment to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s 
original Proposition 48, passed at the organization's recent convention, 
denying scholarships to students who do not meet NCAA criteria -- a 2.0 
grade-point average in a core curriculum and a score of 700 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test or 15 on the American College Test -- tests that Raveling, for 
one, considers "culturally biased." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, insisting that Proposition 48 and Proposal 42 discriminate against 
lower-income students who cannot control the quality of their high school 
educations, left the premises before last Saturday's game between Georgetown 
and Boston College, as a dramatic gesture to indicate his opposition to the new 
rule. As of Tuesday, Thompson had not yet determined when he would return to 
the sidelines, although he continued to conduct Georgetown's practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of us feel very strongly about 42, every bit as strongly as John 
does," Raveling said. "I've been adamantly opposed to Prop. 48 from its 
inception, and I continue to be suspicious of anybody who comes to us as though 
they're being helpful and then sets down laws that we have to pass a 
standardized test for success. Standardizing is just another means of keeping 
us in our place." 
</P>
<P>
Proposal 42 was rejected on Jan. 10, then passed in a new vote the next day. 
Margin of victory: 163 to 154. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much of mandate," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
The USC coach is disgusted that the NCAA is trying to take a societal problem 
and turn it into an intercollegiate problem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic example of blaming a bad situation on the victims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something that might startle you. In 1984, the NCAA 
commissioned a study that revealed that had Prop. 48 existed back in 1977, 70% 
of the black athletes who by 1983 had graduated or were still in college 
studying would never have been admitted into the college in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling understands that some of those who supported Proposition 48 and 
Proposal 42 had their hearts in the right place. Others had other motives. Some 
just didn't like the idea of larger universities loading up on high-quality, 
low-qualifying athletes. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years now, Raveling has been proposing other solutions. He continues to 
push for the elimination of freshman eligibility. Have students enroll and make 
them spend a game-free year amassing a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or 
greater, he says. Then give them 5 years to fulfill all their college 
commitments, from curricular to extracurricular. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than forbidding him admission, give a kid the opportunity to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"People stand up full of righteous indignation to tell us that they're helping, 
but it's a joke," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
"The penalty for not meeting the requirements of Prop. 48 or (Proposal) 42 is 
greater than the penalty if an athlete tests positive for a drug, or accepts 
illegal inducements. Think about it. A kid can keep the car and money these 
days as long as he tells who gave it to him. (As with recent NCAA immunity 
rulings.) And a kid who flunks a drug test might have to sit out a year, might 
have to pay his own way. Whereas a Proposal 42 kid isn't allowed into school 
(on scholarship), just because his education's been lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"And furthermore, as (Louisiana State Coach) Dale Brown says, they also put the 
mark of Cain on him. The kid has to carry around a 'too dumb' stigma from that 
day on. See what I mean about blaming the victim?" 
</P>
<P>
Some will detect racist overtones here, maybe even on both sides. Raveling is 
not unaware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"John Thompson was very smart in getting out of saying (Proposal 42) was 
racist. The minute that word pops out, people start running around defending 
themselves, saying how their friends are black, saying how their daughter's 
friends are black. Then, once again, you lose sight of the real issue here. 
</P>
<P>
"It took courage to do what John did. Martin Luther King said if a man hasn't 
found something in his life to stand up and fight for, maybe he's not fit to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been anything that has transpired in collegiate 
athletics that I have found as distasteful as this," Raveling said. "We're 
tired of people hurting us by trying to help us. No more tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, if they want to give us a test on history, we'll score 700 
on it. History we know. History tells us that every time somebody tells us 
they're doing us a favor, our plight worsens."

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Morgan scored the final 7 points of overtime Tuesday night to carry 
Virginia to a 64-58 Atlantic Coast Conference victory over Maryland at College 
Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (6-10 overall, 0-4 in the ACC) had a 58-57 lead when Morgan, who 
scored 21 points, sank a 3-point shot with 1:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan scored again with 17 seconds left and added 2 free throws with 3 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Blundin and John Crotty each scored 11 points for Virginia (9-6, 2-2). 
Tony Massenburg had 20 points for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 73, Boston College 64 -- Bobby Martin scored 17 points and Jason

LEVINGSTON HELPS HAWKS BEAT BUCKS, 111-98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlanta Hawks have had their troubles trying to blend some new talent into 
a championship team. It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kevin Willis was injured in training camp and hasn't played a minute. 
</P>
<P>
While newcomers Moses Malone and Reggie Theus have had some problems adjusting 
to Dominique Wilkins, it was easy to replace Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Levingston, who spent his first 6 National Basketball Assn. seasons 
coming off the bench, has blended in as the substitute for the 7-foot power 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
Right from the start, Levingston has had the Hawks' best shooting percentage 
and has been a strong rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston was 10 for 12 from the field Tuesday night at Atlanta as the Hawks 
put an end to Milwaukee's 6-game winning streak with a 111-98 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston helped the Hawks build a 19-point lead in the third quarter. He was 
on the bench when Ricky Pierce came off the bench to lead a rally by the Bucks 
that cut the lead to 4 points with more than 2 1/2 minutes left. Pierce had 14 
of his 22 points in the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was Glenn Rivers, starting in place of injured Jeff Malone, who killed the 
Bucks' rally. With 2:13 left and the shot clock running down, Rivers sank a 
3-point basket to increase the lead to 99-92. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big shot," Rivers said after taking the pass from Wilkins. I saw it 
coming. When I got the pass, I knew I had to shoot it. I also knew that if it 
went in, it was all over. I like pressure situations." 
</P>
<P>
The win was only the Hawks' third in their last 8 games. It was the Bucks' 
second loss in 12 games, both to the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Levingston scored 8 of his 23 points in the second quarter when the Hawks 
outscored the Bucks, 32-16, to build what appeared to be a comfortable lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It has really helped me to know that I will play at least 30 minutes," 
Levingston said. "It's a good feeling to know you can make a mistake or two and 
not come out. We need Kevin, but it has been a big break for me." 
</P>
<P>
For one of the few times in his career, Moses Malone was not in the starting 
lineup. No, Malone was not ill or ailing. No, the 6-11 center wasn't being 
disciplined. Just before the opening tipoff, there was a call from nature and 
Moses answered it. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Koncak drew a rare last-minute start at center. Malone played 35 minutes, 
had 17 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 103, Indiana 96 -- The Bulls have had to depend on Michael Jordan, 
nearly exclusively, almost every time they have been in tough games. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was refreshing for Jordan, as well as his teammates, when the star guard 
turned playmaker and ball stealer in this victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored only 22 points but had 13 assists. John Paxson led the Bulls in 
scoring with 24 points. Jordan scored half his points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun just contributing," Jordan said after getting 6 rebounds 
and 4 steals. "I don't think I just stood around, but it was my job to get a 
couple of the other guys active. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to give the Pacers credit for the way they held me off for 3 quarters. 
I kind of paced myself tonight, because I did not get a rest until the last 3 
minutes of the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers' comeback effort had a blow when Chuck Person was hit with his 
second technical foul with 6:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Person, who scored 29 points, was given a technical in the opening minutes, so 
when he became involved in a shoving match with Chicago's Scottie Pippen, the 
second technical resulted in an automatic ejection. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Coach Dick Versace was upset with referee Ed Rush for making the second 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little double push," he said. "It happens all the time. If it had 
been Michael Jordan and he had a technical already, it wouldn't have been 
called." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 123, Houston 109 -- Harold Pressley scored 7 of his game-high 24 
points in the last 5 minutes at Sacramento to keep the Kings in command. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, in a surprisingly easy victory, led several times by 23 points in 
the victory over the Midwest Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 111, Portland 110 -- John Stockton sank 4 free throws in the last 14 
seconds at Portland to wrap up a brilliant performance. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton had 20 points, 11 in the last quarter, and 18 assists as the Jazz 
handed the Trail Blazers just their second home loss in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton's free throws came after Jerome Kersey of the Blazers missed a layup 
with 22 seconds left and Utah leading, 107-106. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler, averaging 27.9 points per game for Portland, was held to 19. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 117, San Antonio 112 -- Mike McGee came off the bench to score 24 
points at East Rutherford, N.J., and the Nets handed the Spurs their sixth 
defeat in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets built a 19-point lead in the first half, but the Spurs wiped it out 
and took a 2-point lead with 4:11 to go. Lester Conner scored twice and Joe 
Barry Carroll once to restore the Nets' control. DAN HAFNER

WHEN FISHING COOLS OFF AT CABO SAN LUCAS, BOATS MOVE FARTHER SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cold that gripped the Southland in recent weeks has also affected the 
fishing off Cabo San Lucas, but farther south the fishing is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
John (J.D.) Doughty of Bisbee's Tackle in Newport Beach, who regularly monitors 
Mexican fishing conditions, said that off the mainland coast of Manzanillo, 
"They're experiencing some of the best big-game fishing ever." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Tex, a private yacht owned by Ron Cox of Century City, reported 
catching a 350-pound blue marlin -- and losing 7 others -- 2 sailfish, a 
striped marlin and a 75-pound wahoo. In the same area last Sunday, the Blowout, 
a private sportfisher skippered by Richard Brown, reported 3 blue marlin, all 
released, a sailfish, a striped marlin, a dorado and a wahoo. On Monday, the 
Crazy Horse reported catching a 350-pound blue marlin. 
</P>
<P>
One private yacht fishing even farther south, off the coast of Zihuatanejo, 
reported catching a 450-pound blue marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the boats, however, have been fishing an area 10 to 15 miles from 
Campos Point off the coast of Manzanillo. 
</P>
<P>
"The water temperature has dropped at (Cabo San Lucas) and the bigger billfish 
have moved south to the mainland," Doughty said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cabo San Lucas, meanwhile, fishing has improved somewhat this week. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some cold weather, and the water temperature has dropped to the low 
70s," Doughty said. "Fishing was slow for the last 2 weeks, but starting Sunday 
it has shown some improvement. . . . The clarity is improving and the water 
seems to be warming up a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin, Doughty says, have become increasingly active on the Pacific 
side of the cape, with one to four opportunities per boat per day. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of congestion, though," he said. "You get three or four Mexican 
boats, what we call the Spanish Armada, and the American boats converging on 
the feeders to cast a live mackerel (in an attempt to bait the fish)." 
</P>
<P>
Doughty said the congestion is caused by fishermen having to spot the fish and 
trying to get to it before the other boats can because the marlin aren't 
hitting trolled lures. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Howarth of Newport Beach, fishing Monday off the back side of Santa 
Catalina Island, caught a 59.9-pound yellowtail. If it is approved by the 
International Game Fish Assn., it will shatter the world record. 
</P>
<P>
Howarth was reportedly using 12-pound test, bouncing a jig off the bottom at 
125 feet when the yellowtail struck. The fish came close to spooling Howarth 
twice, but after 18 minutes he had successfully landed the hearty jack and is 
expected to submit his catch to the IGFA. 
</P>
<P>
He was unavailable for comment, but the Balboa Angling Club's Helen Smith, who 
weighed the fish, said: "I've never seen a (yellowtail) that big. It was one of 
the old home guards that didn't want to get caught." 
</P>
<P>
The record yellowtail taken on 12-pound test is a 33-pound 14-ounce fish caught 
off Baja California's Coronado Islands in 1983. The all-tackle record is a 
78-pounder caught farther south at the Alijos Rocks. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's long-range fishing fleet, which filtered south to Mexico's 
Revillagigedo Islands just after Christmas, has returned from the first of many 
scheduled multiday trips in quest of giant yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
The waters around such islands as San Benedicto and Clarion have been known to 
produce the powerful tuna well in excess of 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, such fish apparently have yet to cooperate with fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"The Royal Polaris just returned and fishing wasn't that good," owner Frank 
LoPreste said. "In fact it was pretty poor. Things didn't look good at the 
Revillagigedo Islands so the boat went to Clipperton (an island 500 miles 
farther south), so they only got in 3 or 4 days of fishing." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine fishermen caught 151 yellowfin tuna -- the biggest a 274-pounder, 
but most in the 125-pound range -- 140 wahoo, 19 groupers, 8 rainbow runners 
and a black sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The American Angler returned from the Revillagigedos last week with 18 anglers 
having caught 137 yellowfin -- the largest weighing 238 pounds -- 251 wahoo, 95 
pargo, 18 groupers and 6 rainbow runners. 
</P>
<P>
The world record yellowfin, caught at San Benedicto Island in 1977, weighed 388 
pounds 12 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
A din of yelping and howling and barking and whining crackles on the 
sub-freezing air. The Truckee Lions Sierra Sweepstakes Sled Dog Races are about 
to start. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't hear this much canine cacophony if somebody turned an alley cat 
loose at a dog show. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't you protest being removed from a warm kennel and forced to drag a sled 
around in the snow? 
</P>
<P>
"They do it because they want to," insists one of the competitors, Jerry 
Jacobson, a breeder from Malad City, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, they do. 
</P>
<P>
"They love to do it more than I do," Jacobson says. 
</P>
<P>
Right, like a trip to the vet. 
</P>
<P>
"When those dogs go to the line, it takes strong men to hold 'em back," 
Jacobson says. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs do seem genuinely excited. They strain at their harnesses. Several try 
to lunge forward, frustrated. A few leap in place, all four paws off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Force them to run? Just try to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
Once the handlers start hitching them up, the dogs are in a fast-break mode. By 
the time they get near the starting line, they're ready to explode like drag 
racers. When the handlers let go and the driver, or musher, releases the brake, 
snow flies, and they're off at 15 to 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
That's why they call them sled dog races, not dogsled races. The dogs are doing 
the racing. The sleds just give the mushers -- who ride with their feet on two 
thin runners extending out behind the sleds -- something to hang on to. 
</P>
<P>
The races are for 3-, 6- and 8-dog classes over courses measuring 3.4, 6 and 
8.5 miles, respectively. As the teams leave the line at 1-minute intervals, 
announcer Don Casler follows their progress around the Truckee-Tahoe Airport 
course with radio reports from observers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a team dragging its driver," Casler reports. 
</P>
<P>
Then: "Team No. 80 is running without a driver." 
</P>
<P>
It can happen even to experienced mushers. 
</P>
<P>
Lin Neumann of La Pine, Ore., who won the 6-dog class, says: "If the dogs lose 
their footing and the sled stops, you can lose your balance and fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Or, a driver might go through what happened last weekend to Jean Russell of 
Fairfield, Calif., who has been racing sled dogs for 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going really fast until the lead dogs hit some soft snow and stopped," 
Russell said. "The wheel (rear) dogs piled up on top of the swing (middle) 
dogs. It was a terrible tangle. I set the snow hook and went out to start 
undoing the mess, and before I knew it, one of the dogs got loose and shot away 
out into the powdery snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling, 'Magic, come back here!' She's out there taking a little squat 
and looking at the team. Meanwhile, another team was going by me and I thought, 
'Oh, no, Magic is gonna follow that other team.' 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, she had a little sense and came back. I hooked her up. Then I had 
to straighten out Scooter, and by that time, Rex and Ollie were still a mess. I 
lost about 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Meyer, a general contractor from Sebastopol, Calif., who won the 8-dog 
class, recalls a musher's nightmare: when a team is so eager to run that it 
bolts and leaves him behind. What saved him that day was his lead dog, a 
Siberian husky named Saboka, which means dog in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the last times he ever ran on my team, he was running lead with another 
dog when we got a tangle and stopped near a course checker," Meyer says. "I 
asked her to hold the sled for me while I untangled the dog. When I got him 
untangled, the dogs knew they were ready to go and they bolted. She got scared 
and let go of the sled. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran off down the trail without me. If there's nobody on the sled, it's 
easier for 'em to run. They don't care if you're there or not. I chased 'em as 
long as I could in deep snow with boots on, then walked for a long time after 
that. Then I looked up and Saboka had turned the team around and come back to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell from the marks on his neck from his collar that he'd been 
choking, he'd been pulling the team around so hard. They didn't want to turn 
around. I wouldn't have believed it." 
</P>
<P>
The Truckee Lions Club has been staging the races for charity since 1979, when 
it revived a tradition of the town's 19th-Century mining days. 
</P>
<P>
Jack London is said to have watched a race down the main street in 1915, and 
Clark Gable played a musher when London's classic "The Call of the Wild" was 
filmed there in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Ed McMills, a retired San Francisco motorcycle patrolman, serves as publicist 
and alternate announcer. The Lions work hard on the event -- McMills was just 
chosen Truckee's citizen of the year -- but some years their work has been 
wasted by poor snow conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't call it annual anymore because we've had so many cancellations," 
McMills said. 
</P>
<P>
To make up for losses, a second '89 event is scheduled at Truckee for Feb. 
18-19 on President's Day weekend. The Lions will settle for last weekend's 
conditions, which were perfect: plenty of packed snow on the ground, no wind 
and cold temperatures -- 26 degrees Saturday, 10 degrees Sunday -- to keep the 
course crisp. 
</P>
<P>
When it runs, the event is part of the International Sled Dog Racing Assn.'s 
schedule of sanctioned events in Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire, Canada and 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't pay much. Of the $5,000 total Truckee purse donated by local 
merchants, Meyer won $750, Neumann $475 and Kim Burrows, a veterinary 
technician from Lewiston, Ida., $150 for winning the 3-dog class. Gary 
Slattengren of Loyalton, Calif. won $300 in the 6-dog, 8.5-mile freight race 
for loaded sleds. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably pay for our gas," Burrows said. 
</P>
<P>
The 67 entries in 4 classes came from all over the West, including Alaska, and 
money doesn't seem to be the primary motivator, least of all for the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
McMills says over the public-address system: "I think you'll feel the spirit of 
'The Call of the Wild' here today." 
</P>
<P>
The dogs are certainly up for it. 
</P>
<P>
Neumann says, "You can't beat a dog to work. You can't beat a dog to obedience. 
You can't beat a dog to run. You can't beat a dog to weight-pull. They have to 
want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"When we train, they run until we get the tongues hanging out, so they're 
working hard, pushing themselves. But we also want to make sure that tail's 
wagging." 
</P>
<P>
After a race, Neumann steps off the sled and goes down the line of dogs, 
petting and praising each one individually. 
</P>
<P>
"See?" she says. "Look at their tails. They're all wagging." 
</P>
<P>
Neumann tells how in 1987 she acquired her weight-pulling dog, a little 
black-and-white border collie, when it was brought into the clinic where she 
worked as a veterinary assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name was Trouble -- literally," Neumann says. "The owners couldn't do 
anything with her and brought her in to be euthanized. That was the first time 
I'd taken a dog home to save her." 
</P>
<P>
Neumann renamed the delinquent dog Lucky Patty and trained her for 
weight-pulling competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had her in 6 competitions. Her first competition, she placed second. The 
others she's placed first, and at 32 pounds at Portland in November, she pulled 
1,000 pounds on wheels, indoors on carpet." 
</P>
<P>
Today Lucky Patty is as sweet and well-behaved a dog as any family could want. 
</P>
<P>
The trick? 
</P>
<P>
"We gave her something to do," Neumann said. "She needed direction. She needed 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
Weight-pulling consists of dragging a sled loaded with graduating weights. Even 
a trained dog will balk if the load seems too great -- it will just sit down, 
as a couple did here, despite their handlers' coaxing. 
</P>
<P>
But Patty, lunging with all of her 32 1/2 pounds, moves 650 pounds the required 
16 feet, and Neumann scoops her up in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to do well for me," Neumann says. "She gives me everything she's 
got. She'll pull until it's physically impossible for her to pull. She will not 
quit. They get the idea: If I pull this and come to the handler, I'll get a 
treat, I'll get praise. All dogs want praise." 
</P>
<P>
First-time spectators at the races generally are surprised on two counts: The 
dogs are smaller than expected and come in several breeds and cross-breeds. 
</P>
<P>
The racers are lean, averaging about 50 pounds. There are some purebred Irish 
setters, even a few Dalmatians and perhaps a greyhound, but most common are the 
Alaskan huskies derived from those and other breeds, with Arctic breeds as a 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"Alaskan huskies are kind of hard to define," Meyer said. "They might have a 
little bit of greyhound or Irish setter in there to get the speed up. The 
toughness comes from the Alaskan dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone runs purebred Siberians, malamutes or Samoyeds -- the 
traditional-looking sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the drivers are women, which is consistent with the results of the 
world's most famous sled dog race, the 1,049-mile Iditarod from Anchorage to 
Nome, Alaska, in March. Women have won the last 4 -- Libby Riddles in '85 and 
Susan Butcher 3 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Neumann was asked how women can compete with men in sled dog racing, on equal 
footing and with equal success. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think this is sexist, but women are natural care givers," Neumann 
said. "We have an eye to see when an animal or a child is not feeling well or 
needs something. A man can train himself to do that. I think a woman has it 
naturally." 
</P>
<P>
But Neumann has no ambition to try the Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a natural sense of direction," she said. "I'd be a fool to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said: "We train our dogs to run wide-open, to sprint. Those dogs 
are trained to go 100 miles in a day. If Susan (Butcher) came down here and we 
ran our teams together, I could probably beat her in 10 miles, but then mine 
would (fade)." 
</P>
<P>
But quit? No way. 
</P>
<P>
Over the speaker, Casler announces, "From trailside, we have another runaway 
team."

BAIRD ORCHESTRATES SPONSORSHIP DEALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Baird, a former world-class pole vaulter and member of the 1976 Australian 
Olympic team, has become an entrepreneur specializing in getting large 
corporations and high school sports organizations together. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when the Oregon High School Activities Assn., which is that 
state's governing body of high school sports, was almost broke, Baird 
orchestrated a deal that helped keep the organization solvent. 
</P>
<P>
He enlisted sponsorships from several corporations, then later put together a 
deal with a bank that has brought the association $750,000 in the last 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in trouble," said Bud Lewis, director of the association. "He helped 
save high school athletics in Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
Baird grew up in Australia, trained in West Germany and attended Cal State Long 
Beach, where he was the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. indoor pole vault 
champion in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
His first major deal was for the Oregon association and he has organized deals 
or is in the process of putting together projects for high school organizations 
in 13 states, including California. His biggest deal so far has been a 
$1.2-million, 3-year arrangement for the California Interscholastic Federation 
with Reebok and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Baird formed School Properties Inc. in Yorba Linda and hired a staff 
with a plan for licensing high school apparel and products in the same manner 
that NFL Properties Inc. has made millions for owners of National Football 
League teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 2 weeks, each of the CIF's 10 sections will vote on whether to 
authorize the CIF to negotiate with School Properties as its licensing body.

TAC WILL HOLD ANOTHER MEETING ON SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The third and last hearing for track and field athletes and coaches who 
competed in a series of meets in South Africa last fall will be held here 
today, with the participants facing indefinite suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
A panel for The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and 
field, may also decide the length of the suspensions for all the individuals 
who participated. The length has yet to be specified. 
</P>
<P>
Among the athletes requested to attend today's hearing are Carol Cady, the U.S. 
record-holder in the discus; John Powell, bronze medalist in the discus at the 
1976 and 1984 Olympics; Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian at 800 and 1,500 meters, 
and James Robinson, the 1979 Pan American Games champion at 800 meters. The 
case of Skip Robinson, track coach at Pasadena City College, also will be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two athletes who were suspended at the first hearing, in Chicago 
Nov. 18, will have their cases heard today. Neither long jumper Tyrus Jefferson 
nor pole vaulter Tom Hintnaus was able to attend the Chicago hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven athletes and coaches have been suspended indefinitely for participating 
in the tour, which went to three South African cities last October. Track and 
field athletes are prohibited from competing in South Africa because the 
country is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the 
sport's world governing body. South Africa was suspended from the organization 
in 1976 because of its official policy of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rich Nichols, a panel member, the case of Ted Banks, track coach 
at Riverside City College, may also be heard. Banks' case was deferred from a 
Dec. 15 hearing in Covina after a legal disagreement about TAC's jurisdiction 
over a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Four athletes from Riverside competed on the tour, and Banks is under fire from 
student groups at the school for his role as a tour organizer. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout continues for Banks. This week, a prominent African athlete, under 
pressure from his government, withdrew from Riverside City College. Julius 
Kariuki of Kenya, the Olympic gold medalist in the steeplechase at Seoul, was 
reportedly told that because of Banks' participation in the South African tour, 
Kariuki could no longer compete for the school. Kariuki set several national 
junior college records at Riverside last season. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said that if time permitted, the panel would set forth the specific 
penalties for each participant. The sanctions are expected to vary according to 
the extent of the individual's participation and his knowledge of the 
ramifications of going to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The question in my mind is if the athletes understood how this would affect 
their Olympic eligibility," Nichols said.

DEADEYE OF A PUPIL PROVES HAYES A FINE TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lance Moore of Burroughs of Ridgecrest shot down Canyon, 57-54, in a Golden 
League game last week with a shooting technique that he learned from Canyon 
Coach Greg Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Moore scored a game-high 14 points, including 12 in the second half, to lead 
the first-place Burros. Moore also hit a critical fourth-quarter 3-point shot 
that proved to be the difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
When Moore approached Hayes afterward, the player attributed his performance to 
his one-time instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You're the one who taught me how to shoot,' " Hayes said. "I didn't 
remember him until he said that. He was really sincere." 
</P>
<P>
And a good pupil. During a 1987 "Shot Doctor" clinic at Thousand Oaks High, 
Hayes helped Moore sharpen his shot. "He worked really hard at it," Hayes 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
Then he shot down Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real mixed emotions," Hayes said. "I grabbed him in a headlock and 
said, 'If I knew you'd have gone to Burroughs, I would have screwed you up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Game rescheduled: Friday night's San Fernando Valley League boys' basketball 
showdown between Notre Dame and Bell-Jeff has been rescheduled for Saturday 
night at 7 because of a scheduling conflict with the Bell-Jeff gym. Notre Dame 
(9-8 overall) and Bell-Jeff (15-1) are both 3-0 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Add schedule change: The Delphic League game between Crossroads and Faith 
Baptist scheduled for Tuesday has been postponed until Jan. 28 because of final 
exams at Crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
Although Crossroads requested the change, Faith Baptist may benefit. Jason 
Henderson, the Contenders' 6-10 center, was injured in last week's victory over 
Providence and did not play in a loss to Bel-Air Prep on Saturday, the team's 
first defeat in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to be accusing," Faith Baptist Coach Dean Lobdell said, "but it seems 
every year we play Crossroads they try to reschedule one of our games. I have 
been coaching here for five years and it always happens. This time it may help 
us, though, because Jason should be recovered." 
</P>
<P>
Last add schedule: Taft's game at El Camino Real, originally scheduled for 7 
tonight, has been rescheduled for 4 p.m. Taft Coach Jim Woodard voiced 
objections over playing a midweek night game because players who are bused get 
home at 11 p.m. or later. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys don't get home until real late, and if they have homework or 
something they're up even later," Woodard said. "Then they get up at 5 or 5:30 
the next day and it's just too tough on them." 
</P>
<P>
Rescheduling the game, however, will hold down attendance, El Camino Real Coach 
McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad because it's our best rivalry and we'd like to play in front of 
more people," McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the rivalry was especially close. Taft won the first game, 58-57, 
in double overtime, and the second, 45-42. 
</P>
<P>
Sidelined: Sophomore David Harbour, who leads Camarillo in scoring, assists and 
is second in rebounding, probably will not play in tonight's Marmonte League 
game against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Despite spraining his left ankle in the fourth quarter of the Scorpions' 77-47 
win over Channel Islands last week, Harbour scored 37 points. He did not play 
in Friday's 66-62 win over Thousand Oaks.

Senior Administration officials are investigating possible risks to national 
security in a proposed sale of a computer-related operation of Monsanto Co. to 
a West German company, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves the proposed sale of Monsanto Electronic Materials of Palo 
Alto to Huels AG of West Germany. The American company, an operating division 
of the giant Monsanto chemical company headquartered in St. Louis, produces 
silicon wafers, the flat disks used to make computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
Silicon wafers are the building blocks for the semiconductor industry, a sector 
of the U.S. economy considered vital not only for national security but also 
for trade reasons. America's edge in the battle with foreign competitors has 
centered on such high-technology fields as computer manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale to the West German company was reviewed in a closed-door 
meeting Tuesday by the Committee on Foreign Investment. The committee is 
composed of officials from eight government agencies and is headed by David C. 
Mulford, an assistant Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The panel has until next Monday to forward a recommendation to the President. 
It is expected that the proposed sale will be one of the first trade issues 
that President-elect Bush will have to face. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Commerce Department and the Defense Department raised questions 
about the proposed sale. However, an attorney representing Monsanto said 
Tuesday that he believed that the original objections had been dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met with (government officials) on numerous occasions. We answered all 
of the questions and repeat questions," Washington lawyer Joseph F. Dennin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Held 
</P>
<P>
An official at the West German Embassy said the U.S. review of the proposed 
sale is a routine procedural move. 
</P>
<P>
Earle H. Harbison Jr., president of Monsanto, and Carl Krauch, chairman of 
Huels, a subsidiary of the giant West German conglomerate Veba AG, both met 
with Reagan Administration officials on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials said no announcement of the panel's 
recommendation would be released before it was reviewed by the President, who 
has 15 days under law to reach a decision on the panel's findings. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar case two years ago, under different law, national security 
concerns forced the Japanese company Fujitsu Ltd. to give up a planned purchase 
of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., which had operations in California but was 
owned by the French company Schlumberger Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department objected, and Fujitsu dropped its planned purchase. 
Fairchild was later bought by San Francisco-based National Semiconductor Corp.

BIG YEAR FOR BIG BANKS;

<P>
REDUCED OVERHEAD, THIRD WORLD REPAYMENTS REVERSE EARNINGS DISASTER OF '87 
</P>

<P>
Security Pacific and Wells Fargo reported record profits Tuesday, reflecting 
tight expense control, increased income and big reductions in loans to Latin 
American countries. 
</P>
<P>
The state's second- and third-largest banks joined a growing list of big banks 
posting strong results both for the fourth quarter and for 1988 as a whole. 
Once overall final figures are compiled, the nation's banks are expected to 
report the most profitable year ever after their provisions for troubled Third 
World loans created an earnings disaster in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp, the largest U.S. banking company, said Tuesday that its 
fourth-quarter earnings rose to $747 million from $621 million a year earlier. 
The New York bank's earnings for 1988 were a record $1.86 billion, up from a 
loss of $1.1 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Morgan, parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York, said its 
fourth-quarter earnings were up 15.2% to $258.1 million and earnings for the 
year were $1 billion. On Monday, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover also 
reported sharp increases in earnings for the quarter and the year. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles-based Security Pacific, the nation's fifth-largest banking 
company, fourth-quarter profit was $169.5 million. The figure contrasted with a 
$39.4-million loss in the fourth quarter of 1987, which was caused by a special 
$350-million set-aside for Latin American debt. Excluding the special 
provision, 1987 fourth-quarter income would have been $156.9 million, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Landmark Year' 
</P>
<P>
Like most other big banks, Security Pacific benefited from back-interest 
payments from Brazil, which contributed $58 million to its income in the 
quarter. Brazil had stopped paying interest on its loans to U.S. banks, but an 
accord reached last summer led to a resumption in the payments in return for 
new loans. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific also reaped the benefits of improved earnings on its loans, 
tough efforts to control costs of staff and overhead, and a sharp reduction in 
outstanding loans to Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company posted record earnings of $638.9 million for the year 
and its chairman and chief executive, Richard J. Flamson III, called 1988 "a 
landmark year." 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific has suffered from double-digit increases in expenses in recent 
years, and Flamson promised shareholders last spring that growth would be kept 
below 5% in 1988. The bank said Tuesday that expenses were up 4.9% over the 
previous year, despite the acquisition of Hibernia Bank in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
One way the company kept expenses down was eliminating branches operated by its 
principal subsidiary, Security Pacific National Bank. The Los Angeles-based 
unit closed 65 branches in 1988, although opening some new offices and adding 
Hibernia resulted in a net reduction of only 40 branches. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's aggressive effort to reduce its loans to lesser-developed countries 
brought the total to $520 million at year's end, compared to $1.82 billion a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Staff Costs 
</P>
<P>
Troubled domestic loans declined slightly in 1988 despite problems at the 
company's Arizona subsidiary, Security Pacific Bank Arizona. Troubled real 
estate loans at the Arizona bank rose nearly $100 million, reflecting economic 
difficulties in the state, the bank said. But Security Pacific said 
improvements at other units meant that bad domestic loans were down to $1.2 
billion from $1.23 billion at the end of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings improvement was reflected in two key measures of bank operations, 
return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). ROE rose to 18.9% from 16% 
the year before and ROA was up to 0.84% from 0.71%. The 1987 figures were 
adjusted to remove the effects of the special provisions for loans to the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific still trailed Wells Fargo, the state's most efficient big 
bank, in those two areas. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo, the nation's 10th-largest banking company, said its ROE for 1988 
was 23.99%, up from an adjusted figure of 17.39% in 1987, and that ROA was 
1.14%, up from 0.85%. The sharp improvements were the result of record earnings 
for the year of $512.5 million at the San Francisco bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overhead Up 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the fourth quarter was $136 million at Wells, up 22% from $111.2 
million a year ago. The bank reported strong gains in net interest income, the 
difference between what it charges customers for loans and what it pays for 
deposits, and in fee income. 
</P>
<P>
Staff and overhead costs at Wells Fargo were $381.8 million for the quarter, up 
slightly from $370.6 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase 
reflected the acquisition of Barclays Bank of California in 1988. The bank said 
total expenses for the year were $1.5 billion, the same as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo slashed its exposure to Latin American countries by selling loans 
at a heavy discount. The bank reduced its total loans to lesser-developed 
countries to $245 million from $1.4 billion over the year. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo has the highest relative exposure of any big bank to loans for 
leveraged buyouts as well as heavy exposure to real estate construction 
lending, factors that have caused concern among some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The year-end report showed no signs of trouble in either area, however, and 
Wells Fargo officials have said consistently that they are confident about 
their ability to withstand problems in real estate or with highly leveraged 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most big banks, Wells Fargo received little back interest from Brazil. 
The total, $5.8 million, was used to reduce the principal on its outstanding 
loans to the country, rather than counted as income. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp's earnings got a big boost from $436 million in back interest payments 
from Brazil, which help make up for what the bank said were weaker trading 
income and higher expenses. Citicorp cut its loans to lesser-developed 
countries by $1.2 billion in 1988, leaving a total of $12.1 billion at year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
At Morgan Guaranty, back interest from Brazil contributed $240 million to net 
income for the fourth quarter and helped push the year's earnings to $1 
billion. Morgan said its total loans to the Third World dropped $800 million in 
1988 to $4.6 billion.

PARAMOUNT WILL GAIN FOOTHOLD IN BROADCASTING; 
</P>
<P>
COULD GET MAJORITY STAKE IN 5 TV STATIONS UNDER DEAL WITH SALOMON BROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Pictures, which has been looking to join the ranks of entertainment 
firms that own television stations, agreed Tuesday to acquire the right to buy 
a majority stake in struggling TVX Broadcast Group from the New York investment 
banking firm Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative agreement now gives Paramount prospects of ending up with a 79% 
interest in five independent UHF stations. Four of them are located in the 
nation's top 10 TV markets: WTAF in Philadelphia, WDCA in Washington, KTXH in 
Houston and KTXA in Dallas-Ft. Worth. The fifth is WLFL in Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Although the price for a future purchase was not announced, an industry 
executive familiar with the deal put it at about $125 million. Salomon has 
about $140 million invested in its TVX stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Syndicator 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction by analysts, speaking without benefit of details, was that 
the complex transaction looked like a good opportunity for Paramount to enter 
the broadcasting field at a relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
The motion picture studio, a subsidiary of New York-based Gulf &amp; Western, 
produces TV programs and is known as a major player in first-run syndication, 
which would fit well with station ownership. (In first-run syndication, new TV 
programs -- as opposed to reruns of shows that first appeared on network 
affiliates -- are sold to independent stations.) 
</P>
<P>
Others film producers that own TV broadcasting stations are Fox Inc., the 
parent of 20th Century Fox Film Corp., with seven former Metromedia stations; 
Walt Disney Co. with KHJ in Los Angeles and MCA Inc. with WWOR in the New York 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount deal for TVX has a unique backdrop. Salomon ended up with its 79% 
interest almost inadvertently, having made a short-term "bridge" loan to TVX 
for its acquisition of five stations from Taft Broadcasting for $240 million in 
April, 1987. Salomon then found itself unable to arrange high-yield "junk bond" 
financing that would pay off its loan. 
</P>
<P>
Under a recapitalization of the Virginia Beach, Va.-based broadcaster last 
November, Salomon swapped its TVX debt for preferred and common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, debt-burdened TVX had encountered various financial difficulties, 
posting a $48-million loss in 1987. Its stock price, which was about $12 a 
share shortly after going public in October, 1985, dropped sharply in the 
October, 1987, market crash. The stock kept going down, leveling off at about 
$2 a share. It rose $1.625 a share Tuesday on the news of the Paramount deal, 
closing at $3.875 in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
TVX now owns nine independent TV stations, but four have been designated for 
sale in connection with the recapitalization. It recently sold one of its 
independent stations, WCIX in Miami, to CBS Inc. for $59 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Paramount is to put up only $10.4 million for an initial 
transaction that will launch it into a joint venture with Salomon. The 
announcement said Salomon would contribute TVX equity securities representing 
about 51% of TVX's outstanding voting common stock, and Paramount would acquire 
49% of the joint venture, thus controlling about one-quarter of TVX. The 
transaction is subject to reaching a definitive agreement and regulatory 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Price Unknown 
</P>
<P>
After entering the joint venture, Paramount would have a four-year option to 
buy out Salomon's entire interest in TVX, sources said. Depending on various 
factors, one said, the full price would range between $125 million and $180 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell the real price" from information in the announcement, noted 
Jeffrey Logsdon, a securities analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los 
Angeles. He added that the "debacle" of TVX apparently paved the way for 
Paramount to realize its plans of entering TV broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Christopher Dixon of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York said the 
reputed price would make it possible "to test the waters and "get a handle on" 
how a TV station group operates "at a very low cost."

ICAHN BOOSTS STAKE IN TEXACO, MAY SEEK CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn disclosed Tuesday that he has raised his 
stake in Texaco Inc. to 16.6% and confirmed that he was preparing for the 
possibility of a second fight for control of the oil giant. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn also accused Texaco management of breaking a promise to shareholders by 
devising a new anti-takeover defense to replace one that expires April 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It has come to my attention that Texaco management -- again without 
shareholder approval -- is about to further insulate itself from accountability 
by changing their existing 'poison pill' to make it even more toxic," Icahn 
said in a letter to Texaco President James W. Kinnear. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who six months ago lost a bitter struggle against management for control 
of Texaco's board, was responding to an article in Tuesday's editions of the 
Wall Street Journal. The newspaper reported that Texaco was preparing to 
replace its expiring poison-pill takeover defense with a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said the new strategy was an attempt to "preclude a bid for Texaco by me 
or by anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Texaco assured shareholders during its proxy battle against Icahn that it would 
eliminate the poison pill, which is aimed at making a hostile takeover 
prohibitively expensive. Analysts have said that promise was largely 
responsible for Texaco's victory in the proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco then promised the committee representing its shareholders in the 
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that it would not issue another 
poison pill without the approval of shareholders or authorization from an 
investment banking firm designated by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Texaco stock rose 
50 cents to close at $53.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that the shareholders committee had designated the 
investment banker Rothschild Inc. to issue a new defense and that Kinnear and 
Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane had visited Rothschild's offices about a 
successor to the poison pill. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis O'Dea, counsel for the equity committee, denied the panel had made any 
such designation. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnear issued a statement late Tuesday saying, "This is another case of Carl 
Icahn protesting without knowing what is being proposed and making claims 
solely for his own benefit." 
</P>

Kinnear said Texaco is considering an interim plan to take effect when the 
existing pill expires in April. That plan would be in effect until shareholders 
have the opportunity to vote on it in at Texaco's annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco officials said the plan would not preclude any legitimate offers for the 
company but "would avoid anyone's acquiring control of Texaco through creeping 
purchases, to the detriment of other Texaco shareholders."

FIRM PLANS TV NEWS SHOW FOR SCHOOLS, INCLUDING ADS 
</P>

A specialty publishing firm plans to start testing a daily television news 
program -- complete with commercials -- that would be beamed from Los Angeles 
into classrooms nationwide in an ambitious and controversial effort to court 
teen-age consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle Communications will spend $5 million to test "Channel One" and has 
hired Susan Winston, a former producer of ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" to 
head production, which will be based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The five-week test of the program -- controversial because it involves showing 
commercials in the classroom -- will begin March 6 and involve four to six high 
schools and middle schools across the country, officials said. So far, only two 
schools, one in Detroit and another in Kansas City, Kan., have agreed to 
participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-minute program would combine news, features, educational material and 
two minutes worth of commercials, according to Whittle officials. "Channel One" 
would be transmitted via satellite to schools during the morning, but school 
officials can tape the show for broadcast at a later time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Equipment 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a news show, such as the "Today" show or "Good Morning America" 
done for teens," said Donna Cheek, a spokeswoman for Nashville, Tenn.-based 
Whittle, which currently distributes magazines and other promotional material 
to 10,000 schools. Time Inc. recently bought a 50% stake in Whittle 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle will provide the schools with $50,000 worth of equipment -- such as 
television monitors, videocassette recorders and satellite dishes -- free of 
charge. Sponsors would pay the estimated $100 million needed to launch the 
program nationwide and reach 51 million students and their 2.8 million 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Cheek said the program, the first TV show for Whittle, will not accept ads for 
alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, contraceptives and feminine hygiene 
products. Each school principal will be able to preview the day's show and may 
prohibit the program from being shown if it is deemed unsuitable for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program could be a valuable tool in reaching teen-age consumers, says 
Peter Zollo, executive vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a 
marketing research firm based in Oak Brook, Ill. Although the number of 
teen-agers has fallen since 1975, teens have seen their spending power balloon 
to about $79 billion annually -- up 20% since 1985, Zollo said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reaching Target 
</P>
<P>
Teens also have a greater say in what their parents buy and actually are 
spending more time in stores shopping for their families, Zollo says. Many 
companies also want a head start toward building customer loyalty and 
recognition among future consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising on "Channel One" is an opportunity for companies to "associate 
themselves with quality programming and getting a targeted group of students 
who are, in some ways, captive" in the classroom, Zollo said. 
</P>
<P>
Ads and corporate promotions have filtered into the classroom in the past. 
Schools have readily accepted, for example, chemistry kits or research material 
bearing corporate logos. But outright commercials for products are quite rare. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically you won't see those things in the classrooms," said Bob Greene, 
coordinator of production at KLCS-TV, an educational station operated by the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. "If you did, it would be by mistake. A 
teacher might have taped something on television at home and might have forgot 
to erase the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
The commercials will likely meet with skepticism and resistance from many 
educators and others. Action for Children's Television, for example, has 
already voiced its opposition to the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads Pays for Gear 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that when kids are in school, they should not be 
subject to commercials during instructional time," said Dan Isaacs, who 
oversees senior high schools for the Los Angeles Unified School District. "Our 
schools would welcome the additional equipment," he said, "but the commercial 
aspects would have to be reviewed very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Whittle says that it is aware of potential resistance to the commercials. But 
the company said it could not afford to supply the television equipment, which 
can be used by schools for other purposes, free of charge without commercials. 
</P>
<P>
'It would be wonderful if you could bring the technology into the classroom 
without ads," Cheek said. "But it's not happening."

Jury selection began in the second trial of GAF Corp. and a senior executive on 
stock-manipulation charges that grew indirectly out of the Wall Street insider 
trading scandal. The first trial ended Jan. 10 in a mistrial after U.S. 
District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe ruled that prosecutors had improperly withheld 
information about a key piece of evidence from the defense. More than 100 
potential jurors filled out questionnaires for the new trial and went home. 
Prosecutors and defense attorneys planned to start questioning them 
individually today.

Marriott Corp. and Huntsman Chemical Corp. have agreed to provide and package 
meals for passengers of the Soviet airline Aeroflot. Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. 
Dubinin held a joint news conference with the heads of the two U.S. companies, 
J.W. Marriott Jr. of Washington and Jon Huntsman of Salt Lake City, to give 
details of the joint ventures set up without pubic announcement in Moscow last 
month. Aeroflot already has contracts with Marriott to provide meals on its 
airplanes at several airports outside the Soviet Union.

Road Entertainment, has been relieved of his duties by the company's directors. 
The independent film production company, which Friedman had founded in 1981 and 
took public four years later, said the chairman's duties would be assumed by a 
committee of three outside directors, Herbert Hurwitz, Cy Leslie and William P. 
Miller. The company also said it will "implement a management restructuring and 
will continue its production and foreign distribution operations."

U.S. OIL BRIEFLY TOPS $19 AS OPEC ADHERES TO QUOTAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. oil prices topped $19 a barrel Tuesday for the first time in over a year 
on signs that OPEC is adhering to a new production accord, but they later fell 
back slightly due to profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
In volatile trading, the February contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose as high as $19.21 a barrel, its highest since November, 1987, but then 
retreated. It ended the day at $18.95, with a gain of 7 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were subject 
to a new output limit of 18.5 million barrels daily beginning Jan. 1, as the 
cartel tried to end the high production that had sent world oil prices 
tumbling. In December, the OPEC members produced an estimated 22.8 million 
barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is higher and OPEC is the underlying cause," said Peter Beutel of 
Elders Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimism on Talks 
</P>
<P>
The pact, which replaced lower limits that were widely ignored, was adopted in 
late November. Since then, prices have risen nearly $4 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Beutel said OPEC production fell to around 19.35 million barrels daily in the 
first half of January. 
</P>
<P>
He said the market's strength also reflected optimism toward talks between OPEC 
and non-OPEC producers set for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
But the surge above $19 seemed to make some traders nervous. Stephen Platt, 
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the recent rally in prices made the 
market vulnerable to some profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic correction after a fundamental move up," said Madison 
Galbraith, broker at Merrill Lynch Futures. "Enough people took profits to keep 
a lid on the market around $19 a barrel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other grades of oil, North Sea Brent crude was up about 20 cents at 
$17.20 a barrel for February delivery on the spot market, where actual barrels 
of oil are traded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Prices Higher 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the signs of OPEC restraint, the market has also been buoyed by 
strong demand for oil products. 
</P>
<P>
The government's Energy Information Administration reported Monday that total 
products supplied in the four weeks ended Dec. 30 were up 4.9% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The brisk sales pace was expected to be carried through to the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil failed to share in the enthusiasm for crude, however. The February 
contract was down 0.11 cents at 53.05 cents a gallon, due to relatively warm 
temperatures in much of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose, with the February contract for unleaded gas up 0.19 cents 
at 51.10 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts that expire in the summer rose sharply. A number of states in the 
Northeast are due to impose rules in the summer on pollution from gasoline 
vapors, and analysts say the new rules will reduce the amount of gasoline that 
can be yielded from each barrel of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
The May, June and July gas contracts all rose the 2-cent daily limit allowed, 
closing at around 54 cents a gallon.

L. F. ROTHSCHILD ENDS ROLE AS PRIMARY DEALER 
</P>

L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday that it has withdrawn as a primary 
dealer, making it the second institution in less than a week to defect from the 
exclusive club of bond dealers that trade directly with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild, a subsidiary of L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., said its departure, 
which will leave 44 primary dealers to trade with the Federal Reserve, was 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild also said it will discontinue its U.S. government securities sales 
and trading activities except for trading in its own account. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild said that, while its capital exceeded the Federal Reserve's new 
requirements for primary dealers, the return on capital devoted to its 
government securities operations was insufficient to warrant continuation of 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
A rumor that Rothschild would leave the primary dealer business circulated 
widely Friday when County Natwest Government Securities Inc., a subsidiary of 
Britain's National Westminster Bank PLC, said it was quitting the overcrowded 
and often unprofitable business. County Natwest had been a primary dealer for 
less than four months when it made its surprise announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is pretty obvious right now that the valuation for government dealerships 
is dropping through the floor. Given the pressure of new volume and capital 
requirements (by the Fed), a lot of firms are probably debating whether to stay 
in the business," a dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
Primary dealerships are special rights granted by the Federal Reserve to deal 
directly with the government when it issues debt securities. The 
once-prestigious role as the government-sanctioned bond dealer has been losing 
its appeal as intense competition cuts profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's maneuvering of government securities in the open market is closely 
watched for clues to monetary policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
Primary dealers' trading screens are believed to offer the firms a prized seat 
in determining market trends. 
</P>
<P>
But several managers of existing primary dealerships complain that as the 
number of dealers expanded, from 36 at the end of 1985, the crowded conditions 
have made profitability more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said at least half of the primary dealers were not profitable in 1988. 
Some said only seven firms made profits. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Gamarci, chairman and chief executive of Lloyds Government Securities 
Corp., a unit of Lloyds Bank PLC, said the difficulty of meeting the Fed's new 
volume requirements is forcing firms out. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 17, the Fed doubled minimum capital requirements of dealers to $50 
million and said the dollar value of dealers' transactions in Treasury and 
Federal agency issues should average 1% of primary dealer volume.

NOVEMBER SALES KEEP STEP WITH INVENTORIES, EASING FEARS OF BUILDUP

Business inventories rose 0.4% in November and sales increased at the same 
pace, the government said Tuesday in a report that analysts said bodes well for 
the nation's economy in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots rose to 
a seasonally adjusted $753.6 billion in November, while sales reached $503.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The matching 0.4% gains kept the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.50, meaning 
it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the November sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can signal 
economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order production cuts 
and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods. 
</P>
<P>
But John Hagens of WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the new report 
indicates that "at least from the inventories point of view, we think the 
economy is in pretty good shape for continued growth in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, before a recession, inventories tend to build up. There's no 
evidence of any kind of excesses in inventories in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Positive Sign 
</P>
<P>
The November increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise in October and a 
0.9% jump in September. It was the 23rd straight month in which inventories had 
risen, but sales generally have kept pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like inventories closed out the year on a very lean note, which 
should be a positive sign in terms of growth in the first half of this year," 
said Michael Evans, a forecaster in Washington. "People remained somewhat 
skeptical about the durability of the recovery. They kept their inventories 
rather lean." 
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase in sales was down from a 1.3% increase in October and 
virtually unchanged sales activity in September. 
</P>
<P>
The November sales gain was led by a 0.9% rise at the retail level, followed by 
a 0.5% increase at the manufacturing level. These two gains offset a 0.4% 
decline in sales at the wholesale level. 
</P>
<P>
The government last week reported that retail sales in December rose a 
lackluster 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in inventories was led by a 0.7% rise in retailers' inventories, 
followed by a 0.4% increase for manufacturers and virtually no change in 
wholesale stockpiles.

Rockwell International Corp. said its first-quarter earnings were down 17% to 
$160 million from the year-ago period, when profits were boosted by a 
$50-million tax gain related to production of the B-1B bomber. The El Segundo 
aerospace, electronics and industrial company added that sales for the quarter 
were $2.87 billion, up 7%. The results include gains by electronics, automotive 
and graphics, although aerospace earnings were off because of the completion in 
1988 of B-1B production.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NIXON'S MEDIA MEMO TO NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Nixon advising George Bush on handling the media is like Quasimodo 
giving advice on grooming and personal hygiene. Or Dracula promoting a balanced 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
It's been said by his enemies that the only way to get rid of Nixon is to drive 
a stake through his heart. Perhaps, for the former President continues somehow 
to flourish as a post-Watergate author/elder statesman. And here he is in this 
week's TV Guide, now playing the unlikely role of media consultant under the 
headline "Memo to President Bush: How to Use TV -- and Keep from Being Abused 
By It." 
</P>
<P>
Now that is quaint and amusing, for if ever a politician continually sank his 
fangs into and exchanged jugular bites with the media, it was Nixon, who not 
only failed to woo or understand them, but frequently antagonized and blamed 
them for his problems and failures. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned at least one lesson from his own experience, Nixon does not urge 
Bush to hunch his shoulders, thrust his arms above his head and make "V" signs 
with his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
At once the most valid and redundant advice that Bush gets from Nixon is not to 
expect to match Ronald Reagan's success on television. Yes, of course. But 
surely, as he approaches Friday's inauguration, Bush already knows that he is 
no Reagan in front of the camera. He knows that he tends to whine, that he 
lacks presence, that his own tendency to misspeak on TV will not be as easily 
forgiven, that he will never persuade anyone to win one strictly for the 
Busher. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to TV Presidents, there may never be another Reagan, who, for 
reasons that remain undefined, was able to blur the separation of messenger and 
message almost as soon as the red light clicked on. It mattered not whether he 
was flawlessly delivering a prepared speech or badly floundering and speaking 
Gipperish at a press conference. Reagan was Reagan. He, not what he was saying, 
was the communication. And he whizzed through it all -- almost unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
How Nixon must envy Reagan for that, for if anything screams out from the New 
Nixon's 2,000-word article in TV Guide, it's the Old Nixon's bitterness and 
paranoia about the media. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be outfoxed, outflanked and outperformed," he writes. "Unless the 
President finds a way to use them to pursue his own agenda, they will use his 
failures to pursue theirs." The same words would apply to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Nixon credits most TV reporters with being "conscientious, 
intelligent and hard-working," then proceeds to vilify them as a sort of 
faceless monolith. As you read his words and your brain replays TV pictures of 
a self-pitying Nixon assuring reporters that they won't have him "to kick 
around anymore" after failing to win the 1962 California gubernatorial race, it 
becomes clear that he is less interested now in advising Bush than in settling 
some very old scores. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Of all the institutions arrayed with and against the President, none 
controls his fate more than television." So TV will determine the destiny of 
George Bush, more even than Congress or the White House itself? Come now. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the media -- and especially TV -- are vital to any Administration, and 
the electronic age requires Presidents who have at least the basic skills to 
communicate to the nation through TV. Moreover, TV's handling of stories 
obviously does have an effect on public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
But are Presidents 99-pound weaklings or something? On the contrary, it's 
logical to conclude that the fate of Bush is chiefly in the hands of Bush, not 
TV -- just as Nixon, not TV, deserves blame for Watergate as well as credit for 
a policy toward China that many feel was visionary. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Televised press conferences should be held monthly at most. . . .The media 
have been clamoring for more news conferences, and it is certainly in their 
interests for the President to acquiesce. . . . But a news conference is only 
in the President's interest when it achieves some purpose other than satisfying 
the media's insatiable thirst for confrontation. Contrary to the media's 
fulminations, the public does not much care how often the President has a press 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
This is an argument for less access -- if not outright secrecy. More televised 
press conferences are merely in the media's interest? The media are interested 
only in confrontation? The public doesn't care? 
</P>
<P>
Granted, televised press conferences are flawed, sometimes yield little 
information and too often lead to showboating -- by the President and 
reporters. They are, however, extremely valuable as a rare, direct link to 
power. What's more, they set the President adrift in a relatively uncontrolled 
environment and allow Americans to see for themselves if he is physically and 
mentally fit or is foaming at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, here is one more piece of advice for Bush from another source: Ignore 
Dick's tricks of the trade and set your own course, knowing that although the 
media aren't perfect, they're the only media we have. 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing: Neither overestimate nor underestimate the power of 
pictures, and thank your lucky stars that it wasn't you the cameras caught 
riding around in a tank.

ABC GIRDING FOR POSSIBILITY OF ACTORS STRIKE, STODDARD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still reeling from the blows dealt to program development by last summer's 
Writers Guild of America strike, ABC is gearing up for a possible strike by the 
Screen Actors Guild this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Stoddard, the third of the major network entertainment chiefs to 
address national TV writers and critics gathered here for the networks' annual 
winter press tour, said that ABC is already in discussion with the studios 
about strike plans. These include the possibility of extending production 
schedules in the spring to begin shooting series episodes for next season, or 
of going back into production early for next season's shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope and pray the SAG strike doesn't happen," he said. "The effects of the 
writers strike won't be over for a year, it's still a blow to development. . . 
. The quality is hurting, and it's going to take a long time for us to 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
Despite strike-related delays that kept some of its shows off the air until 
November and early December, ABC has emerged as the No. 2 network in prime time 
this season -- and Stoddard expressed some understated pride in the network's 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made a little headway," he said. "I'm relatively happy." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's upswing began last winter, when its Winter Olympics coverage earned solid 
ratings and gave the network a chance to promote new mid-season programs, 
including "The Wonder Years." ABC's luck continued with a double Emmy win for 
the 1987-88 season: "The Wonder Years" was named best comedy series, and 
another first-season entry, "thirtysomething," won as best drama series. 
</P>
<P>
Despite ABC's recent morale boost, there are two things Stoddard might be 
relatively unhappy about: trouble on the set of the new hit series "Roseanne" 
and low ratings for the November broadcast of the first half of the 
$110-million "War and Remembrance" miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard said that, while "we're keeping an eye on it," he believes that the 
problems on "Roseanne" have been solved. Matt Williams, creator and 
co-executive producer of the series, in which Roseanne Barr stars as a wife, 
mother and blue-collar worker, recently departed the show, saying that Barr had 
refused to work on the final nine episodes of the season unless he left. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard dismissed the suggestion that Barr's temperament might prove the 
undoing of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Roseanne is extremely sensitive as a performer about her character, 
and I don't blame her," he said, adding that Barr's unusual contract with the 
production company -- which gives her creative control of her character -- was 
designed so that she could protect the trademark persona she has developed 
through her stand-up comedy routines. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC executive acknowledged disappointment at the low ratings for "War and 
Remembrance," which the network rushed onto the air last November to fill the 
programming gap left by the writers strike. He blamed neither the rescheduling 
nor promotion for its performance, however, pointing instead to the program's 
failure to draw the under-55 audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit disappointed," he said. "I think 'War and Remembrance' is a 
hell of a piece of film. The people who saw the movie were the ones who knew a 
lot of those scenes in the first place. We were certainly aware of the 
vulnerability of 'War and Remembrance' with the younger audience." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard said the second half of the miniseries, which will be 12 to 12 1/2 
hours long, will air as scheduled in May, with no special effort planned to 
attract the younger audience this time. He joked that the more upbeat second 
half should improve the ratings: "We have this great surprise ending -- we win 
the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the controversy that has greeted the Jan. 23 rerun of "The Day 
After," exploring the effects of a nuclear holocaust, Stoddard said the 
decision to trim the movie by 23 minutes and 18 seconds was not an effort to 
sabotage the film. The decision was prompted, he said, by a promise he made to 
the network's affiliated stations that "we would never have a made-for-TV movie 
that went past 11 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Meyer, the film's director, has protested the alterations and has 
asked to have his name removed from the credits. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard said that he did not think the film suffered from the cuts, which he 
said included such extraneous scenes as someone driving a car. 
</P>
<P>
"As a movie, I don't think it was the best movie we ever made," he said. "I've 
seen the recut movie and it's fine -- believe me, if it wasn't, (I'd be) a very 
unhappy human being." 
</P>
<P>
He said the film was extraordinary as an event, but not as film making -- and 
was not damaged or improved by the cuts of "a few seconds here, a few seconds 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, Stoddard turned to the topic of "trash TV" or "tabloid TV," one of 
the press tour's hotter topics. During the CBS portion of the press events last 
week, CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer gloated over the critical 
drubbing NBC took last fall for airing Geraldo Rivera's "Devil Worship: 
Exposing Satan's Underground" and the TV movie "Favorite Son," the story of a 
vice presidential candidate running on looks rather than ability. Stringer 
added proudly that CBS immediately turned down the opportunity to purchase 
future Rivera specials when a Rivera representative approached the network. 
</P>
<P>
When Rivera and company approached ABC, Stoddard said, "We listened in our 
polite, quiet way, waited one day -- and then turned them down." He added that 
ABC's reason was as much due to having had too many specials in development 
already as distaste for Rivera's style of reporting.

BENSON EXPLORES FUGARD'S 'ROAD TO MECCA' AT SCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staging of "The Road to Mecca" on the Mainstage at South Coast Repertory 
marks the third play by Athol Fugard that Martin Benson has directed at the 
Costa Mesa theater -- more than that of any other playwright. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the 51-year-old South Coast co-founder is more readily associated with Shaw 
and Synge because of the accolades heaped upon his staging of their works. 
"Misalliance" in 1987 and "The Playboy of the Western World" in 1985 won 14 Los 
Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards between them. 
</P>
<P>
"The humanness of Fugard's plays is what lures me," Benson said in a recent 
interview. "The people are so utterly real. And they are all in a situation of 
extremis. Fugard is a great storyteller. I don't necessarily think he is a 
great poet, say, as Tennessee Williams is. But his stories are so trenchant." 
</P>
<P>
The first play by the South African playwright to draw Benson's attention was 
"Blood Knot," a primal tale of love and hate between two black brothers -- one 
of whom can and does pass for white. Benson mounted the play in 1982. The 
second, staged in 1985, was "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," a parable of 
shame taken from an incident in Fugard's life. 
</P>
<P>
"Fugard often writes about his own experience," said the lanky, bearded 
director. "That is why he is such a great storyteller. He can take the simplest 
incident and construct around it, creating import and impact. But it starts 
with the simplest things." 
</P>
<P>
This time especially, because the central figure in "Road to Mecca" seemed to 
Fugard glancingly remote at first. As he has written, the seed was planted 
during a drive through the village of New Bethesda in the Karoo desert, 15 
miles from where he was born in 1932. On a return trip to buy one of the 
"dirt-cheap" houses for a hideaway from the city, the playwright heard of a 
reclusive widow in the village considered crazy by the locals. 
</P>
<P>
"They said her craziness took the form of rather silly statues and sculpture 
that she made and had all around her house," Fugard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he used to stroll by her house to look at her garden of statues -- all 
facing in the direction of Mecca. But "apart from seeing her in the distance 
once or twice, and nodding at her," the playwright recalled, he "never got to 
know her personally." 
</P>
<P>
Fugard realized, of course, that the tensions between an eccentric widow and a 
town alienated by her deviation from the norm would make "a damn good story." 
Yet he was not hooked until years later, after she died, and an actress asked 
him why he "never had two women together" on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Fugard discovered that during the last years of her life, the 
woman, named Helen Martins, had developed a deep friendship with a young woman 
who taught in Cape Town and was rebelling against the mores of South African 
society at large. 
</P>
<P>
"The young woman gave me . . . a photograph of herself and Miss Helen," Fugard 
wrote. "I took one look . . . and there was my play." 
</P>
<P>
First staged in 1984 at Yale Repertory under Fugard's direction, "The Road to 
Mecca" is set in 1974 in Miss Helen's house. There are three characters -- Miss 
Helen, the young teacher Elsa who arrives one night on an urgent visit, and 
Marius Byleveld, the pastor concerned about Miss Helen's health. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most powerful messages in this play," Benson said, "is the artist's 
need to create. It doesn't necessarily have to do with a palpable appreciation 
for art, or whether the art is good even. It has to do with a particular urge 
-- genetic, psychological, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is an implicit lesson," he said, "that says the artist is a unique 
individual in society and that the artist pays an enormous price for that. 
There is a certain amount of isolation. There is an inevitable amount of 
rejection." 
</P>
<P>
More explicitly, Benson said, the drama derives its strength from the personal 
interplay between Miss Helen and Elsa, while tracing a thematic tangent about 
the moral and political climate of their country. 
</P>
<P>
"Mecca" focuses, for instance, on the difference between trust and love rather 
than exploiting "buzz words that go off in our brain -- like apartheid," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for the first time in a major Fugard play, there are no black 
characters. As for villains, Benson believes the play has none, not even 
Marius, whose values may approximate those of Pastor Manders in Ibsen's 
"Ghosts" but without his hypocritical motives. 
</P>
<P>
After his most recent Mainstage outings, the lack of villainy is something of a 
change of pace for Benson. Last season he did Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan and 
Lemon" about the banality of evil. (It featured Nan Martin, who returns to play 
Miss Helen.) In September, as the SCR fall opener, he did Arthur Miller's "The 
Crucible" about the Salem witch trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any dark moment in my soul," he said. "There was no 
tie-in in my mind. I didn't pick Miller or Fugard to satisfy some need of my 
psyche." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not. But "The Crucible," at least, must have satisfied some need in the 
public's psyche. It broke the SCR box-office record set last spring by Richard 
Sheridan's 18th-Century comedy, "The School for Scandal." 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised, moreover, that "Misalliance" had also been a box-office smash 
-- although he likes to quip that Shaw is "one of the best young writers 
writing today." 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of circles," he said, "they think of him as 'dusty old Shaw' and, 
come to think of it, a lot like Miss Helen."

SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER CHASE ON 3 FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men believed to be involved in a Costa Mesa robbery led police on a 
high-speed chase through county streets and three freeways Tuesday before one 
was arrested at a hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit began in Costa Mesa about 7 a.m. when an officer was questioning 
two men who had been sleeping in a car on Coriander Drive and they sped off, 
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol and Tustin police officers joined the pursuit as 
the men drove on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, through Tustin surface 
streets, and south on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies received calls from Laguna Hills residents 
reporting that two men were seen jumping fences and running through the 
neighborhood. Police arrested David Chris Medina, 28, of El Monte at Saddleback 
Community Hospital after a resident told officers that her husband had taken a 
man there when he came to their door and asked for help for a cut hand. 
</P>
<P>
Medina was in Costa Mesa City Jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon, felony evasion of arrest and attempted burglary. The other man remains 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the car abandoned at Paseo de Alicia and Hon Avenue in Laguna 
Hills. Inside, they found a black jacket that matched the description of one 
worn by a man who robbed a Denny's restaurant on Harbor Boulevard at 2 a.m. 
Tuesday, Webster said.

A clock restorer has presented the city with a surprise gift: He fixed an 
antique clock in the downtown area that has been stuck at 9 o'clock for more 
than 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents, merchants and visitors to Laguna deserved the time," said Brice 
Woodward of Laguna Beach, who restores wristwatches and clocks. So on Sunday he 
and two friends, Pat and Peter Becker of Costa Mesa, erected scaffolding near 
Forest Avenue and Glenneyre Street and spent about 7 hours installing parts, 
rewiring and cleaning the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Kenney recently received council approval to have the clock 
repaired but money had not been appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice civic gesture, and I appreciate all they have done," Kenney 
said. Woodward said he was "not interested in being compensated for the job." 
</P>
<P>
The clock has been in Laguna since the mid-1970s, when a merchant bought it 
from another merchant in Orange. That city, however, claimed that it and not 
the merchant owned the clock. To bypass the red tape, a small posse snatched 
the clock and bolted it to a pedestal with a concrete base in Laguna Beach, "to 
make sure nobody borrowed it," said Mike Eggers, one of the raiders and now a 
Dana Point council member.

TASK FORCE ADDRESSES REA CENTER PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a city task force met Tuesday in a continuing effort to resolve 
complaints of residents about the number of disabled and needy people who visit 
a private relief agency and other social service programs at the Rea Community 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents do not feel safe letting their children walk to school," said Barbara 
Littrell, one of three residents on the eight-member task force. According to 
Littrell, children have been followed and panhandled by transients near the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Increased crime, traffic and littering were among the eight major complaints of 
area residents who responded to a questionnaire, a task force spokesman said. 
Solutions proposed to deal with "real and perceived" problems include 
relocation of Share Ourselves (SOS), a private anti-poverty agency; changing 
bus stops, and increasing police patrols . 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said that while major crimes such as burglaries 
and rapes have declined in the area over the last 3 years, there has been an 
increase in minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems are petty theft or nuisance calls," Kent said. He 
explained that the department has increased patrols in the area to address 
nuisance complaints such as loitering and sleeping in public places. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, director of SOS, admitted some problems based on the number of 
clients but said that many complaints stem from misconceptions.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: CLASS FOR GRANDPARENTS IS A TIME FOR FAMILY SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, 57-year-old Bess Osterhues spreads herself out on the floor and 
pretends to go through labor pains. 
</P>
<P>
Her graphic position and simulated discomfort occur during the childbirth 
classes she teaches for parents. Considering that she has three children and 
has worked around babies all her adult life, Osterhues is pretty good at the 
re-creation. 
</P>
<P>
But these days Osterhues, the perinatal health coordinator at St. Jude Hospital 
in Fullerton, is also teaching a more mature group of people -- the 
grandparents. Although she isn't one herself, Osterhues knows all about that 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In her class, the registered nurse tells grandparents how the philosophy of 
raising a child has changed since they had their children, and what their 
children believe in and practice today. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the focus is not on the process of the birth but on the whole change in 
care," Osterhues said. "These days, we look at the whole family participating, 
and it has been fun developing a program that values and appreciates what each 
family member contributes." 
</P>
<P>
That practice, she added, includes having parents in the mother's hospital room 
during labor. 
</P>
<P>
Osterhues said she was able to observe some of the labor and delivery 
experiences of young women at the hospital. "Hopefully, I have learned the 
things that are important to them and the things they see as being helpful 
without being intrusive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her class attracts upward of 20 people for each session in the hospital's 
maternity wing, and the idea is for the grandparents, especially those who have 
had more than one grandchild, to share their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Grandparents are asked to remember some of the things that happened with their 
first child, said Osterhues, who became a registered nurse in 1954 and, at age 
45, went back to school to become a nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she is studying for a master's degree in health education at Cal State 
Long Beach "to broaden the way I can look at health care and open my eyes to 
provide and help promote health care at (St. Jude) hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"In general, young couples are sensible and able to make their own decisions," 
she said, adding that young people have shown a renewed interest in sharing 
their thoughts and feelings with their own parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They remember their parents survived having children," Osterhues said. No 
doubt when her children have children, it will result in her being a superstar 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Guido, a 9 1/2-year-old German shepherd police dog who will officially retire 
from the Tustin Police Department on Feb. 1, was toasted at a retirement party 
at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
Cake and dog bones were served. 
</P>
<P>
And his handler, Officer Ron Frazier, who bought the dog from the city for $1 
and will keep him as a house pet, said Guido will also receive a proclamation 
for his 5 years of service at a City Council meeting where officials will 
congratulate him and shake his paw. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Monzo's love of comic books may turn into a career for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed reading comics for a long time," said the 21-year-old Costa Mesa 
man, who is learning printing and publishing skills at the North Orange County 
Regional Occupational Program. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of his Quad Star Comics firm, all 800 copies, will be 
distributed next month at 75 cents each. Monzo, a graduate of Loara High School 
in Anaheim, is the owner, writer and only employee of Quad Star Comics. But he 
said he has friends doing the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it gains a lot of interest and sells well so I can support myself," 
Monzo said. "It's a trial-and-error thing because there's no manual on how to 
get into the comic book business." 
</P>
<P>
His first comic book is called "Terror Syndrome," and the plot includes horror 
and violence. "I'd really like to make the next book more like old-time horror 
movies that were exciting, but never really showed much violence."

SUSPECT SAYS ON TAPE HE COACHED GIRL TO TAKE RAP IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county computer whiz, accused of masterminding the 1985 murder of his wife, 
acknowledged to investigators that he told his teen-age daughter to take the 
blame for the killing because she would face only a minimal sentence, a 
videotape played in court Tuesday showed. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Brown, 34, also admitted to police during the taped interview after 
his September arrest that he told his daughter how to write a suicide note and 
concocted a drug mixture to help her feign suicide after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anaheim Hills computer programmer denied orchestrating the murder of 
his wife, maintaining that he never thought his daughter and sister-in-law were 
serious about their plot to kill Linda Brown in March, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Piece of Evidence 
</P>
<P>
The videotape shown Tuesday of Brown's statement to police, what could prove to 
be the most damning evidence against him, was the final piece of evidence 
offered by prosecutors as Brown's 3-week preliminary hearing drew to a close in 
a Westminster courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Municipal Judge Floyd H. Schenk is expected to decide whether 
Brown should stand trial on murder charges. Because of a special allegation 
that Brown had his wife killed to profit financially from $835,000 in 
insurance, he could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview with police, Brown's own words seemed to suggest that he had a 
far greater knowledge -- and perhaps a more active participation -- in the 
killing of his wife than Brown had previously acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's attorney, Joel Baruch of Newport Beach, conceded that the videotape 
could prove incriminating to his client, saying in an interview: "In any 
criminal case, when a defendant talks to a police officer, and there's anything 
but an outright denial, that could pose problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explanations Wait for Trial 
</P>
<P>
Baruch added: "There are explanations for the things that are said in that 
tape, but those explanations will have to wait for the trial." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate, saying he did not want to reveal his defense to 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is accused of persuading his daughter, Cinnamon Brown, then 14, to kill 
his wife -- Cinnamon Brown's stepmother -- so he could collect on the victim's 
insurance and marry his wife's sister. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the murder, Cinnamon Brown was found in the doghouse of the 
family's Garden Grove home, apparently incoherent from an overdose of drugs. 
She left a suicide note, saying she was sorry for shooting her stepmother to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
She was convicted in the killing and has spent more than 3 years in the 
California Youth Authority facility in Camarillo. After remaining silent about 
the case, she named her father in the plot last fall, which led to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
She initially told investigators that she had not killed Linda Brown herself, 
but then admitted that she had pulled the trigger -- though only at the 
prodding of her father. 
</P>
<P>
After the killing, prosecutors allege that Brown collected $835,000 from 
several of Linda Brown's life insurance policies and, about 16 months later, 
married the victim's teen-age sister, Patty Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, living in the Browns' Garden Grove home, had been having an affair with 
David Brown while her sister was alive, prosecutors say. Bailey faces separate 
murder charges stemming from the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Witness Against Father 
</P>
<P>
Bailey is now a prime witness against her husband. She testified earlier during 
the preliminary hearing that Brown had schemed to kill Linda Brown, although 
her testimony about the murder contradicted Cinnamon Brown's on several points. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was interviewed by police Sept. 22 after his arrest on suspicion of 
murder. He initially maintained in the taped interview that he had loved his 
wife and had nothing to do with her death. But he later acknowledged, under 
sharp questioning, some knowledge of the events leading up to her death. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said in the interview that Cinnamon Brown and Bailey had been convinced 
that Brown's wife wanted to kill him, and the two teen-agers wanted to stop her 
before she could carry out the plan. Brown said at some points during the 
interview that he had not thought that Cinnamon Brown and Bailey were serious 
about hurting the victim, but he maintained at other times that he had tried to 
talk them out of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Not Stand for It 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Cinnamon) if something was going to happen to me, let it," he said. 
"There's no way I would stand for anything like" the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "If I was going to stage something (like the slaying), I would stage 
something a hell of a lot more sophisticated than this. . . . My imagination is 
very vivid." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Brown said he discussed writing suicide notes with Cinnamon Brown 
and mixed a combination of aspirin and baking soda for her to take in order to 
make it seem as if she was trying to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a conversation with his daughter in the hospital after the slaying, 
Brown told her that she should admit to the killing, he said in the interview, 
because as a juvenile, she would get only a minimal sentence in a youth 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Brown insisted in the interview with police that his discussions with 
his daughter had been purely hypothetical; he did not think she would go 
through with the plot, he said, terming it "a joke . . . a game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Shocked' 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked that Linda was actually shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at another point during the videotaped interview, Brown seemed to 
contradict that very assertion: "I told (Cinnamon that) if she was going to go 
through with this thing regardless of what I said, I didn't want to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was not in the house when Cinnamon Brown shot her stepmother as she 
slept, police said.

NEW MOVE TO RID HARBOR BLVD. OF PROSTITUTES ASSAILED, PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual legal ploy that has civil libertarians crying foul, Santa Ana 
police Tuesday night began handing out complaint citations to prostitutes and 
their clients who congregate on Harbor Boulevard, warning them that they now 
face more serious penalties if they do not leave. 
</P>
<P>
City officials earlier Tuesday had filed a lawsuit in Superior Court, asking 
that 350 convicted prostitutes and their "johns" be declared a public nuisance. 
If a judge approves an injunction, then any of the prostitutes notified by the 
police face more serious contempt charges if they return to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never been done before in California and maybe not anywhere else in the 
U.S.," said Terrence Patrick Grace, Santa Ana's deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Residents along Harbor Boulevard between Sunflower Avenue and Westminster 
Avenue applauded the city's move; civil libertarians immediately challenged it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a violation of constitutional rights to try and get people off the street 
merely for their criminal record and not for any present illegal conduct," said 
Rebecca Jurado, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She said people should not be arrested for their "mere presence" on a 
particular street. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for COYOTE, a prostitutes' rights organization based in San 
Francisco, called the Santa Ana plan "just another form of harassment" against 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The plan discriminates against women because more female prostitutes are likely 
to be arrested than male "johns," said Priscilla Alexander of the Call Off Your 
Old, Tired Ethics group. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper disagreed. "We're taking action to abate 
a public nuisance, and they'll have an opportunity to contest it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 8, when a Superior Court judge will 
decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction against prostitutes and their 
customers, ordering them to remain 100 yards from the area. 
</P>
<P>
If the injunction is issued, then cited prostitutes and "johns" who return -- 
even if for reasons other than buying or selling sex -- could be arrested for 
contempt and jailed. Grace said violation of the court order would be treated 
as a criminal matter, carrying more serious penalties than prostitution 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Grace said the city and police are asking the judge to assess 
monetary damages against those who would be arrested, including seizing cash 
that prostitutes often carry with them. Grace said some prostitutes are 
carrying $500 to $800 when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 p.m. Tuesday, police had arrested about a dozen suspected prostitutes and 
brought them into the South Harbor police substation, where they were 
fingerprinted, photographed, and given citations with a warning that they could 
face more serious charges if they return after an injunction is issued. 
</P>
<P>
One who was cited said she didn't think the new program would have much of an 
effect. "There's nothing you can do about it (prostitution along Harbor)," said 
a woman who gave her name only as Deborah. "It's always been there, it's always 
going to be there," said Deborah, who stands about 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 
was dressed in a green sweatshirt-minidress. " . . . I hope I'm out of here in 
20 minutes, I gotta go to work." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police said they were forced to come up with the approach because of 
a recent surge in prostitution in the area. 
</P>
<P>
According to the California attorney general's Bureau of Criminal Statistics, 
prostitution arrests in the county rose to 1,644 in 1987 from 1,524 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and business owners along Harbor Boulevard have complained that they 
find drug syringes and used condoms in the streets and are sometimes harassed 
by prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been propositioned a few times," said Bob Osborne, 68, who lives about 
three blocks away from the targeted area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the women and children I'm concerned about," he said. "And it doesn't 
help the property values either." 
</P>
<P>
While officials acknowledged that the effort may just move prostitutes to a new 
location, they said the problem has become particularly bad in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Garden Grove had discussed developing a similar plan in September.

CARTER SUED POLICE OVER SON'S ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 10 years ago, on an unusually warm winter night in 1978, attorney 
Brian R. Carter was recuperating from an illness in his Newport Beach home when 
the telephone rang. 
</P>
<P>
A Newport Beach police officer was calling to tell Carter and his wife that 
their 17-year-old son, Brian Carter Jr., had been arrested on suspicion of 
drunk driving. He could be released from the City Jail to his parents' custody, 
the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
When they picked him up, the Carters claimed, there were cuts and bruises on 
the youth's face. The younger Carter told his father that he had been roughed 
up by police officers -- kicked in the head and slammed against a patrol car 
holding cage -- after he had been questioned when he was found sitting in a car 
in the parking lot of Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Carter filed a $50,000 lawsuit against the police and the city of Newport 
Beach. After 4 years of litigation, another attorney eventually took the case 
to trial and lost. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, 1982, Brian R. Carter was named by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to 
the Harbor Municipal Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit Carter filed against Newport Beach and its Police Department is 
perceived by some as part of a longstanding strained relationship between law 
enforcement agencies and some Harbor Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert H. Polis, who was a judge at Harbor 
Court until 1982, said: "There's no question that there was a little bit of 
unhappiness between Brian Carter and the Newport Beach police before he became 
a judge. That's what was always rumbling in the community." 
</P>
<P>
But on balance, law enforcement sources say, Carter's lawsuit probably 
contributed only in small part to the feud. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Judge Carter denied that he harbors any animosity toward 
the police because of the lawsuit over his son's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"What's over is over," Carter said. "I am an impartial judge. There are no hard 
feelings on my part. I think the Newport Beach Police Department has some fine 
officers. They may have had an image problem in the past. But I think they are 
working hard at that."

LAWSUIT SETTLED, CLEARING WAY FOR IRVINE COAST PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
With a trial about to start Tuesday, attorneys for the Irvine Co. and the 
Laguna Conservancy reached a settlement that allows the county's biggest 
landowner to proceed with development of the Irvine Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring attorneys for the Laguna Conservancy sued in Superior Court to 
invalidate a bargain struck between the company and the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors that protects the company's 9,432-acre Irvine Coast project in 
return for company financing of new roads and public facilities, including a 
new sheriff's substation. 
</P>
<P>
The project includes three hotels and 2,600 housing units, with 76% of the land 
set aside as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's settlement is the latest in a series involving about 20 controversial 
development agreements approved by the supervisors. All but a few have been 
settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Still Pending 
</P>
<P>
Among the cases still pending is a separate lawsuit, scheduled for a court 
hearing next week, seeking to block the Irvine Co.'s controversial Laguna 
Laurel planned community near the north end of Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Conservancy claimed in the Irvine Coast lawsuit that the development 
agreement, approved last April, was intended to circumvent the countywide 
slow-growth ballot initiative then pending on the June 7 ballot. The measure 
was defeated, 56% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
But in the settlement reached Tuesday, the conservancy dropped its claim that 
such development agreements are unconstitutional because they bind future 
boards of supervisors to land-use policies approved by current board members. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement, the conservancy admitted that the development agreement is 
legally valid in return for extension of an offer by the Irvine Co. to sell two 
small parcels of flatland to Laguna Beach. The parcels, next to Laguna Canyon 
Road, are considered crucial to environmentalists seeking to preserve Laguna 
Canyon's rural character. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Questioned 
</P>
<P>
In court Tuesday morning, Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam sharply 
questioned conservancy lawyer Gregory A. Hile about whether his lawsuit had 
actually obtained any benefit for his client. Hile cited the Irvine Co.'s offer 
to sell the small land parcels to Laguna Beach, but later, outside of court, 
company officials said they had a previous agreement with city officials 
containing the same offer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's true," Hile said, "but the city hasn't acted on it yet, and the offer 
was set to expire in May." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement reached Tuesday, the Irvine Co. cannot revoke the sales 
offer for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city recently received 
about $10 million in state parkland money and hopes to use it in negotiating 
the purchase of these and other small parcels next to the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, the Irvine Co. agreed to pay Hile's law firm $6,250. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also provides that Caltrans can use the land, if necessary, for 
the planned widening of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Conservancy officials did not return The Times Orange County Edition's 
phone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appearance of Abuse' 
</P>
<P>
While praising the settlement, Gary Hunt, senior vice president of the Irvine 
Co., said the suit "represented an inescapable appearance of abuse of the legal 
system by the attorneys representing the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
"They have already settled the majority of lawsuits filed against development 
agreements and have gained approximately $150,000 in settlements, and for no 
apparent reason other than their own self-aggrandizement," Hunt said. "It has 
been a distasteful experience." 
</P>
<P>
Hile and his partner, Belinda Blacketer, have defended cash payments to them as 
necessary to defray the costs of filing and researching the lawsuits involved. 
However, slow-growth advocate Russ Burkett broke ranks with the lawyers last 
summer over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending are lawsuits involving the planned community of Aliso Viejo, in 
which a tentative settlement was reached last week, the planned expansion of 
Coto de Caza, Talega Valley, Bear Brand Ranch and Laguna Laurel.

SANTA CLARA'S WITHDRAWAL FROM TOURNAMENT TO BE DISCUSSED

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impact of Santa Clara High School's withdrawal on the South Coast Christmas 
basketball tournament will be discussed at a hearing Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section's Executive Committee -- Principal Tom Jacobson of Corona 
del Mar, Superintendent Bruce Keuning of the Bellflower Christian Schools, 
Superintendent Robert Packer of the Duarte Unified School District and 
Principal Gary Smidderks of Los Angeles Baptist -- will listen to testimony and 
make a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to appear at the hearing will be Lou Cvijanovich, Santa Clara 
basketball coach, Anne Metcalf, Santa Clara principal and Chuck and Art Perry, 
tournament directors. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, which had a written contract to participate in the 16-team 
tournament, failed to appear for a consolation-round game against Laguna Hills 
on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich made the decision not to appear after a 39-38 loss to Edison the 
previous day. Cvijanovich blamed the loss on the officiating, which he felt 
favored Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara forfeited two games by failing to appear for the remainder of the 
tournament, a violation of Rule 151.3 of the Southern Section rule book ("When 
a school fails to engage in a contest agreed upon, without giving notice to the 
other school and securing an honorable release, it may be suspended from 
membership.") 
</P>
<P>
"The committee met last weekend and reviewed statements that were submitted in 
writing and felt a hearing was necessary before taking action," said Dean 
Crowley, Southern Section associate commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee will listen to testimony in a closed hearing and then make a 
recommendation following its meeting on Feb. 16. Also at issue is the financial 
impact Santa Clara's withdrawal had on the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley said that he and Commissioner Stan Thomas would be at the meeting. TOM

BOWMAN IS OUSTED AS WESTMINSTER CO-COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westminster High School administrators asked Jack Bowman Tuesday to step down 
as co-coach of the football team, leaving Stan Clark as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to that decision at the end of football season, that we needed to 
return to a single head coach," Principal Robert Boehme said. "After the first 
of the year, I sat down with them and they both agreed." 
</P>
<P>
Boehme said the change was necessary because of "communication problems" caused 
by having two coaches. Two coaches creates a problem "because you have two 
different people speaking and sometimes you double the work and overlap the 
work or sometimes things are missed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boehme, Athletic Administrator Don Griffith and Assistant Principal Frank 
Paredes asked Bowman and Clark, who also is the boys' athletic director, to 
submit coaching plans for next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the coaching plan and interviews and the tons of intangibles, the 
unanimous decision of the committee was that Stan Clark would be the head 
coach," Boehme said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman declined to discuss the decision, but Clark said he doesn't expect 
Bowman to be a member of the staff next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack told me today he won't be back," Clark said. "He's hurt, and I feel bad 
about that. I would be upset if the decision had been the other way. I could 
see this coming, but the change was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how well you get along, communication becomes difficult with two 
coaches in charge. It's like having two captains on a ship. Jack and I agreed 
at the time to try one coach, I'm just sorry it worked out this way." 
</P>
<P>
. Bowman, who teaches history at Westminster, was an assistant football coach 
there for 13 years before becoming co-head coach in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In his 4 years as co-coach, Westminster compiled a 23-22-1 record, advancing to 
the playoffs each year.

CANADIAN OIL PRODUCERS EXPECT LESS ACTIVITY IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CALGARY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wary over the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
maintain its latest production accord, Canada's oil industry is expecting a 
sharp decline in activity this year. 
</P>
<P>
The president of one of Canada's largest petroleum companies says that most 
firms will play a waiting game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"No one believes OPEC will near its price target of $18 in the near term, and 
companies are setting their budgets based on cash flow from $14 to $15 oil," 
said the top executive who spoke on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies will survive at that level, but very few will make major 
expenditures they can't postpone. Basically everyone is going to retrench, keep 
themselves financially strong and wait for prices to recover," he said. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC has an agreement for the first 6 months of the year designed to reduce 
production and boost the world price of oil. But industry analysts are divided 
on whether the cartel can stop the excess production by members that has 
undermined previous similar accords. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum analysts say the one bright spot in the oil patch may be the sales of 
natural gas, with exports to the United States expected to match or exceed the 
record of 1.3 trillion cubic feet reached in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they say that gas prices, unlike oil prices, are believed to have 
bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts point out that Canadian domestic and export pipelines are 
nearing capacity, limiting the industry's ability to cash in on increased 
demand. Also, competition from fuel oil could limit potential gas price 
increases. 
</P>

The Canadian Petroleum Assn. has been predicting a 25% decline in industry 
capital expenditures. It also expects the number of wells drilled in 1989 to 
decline to about 6,000 from more than 8,500 in 1988.

<P>
Association Vice President Hans Maciej told Reuters that most companies 
probably will not revise their exploration budgets until they are confident 
that the OPEC pact will hold. 
</P>
<P>
"The test will come in the first quarter when we see what happens to the large 
oil inventory already out there," Maciej said. "Industry will take a 
wait-and-see attitude until then."

A small San Diego County bank has purchased Banker's Mortgage Service Corp. in 
Orange, a mortgage lender that has been funding up to $3.5 million in loans 
every month. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price paid by Rancho Vista National Bank was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
All nine employees at Banker's Mortgage, including owners Michael Hughes and 
Douglas McCracken, remained with the bank as part of its mortgage division. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken said the old staff, operating as a loan production office in the old 
Banker's Mortgage offices, is already expanding. It has hired two more 
employees and plans to hire three or four more this year. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert E. Slezinger, Rancho Vista's president, said in prepared remarks that 
the new unit will account for about 10% of the bank's total loan activity and 
will boost net income by up to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Vista's assets were $47.2 million at the end of 1988, and its net income 
for the year was $550,000. Slezinger, with 17 years of banking experience, was 
once president of the former Heritage Bank in Anaheim.

TOSHIBA EXECUTIVE RESIGNS TO LEAD SEIKO UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
REHFELD JOINS SHORT LIST OF AMERICANS RUNNING U.S. ARM OF A JAPANESE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Rehfeld has resigned as vice president and general manager of Toshiba 
America's Information Systems Division in Irvine to head operations of Seiko 
Instruments USA Inc., it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As president, chief operating officer and a board member of Seiko Instruments 
USA in Torrance, Rehfeld will become one of a small group of Americans to head 
the U.S. operations of a large Japanese firm. Seiko Instruments USA is a 
subsidiary of Seiko Instruments Inc. in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Rehfeld said he is joining Seiko effective Feb. 10 because it is a good career 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Organizationally, I've moved from being a division general manager to being 
president of a company with seven operating divisions," Rehfeld said. 
"Essentially, I'm doing the job my boss was doing at Toshiba." 
</P>
<P>
Seiko Instruments USA employs about 300 people and had 1988 sales of $130 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Rehfeld said his move to Seiko signals an expanding role in the company for 
U.S. executives, and added, "We'll do everything we can to attract and retain 
the best American management." 
</P>
<P>
Rehfeld is credited with steering Toshiba into a dominant position in the 
fast-growing market for so-called laptop computers -- small, lightweight 
machines that are easily carried by executives, salespeople and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The Seiko subsidiary hopes to broaden its product line in the area of consumer 
electronics, as well as high-resolution graphics and high-resolution computer 
printers, Rehfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Seiko Instrument USA's current president, Hiroshi Fukino, will become chairman 
of the board and chief executive officer of the subsidiary. Reinosuke Hara, 
current chairman of the board, is stepping down from that post but will 
continue as president of Seiko Instruments Inc. in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At Toshiba America's Information Systems Division, Mark Tanaka, assistant 
general manager for personal computers, will immediately assume the position of 
interim general manager of the division, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Information Systems Division employs about 450 people and expects sales for 
fiscal 1988 ending March 31 to total about $450 million from the manufacture of 
personal computers and printers. It is a unit of Japanese electronics giant 
Toshiba Corp.

SPENCER WILLIAMS' BEHIND-THE-CAMERA WORK DESERVES ANOTHER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID STERRITT, The Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who watched American television during the 1950s knew Spencer Williams' 
face. He was known in households everywhere for his weekly portrayal of Andy, 
the silliest of all the silly characters on "Amos 'n' Andy," a popular comedy 
series with an all-black cast. 
</P>
<P>
But there was something most viewers didn't know: Just a few years earlier, 
Williams had been a full-fledged film maker in his own right. Before achieving 
his TV fame, he directed, wrote and performed in a string of movies aimed at 
black audiences and grounded in the folk traditions of rural Southerners. 
</P>
<P>
After being overlooked for decades, this unique body of work has now been 
placed in a much-deserved spotlight by the Whitney Museum of American Art, 
which featured six Williams movies in its New American Film and Video Series 
recently. Williams, who died in 1969, is hardly a "new" film maker. But his 
work is as American as anything could be, and the museum -- which takes a 
frequent interest in the byways of African-American cinema -- has earned thanks 
for bringing it renewed attention. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had a remarkable career. As a young man in Hollywood during the early 
years of sound film, he parlayed his knowledge of black folkways into a job 
with a major studio, where he worked on black-targeted "race movies" and other 
low-budget programming. But his real ambition was to make pictures based on the 
traditions he knew from his own rural Louisiana background. His big chance came 
in 1941, when he directed and acted in "The Blood of Jesus," an astonishing 
50-minute melodrama about a woman who has visions of heaven, hell, and her 
future life after being gravely wounded by her husband in a shooting accident. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing remotely slick or sophisticated about this movie, which (like 
all the Williams films I've seen) has rough-hewn performances, editing, and 
camera work. Such technical drawbacks seem unimportant, though, in light of the 
moral passion and visual creativity that mark the picture. While its cinematic 
qualities are unpolished, they allow for a directness of expression and a 
purity of atmosphere that have few equivalents in Hollywood or anywhere else. 
Just as important, the performances bypass Hollywood-style realism in favor of 
a ritual quality that recalls the traditions of Southern black churches -- just 
as some of the most powerful and complex American jazz has deep roots in the 
heritage of gospel and church-choir music. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Whitney guest curator Adrienne Lanier Seward, who assembled the 
Williams programs, that "The Blood of Jesus" marks the high point of Williams' 
film career. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Down Death," a 1944 drama about a righteous preacher framed by a 
sin-promoting villain, tries for a similar visionary style -- complete with 
gauzy visions of the afterlife -- to less compelling effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Of One Blood," the moralistic story of brothers separated by the accidents of 
life, draws much of its interest from Williams' inability to cope with special 
effects (there's an unwittingly hilarious dam-breaking scene) or to coax 
conventionally realistic performances from his cast. 
</P>
<P>
There's hidden gold in Williams movies that don't try so hard to be 
inspirational, though. "Dirty Gertie From Harlem USA," made in 1946, recalls W. 
Somerset Maugham's deftly written "Rain" (and "Sadie Thompson," its most famous 
film version) in its story of a loose-living woman caught between a preacher 
and a sailor on a provincial island. "The Girl in Room 20," also from 1946, 
does its moralizing in a setting that's more commonplace and more convincing. 
</P>
<P>
The 1947 comedy "Juke Joint," meanwhile, is genuinely comical but in an ironic 
way: Its humor, especially when Williams himself is on the screen, strongly 
recalls the humor of "Amos 'n' Andy" on TV a decade later. The irony is that 
"Amos 'n' Andy," made by whites even though it featured black performers, was 
eventually attacked and removed from circulation on the ground that it promoted 
racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
I think there was a good case for taking "Amos 'n' Andy" off the air at a time 
when blacks were fighting a hard (and still unfinished) battle against bigotry. 
But it's interesting to see nearly identical humor in slightly earlier films 
that were made by blacks for specifically black audiences, possibly testimony 
to the limits on black freedom or the black self-image. It's also enlightening 
to see those movies in the context of Williams' brief but distinctive career. 
Like no other film maker, he overcame the limitations of restricted resources 
to make a body of work that represents a proud and unmistakable alternative to 
the Hollywood and TV establishments. 
</P>
<P>
The New American Film and Video Series continues at the Whitney with "AIDS 
Media: Counter-Representations," a varied program on the AIDS crisis. Later 
this season the museum will present work by Yoko Ono. Springtime will bring the 
important Whitney Biennial Selection of ground-breaking film and video works.

COUNTRY SINGER JANN BROWNE GETS A SHOT AT BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY GLEASON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's late afternoon at the Palomino, the North Hollywood cowboy bar that has 
played host to everyone from Waylon Jennings and Marty Robbins to an 
early-model Linda Ronstadt, and Jann Browne is waiting for Rosie Flores to 
finish her sound-check. Waiting is something the country singer from Mission 
Viejo is good at because it's something she's been doing for the last 15 years. 
But now Browne is about to get her shot at the big time. 
</P>
<P>
After being around the Orange County club scene and having sung with Asleep at 
the Wheel for almost 2 years, Browne finally has a record contract. She has 
signed with Curb Records, a Santa Monica-based affiliate of MCA Records that is 
home to such talent as the Judds, the Desert Rose Band and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
Daylight doesn't become the Palomino. The giant pictures on the wall seem 
harsh; the performers they show look anything but happy. But Browne is smiling, 
swinging her feet in time to Flores' music and making small talk about her 
grandparents, who introduced her to country music when she was a child in 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to clog and square dance on the Opry, and I remember standing in the 
wings watching them. It was so amazing to me, the music and the way they moved 
around," Browne recalls. "In fact, it's always been one of my regrets that I 
never learned to dance like they did." 
</P>
<P>
Still, hanging around the honky tonks, one can't help but pick up a few steps 
-- like the sidestep, which has proven especially useful to Browne in 
deflecting record biz requests for slick country-pop tunes. Browne has nothing 
in common with, say, fellow Hoosier Janie Fricke, the former jingle singer 
whose brand of country is slicker than a duck tail on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I've got nothing against (that type of singer)," Browne said, "but 
what they're doing really isn't country. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Browne is country. She can discuss Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and just about any 
other old-line country singer at length -- and she often draws from their 
catalogues when fleshing out her own set list. To this 34-year old, keeping 
country's classics alive is as important as getting her own songs to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd pretty much resigned myself to playing the bars around Orange County, 
where people still appreciate the hard stuff, because I just could never bring 
myself to singing a lot of the stuff I was hearing on the radio a few years 
ago," Browne said with a sigh. "And even when (more traditional country singers 
such as) Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam started happening, you didn't see a lot 
of women rushing out and doing that. Why, even Emmylou Harris seemed to be 
having a hard time with radio." 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise that Harris is a big Jann Browne fan. "There's something about 
the way she sings that is so pure and so honest," Harris said last year when 
Browne opened for her at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. "And her 
writing is wonderful. 'Mexican Wind' is a No. 1 song if I've ever heard one." 
</P>
<P>
A low, longing ballad about love and betrayal on the border, "Mexican Wind" is 
the kind of song that could bring the Western back to C&amp;W. "Louisville," 
another Browne original (featured on Enigma Records' "Town South of Bakersfield 
Two" compilation album) was named Country Song of the Year by the California 
Country Music Assn. -- which also named Browne Female Entertainer of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Browne's first Curb single, "You Ain't Down Home," written by Jamie O'Hara of 
the O'Kanes, is scheduled for a February release. Produced by Steve Fishell, 
the steel player in Harris' Hot Band, it's about a woman who isn't afraid to 
stand up for herself as she tells a would-be suitor that his money's all well 
and good, but it's not what matters to her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of song I can relate to," Browne said, "not only on the obvious 
level of money not making the man, but because it's got a lot to do with my 
whole attitude about country music and where it's at, what's going on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hopes are high for the record, but Browne's not buying her palatial Nashville 
estate just yet. "I don't know," she allowed, laughing. "This is such a risky 
business and you just never know. I mean, I always thought I'd get my shot but 
. . . who knows what'll happen? 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I don't think I'd ever want to leave California. This is my home, and 
with all the country music that's coming out of here, I think I'd just as soon 
buy some property on the ocean and stick around."

SISTERLY SHOW OFFERS TASTE OF JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When state Sen. John Seymour was mayor of Anaheim from 1978 to 1982, his 
political counterpart in Mito, Japan, gave him the perfect accessory for 
political battle: a full-size replica of samurai armor complete with 
fierce-looking helmet and faceplate. 
</P>
<P>
The armor, along with dozens of pieces of Japanese art and memorabilia, is on 
public display in the Anaheim Museum's "Mito: Anaheim's Sister City," an 
eclectic mix of upscale souvenirs and bona fide treasures given to members of 
Anaheim's Sister City Committee by Mito delegates since the two cities became 
linked 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinated by Herbert E. Pruett, museum director, and June Lowry, Anaheim 
Sister City Committee president, the exhibit continues through April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Located 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, Mito has a lengthy history, to say the 
least: Archeological findings in the area date to the Stone Age. Its rulers 
included members of the Yamato Clan in about AD 500 and the Tokugawa Clan in 
the early 1600s. Mito City was established formally in 1889, suffered heavy 
damages in a World War II air raid in 1945 and today has a population of more 
than 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim/Mito relationship started to develop in the '70s when a member of 
the Mito City Council had a brother who lived in Anaheim. Correspondence 
between the communities revealed that they were similar in size and that each 
ranked education as a priority. The link became official in December of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Among the results of sister cityhood: an annual exchange of delegates that 
Lowry says "let's us get to know each other on a one-to-one basis . . . and 
understand not only each other's culture but why we think and react in 
different ways." 
</P>
<P>
The opening of "Mito: Anaheim's Sister City" in November dovetailed with the 
arrival of the 1988 delegation from Mito, which included Mayor Kazunobu Sagawa, 
businessman/philanthropist Yuichi Hataya and local citizens. Hataya, chairman 
of Mito's Sister City program, donated $50,000 to the Anaheim Museum in October 
and has pledged an additional $50,000 to be paid over the next 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
The strong Japanese tradition of gift giving is also shown in the exhibit 
itself -- items range from a luxurious wedding kimono and a delicate hakata 
doll to handmade ceramic plates and ceremonial lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
The samurai armor is one of the most impressive pieces in the show; it is 
composed of hundreds of tiny, decorated metal plates laid over heavy amber and 
orange brocade. Broad, armored epaulets protect the shoulders. The faceplate 
sports an evil grimace and (in case the wearer is lacking his own) a dark, 
sinister-looking mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"The samurai is a warrior, similar to the knights of medieval times," Lowry 
explained. "They fight for the shogun, who you might compare to a lord. In 
Mito, you can still see one of the original shogun summer palaces." The armor 
featured in the exhibit, made as a collectible item, is typical of the kind 
worn by samurai during the feudal period, Lorsy said. 
</P>
<P>
Displayed against a stark black wall in the gallery is the traditional wedding 
kimono, with shimmering red, green and yellow flowers on a quilted, emerald 
satin background. A large hanayome ningyo, or bridal doll, depicts the complete 
nuptial outfit topped off by the white, boxlike tauno kakushi headpiece, which, 
according to Japanese custom, serves as a hiding place for a woman's jealousy 
during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Dolls enjoy an elevated status in Japan, and those displayed at the Mito show 
constitute something of a primer in Japanese art and culture. They include the 
contemporary clay hakata child-doll (a style designated in 1976 by the Japanese 
government as a national art); several colorful "paddle board" or "flat" dolls, 
commonly carried in parades or celebrations, and a graceful porcelain-faced 
geisha. 
</P>
<P>
"The geisha is different from what most people think," Lowry said. "She is a 
hostess and entertainer, not . . . a prostitute. A geisha would typically 
entertain at a dinner, dancing or singing or playing musical instruments, but 
that's as far as it goes. It's a great honor to be a geisha and requires years 
of special training." 
</P>
<P>
Traditional Japanese theater is also represented. A ceremonial kite and a silk 
wall hanging depict costumed Kabuki actors in scenes from traditional noh 
plays, and a couple of chubby-cheeked noh masks smile smugly on a back wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Only men may become Kabuki," Lowry said. "It's a highly prestigious position, 
and in order to become well-known, you actually have to apprentice to another 
successful actor. An established Kabuki will portray the same characters for 
years, and when he retires he hands down that role to a selected person." 
</P>
<P>
Other items in the show include a delicate ceremonial tea set, decorative fans, 
miniature samurai helmets, hand-carved wood statuettes and a tiny lacquerware 
reproduction of a gyusha, an ox-drawn cart used during the Heian Period (AD 785 
to 1185) to carry members of the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mito: Anaheim's Sister City" continues through April 16 at the Anaheim 
Museum, 241 S. Anaheim Blvd. Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through 
Fridays, noon to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Admission is free, but a $1.50 
donation from adults is suggested. Information: (714) 778-3301.

JEERS CAUSE RABIN TO WALK OUT ON PARLIAMENT DEBATE

Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin walked out of a stormy Parliament debate today 
after opposition members heckled him about increased bloodshed in the occupied 
territories and demanded he resign. 
</P>
<P>
Eight small parties tried to bring down the government with a series of 
no-confidence motions, but legislators of the broad national unity government 
voted them down. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition reflected growing unease many Israelis feel about the army's 
handling of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
There also is frustration because the army has not been able to squelch the 
13-month revolt, which does not appear to be flagging. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet, meanwhile, met behind closed doors for a briefing on tougher army 
policies that include destroying the houses of suspected stone-throwers and 
liberalizing shooting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin, who stopped his speech at least a dozen times because of raucous 
shouting, left the podium after about half an hour and refused to complete his 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I propose the government reject these no-confidence motions," he said quietly 
before leaving the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was over the high number of Palestinian deaths in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Palestinians have been killed in the last week, and critics have 
blamed the army's increasing use of plastic bullets and newly introduced 
rubber-coated metal pellets for many of the casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said that as long as Palestinians stage violent protests, the tougher 
army policies will stand. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they say, 'We will continue with violence,' their violence will be 
met with force," he said. "What is Israel to do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Talk peace!" shouted one Arab member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of the territories!" shouted another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Brain of Lead' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a government with a plastic heart, a brain of lead and a conscience of 
rubber," said Mohammad Miari of the Progressive List for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said residents of the occupied territories refuse to abandon support for 
the Palestine Liberation Organization and instead talk peace directly with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to talk with the PLO, which it considers a terrorist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"What does all that have to do with killing children, with the daily slaughter 
in the territories?" shouted Tewfik Toubi, an Arab member of the Israel 
Communist Party.

A leading challenger in Los Angeles' 5th City Council District race, Steve 
Saltzman, unexpectedly dropped out today and endorsed incumbent Los Angeles 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>

Saltzman's departure follows the surprise entry of his former campaign 
consultant, Jack McGrath, into the race last weekend. Laura Lake, a UCLA 
professor and slow-growth activist, is considered the strongest remaining 
challenger to Yaroslavsky, who is seeking reelection. The election is April 11.

KILLER OF 5 A 'NORMAL STUDENT'

Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school 
playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a 
student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation's significance was not immediately clear, although it appeared 
to suggest that the attack at Cleveland Elementary was not altogether random. 
Police officials said they still had not determined what set off Purdy, a 
troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
The midday attack, which lasted only minutes, ended when Purdy mortally wounded 
himself in the head with a pistol, leaving his motive unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why, and I probably won't ever know why," said Purdy's 
grandmother, 63-year-old Julia Chumbley, who lives nearby in Lodi. Other 
relatives described Purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced 
across America, looking for work as a welder. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Elementary was in session today, although only a little more than 200 
pupils -- roughly one-fourth of the student body -- showed up for classes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did attend were greeted at the school by escorts who guided them 
through a thicket of reporters and cameras. Counselors were stationed in each 
classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the previous 
day. Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's office. Teachers 
said they did not know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just try to get through the day," said Vicki Braga, who teaches fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
The front entrance of the school was decorated with bouquets of yellow 
gladioli, purple mums and five red roses. Someone also had placed there a pink 
teddy bear with angel's wings. A banner stretched across the front said 
"Racists are ugly -- let's stop them." 
</P>
<P>
The banner's message enunciated an early suspicion that the racial composition 
of the student body might have contributed to Purdy's motivation. More than 600 
of the 980 students are the sons and daughters of refugees from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Police, however, said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he had some feelings against the Southeast Asian community as a whole, 
we haven't determined that," said Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had not yet determined if any teachers at Cleveland Elementary 
were there when Purdy was in attendance from 1969 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
His record at the school showed "normal behavior," officials said. He 
transferred out in the third grade to a school in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators last night searched the Lodi motel room where Purdy had 
been staying. He had checked in the day after Christmas, and was paid up 
through Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
They found more than 100 plastic toy soldiers arrayed about the room, along 
with toy jeeps and tanks, in what appeared to be a imaginary battle scene. 
</P>
<P>
"What the significance is, I don't know," Perry said. "He obviously had a 
military hang-up of some kind."

HUD Secretary-designate Jack Kemp told big-city mayors today that he will be an 
activist and an advocate for solving housing and other urban problems, calling 
himself "a big-L liberal" and "a bleeding heart conservative" on urban issues. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors, cited the problems posed by 
federal budget constraints but spoke enthusiastically about working with the 
mayors, whose complaints about cuts in federal aid to cities at a time when the 
number of homeless has been growing have been a constant refrain during the 
Reagan years.

"I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out ideology," said

The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose in December to 
its highest since November, 1979, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.1 
percentage point to 84.2% last month, the highest rate since 84.3% in November, 
1979. As capacity use edges toward 85%, economists fear factories will have 
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price 
increases.

The director of the Oregon Department of Corrections was found dead early today 
near his office, and authorities are investigating the case as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Michael Francke, 42, was discovered shortly after midnight by a 
security guard on a routine check at the Corrections Department building, which 
is located on the grounds of Oregon State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt said the body was identified as that 
of Francke, and state police said there was "evidence of violence in the cause 
of death." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half a Mile From Penitentiary 
</P>
<P>
Police on the scene appeared to be searching the area between the entrance to 
the building and the parking lot. The office is about half a mile from Oregon 
State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Francke was named director of the state corrections program in May, 1987, by 
Goldschmidt. Francke was the former head of the New Mexico corrections system 
from 1983 to January, 1987, and served as a district judge in Santa Fe and Los 
Alamos, N.M., and as an assistant deputy attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
While in Oregon, Francke was Goldschmidt's point man in trying to resolve 
Oregon's crowded prison problem, which has been blamed for the state's 
reputation as a high-crime state. 
</P>
<P>
Francke was born in Kansas City, Mo., was a Navy lieutenant and a graduate of 
the University of Virginia Law School.

Two cosmonauts who spent a year in space suffered fewer physical effects than

Soviet space specialists said today.

"Longer flights, we believe, are quite possible, and we think they will be

Problems of the Soviet Health Ministry, told a news conference. Grigoryev said 
cosmonauts Musa Manarov and Vladimir Titov, who returned to Earth on Dec. 21, 
suffered some atrophy of their calf muscles and some loss of calcium, as have 
other cosmonauts, but an exercise and training program lessened the effects.

SEC PRESSING DREXEL TO MOVE BEVERLY HILLS DIVISION TO NEW YORK

The Securities and Exchange Commission wants Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to 
move its lucrative "junk bond" division from Beverly Hills to New York as a 
condition for settling a massive fraud complaint against the firm, sources 
familiar with their negotiations said today. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an account in the 
Wall Street Journal that said SEC negotiators made the demand in talks late 
last week, toughening an earlier request that Drexel move only its supervision 
authority over the division to the firm's New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The new condition is important because Drexel must settle with the SEC as part 
of a broader plea bargain deal reached Dec. 21 with the Manhattan U.S. 
attorney's office. Under that deal, the firm will plead guilty to six fraud 
felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's high-yield "junk bond" division is considered the firm's most 
profitable operation. Dismantling and moving it to New York could cripple 
Drexel's renowned prowess in the $175-billion market for junk bonds, commonly 
used to finance takeovers and the growth of small and mid-size companies. 
</P>
<P>
The new SEC demand occurred at a time when many Drexel high-yield bond traders 
already are upset over the firm's decision to reach a plea bargain with the 
government rather than fight longstanding charges of securities fraud that grew 
out of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the SEC negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the firm "does not believe the high-yield bond department can be 
successfully moved to New York, since any effort to do so would destroy the 
department and do irreparable damage to the high-yield market." 
</P>
<P>
SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the Drexel negotiations. The 
agency's policy is to refrain from commenting on any impending enforcement 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The high-yield department was moved from New York to California in 1978 by its 
architect, Michael Milken, a senior Drexel financier who is expected to be 
indicted on securities fraud and other charges.

JAPAN DECEMBER TRADE SURPLUS SETS A RECORD

<P>
Japan said today that its December trade surplus rose to $9.65 billion, the 
highest monthly level ever, from $8.61 billion a year ago on an unadjusted 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, the deficit fell slightly to $77.39 billion from $79.70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Both exports and imports grew at just slightly more than 11% in December from a 
year earlier, the government said. The monthly deficit on an adjusted basis 
fell to $7.10 billion from $7.63 billion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Economists generally expected the large December jump because worldwide demand 
for electrical and general machinery to tool up factories has been strong. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the full-year figures were generally disappointing. "These 
figures hide the reversal in the real trend in a way," said economist Kenneth 
Courtis of DB Capital Markets (Asia) Ltd. Most of 1988's reduction was 
accomplished in the first part of the year, and now the monthly surpluses are 
on the rise, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until June when the new export boom began," Courtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan tried to put a brave face on the figures, with the government forecasting 
a further fall in the trade surplus in the fiscal year beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the right track and will continue to be so in the coming year," said 
Mitoji Yabunaka, a director at the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop Expected 
</P>
<P>
The government expects its trade surplus to drop to $88 billion from $93 
billion in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast figures are not directly comparable to those released today for 
the 1988 calendar year because they are calculated on a different basis, which 
tends to push up the value of exports and inflate the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the export boom has been mainly to countries and regions other 
than the United States. In the past, most exports went to the United States.

The Pittsburgh Pirates said today they reached contract terms with third 
baseman Bobby Bonilla for the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, 25, a .274 batter in 1988, is the first to sign of eight players who 
filed for arbitration Monday prior to the noon deadline. Two others who would 
have been eligible for arbitration, pitcher Brian Fisher and outfielder R. J. 
Reynolds, agreed to terms and avoided filing. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla was named to the National League All-Star squad as the Pirates starting 
third basemen. He tied Pirates center fielder Andy Van Slyke for third in the 
league with 100 runs batted in, and he tied for fourth with 63 extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
He was the National League Player of the Month in April, when he had a .341 
batting average with seven home runs and 18 RBI, and in May, when he was .344 
with six homers and 25 RBI.

A Monaco body builder has been suspended for one year after testing positive 
for steroids in a Singapore competition, an official of the International 
Federation of Body Builders (IFBB) said today. 
</P>
<P>
Seggiaro Philippe, 20, was also stripped of his bronze medal in the World 
Junior/Masters Championship after results of urine tests taken during the 
competition last month and analyzed in West Germany were received recently by 
the IFBB, federation executive board member Paul Chua said. 
</P>
<P>
"Philippe only admits now he took steroids six months ago on medical grounds. 
If he had admitted it sooner, we might have considered the case differently," 
said Chua, who is also president of the Singapore Amateur Body Builders' 
Federation.
