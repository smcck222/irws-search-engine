The allure of public service is something that Ed Avila, a member of the Los 
Angeles Board of Public Works for the past five years, can't resist. "I never 
seem to have a choice about it," joked Avila, 46, who relishes his government 
career that started 20 years ago with Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has named Avila a deputy mayor, succeeding Grace Montanez 
Davis. Bradley wants Avila to advise him on Latinos, homelessness, public 
improvements and other issues. Avila has run unsuccessfully for L.A. City 
Council, helped found the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed 
Officials and served in the Carter Administration.

* First, it was "from the classroom and the newsroom to the conference room" 
for Felix Gutierrez. "Now, it's to the board room," said the Eastside native. 
Six months after he was appointed the first dean of academic services at USC's 
College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, Gutierrez has been named a vice 
president for the Gannett Foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropic 
entities. Although Gutierrez, 46, is moving to Arlington, Va., the journalism 
professor will still be focusing on journalism education and 
professionalization. 
</P>
<P>
* "I was interested to see what medicine was all about" is how Diana Larralde 
describes her love affair with health-care issues in East Los Angeles. From a 
1979 fund-raising dinner, Larralde got hooked on La Clinica Familiar del 
Barrio. Working her way through a variety of volunteer jobs, and titles, the 
35-year-old attorney now chairs the clinic's governing board, currently known 
as the AltaMed Health Service Corp. She said the $5-million operation, which is 
building a new senior citizens center, is important because so few are designed 
to serve Latinos. GEORGE RAMOS

SUFFERING TRAILS SALVADORANS WHO FLED CIVIL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA BARCELONA, Barcelona is a Los Angeles-based free-lance journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bomb blast that destroyed the family's home in San Salvador killed Gonzalo 
Fernandez's sister, nephew and three nieces. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rather sad because there is nothing I can do. I have trouble sleeping," 
said Fernandez, 40, who works in a Los Angeles picture frame factory. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody incident took place recently during the offensive launched against 
the Salvadoran armed forces by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, 
the rebel army known by its Spanish acronym, FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran army's bomb that killed his relatives exploded in the eastern 
San Salvadoran suburb of Soyapango, Fernandez said. The former customs police 
agent in El Salvador has requested political asylum in the United States. He 
has no relatives in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive has proven to be the bloodiest of the civil war clashes, which 
have claimed more than 70,000 lives since 1979 in that impoverished Central 
American nation. 
</P>
<P>
The news reaching Los Angeles of the turbulent Salvadoran situation has alarmed 
many refugees, such as Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"(The community) lives in a state of uncertainty and instability," said Jesus 
Aguilar, leader of Crecen, a Central American refugee committee. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Salvadoran immigrants seeking U.S. refuge from abject poverty 
or political persecution live outside the law, behind the language barrier and 
in constant dread of the prospect of arrest and deportation. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 350,000 Salvadorans live in the Los Angeles area, making them 
(next to Mexicans) the area's second-largest Latino nationality group. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the Salvadorans arrived here after 1981, too late to qualify 
for the federal alien amnesty program, which has benefited immigrants from 
other Latin American countries, according to Linton Joaquin, an attorney for 
the Central American Refugee Center, known as Carecen. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel imprisoned in the U.S., first of all because we are not given work 
permits, (and) we are being persecuted by the immigration laws," said Reynaldo 
Carbajal, a 43-year-old former stevedore who fled from the armed conflict last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of Salvadorans' being granted political asylum in this country are 
almost non-existent, said Richard Petherbridge, the attorney handling 
Fernandez's case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to get evidence to prove your case. . . . When you leave, 
you're fleeing under a lot of duress," Petherbridge said. "(You) have a very 
short period to leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
Although Fernandez tells of being detained and tortured by the army, his 
attorney says he has no scars to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a lack of hard proof, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service approves only 3% of the applications for asylum from Salvadorans, said 
Duke Austin, an INS spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Austin explained the INS policy this way: "To my knowledge . . . there has not 
been a war in El Salvador since 1980." Therefore, the INS considers these 
immigrants to be economic refugees who are not legally eligible to remain in 
this country. It is "not the INS that's insensitive," Austin said, adding that 
it is up to Congress to clarify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But referring to the latest rebel offensive, Aguilar said, "Who can now say 
that Salvadorans are economic refugees . . . when there are thousands of 
deaths?" 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN offensive has increased the interest in Congress in addressing the 
issue of Salvadoran refugees. "I believe they are political refugees," Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said. 
</P>
<P>
A bill suspending deportations of Salvadorans, along with Nicaraguans and 
Chinese, for three years has been approved by the House. The bill's fate in the 
Senate is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"The recent acts in El Salvador show that our policies have failed there," 
Pelosi said. "Until we promote peace and justice in El Salvador, I believe the 
migration will continue. We owe them the refuge of our country." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of returning, coupled with the lack of means to visit relatives back 
home, compels many Salvadoran workers in the United States to send them money. 
Almost $1 million in family assistance arrives daily in El Salvador from the 
United States, according to Jose Trinidad, a Los Angeles correspondent for a 
Salvadoran television station. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Salvadorans (there) survive with the daily help they receive from 
Salvadorans living here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Perez (who requested that her real name not be published) sends $200 a 
month for her three children and her six siblings who live with Perez's mother 
in San Salvador. In other cases, whole families have been able to immigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Having been able to do so brought great relief to the anguish Lidia Ayala de 
Rivas felt when she left her home in the outskirts of San Vicente in northern 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas' youngest daughter was 20 months old when the father, mother, six 
children and maternal grandmother set out on their journey across mountains and 
rivers in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The families I have interviewed who came over together are the closest knit I 
have ever known," said attorney Peter Schey, who heads the National Center for 
Immigrants' Rights in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No one could have foreseen the exodus of Salvadorans that has taken place since 
the civil war broke out 10 years ago. Such an idea was unimaginable when 
Benjamin Martinez arrived in the United States 36 years ago. Martinez, who owns 
a small print shop in the Pico Union area, said that in the past, "when we met 
a Salvadoran, we celebrated." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed and Pico Union, known as Little Central America, has about 
500 restaurants or pupuserias where Salvadoran dishes are served, said Sara 
Martinez of the Chirino Amaya Refugee Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Other small businessmen, such as Benjamin Martinez, have set up everything from 
parcel shipping offices to automotive repair shops, liquor stores and swap meet 
stands. Salvadorans are very enterprising, said Francisco Rivera, one of the 
organizers for the Central American Independence Parade last year. 
</P>
<P>
Many Salvadorans joined others from the region for the celebration in Little 
Central America last Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Martinez of the Chirino Amaya Committee added that there are not enough 
support systems for these immigrants and "giving them guidance becomes quite 
difficult." It is a complex issue, according to various community leaders, 
because of the scarcity of organizations that provide free social, medical and 
legal services for undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The situation could change if Salvadorans and other undocumented Latinos have 
the opportunity for self-improvement through education, Sara Martinez said. She 
added that "granting you refugee status gives you access to education and 
health" services. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who have been a teacher in El Salvador or a student and comes 
here to wash dishes," she said. "They are 'potentials' that, given different 
opportunities, could develop." 
</P>
<P>
Although besieged by everyday problems, the Salvadoran community seeks out 
spiritual celebrations and enrichment. It is common for churches to hold 
religious ceremonies at almost any hour, as well as folkloric dance classes, 
percussion music groups and cultural programs presenting native Salvadoran 
music, Sara Martinez added.

GANGS GET BOOST FROM NEW BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The messages that Juvenile Court official David Flores reads these days in the 
graffiti and gang slogans scrawled on East Los Angeles alleyways, homes and 
businesses are more disturbing than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I see new gang names showing up on the walls, and placas (logos) indicating 
that old, formerly quiet gangs are joining forces with younger groups and 
becoming active again," said Flores, administrator of Los Angeles County 
Juvenile Court schools. "It's very depressing." 
</P>
<P>
The trend is also seen in crime statistics showing that gang murders are on the 
rise in some communities east of the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
In the unincorporated area of East Los Angeles, for example, gang murders rose 
from none in 1988 to 11 in 1989. Similarly, the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Hollenbeck Division, which includes the community of Boyle Heights, reported 10 
gang murders in 1988, compared with 20 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing about it is that many of the new groups are composed of very 
young boys, 10 to 14 years of age, who are trying to make a reputation for 
themselves," Flores said. "I think we are entering a potentially violent period 
in East Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers to the gang violence that has returned to East Los 
Angeles after two years of relative peace. But interviews with law enforcement 
officials, gang experts, concerned parents, educators and gang members suggest 
that old-line veteranos -- imprisoned since police crackdowns in the late 1970s 
and early '80s -- are returning to the streets as ex-convicts determined to 
revive gangs that had dwindled to a handful of members. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys that come out of prison . . . have a reputation in the neighborhoods 
they came from," said Fred Martinez of the California Youth Authority's gang 
information services unit. "They also have the palabra (authoritative word) and 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
One of the best examples is the Geraghty Lomas gang. Its membership was gutted 
by drug overdoses, gang murders and heavy prison sentences, and only about 15 
aging Geraghty Lomas veteranos were left to claim their hilltop City Terrace 
barrio. 
</P>
<P>
As their power ebbed away, a new group of mostly nonviolent but raucous 
youngsters calling themselves Rockwood Stoners emerged in the area. These 
newcomers wore their hair long, listened to heavy-metal music and partied with 
people who did not respect neighborhood boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Disturbed by what they saw as a breakdown of the neighborhood and the gang 
codes they lived by, Geraghty Lomas began courting the younger Stoners, who 
numbered close to 100. In October, the gangs voted to merge into a new gang 
called Geraghty Lomas/Rockwood. 
</P>
<P>
The new, more potent gang, authorities say, is now at war with many of its 
combined list of 49 enemy gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got them up again, that's what they wanted," added another gang member, 16. 
"They (Geraghty Lomas veteranos) gave us guns, and we started taking care of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Geraghty Lomas/Rockwood is only one of a growing number of East Side gangs to 
have propped itself up in the past year with new recruits of Stoners and 
impressionable youths. Others include El Hoyo, Barrio Nuevo and even White 
Fence, one of the oldest Latino gangs in the city, authorities said. 
Separately, some groups of Stoners have cut their locks and traded in their 
heavy-metal garb for traditional cholo dress of oversize Pendleton shirts, 
khaki pants and short-cropped hair combed straight back with gel. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is "they're back to killing themselves for dirt (territorial 
boundaries), and that's really sad," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Joe 
Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
Only a mile northwest of the East Los Angeles sheriff's station, Patrick 
Vasquez, 30, whose 20-year-old brother was killed in a gang fight a decade ago, 
lamented the fact that "they (gang members) don't think about what the mothers, 
the wives and children are going through. 
</P>
<P>
"Every morning I tie my shoes and wonder if I'll be untying them at night or if 
the coroner will be untying them for me," Vasquez said. "A lot of these kids 
think it is all fun and games." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the decline in gang murder rates in unincorporated East Los Angeles -- 
the birthplace of Latino gangs -- from 22 in 1980 to zero in 1988 led some gang 
experts to believe that gang warfare there was a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The decline, which was preceded by a concerted anti-gang effort involving local 
parents and churches, the Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles Police 
Department, the California Youth Authority and the Community Youth Gang 
Services Project, prompted some agencies to switch funding and resources to 
other parts of the city that seemed to need them more. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of parents and teachers living and working in East Los Angeles 
neighborhoods that had been peaceful for years now want those resources back. 
</P>
<P>
At Stevenson Junior High School, for example, Principal Edward Amarillas said 
at least 5% of the student body of 2,550 students is involved with an estimated 
seven gangs from the local area. "Two years ago, it was half that percentage," 
Amarillas said. 
</P>
<P>
Principals from six junior high schools in the area met at the school 
district's regional headquarters in Boyle Heights to discuss the worsening 
problem of gangs and their growing influence on children. The principals 
discussed setting up new sports and other after-school activities for students. 
</P>
<P>
A group of concerned parents called a news conference in November to demand 
that county officials strengthen existing gang prevention services in their 
area. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference held at Soledad Enrichment Action, a social services 
organization funded by Catholic Charities, the group of about 20 mothers also 
called for additional sheriff's patrols and a return of Community Youth Gang 
Services Project workers who had been transferred to South-Central Los Angeles 
and other communities when gang violence east of downtown subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"The killing has started again," said Virginia Lopez, a spokeswoman for 
Concerned Parents of East Los Angeles, a group organized 15 years ago to raise 
money to bury victims of gang violence. "We don't want any more suffering." 
</P>
<P>
"We want our gang services back," added Rita Figueroa, who lost two sons in 
1971 and 1973 to problems related to drugs and gangs. "I know what it takes to 
bury them, what it takes out of your life and how it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles, community leaders complain that the presence of gangs is 
often exaggerated by the news media. They estimate that less than 10% of area 
youths are active in gangs. Yet few deny the gangs' existence and the pain and 
suffering they inflict when violence erupts. After two years of relative peace, 
gang violence has returned to unincorporated East Los Angeles. Parent groups 
and individuals are calling for the return of a concerted anti-gang effort.

QUARTERBACK'S PASSING FANCY GIVES FRANKLIN ANOTHER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fernando Dominguez 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another football championship was in the bag for Franklin High School, and 
Coach Armando Gonzalez, the architect of what is shaping into a dynasty, was in 
a jubilant mood. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to take anything away from my other teams," said Gonzalez, who 
has won four city 3-A titles during his eight years at the school, "but this 
one is the best I've ever had. . . . This guy (quarterback Santiago Alvarez) 
has been phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
He won't get much of an argument there. 
</P>
<P>
All Santiago (Chago) Alvarez did last season was become the most prolific 
single-season passer in California high school history by throwing for a state 
record 4,019 yards and 52 touchdowns, which were two short of the national 
mark. He had 11 in 1988, when his 1,643 yards were second in the city's 3-A 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The senior quarterback also equaled the state single-game record with eight 
touchdown tosses for the Highland Park school against Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And he capped the year by leading the then 12-1 Panthers -- with a hefty assist 
from the team's stingy defensive unit, which allowed an average of only four 
points per game -- to the city 3-A title with a 24-6 victory over Garfield at 
East Los Angeles College last month. 
</P>
<P>
In that one, which could have been billed in anatomical terms -- The Arm vs. 
The Legs -- he faced a squad whose offensive scheme centered around Hilario 
Espinosa, a senior running back who rushed for 2,142 yards on the year and who 
scored 25 touchdowns, including the lone one against Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
The upper limb prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the ultimate," commented an exuberant Alvarez during the post-mortem. 
"Right after we scored the first TD, I knew we were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez knows something about winning. He lost only two games as the starting 
quarterback for the Panthers, which is part of the reason why Gonzalez, who has 
had a string of standouts at the position, calls him the school's all-time top 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
"By far he is the best quarterback I've ever coached," noted Gonzalez, whose 
teams have gone 44-5 the last four seasons. "He gets the ball to where it is 
supposed to be, and he picks up secondary receivers real well. One statistic 
that I really look at is completion percentage. He is 62%. In high school, to 
have a kid over 60%, that's amazing. . . . The kid is a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Said wide receiver-defensive back Lamar Lovett, who snatched 19 of Alvarez's 
scoring aerials: "Our receivers (were) good, but he just made us that much 
better. He has tenacity. He comes to play." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and Lovett are not the only ones singing high praises. College 
recruiters, including those from UCLA and USC, have sent letters to Alvarez, 
but a couple of obstacles might prevent him from playing next fall at a major 
(Division I) school. 
</P>
<P>
For one, there's the question of whether, at 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds, he would 
be big enough to play quarterback at a major university. The other is 
academics. He carries a C+ grade average but apparently did not take some 
required college preparatory courses mandated by the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
That would make him a "Proposition 48 athlete," named after an NCAA rule that 
could be toughened for the 1990-91 school year to force such players to sit out 
their freshman year and make them ineligible for a scholarship that season. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't want to lose a year, Alvarez could go the junior college route 
for a couple of seasons, then transfer to a Division I school. One such school, 
Los Angeles Valley College in Van Nuys, wouldn't mind that alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"He's poised and has the athletic ability to scramble," said Valley assistant 
coach Ron Ponciano. "You go to a game to see if anyone jumps at you, and he 
does right away. First time I saw him I thought, 'Good grief!' " 
</P>
<P>
But what about the size? 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless, if you are good, you get the job done. He's got the arm. There's 
no question he can play. He's typical of the athletes at Franklin," Ponciano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback agreed: "People say I'm not tall enough, I'm not heavy enough. 
I think that as long as I get the job done that's what basically it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is not opposed to the junior college option, although he would love to 
wear the gold and blue of UCLA and eventually study physical therapy or sports 
medicine. Besides, he's partial to that institution. He was born at its medical 
center, the youngest of three children of Salvador Alvarez, a junior high 
school English teacher, and Francisca, an accounting manager at a department 
store. 
</P>
<P>
(His father, a former halfback at Army, gave Santiago the nickname chango -- 
Mexican slang for monkey -- because he was such an active child. The nickname 
lost the "n" somewhere along the line.) 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his college plans, Alvarez said, "I would like to stay close to 
home." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of talk, from that kind of talent, is what Southland college football 
recruiters call answered prayers.

"Sweet 15," the season opener for the PBS series "Wonderworks," tells the 
heartwarming story of a 15-year-old Latina, who -- by helping her father gain 
his U.S. citizenship through the amnesty program -- gains new appreciation of 
her Mexican heritage and her father's courage. It stars Karla Montana ("Stand 
and Deliver"), Tony Planta ("Romero") and Susan Ruttan ("L.A. Law"). Airing on 
KCET, the second segment of the two-part production will be shown Jan. 21 at 8 
p.m.

Abbe Lane (who last month celebrated her silver anniversary of marriage to 
cable-TV company owner Perry Leff and the wedding of their oldest son), is 
penning an autobiographical novel for Warner Books. As some of you might 
recall, Lane was appearing on Broadway when discovered by bandleader Xavier 
Cugat (whom she later married). Through their popular stage act and motion 
pictures, the sultry entertainer became the first musical crossover artist -- 
introducing Latin cha-cha and rumba rhythms to American and European audiences 
in the 1950s -- music that remains popular to this day. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of "crossovers," Spanish-language rock has come to L.A. in a big way. 
It all began with Miguel Mateos, whose recent local sellout concerts paved the 
way for Mecano and Soda Stereo. And it now looks as if more Latino rockers will 
be rollicking across our stages throughout 1990. In fact, Mateos (who is in 
town putting the finishing touches on his latest album) kicks off the new year 
by headlining a "Rock en Espanol" ("Rock in Spanish") 20-city U.S. tour, which 
includes concerts in Anaheim and Hollywood. Argentina's Mateos is joined by 
Spain's Duncan Dhu on the tour.

JOSEPH S. CLARK; FOUGHT FOR REFORMS AS SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. Sen. Joseph S. Clark, a liberal and civil rights activist who as 
mayor brought reforms to Philadelphia's City Hall and tried to do the same in 
the halls of Congress, has died. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Clark died at home Friday, said his wife, Iris. No cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
Clark became Philadelphia's first Democratic mayor in 67 years in 1951 and 
later took his advocacy of civil rights to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
A series of speeches he gave in 1963, later published in book form as "The 
Senate Establishment," attacked the upper house as "a self-perpetuating 
oligarchy." He also wrote another book, "Congress: The Sapless Branch." 
</P>
<P>
His election as mayor ended a corruption-ridden Republican administration and 
he replaced the city's spoils system with Civil Service regulations. 
</P>
<P>
He took black friends to the Philadelphia Cricket Club near his home -- the 
first time in the club's 100-year history that blacks had been guests. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Clark was elected to the first of two Senate terms. 
</P>
<P>
He sponsored the Manpower Development and Training Act and the Area 
Redevelopment Act, but was often frustrated by the chamber's ruling powers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate establishment is almost the antithesis of democracy," Clark told 
his Senate colleagues in 1963. "It is what might be called a self-perpetuating 
oligarchy, with only mild overtones of a plutocracy." 
</P>
<P>
James MacGregor Burns, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, called Clark's 
speech "of historical significance, because it aims squarely at this 
century-old coalition as it operates quietly in the Senate. He has moved the 
power process out of dim and musty committee and caucus rooms into the 
spotlight of the Senate floor." 
</P>
<P>
Clark did not initially support John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign, 
but he campaigned hard after the Massachusetts senator was nominated. Kennedy 
asked him to draw up a civil rights agenda for his New Frontier programs. 
</P>
<P>
Clark eventually gained seats on the Senate's Foreign Relations, Labor and 
Public Welfare and Rules and Administration committees. 
</P>
<P>
But his relations with President Lyndon B. Johnson were cool. He complained 
that the War on Poverty lacked sufficient funds. He also broke with the 
Administration over the war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
When he sought reelection in 1968, local Democratic leaders failed to work 
enthusiastically for him and he lost to Republican Richard Schweiker.

Alcoa: The world's largest maker of aluminum products earned a record $944.9 
million for all 1989, a 9.6% rise over 1988's record profit. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a record $10.91 billion, up 11%. For the fourth quarter, earnings 
fell 25% to $164.7 million; sales rose 2% to $2.69 billion. The 
Pittsburgh-based company cited strength in its Australian and Brazilian units, 
accounting for 42% of 1989 profit, during most of the year. However, the fourth 
period was marked by a decline in shipments and revenue, lower prices for ingot 
and most fabricated products, a shift in product mix and higher raw material 
costs.

MORNING REPORT: 'ROAD HOUSE' LOOKS LIKE A HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT , Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One reason the violent "Road House" is such a rental smash -- No. 3 on the new 
Billboard chart -- is that it features not one but two hunks: Patrick Swayze 
and Sam Elliott. So in addition to male action/drama fans, swooning females are 
also renting this one. 
</P>
<P>
Based on its box-office gross, $27 million, the movie was expected to do well 
in the rental market. "Lock Up," starring Sly Stallone, is also a rental hit -- 
No. 7 after just two weeks -- attracting fans who skipped it during its 
theatrical run. For a movie that raked in a tidy $29 million at the box-office, 
the black comedy "Weekend at Bernie's" is a surprisingly mild rental 
attraction. It's only No. 18 after two weeks. Lack of major stars (it features 
Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman) is part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
* The latest James Bond adventure, "Licence to Kill," was overshadowed by all 
those superhits last summer and didn't do blockbuster-type box-office business 
-- though it did pull in a respectable $33 million. But it should be a big draw 
in the rental market, most likely climbing to the Top Five. It debuted on the 
rental chart at No. 22.

Telethon to Come to L.A.: The Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, an entertainment 
fixture in Las Vegas for 17 years, will move to Los Angeles this year, 
officials of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always brought most of the talent in from Los Angeles," said association 
spokesman Jerry Weinberg. "It was much more cost effective to move to Los 
Angeles." The telethon has raised more than half a billion dollars during its 
17-year run in Las Vegas, including last year's record $42 million. BETH KLEID

Roseanne to Tie the Knot?: Less than a month after announcing her wedding plans 
were off, Roseanne Barr was spotted Wednesday taking out a marriage license at 
the Santa Monica Superior Court, although her publicist said Wednesday that 
Barr has not yet married. "I can't believe I'm doing this," Barr was overheard 
saying as she walked in the door to the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Barr will marry her long-time friend and collaborator Tom Arnold, but no 
wedding date has been set, said Barr's publicist Alana Rothstein. "She's still 
literally taking it day by day," Rothstein said. In December, Barr called off 
her Jan. 20 wedding with Arnold, explaining in a statement that he was in an 
alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic. Barr's divorce from husband Tom 
Pentland was scheduled to become finalized Wednesday. BETH KLEID

Jarvi to Direct Detroit Symphony: Neeme Jarvi, an Estonian emigre who is 
principal conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony in Sweden, will replace Gunther 
Herbig as director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, according to Rachelle 
Schlosser, a spokeswoman from Jarvi's record label, Koch International. 
</P>
<P>
Schlosser said Jarvi will take the place of Herbig, who plans to leave for the 
Toronto Symphony when his contract expires in September. Detroit Symphony 
spokeswoman Mary Loiselle declined to confirm or deny the appointment. Herbig 
has been in Detroit since 1984. Jarvi, 52, was scheduled to be guest conductor 
in Detroit for two weeks starting Jan. 26. He has held the guest baton there 
several times. BETH KLEID

'MYTH' SERIES AT U. OF JUDAISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop culture picks through the vast treasure chest of myths and fairy tales, 
uses what's "commercial," throws aside what isn't, and changes them along the 
way. Perhaps this myth form is better than none at all -- that great myth 
lover, Joseph Campbell, also loved "Star Wars." But what do the original 
stories sound like? 
</P>
<P>
Diane Wolkstein, a leading member of a small, hardy band of storytellers who 
travel the country and the world, is providing a glimpse into this world at a 
three-evening presentation, "Fairy Tale, Myth and Narrative," which ends 
tonight at the University of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening's program varies a bit. Tuesday's reading, despite the Judaic 
surroundings, was catholic in taste and scope. The first tale was about a magic 
orange tree, while the second was about how a good little girl can outwit an 
evil stepmother and an acquisitive opportunist. In both, the woods are where 
life is changed, and they exemplified how a story can best teach lessons in 
decent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons were more overt in Hans Christian Andersen's "The Most Incredible 
Thing of All" (which Wolkstein repeats tonight) and "The Clay Digger," a 
compressed saga with an ironic moral. "It's about hope," said Wolkstein, who 
sometimes adds her own post-narrative comments. 
</P>
<P>
These don't get in the way of the tales, though, because Wolkstein functions 
equally as a teacher and a performer. She saved her best performances for the 
concluding tales, an Eskimo adventure as told to film maker Robert Flaherty and 
a fragment from the Sumerian myth of the goddess Inanna. Wolkstein's is an oral 
art, in which she modulates her voice from a booming bass to a willowy whisper, 
but never for mere effect. Like a good actor serving the play, she serves the 
story. The story is enough.

AN INTERESTING BUT NOT FUNNY 'GRAND' START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Grand" isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet, anyway. Premiering at 9:30 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39), 
this is one of those new comedies that demands several viewings before 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
As for now, mark it down as . . . interesting. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand" succeeds "Dear John" in the coveted time slot following "Cheers," with 
"Dear John" moving to 9:30 p.m. Wednesdays in place of "My Two Dads," which is 
moving to Sundays at 8 p.m. in place of "Ann Jillian," which NBC says is on 
hiatus until March. 
</P>
<P>
The cast for "Grand" is Gargantuan; the setting is a Pennsylvania town where 
Janice Pasetti (Pamela Reed) lives in a seedy trailer park with her daughter, 
Edda (Sara Rue), while working as a housekeeper for town patriarch Harris 
Weldon (John Randolph), whose piano factory is losing to foreign competition. 
Also prominent are Weldon's duffo son, Norris (Joel Murray); Weldon's caustic 
chief steward, Desmond (John Neville); Weldon's niece Carol Anne (Bonnie Hunt), 
and Carol Anne's husband, Tom (Michael McKean). 
</P>
<P>
The characters are intriguingly bent, and just introducing them all consumes 
most of the premiere, which finds Janice briefly reunited with her estranged 
husband (Ed Marinaro) while Tom's ambition to modernize the piano works brings 
him into conflict with the growly old Weldon. 
</P>
<P>
With Reed and Randolph especially swell, "Grand" has the cast and other 
ingredients to be special. Despite the sweetened, hairtrigger stereophonic 
laughter that greets nearly every line, however, series creator Michael 
Leeson's opening script is rarely funny. The potential is here, but for the 
moment "Grand" gives you "Chopsticks" instead of Chopin.

JON FADDIS BLOWS UP A STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No, that wasn't a thunder storm that blew through town Monday. It was the 
phenomenal trumpeter Jon Faddis, who during his single night at Catalina's 
strained the bounds of believability, but never his chops. 
</P>
<P>
Long admired as a protege of Dizzy Gillespie, with whom he still plays now and 
then, Faddis brought his own quartet from New York to play music from his 
current Epic album, "Into the Faddisphere." In the course of a 90-minute set, 
he touched all bases, often in his 
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-an-octave-higher vein, but also in several 
explorations of his horn's normal register. 
</P>
<P>
Outstanding in the latter category was "West End Blues," parts of which were 
drawn almost note-for-note from a classic 1928 Louis Armstrong record. Renee 
Rosnes, his Canadian pianist, captured the spirit flawlessly before Faddis took 
over again from some additional touches that Satchmo himself might have envied. 
But instead of quitting while he was ahead, Faddis gave an anti-climactic solo 
to the bass player, James Genus, then began singing a he-and-she vocal in 
alternating male and falsetto voices that was strictly for laughs. He 
ultimately brought his horn back for a magnificent finale. 
</P>
<P>
Faddis as a composer is versatile and creative. "Retro Blue" was a quirky item, 
a blues in form but not in harmonic pattern. "At Long Last" was slow and 
lyrical, "Sambahia" exotic and "Many Paths to the Top of the Mountain" chaotic. 
Billy Drummond, the drummer, had more than enough opportunities to display his 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
Rosnes, looking much too young to have absorbed so many stages in the evolution 
of jazz piano, acquitted herself like the veteran she is not. But Faddis was 
the master pilot here -- a one-man history of jazz trumpet: he even played 
Gillespie's "Dizzy Atmosphere" and Roy Eldridge's "Little Jazz." If there are 
lapses from taste and occasional high note excesses in a Faddis performance, 
they are a small price to pay for the unique mix of virtuosity and beauty of 
which he showed himself capable.

COUNTRY LEGENDS AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The aggressive on-stage merchandising at Tuesday's formidable "Legends of 
Country" triple-bill at the Universal Amphitheatre of George Jones, Merle 
Haggard and Conway Twitty almost rivaled that of a New Kids on the Block show 
for pure hucksterism. Among the countless sale items pitched between sets: a 
$40 video biography of Jones, which, we were promised, contains "the bad years 
. . . on up through these years, the good years." 
</P>
<P>
But are these really the good years for Jones, or either of his two 
co-headliners? The charts indicate that the hits are getting fewer and farther 
between for all involved, and even the action-packed classicism of this 
inviting, gitcher-money's-worth bill couldn't quite fill the Amphitheatre. Up 
on stage, though, the music had not the aura of survival, but (at least in 
Jones' and Haggard's cases) the playful kick of nicely aged White Lightnin'. 
And though Jones complained of bronchitis and Haggard of "something close to 
pneumonia," the healthiness of the Pre-New Traditionalism prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is the most likely of the three to tweak a heart string, and did with his 
cast-iron set of sad-sack dirges -- now rote enough that it even included his 
usual early bluff of "You're beautiful. I may stay here till 4 or 5 in the 
morning," even though he was cast in the opening slot this time. The wide 
collars on the baby-blue suit and the Wally George-style haircut haven't 
changed, nor have the voice nor the set list, both still as classic as they 
come in country. 
</P>
<P>
Twitty held down the middle position, and though he has probably sold the most 
records out of any of the three, his set suffered by comparison due to a 
decided lack of chat or stage personality. (Using a synthesizer to get a steel 
guitar sound didn't win him back any points.) 
</P>
<P>
With the night's loosest, jazziest set, Haggard had the handle on honky-tonk 
spontaneity; fans were treated to the Muskogee Okie trying to decide whether to 
sing "That's the Way Love Goes" in E, E flat or C with his only slightly 
faltering, illness-reduced register. The occasional swing feel afforded by the 
big band, including horns and fiddle, was a timely reminder that Lyle Lovett 
didn't just come out of nowhere. CHRIS WILLMAN

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: 'ALTERNATIVE' AGRICULTURE IS GAINING MOMENTUM IN THE 
MARKETPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When word got out last year that use of daminozide (trade name Alar) might 
threaten the safety of apples, consumers were shaken. If apples -- our 
unofficial national fruit, and famous for healthy eating -- couldn't be 
trusted, what was going on down on the farm? In our desire to produce larger 
and more abundant crops, were we putting ourselves and our environment at risk? 
</P>
<P>
Long before Alar, a movement was already at work. For years, momentum has been 
gathering for "alternative agriculture." This concept recognizes the need to 
find new ways to grow food economically and safely, and without further damage 
to the environment. Its strength rests on the assumption that although 
conflicts do exist, farmers, environmentalists and consumers might all find 
some common ground. 
</P>
<P>
The movement began by questioning the underpinnings of traditional agriculture. 
Take nitrates, widely used as fertilizer. For some time it had been known that 
using excess amounts to maximize crop production was causing a buildup in 
ground water, the reservoir that lies within and beneath the soil. 
</P>
<P>
It also has been shown that levels of pesticides in ground water are rising. 
Most pesticides currently in use are herbicides, which are sprayed onto the 
ground. Previously it had been thought that they were simply absorbed on the 
surface of soil particles, where they would eventually be broken down. But they 
too seeped through to the ground water. Not only were levels higher than 
expected, but the contamination had spread far from where the pesticides were 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this worrisome is that, except for oceans, ground water is the final 
sink. Once chemicals are dissolved or suspended in it, they are there to stay 
-- unless they are taken out when water is used. No one can measure the risk to 
consumers, but evidence shows that we'd be better off with fewer pesticides and 
nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
In rural America, ground water is drinking water. Thus, farmers who live in 
affected areas responded quite naturally with concern about the safety of the 
water supply used by their families. The sharp drop in the price of crops, and 
increased cost of chemicals, provided still more reason for farmers to look for 
alternative methods, if they prove cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are in a key position to affect agricultural practices. But they are by 
no means the only group concerned about potential dangers. The limitations of 
chemical pesticides are now understood. Insects quickly develop resistance, 
rendering a particular pesticide ineffective. And government regulations make 
it expensive to develop and register new ones. If a pesticide might be useless 
after a period of, say, five years, and it costs a lot to come up with a new 
one, the outlook for manufacturers is bleak. There is incentive to diversify. 
Those factors combine with support from environmental groups to press for 
finding safer methods of raising our food. 
</P>
<P>
These alternatives will emerge from a blend of modern advances and traditional 
techniques. One objective is to identify natural methods of controlling 
agricultural pests, making use of pesticides less necessary. Part of this 
solution lies in breeding disease-resistant strains of crops. 
</P>
<P>
In most of nature, plants grow without pesticides and fertilizers, so one 
approach will be to search older varieties of commercial plants and their wild 
relatives for desirable qualities that can be bred into commercial species 
while maintaining satisfactory yields. This plan relies on traditional breeding 
methods. But the objectives are broadened to include disease resistance and 
reduced need for fertilizer, as well as yield. 
</P>
<P>
A second goal is to provide a favorable habitat for natural organisms that can 
control pests. A third is to capitalize on natural sources of fertilizers. Crop 
residues ranging from tomato plants to corn husks can be plowed back into the 
soil to enrich it. Livestock manure can be treated and used safely. And 
leguminous plants harboring nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their roots can be used 
to furnish the nitrogen that crops need. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is a job for amateurs. Researchers at the nation's land-grant 
universities, sites of much agricultural research, are hard at work. Also, more 
and more, grass roots groups and other private organizations are exploring 
economically viable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
On the farm itself, important changes are expected. In the past, government 
programs to assist farmers have encouraged greater specialization in crop 
production. That, in turn, led to more use of pesticides. It is thought that 
these programs will now be rewritten with an eye toward developing alternative 
farming methods. It's true that, to date, concern about problems with 
traditional agriculture has outstripped progress in finding suitable 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
But now, however quietly, the revolution has begun. And there is every reason 
to believe it will flourish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking More Vitamins Is Not the Answer for Warming Up Cold Feet 
</P>
<P>
Question: My hands and feet suffer in cold weather. I just can't keep them warm 
enough, even with good boots and mittens. A friend said she'd read that B 
complex vitamins could help. I know you tend to oppose large doses of vitamins, 
but do you think that in my case they could provide some relief? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Sorry, but there is no evidence to support this. We can only guess at 
the basis for such a claim. Cold temperatures are a form of environmental 
stress, and the widely available "stress formula" vitamins are usually mixtures 
of large doses of Vitamin C and members of the B complex vitamins. There is 
likewise no data to support the use of these supplements in coping with stress, 
either mental or physical, but perhaps they are somehow entwined with the rumor 
that B vitamins will protect you from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
A second explanation for the claim relates to the immediate physiologic effect 
of one form of niacin, called nicotinic acid. When taken in large amounts, 
nicotinic acid causes dilation of blood vessels and temporary flushing. This 
brief effect wouldn't do you much good on a trek on a cold winter's day. 
Besides, while niacin is now used in big doses in the treatment of elevated 
serum cholesterol, it has the potential for harmful side effects, and should be 
used only under a doctor's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My 14-year-old son is considerably shorter than all his friends. I try not 
to show it, but I'm concerned. I think he eats well, but I wonder if there are 
dietary steps we could take to help him grow. 
</P>
<P>
A: No, and any claims to the contrary are irresponsible. It is true that some 
children go through their growth spurts much later than others. If he's among 
that group, time will solve the problem. Remember, too, that genetics is a 
powerful predictor of height, so it's important to take into account both your 
own and your husband's stature. Short parents are less likely to have tall 
offspring. But if you are worried that your son's growth is not proceeding at a 
normal rate, and have not already done so, schedule an appointment with his 
physician to rule out any health problem that could delay growth. 
</P>
<P>
At no time is it more important to ensure that the diet provides enough 
calories and sufficient amounts of essential nutrients than when children are 
still growing. That can be achieved by consuming ample amounts of dairy 
products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole 
grain or lightly processed breads and cereals. In addition, a single 
multivitamin and mineral containing 100 percent of the RDA for each nutrient 
can provide some nutritional insurance. Supplements sold as growth promoters 
are a waste of your hard-earned cash. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are prenatal fluoride supplements helpful to the unborn infant's teeth? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Although there is no evidence that they are harmful, there is no data to 
show that they are of benefit, either. To begin with, any benefit that did 
occur would affect only the deciduous or "baby teeth." It is generally believed 
that it is a good idea to start fluoride supplements for the infant shortly 
after birth. But there is no evidence that caries prevention is extended by the 
use of prenatal fluoride supplements. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does a bulging lid on a can mean that the food inside is spoiled? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not necessarily. But all the same, we urge you not to use the contents. 
</P>
<P>
There are three reasons why a lid might bulge. It could occur in response to a 
dent in the can. Or, it could be caused by a chemical reaction between the food 
and the container, resulting in the release of hydrogen gas. Pressure from the 
expansion of the gas makes the lid swell. Then there's the other possibility: 
The bulging lid may be a sign that botulism spores are multiplying and 
producing a potentially deadly toxin. 
</P>
<P>
Since it's impossible to diagnose the cause of the bulge with certainty in your 
kitchen, the only reasonable alternatives are either to return the container 
and its contents to the store where you bought it, or to discard it in such a 
way that pets and other animals cannot consume the contents. We should point 
out that the risk of botulism food poisoning from commercially canned foods is 
minute.

ABOUT WINE: DECIDING ON A STERLING CHOICE FOR THE 'WINE MAKER OF THE YEAR' 
AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

CALISTOGA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academics put numbers on wine. Wine lovers drink it. And although Sterling 
Vineyards frequently makes wine that scores high in the numbers game, by and 
large it is a winery that hits near perfection in the only game wine lovers 
care about: satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling makes wines that are not, by house style, big, bold and brassy. So 
they are not immediately loved by those who seek obviousness. They are lean, 
delicate and refined, with a classic touch in virtually everything. 
</P>
<P>
The Chardonnays are not sweet or over-oaked or infused with a butter/vanilla 
exclamation point; the Cabernets don't have enough wood to make Gepetto 
envious; the Pinot Noir isn't a motor oil look-alike. These wines are 
appreciated most by those with a cool hand and a keen eye and horse sense. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the last few years the quality of Sterling wines has slowly, silently 
crept up to a point where they sing notes other wine makers envy. 
</P>
<P>
Each December I take stock of the preceding wine year in the United States and 
try to come up with a Wine Maker of the Year, a person who exemplifies what 
wine making ought to be -- innovative, creative, and dedicated to a house style 
that varies only as much as Mother Nature requires. And it is a person who 
moves forward annually, making noticeable improvements in the state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Tussling with myself, I finally decided that the honor must go to Bill Dyer of 
Sterling Vineyards in the Napa Valley. The consistency of Sterling wines since 
its founding two decades ago is unquestioned, and though some of the wines 
don't score lots of points in tastings by academics, the wines are impeccably 
made and prototypes that wine lovers appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
As I thought about this Wine Maker of the Year honor, something gnawed at me. I 
asked, "Isn't the wine maker handcuffed to a huge degree by the grapes he gets? 
Isn't his greatness partially the result of a great viticulturist, a person who 
grows superb grapes?" 
</P>
<P>
So it stands to reason that Tucker Catlin, Sterling's longtime viticulturist, 
deserves half of the Wine Maker of the Year award for his continuing dedication 
to a program that has shown slow, steady growth within a framework that changes 
little. 
</P>
<P>
When you speak of greatness in wine making, viticultural people rarely get just 
reward, though wine makers tell you. Dick Arrowood is a great wine maker. But 
ask him about his famed Belle Terre Vineyard Chardonnay and he'll credit Ron 
Dick and his son, Henry, owners of the Belle Terre Vineyard, for producing "the 
cleanest fruit you can buy." He'll say the Dick family delivers ripe fruit 
without leaves in the gondolas. "I love dealing with them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Andy Cutter at Duxoup credits Mike Teldeschi and sons Ray and Gary 
for his sensational Napa Gamay grapes, as well as Jean Frediani and her son, 
Jim, for the superb Charbono grapes he gets. 
</P>
<P>
The story is the same all over: Beringer wine maker Ed Sbragia credits Bob 
Steinhauer, one of the finest staff viticulturists in the business; Rollin 
Wilkinson, the longtime viticulturist for The Christian Brothers, improved the 
quality of his winery's wines for decades; Andy Beckstoffer is a respected Napa 
and Mendocino grower; Phil Freese at Mondavi keeps eye on vine and nose in 
glass; Dale Hampton's grapes from Santa Maria and Angelo Sangiacomo's Carneros 
fruit both are highly prized by more than a dozen wineries; Doug Hill at 
Trefethen, the Rochioli family in Sonoma County. . . . The list is long and the 
names generally unfamiliar to even the most dedicated wine lovers. 
</P>
<P>
At Sterling, Catlin gets the credit for handling the diverse vineyards now 
owned and managed by the company. And he shares this honor as Wine Maker of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, a Seagram division, now owns about 700 acres of Napa Valley vineyard 
land and manages another 400 acres under contract. These properties are some 40 
miles apart and range from hot hillside climate to cold, flat land. The growing 
conditions are wildly divergent in terms of soil too so Catlin deals with each 
in a unique manner. 
</P>
<P>
That gives Dyer a multitude of different elements he can weave together in 
trying to hone the best possible wine from each variety, yet still keep to the 
refined house style. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer, who is married to Dawnine Sample Dyer, wine maker at Domaine Chandon, 
arrived at Sterling in 1977 and worked under various wine making regimes until 
he took over for the harvest of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"That almost coincided with some major changes in our vineyards," he said. "We 
had acquired a big vineyard in the Yountville area that gives me Chardonnay. It 
accounts for something like 50% to 60% of our estate Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also when we started making Chardonnay with 100% barrel fermentation 
and sur lie aging (on the lees, which are dead yeast cells)." By dealing with 
the grapes delicately, Dyer retained the superb Yountville fruit, and in the 
last three years, Sterling Chardonnay, always superb, has exceeded itself. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer's first Merlot, 1985, was a towering success, a wine of immense appeal. He 
modestly says, "We were dealing with a pretty exceptional vintage in 1985, and 
because of that I didn't feel the Merlot required any Cabernet Sauvignon, so I 
added only 3% Cabernet Franc. It was a very refined wine," but a wine of such 
broad appeal because of its ability please now but age for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
The masterpiece of Dyer's career thus far is Sterling's 1985 Reserve, a red 
wine of remarkable depth and proportion, but one that should age gorgeously. 
Dyer points out that this wine, 75% of which is made up of the best lots of 
Cabernet that Sterling had in house, was assembled with a different point of 
view from the one that existed in the 1970s, when many wine makers sought more 
and more in their red wines. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the '70s, there was this perspective, that the wine had to be very 
assertive and brawny, a little bit ugly in its youth, if it was to blossom into 
something great as it aged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can remember when I went to Bordeaux (in 1981) and tasted some of the 
wines out of the barrel. The wines were very attractive and supple. Well, ours 
in California were coarse and rustic, and I began to get the feeling that we 
had to do a better job, to look for suppleness." 
</P>
<P>
He said it required care in the selection process, making sure certain barrels 
of wine were never used in the final wine. "You have to have concentration of 
fruit, but you have to look for those wines that have suppleness. Back in that 
1970's, they were looking for the wines that had the really potent entry and 
the powerful finish -- boxcar wines that they said were going to keep on 
rolling. But I figured that without suppleness, all you had was a clumsy wine." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer called the Reserve "the most personally satisfying, because it has the 
most to do with wine making. It is a selection, an assembled wine." He likes 
working too on the big, chunky Diamond Mountain Cabernets, he said, "you have 
to work on the suppleness. I've been blending in Cabernet Franc, doing some 
fining and aeration of the wine, to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
When Seagram bought the Winery Lake Vineyard in the cold Carneros region, it 
gave Dyer one more element to deal with, and his Winery Lake Chardonnays have 
been spectacular: similar in many ways to the Napa Valley-designated wine, but 
with a concentration of tropical fruit aromas that almost defies description. 
</P>
<P>
A problem child thus far from Winery Lake is Pinot Noir, which Dyer said varies 
a great deal from area to area. "One real obvious cut was from the deeper, 
richer soils. The Pinot Noir there was quite different from the hillside vines, 
and we quit making wine from that area." Those vines were converted to 
Chardonnay, "and one of the best blocks of Chardonnay is from that deeper 
soil." 
</P>
<P>
Catlin is a major contributor to Sterling's consistency. A quiet man with grin 
wrinkles and a charming wit, Catlin says modestly he doesn't know anything 
about wine. But that's like saying Tony Gwynn doesn't know anything about 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"Tucker's impact is mainly in being very present," said Dyer. "We have a 
feedback mechanism where he's looking at the wines and I'm looking at the 
growing techniques and we talk constantly about it. This close feedback is 
important, and really it began only recently," about a year ago, when Catlin 
moved his office from a field location to an office adjacent to Dyer's in the 
alabaster fortress above the Napa Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
In assembling a list of Wine Makers of the Year in the United States, one must 
look at so many factors including the ability to make great wine from a wide 
variety of grapes; improvement from year to year, and dealing with adversity. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, any listing of a top 10 would leave someone out, for one of at least 
two reasons: either I didn't know about a particular wine maker, or a name 
slipped my mind. It therefore might be considered dangerous to print such a 
list, but the "next 10 best" wine makers, in my opinion, is a list that 
includes a number of people who deserve recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, then, here is my list of "the 10 next best;" it probably isn't 
complete and may (accidentally) leave someone out. My apologies in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Griffin -- Hogue Cellars, Washington: The two Hogue wines that knocked me 
out in 1989 were a Semillon and a Riesling, but everything else Griffin touched 
turned to gold at one fair or another. This may be the best non-California U.S. 
winery of them all. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Brown -- Byron, Santa Maria Valley: Brown, formerly at Zaca Mesa and now 
with a winery recently acquired by Robert Mondavi, is one of those rare 
individuals insightful enough to spot potential problems and halt them before 
they erupt. His Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays have become world-beaters, proving 
once again the worth of the Santa Barbara growing region. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Farrell -- Russian River Valley: Using the Russian River fruit to make a 
bold and gorgeous statement with Pinot Noirs and a number of other varieties, 
Farrell has stamped himself one of the brightest lights in the game today. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Johns -- St. Clement, Napa Valley: Without fanfare, and without owning 
any vineyards (!) Johns has, in the last two years, developed some of the Napa 
Valleys best Chardonnays, Cabernets, and Sauvignon Blancs made entirely from 
purchased grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Babcock -- Santa Ynez Valley: Using a bold, aggressive style that calls 
for barrel fermentation of even varieties such as Gewurztraminer, Babcock has 
developed a huge cult following for his tiny production. Occasionally 
eccentric, always exciting wines. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Henn -- Pindar, New York: Situated out on untested Long Island, Henn's 
attention to detail has created one of the nation's top new red wines, 
Mythology, establishing Pindar as a winery to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Stuart -- Silverado Vineyards, Napa Valley: A track record almost 
unmatched for consistently superior Cabernet, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 
was upgraded in 1989 with more greatness. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Harvey -- Santino, Amador County: His bold red wines (notably Zinfandel 
and Barbera) and spectacular late-harvest white wines were overwhelming last 
year, and represent excellent values. 
</P>
<P>
George Bursick -- Ferrari-Carano, Sonoma County: The first releases from this 
Dry Creek property, using spectacular Alexander Valley fruit, were stunning and 
improved in 1989, and new wines from Carneros vineyards added more luster to an 
already glowing image. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pease -- Clos Pegase, Napa Valley: Situated across Dunaweal Lane in 
Calistoga, Clos Pegase has been rather quiet since erecting an eclectic edifice 
that elicited excitement, pro and con, from neighbors. But the wines, lean and 
direct, are gorgeous examples of fruit without overt tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
In dozens of ways, wine makers have praised the grape growers for their 
success. Here are just a few. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Swan, the late Russian River wine maker: "Use good grapes and don't screw 
'em up." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Tchelistcheff, to Andy and Debra Cutter on their wedding day: "I have a 
present for you, a bit of advice: 'It's the grapes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robin Day; Orlando Wines, Australia: "Get good grapes and don't trip on the mat 
on your way out of the winery." 
</P>
<P>
In my interview with Dyer, he added a line worth quoting: "When I was in the 
cellars of Henri Jayer in Burgundy, I kept asking him, 'What's the secret (to 
your red wines)? Do you add stems? Is it the fermentation temperature? The 
length of time in the barrel? And he finally said, 'It all boils down to just 
one thing: the grapes.' That's the secret."

SUPERMARKET EXECUTIVES SEE FOOD SAFETY AS CONSUMER ISSUE OF THE 1990S; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE CONTROVERSY OVER USING CHEMICALS IN FOOD PRODUCTION CONTINUES. SOME 
BELIEVE THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO INCREASED PRODUCE SALES IS FURTHER PROBLEMS WITH 
FOOD SAFETY.

Successfully calming consumers fears over pesticide residues in produce is the 
key to increasing sales of fresh fruit and vegetables in the coming decade, a 
panel of Southern California supermarket executives told an industry gathering 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been quiet for the past six months, but food safety will be the issue 
for the 1990s," said Larry Cox, of Lucky Stores, at a luncheon meeting of the 
Fresh Produce Council, a trade group, at the Quiet Cannon restaurant in 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Cox was joined by representatives from several other leading food retailers 
including Ralphs Grocery Co., the Vons Companies and Hughes Markets. 
Interestingly, the panel was assembled to discuss the future of produce 
merchandising, but the discussion repeatedly turned to the food safety 
question. 
</P>
<P>
(Public concerns over pesticide residues in food reached record highs during 
1989, prompted, in part, by a report that indicated children were more 
vulnerable to these toxins than adults.) 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that can stop us from increasing produce sales in the 1990s -- 
as we did in the 1980s -- is further problems with food safety. We have to 
emphasize to the public how healthy produce is," said Don Ikemoto of Vons. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four indicated that the farm chemical controversy continues and 
that supermarket companies need to help clarify the issue for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the chains' efforts in this area are directed at educating produce 
department managers and clerks to respond intelligently to questions about 
pesticide residues from shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have trained our people to answer food safety questions because it is a big 
issue that they have to address," said Ikemoto. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the speakers admitted, though, that more could be done. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last year, (supermarket) produce managers' knowledge of this issue has 
grown tremendously, said Cox. "But if we gathered 10 Lucky produce managers 
here there would be a variety of opinions on food safety and we need to work on 
(making that more uniform)." 
</P>
<P>
However, the size of some supermarket chains, with hundreds of stores, makes it 
difficult to distribute a unified message to employees thus adding to the 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have communicated a great deal to our produce managers and clerks about the 
food safety issue. But to get the message to everyone is a real challenge," 
said Dave Ackerman of Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
One retailer warned that although it is important to make sure store employees 
are briefed on controversial issues such as pesticides it could be dangerous to 
mislead consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorting out opinion from fact is important. But if we are passing on 
information to our customers then it better be real close to accurate or you're 
going to be in for some real embarrassment down the road," said Roger Schroeder 
of Hughes Markets. "The more we can do to let people know that produce is good 
for them, then the more fruit and vegetables we will sell." The produce 
executives also discussed several other issues involving produce sales. One 
said the chains could do a better job in maintaining the appearance of their 
produce sections. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the professionalism of 25 years ago in the produce counter," said Cox. 
"We are not doing as good a job as we have to in order to sell more product. 
There is room to grow. . . . I wish we could find a way to put out consistently 
fine presentations-not just in our best stores-but in all of our stores." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Cox said that supermarkets today offer more variety of fruit and 
vegetables in better condition and at better prices than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers also bemoaned the labor shortage that continues to hurt the 
food retailing industry. At a time when the public seems to want more personal 
service from stores there are not enough employees to properly staff the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could better tap into the labor market because most of our problems 
are labor driven," said Ackerman. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schroeder said that it was unlikely the major supermarket chains would 
greatly increase store personnel because of profit considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"More labor in the stores? I don't see that happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if the grocers did not have enough to worry about with food safety and 
labor shortages, they were also taken to task by Karen Caplan, the president of 
the Fresh Produce Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not enough creative selling being done today," she said. "We need to 
be more creative because we are getting a little lazy."

PREVIEWING FOODS OF TOMORROW; 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE: THE FOOD INDUSTRY PREDICTS THAT READY-TO-EAT WILL BE NORMAL AND THAT 
ASIANS AND LATINOS WILL INTRODUCE NEW FOODS.

June and Ward Cleaver don't live here anymore, but neither do the Jetsons. 
</P>
<P>
All the Buck Rogers soothsayers who predicted we'd be popping pills instead of 
eating real food at the turn of the 21st Century can now start munching on 
their words. 
</P>
<P>
What we eat tomorrow will still look a lot like the stuff we eat today. The 
difference will come in the way food technologists engineer the foods so they 
are healthier for us, last longer, taste better and get to the table faster. 
</P>
<P>
The stay-at-home trends the futurists call nesting or cocooning are expected to 
continue as the baby boom generation enters middle age, but eating at home 
doesn't mean Mom or Dad will be baking bread and making homemade soup. 
</P>
<P>
They may be staying home more at night, but in more and more households both 
parents are working during the day -- a major factor that will influence what 
we eat. From 1975 to 1988, the percentage number of working women with children 
younger than 18 grew from 47.4% to 65%, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. And even more moms are expected in the workplace during the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The working mother is beginning to promote the idea of the family getting 
together for a sit-down meal," says Bob Messenger of Palatine, Ill., editor and 
publisher of the Food Trends Newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"But here is the big difference -- they are not going to eat meals prepared 
from scratch. They will be meals prepared in advance or take-home meals. Food 
companies are going to be pressured to produce more upscale frozen or 
shelf-stable dinners, and supermarkets will try to respond with fresh, 
ready-to-eat dinners." 
</P>
<P>
Another important influence will be smaller households with more money to 
spend. The Newspaper Advertising Bureau says that one- and two-person 
households, now accounting for 45% of all discretionary income, will account 
for 60% by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the forces we have seen in the 1980s will continue to grow in the '90s. 
Martin J. Friedman, editor of New Product News, says he sees the future in six 
"f" words -- fat, fiber, foreign, fancy, fast and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"Most food trends are an evolution rather than a revolution," he says. "We are 
not going to switch in 10 years to eating pills instead of food. But we do have 
a general decline in the taste standards. Young people's ideas of great fried 
chicken is not what grandma used to make; it's Kentucky Fried Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
What will happen to food in the 1990s? The following predictions were compiled 
from interviews with 20 trend-spotters, trade magazine journalists, food 
industry representatives and researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Americans will continue to believe that they are what they eat, 
reinforcing the notion that nutrition sells. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report on grocery marketing in Advertising Age pointed out that the 
link between diet and health is the most significant of the new rules facing 
the $354-billion grocery business for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"While the products that set the style of the '80s fluctuated wildly between 
consumers' desire to eat light -- for example, Lean Cuisine, Diet Coke, 
Nutrasweet -- and their enthusiastic self-indulgence -- perhaps best 
represented by the DoveBar -- brands that succeed in the 1990s must address 
Americans' hope for a longer life through a healthy diet via fat substitutes, 
not sugar substitutes," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to agree that fat will be the nutritional buzzword of the next 
decade. And most significant is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's review 
of safety data for fat substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The product most likely to get approval first is Monsanto Co.'s Simplesse, a 
protein made of milk and egg whites. The company has petitioned FDA for its use 
in frozen desserts, but Simplesse could eventually be used in a variety of 
products from salad dressings to cheese. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials are more conservative about approval of Procter &amp; Gamble's 
Olestra, a fat substitute with no fat, no cholesterol and no calories. It would 
be used primarily for frying and sauteing and would open the door to myriad 
uses in processed food. Consumer groups have expressed concern that rat tests 
performed by Procter &amp; Gamble have showed increases in tumor rates as well 
as liver changes, but company officials maintain the product is safe. 
</P>
<P>
This also may be the decade for the approval of Lev-O-Cal, a form of sugar 
without calories. The L-sugar, also known as a left-handed sugar, is the mirror 
image of regular sugar and therefore cannot be digested. Biospherics Inc. of 
Beltsville, Md., received a patent on the sugar in 1981 and tests are 
continuing. Gilbert Levin, Biospherics' president, says he hopes the product 
will be on the market by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The eat-for-health movement also includes foods that make outright medical 
claims. And Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, a non-profit consumer group, says government will have to 
get tough with the manufacturers' health claims in the '90s. Already we have 
seen advertisements promising that beef will give you strength and cereal boxes 
that promise cancer prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"The food giants have gotten away with marketing murder," Jacobson says. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: The ready-to-eat concept will be as much a way of life as 
ready-to-wear. 
</P>
<P>
Trade journals and food experts agree that shelf-stable foods and refrigerated 
meals will compete aggressively with frozen for the consumer food dollar. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest challenge is who -- the supermarket or the manufacturer -- will 
best be able to please the consumer with fresh, ready-to-eat dinners, according 
to Friedman of New Product News. Manufacturers' efforts have failed previously 
because of the time lag between preparation and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Doyle, food trends analyst and president of the Consumer Network in 
Philadelphia, agrees that refrigerated takeout hits consumer hot buttons 
because it eliminates stress and the need to plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh and ready is what takeout is really based on," she says. "And 
refrigerated alternatives to fast food, frozen food and restaurant food are 
bubbling up and creating excitement. Takeout, fresh and ready, is more 
comfortable, hassle-free and much faster than eating out. The British have it . 
. . the Japanese have it . . . the Americans want it." 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Consumers will face a conflict between a need for convenience and a 
desire to save the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Truly biodegradable packaging is sure to become an issue in the 1990s as state 
and local governments enact tough environmental laws and consumers demand less 
of a disposable life style. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle's Philadelphia organization, which maintains a 5,000-member panel of 
consumers across the country, has found that people are asking for help to wean 
themselves from what they call "damaging convenience." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the state of our knowledge of what is environmentally sound is where 
we were with nutrition 15 years ago," she says. "We are all on a learning 
curve. And we are all hooked on a convenience life style. More important than 
the fast cooking in the microwave is the throwaway factor. Just listen to what 
the kids say -- there's no cleanup because it all goes in the trash. What are 
we prepared to give up?" 
</P>
<P>
The industry isn't standing still on this issue. A Newspaper Advertising Bureau 
survey of food and supermarket executives predicted that 90% of all grocery 
packaging will be biodegradable by the year 2010. And manufacturers, such as 
the Campbell Soup Co., already have task forces to study the trade-off between 
convenience and ecology. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to eventually go back to transferring the food to another dish to 
cook the microwavable food," says Dick Nelson, director of marketing services 
for Campbell's. 
</P>
<P>
"But our research shows us if we take away the slightest convenience, the 
consumer turns off. It's like going to a lesser house or a lesser car. We don't 
like to cut back on the convenience we have achieved. But the concept of 
keeping the world green (the European Greens movement) is going to make people 
realize that they may have to do something themselves about disposable goods." 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: The microwave will become more of a factor in our lives as 
technology advances. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us have been turned off by real cooking in the microwave and use it 
only to heat water or save time baking potatoes. Coming technological advances 
-- such as susceptors for crisping and browning foods -- are likely to change 
our cooking habits. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 60% of American homes have microwaves, and the experts say they will be 
in 90% of homes by 2000. Many of us will have more than one -- microwaves in 
our cars and pods of microwaves in our homes, one for each family member. 
</P>
<P>
"Children today are learning to cook in the microwave," adds Dick Nelson of 
Campbell's. "They don't learn to cook on the top of the stove. They don't learn 
the oven. As kids adopt the microwave as a primary cooking appliance, the 
standards of what food looks like and tastes like will change." 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Escalating numbers of Asian and Hispanic immigrants will introduce 
us to new foods. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 20 plants feed the planet out of a universe of 20,000, says Noel D. 
Vietmeyer of the National Research Council. As recent immigrants from Southeast 
Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America continue to flock to the United States, 
he says, they will demand the fruits and vegetables of their homelands. Soon 
the rest of us will be comfortable using everything from lemon grass to jicama. 
</P>
<P>
For example, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists in Beaumont, Texas, have 
responded to requests from Cambodian refugees to develop a jasmine rice that 
could be grown locally. The rice, which releases a jasmine scent when it cooks, 
is a long grain that produces a stickier texture that Asians prefer. Charles 
Bollich, a Department of Agriculture research agronomist working on the 
project, says Jasmine 85 should be released as a new variety within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Food technology will help us avoid pesticides and eat healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic engineering and biotechnology will help solve some of the problems we 
faced during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are working on producing fruits and vegetables that are naturally 
resistant to disease and insects. Research is continuing on injecting good 
bacteria into eggs to prevent salmonella food poisoning, on making fish larger 
and beef leaner. 
</P>
<P>
So where is all this headed in the next decade? 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Lempert, editor and publisher of the Lempert Report, a biweekly food 
marketing analysis, says customers are becoming more knowledgeable and more 
sophisticated. As a result, "me-too" and weird products just aren't going to 
sell as well. 
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the '90s, the American consumer will be more demanding of an 
honest and healthy food supply," he says. "The headlines of 'killer foods' or 
'magic bullets' will be replaced with moderation. Environmentally and 
politically friendly issues will become part of our lives as well as our 
kitchen table."

PROFITING FROM A PACK OF PEPPERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCTS: OUTERBRIDGE'S ORIGINAL SHERRY PEPPERS SAUCE, A BERMUDAN FAVORITE NOW 
MARKETED IN U.S. GOURMET SHOPS, IS BASED ON A RECIPE CONCOCTED BY BRITISH 
SAILORS IN THE 1600S.

FLATTS, Bermuda 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is virtually no manufacturing in this 22-mile-long, 2-mile-wide, fish 
hook-shaped island chain in the Western Atlantic, not even raw materials for 
export. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one Bermuda-made product found next to the salt and pepper shakers 
in virtually every home and restaurant here, and it is also sold in gourmet 
shops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, New York and all across America. 
</P>
<P>
It comes from the basement of Yeaton Outerbridge's 300-year-old home in Flatts, 
a tiny village in Smith's Parish on Harrington Sound. 
</P>
<P>
It is Outerbridge's Original Sherry Peppers Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Outerbridge concocts his spicy seasoning from Sherry imported from Spain and 
from 17 spices and cherry peppers imported from America. The sauce steeps in 
50-gallon vats for nine months before it is bottled. 
</P>
<P>
The sauce is a 300-year-old Bermuda tradition, having started with British 
sailors on sailing vessels in the Royal Navy in the 1600s. They called it 
pepper wine. 
</P>
<P>
After a few days at sea, food without refrigeration would begin to spoil, and 
sherry peppers sauce made it palatable. In those days, the peppers were grown 
in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"Bermudans traditionally grew the cherry peppers in their back yards and made 
their own sherry peppers sauce," explained Outerbridge, 62, as he stirred the 
sauce steeping in his basement vats. 
</P>
<P>
"But peppers were becoming scarce. Not everyone had them. That's when my late 
cousin, Robert Outerbridge, a World War II RAF pilot, and I decided to make the 
sauce commercially in 1964."

<P>
Today, only a few of the 57,000 Bermudans on this island chain, 568 miles east 
of Cape Hatteras, N.C., make their own supplies of the condiment. They leave 
that to Outerbridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Bermudans pour sherry peppers on almost everything they eat," Outerbridge 
said. "They are addicted to it because it adds zest to everything from soup and 
scrambled eggs to grouse, grilled cheese and scaloppine." 
</P>
<P>
There is a saying in the islands that Bermuda fish chowder, the national dish, 
is not Bermuda fish chowder without Outerbridge's sherry peppers sauce. 
</P>
<P>
For visitors to this land of sparkling beaches, mild temperatures, whistling 
tree frogs and land crabs, a popular souvenir is a bottle of Outerbridge's 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Outerbridge, who sells his product in all 50 American states and does a big 
mail order business, is a 14th-generation Bermudan, a descendant of Thomas 
Outerbridge, who came here from Yorkshire in 1619. 
</P>
<P>
He makes a dozen other condiments and jellies in his basement kitchen, but 
sherry peppers sauce makes up two-thirds of his sales. The logo for Outerbridge 
Peppers Ltd. shows the company name embracing the word sauces with flames 
leaping from each letter. 
</P>
<P>
Outerbridge would not disclose the company's annual sales, but he admitted to 
making a "tidy" income from his small basement industry, with 50% of his 
production sold in Bermuda and 50% in the United States.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: JELLIES, SPREADS AND JAMS CAUSE CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I don't understand the differences between jam, jelly and fruit 
spreads. Can you define them? 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY, Minneapolis 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Jam is fruit that has been cooked and pureed into a soft and 
thick consistency. It can also be made from vegetables -- zucchini chutney or 
jam, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Jelly is made from fruit juice or clear liquid and syrup or sugar. It is called 
jelly because when cooked the mixture gels. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit spreads are usually smooth and thick, and are made from fruit pulp and 
spices. 
</P>
<P>
Since all these different terms can be confusing, the most important thing is 
to read the jar label carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I am seriously watching my calories as I fight the ever-present 
enemy, my bulging waistline. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest tasks for me was dining out with friends or family. I had a 
habit of splurging because I would follow their lead when ordering. To finally 
get this situation under control I started ordering first, after explaining to 
everyone why I needed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
I've almost reached my goal now and I still enjoy dinners out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GLORIA, Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Often I need to take an entire label off of a jar for a refund or 
a special offer and I can't get it off in one piece. It usually ends up in 
pieces and in the trash. Do you know of an easy way to remove one? 
</P>
<P>
 -- P. B., Lititz, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR P. B.: One of the easiest ways to remove a label is to moisten a couple of 
paper towels or a cloth with hot water and wrap it around the label on the jar. 
Leave it on for a few minutes and remove. The label should peel off. If not, 
remoisten the cloth and try again. 
</P>
<P>
When the label is damp, peel gently because it will tear quite easily. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a favorite recipe that calls for finely minced candied 
fruits. The problem was the fruit was so sticky and difficult to cut. 
</P>
<P>
I cut the fruit into small pieces and put them in the food processor to mince 
and now I enjoy baking even more since my favorite dessert is so easy to make. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JAMIE, San Antonio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I just know that my hint will save a lot of moms and dads the 
trouble of baby-bottle nipples and caps getting ruined or lost in the 
dishwasher. I put them in a small hosiery bag (made to wash hosiery in a 
washing machine) and secure them by tying the bag to the top rack of my 
dishwasher.

FOR AMERICAN PALATES, FOOD PREFERENCES REMAIN BASICALLY UNCHANGED; 
</P>
<P>
NUTRITION: PERSONAL CHOICE AND ECONOMICS, NOT JUST HEALTH AWARENESS, PLAY PART 
IN WHAT FOODS WE EAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WARREN J. BELASCO, Belasco is the author of Appetite for Change: How the 
Counterculture Took on the Food Industry, 1966-1988, to be published this 
spring by Pantheon. He teaches American studies at the University of Maryland, 
Baltimore County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press reports to the contrary, we haven't all abandoned iceberg lettuce for 
arugula and hamburgers for poached fish. The nation is split into two food 
camps and the reasons why tell us a lot about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe the style-page columnists, America is in the thick of the New 
Age of Food Consciousness. We've changed our food habits and preferences in 
dramatic ways, they tell us. Not only are we obsessed with eating more 
healthfully, we're also becoming gastronomic sophisticates -- healthy gourmets. 
These are dizzying times, but while the food "trendies" get most of the 
attention, they don't get the lion's share of the shelf space. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if you visit the average suburban supermarket or restaurant strip, you 
will confirm what food-marketing researchers have been insisting for more than 
15 years -- despite all the hype, most people remain loyal to the American 
standard foods we've supposedly cut back on. Thus, a Gallup Poll of dinner-time 
restaurant patrons several years ago found that 59% would order plain corn as 
their most likely side dish, while only 8% would order the borderline-exotic 
zucchini vinaigrette. For the main course, 10-to-1 would opt for prime rib 
instead of blackened redfish. 
</P>
<P>
While blackened redfish is pushing it, the majority also remains indifferent to 
far more serious trends. Even at the height of the 1989 Alar-pesticide-cyanide 
scare, 73% in one poll remained "completely or mostly confident" about 
supermarket food safety. Although just about everyone occasionally voices some 
worries, when it comes to shopping, cooking and eating, those who actually 
change their behavior rarely top a third of any sample, frequently less. 
Despite all the advice to eat more fiber, most Americans do not eat much 
whole-wheat bread, fresh fruit or broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
The cholesterol news notwithstanding, the hamburger remains the fast-food 
favorite and fried potatoes the most popular side dish. The best-selling 
supermarket vegetable remains the tomato -- usually gassed and rock hard -- 
with iceberg lettuce the most popular (and least nutritious leafy green. Fewer 
than half of us have even tried frozen yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Why, one cannot help asking, given all that we've heard about health and 
nutrition, have most Americans been slow to change? What's at the root of this 
recalcitrance? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, self-identity. Eating is not a purely pragmatic act done just to 
satisfy taste buds or nutritional needs -- it's loaded with social and 
emotional meanings. You are, after all, what you eat -- or, perhaps more to the 
point, you are what's on your plate. 
</P>
<P>
This sentiment, behind some of the odder entries on chic healthy gourmet menus, 
works both ways. Flaunting hard-guts bravado, some people may enjoy appearing 
indifferent to danger. Before the counterculture went organic in the late 1960s 
-- the roots of healthy gourmet cuisine -- Bohemians often dismissed health as 
boring and bourgeois. Similarly, in the mid-1980s, some young punks derisively 
associated natural food with the older Woodstock generation. 
</P>
<P>
Less consciously rebellious -- and more pervasive -- is the feeling that 
healthy food probably tastes bad. According to nutritional anthropologist Norge 
Jerome of the University of Kansas Medical Center, many people distinguish 
between food and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Food should taste good, while nutrition is good for you but not much fun. For 
good taste, American standard favors consistency, bright colors and lots of 
crispy fat, salt and sugar. Nutrition, however, is associated with bad-tasting 
pills, slimy greens, weird organ meats and nuts and twigs. So ingrained is this 
perception that many old-school food-industry executives believe that the worst 
thing that can be said about a product is that it's good for you. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding such skepticism is considerable confusion about what is good for 
you. To the average skimmer of health news it may seem that just about 
everything causes cancer or heart disease. Worse, the experts seem constantly 
to be changing their minds -- so why bother at all? 
</P>
<P>
After a rash of findings concerning cholesterol, The Washington Post's Meg 
Greenfield blamed her nutritional nihilism on the "They Institute of America." 
First "they" told us to eat lots of milk, eggs and meat, then "they" told us to 
eat less of that and more fish, but then "they" told us to eat less fatty fish 
(due to mercury), and now "they" were telling us that the fattiest fish might 
reduce cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing lasts," Greenfield lamented. "No assertion has a shelf life of more 
than 11 months." 
</P>
<P>
Soon they would be telling us to eat more bacon, eggs and Twinkies -- with 
extra salt. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the experts have been more consistent than Greenfield allows. The 
problems come from the things "they" don't know enough about yet -- 
particularly all the recently added chemicals that haven't been adequately 
tested. But it's no wonder it seems we're doomed if we do, doomed if we don't. 
</P>
<P>
Other longer-running gender, ethnic and class patterns also play a part in the 
longevity of American standard. On the whole, men tend to be less 
health-conscious, perhaps because diet-related professions -- especially 
nutritional science and home economics -- were feminized in the late 19th 
Century, thereby relegating them to marginal status in a patriarchal culture. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in many working-class and ethnic subcultures, women subordinate their 
own nutritional concerns to the tastes of their husbands and children; it is a 
form of gift-giving to serve a favored but unhealthy food, say, frankfurters 
and chips or barbecued ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, in his book, "Distinction: A Social Critique of 
the Judgment of Taste," further suggests that working-class people may be less 
likely than the more affluent to defer gratification -- to eat salad rather 
than sirloin -- because they have a more pessimistic appraisal of the future. 
People from poor backgrounds may prefer the foods that show you're better off 
than your forebears: refined flour, white sugar (long a symbol of the "sweet 
life"), fats (as in "fat cat" and "fat of the land") and meat, especially 
well-marbled Prime beef. But the most obvious class variable is price. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy food is generally more expensive than the basic supermarket variety. 
But the reasons for this higher cost aren't so obvious. Why, after all, should 
a free-range chicken that scrounges for bugs in a farmyard cost more than the 
standard one stuffed with expensive feed grains, hormones and antibiotics? Why 
should a locally grown organic tomato cost more than one nurtured in chemically 
treated soil, sprayed with pesticides, wrapped in protective foam and then 
trucked in from Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that healthy supplies have not kept up with growing 
demand. Perhaps more important, our supposedly inexpensive standard food does 
not begin to reflect the full social, medical and ecological costs of its 
production: the damage to soil, ground water and farm workers; the damage to 
rural culture as family farmers and supportive small towns lose out to 
corporate growers with no local ties; and the drain on the federal budget from 
massive price supports. Without government irrigation subsidies, a pound of 
hamburger might cost $35. Granted, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is 
rethinking its policies that encourage use of fertilizers and pesticides. But 
in the meantime, American standard seems cheaper because all the 
"externalities" are left off the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting this price differential, demographic and psycho-graphic surveys show 
that affluent people do read food labels, worry about pesticides, buy exercise 
machines, count calories, order flounder instead of roast beef, smoke less, buy 
natural foods, ponder organic produce and like broccoli, shiitakes, chevre and, 
yes, even arugula. To be sure, not every upper-middle-class person is a healthy 
gourmet nut -- but most of them seem at least partly aware of the trends and 
try to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
Like their counterculture predecessors who ate granola not just to save the 
world but also because it was exotic and adventurous, today's defectors from 
mainstream cuisine have complex, even contradictory goals. Consider the dual 
nature of healthy gourmet food: "lite" but rich. 
</P>
<P>
On the healthy side, it fits the current lean and green formula. Small portions 
limit calories -- the principle that has made frozen diet entrees such a growth 
industry for the food business. To keep the cardiologists happy, olive oil, 
yogurt and lime replace butter, cream and salt. Free-range chickens and 
grass-fed "designer" beef have less fat, antibiotics and hormones; they also 
may be raised under better conditions. The wild greens and baby vegetables are 
high in nutrients and fiber. Produce is seasonal, regional and, ideally, 
organic -- grown without pesticides and chemical fertilizers. In short, the 
cuisine tries to be "lite," not just on the body but also on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
What the food lacks in bulk it makes up in aesthetic density: a concentrated 
clash of textures, flavors and styles. This is culinary jet-setting, with 
dishes leaping continents in a single bound. But this is not ethnic fare, with 
its steamy street fairs, finger foods and one-pot camaraderie. Nor is it truly 
populist -- as in the quintessential sub-and-fries of the best American 
standard lunch counters. Rather, this is quieter and cooler, closer to James 
Beard than to Calvin Trillin, more distanced, self-conscious and tasteful; 
i.e., gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
To an extent, this gourmet aura helps to reduce uncertainty about which foods 
are good for you. After all, one way consumers seek security is to pay more for 
something. While seeming to guarantee quality, the gourmet imprimatur also 
overcomes the healthy vs. tasty dichotomy, for the food that carries it usually 
does taste good. Yet, with its dizzying and disjointed array of historical, 
geographical and cultural references, the nouvelle menu probably exacerbates 
the current confusion. What better evidence than those thick, creamy desserts 
that food people scarf down after dutifully taking their greens and mineral 
water? 
</P>
<P>
Given all of these conflicts, backlash seems inevitable; indeed, it's already 
here -- at those ubiquitous retro-diners serving up meat loaf and mashed 
potatoes, half-pound hamburgers and thick malts, often at exorbitant prices, to 
the same upscale customers who the week before were eating mahi-mahi and baby 
artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
Aching for the "innocent" certainties of the 1950s, chic meat-loafers yearn to 
stop worrying about bacon grease, white sugar, maraschino cherries, artificial 
coloring, processed American cheese and other junk food cliches of the time 
when Ronald Reagan hosted "General Electric Theater" (1954-1962). In this 
culinary version of the Reaganesque suspension of disbelief, they dream of a 
time before Ralph Nader, George McGovern and the hippies messed everything up. 
Maybe you can go home again -- or at least eat your way there. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, as Jane and Michael Stern imply in their book, "Square Meals," canned 
mushroom soup did make "the perfect tuna casserole," oven-fried corn-flake 
chicken was wholesome and Jell-O was the "chef's magic powder." If you were 
nine years old in 1956, life was simpler, the menu options fewer but more 
substantial. So don't graze the tapas, just order the pot roast and potatoes. 
Indeed, why go out at all when you can stay home, microwave a Chef Boy-ar-dee 
and cocoon in front of Donna Reed reruns? 
</P>
<P>
The diner craze does not bode well for those who fantasize about starting some 
intimate California cuisine-style bistro. A better bet for future restaurateurs 
may be to open a version of the American Standard cafe. But forget the 
Mom-and-Pop lunchroom kind, which was a lot of work and, in this day of food 
conglomerates, is probably doomed anyway. And forget the retro-diner too, which 
is a bit too cute and self-conscious to stay in vogue very long. Instead, 
would-be culinary entrepreneurs might consider borrowing the franchise fee and 
signing on with McDonald's, the meat and potato people. 
</P>
<P>
If you're really serious about food reform, you needn't lose heart, however, 
for revolutions are never made in restaurants anyway. There are big changes 
underway out there, literally at the grass roots -- at all those newly 
converted organic farms dotting the landscape of Pennsylvania, Texas, even 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
But that's another story. . . .

MORNING BRIEFING: SOONER OR LATER, LONGHORNS WILL MAKE THEM NOTICE PUNCH 
</P>

<P>
Basketball player Joey Wright of the University of Texas didn't know what hit 
him in the opening moments of a 103-84 loss to Oklahoma in Norman, Okla., last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Wright says he took a blow to the mouth, but thought it was merely the result 
of an inadvertent elbow. But a tape of the game shows Oklahoma's Terry Evans 
punching Wright. Officials didn't see the punch, either. 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew what happened, we would have cleared the benches," Wright said. "I 
never saw the punch until I looked at the tape. But I felt it. I thought he 
slipped in an elbow, but it was an outright punch in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any action that could be taken, Jamie Ciampaglio, a Texas 
assistant coach, said, "Not until next year." 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners the Longhorns will play in Austin, Tex., next season. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was the NBA, the tape would be reviewed and the player would be fined 
and suspended," Texas Coach Tom Penders said. "Here, there is no one to send it 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Whose interception on the last play of the game Jan. 18, 1976, 
ensured the Pittsburgh Steelers' 21-17 Super Bowl victory over the Dallas 
Cowboys? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to prove: The Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan, on plans for a 
pay-per-view one-on-one game against the Lakers' Magic Johnson, an idea the NBA 
has vetoed: "Who cares who can beat another player one on one? Magic's been 
known as an all-around player his whole career. I've been labeled a little bit 
as a one-on-one player and I'm trying to shed that label as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of fans would love to see it mainly because of the status we 
carry in the NBA. But I don't know if that's a fair match. Me against Dominique 
(Wilkins) would probably be more fair. But I'm not trying to start anything 
else, now." 
</P>
<P>
Add NBA: The Celtics' Kevin McHale, denying that he is the source of 
unattributed criticism of teammate Larry Bird, told the Boston Herald: 
"Harmony, scharmony. I'm not a symphony director. Life is too short to say 
anything negative about anyone. I've never been a person to say anything 
negative about a teammate or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Lethal weapon: Dale Brown, basketball coach at Louisiana State, and Kentucky 
counterpart Rick Pitino nearly came to blows during Saturday night's game at 
Baton Rouge, La. Pitino said a couple of days later that he was not concerned 
about squaring off with Brown -- "unless he wanted to fight me with his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Add LSU: Vanderbilt's first-year coach, Eddie Fogler, on the LSU lineup that 
includes 7-footers Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts and high-scoring point 
guard Chris Jackson: "They have three (NBA draft) lottery picks. Do you know 
any other team in the country that has three lottery picks? I don't know if 
there's another team in America that has two." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Glen Edwards.

STOCKTON, 3 OTHERS SHARE LEAD;

<P>
GOLF: POOLEY, COOK, FUNK ALSO SHOOT 65 IN FIRST ROUND OF 90-HOLE BOB HOPE 
CLASSIC.

<P>
Two veterans, a relative newcomer and a player who is making a comeback after 
extensive hand surgery shared the first-round lead Wednesday in the $1-million 
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stockton, Don Pooley, Fred Funk and John Cook each shot a 65, seven under 
par, on an alternately cloudy and sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
It rained here early Wednesday morning, but not enough to delay the first round 
of the five-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Benepe and Hale Irwin were only a shot behind the leaders, and 13 players 
were grouped at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton, a two-time PGA champion who plays only a limited number of tour 
events while concentrating on corporate outings, got his 65 at Tamarisk. He 
birdied the first four holes, had a 30 on the front side and got a bogey and 
two birdies on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
It was a gratifying start for Stockton, a former USC star who shot an 80 in his 
opening round of the Tucson Open last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five is a familiar number for Stockton. He had that score for the sole 
first-round lead in the AT &amp; T Pebble Beach Pro-Am a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton said he was upset about his 80 at Tucson and spent the weekend working 
on his game with his sons, David and Ron, who play on the USC golf team. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron will really be excited," Stockton said. "He has helped me. He knows my 
game and swing." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Stockton is a freshman at USC. David, a junior, finished second in the NCAA 
tournament last year. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton plans to play five of the first seven tournaments this year and a 
total of about 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 48 so I've got two years before I can play on a tour that I'm supposed to 
be able to play on," Stockton said, referring to the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
But Stockton says he'll be confronted with a delightful conflict when he's 
eligible to join the seniors. He still wants to maintain his financially 
rewarding corporate outings, of which he played more than 90 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really good," he said of the corporate outings. "There are no kids and no 
cuts and I'm low pro every day. And I get top dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Stockton was hampered by bone spurs in his neck last year, but after reading a 
book dealing with mind over matter he said his neck problems diminished. 
</P>
<P>
He takes part of the year off for hunting and fishing, and the respite from 
golf apparently revitalizes him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how much better my sense of humor becomes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who shot his 65 at Indian Wells, needed a sense of humor last year. 
</P>
<P>
What was believed to be tendinitis in his right hand has pained him since 1982. 
It was finally learned that he had, at some time, suffered a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
So he had surgery to relocate a tendon and to remove tiny pieces of bone that 
had broken away. He didn't return to competition until the Isuzu Kapalua 
tournament in Hawaii last November. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of taking aspirin," said Cook, who played his junior golf in 
Southern California and has been on the tour since 1979. "I'd soak my hand in 
the morning because I couldn't even make a fist when I got up." 
</P>
<P>
Cook was aware that his hand problem was more severe than tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a big bump on my hand and I knew it wasn't a cyst," he said. "I'd have a 
real good week on the tour, then I'd have an awful week." 
</P>
<P>
Cook was able to compete in only 12 tournaments in 1989 because of the hand 
injury and subsequent surgery. Now he says he's playing free of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Funk, who shot his 65 at the Palmer course at PGA West, is a former University 
of Maryland golf coach. Last year was his first on the tour.

The 33-year-old Funk, who finished 157th on the money-winning list last year, 
earning $59,695, said life on the tour wasn't as glamorous as he had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big learning experience," he said. "The travel was a lot harder than 
I thought it would be. It was a grind and living out of hotels gets old." 
</P>
<P>
Funk had to finish no lower than 125th on the money winning list to be exempt 
for another year on the tour. He didn't, so he went back to qualifying school 
and finished ninth, earning another year on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he will persevere for another two or three years to see what he 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
Funk was obviously pleased with his bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
Pooley, 38, was similarly pleased with his 65 at Indian Wells, saying, "I 
wasn't in serious trouble all day, striking the ball, or putting." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
The players said the courses were in excellent condition and they took 
advantage of them. There were 93 sub-par rounds by the 128 players. . . . Among 
those grouped at 67 were Mark Calcavecchia, Jeff Sluman, Fred Couples, Bob 
Tway, Jodie Mudd, Peter Jacobsen and Andy Bean. . . . Sluman, as John Cook, is 
making a comeback this season after an appendectomy last May and unrelated back 
problems. He said he is only 80-85% physically fit now, but expects to be 100% 
in a month or six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Steve Jones, who has been bothered by a pulled muscle in his 
neck, shot a three-over 75 at Bermuda Dunes. . . . Tom Watson, who has a 
corrected swing and an adjusted putting stroke, had a 70 at Bermuda Dunes. Tom 
Kite, the PGA player of the year in 1989, also had a 70 at the same course. . . 
. Lee Trevino shot a 69 at Bermuda Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Palmer had a 73, also at Bermuda Dunes.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't walk under a ladder. Don't let a black cat cross your path. Don't crack a 
mirror. And don't play for the Los Angeles Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper is headed for surgery instead of the NBA All-Star game and it is 
time for General Manager Elgin Baylor to unload some of those four future 
first-round draft choices in a trade that still could salvage a playoff berth 
for the world's unluckiest basketball team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A Jeff Malone or a Danny Ainge might be available. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that the boys of winter have begun working out at Dodger Stadium, we'll 
save Tom Lasorda the bother of making out his opening-day lineup card: Juan 
Samuel, cf; Willie Randolph, 2b; Kal Daniels, rf; Kirk Gibson, lf; Eddie 
Murray, 1b; Hubie Brooks, 3b; Mike Scioscia, c; Alfredo Griffin, ss; Orel 
Hershiser, p. . . Clearly, here is a team that will finish anywhere from first 
to fifth in the National League West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Daniels says he wants to bat third. We'll grant him his wish because Gibson 
will make a fine cleanup man. Of course, all this is based on the complete 
cooperation of their knees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A record crowd for college basketball, 65,000, is expected at the Louisiana 
Superdome Saturday for the LSU-Notre Dame game. All proceeds will go to the 
homeless through Comic Relief. Coach Dale Brown sold two seats on the LSU bench 
for $5,000 apiece and even the promoter, Sonny Vaccaro of Pacific Palisades, 
paid for his dozen tickets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The key to beating Oklahoma is to get the Sooners into a half-court game. They 
didn't know what to do against Lon Kruger's well-coached Kansas State Wildcats 
the other night in the Little Apple of Manhattan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My favorite sports nickname of all-time remains that of former Temple 
basketball star Bill Mlkvy, the Owl Without a Vowel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
They're not twins, but Chuck Robinson, Terence Mullin and Eddie Bird are dead 
ringers for their famous older brothers, David, Chris and Larry. They also play 
basketball for their brothers' old schools -- Navy, St. John's and Indiana 
State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I don't miss the old NFL Playoff Bowl, which used to match the losers 
of the Western and Eastern Conference championship games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker's last ride may not be the only highlight of the Feb. 3 card at 
Santa Anita. Akinemod and Gorgeous, talented 4-year-old fillies, are expected 
to race in the 1 1/8-mile La Canada Stakes that afternoon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Good news for Jack Nicholson. The Academy Awards, March 26, don't conflict with 
the NCAA basketball championship, April 2, this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac is quickly making friends at the Forum. During the Martin Luther 
King Day matinee against Sacramento, the rookie Laker center scored a basket 
and then low-fived a young girl sitting in the front row. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Neil Lomax and Ted Danson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is interested in Kip Keino's son Martin, who attends Fork Union Military 
Academy in Virginia, and will run the prep mile in the Sunkist meet Friday at 
the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Comedy Night. Batting Helmet Day. Movie Day. Ice Cream Day. Wrist Band Day. 
Date Night. Baseball Cap Day. Beach Party Day. A list of Dodgers' promotions? 
No. All these events are planned for Dedeaux Field on the USC campus, where the 
Trojans will try to uphold their preseason No. 1 baseball ranking by Baseball 
America. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three world record-holders -- Janet Evans, David Wharton and Mike Barrowman -- 
will compete in a double dual meet featuring the USC women against Stanford and 
the men against Michigan Friday at 1 p.m. at the McDonald's Olympic swim 
stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC safety Mark Carrier made a big hit in Oklahoma City when he accepted the 
Jim Thorpe Award wearing a tuxedo, black cowboy hat and snakeskin boots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's uncertain whether Carrier will opt for the NFL draft as a junior, but 
probable that teammate Junior Seau will leave early. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bob Halloran, the director of boxing at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, wants to 
make a Michael Nunn-Thomas Hearns match. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose, who was honored at Cappy Harada's annual Hot Stove League Golf 
Tournament in Santa Maria last week, donated the $5,000 check he was awarded to 
Hancock College in Santa Maria. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two intermissions in hockey are one too many. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What is important to know about the NHL All-Star telecast Sunday on NBC is that 
Wayne Gretzky will play for the Campbell Conference and Mario Lemieux for the 
Wales. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson was spotted in an Orange County theater watching "Glory," the day 
after his football team fell short of it in San Francisco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The next time you see a 19-year-old college kid sink two free throws with 
thousands screaming, think about the veteran pro golfers who step away from a 
putt if they hear the click of a camera.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
ISLANDERS DEFEAT CANADIENS TO MOVE INTO A TIE FOR FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The amazing turnaround of the New York Islanders continued Wednesday night as 
they skated to a 6-3 victory at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
David Volek scored twice as the Islanders won their eighth in a row and moved 
into a tie with New Jersey for first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders opened the season with only five victories in the first 26 games 
and people were wondering if Al Arbour, who coached the Islanders to four 
Stanley Cups in the '70s, had lost his touch. 
</P>
<P>
The patience of Arbour has paid off as the Islanders have won 13 of their last 
14 games to go over .500. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Islanders won eight in a row was in October, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In seven weeks they have gone from last to first. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 5, Boston 5 -- The Bruins rallied from a 4-3 deficit early in the 
final period at Hartford, Conn., to take the lead, but the game was 17 seconds 
too long for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much time remained when Kevin Dineen beat goaltender Andy Moog from 
the slot with his 16th goal. 
</P>
<P>
In the see-saw game the Whalers fell behind early, 3-0, before scoring four in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Ray Bourque scored twice for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Minnesota 1 -- The Blackhawks have trouble against good teams from 
the other divisions, but in the Norris Division, they are the team in control. 
</P>
<P>
With Jacques Cloutier stopping 25 shots, Chicago rebounded from two poor 
outings to increase its division lead to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 6, Winnipeg 3 -- After their hot streak moved them into the race in 
the Smythe Division, the Jets have lost their last two games. 
</P>
<P>
After losing at home to Quebec Tuesday night, they were never in the game at 
Edmonton. The Oilers lead the division by two points. DAN HAFNER

ASCOT PARK TO OPEN FINAL YEAR WITH SPRINT CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news at the start of a new racing decade is that Ascot Park, the 
busiest weekly race track in the country, is programmed to remain open 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that 1990 will be the last for the old track that has been 
operating near the Gardena city limits since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot will open its 33rd season the weekend of Feb. 23-24 with the Midwinter 
Sprint Car championships, featuring the nomadic World of Outlaws and their 
winged sprinters. The Outlaws lost several of their most impressive talents 
last year to the newly formed United Sprint Assn., but Ascot stuck with the 
older organization. 
</P>
<P>
After a year, the USA folded its hand, so the Outlaws will return to Ascot with 
Steve Kinser, a nine-time champion, who rejoined the Outlaws. He had been one 
of the leaders in the unsuccessful revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The California Racing Assn., which makes Ascot its headquarters for the 
wingless sprint cars, will open its final Ascot season March 17. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case for as long as Ascot has been open, promoter Cary 
Agajanian and his staff will have nightly fares of motorcycle racing -- flat 
track, motocross and speedway -- as well as stock car, sprint car, midget and 
jalopy racing. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the day when Ascot's dirt oval will be unavailable, the CRA 
will open its season Feb. 11 with a pavement race at Mesa Marin Raceway in 
Bakersfield. Defending champion Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., was the first 
entry. Once again, he will be driving the legendary Tamale Wagon for the 
Morales Racing Team, headed by Andy Morales, whose late father, Alex, started 
the team 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 motor racing season will get under way locally Saturday night at 
Anaheim Stadium with the fourth annual Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship 
Gran Prix, opening event of a 10-race stadium series. 
</P>
<P>
Main interest in the series revolves around the Grand National sports truck 
class, in which defending champion Robby Gordon has switched from Toyota to 
Ford. Gordon will be replaced on the Toyota team by Jeff Huber, who won the 
1987 title driving a Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
Another addition to the truck lineup is Roger Mears Jr., son of the 1985 
champion, who will drive a second Nissan as a teammate of his father. Young 
Mears was rookie of the year last season, driving in the Super 1600 class. 
</P>
<P>
A new course has been laid down inside the Anaheim Stadium that features seven 
turns and five jumps. Competitors in the six classes will also encounter the 
split-lane concept introduced to stadium racing at the Coliseum last June in 
which drivers can choose between an easier but longer course and a rougher, 
shorter one around the tight circuit. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Jan. 27, motocross will be the main event at Anaheim Stadium 
where the Coors Extra Gold Super Challenge will be the curtain-raiser for the 
Camel Supercross season. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of more than 60,000 are expected for both Anaheim events. 
</P>
<P>
INDY CARS -- A. J. Foyt and Eddie Cheever, a former Formula One driver who is 
embarking on a CART career with car owner Chip Ganassi, have been added to the 
list of drivers who will have Ilmor Chevrolet Indy V-8 engines this season. 
</P>
<P>
FORMULA ONE -- The first day of practice and qualifying for the Phoenix Grand 
Prix on March 9 will be free to the public. A Trans-Am championship race on 
March 10 has been added to the street racing schedule, with the Grand Prix on 
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The G.F.I. Winter Series will continue Sunday at Los Angeles 
County Raceway in Palmdale. . . . The CRC will hold its monthly pro and amateur 
programs Sunday at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- Weekly racing at Los Angeles County Raceway, near Palmdale, will 
start Sunday with the first of nine Firestone ET series races. 
</P>
<P>
HALL OF FAME -- Twenty inaugural members have been inducted into the 
International Motosports Hall of Fame, which will be housed in a $500,000 
Unocal Museum adjacent to the Talladega (Ala.) Speedway. The list: Buck Baker, 
Jack Brabham, Sir Malcolm Campbell, Jim Clark, Mark Donohue, Juan Manuel 
Fangio, William H. G. France, Dan Gurney, Graham Hill, Tony Hulman, Junior 
Johnson, Parnelli Jones, Sterling Moss, Barney Oldfield, Lee Petty, Glenn 
(Fireball) Roberts, Jackie Stewart, Mickey Thompson, Bobby Unser and Smokey 
Yunick. Only retired drivers were eligible, which accounts for the absence of 
A. J. Foyt, Richard Petty and Don Garlits. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip has been named 
driver of the decade by the Sporting News. Waltrip won NASCAR's top prize in 
1981, 1982 and 1985, and also won the Daytona 500 in 1989. . . . Dan Press, 
1989 NASCAR Southwest Tour champion from Frazier Park, collected $7,550 in 
postseason awards to bring his season money winning to a record $46,135 for the 
All-American Challenge Series. 
</P>
<P>
NECROLOGY -- Mike Leon, the oldest active driver in off-road racing and owner 
of Mike's Sky Ranch resort in Baja California, and his wife were killed in a 
traffic accident last week en route to Tijuana. Leon, who would have been 70 on 
March 1, drove in the Baja 1000 last November. Mike's Sky Ranch is a familiar 
checkpoint and overnight stop for off-road racers about 100 miles southeast of 
Ensenada.

Anne Stalker is burned out. After toiling 11 years in the competitive real 
estate sales business, the Tustin resident says the desire is gone. She is 
looking for a new line of work to restore her career flame. 
</P>
<P>
The search brought her to the Embassy Suites Hotel in Santa Ana on Tuesday to 
an all-day sales and management "job fair." She was among more than 1,100 
people, armed with resumes and references, who came shopping for job 
opportunities offered by 48 companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for brighter horizons," said Stalker, as she filled out a form. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not she finds new employment, Stalker said the event -- sponsored by 
The Lendman Group, a professional job-fair organizing company -- is a big time 
saver, providing a broad mix of openings from a wide range of companies. There 
is no need for newspapers or headhunters. 
</P>
<P>
And as unemployment in San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles counties remains at a 
low level, more and more companies are turning to job fairs to attract new 
workers -- often hoping to lure the best qualified from their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Vari, chairperson of the Orange County Employment Managers Assn., 
estimates that nearly 20 job fairs with multiple corporate participants are 
held each year in or near Orange County. Close to 100 job fairs are scheduled 
by individual firms. 
</P>
<P>
Lendman Group, a consulting firm based in Virginia Beach, Va., which produces 
120 job fairs nationally each year, has scheduled a job fair for March 28 at 
Embassy Suites Hotel in La Jolla. Companies already signed up for the one-day 
event include General Binding Corp., Prudential Marketing Development, MCI 
Telecommunications and Donnelley Information Publishing, said Lendman Group 
Senior Vice President Joseph Di Geronimo. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hyland, Cerritos branch manger for Metropolitan Life, which is seeking to 
double its financial services sales force nationwide, said "bottom-line results 
are better" at job fairs because people who attend are generally serious about 
gaining new employment. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland and other interviewers at the Embassy Suites fair said that after an 
initial screening, they decide which applicants would fit into their companies 
and invite them back for additional interviews and tests. Some companies, 
however, don't like the competition of other firms at a job fair and prefer to 
hold job open houses at their offices or plants to attract applicants. MAI 
Basic Four, the Santa Ana computer company, held such an event last week in 
hopes of hiring some software engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the applicants visiting MAI were already employed. They were looking to 
upgrade their careers or find new employment in the wake or expectation of 
plant layoffs and closures. 
</P>
<P>
With the high cost of housing and other living expenses, many recruiters often 
find it easier to attract workers already living in Southern California. This 
saves on relocation expenses and avoids the difficult process of getting a 
candidate to move from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Fabian, vice president of human resources for MAI, said although that 
company also participates in professionally organized job fairs, open houses 
are preferable because "we can control the time we have it, the way we do it, 
and the interviewing process and we are not competing with 25 or more other 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
MAI carefully prepared for last week's job fair, which cost $10,000. Company 
managers rehearsed the swift and efficient processing of applicants. On the day 
of the event, each of 126 applicants who arrived between 4:30 and 8:30 p.m. was 
whisked through the process in about an hour. While waiting for interviews, 
they were treated to a buffet and watched videos about the company and its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The efficiency was meant to impress. And it did. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they handle this indicates the way they handle their business and 
their customers," said Pat Schilling, a software engineer who had been laid off 
from her job at another company just two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Employment specialists say the job-fair circuit tends to heat up in January.

JACK SMITH: PROTOCOL FOR CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF CELEBRITY KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My speculations on how to conduct oneself in a chance encounter with a 
celebrity have provoked various accounts of such experiences from readers. 
</P>
<P>
Such sightings are not as common as they were in the 1920s or 1930s, when one 
might bump into Clara Bow or Warner Baxter on Hollywood Boulevard, but the odds 
are still more in our favor here in Southern California than they would be, 
say, in Scott City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
My correspondents are divided on whether one ought to speak up -- perhaps even 
ask for an autograph -- or simply leave the celebrity alone in his or her 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Paul V. Newman writes that he has never tried to engage a celebrity in 
conversation, but he rather regrets those occasions when he might have as 
missed opportunities. Just recently, he says, he saw Diane Keaton at the Rose 
Bowl Swap Meet. "Now isn't that somebody you would enjoy chatting with?" 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to say that might interest Ms. Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Davis says that she and a schoolteacher friend, Bubbles, were in a 
Sherman Oaks restaurant when Marlon Brando and two friends came in and sat 
three tables away. After much indecision, Bubbles walked up to Brando and said, 
"Hi. My name is Bubbles and I'd like your autograph." Brando said, "I don't 
give autographs. It's against my religion." Bubbles said, "Well, I can 
certainly understand that. I'm Jewish." Whereupon Brando said, "Well, Bubbles, 
I'd like to shake your hand." And he did. 
</P>
<P>
That dialogue seems to me a bit of a non sequitur, but it probably makes more 
sense than the dialogue in most such encounters. 
</P>
<P>
Joan C. Bertolet of Rancho Palos Verdes recalls that in 1960 she saw Ray 
Milland in a Santa Maria drugstore. She first heard him asking the clerk for a 
cold remedy in his "splendid voice." She rounded a counter and recognized him 
instantly. "He was shorter than I had envisioned, and was causing the clerk to 
hyperventilate." Finally the clerk rang up his purchase and asked for his 
autograph. He replied, "Oh, my dear, I'm afraid I would give you my germs." Of 
course he couldn't have offered to shake her hand, for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 years ago, Midori Ohno of Glendora says, she found herself at the 
airport standing by an extraordinarily beautiful woman in a white dress with a 
white fur on her arm. She had just escaped a cluster of admirers and flashing 
cameras. She turned to Ohno. "Pardon me, did you happen to see a big, black car 
come by?" Ohno said she hadn't, but she hadn't been there long. "Oh, well," the 
woman said, "then they may not be here yet." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until she saw the woman's picture the next day that she realized she 
had talked with Sophia Loren. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Schreiber recalls the time in a Biloxi mess hall when Laraine Day served 
him a pork chop (he doesn't say why), and when Gen. George C. Marshall, with 
Anthony Eden at his side, asked his cadet formation if the chow was 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
He also recalls brief encounters with Van Cliburn, Peter Ustinov and Tony 
Randall. "It is possible that Tony Randall was mildly baffled when I decorously 
ignored him in the small Manhattan gallery where only the two of us scrutinized 
the collages. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth called such events 'spots of time,' " Schreiber says. "Joyce might 
have accepted them as 'epiphanies.' Small as they are, perhaps they make the 
world just a little more our own." 
</P>
<P>
One of my encounters-that-might-have-been also took place at LAX. I was walking 
with a photographer down the sidewalk in front of a terminal when I recognized 
a woman walking toward us, alone. She was Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
We had been there to interview some second-rate celebrity whose name I have 
forgotten. My heart skipped as I saw Ms. Hepburn. Without breaking stride she 
recognized us for what we were. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of ambushing her. She had no baggage. Evidently she had come to pick 
up a friend. Who? Spencer Tracy? I sensed a story. Hepburn was a very private 
person. Catching her off guard might make good copy. "Come on," I said to my 
photographer. "Let's leave her alone." 
</P>
<P>
Alas. It might have been an epiphany to remember.

* 'Governor Goofy' Replies: Newsweek called him "Minnesota's 'Governor Goofy,' 
" but Gov. Rudy Perpich says Minnesotans won't be swayed by the newsweekly 
article. On Tuesday, Perpich, a Democrat seeking reelection, dismissed the 
article in the Jan. 22 issue as a political attack orchestrated by Republican 
campaign consultant Roger Ailes, who was hired by Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Doug Kelley. Kelley and Newsweek denied that Ailes had anything to do 
with the article. As an example of Perpich's "iconoclasm," the magazine said 
Perpich once ordered all the coffee urns in the Statehouse unplugged to save 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
* Special Delivery: Cupid has a new message for lovers this Valentine's Day 
from Loveland, Colo. People around the world send their Valentines through the 
Loveland post office to get a verse on the special postmark. Ted Thompson, 85, 
has been coming up with verses since 1947. This year the verse is: "It might 
just be a song bird,/Or perhaps some sparkling dew,/That brings fond 
recollections,/And a timeless cupid too." 
</P>
<P>
* Second Thoughts: CBS anchorman Dan Rather says he has "no alibis, no excuses" 
for his one-time experiment with heroin. In the 1950s, Rather had a police 
employee in Houston inject him with heroin so he would better understand the 
drug for a story he was writing. Rather was in Baltimore Tuesday to address an 
anti-drug assembly for seventh-graders. 
</P>
<P>
* Video Search: When 4-year-old John Ross Cannon got a hug from Mickey Mouse at 
Disney World last April, it was a special moment, one of the last his family 
got to share with him before the child died of a brain tumor a month later. His 
parents, Larry and Tammy Cannon, have pictures to remember the moment, but they 
want something more. The Cannons are searching for several people with video 
cameras who may have captured the hug on tape. "I know there were a number of 
people there, shooting videos," Tammy Cannon said Tuesday in Charleston, S.C.

ART BUCHWALD: DRIVER IS HUNG UP ON CAR PHONE 
</P>

<TEXT>

Like so many people, Robert Shoun acquired a cellular phone in 1990. This came 
as a surprise to his friends because Shoun hates phones and he never answered 
his calls in the past. There is no doubt that Bob is enjoying his new toy. I 
know this because he called me four times in one day. 
</P>
<P>
"How is everything with you?" he wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a stupid question, Bob. Why are you calling?" 
</P>
<P>
"I got this new car phone and and I have to ring somebody." 
</P>
<P>
"You never telephoned when I needed you," I told him. "Now I hear from you all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bob sounded defensive. "Can I help it if I prefer to call from my car? I just 
don't like doing it from the office." 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to talk to someone, why don't you call your wife?" 
</P>
<P>
"She isn't taking my calls any more. She took her telephone off the hook two 
weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
"Surely you have some business buddies you can get in touch with," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do," he answered. "But most of them are putting me on hold. They figure 
anyone who calls from a car phone doesn't have much to do. Give me a break -- 
talk to me for the next three blocks." 
</P>
<P>
"I ran out of things to say after you went through a red light on K Street last 
week. Bob, you should have thought of how many people would answer your calls 
before you bought the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
"I did, but the ones I counted on let me down. You would think they'd be eager 
to converse with someone who was gridlocked in front of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
"They are, but sometimes your phone fades out on them, Bob, and that can be 
very annoying." 
</P>
<P>
"Who told you that my phone faded out?" Bob asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Kahme. He said that every time you ring him up, you pass a dead spot 
and he can't hear a word you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
"He's just making it up. I am known to everyone because of the clarity of my 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
"Bob, I have to go. Joe Califano is calling me from his car and he gets nervous 
when I leave him hanging." 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK with me. I'm going to be busy. I have to dial the weather service and 
then 911 and after that the 800 number to order cut-rate Pavarotti records." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be better off forgetting the phone and listening to your radio." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand. A cellular phone has to be used. I keep looking at it. I 
know that there is someone out there waiting to hear from me. Maybe I'll call 
information in San Antonio." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know anyone in San Antonio?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but it would be nice to find out how many Shouns live in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me, Bob. Have you ever made a call that couldn't wait until you reached 
the office?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so, but I've made many to people who were terribly impressed 
when they found out that I was calling from my car. Once you have a phone in 
your automobile, others respect you for who you really are." 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably true. Can I go now?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK, but you better take my car number if you get the urge to talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would I want to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
"To thank me for using AT&amp;T."

SPOTTING FAVORITES IN A LITERARY ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State of the Language edited by Christopher Ricks and Leonard Michaels 
(University of California Press, 531 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Opening this book is like opening the zoo gates to an impatient crowd. 
Sixty-two writers tumble in, each invited to put down thoughts about some 
aspect -- any aspect -- of the English language at the start of our century's 
last decade. Naturally they scatter, each to his favorite species, though the 
insectivorursus (bugbear) seems most popular. 
</P>
<P>
Each to his? Each to her? Each to his/her? Each to their? Predictably, 
language's conquests and casualties in the gender wars are a prominent theme. 
So is the language used to speak or write about AIDS. So are questions of 
language and race, language and class, language and the nature of reality. 
Literary reality, that is, and also real reality. 
</P>
<P>
These are the most political topics -- language as power -- and I will get back 
to them. But to get to them risks getting swallowed up by them -- this is an 
open zoo -- so before doing so, let me give an idea of the range and variety of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second "State of the Language." The first was edited 10 years ago by 
Christopher Ricks and Leonard Michaels, English writers and English teachers 
at, respectively, Boston University and Berkeley. It was a flaming success -- 
we seem as fascinated to know we are speaking English as Moliere's M. Jourdain 
was to know he was speaking prose -- and this new volume by 60 new writers is 
the result. Ricks and Michaels are repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
There are pieces, for example, on Australian English and graffiti English and 
one by Michael Bawtree suggesting that if the English opera tradition is 
relatively weak, it is in part because Shakespeare and others gave such glory 
to theater words that they refused subsequently to lie down and let the music 
upstage them. 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the contributions of Variety newspaper to the language: 
palooka, corny, blockbuster, deejay, among others. There is a piece on swear 
words by an Oxford don that has this reviewer trying to choose between "jocular 
ponderousness" and "ponderous jocularity." 
</P>
<P>
There is a piece on the use of pidgin in advertising in the South Seas. There 
are Wall Street folk terms for particular stocks: Kellogg is cornflakes; 
MacDonald's, we are told, is murderburger, and Simmons Mattress is American 
playground. I don't know if I believe this 100%, but I 100% want to. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pieces wander freely. M.F.K. Fisher writes of a pornography ring at 
her boarding school and Ted Hughes contributes a poem. An essay on poets' 
letters tells us that Anne Sexton, taken aback when a monk she was 
corresponding with said he was leaving the monastery and wanted to meet her, 
replied: "I feel I have somehow deceived you into thinking this is really a 
human relationship. It is a letter relationship between humans . . . " 
</P>
<P>
If words can deceive us into passion, they can also help us out of it. Ricks 
tells of smashing a window years ago in a marital dispute. A constable, 
summoned to the scene, was politely sympathetic: "We got a phone call, sir, 
telling us that someone has gone beresk." Suddenly, Ricks' misery lifted. That 
beresk got him well out of life and back in literature with Shakespeare's 
malaprop Dogberry. 
</P>
<P>
On to language as power. Our disputes about ideas and issues tend to become 
disputes about terminology. Like Humpty Dumpty we want the mastery over words 
in order to gain mastery over their meaning. As Michaels writes in his 
foreword, it is not so much a question of using language as of being used by 
it: 
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, it was considered very good luck to be used by English . . . 
There are now quite a few Englishes, and formerly colonized people may well 
prefer to get free of them and be used by their own language." 
</P>
<P>
David Dabydeen writes convincingly of the need for black writers in England to 
use their own kind of speech. A literary tradition in which an 18th-Century 
English poet was able to refer to plantation overseers as Master Swains, and to 
slaves as assistant planters clearly needs help. He gives a splendid quote from 
the Creole poet John Agard: 
</P>
<P>
"Dem accuse me of assault/on de Oxford dictionary/imagine a concise peaceful 
man like me," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I ent serving no jail sentence/I slashing suffix in self-defense/I bashing 
future wit present tense." 
</P>
<P>
Bashing the future with the present tense describes him perfectly. Several 
pieces refer to the terminology of AIDS. One writer notes the controversy over 
the term "AIDS victims." "People with AIDS" is preferred by many, as tending 
less to segregate the sufferers. Others object to this as linguistic cottage 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The feminist movement has provided the liveliest disputes. What does one do 
about the relative pronoun? The writer who sticks up for . . . his . . . her . 
. . their . . . his/her . . . convictions is to do what? Half a dozen essayists 
weigh in, none comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Anne Doody is spirited, in any case, when she objects to line-by-line 
combing-out of church hymnals. Taking out references to king and His risks 
turning the hymns to mush. Better to omit particularly objectionable stanzas, 
she argues, than to do so much rewriting that "we are invited to forget that 
our Christian forefathers and foremothers ever said anything that poses a 
problem."

ERMA BOMBECK: FIRING ADVICE RIGHT BACK AT MAGAZINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a working mother for the last 30 years, I still stop dead in my tracks when 
I read a headline, "How did Wanda Ferragamo do it? Build a $46-million shoe 
empire while bringing up six kids?" With all my heart I want to believe that 
Wanda had some magic timetable for balancing home and career, but the harsh 
reality is, she was probably heavily sedated. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers who work outside of the home are probably the most misunderstood women 
in the world. All you have to do is to leaf through the rash of magazines 
designed to target their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Do I really need to know it is time to move away from big boards and start 
trading over the counter? Am I motivated to share with my family the new 
recipes of the great chefs in executive dining rooms? Do I need help addressing 
the problem of becoming a fitnessaholic? 
</P>
<P>
Magazines that target baby boomers with careers act as if they've just 
discovered fire. The mothers who work today are no different than the mothers 
who worked 30 years ago. There are just more of them, and the terminology is a 
little different. 
</P>
<P>
I bonded when it meant ironing on a hem instead of using a needle and thread. 
Today it refers to children. Same guilt. In my day, stress was simply called 
kids. Is that all there is? translates to I want it all. Quality time to me 
meant hiding out in a bathroom that locked. 
</P>
<P>
I don't need to know if Wanda breaks out in hives when she reads about a great 
exercise mat for $35. I don't care if she tapes on her mirror 35 ways to tie a 
scarf and not make it look like a tourniquet. 
</P>
<P>
What I really need to know is what do you do when you're late for work, your 
preschooler throws up, your baby-sitter has the flu and your mother has an 
unlisted number? 
</P>
<P>
How do you keep it together when your child calls for the eighth time during 
dictation from the boss to announce his brother is bleeding again on the sofa 
that is not Scotchgarded? 
</P>
<P>
How do you cope when someone fed the last piece of bologna to the dog and the 
last piece of bread to the goldfish on a Sunday night when there are three 
lunches to pack? 
</P>
<P>
How do you put on damp panty hose and still walk with your knees together? 
</P>
<P>
How do you explain that on your resume under religion, you listed guilt? 
</P>
<P>
How do you get through to editors of these magazines that if you had time to 
read, you wouldn't need the advice in the first place?

Question: I have some Victor Red Seal records that have been in the family for 
years. How far back does the label go? -- T.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Eldridge Johnson, a name somewhat obscure in the history of 
music-related inventions, founded the Victor Record Co. shortly after the turn 
of the century. As it turned out, the firm became the predecessor of RCA 
Victor. 
</P>
<P>
More than two decades later, Johnson was bought out by Radio Corp. of America. 
During that time, Johnson's firm manufactured both phonographs and records, but 
it's the records that most collectors seek these days. 
</P>
<P>
The term "Red Seal" got started with Johnson's brainstorm to color-code his 
records -- he would assign colors to different kinds of recordings. Thus, "Red 
Seal" referred to special recordings made by well-known performers. 
</P>
<P>
In time, Victor's Red Seal label became synonymous with a product that was of 
top quality in terms of sound recording. (Actually, engineers and music experts 
reviewing the old Red Seal records have generally concluded that the sound 
quality probably wasn't much better than that of competing recording 
companies.) 
</P>
<P>
Few, if any, competitors could touch Johnson for the quality of his performers, 
which included some of the best of the time. One of those artists was Enrico 
Caruso, who in 1903 cut what is believed to be the first record to sell 1 
million copies. 
</P>
<P>
In the field of the phonographs, Johnson scored a real coup in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
That was the year Victor acquired rights to Nipper, the white fox terrier who 
listened quizzically to "His Master's Voice" coming out of the speaking horn of 
a Victrola. 
</P>
<P>
No product of the imagination, Nipper was a real dog whose British artist-owner 
painted the original likeness of his pet in the 1890s, along with the "His 
Master's Voice" message displayed in the painting. (The artist's name was 
Francis Barraud.) 
</P>
<P>
A variation of the Nipper design was sold in the 1890s to the Gramophone Corp. 
of Great Britain. Victor acquired the North American rights to Nipper in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
Nipper became an almost overnight success in terms of an advertising symbol. 
His image appeared on all Victrolas and Victor records and, right through World 
War II, a cardboard likeness of Nipper sat outside of thousands of record 
stores throughout the United States.

YOUR WHEELS: TIRE RATINGS CONFUSE TRUCK OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I am confused about tire sizes. I have a 4-wheel-drive pickup truck 
and wanted to buy a Michelin P225/75R15, rated for mud and snow. But the tire 
dealer said that tire wouldn't fit and that I should use a truck tire. Aren't 
they both the same size, if they are rated the same? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: In most respects the dimensions will be the same, though the truck tire 
probably carries a higher load rating than the passenger-car tire. 
</P>
<P>
As you probably know, the P identifies the tire as a tire for a passenger car. 
The 225 tells you that the tire is 225 millimeters in width. The 75 means the 
tire is 75% high as it is wide. 
</P>
<P>
All those dimensions will be the same regardless of whether the tire is P-rated 
or LT-rated for light truck. But some other things can differ. For example, the 
thickness of the tread can differ on some identically sized tires, meaning that 
the overall diameter of the tires differ. 
</P>
<P>
The other major difference will be in the load rating, or what the tire 
manufacturer recommends as the maximum load. The sidewall contains a load 
rating, expressed in pounds and kilograms. That's the maximum load it can carry 
at its maximum-rated air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
All of these factors and others are often wrapped up in the 
tire-performance-criteria specification number or TPC Spec, which is molded 
into the sidewalls of many tires. You can check the specification on your 
original tires and attempt to match it with your replacement tires. Otherwise, 
you can consult your owner's manual or the tire inflation sticker inside your 
car to determine the load rating your vehicle needs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My car, a 1981 Pontiac Le Mans, runs rough with a slight vibration. I was 
told by a mechanic that the problem stems from a vacuum leak. He said it could 
be anything from a loose hose connection to a faulty part. Is his diagnosis 
feasible? -- S.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: The diagnosis could be correct, but it is too vague. A vacuum leak almost 
anywhere in the maze of tubing that helps operate the emission control system 
on the engine could cause performance problems. A large number of valves and 
switches are designed to operate off vacuum pressure, and a leak could cause an 
improper fuel mixture being supplied to the engine or faulty exhaust-gas 
recirculation, among other problems. 
</P>
<P>
But your mechanic should be able to diagnose more precisely where the problem 
is occurring. If the only problem is a loose-fitting vacuum hose, then that 
should be easy to find. With the proper equipment and the on-board diagnostics, 
a vacuum leak should not develop into a wild-goose chase. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The owner's manual for my 1986 Honda Accord calls for a 20W-40 viscosity 
oil, which doesn't seem to me to be all that different from a 30W. It would be 
a lot cheaper to use the single-weight oil. Could I do that? -- D.H.F. 
</P>
<P>
A: The multiweight oil is of much higher quality, and you would be losing a lot 
of engine protection for not much savings in the cost of the oil. Today's 
multigrade oils are about 20% additives by volume, providing a significant 
boost in engine protection over the basic petroleum oil. By comparison, 
straight-weight oil is made up of about 7% additives. The multiweight oils also 
provide better protection in the critical few seconds after a cold start, when 
most engine wear occurs.

AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR HANDICAPPED OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed after-school care program for severely handicapped students won 
initial approval Tuesday from Glendale school officials, who heralded it as a 
breakthrough for parents. 
</P>
<P>
The program, the first of its kind in Glendale, will provide free care and 
innovative recreational instruction weekday afternoons for up to 24 mentally 
and physically impaired students from Glendale, Burbank and La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Easter Seal Society, the program could serve as a model to be 
duplicated nationwide, officials of the nonprofit organization said. Easter 
Seal already is considering creating a similar program in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make a big difference in the children's and parents' lives," 
said Mary Anne Dan, supervisor at College View School, a specialized facility 
for handicapped students that will house the program. "It's virtually 
impossible to find quality, affordable after-school care. And these kids have 
had few recreational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The state still must agree to fund and license the program as a day-care 
service. But Easter Seal officials, who said informal approval and funds 
already have been given, consider those measures largely procedural. 
</P>
<P>
The service is expected to be in operation no later than May, said Carlene 
Holden, Easter Seal's vice president of program service in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The after-school care proposal was praised by parents of College View students, 
who had struggled unsuccessfully for almost three years to establish such a 
service at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents have been unable to afford expensive, specialized aides or find 
day-care centers capable of providing proper care and have had to forgo working 
in the afternoons to look after their handicapped children, Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They really are at the cutting edge of something that's been a long-time 
need," said Don Eells, a La Crescenta training specialist whose handicapped son 
attends College View. "Something like this gives parents many more 
opportunities to lead a more normal life. Obviously it's very difficult to hold 
a regular job." 
</P>
<P>
But one handicapped services specialist cautioned that the program should be 
viewed only as a stepping stone to a better solution -- after-school care that 
would integrate normal and handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supporting the after-school program because right now there's a great 
need for it. But it's not the ideal situation," said Sam Suzuki, program 
manager for school-age children's services at Lanterman Regional Center, a 
nonprofit agency contracted by the state that will allocate the money for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Handicapped children are really best served when they are integrated with 
non-handicapped services," Suzuki said. "That's a direction we'll eventually 
go." 
</P>
<P>
But Board of Education members didn't hesitate Tuesday to embrace the program 
by agreeing to lease two classrooms at College View School for its operation. 
"It's a real breakthrough," one board member told Emmy Pennington, the 
district's director of special education, after she presented the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The program won quick approval from the board in part because it requires no 
school district funding, officials acknowledged. In fact, the district will 
receive about $20 a day for leasing the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Easter Seal and College View will hire and supervise at least four instructors 
and aides and may seek donations for student scholarships. But teachers' 
salaries, rent for the classrooms and students' costs largely will be paid by 
the state, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden would not disclose how much the program is expected to cost. But Dan 
said a proposed budget requests about $9.35 an hour per student. 
</P>
<P>
The program will emphasize recreation and interaction and provide therapeutic, 
specially designed toys for students that can be borrowed by parents for use at 
home, Holden said. It also will offer computerized work stations with adaptive 
equipment and programs that also can be borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about a baby-sitting program," Holden said. "We are talking 
about having a professionally staffed program with a lot of special features 
that are normally difficult to find. We're considering this a model program." 
</P>
<P>
Severely handicapped students, who attend either regular or special schools 
during the day, will be bused to College View and cared for from 3 p.m. to 6 
p.m., when their parents will pick them up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,800 students with various degrees of handicaps are enrolled in special 
education programs throughout Glendale, Burbank and La Crescenta, which operate 
a consortium to provide services for them, according to Pennington. About 100 
severely handicapped students attend College View. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program initially will be limited to 24 students, Dan said, 
immediate demand is not expected to be overwhelming because many handicapped 
students live in permanent care facilities outside their homes.

W. HOLLYWOOD TAKEN TO TASK FOR FAILINGS OF FOOD PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force report on a controversial program to feed the homeless blasted 
West Hollywood's government for "failure in foresight, planning, monitoring and 
decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
The report, presented to the City Council on Tuesday night by a task force 
formed to help relocate or revamp the Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition in 
Plummer Park, singled out the council and the Human Services Department for 
harsh criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The members of the task force . . . (have) concern that the council and the 
Department of Human Services are not up to the task of ameliorating the plight 
of the hungry and homeless while maintaining an adequate level of public health 
and safety," the report said. In particular, the report suggests that the city 
did little more than throw money at the program and neglected to weave into it 
any social service follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the program be dismantled and replaced by a meal 
voucher system with eligibility to be determined by local private human service 
organizations. The task force also recommended that the city limit spending on 
the program, set a cap of 100 to 125 participants and set general guidelines 
for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
By tying eligibility to participation in West Hollywood private social service 
agencies, the task force suggested that a food program could be geared toward 
"those trying to better their situation," said task force coordinator Mark 
Vandervelden, who is also Councilman Steve Schulte's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said the program had become a beacon for homeless from outside 
the city. "A contribution . . . to solving the problem of homelessness should 
not be to add to it," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly feeding of homeless on a first-come, first-serve basis has been 
supported for nearly three years by city funds. The previously little-known 
program was thrust into the public eye in October when the council voted to 
dismantle it in response to complaints from neighbors of Plummer Park. Angry 
residents had testified that participants were remaining in the area after 
eating, causing crime and sanitation problems. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department survey supported the claims, finding a concentration of 
crime in the area around the park. The department also said that many of the 
participants had outstanding felony warrants and that most were not from West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The October decision to end city support for the program brought to a November 
meeting a wave of Hollywood celebrities and advocates for the homeless who 
accused the city of insensitivity toward the homeless. At that meeting, the 
council reinstated the program for four months and created the task force to 
look into it. 
</P>
<P>
Most City Council members cautiously admitted this week that the task force 
made more progress in bringing together neighbors and coalition members in 
three months than the council had in more than a year of wrangling over the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force did what it was supposed to do," said Schulte, who provided a 
key vote in restoring the program last November. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte also accepted the report's criticism of city efforts, "In fact, in our 
efforts we did some harm, and we cannot duck that criticism. The report 
correctly puts the issue at the feet of the council and staff." 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Paul Brotzman and Director of Human Services Lloyd Long tried 
to deflect the criticism of city staff, saying they were only carrying out 
council policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The report picks on staff in many areas where it is not appropriate. We have 
suggested all along that there could be problems, but we were not directed to 
be a presence at the program," Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The final recommendations of the task force that the program should leave the 
park and we should come up with a voucher program . . . that is what we 
recommended back in November," said Long. 
</P>
<P>
The food coalition, which had been the target of much bitter criticism from 
Plummer Park neighbors, was largely exonerated by the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The coalition did what it was asked to do" when it served almost 150,000 meals 
to homeless in recent years, Vandervelden said. "Given its resources, to expect 
that (it) could serve as either social workers or police was unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition President Mike Dean, a member of the task force, approved the report, 
pushing the feeding program toward extinction. But he told the council Tuesday 
that his group could play an active role in raising funds to feed the homeless 
and identifying those in need. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is there, but it just has to be spent and administered in the right 
way. Human Services obviously can't handle this, and we don't want to see it 
get lost in the City Hall shuffle," Dean said. Brotzman and several council 
members were skeptical that a meal voucher program would work, because such a 
program would require that local restaurants accept the vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
Vandervelden admitted that meal vouchers have failed in other cities, but he 
prodded the council to give the task force until February to work out details. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Koretz, who has consistently supported the feeding program, 
said the recommendations are a good start: "This is the best solution I have 
heard so far." 
</P>
<P>
Under the voucher system, the focus would "shift from homelessness to hunger," 
Vandervelden said. He said groups for whom the Plummer Park program was not 
accessible, such as seniors, indigents and AIDS patients, would receive the 
primary benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The change in focus would seem to eliminate many of the current recipients. 
Under the current program, only intoxicated or disruptive people are not 
served. The task force noted that homeless people have threatened violence if 
their program is ended. But Dean said the food coalition will try to ensure 
that "those most in need will receive the benefit." 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed Tuesday to let the program continue in the park until at 
least March 6, when it was scheduled to end.

HOUSING CRUNCH HEADS OFFICIALS' LIST OF PROBLEMS 
</P>

Squeezed by spiraling real estate prices and low-paying jobs, Ventura County 
families are facing tougher times finding an affordable place to live, 
according to a study issued Wednesday by two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Local politicians, educators and business leaders polled by the United Way of 
Ventura County and the Ventura County Community Foundation said affordable 
housing is the most pressing need for area residents today, outranking crime, 
gang prevention and the need for AIDS care. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting to me that so many respondents identified affordable 
housing as such a leading concern," United Way President Laura McAvoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was designed as a gauge of community concerns, and not a 
recommendation for specific programs, but may be used by officials in planning 
programs when results are released in a 46-page report to agencies and business 
leaders around the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We seriously searched to find out these are the issues to prioritize that 
community leaders think are serious issues," said Alan Teague, president of the 
community foundation. "We have no cure for delinquency and gangs, but we now 
know that each town has problems with them. We're not trying to cough up all 
the answers, but we're hoping to define them." 
</P>
<P>
Those polled were asked to rank 47 concerns. In addition to affordable housing, 
those who responded targeted four other serious needs: prevention of 
delinquency, gangs, drug abuse and crime, as well as more programs for the 
mentally ill and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the issues defined by community leaders were problems felt primarily by 
the poor. As the poverty gap widens in the next 10 years, the report noted, 
senior citizens and minority groups will feel the lack of programs most keenly, 
particularly the Latino community, which makes up about 25% of the county's 
residents and is projected to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the information has already been useful, officials said. When the 
Ventura County Community Foundation decided to grant $35,500, some of it was 
earmarked for Latino youths, said Cathy Edge, executive director of the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the issues cited in the current survey reflect the same trends and data 
released in October, 1986, when the United Way issued its first report on 
needed programs in the county. Affordable housing was also considered one of 
the most serious concerns in that report. 
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of housing that low- and moderate-income people can afford to 
rent or buy is Ventura County's most widespread social problem," according to 
the 1986 report. 
</P>
<P>
But by last year, when the newest survey was conducted, little had changed. The 
predominance of low-paying jobs and booming real estate prices made it 
difficult for the poor to buy or to rent homes, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura was considered the second least affordable area for single-family 
housing in the state last year. As average prices of homes increased in 1989, 
according to the report, only 19% of the people living in the county could 
afford to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
The ranks of the homeless have also grown since the last report was issued. In 
1985, a United Way task force studying the homeless estimated that about 2,000 
people were living on the streets. Today, according to the report, the figure 
has more than doubled to about 4,500 homeless in the county. 
</P>
<P>
One city councilman said the survey results only confirm what he has already 
observed in his own community. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Perez, a councilman in Moorpark, where more than a third of the 
population is Latino, said many of his constituents are working poor, those who 
have jobs but cannot afford the mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
"The private sector really isn't addressing that sector of the housing market. 
It's really the upperscale home purchaser that has a lot to choose from. Land 
costs too much," Perez said.

Robert Nudelman can't get enough of Hollywood. The self-employed researcher has 
gone to 983 movies during the past three years. His favorite pastime: scanning 
the films for scenes shot in Hollywood, especially old buildings on Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It is little wonder then that Nudelman, 33, settled in the film capital when he 
moved to Los Angeles from Arizona 12 years ago. And, his friends say, it is 
little wonder that he is now the driving force behind a scrappy band of 
residents and merchants determined to keep the wrecking ball from altering the 
face and character of their tattered town. 
</P>
<P>
Doreet Hakman opened her first coffee shop in Hollywood in 1974, a decade after 
she and her family fled Romania with two suitcases in tow. The mother of four 
now runs the Snow White cafe on Hollywood Boulevard, which dates back to 1937, 
when the Walt Disney film of the same name premiered down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Hakman joined Nudelman's crusade because she worries that urban renewal will 
uproot the community's poorest residents, including many struggling emigres 
following in her footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Goulet bought into Hollywood four years ago, leaving her Western Avenue 
apartment for a 76-year-old house near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine 
Street. A grandmother and nutritionist, Goulet spends her spare time poring 
over legal notices about proposed construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet has joined the others for fear she might lose her home, which could be 
taken against her will by the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Nudelman, Hakman and Goulet are members of the Project Area Committee, the 
one-time official voice for Hollywood on issues concerning the city of Los 
Angeles' 3 1/2-year-old plan to redevelop the community. The $922-million 
renewal effort covers 1,100 acres in the core of Hollywood, including Mann's 
Chinese Theater, the Sunset-Gower Studios and many of the community's most 
historic buildings and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight months, the committee has been like a government in exile. 
The City Council disbanded the group last May after Hollywood-area Councilman 
Michael Woo, a strong advocate of redevelopment, complained that members were 
trying to undermine the revitalization effort. 
</P>
<P>
But committee members say they were just trying to protect the people of 
Hollywood and its historic buildings from a redevelopment plan bent on 
transforming their town into a high-rise jungle of steel and glass with little 
regard for the community's "heart and soul." Despite a judge's ruling upholding 
the committee's disbanding, 14 of the committee's 25 members continue to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember going through Europe when I was 10 years old," said Nudelman, who 
as chairman of the committee works about 40 hours a week on Hollywood matters. 
"You see all of those old buildings, and you see how groups had fought to keep 
them. Well, we are at a crossroads in Hollywood. We are deciding how much of 
Hollywood is going to be left for people to see 20 or 50 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
All of the committee members are volunteers who dig into their pockets to cover 
telephone, photocopying, transportation and mailing expenses. The committee 
lost its official meeting place last May, so it now convenes in the first-floor 
reading room at the Hollywood YWCA. The room is cramped and littered with dusty 
paperback books and curled magazines. But it is free. 
</P>
<P>
"We do our work on a shoestring, I am sure you can see that," said Goulet, the 
group's second-in-command. "We pass the hat when we remember. If we come up 
short, we call around and get some donations." 
</P>
<P>
The committee brings together an odd collection of community activists, 
homeowners, renters and merchants, and includes an actor, paralegal, 
nutritionist, photographer, housewife, two retirees, two teachers and several 
business owners. The 14 holdouts are united by a common disdain for Woo and the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, and a shared vision of a Hollywood free of both 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some committee members, who also belong to a residents group, Save Hollywood 
Our Town, have been at odds with the city over the redevelopment plan since it 
was adopted by the City Council in 1986. They claim that the plan was crafted 
with big-business interests in mind and have been locked in a protracted 
lawsuit with the city over whether the plan is legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee opens its meetings to the public, posts its agendas, sends press 
releases and forwards recommendations to the Redevelopment Agency. The monthly 
agenda routinely lists "CRA reports," even though the agency never sends a 
representative. It is important to keep things official, says Nudelman, who 
makes the report himself based on what he learns at agency meetings and "just 
asking around." 
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the committee has pushed to save a poor, residential 
neighborhood in central Hollywood recently rezoned for industrial use; have 
gotten involved in efforts to ensure that the owners of several historic 
buildings, including the Paramount and Holly theaters, properly restore their 
buildings; and last week voted to oppose a proposed new tax on commercial 
property near three planned Metro Rail stations in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is no one is officially listening. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be meeting and discussing redevelopment issues, and that is probably 
healthy," said H. Cooke Sunoo, who oversees Hollywood for the Redevelopment 
Agency. "The more discussion the better. . . . But if they are purporting to be 
advising the agency, they are failing miserably." 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment Agency officials say they are happy to be working with a new 
committee, the 38-member Hollywood Community Advisory Council appointed by Woo 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The new committee has a decidedly professional image. It meets in the 
seventh-floor conference room of the Redevelopment Agency's Sunset Boulevard 
offices, where walls are dotted with architectural drawings and renderings, and 
windows offer a panoramic view of Hollywood and the hills. Its membership 
includes architects, social service experts, corporate executives and community 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new committee members are Woo's friends and political supporters. 
All of them, Woo says unapologetically, share his enthusiasm for the 
redevelopment plan and serve at his discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"The advantage provided here is that it enables me to have a citizens advisory 
committee, which I will be able to work closely with," Woo said last year when 
announcing the new committee. "And I will be able to find panel members whose 
views on transportation or economic development or urban design are compatible 
with my own." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, about a dozen committee members were joined by nine staff 
members from the Redevelopment Agency and Woo's office. The agency's 
recommended work program for next year will include several suggestions from 
the committee, including funding for the historic preservation of homes and 
buildings, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have helped focus the direction of the agency," said Sunoo. "That is 
something the former (committee) had been totally unable to do. They bickered a 
great deal about internal procedures and were opposed to things, but didn't 
give us any constructive . . . direction." 
</P>
<P>
Nudelman and others say the new group has become a "rubber stamp" for Woo and 
the agency (they have dubbed it the "Vichy Project Area Committee"), but its 
members say cooperation should not be confused with compliance. 
</P>
<P>
The Project Area Committee members "are good people and they mean well, but 
they get involved in a lot of rhetoric and are very pessimistic," said Fares 
Wehbe, co-founder of the Hollywood Sentinels neighborhood organization and vice 
chairman of the new advisory group. "When we were having problems in our 
neighborhood, people said we weren't going to be able to change it. Well, our 
neighborhood did change. Rather than complain about the police, we went and 
worked with them. I think the same way about the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. We need to take an optimistic approach and make sure we use it as a 
vehicle to do things for the people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
Nudelman is a fixture at meetings of the new group's planning and design review 
committee, where agency officials discuss projects submitted by developers as 
well as long-range plans to upgrade Hollywood Boulevard and deal with vexing 
traffic problems. Some members of the official group welcome Nudelman and 
concede his outlawed committee still plays an important role. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a good sense of what the community is interested in," said architect 
and committee member Bruce Sternberg, who lives and works outside of Hollywood. 
"I am glad that they are there." 
</P>
<P>
The dual committees have created some confusion in Hollywood, particularly 
among developers. Some do not know which committee to court in their quest for 
approval of projects. Bewildered, they turn to Woo and the Redevelopment Agency 
for guidance. One developer agreed to talk to members of the renegade Project 
Area Committee, only to back out at the last minute when he learned they had 
been stripped of their official status. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the new advisory group worry that members of the Project Area 
Committee may attempt to thwart their plans for upgrading Hollywood Boulevard, 
expected to go to the agency's board of commissioners in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard plan will serve as the blueprint for development, governing 
everything from the width of sidewalks to the height of new buildings. The plan 
will need various city approvals and require public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't get this thing through, it will be very, very dispiriting," said 
Barton Myers, an architect on the new group who has consulted extensively with 
Nudelman over the past few months to ensure the outlawed committee's 
suggestions are not ignored. "The pressure is on everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he hopes time will heal the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I can compel them to not have meetings," he said about the 
Project Area Committee. "I would rather have the (two advisory groups) make 
amends somehow. . . . It is disappointing, but on the other hand, life goes 
on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Project Area Committee and the city will appear in court 
Wednesday to debate once again whether the Redevelopment Agency is required to 
consult with the disbanded group. Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled last 
month that the city could break ties with the committee. Committee members are 
hopeful the judge will change his mind when he looks at the evidence again. 
They contend his ruling was based on erroneous assumptions and a misreading of 
the record. Attorneys for the city defend the ruling. If the committee should 
lose again, members say they will appeal. But their attorney may recommend that 
they incorporate as a nonprofit group, a change that he said would not preclude 
them from remaining active in redevelopment issues.

MORE CITIES ENTER FRAY OVER PORT OF HUENEME; 
</P>
<P>
JURISDICTIONS: A STATE AGENCY DELAYS A DECISION ON WHETHER TO GIVE CONTROL OF 
THE FACILITY TO OXNARD AND PORT HUENEME. CHARGES AND COUNTERCHARGES FLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor commissioners charged this week that giving two local cities greater 
control over the Port of Hueneme could jeopardize the commission's attempts to 
gain more of the world trade market. 
</P>
<P>
But the city manager of Port Hueneme, which abuts the 80-acre port, argued that 
his city and Oxnard are fed up with a port government that continues to ignore 
their concerns about noise, traffic and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The charges and countercharges continued to fly as the Local Agency Formation 
Commission (LAFCO), in charge of county boundaries and special districts, 
postponed a decision on changing the boundaries of the Oxnard Harbor District, 
which governs the port. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-square-mile district now includes Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Camarillo, a 
portion of Thousand Oaks and some unincorporated areas of the county. Only one 
of the five harbor commissioners is from Oxnard. None lives in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme want to shrink the district by 70% so 
commissioners are elected only from their two cities, which they say bear most 
of the adverse effects from the port. 
</P>
<P>
But the current commissioners claim that the port affects all 630,000 county 
residents and should be governed by a seven-member body elected from the entire 
county. A countywide district also would increase the prestige of the port and 
help advance its plea for federal support. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cities around the county have entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Some contend that Oxnard and Port Hueneme want to control the port so they can 
raid its treasury and increase city funds. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard and Port Hueneme deny such accusations, saying that the current harbor 
commissioners don't care about their neighbors and are interested only in 
keeping their posts. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Camarillo and Moorpark -- and the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce -- have 
sided with current harbor commissioners. Simi Valley and Ojai, though, maintain 
that the district should be shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees, however, that the current district boundaries, drawn in 1937 
to conform to the Oxnard High School District, are useless. 
</P>
<P>
"The boundaries of the district are very capricious and arbitrary," said Bob 
Braitman, LAFCO's executive officer, who is expected to release a report 
favoring one of the proposals in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO recommended in 1972 and again in 1985 that the boundaries be changed to 
encompass the entire county. At those times, however, the required formal steps 
were not taken. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the cities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard made an unsuccessful bid to 
abolish the district and run the port themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the port and surrounding cities have been troubled at best, 
said Port Hueneme City Manager Dick Velthoen. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the port wants to maximize the port's opportunities at the expense 
of the local community," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
A $15,000 study commissioned by the two cities showed that Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme reap about 85% of the indirect economic rewards from the port. 
</P>
<P>
But they also pay for the roads damaged by passing trucks and the police and 
fire services used by the port. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1983 that the port entered into an agreement with Port Hueneme 
to pay a percentage of its $4-million gross annual revenues for road upkeep. 
Nonetheless, the port is unresponsive to city needs, Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The port hasn't done anything for the city or for Oxnard willingly without the 
threat of denial of a permit or a lawsuit," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
The port's executive director, Anthony Taormina, however, said he thought the 
relationship had been as amicable as ones between most neighboring 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
"While we've had disputes and differences of opinion, the results of the 
disputes have been resolved and gone forward," Taormina said. "I think all the 
parties will work together." 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought shrinking the district would hurt the port. 
</P>
<P>
"If we become a smaller entity, I'm afraid some regional aspects of the port 
won't be maintained," Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners concurred, questioning the ability of other people to run the 
port. 
</P>
<P>
"We're involved in trade in four continents," said Commissioner Ray Fletcher. 
"The present harbor commission is successful in increasing the port's revenue." 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Hueneme handles about 1% of the total tonnage of cargo that comes 
through the West Coast, mainly automobiles and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Taormina said he would like to see the port capture another 1% of the market -- 
1 million tons of cargo -- by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The port took preliminary steps last month to put in an automated 
cargo-transporting system that could spin off more than 2,000 jobs and bring 
about $530 million into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Omniport Hueneme would be one of five such computerized terminals in the 
nation. By increasing the port's ability to handle cargo, it would help 
increase the business the port could do, Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is also a bargaining chip in negotiations with U.S. Customs to grant 
the Port of Hueneme a Port of Entry status. Taormina, who returned last week 
from a working session with customs officials in Washington, said he is hopeful 
that the port will be granted the status by May. 
</P>
<P>
The status would designate federal funds for the port as well as increasing its 
prestige, thereby attracting more business, Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the port's pulling power and "compete on an even playing field," 
the port needs to increase its status, Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our change in status is perception," Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the port tries to forge ahead with plans for an international future, 
Taormina and the port commissioners face increasingly intransigent city 
officials in both Oxnard and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
If port government doesn't change, Port Hueneme's Velthoen bluntly warned that 
his city may exercise all the leverage it has. 
</P>
<P>
"Any expansion has to be approved by us," Velthoen said. "If the port is really 
going to grow, it's going to have to grow in concert with the cities."

6 TAKE OUT NOMINATION FORMS FOR LA CANADA COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six La Canada Flintridge residents have obtained nomination papers from the 
city clerk's office in the first week of the filing period for the City Council 
election April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 11, when the documents became available, the city clerk's office has 
provided forms to Elizabeth Blackwelder, Melvin Ricks, John Hastings, Gordon 
Breitman, Mayor Edmund Krause and Councilwoman Joan Feehan, according to City 
Clerk Pat Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Krause and Feehan, both incumbents whose four-year terms expire in April, 
announced their candidacies earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings was elected to the City Council in 1985 to fill a vacant seat and 
served as mayor pro tem in 1987. He and then-mayor J. Bixby Smith were defeated 
in their 1988 reelection bids in an acrimonious campaign that focused on 
accusations that the council was pro-growth and fiscally wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwelder is president of the La Canada Trails Council. Ricks is a dentist 
and Breitman is a physician, both with practices in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective candidates for the three council posts have until Feb. 1 to obtain 
signatures from at least 20 registered city voters and submit the paper work to 
the city clerk's office.

5 NAMED TO SAFETY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has appointed five members to the newly created Public Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was established last fall partially in response to frequent 
complaints that local sheriff's deputies had engaged in anti-gay behavior. 
Besides serving as a forum for citizen comments on law-enforcement issues, the 
panel will also deal with fire prevention and disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
The new members of the panel are: Christopher L. Fairchild, Aslan Brooke, Norma 
Kemper, Bronwen McGarva and John Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Greenstein, assistant to the city manager, said that the panel will 
probably meet once a month but that no official guidelines for its operation 
have been adopted.

Officials of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District are expected to 
appoint a 25-member committee to explore the possibility of establishing a high 
school in Malibu, a district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Karen Garot said the board of education received 47 applications 
from Malibu residents who are interested in serving on the committee. A 
three-member review panel is narrowing the candidates to the 25 that the board 
is expected to appoint Monday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the number of applicants to serve on the committee 
indicated the high level of interest in forming a high school in Malibu.

UCLA'S ROLE IN ECONOMY

UCLA and UCLA-related spending added about $4.4 billion and 70,000 jobs to 
Southern California's economy in fiscal year 1987-88, according to a report 
released by accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
That amount includes employee wages and benefits, purchase of goods and 
services, student expenses, payment of principal and interest, capital 
improvements, retiree benefits and programs funded by institutions closely 
linked to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The study also found that students spent more than $205 million off campus 
during 1987-88, most of it within 10 miles of campus.

AID FOR HOMELESS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mobile home offering "one-stop shopping" for homeless people in need of 
services will be in Venice until Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Program coordinator Patricia Huff said the "Mobile Ombudsman" trailer is 
staffed by representatives of local, state and federal agencies who are 
available to help needy people obtain aid. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer is parked at 685 N. Venice Blvd. at Pisani Street, where it is open 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ombudsman program is an outgrowth of an effort by City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter and the city's Community Development Department to bring services to 
homeless people camping out on Venice Beach two years ago, Huff said in a press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Mobile Ombudsman' program has been a very effective means of giving the 
homeless a chance to escape the streets," Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer remains in one location for about a month before moving. 
</P>
<P>
Huff said Pacific Telesis has provided the trailer with phones so needy people 
can check on housing, make appointments or check in with their families. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies on duty include the Veterans Administration, the Social Security 
Administration, the county Department of Public Social Services and the Mental 
Health Department.

NEW SATICOY BRIDGE DEMANDED

Warning that the Saticoy bridge spanning the Santa Clara River is in danger of 
collapse, a group of Saticoy businessmen, property owners and a Ventura City 
Council member have joined forces to hasten state efforts to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the bridge is safe and have the replacement project, which 
includes a new bridge and widening of California 118 through Saticoy, 
tentatively scheduled to begin in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the newly formed Saticoy Bridge Committee said this week that 
1992 is not soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing is just Mickey-Mousing around with this bridge. If that 
bridge goes down, someone is going to get hurt, just like the Oakland Bay 
Bridge," said Bill Martin, a Saticoy property owner and bridge committee 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the committee, which met for the first time Wednesday, plans to 
pressure state officials to keep the Saticoy bridge project in the forefront 
and is considering a lobbying trip to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Charles Davis, who runs a bakery and barbecue business along 
Wells Road, said the bridge is extensively cracked in many of the vertical pier 
supports and a bridge footing has been undermined, exposing several steel 
pilings that are driven 50 to 60 feet into the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a county resident for 43 years, said the bridge was weakened when it 
was damaged during a 1969 flood that washed out several other county bridges. 
He said the bridge has been patched up but not adequately repaired. 
</P>
<P>
But California Department of Transportation officials said this week that they 
have no fears about the bridge's immediate safety, although they acknowledge 
that it may be below standards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfectly safe," said Jack Hallin, chief of the local Caltrans project 
development branch. "Caltrans inspects every bridge on the state highway system 
every two years as a matter of course. The piles are not in any danger of being 
undermined." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Caltrans environmental report on the project states: "The bridge 
is structurally deficient as well as functionally obsolete. The footings are 
too high -- pile footings are exposed and subject to scour undermining the 
bridge. Decking is deficient -- barely adequate for legal loads." 
</P>
<P>
The study also specifies problematic expansion joints, cracked concrete 
surfaces and a metal beam guardrail that doesn't meet Federal Highway 
Administration requirements. It also says the bridge is too narrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Saticoy bridge is one of four bridges linking Ventura across the Santa 
Clara River to Oxnard and east Ventura County. It was built in 1912 but 
destroyed in a 1914 flood. The bridge washed out again in 1938 and was rebuilt 
in 1939. Major repairs were done in 1956, 1969, 1974 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans plans to build a new four-lane bridge and widen 1 1/2 miles of the 
highway along Los Angeles Avenue and Wells Road between Vineyard Avenue and the 
Santa Paula Freeway. California 118 will be diverted diagonally across the 
railroad tracks, bypassing downtown Saticoy, to link up with Wells Road, which 
will also be extended southward. 
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 cars and trucks use the route and bridge daily, according to 
Caltrans figures, last compiled in 1984. The count is the highest of any 
two-lane state highway in Ventura County and includes 14% truck traffic, 
according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and other committee members said Caltrans officials are ignoring the 
safety issue when they continue to delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a case against the safety of the bridge, but when it became prudent 
that plans be delayed they seem to take a laissez-faire attitude about it," 
said Ventura City Councilman Donald Villeneuve, who initiated the bridge 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said Caltrans first considered the project in 1984 and planned to have 
it finished this year. Now the construction, which has been subject to 
fluctuating state budgets, is not set to be completed until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, along with widening California 118 and California 23 through 
Moorpark, has been a long-term Caltrans goal but was delayed in 1985 because of 
a $300-million shortfall in the state's $5.3-billion highway project fund. 
Hallin said funds being shuttled to highways and bridges in the San Francisco 
region, damaged after the Oct. 17 earthquake, may delay other state projects 
but should not affect work on California 118 and the Saticoy bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said the state has $17 million set aside in its State Transportation 
Improvement Program for the Saticoy project but the funds are not specifically 
budgeted for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
Funding and the date of completion for the project will depend on the passage 
of a Senate committee bill in June. If signed into law, the bill will raise the 
Gann spending limit and allow a gas tax increase, which will provide additional 
funds for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hallin said if the bill is not passed, county projects may be delayed for 
several more years.

INCREASE IN SEWER FEES FACES NEW PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of La Crescenta homeowners, irate and confused over increased sewer 
fees, will stage still another protest next week even though the target of 
their anger, the Crescenta Valley County Water District, will not be 
represented at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The water district in September raised bimonthly sewer fees from $16.80 to $40 
-- a 138% increase. District officials said an elected board of directors 
deliberated for months before approving the increase to pay the community's 
$8-million share of improvements to the Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant in Los 
Angeles, mandated by federal and state directives. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials in November agreed to meet with homeowners this month 
to explain the reasons for rate increases levied last September and to discuss 
alternative methods of assessing the fees. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials said this week that they are not yet prepared to meet 
with homeowners because they are waiting for consultants to draft alternative 
proposals for paying off the district's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners complain that the water district is stalling. Marjorie Falloure, the 
64-year-old resident who single-handedly launched the protest in October, said 
she is going ahead with the meeting anyway, without the water district's 
participation. The meeting is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. next Thursday in the 
cafeteria at Crescenta Valley High School, 4400 Ramsdell Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Falloure said that although she is frustrated by the water board's delay, she 
is undaunted. "They thought they could shoo us off and we'd give up and that 
would be the end of it," she said. "But we are not discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters instead are threatening to form a homeowners' association to press 
their demands for a new rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
That action could jeopardize the autonomy of the Crescenta Valley Town Council, 
a quasi-governmental committee formed last spring to advise the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been warned by other communities that formation of two groups in our 
community would not be a good thing," said Crescenta Valley Councilman Don 
Hogue, who has been working closely with residents and the water district to 
resolve the sewer fee issue. 
</P>
<P>
Few residents were aware of the rate increase until bills were mailed in late 
October. Since then, there has been a outpouring of protest in the isolated 
community, where all users are assessed the same fee, regardless of the size of 
the household or the amount of water used. 
</P>
<P>
Robert K. Argenio, water district general manager, said the five-member board 
had decided that the flat rate is the most equitable of various methods. 
</P>
<P>
Falloure and a handful of followers -- mostly longtime residents who live on 
fixed incomes -- have urged the district to consider other alternatives, such 
as charges based on usage, bond financing or state grants. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have twice voiced their complaints before the Town Council, which 
adopted a resolution in December asking the water board to reconsider its 
action. Petitions gathered by Falloure's group and signed by more than 1,200 
persons were submitted with the council resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The water board does not plan to respond to the town council's questions until 
directors have had a chance "to review and clearly understand" the 
alternatives, Argenio said. "At that time, we will meet with the Town Council," 
he said, because the council, and not the residents' protest group, is the 
official voice of the community. 
</P>
<P>
District directors in November agreed informally to meet sometime in January 
with homeowners and the Town Council, but no date had been set. Rae Berry, 
water board president, said directors had not been formally notified of the 
Jan. 25 meeting date. "The board has not received a written request to meet 
with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Berry said she learned about the meeting from a flyer tucked under the 
windshield wiper of her car while parked at a shopping center. "I didn't hardly 
consider that an official invitation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Town Council members said they will participate at the public meeting in an 
attempt to answer some of the questions from the community. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of the community is not totally aware of what is taking place," 
said Hogue. "They are running without all of the facts. We have to find ways to 
temper the feelings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND Los Angeles city officials notified the Crescenta Valley County 
Water District last May that the tiny district would have to pay at least $8 
million as its share of more than $3.4 billion in improvements to the Hyperion 
Sewage Treatment Plant in order to halt pollution of the coastal waters. But 
district customers were shocked when they received bills in October with a 138% 
hike in sewer fees. Despite protests, district officials have declined to meet 
with angry homeowners.

WEST L.A. FIRM FINED FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Los Angeles furniture manufacturing company has been ordered to pay 
$10,000 in fines and restitution for illegally dumping hazardous materials at 
its facility overlooking Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed on Don Alderson Associates Inc. last week as part of a 
plea bargain in which charges against company President Donald Alderson and two 
associates were dropped, said Deputy City Atty. Teresa Lujan. 
</P>
<P>
The company agreed to enter no-contest pleas to single counts of illegally 
disposing of hazardous waste and failing to maintain a contingency plan and 
employee training plan for dealing with hazardous materials, according to 
Lujan, who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
The company was accused of dumping paint, paint thinner and other debris on the 
ground along a chain-link fence at the rear of the factory at 3327 S. La 
Cienega Place, which sits on an embankment overlooking Ballona Creek. The 
company employs about 26 people at the site, where it manufactures handmade 
specialty furniture for hotels, businesses and homes, Lujan said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared that the illegal dumping had been going on for some time, since 
the inspectors determined . . . that the paint contamination had soaked six to 
eight inches deep into the soil," City Atty. James K. Hahn said in a statement 
announcing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors first issued a notice of violation during a visit Jan. 20, 1989, and 
discovered evidence of further illegal dumping in the same location two months 
later, Lujan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan said Tuesday she allowed the three people to be released from liability 
in the case because they had no prior record of violations and because they 
came into "reasonably good" compliance. 
</P>
<P>
The company's attorney, Aaron Rosen, said releasing the three without charges 
was fair because they had no knowledge of the laws involved and came into 
compliance as soon as they could. 
</P>
<P>
The company also was placed on two years' summary probation by Los Angeles 
Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada, Lujan said.

CITY CELEBRATES KING'S BIRTHDAY, ITS DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. descended on Parcher Plaza -- the heart of 
civic Glendale -- for the first time Monday, as about 80 city officials and 
employees celebrated the 61st birthday of the slain civil rights leader with an 
outdoor party. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. David Scott of the North Glendale United Methodist Church delivered a 
speech, calling for continued progress toward racial unity and citing King's 
famous "I Have a Dream" address. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale High School Chamber Choir opened the festivities with a soulful 
rendition of the national anthem and entertained the crowd after the speech. 
Volunteers served free turkey and ham sandwiches and potato and macaroni salad, 
and Mayor Jerold Milner read a proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the celebration mirrored hundreds of King festivities around 
the country. But for at least one Glendale minority employee, it was a special 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago it was uncomfortable for minorities to come into this city at 
any time, particularly in the evenings," said Glendale Community Relations 
Coordinator Rick Reyes, who has worked for the city for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today there are pockets of resistance, but the attitudes are slowly 
changing." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as three years ago, a black delicatessen owner left town after 
attacks by vandals who repeatedly smeared her store with racist graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the city quietly recognized King's day with a proclamation and a 
lunchtime movie in the basement of city hall.

CSUN GUARD WEINERTH GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: THE SPIRITED FRESHMAN FROM BUENA HIGH HAS PERFORMED CAPABLY 
IN THE LADY MATADORS' BACKCOURT. 
</P>

<P>
Trying to keep in touch with friends in Ventura has become quite expensive for 
Joan Weinerth since she moved to Cal State Northridge in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"My phone bill is enormous," said Weinerth, 18. "I have so many friends still 
living there. It's hard to stay in contact with all of them." 
</P>
<P>
But it was that way even when the former Buena High basketball standout was 
living in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had to install a second telephone line in their home because 
Weinerth and her brother, Robert, 20, used to fight over use of the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Her fighting spirit extends well beyond the length of a phone cord -- all the 
way to the court. 
</P>
<P>
It is 10 a.m. the day before the CSUN women's team is to depart for a game at 
Southern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
During practice in the empty CSUN gym, Weinerth displays a tenacity that many 
players reserve for game days, diving for loose balls, sprinting at full speed 
downcourt on breaks and fighting for rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Intense is a good word," Northridge Coach Leslie Milke said. "She has a little 
wild side in her and sometimes she has a tendency to get out of control. She 
likes to play with a lot of emotion." 
</P>
<P>
At Buena last season, the 5-foot-6 point guard was selected to the Southern 
Section Division I first team after leading the Bulldogs to the Channel League 
title, averaging 19.8 points and 5.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those credentials, Milke didn't envision Weinerth in a starting role 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
After all, at point guard Northridge returned two-year starter Bridgette Ealy, 
a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. first-team selection who led the team in 
assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ealy was forced to redshirt with a nagging hamstring injury after the 
fourth game, Weinerth was pressed into a starting lineup and has filled in 
quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Friday night's home contest against Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
Weinerth leads Northridge (4-12, 1-0) in steals (2.6) and assists (3.3) and is 
second in scoring (9.6). 
</P>
<P>
"We knew she had the potential to be a starter," Milke said. "She had good 
instincts and defensive skills. We thought that she would see a lot of playing 
time, but mostly in a backup role." 
</P>
<P>
Weinerth had other plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to be playing," she said. "I don't like watching from the bench. I 
didn't see myself as a practice player." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Vaughan, Weinerth's coach at Buena, doesn't find her quick contribution 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a real competitor," Vaughan said. "It's a rare ingredient that she has. 
She was born with it. It's something that you can't teach. She has a will to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Milke agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"She has that competitive instinct, a real competitive fire," said Milke, who 
played at Northridge in the late '70s. "She's just doesn't like to lose. I like 
that. She kind of reminds me of myself when I was playing." 
</P>
<P>
Because Weinerth was to have been primarily a ballhandler, her point production 
has been surprising. She has led the team in scoring in three games, including 
a career-high 22 points in a win over San Angelo State. 
</P>
<P>
"With Bridgette out, we needed someone to take charge," Milke said. "She's done 
a really good job. Joanie's getting better and better each game. She had a lot 
of raw ability out of high school and she's poised for a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't anticipate that. I think her background has a lot to do with 
it. She came from a very good high school program." 
</P>
<P>
How good? 
</P>
<P>
The Buena program has won the Channel League title 11 times -- and the state 
title twice -- in the past 13 years. In Weinerth's three years, Buena was 73-9. 
Last season, the Bulldogs advanced to the Southern Section 5-A semifinals 
before losing to eventual champion Hart. 
</P>
<P>
But such success comes only after hard work nearly year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Buena begins workouts, including pick-up games and drills, almost immediately 
after the regular season ends. In May, the team begins practice for summer 
league, playing 20 to 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, an intensive conditioning program starts with rope jumping, 
sprints and work on basic skills; in November, practice for the regular season 
begins. All told, the program requires a commitment of 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tradition and a reputation," said Vaughan, whose career record of 
340-29 is the best among girls' coaches in the state. "The kids understand that 
and make the commitment. The ones that don't fall by the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
It was that reputation that attracted Weinerth to Buena. 
</P>
<P>
Weinerth lived midway between Ventura High and Buena in Ventura's district. 
However, Weinerth obtained a permit to attend Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who comes out of there knows the fundamentals," Weinerth said. "They 
know how to shoot, dribble and play defense. It was hard, but it has prepared 
me for the college level." 
</P>
<P>
She may have been less prepared to lose more games in two months than she lost 
in three years in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, every game I went into I expected to win. Now it's different," 
she said. "I'm not getting used to losing. I'm accepting it better. In the 
beginning I was really frustrated. You try to think of all the things you do 
wrong and all the things you can do to improve. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors have shown improvement of late, winning their first CCAA 
game, 68-65, over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that conference has begun, it means a lot more to us to win. It was a big 
boost to win our first game," Weinerth said. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Weinerth maintains intensity and a positive outlook. It is evident 
even at practice. 
</P>
<P>
As Northridge concludes its workout, each player must make a free throw. With 
each miss, the entire team must sprint up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
Weinerth is the first one back each time. 
</P>
<P>
After the last player has made her free throw, Milke hands out itineraries for 
the next day's trip to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"We're leaving at 7:30 in the morning and we have to drive there," Weinerth 
says to a reporter with her eyes rolled skyward. "It's going to take forever." 
</P>
<P>
She paused for a moment and then smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"But I guess that's OK, I have a lot of friends on the team. It should be fun."

UCLA RECRUITS SHON TARVER AT HIGH DECIBEL AND IN CHORUS

<P>
"We want Tarver!" 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA student section began chanting before the start of the regionally 
televised game between the Bruins and Arizona on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Tarver!" the fans screamed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
It's a cheer Shon Tarver has heard often during home and away high school 
basketball games, but never at a college game. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver appreciates the recognition, but he was caught off guard by the 
reception he received at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited like any recruit would be," he said. "I haven't heard a crowd 
cheering for me to sign with a school before." 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, who has narrowed his choices to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and Syracuse, 
attended the game with highly touted recruits 6-10 junior center Cherokee Parks 
of Marina High in Huntington Beach and 6-11 junior center Eric Meek of San 
Pasqual in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Record-setting game: Entering Tuesday's Frontier League mismatch against Santa 
Clara, Santa Paula Coach Chuck Yuncker knew his team would become the answer to 
a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
Whom did Santa Clara beat to set the Ventura County record for most consecutive 
victories? 
</P>
<P>
The Saints answered that question by drubbing Santa Paula, 71-46, for their 
31st consecutive win, a streak that includes last season's Division IV state 
championship game. Ventura set the previous mark of 30 in a row during the 
1948-49 season. The Saints tied that record with a 73-43 win over Santa Ynez on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula remains on a streak of its own; the Cardinals are winless in 15 
games. Not a pleasant way for a Yuncker to begin his first season as a head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
But Yuncker didn't expect to upset Santa Clara. His main objective was to 
impress Lou Cvijanovich, who helped established Yuncker's coaching philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Yuncker was a varsity assistant and freshman coach when Santa Clara won the 
Southern Section 1-A championship during the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel excited to coach against Lou for the first time," Yuncker said before 
Tuesday's game. "It would be great to beat a powerhouse. But what would be 
greater to me than a upset, would be to show him how far the Santa Paula 
program has come. I would like to see us put it all together and play the best 
game we can with the players we have." 
</P>
<P>
The two schools meet again Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to pass a record: Multi-talented Rob Fournier has the opportunity to set 
Nordhoff High records in three sports. 
</P>
<P>
A point guard on the basketball team, Fournier has 128 assists and needs 52 
more to set the school mark for most assists in a season. Larry Messer 
established the standard of 180 in 1984. Messer was selected Frontier League 
co-most valuable player with Santa Clara's Stacey Cvijanovich, who plays for 
Nevada-Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Fournier, a 5-10 senior, has already set a school mark for most passing yardage 
in a season (1,677) in football and is close to setting several pitching 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Tearing up the course: The Southern Section office has established a new rule 
to help clean up the loose divots left from high school golf competition. 
</P>
<P>
Third-place teams no longer will be automatic qualifiers for team finals unless 
their leagues certify they can reach a minimum score. 
</P>
<P>
The golf coaches advisory committee established Rule 2615.2 in the Southern 
Section Constitution and By-Laws this summer. It states: "To be eligible for 
team regional championship play, all third-place entries must have achieved a 
best nine-hole score of 230 or lower for any eight matches during the season to 
qualify for entry." 
</P>
<P>
That total translates to an average score of 46 for nine holes by the team's 
top five players. Teams play an average of 18 matches a season. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole objective is to weed out really weak teams that are not of solid 
playoff caliber," Southern Section administrator Dean Crowley said. "Those 
teams tend to slow down play and take a few more divots home with them." 
</P>
<P>
Crowley, who also is chairman of the golf committee, said he voted against a 
proposal that would eliminate all third-place entries in the regionals, because 
some leagues are deep in talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this new rule will eliminate a dozen schools and that will solve the 
problem," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Tri playing three?: At a Tri-Valley league meeting for principals and athletic 
directors d Tuesday at Carpinteria High, Marc Groff of St. Bonaventure proposed 
a triple round of league games beginning next basketball season 
</P>
<P>
With Fillmore departing to the Frontier League next fall, the Tri-Valley League 
will be reduced to five teams, creating two additional byes in every team's 
league schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Valley League currently consists of Carpinteria, Fillmore, Moorpark, 
Oak Park, and Bishop Diego in addition to St. Bonaventure. La Reina is a member 
only for girls' sports. 
</P>
<P>
Groff, St. Bonaventure's athletic director and basketball coach, proposed 
increasing the number of league games from eight to 12 and reduce nonleague 
games from 14 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be silly to play almost twice as many nonleague games to 
prepare for league," Groff said. "This proposal would increase the importance 
of league games." 
</P>
<P>
Groff's plan received support from four other schools. Bishop Diego Athletic 
Director Norris Fletcher objected to the plan because he feared that some 
schools might meet four times in a season. Several Tri-Valley League teams 
enter the same tournaments, creating potential match-ups in latter rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic directors from the Tri-Valley League will decide the issue on a Feb. 1 
meeting at Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Three's a crowd: With three Western State Conference road games this week, the 
Moorpark College men's basketball team faces a particularly difficult early 
conference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't intended to be so tough, but Moorpark's game against Cuesta was 
rescheduled from Jan. 6 to Monday after Moorpark was delayed in transit by an 
oil spill on U.S. 101 and missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark slipped by Cuesta, 88-66, Monday night and was to have traveled to 
Ventura on Wednesday night. The Raiders finish the week with a Saturday game at 
WSC Southern Division contender Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll get two out of three, and if we get three out of three, we'll 
be super," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said.

SWIMMER OF PAST IN WAVE OF FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
COMEBACK: THIRTY-PLUS SANDY NEILSON-BELL SEEKS ANOTHER OLYMPIC MEDAL, CASH 
PURSES FOR SWIMMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a joyous interlude in an otherwise tragic event. The Munich Olympics, 
forever remembered for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes, also were the Games 
that brought swimmer Sandy Neilson's tears to millions of living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
After upsetting world record-holder Shane Gould of Australia in the 100-meter 
freestyle, Neilson, then 16, climbed to the top step of the medal platform and 
waited for Avery Brundage, president of the International Olympic Committee, to 
hang the gold medal around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
And as she waited, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
Half her lifetime later, Sandy Neilson-Bell is often reminded of that day. But 
now, the reminders are likely to be colored by a different kind of irony 
because Neilson-Bell has dedicated herself to erasing the last vestiges of the 
anachronistic amateurism the late Brundage had so long personified. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimmers have always had to choose between swimming and making a living," 
Neilson-Bell says. "I want to help pave the way for other athletes to make a 
living from swimming; to help swimmers catch up with other sports." 
</P>
<P>
It's an imposing task. When tennis players fought to turn professional, the 
battle divided the sport. When a maverick pack of distance runners challenged 
the amateur rules governing their sport, it took years of legal arguments to 
solve the issue. Toward their goal, Neilson-Bell and her husband have studied 
the processes by which such sports as track and field have permitted cash 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy would like to see swimmers coming right out of college and getting paid. 
And she's got a point," says Ingrid Daland, director of the Daland Swim Center 
in Thousand Oaks and a former West German national swim champion. "The top West 
Germans are getting 1,200-1,600 marks (about $715-$950)a month. Even swimmers 
at just the national level get free transportation to events, free sweats . . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"Amateurism is out the door in Europe. Why should we have amateurism?" 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a new era of athletic perestroika has taken root in Europe, 
dragging even the Olympic movement itself into the 20th Century, has convinced 
Neilson-Bell it's only a matter of time before U.S. swimming is forced to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Time is another concept Neilson-Bell has decided to challenge. Rather than 
trying to champion the idea of diving for dollars from afar, she is testing the 
waters herself as part of a comeback she hopes will lead to a berth on the 1992 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be 36 then, and while thirtysomething might be a trendy age for 
television, for swimmers it conjures up images of rocking chairs and denture 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* The 1984 U. S. women's swimming team was the oldest ever -- with an average 
age of only 18 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* No U. S. swimmer older than 27 has ever won a gold medal, and that swimmer, 
Frances Schroth, got hers on a relay team in the 1920 Games, when the Olympics 
were little more than a dual meet between the United States and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
* Before Neilson-Bell, no woman older than 30 had ever ranked among the top six 
in the world in any event. 
</P>
<P>
Neilson-Bell isn't the only relative old-timer working toward a berth on the 
Olympic team. Mark Spitz, 39, who set seven world records in Munich, made a 
splash when he announced his comeback plans last fall. 
</P>
<P>
But while Spitz's "grab" start once made him the quickest swimmer off the 
blocks, he hit the water second this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy came first," protests her husband, Keith Bell, a sports psychologist. "I 
don't know whether Mark noticed it or not, but Sandy paved the way." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bell, a former Division III All-American swimmer at Kenyon (Ohio) 
College, who first convinced Neilson-Bell she wasn't washed up. The pair first 
met at a coaches' convention nearly eight years ago, where Bell had come to 
deliver a motivational talk. Later, they talked before a national Masters meet, 
where Bell brought up the idea of a serious comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"He encouraged me to get back into it again," remembers Neilson-Bell, who lives 
in Ventura. "He said, 'I think you should go for '88.' Actually, he said he 
thought I could win (the Olympic Trials)." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Bell was off by an Olympiad because if Neilson-Bell's comeback 
continues apace, she could enter the 1992 Trials as the favorite in the 
50-meter freestyle. In 1984, she just missed qualifying for the Trials and four 
years later, she was a Trials finalist, finishing seventh in 26.04. 
</P>
<P>
And although she missed the team to Seoul by .54 seconds, Neilson-Bell's time 
at the Trials was faster than some of the Olympic finalists'. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in the world is as efficient in the water," Bell says. "She's got a 
perfect stroke." And while a perfect stroke might be bad news to some senior 
citizens, it's a priceless plus to a senior swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Experience, though, not form, could be Neilson-Bell's biggest asset. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe you have an advantage in that you are training smarter," 
Daland says of older competitors. "You don't make excuses. You just do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we know we aren't going downhill physically. At least not until age 
35. We're at our physical peak. There's no reason why we shouldn't be swimming 
at that age." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe one reason. Money. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming's always been a young person's sport," Bell says , "but I always 
thought that was for financial and sociological reasons. It's hard to support 
yourself and continue swimming when you get out of school." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence that age is not the ultimate factor, Neilson-Bell continues to 
improve on personal bests set 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She shattered the Olympic 100-meter record of 58.59 -- and came within .09 
seconds of the world record -- in her Munich win before retiring at age 16. But 
since starting her comeback, she has lowered her 100 best to 57.3, and has 
clocked 26.0 in the 50 free, an event that made its Olympic debut in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so much stronger now than I did when I was 16," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons Neilson-Bell left competitive swimming in the first place were more 
mental than physical. Which is why her husband has been so important to her 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"After '72, I had trouble setting goals," she said. "So many people were 
saying, 'What can you possibly do after three gold medals?' It seemed like 
whatever I would do, I had to top that. And that was a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in the top 5% of her class at El Monte High, Neilson-Bell 
enrolled at UC Santa Barbara as a physical education major with plans to swim 
for enjoyment rather than medals. When the coach there pressured her to return 
to serious competition, she responded by taking up the least serious sport she 
could find -- inner-tube water polo. 
</P>
<P>
But she was never far from competitive shape. In 1977, she won national 
collegiate championships in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. And in 1981, the 
first year she was eligible for Masters competition, she won three national 
age-group titles. Next came the meeting with Bell, which really set the 
comeback in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I see my role with Sandy as convincing her how good she is," says Bell, 41, 
who has written six books and more than 75 articles for professional journals 
on sports psychology. "A lot of it is just keeping her head in the water." 
</P>
<P>
One way Bell does that is by making swimming seem like fun instead of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We never talk about 'working out,' " says Bell. "We talk about 'playing' 
swimming." 
</P>
<P>
The word "pain" is strictly prohibited around the pool, where workouts have 
been replaced by practice. Obstacles and roadblocks are referred to as 
"challenges," and one doesn't make sacrifices for sport, but "choices." 
</P>
<P>
"Swimmers train harder than any other athletes in the world," Bell says. "The 
training is so intense it tends to be viewed as the dues people have to pay; as 
a necessary evil. And it doesn't have to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
In one of their first training sessions together, Neilson-Bell took a look at 
the workout. . . er, practice Bell had planned for her and flinched. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can do all that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the pool," Bell snapped back. "The practice is over." 
</P>
<P>
"No, wait, I'll swim," she said. "I'll try it." 
</P>
<P>
"Then try it tomorrow when you can do it with a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
A positive attitude should help Neilson-Bell in her effort to reform swimming 
because it doesn't figure to happen overnight. In fact, some say she's doing 
little more than tilting at windmills, though recent developments have 
encouraged her. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Olympians Matt Biondi and Tom Jager staged a prize-money match 
race over 50 yards at the Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach, marking the first 
time swimmers openly competed for a cash purse in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why swimmers can't not only defray the costs of their training and 
travel, but also make a living from swimming," says Neilson-Bell, who ran up a 
debt of nearly $40,000 training for her shot at the 1988 Games. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Diamond, the information services director for US Swimming, the sport's 
governing body in the United States, agrees. But he is not optimistic the 
situation will change soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he says, "there's not a great pinata in the sky that everyone 
can take a whack at." 
</P>
<P>
US Swimming operates on a $5 million annual budget which, with nearly 200,000 
registered competitors nationwide, gives it the leanest staff-to-athlete ratio 
of any Olympic sport. But while swimming has taken off as a participant sport, 
it has suffered as a spectator sport, limiting its ability to generate much 
income from gate receipts and making it difficult to negotiate sizable TV 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes and coaches, however, blame the bureaucrats for not doing more to 
promote the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the U. S. swimming governing body that has been slow to 
change," says Neilson-Bell, who is also coach of the Pleasant Valley Swim Club 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly but surely, however, Neilson-Bell is convinced swimming's era of inertia 
is over. She swam for the gold once and it brought tears to her eyes. Now she 
wants a chance to swim for the green.

THOUSAND OAKS LIBRARY BOOKS SUFFER HEAVY DAMAGE IN RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks Library, which has experienced leaks since it opened eight 
years ago, suffered its worst water damage to date during heavy rains last 
weekend and its roof and gutters may have to be replaced, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Library Services Marvin Smith said "dozens and dozens" of books 
have been ruined, including six to eight rare volumes on the history and art of 
book binding. An assessment of damages was still under way Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Smith said, large areas of carpet were soaked and buckling paint 
was peeling off the walls in his office, and the computer room had been 
inundated with half an inch of water Saturday night. The computer was not 
damaged, however. 
</P>
<P>
The library was closed Sunday for cleaning and immediate repairs, and again 
Monday for the Martin Luther King's birthday holiday. It reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and City Manager Grant W. Brimhall said the 60,000-square-foot library, 
which cost $9 million to build, has had leaks since it opened in 1982. Both 
officials attributed most of the leaks to an inadequate gutter system and said 
previous discussions with the architect and contractor had proven futile. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the architect, Albert C. Martin and Associates of Los Angeles, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Brimhall estimated the city had spent between $50,000 and $100,000 on temporary 
repairs and said "more dramatic action" seems necessary, such as complete 
replacement of the roof and gutters. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have a library that leaks," Brimhall said. "People come to the 
library to read books, not take showers." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Mark Sellers said he would review a file on the history of problems 
at the library before deciding whether to file a lawsuit. But Brimhall said he 
hopes to avoid going to court. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks Library, whose modern design has won several awards, holds 
265,000 volumes and circulates 1.4 million materials a year, an amount 
comparable to the circulation of all 17 branches of Ventura County's library 
system, Smith said.

COUNTY OFFICIAL SEES DECREASE IN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for the coming year will put Ventura 
County in a difficult financial squeeze and could mean decreased services for 
the poor, disabled and jobless, County Administrative Officer Richard 
Wittenberg said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's programs, including those for the medically indigent, in-home 
services for the disabled, Medi-Cal recipients and family planning clinics, 
would suffer an estimated $5-million cut at a time when they need a 10% 
increase, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Counties cannot keep pace with growth of caseloads, and the state budgets 
cannot continue to be balanced on the wholesale shifting of responsibility to 
counties," Wittenberg said. "And that's what the governor has consistently 
tried to do." 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg and other county officials hold out hope that the funds allocated to 
counties will be significantly increased as the state Legislature reworks the 
budget beginning with hearings late next month. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who represents the western county, sits on 
the Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, which could allow Ventura County some 
leverage. But Joseph Caves, Hart's legislative assistant, gave little 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're under real constraints this year, so it's not clear how much flexibility 
we'll have," Caves said. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that caseloads, or the number of people needing services, such 
as Medi-Cal and social services recipients, will total an 11% increase over 
last year statewide, Wittenberg said. That compares to the 8% estimated 
increase in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"The legislators will try to come back and provide greater assistance to the 
counties, and decrease some of the health and social service cuts that the 
governor has made," Caves said. "But to what extent it's possible, we can't say 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg, in a report to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, outlined the 
good and bad news for the county. He could not estimate the amount of state 
funds that would come into county accounts, but he counted among the good news 
a $17.4-million increase statewide in funds for immunization to prevent the 
spread of disease, a $25-million increase for mental health and a $4.6-million 
increase for a substance abuse program for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news, said Wittenberg, is more substantial. It included a statewide 
$150-million decrease in general funding not allocated for specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
Also disturbing, Wittenberg said, is a $74-million reduction in the funds 
allocated to Medi-Cal for additional benefits that include transportation, 
counseling and heroin detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
The county executive also cited a $20-million reduction in funds available for 
county reimbursement for expenses incurred by Medi-Cal patients and a 
$24-million decrease in family planning services, which provide counseling, but 
not abortions, for mostly young, unmarried and poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg said other cuts include a $91.6-million reduction in the GAIN 
program, which provides vocational education to welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg complained that the state does not pay for the programs that it 
mandates. 
</P>
<P>
"When we implemented the GAIN program, the state said it would fund it 
completely," Wittenberg said.

RAINFALL WILL NOT HALT WATER RATIONING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the deluge of rain that hit the county last week, the city of Ventura 
plans to forge ahead with a water rationing program. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the recent rain soaked into the ground, failing to provide the 
runoff needed to add water to Ventura's two primary sources, the Ventura River 
and Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain that we've had really soaked into the ground but hasn't added much to 
runoff, which is what we need," said Shelley Jones, Ventura city public works 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The water conservation program, which is still under wraps, will include 
elements of rationing programs used by six California cities, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it will follow most closely a stringent program in Goleta that forces 
residents who use excessive water to pay up to 10 times normal water rates, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be unveiled for review by the City Council either later this 
month or in early February. 
</P>
<P>
Additional winter storms of the same magnitude could begin to produce runoff 
that would help restore levels in Lake Casitas and the Ventura Rivers, said 
Dick Barnett, engineering department manager for the Casitas Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ventura plans to play it safe no matter what the winter brings. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it rains, there will still be a program in Ventura that will cause 
people to reduce their water use," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-year statewide drought, 130 agencies statewide have imposed 
rationing programs that affect 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura is not all alone out there," Jones said.

IMPERIAL BEACH'S BEACH A DRAG; CITY SEEKS TO CUT IT LOOSE

<P>
Most people would give anything to own a stretch of the San Diego County shore, 
especially if it includes a fishing pier and a short drive to a venerable 
tourist center like the Hotel del Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Not the City of Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The financially ailing border town is so desperate to cut costs that it is 
actually asking the state for permission to give away its responsibility for 
3.5 miles of oceanfront from Coronado to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
At the city's request, Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) on Wednesday introduced 
legislation that would allow the beleaguered city of 24,500 residents to deed 
over its tidelands to the San Diego Unified Port District, which controls most 
of the other tidelands in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Such a transfer, city officials say, would save the Imperial Beach treasury 
$1.5 million each year in expenses to patrol and maintain the beach, as well as 
pay off the bill for an extensive face lift of the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
With those expenses gone -- they gobble up 30% of the city budget -- the city 
has a chance to reverse its dismal record of municipal finance and keep from 
becoming financially insolvent by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"If something doesn't happen before the end of the budget year in July 1990, 
the city should begin its disincorporation," said Richard Jung, Imperial Beach 
director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
And, just in case the tidelands transfer isn't enough, Deddeh said Wednesday, 
he also will introduce measures during the next few weeks as a sort of 
piecemeal financial aid package for San Diego County's neediest city. One of 
the bills would propose that the state loan the city $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial Beach may just be the only city in the state that is experiencing 
this kind of financial difficulty, and I hope they are the only one," Deddeh 
said about the unusual loan. "And, if my colleagues are compassionate, I plan 
to plead my case with the governor . . . and see if we can swing it." 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial woes are the result of a decade of deficit spending, in 
which city fathers consistently dipped into the financial reserves to make up 
for a shortfall in municipal revenues, officials say. The city has also made 
some major mistakes, like the $300,000 loss it suffered in 1986 and 1987 on bad 
stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the City Council created another financial fiasco when it voted to 
spend $2.9 million to refurbish its 1,500-foot fishing pier so it could be 
leased to a commercial sportfishing business. 
</P>
<P>
Although paying off the bonds would cost $356,000 a year, council members 
thought they could make that up with the city's share of the fishing business 
revenues -- estimated at the time to be between $150,000 to $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the city hasn't received anything because the business, Imperial 
Beach Sportfishing Inc., has yet to set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city receives no revenue from its beaches, it pays out nearly a 
third of its $5-million municipal budget to keep them clean and safe, said 
Imperial Beach City Manager Ron Jack. 
</P>
<P>
And, to add insult to injury, statistics show that only about 25% of the people 
who use the beaches are Imperial Beach residents; the rest are people who pay 
no taxes for beach upkeep, Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that controlling your destiny is paying 30% of your budget and 
getting no return," Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
The solution: Give the beach away. 
</P>
<P>
Jack said Wednesday that deeding the tidelands over to the Port District was 
supposed to be done after the 1963 formation of the district by the 
Legislature. The four other member cities in the district -- San Diego, Chula 
Vista, Coronado and National City -- all gave their tidelands to the port, 
which then became responsible for coastline commercial and recreational 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, however, held onto its land temporarily to help the district in 
its planning for a second bay entrance near the border. When plans for the 
second entrance fell through, Imperial Beach never bothered to officially give 
its land to the port -- a decision that led to a constant drain on city 
coffers, Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Deddeh's bill would "clean up 27 years of history, where the city was 
not a direct beneficiary of the Port District, although city residents paid the 
initial taxes to establish the Port District." 
</P>
<P>
Port commissioners last week went on record supporting any efforts to deed the 
Imperial Beach tidelands to the port, a district spokesman said Wednesday.

ELECTION FUND FRAUD CHARGES PROBED IN '88 CUDAHY RACE

<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating allegations by a 
city councilman that his campaign manager falsified financial reports, 
apparently to cover up contributions from a questionable source. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Colon, also a Cudahy city councilman, is under investigation for 
falsifying contributions to Councilman John Robertson's campaign two years ago, 
according to Sandra Michioku, commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that Colon, acting as campaign treasurer, may have padded 
financial reports to mask contributions from another source. Robertson would 
not identify the campaign contributor. Robertson refused to sign the financial 
report and instead, submitted one of his own to the commission in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There were numbers on the (campaign disclosure) statements I could in no way 
verify," Robertson said in an interview this week. "There are some suspicions 
that people gave money to the campaign that were not listed. The question is 
who really gave the money?" 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Colon said his statements are accurate, and 
described the investigation as an attempt by his political opponents to "muddy 
the waters" before he seeks reelection this April. He said he expects that the 
FPPC investigation will prove he did not lie in the campaign report. 
</P>
<P>
"They (FPPC) are not going to find anything," Colon said. "That campaign 
statement was filed in 1988. If this was true why didn't they (political 
opponents) bring it out then? Why now? If they are trying to make me look bad, 
then they are wasting their time because I don't care. I know they want me 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson is not the only city official to complain to the commission. 
Councilman Joseph Fregeau said last year he wrote the FPPC to complain about 
discrepancies in the same report and the possibility that an unknown person 
secretly funded the campaign. He said he received a letter from the commission 
late last summer informing him that they had received the complaint, but could 
not begin an investigation because of a backlog of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fregeau and Robertson received money from Citizens for Progress of the 
City of Cudahy, the committee that listed Colon as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the campaign disclosure statement filed in October, 1988, by 
Colon, Mayor Joseph Graffio and Councilman Tom Thurman each contributed $1,014. 
Both have denied contributing that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I gave a thousand dollars," Graffio said. "I gave Colon $309. 
I don't know what he is doing, but I know what I gave him." 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said he believed he contributed about $300 to the reelection campaign, 
but said he did not recall donating an additional $714. 
</P>
<P>
According to the first campaign report filed by Colon and signed by Robertson, 
Robertson contributed $1,500 to his own campaign. In the final campaign 
statement that Robertson refused to sign, Robertson is reported to have 
contributed $2,214. Robertson said he cannot recall how much he contributed to 
Citizens for Progress, but said in all he spent about $4,500 toward his own 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Fregeau reportedly donated $765, according to the Colon statement. In 
Robertson's campaign statement Fregeau is reported to have donated $215. 
Approximately $2,483, according to Colon's report, was contributed by Colon and 
three of his children. Robertson said it is hard for him to believe that 
Colon's three children, two of whom were working at temporary jobs at the time, 
could afford to give the approximately $400 they each reportedly contributed. 
</P>
<P>
But Colon said his children often contribute to political campaigns. His 
daughter Karin Kellough said she believed her ex-husband had contributed to 
Robertson's reelection campaign, but said she was not sure because they had 
contributed to many campaigns. Colon's son Gary and his daughter Carol Duvall, 
both of whom are also listed as contributors, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The only contributor whose donation Robertson does not challenge is the $100 
contribution of Georgia Scrivner, who has since launched a recall campaign 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that although Colon was working for him, he is not responsible 
for how Colon ran the financial side of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I be?" Robertson asked. "I didn't know what was going on in that 
regard. He was the man gathering the checks. The money didn't come to me it 
went to Bill (Colon). Unfortunately, I got wrapped up in something I didn't 
enjoy. It was an error in judgment." 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's Michioku said individuals found in violation of the Political Reform 
Act of 1974 can be fined up to $2,000 per violation. The investigation, she 
said, should be completed in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
John Robertson was elected April 1, 1988, to his fourth term on the Cudahy City 
Council. His campaign was managed by Councilman Bill Colon, an ally who since 
has split with Robertson on a number of issues being considered by the council. 
Robertson ran with Joseph Fregeau, who lost to veteran Councilman Gabe Zippi. 
Fregeau was appointed to the council after Zippi died eight months later.

LAKEWOOD COUNCIL MEMBER RETIRING AFTER 12 YEARS

<P>
Jacqueline Rynerson, who helped the city to incorporate nearly 40 years ago, is 
retiring after 12 years of service on the City Council, three of them as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Rynerson is not running for reelection in April, leaving Councilman Larry Van 
Nostran as the only incumbent on the ballot. Two seats are open this year on 
the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a wonderful experience," Rynerson said of her three council terms. 
"It's been great but the time comes when you leave." 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman, who will turn 69 this year, said that she and her husband, 
Dewain (Bud) Rynerson, a retired supervisor at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, 
want to travel more and spend time with their children and grandchildren. The 
couple have three sons, one daughter and eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Rynerson is the second veteran female official in the area whose name will not 
be on the ballot this spring. Cerritos Mayor Diana Needham, who also has 12 
years of council service behind her, said she would not seek reelection. A 
court last month upheld a Cerritos referendum limiting council members to two 
consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Rynersons moved to Lakewood in 1952 and she became secretary of the 
Lakewood Civic Council, a hotbed of the anti-annexation fever that kept the 
community from being swallowed up by Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The civic council developed what became known as the "Lakewood Plan." Under the 
plan, Lakewood incorporated in 1954 by pioneering a system that allows 
municipalities to contract with Los Angeles County for such services as fire, 
police and code enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was that we would try to do a more modified kind of government," 
Rynerson recalled. It was difficult, she said, for a new community to find the 
money to build such things as fire and police facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It started a wave of incorporations," she said of Lakewood's experience. "If 
you look at history and see how many cities incorporated after the Lakewood 
Plan you'll find quite a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Rynerson also served on the committee that developed the city's park system and 
has been active in a broad range of civic and community groups, including 
Friends of the Library, the PTA and the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
She has represented the city in the Southern California Assn. of Governments, 
the League of California Cities and the National League of Cities. She has also 
received many honors, including the "Woman of Distinction" in 1987 from the 
Lakewood/Long Beach Soroptimist Club. 
</P>
<P>
Service on the City Council, Rynerson said, has been fascinating. "Until you're 
on the council, you can't begin to realize the variety of issues you deal with. 
You're always learning." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult council decision she has had to make in recent memory, 
Rynerson said, was on the city-generated plan to build a commercial office 
development on the site of the old Standard Oil tank farm in the northwest 
corner of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, Rynerson said, designed the development to generate what they 
assumed would be welcome tax dollars. Residents of the area, however, crowded 
into City Hall, protesting commercial development and calling for single-family 
housing on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The council, which ultimately agreed to put housing there, was taken aback by 
the community reaction, Rynerson said. "We did a lot of soul-searching because 
we really wanted to be responsible."

BALLROOM BOUTS: 1ST ROUND IS BLACK TIE; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: AFTER TWO TRIAL RUNS, PROMOTERS WIN DECISION FROM LONG BEACH PLANNING 
COMMISSION TO STAGE FIGHTS AT HOTEL.

<P>
This is not boxing at the Olympic Auditorium where you step in gum and throw 
beer. This is crystal chandeliers, ringside cocktails and gourmet hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a fight, it is "an evening." Never mind that at the end of the 
evening somebody might leave with a face that resembles raw meat. 
</P>
<P>
This is civilized boxing by the sea and it has come to the grand ballroom of 
the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people's idea of boxing is live from the Olympic Auditorium when they 
used to have riots and throw beers and referees got hit in the head with 
bottles. This is back to the days of Tunney and Dempsey and Madison Square 
Garden, when people got all dressed up to go to the fights," said Jerry 
Westlund, an auctioneer and first-time boxing promoter at age 24. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, boxing has been moving from the sweaty, smoky arena to the 
grand ballrooms of suburban hotels throughout the country, where ring girls 
prance around in tasteful bathing suits with cards to help spectators keep 
track of the round. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the city Planning Commission gave Westlund and John Boyd Hall, a 
31-year-old local furrier, permission to stage monthly bouts at the Hyatt for a 
year. That makes Long Beach the second city in Southern California to offer 
ballroom boxing with small purses, genteel crowds and young talents. 
</P>
<P>
Matches so far have included the state middleweight championship, and 
up-and-comers like Steven Mwema, a bantamweight from the Kenyan Olympic boxing 
team who "a lot of insiders feel will be a world champ someday," according to 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters have tried before and failed to bring "yuppie boxing" to Long Beach. 
Last year, a match scheduled at the Golden Sails Hotel on Pacific Coast Highway 
collapsed under the weight of numerous permits the city requires. The event was 
publicized, then canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don Fraser tried five years ago to put on matches under the wing of 
the Spruce Goose. Although he went on to make monthly fights a raging yuppie 
success at the Irvine Marriott -- the only other site of high-class hotel 
boxing in Southern California -- he threw in the towel in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It did OK, then we broke for the summer, and it never did get going again," he 
said. "At that time, there was no demand for boxing in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Then along came Westlund and Hall, a couple of businessmen who sit on the 
boards of directors of local charities -- a noticeable departure, they say, 
from the classic fight promoter with "greasy hair and gold chains who chews his 
cigar." 
</P>
<P>
They obtained licenses from the California Athletic Commission, then traveled 
from Las Vegas to Mexico scouting fighters. The city granted them special 
permission to put on two trial matches at the Hyatt, one in November and the 
other last Thursday night, while the Planning Commission decided whether to 
make Boxing by the Beach a permanent attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Both matches were near-sellouts, the promoters report. Former heavyweight 
legend Ken Norton and two local city councilmen were there. The goal may have 
been tuxes and gowns, but there also were plenty of T-shirts and tennis shoes. 
At the first event, however, about 25 people from the Civic Light Opera did 
show up in black tie and sipped cocktails while 10 men in five bouts slugged 
each other over a 2 1/2-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
"It just attracts a certain kind of crowd, a cut above the norm, a lot of 
yuppie action," said Tim O'Connor, a Los Angeles diamond dealer who attended 
both matches, tooling into town in his Arctic-blue BMW, sipping Perrier from a 
ringside seat, then heading on to his oceanside home in Laguna Beach. "It has 
that Las Vegas feel." 
</P>
<P>
The ring girls -- in one-piece bathing suits to preserve dignity -- flashed 
their cards and the one who elicited the loudest hoots was pronounced the 
winner of the ring girl contest. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys love 'em," Hall said. "Their swimsuits are very tasteful. You have to 
keep it tasteful. It's not like you have a ring in a parking lot. This is a 
ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission gave its unanimous approval to the idea after 
Commissioner Pat Schauer was disabused of the notion that the boxing crowd is a 
sweaty, smoky brawl waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Will there be an exhaust system to handle the body heat and smoke?" she wanted 
to know. "How do you protect against butts going onto the carpet? Will there be 
extra police? Will liquor be sold at halftime?" 
</P>
<P>
Not only are these nonsmoking events, the commission was assured, but some say 
they will go a long way toward attracting the after-hours crowd the city badly 
needs to wake up its ailing downtown commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains to be seen now is whether yuppie boxing will knock Long Beach 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach is a big sports town," Westlund said wishfully, noting that he once 
saw people lined up outside a sports bar at 8:30 Sunday morning to watch a Rams 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The next boxing match is scheduled Feb. 13. The March match, date unknown, will 
feature the state heavyweight title bout, Westlund said. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets range from $20 to $40. The best seats are ringside with cocktail table 
service and the worst are no more than 48 feet from the action, Westlund said.

Jerry Winfrey's efforts to advance his career as a policeman by taking college 
courses have been hampered by his irregular hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I might work graveyard for a while, then switch to day shift, I just 
can't always get to school," Winfrey, 26, said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cerritos College is offering a course that will allow the Bell Gardens 
policeman to participate in an English composition class any time he wants. He 
can go to class at any hour of the day or night by simply turning on his home 
computer and modem, an electronic device that will connect him with the college 
classroom computer by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey is one of 54 students who have signed up for Prof. George Jaeger's 
computerized 18-week freshman composition class, which started Wednesday. 
Normal class size is 30. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't come to us, we'll come to you. The idea is to take the classroom 
to the people" Jaeger said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger started the course on an experimental basis in 1989 as a way of reaching 
non-traditional students, such as housewives, professional people, the 
handicapped and hospital patients. Jaeger said he hopes to have the classes go 
into prisons someday. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Irwin, a 68-year-old retired communications-equipment operator from 
Long Beach, has signed up for the class. Another Long Beach student, David 
Cayton, 23, travels a great deal in his job as a computer repairman and 
consultant. Both say it is more convenient to take the class through computers. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I had to withdraw from classes at Cerritos because of conflict with 
my work. I couldn't get to the campus. It won't happen with this class," Cayton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The students are required to come to the campus only on opening day, and for 
midterm and final exams. Otherwise, Jaeger will communicate with them via his 
computer in his office at the college or his personal computer at his home in 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger, who has taught at the Norwalk-based college for 25 years, took a 
one-year sabbatical during the 1988-89 school year to learn about "computer 
telecommunications." 
</P>
<P>
He said his program is modeled after similar courses offered through the 
Electronic University Network, a group of 14 participating colleges and 
universities, including Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Penn State. Most of the 
schools are in the East. 
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 students throughout the nation are signed up with the San 
Francisco-based university network to take courses ranging from literature to 
mathematics to psychology, said Ned Davis, vice president of marketing at 
Electronic. The electronic classroom "is the wave of the future. It allows 
students to work at their own pace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Silvia R. Hubbell, who heads the liberal arts department at Cerritos College, 
gave Jaeger final approval to start the class. Hubbell said she believes the 
concept will be expanded to other classes. 
</P>
<P>
Lacreta Scott, who heads the English department at Cerritos, said teachers have 
been "very supportive" of the pilot program. "We are committed to growth and 
progress and what works best for students," Scott said. She acknowledged, 
however, that most professors still prefer the traditional methods of teaching, 
and that the class would not work for all students, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger said the computer still permits a one-to-one relationship with his 
students. "The computer screen is the student's classroom. It allows us to 
type-talk," Jaeger said. And students who want to communicate with each other 
can do so through the computer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger also has a more traditional freshman composition English class, in which 
students use the computer as well as come to class at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
The other community college campuses might eventually consider similar programs 
to help accommodate an anticipated growth in enrollment over the next 15 years, 
said Ann Reed, vice chancellor of California Community Colleges. Enrollment is 
expected to increase from 1.3 million to more than 1.8 million in 15 years, she 
said.

<P>
'IRREPLACEABLE' SCOUT TROOP FLAG STOLEN FROM CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Boy Scout Troop 671, based in Los Alamitos, are upset about the 
recent theft of a car. But what concerns them more than the loss of the 
vehicle, which was later found stripped in Wilmington, is the loss of an 
American flag and their troop flag that had been temporarily stored in the 
car's back seat. 
</P>
<P>
"The flags have a lot of sentimental value for all the boys who have been in 
the troop," Scoutmaster Nick Testa said. Of particular value, he said, is the 
red-and-white troop flag, which contains a collection of special ribbons 
signifying various awards the troop has won in its 22-year history. "It is 
irreplaceable," Testa said of the flag, which is used in parades and special 
ceremonies. "Once it's gone, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
The Scouts' woes began on Jan. 4 when the car, which belongs to the parents of 
one of the troop's 43 members, was stolen from the driveway of their Garden 
Grove home. The flags had been stored in the car for an upcoming event. Two 
days later the car was found in Wilmington, minus the flags. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have taken them out and just thrown them anywhere, perhaps in Long 
Beach," Testa said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the flags' whereabouts, he said, is asked to call 
him at (714) 894-4941.

<P>
A home economics teacher at Bellflower High School was one of two teachers 
selected statewide for the 1989 Home Economics Teachers Recognition Award. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Grohmann, who has been teaching at Bellflower High School since 1984, was 
given the award for her dedication and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Grohmann was awarded a $25,000 federal grant to set up a 
catering class at the high school. She said her students operated a small 
restaurant and catered meals to the faculty and the community.

EMOTIONS HIGH AT HEARING ON GAY RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL ADVANCES A MEASURE TO BAN DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST GAYS AND LESBIANS AT A PACKED PUBLIC HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to outlaw discrimination against gays and lesbians in the city of 
San Diego passed its first test Wednesday in perhaps the most emotional public 
hearing since the City Council debated a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Vehement opponents of the measure matched Biblical verse prohibiting 
homosexuality against gays' heartfelt stories of discrimination during two 
hours of testimony before the council's Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee referred a task force's proposed "Human Dignity Ordinance" to 
City Atty. John Witt's office for formal preparation as city law. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 people packed the council chamber, spilling into the hallway and an 
adjacent conference room on the 12th floor of City Hall. At least two extra 
police officers were on hand, but the crowd was orderly. 
</P>
<P>
The full council is expected to consider the ordinance sometime before April 
30. Five of the nine council members have publicly supported the measure, 
seemingly guaranteeing its passage. But opponents from the religious right 
promised Wednesday to overturn the measure by referendum if it becomes law, an 
electoral contest that could prove as emotional and divisive as the two failed 
efforts to name a local landmark for King. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor abstained from voting after Wednesday's debate, 
explaining that she does not want to take a position until Witt outlines why a 
local ordinance is needed to complement state and federal anti-discrimination 
laws. But O'Connor's five colleagues on the committee -- Wes Pratt, Ron 
Roberts, Linda Bernhardt, Abbe Wolfsheimer and Bob Filner -- sent the proposal 
to Witt almost without comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance is necessary," said Pratt, who introduced the legislation 
written by a task force of 13 community activists, many of them gays and 
lesbians. "I, as an African-American elected official, cannot condone 
discrimination in any fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would outlaw discrimination against homosexuals in employment, 
housing and real estate transactions, education, business establishments and 
provision of city facilities and services. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who believes he or she is a victim of such discrimination would be 
allowed to seek a court injunction to halt it and sue for as much as three 
times the actual amount of damages, or as little as $250. Witt's office also 
would be allowed to take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
One exception written into the latest draft of the proposal would allow 
religious organizations to discriminate in the employment of anyone involved in 
actual religious rites. However, other employees of a religious organization 
would be covered by the anti-discrimination ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
A Sept. 27 review by Deputy City Atty. Mary Kay Jackson concluded that "most of 
the protections requested in this proposed ordinance are not currently afforded 
by either federal or state law." Jackson also added that the ban "would not 
provide homosexuals more protections than other groups already covered by class 
status" such as race, sex, religion, national origin or physical disability. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal results from nearly two years of work by a task force organized by 
leaders of the city's three gay political clubs, said Stan Berry, chairman of 
the Human Dignity Ordinance task force. Passage would add San Diego to a list 
of California cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa 
Barbara and Oakland that have laws on the books prohibiting various forms of 
discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Wednesday, gays and lesbians urged the council to enact the 
protections, saying that many still hide their sexual preferences from 
landlords, employers and co-workers to prevent eviction, firings and 
harassment. Several said they were taking a risk merely by testifying before 
television cameras Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Prejudice and discrimination against the gay minority is an institutionalized 
reality in our city," said Scott Fulkerson, executive director of the Center 
for Social Services, a human service organization for homosexuals. "From hate 
crimes to employment discrimination, housing to medical care, the lesbian and 
gay minority is effectively locked out of full and equal participation in our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Portantino, a financial adviser for Prudential-Bache Securities and 
owner of a gay newspaper, said his boss attempted to fire him when he 
advertised in a gay publication using the company name, and that he is being 
pressured again this week because of using the company name while supporting 
the ordinance on a radio call-in show. Several other people told similar 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
But many opponents of the measure criticized the establishment of legal 
protections for a group of people based on a "behavior," not birth, claiming 
that homosexuality is a preference chosen by gays and lesbians. Some suggested 
that the council would have to enact similar legislation for pedophiles or 
adulterers. 
</P>
<P>
"Should a person who commits incest within the family, claiming his behavior is 
immutable and his only enjoyable outlet for sexual expression, be insulated 
from discrimination?" asked the Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the 
Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, which he claimed represents 6,500 
churches. "Once one begins to give protection to sexually deviant behavior and 
accord it special social protection, one is on a slippery slope. To encourage 
or enable such behavior is hardly the exercise of genuine compassion." 
</P>
<P>
Others claimed that the protections were "anti-family" and questioned whether 
they would unfairly hamstring the rights of employers to select workers. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference before Wednesday's hearing, Sheldon said gays and lesbians 
should take their grievances about discrimination to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Sheldon's critics believe that his claims about the size of his 
organization are exaggerated, but he was actively involved in passage of a 
ballot measure that stripped homosexuals of protections under Irvine's 
anti-discrimination ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, opponents, including Sheldon's group, an organization 
of evangelical churches and the Concerned Women for America, said they are 
preparing to launch a referendum if the council enacts the ordinance.

WEATHER GRAB BAG DUMPS OUT SURPRISES 
</P>

<P>
Snow in the mountains, hail in the South Bay and a biting cold rain everywhere 
else prompted officials Wednesday to open emergency shelters for the homeless, 
issue traveler's advisories and close schools. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol also reported several minor traffic accidents 
caused by rain-slicked roads. Two power outages triggered by lightning strikes 
were also blamed on the intense storm from the Gulf of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
More than a foot of snow fell on local mountains Wednesday, and about half an 
inch of rain doused Lindbergh Field, said National Weather Service forecaster 
Wilbur Shigehara. A heavy hailstorm pelted Chula Vista about 8 a.m. and another 
blanketed the top of Mt. Helix before noon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Laguna got 14 inches of snow and took the prize," Shigehara said. 
"Cuyamaca had 10 inches, Julian had 7 1/2, and Mt. Palomar had 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"With this storm, we've gotten reports of snow, hail, funnel clouds, 
waterspouts, and very, very cold temperatures. We'll be on the very fringe of 
the storm by Thursday, and we should see more sunshine, but nothing would 
surprise me at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The storm will begin slowly moving east today, leaving partly cloudy skies and 
a 20% chance of lingering showers in its wake, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol on Wednesday also enacted a traveler's advisory 
that required all vehicles going beyond the 2,000-foot level to have tire 
chains. This includes Sunrise Highway through Mt. Laguna, Highway 79 through 
Cuyamaca, and Highway 78 through Julian, a CHP spokesman said. The advisory is 
expected to last through Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in Julian and the Mountain Empire Unified School District were closed 
Wednesday because of snow-clogged roads. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the mid-30s Wednesday night prompted the County Office of 
Disaster Preparedness to open emergency shelters for the homeless at the El 
Cajon and Vista armories. 
</P>
<P>
A power outage occurred in Clairemont late Tuesday night when lightning struck 
a transformer, said Jesse Flores, a San Diego Gas &amp; Electric spokesman. It 
took repair crews more than 10 hours to restore power to 200 customers between 
Clairemont Mesa Boulevard and Diane Place, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,800 people in Kearny Mesa were without power Wednesday morning when 
lightning struck a utility pole about 9:30 a.m. in the 4000 block of Ashford 
Street, Flores said. Repair crews restored power an hour later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the storm makes its way toward Arizona today, temperatures will warm several 
degrees and some sunshine will peep through the lingering clouds, Shigehara 
said. Friday calls for more warming and drying. 
</P>
<P>
High temperatures today countywide will be 55 to 60 degrees, Shigehara said. 
Coastal lows tonight and Friday night will be 35 to 45 degrees. Thursday night, 
there may be frost on the car windshields in Del Mar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lows for the inland areas will be 31 to 41 degrees tonight and Friday night, 
Shigehara said. For the coldest agricultural areas, lows may dip into the upper 
20s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Highs in the mountains will struggle to get past the mid-30s today and Friday, 
Shigehara said. Overnight lows will be 17 to 27 degrees tonight and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There may be isolated showers in the deserts today, and highs will be 58 to 65 
degrees today and Friday, Shigehara said. Overnight lows will be near freezing, 
in the low 30s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent storm brought the season rain total to 3.96 inches, Shigehara said. 
For this time of year, 4.25 inches is considered normal, he said.

FBI INVESTIGATING ALLEGED ABUSE OF MIGRANT WORKER IN CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI is looking into the alleged kidnaping and beating of a North County 
migrant worker by two Carlsbad brothers outside their rural market earlier this 
month, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Orrantia, an FBI spokesman in San Diego, said the agency will forward its 
report on the case to Washington, where U.S. Justice Department officials will 
decide whether to pursue federal allegations of civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're following the state prosecution of the case and will be submitting 
whatever happens here to the Department of Justice's civil rights division in 
Washington," he said. "Then they'll have to decide whether to pursue the case 
on a federal level." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad police said that FBI agents had met with police supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Richard Castaneda, the police investigator who has been assigned to 
the kidnaping probe, said he is under orders not to talk about developments in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
He referred all questions to his supervisor, Carlsbad Police Lt. Don Lewis, who 
did not return telephone calls late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The police probe revolves around an alleged kidnaping Jan. 3 outside the 
Country Store market on El Camino Real in Carlsbad. According to detectives, 
store owner Rickey Ryberg and brother Randy, a baker at the store, abducted a 
26-year-old laborer as he arrived that morning to solicit work outside the 
rural market. 
</P>
<P>
Candido Salas, a Mexican immigrant who has lived and worked in the growing 
fields near the store over the past four months, said the Rybergs handcuffed 
him for several hours to a railing in the rear of the store. He was also beaten 
about the chest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before releasing him, the brothers bound the migrant worker's legs and arms 
with duct tape and placed a bag on his head on which was written "No Mas Aqui," 
ungrammatical Spanish for "Don't Come Back." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have since come forth to report that several other migrant workers 
have received similar treatment from the brothers -- but have been afraid to 
make reports before the most recent incident, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Salas has said that he will press charges against the brothers because he is 
tired of such violent treatment of migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs have been charged by the state with kidnaping, false imprisonment, 
battery and civil rights violations. They are scheduled for arraignment Monday 
in Vista Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Smith, an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, a nonprofit 
migrant advocacy group in Oceanside, said she called federal authorities last 
week to request that they investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she first called the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego and was 
referred to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them to open a case of possible conspiracy to violate civil rights," 
she said. "I wanted to make sure that the FBI was going to investigate it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who said her group was considering whether to file a civil lawsuit in 
the case, said she was also concerned over a statement of sympathy for the 
store owners made by Carlsbad Detective Sgt. Bill Huntington in a recent Times 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"They were frustrated, pure and simple, but I don't think this thing has any 
racist overtones," the officer said of the brothers. "This thing is a two-way 
street. A businessman loses thousands of dollars a year to shoplifters, people 
scaring away his good customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking any sides in this, although I know Rick personally. What he did 
was wrong. But I can also see the frustration." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Rafael Martinez, executive director of the North County Chaplaincy, 
another migrant advocacy group in Encinitas, said he was appalled not only by 
the violence, but also by statements made by police about the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a problem with police officers making such a statement that is, in 
effect, a justification of what these people have allegedly done," he said. 
"People need to go see a psychiatrist, not go out and beat innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he believes the incidents at the Country Store, as well as the 
Carlsbad Police Department's handling of the case, deserve serious evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad things have happened there. And if they're just going to be swept under 
the carpet and written off to pure frustration, they're going to happen again. 
Hispanic people are citizens here too, and we deserve full protection under the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not begging. We're demanding it."

President Bush on Tuesday named the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc Center for 
the homeless in San Diego one of his "thousand points of light," an example of 
how volunteerism can help solve America's social problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 350-bed shelter for men is actually part of a larger St. Vincent de Paul 
Center, including a separate 150-bed shelter for families and others without a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The men's shelter was opened in 1987 with the help of a $3.5-million gift from 
Joan Kroc, widow of the founder of the McDonald's restaurant chain and owner of 
the San Diego Padres baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc, who has donated millions to help the needy as well as in support of 
nuclear disarmament, also gave $1 million to the Democratic National Committee 
in 1987, making her the biggest donor in party history. Her late husband, Ray, 
was a major contributor to Republican causes.

<P>
The last three vacant spots on the 71-member San Diego County Superior Court 
bench were filled Wednesday with the appointments of a deputy district 
attorney, an assistant city attorney and a family law specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who made the appointments, also filled two Municipal 
Court slots -- one in San Diego and one in El Cajon -- with two deputy district 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The three Superior Court appointments completed the 18-judge expansion of the 
court announced last year and delighted Judith McConnell, its presiding judge, 
who said Wednesday that she was "in heaven" with visions of the bench at full 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
The three new Superior Court judges -- Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Whelan, Asst. 
City Atty. Ronald L. Johnson and family lawyer Wesley R. Mason III -- are 
scheduled to be sworn in next week. 
</P>
<P>
Both Johnson and Mason will fill new positions. Whelan, the chief of the 
district attorney's El Cajon office, will replace Judge Louis E. Boyle, who 
abruptly stepped down from the bench late last month to return to the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle's departure was prompted, in part, by the shortage of courtrooms and 
physical shortcomings at the downtown county courthouse. McConnell said that, 
although she has lined up temporary courtrooms for the three new judges' first 
days, she isn't sure where they will be hearing cases after that. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan, 49, has been with the district attorney's office since 1969. He went to 
both college and law school at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 52, has been the assistant city attorney since 1988. For 17 years 
before that, he was a deputy city attorney specializing in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Before he joined the city attorney's office, Johnson practiced law with a San 
Diego law firm, the state Department of Transportation, a Riverside law firm 
and the state Public Utilities Commission. He is a 1963 graduate of the 
University of California, Berkeley, law school. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, 50, who said he expects to work at the family court, has been a partner 
since 1986 in the San Diego-area law firm of Mason &amp; Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
He was a partner or had worked at other area firms since 1971. Mason served a 
one-year stint, in 1970, with the San Diego city attorney's office, after 
graduating the year before from California Western law school. 
</P>
<P>
The two deputy district attorneys Deukmejian picked for the Municipal Court 
were Charles G. Rogers and Lantz Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, 39, tabbed for the San Diego Municipal Court, had been assigned to the 
San Diego Metropolitan Task Force, known primarily for its investigation of a 
series of prostitute killings. 
</P>
<P>
Except for two years with an area law firm, Rogers has been with the district 
attorney's office since 1976. He is a 1974 graduate of the University of Denver 
law school. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 45, picked for the El Cajon Municipal Court, has been a deputy district 
attorney since 1976. His prior work included four years as a coordinator with 
the county's Law and Justice Agency and three years as an analyst with the San 
Diego city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
He is a 1974 University of San Diego law school graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers fills a new position. Lewis replaces Ronald S. Prager, who moved to the 
San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court judges earn $94,344 and Municipal Court judges $86,157 annually.

CITY ASKS FOR SECRET MERGER PROCEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego, in a strange twist, has asked that the public be 
excluded from depositions of former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric board of 
directors members Charles (Red) Scott and Morris Sievert when those proceedings 
resume Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Sievert are the two San Diego businessmen who resigned from 
SDG&amp;E's board in 1988 to protest a proposed merger with Southern California 
Edison. During a previous deposition, Scott alleged that Edison executives 
offered bribes to SDG&amp;E board members in order to win approval of the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
The city last year agreed to postpone further depositions after the utilities 
alleged that city attorneys were directing Scott and Sievert to testify about 
business dealings that, under California law, constitute proprietary 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The depositions were put on hold with the expectation that a Public Utilities 
Commission law judge would eventually rule on whether testimony by the two 
businessmen was indeed privileged. However, PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn 
Carew has yet to rule on whether specific documents that the two former board 
members will discuss during the depositions are covered by confidentiality 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which has asked the PUC to open its continuing review of SDG&amp;E's 
proposed merger with Edison, is "between a rock and a hard place," acknowledged 
Les Girard, a deputy city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent a decision as to the confidentiality of the documents, the depositions 
have to be closed to protect everyone's interests," said William L. Pettingill, 
a deputy city attorney. "Naturally, you'd think it was the utilities bringing 
this motion. We'd like for the hearings to be open." 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, Carew has declined to immediately rule on a request by the 
San Diego-based Copley Press that would make confidential documents submitted 
by the two utilities -- and testimony offered during the upcoming depositions 
-- available to newspaper reporters and the public. The Copley Press owns the 
morning San Diego Union and afternoon Tribune newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only intervenors in the PUC review who have signed non-disclosure 
agreements enjoy access to the supposedly confidential papers. Similarly, only 
those who have signed the agreements will be admitted to the Scott and Sievert 
depositions. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the PUC, attorneys for the Copley papers argued that the 
Scott and Sievert depositions "should be opened to the public or, 
alternatively, should be stayed pending a complete determination" of whether 
the confidentiality issue is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Carew declined to postpone the hearings. In a written order, 
she indicated that the confidentiality questions raised by the Scott and 
Sievert depositions will be settled later.

WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS -- CLOUD SEEDERS MAKE SURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He may not be as successful as Charles (Rainmaker) Hatfield, but, during 
rainstorms, Dan Keady is in the clouds in a twin-engine plane flying over the 
mountains near Julian, trying to create more rain, not flood the city. 
</P>
<P>
Keady is a pilot for Atmospherics Inc., a research and cloud-seeding company. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an almost four-year drought, San Diego decided to spend $150,000 to 
fund a seeding program with the Sweetwater and Helix water districts. The city 
hired the Fresno-based company for the pilot program last February and is 
continuing the program this winter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1916, when San Diego was suffering from a drought, the city hired Hatfield 
and agreed to pay him $10,000 to fill the Lake Morena reservoir. Hatfield set 
up towers near the lake and on them mixed chemicals that produced periodic 
explosions of vapor. Seventeen days after he began, 11.4 inches of rain fell. 
</P>
<P>
The lake flooded, dams broke, houses and bridges were destroyed. Residents sued 
the city for $3.5 million in damages. And the city refused to pay Hatfield for 
his services. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the city hopes simply to get the maximum local water production and 
prevent the need for imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until the heavy rain in March of last year, we were looking at a three-year 
drought" and started looking for an alternative water supply, said Frank 
Maitski, senior civil engineer for the city's Water Utilities Department. 
</P>
<P>
The areas targeted for seeding are over three watersheds in the mountains near 
Julian, Maitski said. They cover about 600 square miles and were chosen because 
the water levels are low, he said. The city hopes the seeding will increase the 
seasonal rainfall by 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
During the four storms this season, some of the seeding has been successful and 
some has not, said Rand Allan, a meteorologist for Atmospherics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
How cloud seeding affected this year's rainfall will not be known until the 
rainy season ends and an evaluation is made, Allan said. The rainy season is 
from December to April. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Weather Service, the total rainfall for the season is 
3.94 inches at Lindbergh Field. The mountain areas totaled 8.3 inches, a city 
flood control spokesman said. The season is measured from July 1 to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain areas usually get two or three times more rain than the city because, 
as the storm rises, it is forced to dump more rain, said Wilbur Shigehara, a 
National Weather Service forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
Allan said the goal last year was to find out if this area was conducive to 
cloud seeding. He said that Atmospherics wanted to investigate the clouds to 
see if they met seeding criteria, which they did. 
</P>
<P>
There were only two storms last year in San Diego, which made it difficult to 
determine if cloud seeding increased rainfall, Allan said. "We only seeded for 
about one-third of the season because we were hired late," he said. They 
started Feb. 15 and finished April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Cloud seeding was discovered in 1946 at the General Electric Laboratory in 
Schenectady, N.Y., by Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer, the father of modern weather 
modification. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific experiments are now leading to techniques that can predict the 
results of cloud seeding, if the seeding is done properly. Comparisons are made 
between the water levels of areas targeted for seeding and the unseeded areas 
to determine if cloud seeding was successful. Researchers say there is 
generally a 5% increase in rainfall when clouds are seeded. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, various inorganic and organic materials have been used to create 
more rain. The most common, silver iodide, can be released from either 
ground-based generators or from an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Cloud seeding during winter storms takes place when clouds are formed as moist 
air rises and cools, and as they move from west to east across the mountains. 
Many clouds are inefficient precipitators and retain about 90% of their 
moisture. 
</P>
<P>
When the radar shows that rain is moving in, Allan said, he monitors the storm 
to detect its most intense parts and sends Keady up. Keady seeds the clouds 20 
minutes before the storm reaches the target area. It takes about 30 minutes for 
rain to reach the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Keady said that seedable clouds must have a temperature of 23 degrees or lower. 
They also need supercooled liquid water, which is water below the freezing 
point. The water is unfrozen because it does not have anything to freeze onto, 
he said. That is where Keady comes in. 
</P>
<P>
He releases silver iodide pre-mixed with either magnesium or acetone. Silver 
iodide is used because it is chemically similar to an ice crystal. Twenty 
flares containing silver iodide and magnesium are positioned on each side of 
the turbo-charged aircraft, and acetone and silver iodide are poured into a 
wing-tip generator. 
</P>
<P>
With the flip of a switch, Keady ignites the flares and generator, which burns 
the chemicals. An exhaust gas containing millions of microscopic particles is 
released directly into the storm. The process continues for about an hour and a 
half, Keady said. 
</P>
<P>
The object is to coax the extra liquid out of the clouds to intensify the 
rainfall, Keady said. The super-cooled water attracts particles to form ice 
crystals. These crystals grow rapidly until they are heavy enough to fall 
through the clouds, melting into raindrops on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide a means for the extra water to get to the ground, when there is a 
shortage of coalescing material," Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the clouds are working at 100% efficiency and converting all the 
supercooled liquid to rain, then we will not seed," Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
Keady said that, if ice does not form on the plane's wings, he knows that "it 
is a good storm," and that it will rain heavy and long. If ice does form, then 
he seeds. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, Allan said that visually the clouds seemed riped for 
seeding. He said there were some fairly healthy thunderstorms in the northern 
portion of the target area. Keady went up at about 12:20 p.m. and planned to 
stay up for about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Keady seeded twice Saturday, and early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeding conditions were good early Saturday evening because we found a steady 
amount of liquid water in the clouds," Allan said. "But late Saturday and early 
Sunday, we did little seeding and stopped when the cold front moved through." 
</P>
<P>
However, late Sunday morning the seeding conditions improved, and another 
flight Monday afternoon also proved successful, Allan said. But another storm 
that hit Tuesday afternoon produced only scattered showers containing little 
liquid water. The seeding flight proved unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
From midnight Tuesday to 3 a.m. Wednesday, seeding conditions were good. 
</P>
<P>
The silver iodide that the plane drops is not hazardous to the environment, 
Keady said, because the amount released is so small. He said he typically uses 
about 100 grams of silver iodide per flight. 
</P>
<P>
He has enough chemicals during each flight to seed the clouds for four hours. 
Twenty grams of silver iodide are in each flare that burns for about six 
minutes, Keady said. And the generator releases 42 grams of silver iodide per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
John Lease, who heads a research group at the Bureau of Reclamation in Denver, 
said the silver iodide used in cloud seeding is added in such small amounts 
that it cannot be detected. He is chief of the Water Augmentation Group, which 
does environmental studies of weather modification. 
</P>
<P>
Data shows that cloud seeding during winter rainstorms increases rainfall by 
10% or 15% for the season, Lease said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the concern that heavy rainfall may cause flooding, Lease said, most 
cities have a suspension criterion to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Keady said that their contract with San Diego has a suspension criterion that 
prohibits him from seeding under certain conditions. The city can stop him from 
seeding at any time, especially if flash floods are expected, or if there are 
hazardous conditions such as back-to-back storms. 
</P>
<P>
The flooding problems are mainly in the city, where the ground is saturated and 
there is a lot of pavement, Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We let a heavy shower on (Wednesday) morning go by without seeding the clouds, 
because of the severity of the thunderstorm, in order to avoid concerns of 
extra-heavy rainfall. We didn't want it to flood, especially in the section of 
the foothills area near the target areas." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't view ourselves as rainmakers," said Allan. "We can't go out, and send 
(Keady) up to spray silver iodide and expect it to rain. We have to wait for 
the right conditions and increase the efficiency of a storm."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man charged with robbing 17 stores, mostly "Blockbuster" video 
shops, pleaded innocent Wednesday at his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Cruz Loza, 31, is accused of the 17 robberies that occurred between 
Sept. 26 and Dec. 28, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Timothy Tower ordered bail set at $250,000 at the 
request of Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Anear. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Loza was arrested in late December by U.S. Customs agents at the border as he 
was returning from Tijuana. Anear said Loza's car license plate had been tagged 
as belonging to a suspect in the robbery series. 
</P>
<P>
Anear said Loza was paroled in April, 1989, after serving a sentence for 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, the video chain had announced a $5,000 reward for 
information leading to the robber's arrest and conviction.

SICK WHALE IS RESPONDING TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Knootka, an 8,500-pound killer whale suffering from a rare fungal infection, is 
slowly responding to treatment with an experimental drug usually used on 
humans, Sea World officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Knootka, one of Sea World's two adult killer whales, became the 
first whale ever to receive itraconazole, an experimental drug that is approved 
for human use in Europe. Today, after about five weeks of treatment, her 
appetite has returned, a lesion on her tongue has disappeared and she appears 
to have more energy than before, Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's definitely an improved animal," he said. "She appears not to be 
deteriorating. She obviously has the will to carry on." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McBain said, Knootka's high percentage of body fat has made her 
unexpectedly well-suited for treatment with itraconazole. McBain had consulted 
with physicians who had used the drug on human patients, so he knew that the 
drug had an affinity for fat cells. But it had not occurred to McBain that 
Knootka's blubber would make her an ideal patient. 
</P>
<P>
"Physicians remark that you virtually never treat a human being with a systemic 
infection who is fat," McBain said. "By the time they come in for treatment, 
they're compromised and worn down. But we have a patient that's far different 
than that -- she's got a lot of fat." 
</P>
<P>
By absorbing itraconazole in her fat cells, Knootka has been able to store the 
drug internally -- so much so, in fact, that McBain halted her daily treatments 
about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She is still getting medication, but not from us," he explained, comparing 
Knootka's way of storing the drug to a time-release capsule. "She appears to 
have stored enough in her blubber that, ever since we've stopped giving it, it 
has been slowly released into her blood stream." 
</P>
<P>
McBain said Knootka's survival was cause for celebration, but said he is 
cautious in his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a long ways to go, and we feel her prognosis is still definitely 
guarded. We all know that she can still go any time, and we couldn't stop 
that," he said. "But we've gone farther than we thought we might have already. 
A month has passed, and she's still here. If we were losing the battle, she 
wouldn't be."

SCRIPPS, MIRAMAR BAN SEEKS TO PHASE IN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, moving to address the overflow traffic and 
crowded schools that are the pre-eminent concern of many District 5 residents, 
won San Diego City Council support Tuesday to consider a building moratorium 
that would cover all of Scripps Ranch and Miramar Ranch North. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, the council directed city staff members to prepare an 
ordinance that would allow a moratorium, which theoretically could stop 
construction of much of the 3,360-home Miramar Ranch North project, 376 homes 
in the so-called "county island" that is now part of Scripps Ranch and other 
small Scripps Ranch developments. The ordinance is due back to the council in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I am dead serious when I talk about forcing developers in the Miramar Ranch 
North and Scripps Miramar Ranch planning areas to sit down and work as a team 
to come to some kind of resolution about the facilities and some kind of 
phasing plan" for development, Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council agreed to consider the notion, Bernhardt's action 
attracted no words of support among her colleagues and may amount to little 
more than saber rattling, given doubts expressed by some of them about a 
blanket moratorium. Council members Judy McCarty and Ron Roberts expressed 
concerns about the approach. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt handily defeated two-term incumbent Councilman Ed Struiksma last 
November after running a campaign that emphasized controlling growth along the 
Interstate 15 corridor and providing residents there the parks, schools and 
roads many say are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt's proposal grew from a resolution approved Jan. 2 by the Scripps 
Miramar Ranch Planning Group, demanding that the city stop issuing building 
permits for two residential projects in the "county island" because residents 
of the 676 new homes soon to be built there would tax the area's overburdened 
roads, schools and water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The council last April rescinded a development agreement for the adjacent 
Miramar Ranch North project, whose developers would have provided some of those 
facilities as well as a crucial section of the South Poway Parkway (Alternate 
8A) that is slated to route as many as 25,000 cars daily from Poway to I-15. 
</P>
<P>
With the project in limbo, the council should use its police powers to halt the 
county island developments being planned by the Donald L. Bren Co. and Brennan 
Katkov Development Corp., the planning group contends. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the two developers are completing the widening and realigning of 
now-closed Pomerado Road, so Poway will begin pressuring the City Council to 
rescind its commitment to keep the road closed until South Poway Parkway is 
built, said Jon Clark, chairman of the planning group's county island 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Paul Peterson, representing the two developers, said they already 
have been issued 488 of the planned 676 development permits and cannot legally 
be stopped from building the homes. He said, however, that the developers might 
agree not to build all the homes this year. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory maintained that roads and water supply for 
the area are adequate. The city has no control over provision of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt agreed that the two developments cannot be halted, but proposed the 
building ban on an additional 376 homes in the county island, Miramar Ranch 
North and in-fill development in Scripps Ranch.

release of three aircraft technicians detained for nearly two weeks. The three 
Americans had completed a year of training Chadians to service a Lockheed C-130 
transport plane bought by Chad. They then packed up and destroyed some 
documents, including manuals for the plane, that Chadian officials thought 
belonged to Chad.

Gritty volcanic ash fell with the snow in sparsely settled parts of Alaska 
after an overnight eruption of Redoubt Volcano, and scientists said more 
eruptions may occur without warning. "Ash came down with the snow," said Joyce 
Logan in Skwentna, a small town northwest of Anchorage that is more than 100 
miles from the volcano. The 10,197-foot mountain rumbled briefly before it 
erupted, sending a plume of ash 38,000 feet skyward, geologists at the Alaska 
Volcano Observatory reported.

Thirteen boys ranging in age from 14 to 17 have been arrested and are being 
held without bail for investigation of the slaying of a 15-year-old in this 
East Bay city. Detective Mike Warren said police will recommend that all the 
youths be charged with murder, even though only one stabbed Alex Calderon. 
"They all participated in this incident in one form or another and under the

Stanford University officials proposed to ban alcohol consumption at all 
Stanford athletic events. The proposal was prompted in part by the 27 
alcohol-related arrests at the Stanford-UC Berkeley football game in November. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has been the only school in the Pacific-10 athletic conference to 
allow spectators to bring alcohol inside a stadium. Three years ago, Stanford 
banned hard liquor at games and limited each person over 21 to carrying in one 
six-pack of beer. The proposal would also prohibit advertising of alcohol at 
university events, declare anyone convicted of drunk driving ineligible for 
university parking permits and ban the purchase of alcohol with student fees 
collected by the university. Final approval by President Donald Kennedy is 
expected later this year. "We're probably at the point now where we are better 
off saying 'no alcohol.' I find it hard to believe that people can't go three 
hours without a drink," said Marv Herrington, the university's director of 
public safety.

A 250,000-gallon sewage spill at a regional treatment plant flooded several 
streets and prompted authorities to quarantine an eight-mile stretch of 
beachfront. Officials at the Fountain Valley Treatment Plant said they were not 
sure what caused sewage to begin backing up, sending effluent spewing out of 
manholes on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
All systems at the plant were back to normal within an hour, but sewage had 
spilled into storm drains leading to the Santa Ana River and reached the sea. 
"The good news is there's no sewage spilling right now," said Blake Anderson, 
technical services director for the Sanitation District of Orange County. "But 
we're baffled. We're still trying to locate the cause." County health officials 
shut down a stretch of beach between the Newport Pier and Beach Boulevard in 
Huntington Beach. A spokesman for the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa said 
sewage spewed out of floor drains in the basement, which houses dressing rooms, 
but there was no damage to costumes.

YAROSLAVSKY THREATENS TO BAN DEVELOPMENT ON VENTURA BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky accused developers and city 
planners Wednesday of stalling a plan to control Ventura Boulevard growth, 
warning that he will try to block all development on the boulevard if the 
proposal does not reach the city Planning Commission by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged that the consideration of this plan has been delayed," 
Yaroslavsky told an overflow crowd of about 250 at a meeting of the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the planning commission does not hear this case by the end of February, 
then I will introduce a motion for an ordinance that will stop all development 
on Ventura Boulevard," he said, drawing heavy applause. "That's a message to 
the Planning Commission." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do a moratorium," he said. "I don't want to have to resort to 
radical steps, but I will respond to radical stall tactics." 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission had been scheduled to hear the plan in November. The 
hearing was first delayed until this month. City planning officials now say 
legal difficulties will postpone it until February. 
</P>
<P>
The plan -- which was shaped by city planners, consultants and a citizens 
advisory committee -- calls for construction restrictions and traffic 
improvements along a 17-mile stretch of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, 
Sherman Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists make about 70,000 trips a day on the busy thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no controls on development, about 40 million square feet of 
additional commercial development could be built, generating 150,000 more 
vehicular trips, which would result in round-the-clock traffic jams, according 
to planners. 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes limiting development to 8.6 million square feet of commercial 
space. With upgraded traffic signals, street widening and other improvements -- 
to be paid for by assessments on builders -- the boulevard could handle an 
additional 29,000 trips a day by the year 2010, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has provoked arguments among developers, community leaders and 
homeowner groups since 1987. Property owners say it is too restrictive on 
development and too expensive for builders. Homeowners complain that it is not 
restrictive enough. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan may be revised in other hearings before it reaches the Los 
Angeles City Council for final approval.

SECOND AREA BARRICADED IN DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police barricaded a second Sepulveda neighborhood Wednesday and posted signs 
saying "Secure Area" instead of "Narcotics Enforcement Zone." 
</P>
<P>
But the purpose of the roadblocks remained the same as it was in November when 
police put up the "Narcotics Enforcement Zone" signs in the nearby Columbus 
Avenue area -- to keep drive-by drug buyers off residential streets, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks now surround two nearby neighborhoods that are separated by 
Sepulveda Boulevard, which remains a through street. The entire 20-square-block 
area is bounded by Nordhoff Street on the north, Parthenia Street on the south, 
Burnett Avenue on the east and Orion Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the signs in both neighborhoods was changed after landlords said 
they were worried that prospective tenants would shun apartments in areas 
labeled as drug zones, said Greg Nelson, press deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, 
who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want it to seem like a war zone," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orion Avenue area appeared peaceful Wednesday as Wachs and police officials 
assembled there to announce the new street closures, which they said will 
remain in effect for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
However, the area has long been known as a violent drive-by drug market, said 
Capt. Mark D. Stevens of the Los Angeles Police Department. Stevens said 
erecting barricades around the nearby Columbus Avenue area has dramatically 
reduced crime there and should work equally well in the Orion Avenue 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the police district that includes the Columbus Avenue area, 
the number of aggravated assaults, which often are associated with drug 
activity, decreased 34% during the first week the barricades were erected 
compared to the same period the year before, Stevens said. There were 15 
aggravated assaults during the week of Nov. 7, 1989, compared to 23 the year 
before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had almost a complete absence of drug dealing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some police officials have said the drop in crime comes at the expense of 
nearby areas, which attract the displaced drug dealers. Shortly after Columbus 
Avenue was blocked off, narcotics officers arrested more than 40 drug buyers in 
a two-day period on nearby Orion Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens defended the barricading technique Wednesday, saying that narcotics 
traffic had always been heavy on Orion Avenue. Residents who happened by the 
news conference Wednesday agreed, citing a long history of disturbances by drug 
dealers who set up shop on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Reed, principal of Our Lady of Peace, a Catholic school in the 
barricaded zone, said police officers have frequently used the school library 
to spy on drug dealers before arresting them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've even had teachers approached at stop signs," Reed said. "The barricades 
are worth any traffic inconvenience they bring." 
</P>
<P>
While the barricades are up, vehicles will be able to enter the area only at 
the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street except for the 40 school 
buses that pick up children at the Langdon Avenue Elementary School, which will 
be permitted to enter through other intersections monitored by police. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Jackson, who manages an apartment building on Orion Avenue, also 
supported the barricades. He said he was shot in the abdomen Christmas Eve as 
he attempted to settle an argument between tenants he suspected were involved 
in drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
"The barricades will be a big help to us because the dealers will move 
elsewhere," Jackson said. "It's selfish and it's sad, but let someone else, 
somewhere else worry about the problem for a change."

SYLMAR LED L.A. GROWTH IN THE 1980S; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE ONCE-RURAL COMMUNITY GREW 30.7%. 
NEIGHBORING ARLETA WAS RANKED THIRD IN THE CITY AT 18.7%.

Sylmar -- once viewed as the quiet, rural outback of Los Angeles -- was the 
fastest-growing community in the city during the 1980s, with a 30.7% population 
increase for the decade and an almost equal growth rate in housing 
construction, according to city figures released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The community has topped the city's population growth every year since 1982. 
Its population surged from 41,922 in 1980 to 54,779 in 1989, city planners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, which experienced a development boom in private and military housing 
in the mid-1980s, was the second fastest growing area in Los Angeles in the 
decade just ended, with a 21.7% population increase. Arleta, which is next to 
Sylmar, ranked third with an 18.7% growth rate, city planning statistics 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
The population of the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles grew 12.2% 
from 1980 to 1989, rising from 1,017,365 people to 1,142,447. 
</P>
<P>
The overall population of Los Angeles grew 11.6% between 1980 and 1989 to more 
than 3.3 million people, according to the estimates. The figures, released by 
the city Planning Department, are based on census data, statistics from the 
city's Building and Safety Department and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley was the scene of the biggest housing boom in the city 
in the last decade with a 14.8% increase to 58,915 new dwelling units. Planners 
said 48% of all new housing in the city was built in the Valley, which is home 
to about a third of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
The accelerated population growth in the northeast Valley, which includes 
Sylmar and Arleta, was spurred by the completion of the Foothill Freeway in 
1981 and the availability of large swaths of undeveloped land. Almost overnight 
a remote section of the city became easily accessible by freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments and condominiums now flank Sylmar's busy Foothill Boulevard, once a 
two-lane road bordered by sprawling ranch houses and stables. Spacious tract 
homes have crept into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom has prompted a series of interim development control 
measures in Sylmar, which is the first of the city's 35 planning areas to 
undergo general plan revisions to draft new growth control regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the city as a whole, population has increased at a strong, 
healthy rate," said City Planner Jeffrey Beckerman. "But certain areas 
individually have grown much faster than others." 
</P>
<P>
The three most crowded areas of Los Angeles are the Westlake, Wilshire and 
South-Central districts with an average of 47, 28 and 23 people respectively 
living on one acre of land. By contrast, there is plenty of elbow room in 
Bel-Air and Brentwood, where an average of only two residents share one acre of 
land, and Sunland, where there are three people per acre. 
</P>
<P>
The most densely populated Valley communities are North Hollywood with 15 
residents per acre, followed by Van Nuys with 14. After Sunland, residents in 
Sun Valley and Porter Ranch have the most space, with five residents per acre.

SNOW CAUSES 16 CRASHES, CLOSING FREEWAY AT RUSH HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Antelope Valley Freeway was briefly closed Wednesday because snow and ice 
caused 16 accidents, including a 10-car pileup, in less than an hour during the 
morning commuting period, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were reported, but tangled cars littered a five-mile 
stretch of the freeway, which was closed from Angeles Forest Highway north to 
Palmdale Boulevard, CHP Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the area where the snow hit hardest," said Siordia, who noted that ice 
conditions were listed as a cause in all the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We started getting snow at 5:15 a.m. People started crashing by 6," Siordia 
said. "They were driving too fast for the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
By 6:30 a.m. the CHP had reports of 16 separate accidents, four of which 
included injuries ranging from minor to moderate, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
Two women suffered moderate injuries when the car in which they were riding 
spun out on ice on a bridge near the Pearblossom Highway exit and struck a van, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
They were transported to Palmdale General Hospital and were the only accident 
victims hospitalized, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten cars collided in a chain-reaction pileup in the southbound lanes near 
Angeles Forest Highway, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP shut down the four-lane freeway at 7 a.m., Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we had the closure was the number of accidents," Siordia said. "The 
accidents were blocking the lanes. People were driving into the center divider 
to get around and were getting stuck. We had to close it down until the tow 
trucks could go in and get everybody out." 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers began escorting commuters along the freeway at 8 a.m., Siordia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., after the ice and snow had melted, all lanes were reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said the accidents and closure made a miserable and long commute for 
many residents heading south to Los Angeles during the high point of the 
morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Antelope Valley, our rush hour is an hour earlier than in Los Angeles," 
he said. "It was bumper to bumper when these accidents started happening." 
</P>
<P>
Siordia said the Antelope Valley Freeway is usually closed only once or twice a 
year because of weather conditions.

HIDDEN HILLS VOTES TO PURSUE ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a poll showing that residents largely oppose a plan for lower-cost 
housing in wealthy Hidden Hills, the town's City Council voted Wednesday to 
push ahead with an annexation action related to the plan, without deciding the 
fate of the housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the housing plan the council supported in recent months, 46 lower-cost 
units for senior citizens would be built on part of 25 acres of adjoining 
county land the city would annex. 
</P>
<P>
A developer would be allowed to build nine luxury homes on 20 acres inside the 
community's gates, and construct the lower-cost project and commercial office 
space on the remaining five acres outside the gates. The luxury homes would be 
accessible through Hidden Hills' network of private roads, but the senior 
citizens' homed and the commercial area would not. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results, announced Tuesday, showed that about two-thirds of those who 
responded opposed the housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But council members Warren H. McCament, Colleen Hartman and Mayor Chris K. Van 
Peski questioned whether the poll accurately reflected the town's opinion, 
noting that only 410 of about 1,100 registered voters took part. 
</P>
<P>
Council members H. Brian Herdeg and Kathleen D. Bartizal said they believed the 
poll was accurate. Herdeg said he thought many voters lacked information. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0 Wednesday, with Bartizal abstaining, to continue with 
the annexation proposal, which is scheduled to be heard next Wednesday by a 
county commission. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the vote was not a decision on the future of the housing 
plan.

EL SEGUNDO OKS CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Segundo City Council has passed the city's first municipal campaign 
finance ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, approved 3 to 2 Tuesday, limits the amount of individual 
contributions in an election and confines donations to a three-month election 
period. It does not limit the amount a candidate may contribute to his or her 
own election, nor the amount a candidate's election committee may spend. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scot D. Dannen, who proposed the ordinance, said it is intended to 
combat "war chests" and that it "puts out in the open" sources of financial 
support. He said many other cities already have such controls. The ordinance is 
modeled after one in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which takes effect in 30 days, places a $250 ceiling on the amount 
individuals or groups may contribute to a candidate, bars contributions under 
assumed names and limits the total amount of anonymous contributions to $1,000. 
It also confines donations to a three-month election period, starting when 
nomination papers can be filed and ending when polls close on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman H. R. (Bob) Anderson voted against the measure, contending that it 
was "pushed through" the council without sufficient public participation. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Alan West also voted against it after objecting to the exclusion of 
volunteer campaign workers from ordinance controls. The measure requires 
organizations or individuals who are not controlled by a candidate to disclose 
expenditures made on behalf of or against any candidate. City Atty. Leland C. 
Dolley advised the council that work done by people without charge may not be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
J. B. Wise, who said he will run for council in April, objected to the 
ordinance's adoption without the involvement of a citizens committee. He also 
objected to a provision that updated campaign disclosure documents must be 
filed with the city by noon on the Friday before an election. He argued that 
the information could be used for last-minute flyers attacking candidates who 
would not have time to respond before the election. He suggested a noon 
deadline on Election Day. GERALD FARIS

JUDGE CLEARS MOBIL REFINERY OF OBSTRUCTING TORRANCE PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil, which is embroiled in a series of disputes with the city of Torrance, 
reveled this week as it extended its string of legal victories in South Bay 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the city will now tire of bringing meritless criminal actions, which 
only serve to harass Mobil and waste the city's limited resources," said Mobil 
spokesman Jim Carbonetti. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, South Bay Municipal Court Judge Josh Fredericks ruled that Mobil 
Oil and a former refinery executive are innocent of criminal charges that they 
obstructed a Torrance Fire Department investigation into a July 15, 1988, 
explosion that killed one man and injured two others. 
</P>
<P>
After prosecution witnesses had testified, Mobil urged the judge to rule in its 
favor, arguing that the city had not made a case. Fredericks agreed and entered 
a verdict of not guilty for Mobil and retired Mobil employee Thomas Gregory on 
the two misdemeanor counts. At the time of the accident, Gregory was the 
second-ranking manager at the Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the way this thing went," said Carbonetti. 
</P>
<P>
City prosecutors could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the accident, Harbor City resident Winston Alexander Jones, 30, an employee 
of the contract firm Cal Cat Chem Co. of Benicia, died instantly when the tank 
he was on top of exploded. David Moustofi, 32, of Long Beach, suffered second- 
and third-degree burns over 75% of his body. Jerry Lekberg, 41, of Oakland, was 
burned over 5% of his body. The three were processing foul-smelling sludge from 
a water tank. 
</P>
<P>
The counts that were dismissed this week stemmed from accusations by Torrance 
Fire Inspector Robert Maag that a Mobil employee had prevented him from taking 
pictures shortly after the explosion and that several Mobil employees 
interfered with interviews he was conducting with potential witnesses. Maag 
added in a report that Mobil employees had blocked Torrance police from the 
explosion site and that they had not honored yellow "caution" tape that was 
supposed to seal off the accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
Those counts were part of a larger misdemeanor case -- dealing with the cause 
of the accident -- that the city had filed against Mobil, Gregory, refinery 
Manager Wyman Robb, Cal Cat Chem and three of its top executives. All were 
charged with misdemeanor counts of violating state safety standards. Robb and 
Gregory were also charged with inducing others to violate safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 30, Municipal Court Judge Thomas Allen dismissed the state safety 
charges against Mobil and Robb, but retained them against Cal Cat Chem Co. and 
its executives. In his ruling, Allen said that the charges only applied to the 
direct employer of the accident victims, which was Cal Cat Chem. Mobil had 
hired Cal Cat Chem to process sludge at its refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental crimes unit of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office is appealing Allen's ruling to Superior Court. However, the case against 
Cal Cat Chem is proceeding. A hearing on when to set trial is scheduled for 
Feb. 7 in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
The city also suffered a setback in a misdemeanor case against Mobil stemming 
from a fire on Aug. 5, 1988, in which one contract employee was burned over 40% 
of his body and another was injured. The fire was caused when the worker 
mistakenly opened a pipe and flammable hydrocarbon liquids spewed onto hot 
pipes below. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30, Allen dismissed the charge, ruling that civil penalties levied by 
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration preempted any state 
criminal charges. Torrance Prosecutor J. D. Lord said he would appeal that 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 4, Lord accused Allen of bias and forced the judge off a third case, 
one that cited Mobil in 170 misdemeanor counts. The massive case stemmed from 
an intensive OSHA audit of the refinery. That case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Also pending is a civil suit brought by the city against Mobil alleging that 
its refinery is a public nuisance and hazard and should be subject to increased 
city regulation.

STUDENT ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition, I completely agree with Byron 
Dillon's sentiments that the dire problems of our own country, such as drugs, 
AIDS, racism and homelessness, must be dealt with immediately. But his 
criticism of our organization is unfair for precisely the reasons he cites 
(letter, Jan. 2). 
</P>
<P>
It is very true that compared to a sit-in at the South African Consulate, 
working for the homeless is unglamorous and yields little publicity. This is 
exactly why people such as Dillon have never heard about our efforts to help 
Los Angeles' homeless, such as our clothing drive to raise emergency supplies 
for the men and women of Skid Row who lost what little they had when the 
homeless arts and cultural center Another Planet burned down last summer. He 
has also never heard about the educational anti-racism workshops the coalition 
has sponsored for high school, junior high and college students, or our work 
for the women's rights movement. I could give many more examples. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Student Coalition alone will never solve all the problems of the 
world, or even Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Student Coalition members see themselves as part of a global 
student community. To be disruptive to the actions of the South African 
government's representatives in our own city is what we had in mind. Saving the 
life of a South African citizen is no less worthy than saving the life of an 
American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
And if the Student Coalition can continue to bring together youth from all 
cultural backgrounds, as we have been, and uniting them together in a common 
goal, we are making the first big step in eliminating the racial barriers of 
our own society.

TICKET THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article on airline ticket thefts kept me until the last paragraph (Part A, 
Jan. 9). It was at the end, however, that I laughed out loud at the complaints 
regarding airlines' inability to properly check tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines say they use profiles to spot bad guys. Joe Whitby of British Airways 
wants a magnetic strip on each ticket. Give us a break! 
</P>
<P>
Haven't any of these overpaid security experts ever heard of bar codes? What 
could be simpler than running a small light pen over a bar code? Airlines spend 
millions on their computer systems. Can't they find a simple software package 
that'll take the bar code readout and compare it to the list of stolen tickets? 
</P>
<P>
I have no sympathy for the airlines that could implement an instantaneous 
ticket check procedure right now. Instead they moan and groan about their 
losses!

LANDFILL GROUP APOLOGIZES FOR FLYER MISSTATING DUMP'S SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of landfill firms trying to win support for a garbage dump in Elsmere 
Canyon has circulated a flyer throughout Los Angeles County incorrectly 
implying that the Santa Clarita City Council has endorsed the landfill proposed 
for construction just outside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kalpakoff, president of the California Disposal Assn., apologized for the 
flyer Wednesday, saying the trade group would clarify the city's position in a 
later mailing. "I'll make sure it's corrected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has repeatedly said it will not officially support or oppose the 
dump until it reviews an environmental impact report on the project expected 
this spring. Mayor Jo Anne Darcy called the flyer "pretty presumptuous." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no agreement," Darcy added. "It's not a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Jill Klajic, a local anti-dump activist, said the flyer damages the efforts of 
Santa Clarita citizens who oppose the landfill. "This is awful, this is just 
awful," Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 flyers were mailed last month to the media, elected officials, 
chambers of commerce and community leaders in the county, said Hy Weitzman, 
executive director of the association. The one-page flyer touted a tentative 
agreement between the Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of 
Supervisors to operate a dump in Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears now that there is a light at the end of the garbage crisis tunnel," 
the flyer began. "If all goes as planned, and there are no political delays 
caused by opposing groups, we could have additional landfill space available as 
early as 1995." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer continues: "The proposed new landfill will be located in Elsmere 
Canyon, near the city of Santa Clarita. Five entities are involved: the city 
and county of Los Angeles, the County Sanitation Districts, the BKK Corporation 
and the city of Santa Clarita." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer also says that Santa Clarita would be given land by the city of Los 
Angeles for a city hall site and would be paid for each ton of garbage dumped 
in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer does not mention, however, that Santa Clarita would receive the land 
and money only if the Santa Clarita City Council agrees not to oppose the dump 
or that the council has not approved the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said he was not aware that Santa Clarita had not endorsed the dump and 
said the association did not intend to misrepresent the city. Weitzman said he 
obtained his information for the flyer from the County Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Maguin, head of solid waste management for the Sanitation Districts, said 
the districts are well aware that Santa Clarita has not endorsed the Elsmere 
dump and that the flyer probably resulted from a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman said the California Disposal Assn. is a trade group composed of about 
35 companies in the county and is affiliated with the statewide California 
Refuse Removal Council. The association plans to send out monthly flyers to 
keep local leaders aware of plans for landfills, Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council, meanwhile, has scheduled a public forum to 
discuss the city's options concerning the dump. The forum will be held Jan. 24 
at 6:30 p.m. in the Hart High School auditorium.

Whatever are we to do with these anti-abortionist gadflies? They trample the 
rights of most to intercede where they are wanted the least. Then they whimper 
that their right to violate the law is frustrated by police who, they say, have 
no business shoveling them from the public thoroughfare, like so much refuse, 
given their determination to behave irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
Is there, perhaps, some address to which we can send donations in order to buy 
the LAPD more nunchakus?

PAIN-COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the story regarding the use of pain-compliance techniques 
by the police against the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. The article 
failed to mention some of the techniques used by O.R. to blockade clinic doors 
during a "rescue." 
</P>
<P>
I have witnessed their behavior on two separate occasions. Once in July at a 
Tustin clinic, and again last December in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tustin clinic, pro-choice "clinic defenders" were able to link arms to 
prevent O.R. from gaining control of the door. I saw O.R. attempt to use "human 
battering rams," i.e. groups of protesters (mostly large men) to slam through 
the pro-choice gauntlet (mostly women). I witnessed incidents of kicking, 
shoving, using keys to gouge, all perpetrated by these "nonviolent" terrorists. 
At one point, as a female staff member was trying to enter the clinic, her 
fingernails were broken and her I.D. badges and clothing were torn. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud the police in their use of methods to arrest these self-righteous 
lawbreakers. They are fully warned via a dispersal notice before arrests begin, 
and if they refuse to obey and go quietly, then they get what they deserve.

LET'S PLAY BY THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If American diplomats in any part of the world were detained by foreign 
soldiers, the U.S. government would howl in protest -- and rightly so. So why 
is the Bush Administration letting U.S. troops in Panama do just that to 
diplomats there? 
</P>
<P>
Granted, most of the diplomats who have had run-ins with U.S. soldiers come 
from countries that are less than friendly, like Cuba, Libya and Nicaragua. But 
others represent parties we are on good terms with, like the Vatican, or 
countries that we should be trying to repair relations with in the aftermath of 
the Panama invasion, like Peru. 
</P>
<P>
And while some incidents have stemmed from legitimate military concerns, such 
as searching for hidden weapons, others seem to represent little more than 
bullying. Why is Peru's embassy in Panama City, for example, surrounded by 
heavily armed U.S. troops, sandbags and concertina wire? The official 
explanation is that the armed troops, the sandbags and the wire are aimed at 
intercepting pro-Noriega fugitives trying to get in or out. But it would be a 
lot better all around to assign a detachment of Panamanian police, similar to 
those stationed at Nicaragua's embassy after flare-ups between U.S. troops and 
Sandinista diplomats. Why look for trouble? 
</P>
<P>
The 1961 Vienna Convention guarantees immunity of all diplomatic personnel and 
property. U.S. soldiers in Panama, concerned with military rather than 
diplomatic problems, probably find such rules bothersome. But those rules 
helped U.S. diplomats in many a tense situation, and are likely to be used 
again. This nation has interests all over the world, so the last thing we 
should do is set precedents that could come back to haunt us. The heavy-handed 
tactics used by some American troops in Panama may be doing just that.

GET IT TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE FASTER 
</P>

New Federal Drug Administration dosage recommendations for AZT will facilitate 
the treatment of those with AIDS, a welcome development. But continued FDA 
delays on another crucial use of the same anti-viral drug are blocking 
life-extending treatment for thousands of others infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. That needs an urgent response. 
</P>
<P>
The new dosage for those with AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) is half that 
previously recommended. The change is based on further research that 
demonstrated the efficacy of the reduced dose. This, in turn, opens the 
treatment to those who had to give up the drug because of bad side effects from 
full dosage. With the dosage reduction, cost also is cut in half, a development 
that is helpful at a time of cutbacks in public health spending and the 
increased demand implicit in findings that the drug also is useful in treating 
persons infected with HIV but not yet showing symptoms of AIDS or ARC. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, implementation of early intervention treatments with AZT of 
asymptomatic persons has been delayed by an absence of FDA recommendations on 
dosage. The delays, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National 
Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, are due to "an accumulation of 
multiple bureaucratic and trivial reasons." The institute itself has yet to 
convene a promised conference on the new procedures. And progress has also been 
slowed by delays in publishing the research findings in the scientific journals 
that guide physicians. Excuses aside, the situation was best summarized by Dr. 
Neil Schram, a leading AIDS expert in Los Angeles, when he said "It is an 
outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Peer review is essential before research is reported in medical journals. But 
there are shortcuts in sharing this vital information that the FDA could 
facilitate so that there will be no further delay in using AZT in this new way, 
a way that will buy longer lives for those infected with HIV.

CAPT. CAMPEAU'S TITANIC VOYAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What could possibly bankrupt a department store with such high-energy marketing 
that it will sell you French lessons as easily as a new pair of shoes? Well, 
ask people at Bloomingdale's, which in the East has for years been just another 
way of describing the cutting edge of success. But now, for reasons beyond 
their control, the folks at the popular store most everyone calls "Bloomie's" 
face an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
All it requires, they would tell you, is a takeover artist whose experience is 
in real estate, not retailing, whose ego exceeds his bankroll and who goes so 
deeply into debt to snap you up along with an extended family of other prestige 
stores that he can't meet the mortgage payments. So it was that the federal 
bankruptcy court in Cincinnati this week accepted a petition from entrepreneur 
Robert Campeau's Canadian holding company to protect the stores from their 
creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau paid top dollar, and then some, for Allied Stores Corp. in 1986 and 
Federated Department Stores in 1988. Between them, they owned 260 retail 
outlets with more than 100,000 employees. Stockholders did very well in the 
short run, but only about one in eight ventures into bankruptcy for the purpose 
of reorganization ever succeeds. And so their windfall could mean Bloomie's 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Other, more difficult questions come to mind as courts and creditors start 
their damage assessments. Shouldn't there be a law to prevent such needless 
economic calamity? Probably. But does anybody know what kind of law? Not 
really. The best thinking in Congress homes in on current tax law, which, oddly 
enough, provides a tax break for acquisitions financed by debt but not for 
those using real cash. This is an area definitely worth looking into. 
</P>
<P>
Economic legislation in free-enterprise societies is designed to curb sharp 
practices, not to define or proscribe acceptable levels of risk. Risk in the 
expectation of gain is the very engine of the system, and courts and regulators 
are seldom prepared to tell entrepreneurs how much risk is too much. Much of 
Wall Street saw the Campeau episode as coming close to the finish of the 
high-interest junk-bond financing of the 1980s -- the end of a cycle if not of 
an era. The next cycle would lift the system and the people who depend on it 
for jobs into something better. 
</P>
<P>
This may be valid economic theory, but Congress probably will -- and certainly 
should -- take a look at the whole risky business. Campeau's own management has 
given Congress a place to start looking. The company distributed a memorandum 
Monday saying, among other things, that "Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) no longer 
carries the stigma it once did." Congress should determine whether that wave of 
the wrist over the wreckage also implies that there is not the risk in high 
finance there once was, at least for financiers. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Congress may want to see whether there is some way it can make risk seem 
at least as real as the hope for profit. That is, after all, the point on which 
the system is supposed to balance.

RANCHO P.V. COUNCIL OUSTS CHIEF OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In yet another example of the bitter infighting among Rancho Palos Verdes 
council members, the council Tuesday ousted Planning Commissioner Luella Wike 
from her post. Wike's second four-year term on the commission would have 
expired in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members who opposed Wike did not elaborate on why they wanted 
her off the commission. Before the meeting, Mayor Mel Hughes said only that he 
believed Wike's performance was not "in the best interests of the city." During 
the meeting, Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach accused Wike of being a "little bit 
overzealous" as a commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John McTaggart, however, called Wike's ouster "another example of 
power politics in Rancho Palos Verdes" by the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Wike, who was chairwoman of the commission, did not attend the meeting and 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners serve at the pleasure of the City Council. They decide 
development and zoning matters, but their decisions can be overturned by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council needed to fill three vacancies on the five-member 
Planning Commission. It first voted to force Wike and the commission's only 
other incumbent, Peter Von Hagen, to resign so the council could cast new 
ballots for all five commission members. McTaggart cast the only vote against 
the motion. 
</P>
<P>
After the motion passed, Wike failed to receive enough votes to regain her seat 
when the council majority, made up of Hughes, Bacharach and Doug Hinchliffe, 
did not cast ballots for her. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hagen regained his seat, although council allies McTaggart and Bob Ryan did 
not cast their ballots for him. 
</P>
<P>
McTaggart and Ryan are frequently at odds with the council majority over 
development issues, which have come to dominate local political debate. The 
fate of at least five major building proposals, including two large hotels, is 
expected to be decided this year by planning commissioners and council members. 
</P>
<P>
In past months, Ryan has accused Von Hagen, a developer, of attempting to 
influence city officials on a residential project. Von Hagen acted as the 
landowner's agent for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hagen, who abstained from voting on the project, has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Von Hagen, the council voted to appoint Susan Brooks and Charles 
Hotchkiss to regular four-year terms on the commission. Both have been serving 
in an interim capacity for the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The council also reappointed Robert McNulty, whose second term on the 
commission expired in December, and appointed new member Robert Katherman.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUSTEES TO VOTE ON TEXTBOOK USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo Beach elementary school trustees, at the urging of a conservative 
Christian parents' group, have set a vote on the district's continued use of a 
series of readers some parents deem morbid and anti-Christian, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Impressions," a series of grade-school readers that are the basic reading 
texts for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders in Redondo Beach schools, will come 
before the school board at its Feb. 6 meeting, Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Parras said. 
</P>
<P>
The texts have come under fire nationwide from members of the religious right, 
who disapprove of the inclusion in the books of stories and poems about sorcery 
and magic. Critics have also charged that the books are morbid in tone. A poem 
about swamp pigs who have acquired a "taste for flesh" has drawn particular 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach parents, most of them members of Hope Chapel, demanded last 
month that the district shelve the books. The board took the matter under 
advisement but, in interviews afterward, a majority of the members said they 
had no intention of withdrawing the books. Several said they viewed the request 
as a belated attempt to censor materials that have already been through a 
thorough review process. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, because of the dispute, the board decided to schedule a vote on 
the books "to clear the air," Parras said. The vote will determine whether the 
schools will continue using the "Impressions" readers or scrap them for another 
text.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN IN CAR KILLS BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 19-year-old Inglewood man was shot to death Sunday night by a gunman in a 
passing vehicle as he rode his bicycle along a residential street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Alberto Montes was shot about 9:15 p.m. in the 3800 block of West 105th 
Street as he pulled up alongside a Datsun carrying four men in their early 20s, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the car sped off, Montes struggled to his feet, police said. However, the 
car returned and a passenger shot him again, this time hitting him in the 
heart, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Montes collapsed near a home and was pronounced dead at Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital. Investigators said they had no motive for the 
shooting, although they believe the four men knew Montes.

SURFERS' BUSINESS AIMS FOR PROFITS, CLEAN WATER; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: TWO MIDDLE-AGED SURFERS HAVE FOUNDED A COMPANY TO SELL 
SURF-ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SAVE THE WAVES AND BEACHES THEY USED TO PLAY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For graying surfers Glenn Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the endless summer 
has given way to the winter of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
Their home waves off Malibu beach are almost as crowded as the freeways, and 
the perils of riding them now include not just the dreaded wipeout, but the 
risk of infection from polluted water. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of simply bemoaning what has happened to the waves, Hening and Van 
Hamersveld are doing something about it. They have formed an information and 
licensing company, Geo Surf, which they hope will provide common ground for 
surfers, environmentalists, makers of wet suits, developers and everyone else 
with an interest in the state of the waves and beaches. A portion of any money 
the company makes, the men say, will be used for projects to enhance coastal 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Cowabunga! Corporate surfer activists? Yes, indeed, say Hening and Van 
Hamersveld, who believe surfers are in a unique position to appreciate that the 
waves and beaches constitute an endangered natural resource. They see their 
company as evidence that surfing is growing up, looking beyond the perfect wave 
for practical solutions to the pollution, overdevelopment and other complex 
problems that threaten the pastime they love. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're surfers, people aren't going to expect this from us," said 
Hening, 38, a former competitive surfer who wrote computer code for the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory and now does curriculum development for the Oxnard Union 
High School District. 
</P>
<P>
As founder of the Surfrider Foundation in 1984, Hening was one of the first to 
realize that the world's estimated 3 to 4 million surfers constitute more than 
a market for boards and sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, Hening said, he wanted to be proud, instead of embarrassed, to say 
that he was a surfer. Other surfers, too, he felt, needed an outlet for their 
mature, even educated concerns about the environment in which they play. Today 
the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation has 5,000 members and a full-time staff. The 
Huntington Beach-based foundation takes legal and other action to protect surf 
spots, water quality and coastal access. 
</P>
<P>
Hening has experienced surfing as an obsession -- in the 1970s, he lived on a 
beach in El Salvador, making and selling peanut butter to support his 
wave-riding habit. Van Hamersveld, too, invested large chunks of his youth in 
obsessively riding the waves off Palos Verdes Cove with board maker Phil Becker 
and others who would become surfing legends. 
</P>
<P>
A graphic designer, Van Hamersveld, 48, created one of the genuine icons of the 
surfing craze in 1964 -- the Day-Glo poster for Bruce Brown's movie "The 
Endless Summer" that is now in the permanent design collection of the Museum of 
Modern Art. Perhaps best known as the designer of album covers for the Beatles 
("Magical Mystery Tour"), the Rolling Stones and other rockers, he also created 
trademarks for the beach-influenced sportswear lines, GOTCHA and Jimmy'Z. 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between Geo Surf and the Surfrider Foundation, the men say, 
is that the new venture is a business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking a corporate approach," said Hening. 
</P>
<P>
The first venture of the new company, still in the process of being 
incorporated, will involve packaging and disseminating information, according 
to its founders. Its first "product" will be a Geo Surf symposium, to be held 
in July on the campus of Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium is designed to bring together all the major groups with a 
personal or commercial interest in the surf, Hening said. The conference, which 
its creators hope will become an annual event, will allow participants to 
"share and acquire new knowledge concerning the issues, the science and the 
magic of waves and beaches," according to a conference brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Hening said he hopes that the conference will allow for "the mature exchange of 
ideas" among all the groups that need the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying the lion will lie down with the lamb, but we're very 
interested in seeing professional surfers in the same room as real estate 
developers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Geo Surf is not categorically anti-development, according to Hening. He sees 
the company's willingness to give a hearing to all groups with an interest in 
the surf, including businesses, as evidence of its maturity and of his own. (He 
used to be appalled, he recalled, at any attempt to commercialize surfing, 
which he saw as essentially a spiritual activity.) 
</P>
<P>
Van Hamersveld has designed a red-and-blue logo for Geo Surf, which the men are 
registering as a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they plan to license the name and logo. Van Hamersveld said his 
experiences with "The Endless Summer," GOTCHA and Jimmy'Z have persuaded him of 
the commercial power of surf-related licensing. The Geo Surf imprint, for 
example, might appear on a TV project, a film or on more conventional products, 
such as sunscreen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other possibilities: Geo Surf might serve as a consultant to 
companies that want to tap into the surfer market. It may also market a 
computerized surf information service. 
</P>
<P>
The founders say that at least half of the profits from such ventures will be 
plowed back into pro-surfing projects, such as building artificial reefs or 
blocking development that would harm existing surf spots. Van Hamersveld said 
he especially likes the idea of raising money for good works through the sale 
of products that are beneficial and allow "consumers to support environmental 
causes in a direct way." 
</P>
<P>
One immediate goal of Geo Surf is a selfish one: to save the men's own surf 
spot, off Malibu's Surfrider Beach. Over the years, both men continued to be 
passionate surfers, despite occasionally being treated like old coots as they 
queue up to surf traffic-jammed Third Point. 
</P>
<P>
But two years ago, Van Hamersveld had to give up the sport because he began to 
have skin eruptions after surfing, caused, his physician advised him, by 
viruses in the water. Although he continues to surf, Hening, too, is appalled 
by the water quality off Surfrider, especially since it became his 4-year-old 
daughter's surf spot. 
</P>
<P>
Surfrider is especially unsavory whenever water from Malibu Lagoon, polluted by 
sewage and bird droppings, is flushed into the sea by acts of man or nature. 
This occurs after high tides, heavy rains or the intervention of a Department 
of Parks and Recreation bulldozer, which regularly cuts a channel between the 
lagoon and the ocean to keep Malibu Colony septic tanks from backing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Malibu: The Microcosm for the Future of Surfing" is prominently featured on 
the program of the upcoming Geo Surf convention. As a first small step toward 
improving Surfrider, the men believe the surf-using public should be informed 
of lagoon bacteria counts and bulldozer arrival times. "We've got a real 
personal stake in this," Hening said. But beyond that, he believes Malibu could 
serve as an attention-getting case study of how a troubled beach can be turned 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good place to set an example," he said.

SOCKERS CAN'T QUITE COVER FOR ABSENTEES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing without most of their offensive punch, the Sockers nonetheless almost 
defeated the St. Louis Storm Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Socker midfielder Waad Hirmez didn't make the trip because of a heel injury. 
Forward Zoran Karic flew back to San Diego Wednesday morning because of the 
death of his father-in-law. And forward Branko Segota was a late scratch 
because of a sore calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
That's 38 of the Sockers' 88 goals missing. And the Storm took advantage for a 
4-2 victory that left them a game ahead of the Sockers and 2 1/2 behind 
first-place Dallas in the Western Division of the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
St. Louis is 11-11, the Sockers 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Segota was the most puzzling. He warmed up with the team, was 
placed on the lineup card by Coach Ron Newman but then left the field after the 
start of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about Branko until the game started," Newman said. "I wish he 
would have let me known earlier that his calf was bothering him." 
</P>
<P>
Newman and the Sockers switched gears and played a more defensive-oriented game 
than usual. The tactic worked for more than half the game, giving them a 1-0 
lead, but the Storm broke through in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Storm forward Stan Terlecki picked up a ball at midfield, beat George Fernandez 
down the right side and fired under goalie Zoltan Toth to tie the score with 
nine minutes 50 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Storm defender Fernando Clavijo changed the tempo for good when he scored with 
4:48 left in the game. Clavijo picked up a loose ball just short of midfield 
and blasted a shot past Toth into the upper right corner from some 120 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you give up a goal at that stage of the game, it changes the tempo," 
said Socker defender Kevin Crow. "We played a defensive game for so long, and 
we broke down." 
</P>
<P>
Marcio Leite made it 3-1 with 3:42 left when he beat Toth with a shot between 
his legs. Crow had come on as the sixth attacker, and the Sockers were applying 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Wade cut the lead to 3-2 with 1:41 left on a rebound, but the Sockers 
missed several chances in the closing minutes. Claudio De Oliveira put the game 
out of reach with 59 seconds remaining when he beat Crow. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played very well for not having most of our people here," Newman 
said. "We tried to play more disciplined soccer, and it worked for a while. 
Some of the guys we had on the field were not match fit. It was (Damir) 
Haraminas' first full game." 
</P>
<P>
Toth had held the Storm scoreless for 115:12 this season until Terlecki scored. 
</P>
<P>
"Zoltan is a great goalie, and you have to get him early if you want to win," 
Clavijo said. "We had to win tonight. (The Sockers) knew exactly what they were 
doing even without their top players." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers struggled in the first quarter, but Toth kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Doran tested Toth early from the left corner, but Toth kicked the ball 
wide. The Storm kept up the pressure in the second quarter when Gus Mokalis 
blasted a shot and Toth punched it wide. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Castro finally got the Sockers' offense going with 11:05 left in the half. 
Off a re-start, Castro had the ball in the box, but goalie Slobo Ilijevski slid 
to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez then had a open net with Ilijevski down and out of the play, but 
Michael Collins blocked Fernandez's shot in the box. 
</P>
<P>
Castro tested Ilijevski again with 2:59 left in the half, but Ilijevski stopped 
him from point-blank range in the box. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers finally got the ball past Ilijevski late in the half. Ben Collins 
was left alone on the far left goal post, and Jacques Ladouceur hit him with a 
perfect pass. Collins tapped the ball into the open net with 1:20 to play.

ZUNGUL IS GOING QUIETLY; 
</P>
<P>
SOCKERS: HOBBLED 'LORD OF ALL INDOORS' HAS BEEN GIVEN LITTLE TO DO IN THE FINAL 
SEASON OF HIS STORIED CAREER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Zungul, man of a thousand goals but very few words, is facing a challenge 
that, for once, he won't be able to control with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, life for the veteran Sockers forward was pretty much one big 
Saturday night. He hung out with Al Pacino in New York City, opened a disco in 
his native Yugoslavia, rode limos, frequented the theater and once attended an 
Olivia Newton-John concert in lieu of playing in a New York Arrows game. 
</P>
<P>
These luxuries were available to him because of the magic he could create with 
his feet. It was during this time that Giorgio Chinaglia, a legendary outdoor 
player, referred to him as one of the top forwards in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul was paid well, and what a thing his goals were to watch. Black-and-white 
photographs on the wall or in old media guides don't begin to do them justice. 
They were better suited to a Norman Rockwell painting. 
</P>
<P>
But things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
At 35, Zungul is playing the final season of an indoor career that began in 
1978, but the artfulness of it all seems to have disappeared. He hasn't suited 
up for eight games. He has scored only two goals. His arthritic hips have 
eroded his mobility to the point that Socker President Ron Cady says: "I've 
seen X-rays of his hips, and how he still plays is a marvel beyond my wildest 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Because the team has healed from early season injuries, Socker Coach Ron Newman 
says he doesn't have a place for Zungul in the first two starting positions. 
Zungul and Newman had a meeting on the Dallas trip in December. Newman said 
Zungul told him he would prefer not to suit up if he wasn't among the top two. 
Zungul wasn't willing to be used as a utility player. Newman obliged. 
</P>
<P>
So now it appears Zungul is closer than ever to departing from the familiar 
world of the kicking industry. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? 
</P>
<P>
Anybody's guess is probably as good as Zungul's, and that could explain why he 
won't discuss about his thoughts, plans or feelings. 
</P>
<P>
There may be another reason. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really had to talk about himself," said Branko Segota, a teammate and 
close friend. "He was always the point leader, and he was a leader. So he 
didn't really have to say anything because he was always at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Way at the top. He has collected 764 goals in the Major Indoor Soccer League 
alone. Add to that 63 goals from the North American Soccer League and another 
250 when he played with the Hajduk Split, a professional team in Yugoslavia, 
and that gives him well over 1,000. Forget all the nifty goals he must have 
scored in street games as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
For his achievements, he has been dubbed "The Lord of All Indoors." And largely 
because of his storied reputation, the Sockers decided, after much deliberation 
between Newman and Cady, that it would be worth their while and their $25,000 
(the MISL minimum salary) to bring Zungul out of retirement last season when no 
other team wanted him. It proved to be smart. He scored 42 points in 37 
regular-season games, 17 in 14 playoff games and played a significant role in 
the Sockers' seventh championship. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the cast has changed. Gone are midfielders Paul Dougherty and 
Chris Chueden and defender Alan Willey, all of whom made the Sockers more 
defense-oriented last season. Newcomers Damir Haramina, Wes Wade and Jim 
Gabarra are all forwards, and they're forwards of the future. That leaves 
Zungul out. 
</P>
<P>
So there has been talk of a rift between Newman and Zungul, who have never been 
the best of buddies anyway. Newman has tried to figure out where to place 
Zungul. Because of their rocky relationship, Zungul was not and probably will 
not be considered for assistant coaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been pretty well stated that Steve and Ron don't go out to dinner 
every night," Cady said. "But I think they have mutual respect for each other." 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Newman insists he has nothing against Zungul.

"It's not a personal vendetta," he says. "I've never had a personal vendetta. 
I'm just purely trying to pick the best team for the job. I don't care where 
they are, who they are, what they've done. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve is a player who still has to work to get a spot. When everybody's fit, 
and all the forwards are fit, he's still got to fight for that position like 
anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
But we are talking about a legend. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not my problem," Newman says. "I can't play players on the strength of 
their clippings book." 
</P>
<P>
Segota still thinks Zungul has a clip or two left in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's been given a fair chance to play," Segota says. "If Steve 
was in there in key areas of the field sometimes, I think he can make things 
happen. He's still got the knack to score, and his passing is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Even Segota will admit, though, that the rest of the players need to work a 
little harder when Zungul is on, covering for him on defense. Certainly, Zungul 
is not in the shape he was several years ago, or even at the end of last 
season. And he has never had the reputation for tackling physical training with 
a great deal of zest. 
</P>
<P>
There is always the question of whether or not it was in Zungul's best 
interests to return this season. Ron Fowler, the Sockers' owner, said he and 
Cady decided that Zungul's contributions last season should be acknowledged. So 
they gave him a position on this year's team. There has been talk that Fowler 
brought Zungul back to make a big publicity splash by retiring him at the MISL 
All-Star game Feb. 22. To that, Fowler responds: "There's absolutely no truth 
to us trying to make a buck off Steve. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to bring him back. We felt, especially during the playoffs, he was a 
positive influence and a significant contributor." 
</P>
<P>
Newman's view is slightly different. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't guarantee him another championship," he says, "That was an ideal time 
for him to say thank you, well done and go out in glory, because he was very 
much an important part of the history of this league." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he, Zungul and Cady reached an agreement that if Zungul didn't feel 
a "burning desire" to play at any time during the season, he would alert them. 
Since then, Zungul has met several times with Fowler and Cady, expressing a 
displeasure at his lack of playing time. Fowler and Cady both say they will not 
interfere with Newman's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not going to dictate what his role was going to be," Fowler said. 
"That was up to the coach. I think he feels he should be playing, but Ron 
Newman is the coach of the team, and he is the only one who is going to decide 
who is going to play and who is not going to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve would like to have us step in. I've offered to have a meeting 
with the two Rons. Steve, at this stage, has chosen not to have the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Newman said he called Zungul and asked him to go on the trip to 
St. Louis, where the Sockers played Wednesday. Zungul told him he didn't think 
he was quite fit yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very pleasant, actually," Newman said. "I told him I didn't have a 
vendetta against him. I said 'Let's don't become enemies.' I want Steve to 
retire without damage to his reputation." 
</P>
<P>
It may take the remainder the season to fully determine if that is feasible. 
There are reasons Zungul may still figure into the Sockers' plans. Coincidence 
or not, the Sockers are 7-3 in games Zungul has played, 3-9 without him. Fowler 
said he is well aware of that statistic and has given Newman a specific date by 
which he wants to see the Sockers winning on a more regular basis. After that, 
there will be changes. Playing Zungul is one possibility. A trade is another. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries down the stretch might allow Zungul playing time, and it would be hard 
to argue that he isn't a bad guy to have around as playoffs draw near. 
</P>
<P>
"He can help," defender Kevin Crow said. "He's got the experience. If you're 
going to have a 17th or 18th man, who better than Steve? Especially during 
crunch time. He did it last year. He's able to lift it for short periods of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He might be able to do it one more time. But then, that will be it. This is 
definitely Zungul's last season as a player. He has said so. The Sockers have 
said so. After that, he will face a new world, one that hasn't always been kind 
to former soccer superstars. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood on the sideline during a Socker practice during preseason, Zungul 
was asked about Kaz Deyna, the former scoring wizard who was killed in an 
automobile crash this past summer. Friends of Deyna said he hadn't been the 
same since retiring. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit at the 
time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Zungul spoke of the importance of MISL organizations assisting players in 
making the segue from soccer to everyday life. This is not an easy transition 
for someone who is used to the applause, the autograph seekers, the trophies 
and the slaps on the back. You are suddenly someone who blends rather than 
someone who stirs. 
</P>
<P>
"Not dressed in jeans, dressed in a jacket," Zungul said. "An adult. Not an 
entertainer anymore. You are an ordinary man just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
That can be a little scary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very uncomfortable situation for Steve," Fowler says. "It's very 
uncomfortable for the team. That's life. No one said life would be fair."

NEVER ON A FRIDAY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS PROHIBIT VILLAGE CHRISTIAN'S BROWN FROM 
PLAYING ON SABBATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheerleaders nervously chew their fingernails and check make-up as the gym at 
Village Christian High fills on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the locker room, players lace high-tops in silence, then stretch, pregame 
nerves rattling. Crusader Coach Mike Henzie outlines last-minute instructions 
as the team awaits the conclusion of the junior varsity game. And John Brown, 
Village Christian's 6-foot-6 junior center, is praying. 
</P>
<P>
But not in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is with his family. 
</P>
<P>
In church. In La Crescenta, some 16 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who averages 23 points and 11 rebounds a game, is kneeling in church. 
The team's dominant post player has no intention of playing basketball on this 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Or any Friday night, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown, on Friday nights, has a higher object of concentration than the one 
that hangs 10 feet above the floor at both ends of a basketball court. John 
Brown is more than a talented basketball player with hopes of playing in 
college: He is a Seventh-Day Adventist. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many teen-agers have ambiguous feelings about religion, John 
Brown is a 17-year-old walking, talking and dribbling anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up to do what I thought was right," he says, "and I really think 
it's right that I keep this day holy for the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
"This day" spans from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. That is the Sabbath, a 
day that Adventists believe should be set aside to honor their God. 
</P>
<P>
As Brown's father, John, says: "We are reminded in the Ten Commandments that we 
are to keep that day holy for God . . . and we believe that the Ten 
Commandments are something that are eternal. And at the very heart of that is 
the Fourth Commandment, which says remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
</P>
<P>
"And to that end, we do not do any personal sports on that day, or anything 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Seventh-Day Adventist religion stems from a Christian evangelical movement 
that developed in the 19th Century as an outgrowth of a general spiritual 
awakening that swept the country. It was formally organized in Battle Creek, 
Mich., in 1863 and is distinguished by the observance of the Sabbath as a 
memorial of God's creation and by faith in the imminent, personal return of 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Adventist membership exceeds 2 million, according to Encyclopedia Americana, 
and supports nearly 450 colleges and secondary schools and nearly 4,000 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
But at nondenominational Village Christian in Sun Valley, the younger Brown's 
religious views are greeted with curiosity. Those views drew increased interest 
when the rest of the student body learned that Brown can, put plainly, fill it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is ranked seventh among Valley-area players in both rebounding (11.0) and 
scoring (23.1). But he can't -- and won't -- play basketball on Friday night. 
Village Christian plays six Alpha League games on Friday nights; the other six 
are scheduled as mid-week games. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long shot, however, that Brown even made the team. On arrival at 
Village Christian, he was advised by wary administrators that sports may not be 
an option for someone who would not play on what is the most active high school 
sports night of the week. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown has pushed through those fears. Now, it seems as if the team can 
barely get along without him. The Crusaders are 5-7 with Brown, 0-4 without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The players, of course, know it. But that doesn't stop teammates from teasing 
him, which is about as serious as the fallout gets. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we tease him about it," says point guard Matt Henzie, the coach's son. 
"We're at practice and we say, like, 'We're going to play great Friday night, 
right, John?' And then we go, 'Oh, yeah, that's right.' You know, put a little 
guilt on him." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Henzie is the man in the middle. He watches Brown in practice Monday 
through Thursday rain three-point shots, carve his way to the basket from the 
high post, and dribble coast-to-coast. 
</P>
<P>
And then he watches Brown fit his lanky body into his mother's car on Friday 
afternoons and drive off; the team's leading scorer and rebounder heads home to 
worship. Still, Henzie greets the situation with respect and humor. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure, we've got a decent team," he says with a smile, "when we're all 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders have seven games left, and Brown was scheduled to play in three 
of them. However, he contracted chicken pox this week, causing him to miss one 
more mid-week game. That leaves only two games for Brown, unless the Crusaders 
advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But there's always next season. And more Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the kids don't quite understand (Brown's religion) because it's a 
different doctrine than most Christians really hold to," Henzie says. "I don't 
think they're upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
The coach laughs. "I think they'd all like to see him change." 
</P>
<P>
There will, of course, be no changing, although the Browns recognize the 
dilemma. Their son loves basketball and it's difficult to explain to a boy 
hooked on hoops why he has to exchange the hardwood for the stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
John's parents even remember when he suggested an amendment to the rule about 
the Sabbath. Couldn't they cut the Sabbath short at noon on Saturday, he asked, 
so he could play in late afternoon games on the junior varsity? 
</P>
<P>
"My father pointed out to me, showed me the Bible, took time with me, where it 
said that from sunset Friday night to sunset Saturday night was the Sabbath. 
And that really satisfied me for what I believe," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
The situation evokes memories of Eric Liddell -- the Scottish sprinter featured 
in the Academy-Award winning film "Chariots of Fire." Liddell passed up a 
chance to win an Olympic medal at the Paris Games of 1924 because his race was 
scheduled for a Sunday, and as a devout Christian, he felt he should honor God 
on that day in lieu of seeking personal glory. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is the same with the Brown family. Only John wishes that the 
games were on Sundays. Then he could play ball. 
</P>
<P>
John would not have had to worry about playing competitive basketball had he 
stayed at Seventh-Day Adventist schools. But, for personal reasons, he 
transferred to Village Christian. 
</P>
<P>
There, administrators told John that he still need not worry about competition, 
because he would never play a varsity sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my religion and Friday night, they said I'd never be able to play a 
lot of the games," he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
There are some things, of course, that you don't tell teen-agers. If you tell a 
teen-ager that he or she cannot do something, consider it done. 
</P>
<P>
"Them telling me that I'd never make it on a varsity sport was just them 
setting my goals," he said. "They're telling me that I can't do this, so why 
not just go for it?" 
</P>
<P>
After a brief stint with baseball in the eighth grade, the rapidly growing 
freshman tried out for the freshman basketball team. At season's end, he was 
chosen most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
John's father recalls with pride the suddenly different reaction his son drew 
from coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"When John took off with the freshman team," his father says, "the JV coach 
said, 'Mmmmm, if I could have just had him on my team. If he'd have just played 
on Friday night.' " 
</P>
<P>
At season's end last year, he was chosen most valuable player of the junior 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Henzie sought Brown for the varsity. Sure, he was going to miss some 
games, but the times he would be there, it was becoming apparent, he would be 
an asset. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk one up for perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'See? God will work with you,' " his father says. "You don't have 
to give up your beliefs. Don't let other people set your goals for you." 
</P>
<P>
Now, rival coaches are the ones who can't believe it. They just hope they are 
fortunate enough to play Village Christian on a Friday night. Not that Brown is 
the entire team. But who would mind if the opposition had to replace its 6-6 
center? 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep Coach Howard Abrams was fortunate enough to catch Village 
Christian on a Friday night. His Mounties thumped the Crusaders, 87-40. But 
Abrams was aware of his good fortune. "We're just hoping there's not a solar 
eclipse that day," he deadpanned before the game. "Or a sun storm." 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist Coach Maury Neville wasn't so fortunate. His team met Village 
Christian on a Tuesday night and lost, 45-44. He believes that Brown is good 
enough to play in college -- but recognizes his limitations as well. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely can shoot," Neville said. "He could play forward at a Division 
III-type school. But it's gonna be tough if he can't play Friday nights." 
</P>
<P>
Brown understands, knowing his chances of playing in college hinge upon a coach 
willing to accept the Sabbath rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play basketball at a college," he says with a trace of awe. "That 
really sounds exciting." 
</P>
<P>
He knows there are obstacles. That's nothing new. He has known obstacles -- 
much more so than the average 17-year-old athlete. And, sure, there will be 
obstacles in the future. But for now, Brown can take heart in the fact that he 
has tackled his biggest goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to show them that I could play basketball," he said.

COLD SHOOTER CATCHES FIRE, EL CAMINO BEATS LONG BEACH, 77-69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
El Camino guard Larry Lockley was pretty inactive in the first half of 
Wednesday night's South Coast Conference game against Long Beach. But the 
6-foot-2 sophomore prevailed with six points in the remaining four minutes to 
secure the Warriors' 77-69 victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Jamal Ross contributed eight, six of them in the last two 
minutes, to improve El Camino's record to 17-6 and 2-2 in the South Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach went into the game as the only undefeated team in the five-member 
SCC. The Vikings fell to 12-11 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Long Beach was going to come at us harder in the second half," said 
El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "I was ready for their full-court press.' 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings didn't need to utilize it in the first half thanks to poor El 
Camino shooting and an array of unforced turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors fell behind in the opening minutes of the game. With 11:58 left in 
the half El Camino trailed by 10 after Long Beach's Michael Jackson hit an 
eight-foot jumper from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors came to within three, 22-25, after a Darius Dubose bank shot with 
6:45 left in the half. Back-to-back three-pointers by El Camino's Keishaun 
Darthard and David Keeter shaved the Vikings' lead to 28-30 with 3:54 remaining 
for the break. Long Beach had a 36-33 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino took its first lead two minutes into the second half when Steve 
Leary's tip-in put the Warriors up, 38-37. With 7:52 left to play, El Camino 
led by three after a seven-point run that included a Keeter three-pointer and 
pair of Lockley baskets. 
</P>
<P>
After Lockley's three buckets in the final minutes, El Camino was up 68-62. Two 
Ross baskets followed and the Warrior lead increased to 72-62 with 1:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino will play the Naval Training Academy in Saturday's non-conference 
game. The Warriors resume league action on Jan. 27 at Mt. San Antonio College.

EL SEGUNDO SURPRISES COACH IN TOUGH LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: COACH RICK SABOSKY DIDN'T THINK HIS EAGLES HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE 
WHEN THEY MOVED TO THE CAMINO REAL LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rick Sabosky learned that El Segundo High was moving to the Camino Real 
League in basketball, he did what any rational coach would. 
</P>
<P>
He considered resigning. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of a small public school playing St. Bernard, St. Monica, St. 
Anthony, Serra and Verbum Dei -- traditionally among Southern California's top 
basketball schools -- didn't strike him as particularly appealing. Or fair. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Sabosky didn't quit. But the idea probably crossed his mind 
after the Eagles were manhandled by St. Monica, 92-43, two weeks ago in their 
second Camino Real League game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going down the tubes fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was then. Today, Sabosky has a different outlook after El Segundo won 
three straight league games last week to pull into a tie for second place with 
St. Bernard and Verbum Dei at 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this actually has a silver lining to it," he said. "It's nice to say 
you'd have a better record (in another league), but obviously nobody cares what 
your record is if you don't do well in the playoffs. I think this is the right 
way to do it. I think the better competition makes the kids better." 
</P>
<P>
Sabosky's attitude changed considerably after El Segundo beat St. Anthony, 
79-76, last Friday, a victory that ranks as one of the most impressive in the 
school's history. 
</P>
<P>
Playing at St. Anthony's infamous "Pit," an antiquated gym where the fans are 
particularly hostile, the Eagles rallied from a 48-43 halftime deficit to hand 
the Saints their first league loss. St. Anthony and St. Monica are tied for 
first place with 4-1 marks. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a phenomenal win for us," Sabosky said. "The kids felt real good 
going in. St. Anthony makes a big deal about 'The Pit,' and I think our kids 
got a little fed up with it. Their fans are real rude. I think it got us as 
pumped up as it did them. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling on the team is that we enjoy going into these places and 
playing these teams. We know some of these teams have more talent than we do, 
but the kids know if we do the right things, we have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (9-8 overall) capped the week Saturday with a 78-52 win at home 
against Bosco Tech as senior guard Scott Panfil popped for 33 points and five 
three-point shots. This came after he had 24 points and three three-pointers 
against St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Eagles are a 2-A Division team competing in a league with six teams 
that are in higher divisions, they figure to earn a playoff berth even if they 
don't finish in the top three. This is because of a new power-rating system 
that awards points to teams for playing higher-division opponents and will be 
used to determine at-large playoff qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
If El Segundo does earn a postseason berth for the fifth consecutive year, 
Sabosky knows his players will be ready after facing the tough competition in 
the Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kids know we can compete against anyone because we've seen the 
best," he said. "Nobody is going to make us awe-struck after this." 
</P>
<P>
Sabosky says one of the reasons for El Segundo's early success in league play 
is a balanced lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles have an outstanding shooting guard in Panfil, a bruising center in 
6-foot-5, 230-pound Kenny Talanoa, an athletic forward in 6-3 Tate Seefried and 
two capable ball handlers in guards Tony Bartolucci and Craig Freisen. 
</P>
<P>
Panfil leads the team with a 21-point average, Seefried is second at 14.7 and 
Talanoa averages 12.8 points and 13.2 rebounds. Bartolucci and Freisen are the 
top assist men, averaging 5.8 and 4.7. 
</P>
<P>
Another plus, Sabosky said, is that all starters except Talanoa are shooting 
better than 75% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's victory at St. Anthony marked the second time in less than a year that 
El Segundo pulled a major upset in a hostile gym. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Eagles beat top-seeded Cabrillo High of Lompoc, 73-70, in the 
quarterfinals of the 2-AA playoffs at Lompoc High. 
</P>
<P>
"We're comparing (the St. Anthony win) to that game," Sabosky said. "It was the 
same kind of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
The road doesn't get any easier for El Segundo this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles resume league play Friday night at Serra, where the Cavaliers enjoy 
a distinct home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger basketball Coach Phil Sherman says it's too early to count Rolling 
Hills out of the Bay League race. The Titans, three-time defending league 
champions, started 0-4 before winning their first game Friday night against 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for Rolling Hills to get back into it," Sherman said. "I know how 
quickly things can turn around." 
</P>
<P>
That he does. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Leuzinger was in trouble after opening league play 0-4. But the 
Olympians came back to win seven consecutive games and tie Beverly Hills for 
fourth place, good enough to earn a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take seven or eight games to figure out who's tough and who's 
out of it," Sherman said. "I think the champion will have two or three losses." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger has gotten a boost this season from transfers Adrian McCovey and Ty 
Meriweather, a pair of 6-5 forwards. McCovey transferred from Fremont High in 
Los Angeles and Meriweather moved from Kokomo, Ind.

<P>
"They're basically guards," Sherman said. "They're both playing out of 
position. We don't have a power forward." 
</P>
<P>
Not in name, maybe, but Meriweather has filled the role nicely. He had 18 
points and 19 rebounds Friday in Leuzinger's 85-63 win over Torrance and has 
used his long, Kevin McHale-like arms to lead the team in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a pleasant surprise," Sherman said. "At one time I thought he wasn't 
going to make the team. He turned it around and started playing pretty well 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
"He's actually a three-point shooter, but we can't afford to use him in that 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's Bay League basketball game between rivals Palos Verdes and 
Rolling Hills will be televised at 3:30 p.m. Saturday by Dimension Cable, which 
serves the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment for the telecast at Rolling Hills is being donated by Mobile 
Television Productions of Torrance, whose president, Joe Heitzler, is the 
father of Rolling Hills guard Chad Heitzler.

PREP NOTES -- Perhaps the biggest basketball game of the week will take place 
Saturday night when much-improved Bishop Montgomery plays host to Mater Dei for 
first place in the Angelus League. Mater Dei is ranked third in the state among 
Division I schools by Cal-Hi Sports, while Bishop Montgomery is ranked ninth in 
Division II . . . Bragging rights on the beach will be at stake Friday night 
when Redondo plays host to rival Mira Costa in an Ocean League basketball game 
. . . Hawthorne's soccer team kept pace with Palos Verdes for first place in 
the Bay League by beating Leuzinger, 2-1, Tuesday. Jorge Aguinina scored both 
goals for the Cougars, who improved to 13-4-2 overall and 5-0-1 in league play.

THE OTHER SIDE OF PERFECTION; 
</P>
<P>
PALOS VERDES SOCCER TEAM FINDS IT TOUGH TO KEEP WINNING THEM ALL 
</P>

<P>
Even perfection has its downside. 
</P>
<P>
Basically all you can do after you've won everything is try to maintain it. And 
that hasn't been an easy task this season for the Palos Verdes High soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
In the kind of season usually left in the closets of one's imagination, Palos 
Verdes went 33-0 last year en route to the Southern Section 4-A Division 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
But there were lingering effects of the dream season that this year's team 
inherited, most notably a win streak that had the Sea Kings wanting. 
</P>
<P>
There also were positions to fill because of graduation or relocation, and even 
though it was not discussed openly, there was an underlying pressure to perform 
at the championship level. Which the Sea Kings did, for a while. 
</P>
<P>
They began this season by winning their first seven games. But then the 
inevitable happened. 
</P>
<P>
They lost. 
</P>
<P>
The odds eventually caught up with them. But before they were beaten, they had 
accomplished their goal by extending their victory streak to 40 games without a 
loss or a tie. The previous record without a loss or tie was believed to be 38 
games by San Gabriel High in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But according to records kept by soccer officials -- South Torrance boys Coach 
Roger Bryant and Simi Valley girls Coach Mark Johnson -- the record was 21 
victories set by San Gabriel over the 1970-71 and '71-72 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where we came up with the 38," Palos Verdes Coach Alan King said. 
"We never really looked it up. Someone said they saw it in the paper, so we 
went with it." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this season, the win streak was the Sea Kings' motivation. 
But after they were defeated by San Marcos, 1-0, in the semifinals of the South 
Torrance Tournament, they needed to find a new source of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had to rethink our game strategy and mental approach," said senior 
halfback Doug Kay. "Things ran smooth at the beginning of the season, then we 
started breaking down defensively and we were not being aggressive. We had no 
heart to play a whole game. 
</P>
<P>
"But now we're coming together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
And their play shows it. Palos Verdes is ranked No. 2 in the 4-A Division 
coaches poll and has won 10 of its last 13 games for a 17-2-2 record, 5-0-1 in 
the Bay League. Not perfect but perhaps the makings of a another championship 
team. The Sea Kings, who share first place with Hawthorne, resume league play 
at Rolling Hills at 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant believes this year's Palos Verdes team is just as dangerous as last 
year's. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody goes after them," he said. "They make everybody want to play 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kay, the team's leading scorer: "Last year we knew we were going all the 
way. We had a cocky team." 
</P>
<P>
They were so sure that they adopted "Coast-to-Coast" as their motto, meaning 
they would win every game. One of last year's seniors, Lance Haworth, the 4-A 
Player of the Year, even drew a map of the United States on the chalkboard in 
the journalism classroom to track their progress through the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was that brand of confidence that carried them to the title. 
</P>
<P>
"(The motto) was "Back-to-Back" this year," said Kay, "but it's kind of screwed 
up now. We don't have that cockiness and aggressiveness this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that at the beginning of the season anybody thought we could 
stand up to last season. But then when we won our first seven or eight games, 
we thought, 'Well maybe we do have a chance to keep this thing going.' 
Obviously we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our coach or fans harbored any delusions that we would (go 
undefeated again). We knew it would be a new team, and to go that far you need 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's team was deep in experience with 14 returning players. This season, 
the Sea Kings had only four players return, three of whom are starters: Kay, 
forward Pete Malishka, halfback Brandon De Mott and goalkeeper Mark Antrobius, 
who recorded his 10th shutout of the season Tuesday in a 5-0 win over Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, if you get one season (like last year) in a lifetime, you'd say 
you were very fortunate," King said. "It was a dream year as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Reality has the Sea Kings back to earth.0

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER ANTELOPE VALLEY FREE-THROW WHIZ TAKES VERBAL SHOT AT OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Chambers, coach of the San Jacinto College basketball team, protested what 
he claimed was poor officiating by pulling his team off the court in the final 
seconds of a game at Antelope Valley last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The referees let everything go," Chambers said. "(Antelope Valley) committed 
some flagrant fouls. They'd better wear shoulder pads when they come to Mt. San 
Jacinto." 
</P>
<P>
Sounded like a threat. And from an Antelope Valley alumnus no less. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers played basketball for Antelope Valley in 1962-63 and is a member of 
the school's Hall of Fame. Ironically, Chambers used to benefit from 
officiating that went Antelope Valley's way. He still holds the school record 
for consecutive free throws in a game (21). 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers' team does not toe the line with the same effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by seven points with 1 minute, 5 seconds left in regulation, Mt. San 
Jacinto made only one of six free throws, allowing Antelope Valley to tie the 
score, 95-95. The host Marauders went on to win in overtime, 115-107. 
</P>
<P>
Eight players fouled out in the game -- four from each side. 
</P>
<P>
Hot handed: The victory over Mt. San Jacinto was a painful one for Antelope 
Valley's Paul Ernst. The 6-foot-2 guard had been doubtful for the game after 
injuring his right (shooting) hand Jan. 10 against College of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
At first it was thought that Ernst had broken his navicular bone. The injury 
later was diagnosed as a severe bruise. 
</P>
<P>
According to Coach Newton Chelette, Ernst made the decision to play despite his 
injury. The Marauders needed him too. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst scored 20 points, including a 20-foot jump shot with less than a minute 
to play in regulation to spark the Antelope Valley comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Making the cut: At 6-foot-5 with a shock of red hair, assistant coach Rusty 
Smith is difficult to miss on the sidelines at Cal State Northridge basketball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He will stand out even more Friday when the Matadors play host to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Smith expects to be sporting a flat-top, courtesy of CSUN players who 
won a wager with the coach by defeating Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 90-78, on the 
road last week. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring that a little extra motivation could only improve the Matadors' 
chances in their California Collegiate Athletic Assn. opener, Smith cut a deal 
with the players, allowing them to alter his hairstyle if they styled on the 
Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"(Rusty's) definitely going to look different," Northridge freshman Bill 
Mazurie said with a chuckle Friday. "He lost the bet and now it's time to pay 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is 0 for 2 in wagers with Northridge players. Last year, the Matadors 
beat the Mustangs at San Luis Obispo, 72-63, after being hammered by Cal State 
Bakersfield, 86-59, the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Shaping up: After 13 games of inconsistency, the Northridge basketball team 
strung together two fine efforts at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Cal State 
Bakersfield to open CCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, 0-6 on the road before conference play, defeated highly regarded 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Bakersfield before vocal crowds of 1,977 and 2,002 
to start conference play and improve to 7-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our (nonconference) schedule may have helped us," Northridge Coach 
Pete Cassidy said after the Matadors had come from behind to beat Bakersfield, 
61-58. "We played four Division I teams on the road and I think, because of 
that, the guys felt more comfortable when they came into these two buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Sandy Brown, who scored seven points against Bakersfield, 
concurred with Cassidy. "We lost all four games, but we played the Division I 
teams pretty tough," Brown said. "We knew conference was a new season, and we 
came in ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
The increased intensity was evident in the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 42.2% from the field and 61.4% from the free-throw line in the 
first 13 games, Northridge improved to 54.1% and 72.5% in those categories 
against the Mustangs and Roadrunners. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors also improved in the turnover department, committing 12 against 
San Luis Obispo and nine against Bakersfield after averaging 16 in 
nonconference play. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Northridge guard Eugene Humphrey is doubtful for this week's 
games but probably will play next week against Cal Poly Pomona and UC 
Riverside, Cassidy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey started the Matadors' first nine games, but he has been sidelined 
since because of a severely bruised right thigh. He suffered the injury Dec. 30 
in the first half of a 71-65 loss at Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"(Eugene) is starting to jog again," Cassidy said. "But we don't anticipate him 
playing in this week's games. We don't want to bring him back too quickly and 
risk further injury." 
</P>
<P>
Pinned to the mat: Last April, shortly after accepting a job as assistant line 
coach for the Cal State Northridge football team, Scott Norton said: "Wrestling 
is over. It was what I did when I was skinny and could see my feet." 
</P>
<P>
But try as he might, Norton has found it tough to walk away. He has not trained 
in more than a year, but just as soon as his family's trucking business can be 
sold, Norton plans to resume training for the 1992 Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a decade since Norton was at his wrestling peak. In 1980, a short 
time after he won the heavyweight freestyle division in the U. S. Olympic 
Trials, then-President Jimmy Carter ordered a boycott of the Moscow Games. 
</P>
<P>
Norton narrowly missed making the U. S. team in the past two Olympic Trials. 
His last competition was in the 1988 trials in Boca Raton, Fla., where he 
finished third in the Greco-Roman class.

Lee Hamilton, voice of the Chargers on XTRA (690), announced on his nightly 
sports talk show Wednesday that he has agreed to a new two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, whose first three-year deal was ending, said he considered leaving 
about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The talks almost collapsed between John Lynch (XTRA's owner) and myself," 
Hamilton said. "I had about six different things going on. But the reason I 
stayed was because my heart didn't tell me it was time go." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton also announced that starting Monday, the beginning of his three-hour 
show will be moved up an hour, from 6 p.m. to 5 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a game matching equal talent, between two teams that were 
favorites to battle for the Harbor League boys' basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's game between Coronado and St. Augustine was instead a mismatch, 
and St. Augustine won, 74-61. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the best team in the league," Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said. "Our 
kids underestimated them, and they beat us up out there." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a loss to Christian last week, St. Augustine (1-1, 11-6) needed the 
victory to stay in the running for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a must-win situation for us," Coach Jeff Armstrong said. "You can't 
go down 0-2 in league and expect to win it. We talked about it all week. Now 
we're back in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the victory was assured with a 10-point lead and a minute 
remaining, St. Augustine's Bryan Cantwell and Paul Mossuto kept shooting and 
scoring until the final buzzer. Cantwell finished with season-high 31 points, 
14 in the fourth quarter. Mossuto scored 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to stay intense all the time," Cantwell said. "We had three intense 
practices this week. We came in thinking we were the underdog, and Wastila was 
the man." 
</P>
<P>
The Saint' defense held Derek Wastila, who has been averaging 18.7 points a 
game, to seven. 
</P>
<P>
After a sluggish first five minutes, St. Augustine trailed, 12-10. But the 
Saints then turned it into a running game and five minutes later had a 27-16 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create an up tempo and run against Coronado," Armstrong said. "We 
went up by 10, then wanted to play a deliberate game with high-percentage 
scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado (0-1, 10-7) trailed, 38-33, at halftime and never got closer than that 
in the second half. The Islanders had a number of opportunities, but missed 
shots from long range prevented them from challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't their press that hurt us," Stanton said. "Our kids were trying too 
many outside shots. When we came down the middle of court and got inside, we 
were scoring, but the kids just weren't doing it enough." 
</P>
<P>
James Stark led Coronado with 19 points, Adam Smith scored 17 and Paul Carter 
scored 11.

COX CABLE FIGHTING MAD AT CHANNEL 8;

<P>
TELEVISION: LEGAL ACTION CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF UNAUTHORIZED USAGE OF 
COONEY-FOREMAN TAPE.

Cox Cable is considering legal action against KFMB-TV (Channel 8) for using 
unauthorized videotape of the George Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight during its 11 
p.m. newscast Monday, according to Marty Youngman, Cox pay-per-view manager. 
</P>
<P>
Youngman said this was the first case he could recall of a San Diego network 
affiliate using videotape of a pay-per-view event without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Jim Holtzman, Channel 8 news director, nor sports director Ted Leitner 
returned phone calls Tuesday afternoon. Mike Reinberger, Channel 8's interim 
sports producer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10), KNSD-TV (Channel 39) and ESPN, the national sports network, 
used still photographs from the fight, won by Foreman with a second-round 
knockout. Channel 8 showed video of the fight highlights, including the final 
knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
In most events of this kind, cable systems throughout the country pay the fight 
promoter for the exclusive rights. Cox, acting as the San Diego Cable Sports 
Network, bought the rights for San Diego County from Top Rank Inc. and licensed 
other cable systems throughout the county to air it. Cox customers paid $20 per 
household to see the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Channel 8 is specifically prohibited by my contract" from using footage, 
according to Youngman. "It's something neither we nor Top Rank will put up 
with." 
</P>
<P>
When a bar or restaurant screens a fight without permission, it's not unusual 
for the cable system to seek monetary damages. Youngman said that is one option 
in what he said is a unique case. He wouldn't say what other options might be. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to know that if it is an exclusive program they can't turn to 
the 11 p.m. news for highlights," he said. "I'm more concerned with stopping it 
and making sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Youngman said someone from Channel 8 had called him on Monday to ask if fight 
footage could be used, but Wednesday he couldn't identify the caller. 
</P>
<P>
Youngman said Cox will investigate further before deciding on a course of 
action.

STUDY DOUBTS OAT BRAN'S CHOLESTEROL-CUTTING EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oat bran, much ballyhooed as a cholesterol-fighting food, appears to have 
little specific cholesterol-lowering effect in people with normal cholesterol 
levels, researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that large amounts of high-fiber oat bran are no more 
effective in a cholesterol-lowering diet than low-fiber refined wheat. This 
suggests that people's cholesterol levels are lowered not by any unique 
property of oat bran but simply because people eat less fatty food when they 
are full with carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a wide variety of starchy carbohydrates, ranging from cereals to 
rice, potatoes, bread, beans, pasta, fruits and vegetables, could be equally 
effective, the findings suggest. Previously, oat bran, because of its fiber 
content, was believed to have direct cholesterol-lowering properties. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing special about oat bran," said Dr. Frank Sacks, an assistant 
professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the leader of the 
research team. "It is like any other cereal product that does not have any 
cholesterol or saturated fat in it." 
</P>
<P>
Oat bran consumption has taken off in recent years after promising preliminary 
studies, heavy promotion by cereal manufacturers and a general public health 
emphasis on cholesterol reduction as a way to prevent heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Oat bran products have been the fastest-growing segment of the $6.5-billion 
cereal industry. In 1989 alone, 218 new oat bran products were launched, 
including cookies, cereals, pretzels and muffins. 
</P>
<P>
The new study is likely to dampen this enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial for the medical journal, Dr. William E. Connor of the Oregon 
Health Sciences University in Portland wrote: "Clearly, people who eat large 
quantities of oat bran or other similar cereals for breakfast have little room 
for bacon and eggs, and that may all be to the good." Connor called the 
research "superbly conducted." 
</P>
<P>
Sacks, Connor and other nutrition experts said that fundamental dietary 
changes, not magic bullets such as oat bran, remain the best way to control 
cholesterol. Such changes include reducing consumption of cholesterol and the 
saturated fats found in such foods as meat, pork and butter and replacing them 
with a variety of starchy carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, substantial interest in the potential cholesterol-lowering role 
of dietary fiber will continue. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dr. Larry P. Bell of the Hennepin County Medical Center in 
Minneapolis and other researchers have shown that psyllium, a fiber that is the 
active ingredient in several bulk-forming laxatives, appears to have 
cholesterol-lowering effects when taken in significant amounts -- two to three 
teaspoons a day. 
</P>
<P>
And after reviewing the new study, Bell and another nutrition expert, Dr. Edwin 
L. Bierman of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, noted 
that the study did not examine people with high cholesterol levels. These 
researchers believe that large amounts of oat bran may still have direct 
cholesterol-lowering effects in people with high cholesterol levels -- a 
possibility that Sacks and his colleagues said was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
But Bierman, who served as vice chairman of a National Research Council 
committee that issued a massive report in 1989 on diet and health, and other 
physicians not connected with the study also praised the Boston researchers for 
placing oat bran in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, director of cardiology at Johns Hopkins and the 
president of the American Heart Assn., said the message "before, during and 
after the oat bran craze is always the same: It is the whole diet (that 
determines cholesterol levels). It is the overall choices that you do and do 
not make." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rodman D. Starke, a heart association senior vice president, said the 
organization is "not convinced that there is satisfying scientific data 
supporting significant cholesterol reductions through oat bran-containing 
foods." 
</P>
<P>
The Boston study involved 20 healthy adults -- four men and 16 women -- who 
were dietitians or other hospital employees. The researchers said it was more 
carefully conducted and less prone to error than previous oat bran research 
that suggested a direct cholesterol-lowering effect. Many of these studies, 
they said, lacked appropriate control groups or the participants were told what 
diet supplements they were receiving, possibly influencing the results. 
</P>
<P>
While continuing on their usual diets, the participants ate diet supplements 
containing either 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of oat bran or low-fiber wheat for 
separate, six-week periods. This was the equivalent of five high-fiber oat bran 
muffins or five low-fiber refined wheat muffins a day. Their complete dietary 
intake, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and diet-related symptoms were 
closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid bias, neither the researchers nor the participants were told which 
supplement was prescribed when. All of the subjects took part in both the 
high-fiber and low-fiber phases to "minimize non-specific effects" and the 
effect of changes in the intake of foods other than oat bran and refined wheat. 
</P>
<P>
The cholesterol levels of participants "decreased significantly from base line 
during both the high-fiber and low-fiber dietary periods," according to the 
report. The average decrease was 7.5% during the oat bran period and 7.1% 
during the wheat period, indicating that the effects of the two food products 
were virtually identical. These changes mirrored decreases in the consumption 
of saturated fats and cholesterol, as subjects became full after consuming the 
additional oat bran or wheat. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that oat bran did not lower blood pressure, another 
of its reputed health benefits. The study was funded by the National Institutes 
of Health, unlike much dietary fiber research, which has been sponsored by 
cereal manufactures or pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the 20 subjects reported gastrointestinal side-effects while taking 
the oat bran supplements, such as excess gas, cramps and diarrhea. By 
comparison, only one subject experienced a gastrointestinal reaction -- 
constipation -- while taking the wheat supplements. 
</P>
<P>
This led the researchers to conclude that while people could "benefit from 
diets that are rich in oat bran if their dietary fat intake decreases to 
compensate for the calories of the oat bran . . . low-fiber products can 
achieve the same result with fewer gastrointestinal side-effects." 
</P>
<P>
Although people with high cholesterol levels were not studied, Sacks said there 
"is really no precedent" for a dietary factor or drug to be effective in such 
individuals if no significant reduction was seen in patients with normal 
cholesterol levels. But Sacks and other nutrition experts said it was important 
to study people with high cholesterol levels before this conclusion could be 
reached with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks also said there was "no question" that certain water-soluble fibers, such 
as fruit pectin, certain gums and "probably" psyllium, are effective 
cholesterol-lowering agents. But he cautioned that relatively large amounts of 
the fibers must to be taken, that products such as gums may not be palatable 
and that potential side-effects, such as the laxative effects of psyllium, need 
to be considered.

COLOMBIA'S DRUG LORDS CONCEDE THEY LOST WAR; 
</P>
<P>
COCAINE CARTELS: DECLARATION PROMISES AN END TO KILLINGS AND TRAFFICKING. VOWS 
RAISE HOPE AND QUESTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Warring drug lords conceded victory to the Colombian government Wednesday, 
announcing a suspension of their bloody campaign of bombings and killings. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration delivered with the release of a mother and daughter kidnaped 
last month, the traffickers also promised to free other hostages, suspend 
cocaine shipments and turn over their arms if they receive "constitutional and 
legal guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise declaration, which immediately raised both hopes for peace and 
skeptical questions, was signed "the Extraditables." That name is used by an 
anonymous group of traffickers believed to include kingpins of the so-called 
Medellin cartel, one of the richest and most brutal crime syndicates in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The drug lords have sued for peace in the past, offering to give up their 
multibillion-dollar cocaine trade in exchange for amnesty. But Wednesday's 
11-point declaration made no specific demands for amnesty and appeared to 
signal a unilateral and unconditional suspension of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
Point No. 10 of the document declared "that there will be no attacks with 
explosives in any part of the national territory and that we have ordered the 
suspension of any kind of executions of political leaders, organizational and 
governmental officials, judicial officials, journalists, policemen and military 
men." 
</P>
<P>
Point No. 11, however, said that the "essential cause" of the drug traffickers' 
fight "has been and will always be our families, our freedoms . . . and our 
rights of nationality." That point raised doubts about the ultimate surrender 
of the traffickers as long as the government insists on prosecuting them for 
crimes or permitting their extradition to the United States for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the traffickers recognize the right of the government to 
assure its own survival "in the face of organizations and persons who, as is 
our case, live outside the law, combatting institutions and the very existence 
of the established juridical order." 
</P>
<P>
It added: "Consequently, we accept the triumph of the state, of the 
institutions and the legitimately established government, though we will lay 
aside the arms and the goals of our struggle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the existing legal order with the hope of obtaining from the 
government and society respect for our rights and a re-integration of our 
families and communities." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the traffickers "have decided to suspend the shipment of 
drugs and to turn over the arms, explosives, laboratories, hostages, 
clandestine landing strips and other elements that form part of our activities 
as soon as we are given constitutional and legal guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
Minister of Government Carlos Lemos said accused traffickers will receive the 
same guarantees as all Colombians for a free and fair trial, but the government 
will not make "any kind of commitment" beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on television if the government would consider exempting traffickers from 
extradition, Lemos said: "The government has won this war on the basis of not 
making concessions. I don't see why it has to change policy, when its enemies 
themselves have declared that this policy has triumphed." 
</P>
<P>
Hernando Correa, Lemos' press spokesman, called the traffickers' declaration a 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be received with much satisfaction, but with much precaution, 
because in the past they have said many things that were not fulfilled," Correa 
said in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Security forces under President Virgilio Barco Vargas have sharply increased 
pressure on the cocaine trade during the past year, raiding numerous drug 
laboratories and other trafficking centers. In apparent retaliation last 
August, gunmen killed a judge, a police colonel and a popular politician who 
was running for president. 
</P>
<P>
Barco then signed emergency decrees that allow the confiscation of accused 
traffickers' properties and that override a legal impediment that had prevented 
extradition since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the decrees, the president declared war on the traffickers. In 
return, the Extraditables declared war on the government. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called on the Barco 
government to continue to resist the cartel's overtures. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always said, 'No deals,' " he said. ". . . President Barco has been 
clear on no deals, and so have we." 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government in recent months has seized scores of ranches, offices 
and homes, arresting hundreds of suspects. For their part, the Extraditables 
have terrorized the country with a campaign of bomb attacks. About 260 bombs 
have exploded since late August, killing more than 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic explosives planted aboard an airliner killed 107, and a bus bomb at the 
headquarters of Colombia's equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
killed 63. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, authorities hunted down kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, reputedly 
the No. 2 trafficker in the Medellin network, and killed him in a shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
Since Rodriguez Gacha's death, "narco-terrorists" have raised tensions further 
with a series of more than 20 kidnapings. Many of the victims have been 
prominent, including the son of President Barco's closest adviser, German 
Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
The son, Diego Montoya, was still being held Wednesday when kidnapers released 
Patricia Echevarria and her teen-age daughter, Lina. 
</P>
<P>
Echevarria is the wife of a prominent Medellin doctor and the sister of Barco's 
son-in-law. She and her daughter had been held in a rural house by hooded men 
since Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers released the pair Wednesday morning at a Medellin housing project 
that was financed by trafficker Pablo Escobar, the alleged leader of the 
Medellin network. News reporters, acting on a tip, found the victims inside a 
parked van. 
</P>
<P>
Echevarria delivered the declaration from the Extraditables, who said in the 
document that they were releasing the two hostages as proof of good faith. The 
hostages said other hostages would be released as circumstances permit. 
</P>
<P>
The Extraditables also offered to act as peace mediators for the government 
with groups of hired killers and paramilitary death squads. Officials say 
traffickers have helped finance and train many of the hired killers and death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration was written at least partly in response to a public letter 
signed by former Presidents Alfonso Lopez Michelsen and Julio Cesar Turbay 
Ayala and Archbishop Mario Revollo Bravo, the Roman Catholic primate here. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, published Tuesday, urged the Extraditables to release kidnap 
victims and suspend drug shipments. It said by doing so, the traffickers would 
merit "less rigorous treatment than if they persist in their criminal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
In their declaration Wednesday, the Extraditables called the proposal "a 
patriotic invitation." A controversy has broken out in the Colombian media over 
whether the letter's authors consulted with traffickers and government 
officials before making the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Lemos, the minister of government, declined to say Wednesday whether the 
government would offer "less rigorous treatment" to the traffickers. "Let's see 
first whether they turn themselves in or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Nelson Mejia, commander of the Colombian armed forces, said the 
traffickers' promises were "all magnificent, but the state makes no 
concessions." Sen. Ernesto Samper, a presidential hopeful in Barco's Liberal 
Party, said the traffickers do not seem to be demanding concessions in their 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an unconditional surrender that doesn't even leave room to talk 
about negotiations," Samper said. He added that the main question now is 
"whether, really, the offers they make are going to be carried out." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Colombian authorities Wednesday turned over an accused 
brother-and-sister team of cocaine traffickers to U.S. marshals in Bogota. The 
Colombian pair, Diana Maria Caballero Rangel Gamber, 29, and Roberto Caballero 
Rangel, 32, bring to 13 the number of Colombians extradited to the United 
States for drug charges since Barco's crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants fled to Colombia after being indicted in September, 1988, in 
Greensboro, N.C., with 11 others on charges of conspiring over a six-year 
period to possess and distribute cocaine.

1989 was the year George Orwell was proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Television, it has turned out, is not the ultimate tool of repression. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that Eastern Europe surged toward democracy, communications 
technology served the cause of liberation. The stories trickle in from country 
after country -- of Solidarity videotapes secretly screened in Polish church 
basements, of Cable News Network broadcasts picked up by satellite dishes in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Europe reshapes itself, the question is whether the opposite is true: 
</P>
<P>
Is technology actually democratizing? As the Eastern Bloc moves further toward 
economic modernization, does democracy become inevitable? 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate answer may be long in coming. The information revolution has 
barely begun in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, some believe Orwell's only mistake in his novel "1984" was 
thinking that television exercises control by inflicting pain. Maybe, as Aldous 
Huxley suggested, TV controls by inflicting pleasure -- a notion that might 
produce the advertising expert as political kingmaker and the pitchman as 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
But what is clear, and still largely unappreciated, is that the fall of the 
Iron Curtain was at least in part a revolution of technology. 
</P>
<P>
It was the need to modernize in the technological age that forged Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the first place. The act of 
modernizing then granted people access to the outside world that fueled their 
discontent -- and later helped their underground movements escape detection. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Gorbachev's challenge now is largely technological: How can he 
maintain political control while embracing technology that will decentralize 
information and undermine central authority? 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa asked the question differently: "Is it 
possible for a new Stalin to appear today who could murder people?" In an era 
of computers and satellite TV, he concluded, "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly technology is not the single cause of change in Eastern Europe. 
Events of such sweep require a confluence of factors, from the talents of 
Mikhail Gorbachev to the aging of the postwar generation that embraced 
communism, from mounting ethnic strife to -- perhaps most critically -- the 
growing economic gap with the West. 
</P>
<P>
But today economic opportunity goes hand in hand with technology. "These 
reforms are a result of civilization -- of computers, satellite TV (and other 
innovations) that present alternative solutions," Walesa told a recent luncheon 
gathering of journalists from the Washington Post and Newsweek. Gorbachev and 
he, Walesa said, "just happen to be people in the right time in the right 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
He is right that throughout the last decade, technology seemed the servant of 
revolution, not of repression. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first cases actually was in Iran. The Islamic revolutionary 
underground used audio cassettes to circulate the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
speeches throughout Iran, where one in four citizens was either working for or 
informing to the shah's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the use of technology for revolution spread to the very medium 
Orwell had seen as the ultimate tool of suppression -- television. 
</P>
<P>
Orwell feared the medium because it was centrally controlled, perfect for an 
authoritarian regime he called Big Brother. But in the 1980s the nature of the 
medium changed, at least in degrees, with the spread of satellite technology 
and videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irresistible Machines 
</P>
<P>
Videocassette recorders gave people some choice over what they could watch and 
allowed them to interact, even record their own images. So irresistible did the 
machines become to Eastern Europeans that they were allowed even in the most 
closed societies, such as Romania. In 1988, the Soviet daily newspaper Izvestia 
talked about "the currently fashionable passion for videotapes." 
</P>
<P>
The effect was distinctly political, even if people were mainly watching 
Western films on videotape. "Blue jeans and rock music and the message of 
possibility . . . the underlying message of being an individual," these were 
the subliminal political cues of the VCR, said Jessica Lipnack, whose 
consulting firm, the Networking Institute, studies the impact of technology on 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where the opposition was better organized, the VCR became a way of 
sustaining an underground, not merely fueling dissent. Solidarity kept itself 
alive from 1981 to 1988, among other means, by making video documentaries -- 
everything from biographies of Solidarity leaders to documentaries about 
demonstrations the official media tried to dismiss -- and screening them in 
secret in church basements and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
Another force undermining government control of television was satellite 
technology. Those who had satellite dishes -- some of them homemade -- could 
receive programming from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Channel 
</P>
<P>
One of the most watched channels was the U.S. Cable News Network, which CNN 
executive vice president Ed Turner said was received in government offices in 
several East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Even second-level and third-level managers and clerks can see another way of 
life," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
And when CNN correspondents arrived in such capitals as Bucharest, Sofia and 
Budapest, they were viewed as celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
The political impact of satellites was most profound in Hungary and Poland, 
where the manufacture and purchase of satellite dishes were legal. 
</P>
<P>
The effect, even if only the elite class had the dishes, was to force Polish 
and Hungarian official television to either become more open or become 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
When Poland instituted martial law in 1981, media-savvy Poles were already 
disgusted enough with official media that they moved their TV sets to face out 
of their windows as a silent protest. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the Polish media had changed so much that the government signed a 
contract to air a nightly half-hour newscast from CNN. Among other things, that 
program forced Polish television to dump its longtime anchor for someone more 
telegenic. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was what experts have taken to calling "spillover" viewing. 
</P>
<P>
People in East Berlin could watch West German TV. They watched Austrian TV in 
Hungary, Finnish TV in Soviet Estonia and the liberalized Polish TV all over, 
in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and parts of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The spillover viewing forced the "democratization of official Soviet TV," said 
Adrian Karatnycky, research director for the AFL-CIO, which was instrumental in 
supplying technology and funding to Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In Timisoara, Romania, ethnic Hungarians saw the liberalized Hungarian 
television and could watch news each night about the changes elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe. That was one reason, some think, that the Romanian revolution 
started in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
And so the media became the force behind the domino, as the Poles inspired the 
Hungarians, the Hungarians inspired the East Germans and the East Germans 
inspired the Czechoslovaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Poland could not be kept silent. Everybody saw it," said 
Gordon Schultz of the Walker Center, an ecumenical group working to support 
democratic change in China and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the power of the video and satellite underground was that, unlike 
Western radio broadcasts such as Radio Free Europe and the British Broadcasting 
Corp., it offered visual proof that made its message undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
And it was indigenous. It did not bear the stigma of originating with the 
American government. 
</P>
<P>
Less important in Eastern Europe were fax machines. But they played a major 
role in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker Center estimates that during the democracy movement last spring, 
there were 30,000 fax machines in China, many of them in private businesses, 
and 3 to 4 million phone lines in Beijing alone. Schultz said the fax machines 
provided a crucial way for reformers to communicate with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't think people in the rest of world know or care that you are 
giving up your life," Schultz said, "you are much less likely to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
And in some countries there were even computers. 
</P>
<P>
John Micgiel, assistant director of the Institute on East Central Europe at 
Columbia University, estimates there are now 1.5 million personal computers in 
Poland, probably the highest number in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Solidarity even tried to transmit lists of technical needs to the 
West on computers in secret code, according to Karatnycky of AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, technology aided the surge toward democracy by offering people 
"knowledge that there was a better life beyond their borders," said Richard 
Perle, a former assistant secretary of defense who is now at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Technology offered people hope by letting them know they had support in the 
West. It gave them the power to communicate, without detection by the 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch-22' Seen 
</P>
<P>
And on a deeper level, technology also proved to be a fundamental cause of the 
democratic movement. Laurien Alexandre, director of global studies at the 
Immaculate Heart College Center in Los Angeles, sees a "Catch-22" in the 
Eastern European Communist regimes' need for technology to compete economically 
with the West. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as you integrate these technologies into your economy and make them 
available to a larger range of people, you develop an information middle class 
who are not part of your leadership," Alexandre said. "And this stuff you can't 
control. You can't close down the fax machines because your economy will stop." 
</P>
<P>
S. Frederick Starr, the Soviet scholar who is president of Oberlin College, 
calls the result "technocratic glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
"Privatized information stimulates the formation of public opinion" and 
"induces individuation," Starr has written in an essay still unpublished. 
Subjects became citizens. Their world became more international. 
</P>
<P>
Technology, in other words, bred pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
And once the technology became decentralized, controlling it would have exacted 
a high price, economically and politically. As Wilson Dizard of the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies put it, "You don't pull out the phone 
system." Thus, Dizard said, "whether Gorbachev lasts or not, it will last." 
</P>
<P>
But if technology is not inherently suppressive, it is also not perfectly 
democratizing. 
</P>
<P>
If it were, logically television and computers would have improved democracy in 
America. Instead, they seem to have brought on an era of media consultants, 
negative campaigning and the science of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
Even apart from the American experience, not all technology is inherently 
democratizing. The fax machine, for instance, is actually no more secure from 
being monitored than any phone line, said Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring fax machines requires technology to record and then decode the fax 
transmissions. And in China, where technology is scarce, that was difficult. 
Still, about two weeks after massacring protesters in Tian An Men Square, the 
Chinese government managed to quash the fax underground by stationing a guard 
near most of the fax machines in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
More complex is television. While it was made more democratic and interactive 
by satellites and videocassettes and small cameras, it is still largely a 
centrally controlled medium. In most countries in the world, indeed, television 
is government-run. 
</P>
<P>
So some analysts say one factor that will determine the new face of Eastern 
Europe is which factions control the television stations, and whether they will 
allow open and pluralistic programming. 
</P>
<P>
"That fight is going on now," said Dizard, who has written extensively about 
the information revolution. 
</P>
<P>
And the outcome, he said, will be determined by internal politics more than by 
technology. The strong tradition of a healthy underground press in Poland, for 
instance, was one of the reasons that Solidarity was able to survive in secret, 
experts said. The same traditions are not nearly so strong in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
If any technology possesses intrinsically liberating qualities, those who study 
politics and communications believe it is the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Computers empower the individual, granting access to vast resources of 
information. "You can crunch a hundred pages onto a floppy disc, reproduce it 
cheaply and disseminate it to thousands," said Flamm of Brookings. "Compare 
that even to a Xerox machine." 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, there are not enough computers in Eastern Europe even to help 
modernize those countries' economies, let alone to dictate democratic social 
organization, those familiar with technology there report. 
</P>
<P>
And the other forms of communications technology are also in short supply. A 
month ago, Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO tried to fax some information to the 
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, only to find that "there are no fax machines in 
the Foreign Ministry in Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go," conceded Eric Chenoweth, who is studying the 
information revolution in the Eastern Bloc for the American Federation of 
Teachers and who believes that democracy is inevitable if technology advances 
quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does technology eliminate the other sources of authority. 
</P>
<P>
Even if communism can no longer demand total conformity, said Walter Raymond, 
assistant director of the U.S. Information Agency, "that doesn't mean you don't 
have a state power structure that keeps the troops in line." 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone is convinced of the microchip's democratizing qualities in the 
first place. Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO believes technology may have abetted 
reform in the 1980s simply because "these guys are much more clever and 
technology-oriented than the ossified elites they were confronting." 
</P>
<P>
Technology can still be used to maintain central control, he said. "Computers 
can be used to keep track of dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
Orwell's only mistake may have been in predicting the means by which television 
controlled the population, argued Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to 
Death," a scathing critique of the social impact of televison in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivial Culture 
</P>
<P>
"In Orwell's book," Postman said, "people are controlled by inflicting pain." 
The truth, he said, may be closer to Aldous Huxley's vision, in which people 
are controlled by inflicting pleasure. "Huxley argues that you can control 
people by making their culture essentially trivial," Postman said. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of the United States supports Postman's argument. As the power 
of the centralized political parties has waned, individual politicians have 
learned to use the media to practice a more subtle form of influence and 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Thus "spin control" could replace the old Communist technique of airbrushing 
people out of photographs -- a technique rendered obsolete by satellites and 
VCRs. Conducting sophisticated studies of survey research to better manipulate 
public opinion could replace the old-fashioned technique of registering 
typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that is the path Gorbachev seems to be following, scholars such as 
Dizard and Starr argue. Gorbachev's great insight, said Postman, is that "he 
understood at some level that it was no longer possible to have a closed 
society," thanks to forces in place long before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
That is one explanation of why he founded two major institutes, complete with 
25 regional centers, to study public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
They even measure Gorbachev's popularity rating now. 
</P>
<P>
But the tools of modern pluralistic politics do not guarantee success. Poland's 
leaders founded an institute to study public opinion in 1983 -- two years 
before Gorbachev came to power. Czechoslovakia and Hungary started public 
opinion institutes in 1988. Yet the governments of all three countries fell in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's "calculated gamble," said Dizard, is that Soviet leadership can 
move toward a pluralistic society "and still keep essential control." 
</P>
<P>
Dizard, for one, does not like the Soviet leaders' odds: "The long-term answer 
is they are not going to be able to."

WORRIED U.S. SENDS AIDE TO COUNSEL WITH AQUINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration dispatched Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M. 
Gates to Manila on Wednesday after U.S. officials privately concluded that 
President Corazon Aquino's position is so fragile that she may not be able to 
survive in office through this year. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters at a 
White House briefing that Gates' mission is "to convey to President Aquino 
President Bush's continuing strong commitment to democracy in the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
However, there were indications that Gates also has been given the job of 
warning Aquino of the need to make dramatic changes quickly. The sudden trip is 
reminiscent of those made in 1984 and 1985 by senior officials of the Reagan 
Administration, and by then-Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), in an effort to convey 
to President Ferdinand E. Marcos the high-level U.S. concern about events in 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a pessimistic U.S. evaluation of Aquino's prospects -- carried out 
in the wake of the nearly successful December coup attempt against her -- says 
that the young military officers who spearheaded the last two coup attempts in 
the Philippines still pose a major threat and could topple Aquino before the 
end of 1990. The group is known informally as the "Academy of '71," because 
many of the officers graduated from military academy that year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. analysis predicted that democratic government in the Philippines could 
give way to some form of authoritarian regime, along the lines of the one 
headed by Marcos. Salvador H. Laurel, Aquino's estranged vice president, could 
help provide the basis for such a regime, U.S. officials concluded. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. source familiar with the evaluation was critical of Aquino's 
leadership style. "Her tendency is not to engage either in confrontation or, 
unfortunately, in decisions," this official said. "She procrastinates on key 
issues." The source noted that there has been a narrowing of the group of 
advisers surrounding Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials also are concerned that the New People's Army, the Philippine 
insurgent movement, seems to be taking advantage of divisions between Aquino 
and the Philippine armed forces. The NPA is said to be targeting more Americans 
and other high-profile personnel for assassinations because a terror campaign 
would dramatize Aquino's vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, during the early hours of the attempted coup against Aquino, 
President Bush authorized American F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers from Clark Air 
Base to pin rebel planes on the ground. Aquino had requested the help, and she 
also sought unsuccessfully to have U.S. planes bomb and strafe military targets 
in and around Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted coup came just as the United States and the Philippines were 
scheduled to begin negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and the Subic 
Bay Naval Base, two of the largest and most important American military 
facilities outside the United States. The talks were quickly postponed and are 
now scheduled to open in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, the Philippine ambassador to the 
United States, Emmanuel Pelaez, said: "That there is a possibility of another 
attempted coup cannot be denied. But I don't think it can succeed. The 
circumstances of the last coup are no longer there." 
</P>
<P>
Pelaez said the December coup was fueled by the death of Marcos last September, 
the sudden return to the Philippines of Marcos' wealthy friend, Eduardo 
Cojuangco and joint exercises between American and Philippine marines, which 
gave some Philippine marines special access to new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Fitzwater said that the future of the U.S. military bases 
in the Philippines is not on the agenda for Gates' trip. 
</P>
<P>
"This is on more general areas -- her programs for rebuilding the economy and 
restructuring the government," he said, adding that the mission had been "in 
the planning for some time." Asked whether Gates would offer a "strong 
commitment" to the Aquino government, Fitzwater responded: "Absolutely, 
absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the stability of the Aquino regime, Fitzwater said: "Well, we, of 
course, very strongly support the Aquino regime. At the time of the coup 
attempt, you'll recall our efforts on behalf of her government. This trip is to 
make sure there is no question about that. There, of course, are continuing 
reports of problems in terms of security forces, and so forth. She is taking 
measures to deal with those, to prevent future coups, and we simply want to 
consult with her on those efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater made it clear that Aquino could expect continued U.S. military 
support in the event of another coup attempt. Responding to a question about 
whether Gates would pledge greater U.S. support in such a case, he said he 
could not speculate on specific actions, "but he certainly will be pledging our 
support and our continued policy support, and you know how we have responded in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
Gates is scheduled to meet with Aquino today and leave Manila on Friday, 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush initiated the trip and that Aquino had not requested the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
Gates led the committee of senior national security deputies in Washington 
during the coup attempt in December, when Bush flew to Malta to meet with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

HOW COLD WAS IT? IF YOU SAY PLENTY, YOU'RE WARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Roofs were leaking. Homeless shelters were jammed to capacity. Firewood sales 
were up, ice cream sales were down. Drivers on bald tires were finally shelling 
out for new ones. The flu bug and the ski bug were out in force. 
</P>
<P>
All over Los Angeles, the signs of winter were apparent on Wednesday, as 
jarring, in their way, as a four-lane road closure. 
</P>
<P>
The cold, rainy weather -- with temperatures dropping into the 40s -- was 
playing havoc with car washes and swap meets. Sidewalk cafes were closed. To 
gardeners, traffic officers and postal carriers, the conditions were a seasonal 
annoyance. For others, like Ed Marshall, who has endured six winters without a 
home, the raw breath of winter was something to be met with grim resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"It just means more walking to stay warm," Marshall, 33, said as he leaned 
against a wall of the Union Rescue Mission downtown, where the low sun slanted 
through gray, threatening skies. "In the winter is the best time to go to jail. 
You don't have to sleep in the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row, where dilapidated hotels offer temporary shelter for the homeless, 
was a particularly busy place as the county activated its cold-weather 
emergency plan for the first time this year. Under the plan, which takes effect 
whenever temperatures drop below 50 degrees and it rains, seven National Guard 
armories are opened to hundreds of homeless men, women and families. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the down-and-out residents of Skid Row and its various shelters were 
scrambling to find ways to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
Las Familias del Pueblo, an organization that runs eight Skid Row hotels, was 
calling out city inspectors to turn on the heat and hurriedly distributing 
blankets and moral support. As always, coffee pots in the organization's office 
were a ready barometer of discomfort on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Our coffee pots have been empty," director Alice Callaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold was driving Los Angeles residents of all kinds indoors. Many found 
</P>
<P>
their comfort at indoor matinee theaters, where it didn't take a Tom Cruise to 
draw a crowd. The drive-through trade at A-1 Santa Monica Fuel Co., a firewood 
outlet, was something any burger chain would envy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really jammed up right now," said company owner Pat Corner. "The weather 
makes or breaks us. Naturally, today is very good." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, more than 150 customers had come through, snapping up oak, 
eucalyptus and walnut that sells for up to $335 a cord. Corner figured to move 
six or seven cords before the day was out. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism was down. Travel, to a large extent, was toward the mountains. At 
Craig's Snow Job, a ski shop on Pico Boulevard, 150 sets of ski equipment were 
rapidly being reserved for the weekend. About half were already rented. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 'snow dances' have finally paid off," owner David Michels said. "We've had 
a steady flow of customers since we opened at 10 this morning. I came in early, 
8:30, and the phone was definitely ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
Surfers were among those rare people who considered themselves unaffected by 
the weather. If anything, the cold and the rain meant bigger waves, and so 
surfers were out at places such as Palos Verdes Cove and Haggerty's, a surfing 
spot not far from there. 
</P>
<P>
A steady crowd trickled through Becker Surfboards in Hermosa Beach. Manager 
John Leininger said the 4-to-5-foot swells were enough to have some surfers 
pricing new boards suited to larger waves. 
</P>
<P>
"If the water gets cold and the air gets cold, people buy more wet suits," he 
added. "It doesn't slow the hard-core guys from participating in the sport." 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Zoo, the bears were treated like -- well, like bears. They 
are dressed for any weather. But the bird shows were canceled. The apes and 
monkeys were kept in their barns. Like humans, the primates are susceptible to 
colds, spokesman Lora LaMarca said.

DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH SEIZED AFTER 31 YEARS AS FUGITIVE

A fugitive who escaped from custody 31 years ago while serving a sentence for 
killing six people -- three of them children -- in a spectacular four-car 
pileup on a Los Angeles freeway was arrested Wednesday after he arrived at 
Ontario International Airport aboard a flight from Florida, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Leonard de Casaus, 67, of Mexicali, Mexico, was taken into custody 
shortly after midnight, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. He had been 
sought since January, 1959, when he walked away from the Malibu sheriff's 
station, where he was an inmate trustee. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, De Casaus was convicted of six counts of manslaughter and drunk 
driving resulting from a crash on the San Bernardino Freeway in September, 
1955, that killed a couple, their three children and another man. A second 
couple and their two small children were hospitalized with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
De Casaus was serving six consecutive one-year sentences when he escaped, and 
deputies said they believe he fled to Mexico where he managed his family's 
wholesale grocery business. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, he worked in a grocery warehouse his family owned 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said several efforts to have De Casaus returned to this country 
were unsuccessful. Mexico has no extradition treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities learned, however, that De Casaus traveled on occasion to Florida, 
where he also ran a grocery warehouse, traveling on a passport bearing his own 
name. Deputies said they received information recently that De Casaus would 
arrive at Ontario, where he was arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1955 crash, De Casaus' speeding car jumped the freeway's center divider 
and smashed into oncoming traffic. The crash, a half-mile east of Eastern 
Avenue, left wreckage and bodies scattered over 100 yards, and gasoline from a 
ruptured tank sent a curtain of flame down the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Supermarket manager Joseph Golden, 54, of Duarte, his wife Minnie, 39, and 
their children, Barry, 12, Robert, 7, and Linda, 4, were killed. They were 
returning home from a family dinner in observance of Yom Kippur, the end of the 
Jewish high holy days. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth victim, William L. Spackler, 24, of Los Angeles, was in a separate 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 years since the accident have not dimmed the anger of Esther Wilkins, 
75, of Temple City, Minnie Golden's sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost five people -- just like the snap of a finger," she said Wednesday. 
"I'm happy they've got him now. If he pays for it, then that will be a little 
gratification." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said the news of De Casaus' arrest "brought tears to all of us. the 
accident is a family heartache. It's something that you just don't forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it was a case of getting away with murder. He didn't get what he 
deserved. The man was drunk. They gave him a year for each person he killed. 
They put him in a place where it was easy to walk out." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins' husband, Leon, 73, said he immediately recognized De Casaus' name when 
he heard the news on his car radio. The couple said surviving family members 
had been tearfully recalling the accident for much of the day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me years to get over it," Leon Wilkins said. "In fact, I don't think 
I'm over it yet." 
</P>
<P>
De Casaus' careening car also crashed into one driven by David B. Hearn, then 
23. Hearn, his wife, Nell, 22, and their two small children were hospitalized 
with injuries ranging from broken bones to cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"We had put the whole thing out of our minds," Hearn, 58, said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his home in Portola Valley in San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
He and his family moved from Van Nuys less than a year after the accident, and 
he said he did not know that De Casaus was a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
A computer programmer with IBM, Hearn said the accident "kind of changed our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement from the accident gave me an opportunity to go to college. I 
went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and sort of cut our ties with Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his hospital bed a day after the 1955 crash that made Page 1 
news for several days, Hearn said he could recall nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't remember anything about the accident," he said Wednesday. "The 
kids didn't really know it all happened. They know about it, but it's not 
family lore." 
</P>
<P>
Hearn's daughter, Deborah, not quite 2 at the time of the accident, now lives 
in Eugene, Ore., he said, and his son, David Jr., 6 weeks old at the time, is 
now a construction supervisor in Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
When the accident occurred, it was called the worst in the history of Los 
Angeles freeways. The next day, De Casaus said from his hospital bed that he 
would "gladly change places" with any of the six victims. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said De Casaus' car was traveling at more than 70 m.p.h. California 
Highway Patrol investigators said his blood alcohol level was much higher than 
the legal minimum to show intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
De Casaus is being held at the Men's Central County Jail, where he immediately 
began serving the five years left on his sentence. Escape charges are pending, 
deputies said Wednesday.

CRANSTON GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE SENATOR CHANGES HIS TACTICS AND ATTACKS HIS CHIEF ACCUSER IN THE 
LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Protesting his innocence and proclaiming his good intentions have not succeeded 
in clearing his name. And neither has lying low, waiting for the storm clouds 
of scandal to blow over. So reelection-minded U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston changed 
his tactics Wednesday and hurled a fuming broadside against his prime tormentor 
-- former federal bank board chief Edwin J. Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"A publicity-hungry political hack . . . Gray lies . . . lies over and over in 
the Hitlerian technique of the Big Lie," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the opening, and certainly the most lively, move in yet another 
attempt by the beleaguered Cranston to save his political future from the angry 
backlash over Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said that as his new political offensive develops in the days ahead, 
he will offer something to try to help those 23,000 or so Californians who lost 
their savings when they bought uninsured bonds at Lincoln branches. Details 
will come soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His goal is to redefine just what the fuss is all about with Lincoln, its 
chairman, Charles Keating, and California's senior senator in America's most 
expensive -- $2 billion -- S&amp;L failure. 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame me, Cranston said at his Wednesday press conferences in Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Blame Ed Gray, the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray was the man in charge when savings and loan institutions throughout the 
nation were heading into disaster, and he shares responsibility for a scandal 
that will probably cost taxpayers upward of $250 billion," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
So far in the long-running debate over his role in Lincoln's crash, Cranston 
and four other U.S. senators have shouldered plenty of the blame. The five 
accepted Keating's generous political contributions and then went to federal 
regulators on Keating's behalf in the midst of a federal investigation of 
Lincoln. Cranston accepted more than any of them -- $850,000 in contributions 
for three voter registration groups and $47,000 in direct contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The rub comes in what Cranston and the other senators did when they intervened 
for Keating at a pair of meetings in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has repeatedly said he did nothing more than prod the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board under Gray to speed up a long-running audit of Lincoln. This is 
the kind of help he gives constituents and California businesses regardless of 
whether they are contributors, Cranston insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, however, charged that Cranston and the other senators joined in 
pressuring him to withdraw a regulation restricting how much an S&amp;L could 
invest in things like junk bonds and real estate developments rather than home 
mortgages. The regulation was opposed by Keating. And instead of a routine 
inquiry by senators on behalf of constituents, Gray has called the episode 
tense and awkward and altogether extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee is now reviewing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Politics-minded Californians are keenly aware, though, that Cranston's helping 
hand for Keating has grown into a larger and stickier image problem for the 
venerable senator, long the champion of the "little guy." Now, he stands 
accused of having helped a "big guy," a big contributor, in a sequence of 
events that ended up costing many ordinary Californians their savings and their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston bored in Wednesday on the narrower issues of how he disagreed with 
Gray's version of their encounters and select events, casting the matter as a 
debate between two politicians -- a test of credibility between Cranston and 
Gray, a Democrat vs. a Republican, a senator against a former press aide to 
Ronald Reagan. In short, an old-fashioned political spat. 
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is basically premised on the falsehoods of one Ed Gray. 
When it becomes clear that he is not a man to be relied upon in word or in 
deed, I expect that the charges against myself, (and Sens.) John Glenn, John 
McCain, Dennis DeConcini and Don Riegle will be looked upon in a very different 
light," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gray is a public relations expert by profession. He knows he can tell just 
about any kind of lie about a politician these days and be believed -- 
especially if he repeats those lies over and over in the Hitlerian technique of 
the Big Lie." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who is now a Florida savings and loan executive, was on vacation, 
reportedly out of the country, and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In his broadside, Cranston blamed Gray for six "lies" that have misshapen 
public perceptions about the events. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said it is a "lie" that he pressured Gray. Gray has said he felt 
pressured. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said it is a "lie" that meeting with senators was anything but 
routine. "Gray preverts that meeting, making it sound like a sinister cabal," 
said Cranston. Indeed, Gray does. "I felt a tenseness in the air, an 
awkwardness that was overwhelming. Just me and five senators in a room. Nobody 
else to record what was said," he has said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said it is a "lie" that his intervention delayed federal regulators in 
acting. Among those who have made this suggestion is House Banking Committee 
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said it was a "lie" when Gray allegedly told an interviewer that the 
$850,000 in Keating contributions were to help Cranston get reelected. 
Actually, the contributions were for voter registration drives during the 1988 
presidential race, not Cranston's 1986 reelection. Gray reportedly described 
the voter registration groups as "phony," which Cranston said was another 
"lie." 
</P>
<P>
The senator plans to spend this week and next trying to regain the offensive 
and to discourage a growing number of fellow Democrats who are stepping all 
over each other -- half a dozen or more of them -- to test the idea of running 
against him in the 1992 senate primary. Cranston accused them of 
"ghoulishness." 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to his plan apparently is to offer help of some sort for those 
Californians who bought bonds at Lincoln branches. Many of the buyers now say 
they believed the bonds were backed by government deposit insurance. They were 
not, and are now without value. 
</P>
<P>
"When the facts get known to them, and when it becomes apparent to the bond 
holders what I have sought to do, and am seeking to do, and am about to do more 
for them than any other single person, expect perhaps the attorneys 
representing them, I think their attitudes will change," Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Polls in the state show a profound plunge in Cranston's popularity ever since 
his role in Lincoln was disclosed. But he gave no quarter Wednesday, after two 
weeks on vacation to brood over it. 
</P>
<P>
"I come before you bloodied but unbowed," he declared. "I assure you I have 
just begun to fight." 
</P>
<P>
And then the 75-year-old Cranston told a fable. It was about three elderly 
gentlemen who were talking about where they would like to be buried. One wanted 
to be buried next to Cleopatra. Another said he wanted to be buried next to 
Marilyn Monroe. The third said he wanted a plot beside Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
" 'But wait a minute,' the others shouted. 'She's not dead yet,' " Cranston 
continued. " 'Neither am I, the third one said.' "

WITHDRAW LICENSE OF CREATION SCIENCE SCHOOL, PANEL URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TROMBLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
A State Board of Education evaluation team has recommended that state approval 
be removed from a school in San Diego County that is the only creation science 
school in the country offering master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The team's report recommends stripping the mantle of state legitimacy from the 
Institute for Creation Research in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
The report "seems reasonable to me," State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig said, although he will not act on the recommendation for a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of the state license might mean the end for the institute, which has 
provided some of the intellectual underpinning for the argument that God, not 
scientific forces, created the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
John Morris, administrative vice president of the institute, said the report 
was part of "a very insidious plot" on Honig's part to "establish a state 
religion in California" that would be "anti-creationist" in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said he had received no word of the evaluation team's report but added, 
"obviously we'll appeal if the ruling goes against us." 
</P>
<P>
The institute has been authorized to grant master's degrees in biology, 
geology, physics and science education since 1981 but has awarded only about 20 
degrees in that time, Morris added. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year Honig has been trying to drop state approval because he 
thinks the school teaches religion, not science. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation report, written by a team of five college and university 
scientists who visited the institute for several days last August, touches only 
lightly on this controversy but does find that the institute's offerings are 
not comparable with other higher education institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The institute curriculum "is not consistent in quality with curricula offered 
by appropriate established accredited institutions," the report says, and its 
courses "are not comparable to the courses required of graduates" of accredited 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The report says the faculty has produced little reputable research, the library 
and laboratories are inadequate and the courses do not prepare students to be 
science teachers, which is one of the institute's main goals. 
</P>
<P>
Although the evaluators generally sidestepped the creationism issue, they did 
mention some of the problems involved in trying to do creation science 
research. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the report said that the institute's attempt to prove that the 
Earth's geological state was caused primarily by the flood of Noah described in 
the biblical book of Genesis fails to address these questions: "Where did all 
the water of the flood come from? How did it come down? Where did the water 
eventually go after the flood?" 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the negative findings, and the recommendation that state approval be 
lifted, were unanimous on the part of the five-member team, which included two 
science faculty members from UCLA, one from UC San Diego, one from California 
State University, Long Beach, and one from Cedarville College, in Cedarville, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But the report states that Leroy E. Eimers, professor of physics and 
mathematics at Cedarville College, disagreed with some of the findings and 
recommended that state approval be continued for the master's degree programs 
in geology, physics and science education but not in biology. Eimers was named 
to the evaluation group at the suggestion of the Institute for Creation 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
This is Honig's second encounter with the forces of creation science in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
In November, after a dispute that lasted several months, the State Board of 
Education adopted curriculum guidelines for science textbooks that stress the 
teaching of evolution as theory but delete references to evolution as 
scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation team's recommendations next go to the Council for Private 
Postsecondary Educational Institutions, an 18-member body that will meet in 
late February and will recommend that Honig accept or reject the report. If 
Honig agrees with the recommendations, state certification will be revoked.

JUDGE ORDERS NORIEGA TRIAL TO BEGIN WEEK OF MARCH 5 
</P>

<P>
In a surprise move, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler on Wednesday 
ordered the drug-trafficking and money-laundering trial of deposed Panamanian 
dictator Manuel A. Noriega and a raft of co-defendants to begin the week of 
March 5, but he left open the possibility of postponements. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler fixed the trial date after attorneys for Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, one 
of Noriega's co-defendants, invoked the federal "speedy trial" statute that 
requires court proceedings to begin within 70 days of arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken following a two-day bail hearing in which much of the 
government's case against Del Cid, the former commander of Panamanian military 
forces in the province of Chiriqui, near the Costa Rican border, seemed 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to go to trial quickly, and you are entitled to go to trial quickly," 
Hoeveler told Del Cid's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's lawyer, Frank Rubino, who was in the courtroom at the time, later 
told reporters: "I'm as shocked as you are. . . . I told the judge I'd be ready 
(for the trial) in nine months or a year." 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler indicated that he probably would postpone the trial if asked to do so 
by Noriega or any of the other defendants. But he noted that Del Cid could be 
tried separately. Del Cid previously asked to be tried alone, but Hoeveler has 
not yet ruled on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Cid bail hearing provided the first courtroom test of the case against 
one of Noriega's associates. Hoeveler agreed to give Noriega's lawyers, Samuel 
I. Burstyn and Kenneth Swartz, 10 days to respond to assertions made late 
Wednesday by federal prosecutor Myles Malman. He will not announce his decision 
on bail for Del Cid until he hears the response. 
</P>
<P>
Under the relaxed rules that apply to bail hearings, attorneys for both sides 
outlined for the judge the evidence they could present without being required 
to prove their assertions. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, significant factual portions of the prosecution case seemed shaky 
during the hearing. Although indictments against Noriega, Del Cid and the other 
co-defendants were returned almost two years ago, the government seemed 
uncertain of the facts it hopes to prove. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 2 hearing, Malman had said the U.S. government was prepared to show 
that Del Cid was former chief of intelligence for Noriega's Panama Defense 
Forces. On Wednesday, though, Malman conceded that Del Cid had never held the 
intelligence post. 
</P>
<P>
"When I said Del Cid was head of (intelligence), I misspoke, but I misspoke in 
favor of the defendant and not the government," Malman said, contending that 
Del Cid was more powerful than the intelligence chief. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the hearing, Malman said the intelligence post was held by Luis A. 
Cordoba, and that "Cordoba and Del Cid were close." Burstyn, however, said the 
friend of Cordoba actually was a Mario del Cid, not his client. Malman did not 
contest the assertion. 
</P>
<P>
At the Jan. 2 hearing, Malman also had asserted that Del Cid surrendered his 
troops in Chiriqui province to invading U.S. forces only after military defeat 
was inevitable and after Noriega had also given up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Swartz said Wednesday that Del Cid had telephoned the U.S. Southern Command 
early in the invasion with an offer to surrender to avoid needless bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"The surrender was not done at gunpoint; it was done over long-distance 
telephone," Swartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Malman acknowledged that Del Cid offered to surrender Dec. 22, before 
Noriega sought refuge in the Vatican embassy and at a time when there were no 
U.S. troops in his province. The actual surrender came three days later, when 
the first American forces arrived, Malman said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings were marked by an extraordinary degree of rancor between Burstyn 
and Malman. Each man peppered his argument with sarcastic references to the 
other.

WASHINGTON SAYS IT DOES NOT BACK AZERBAIJANI CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE;

The Bush Administration said Wednesday that it does not support demands for an 
independent Azerbaijan and reaffirmed U.S. backing for Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev in his efforts to halt fighting between Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked whether the 
Administration favors independence for the Azerbaijan republic, told reporters: 
"Since 1933, we have recognized the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Tutwiler's terse statement was intended as a diplomatic way 
to convey opposition to Azerbaijani demands for secession and to reaffirm U.S. 
support for Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"If our choice comes down to whether to shore up Gorbachev or let the situation 
collapse into chaos and anarchy . . . we'd rather shore up Gorbachev," a senior 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the prospect that several of the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics 
may seek independence from Moscow, the official asked: "Do we want a bunch of 
independent little states around the periphery of Russia, all at each other's 
throats? Do we want that? And if they become independent, what happens to the 
nuclear weapons that are based there?" 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler and other officials noted, however, that the Administration supports 
independence for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the three Baltic republics 
seized by the Red Army in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a clear distinction between the Balts, who are trying to win their 
independence through negotiations within the Soviet constitution, and the 
Azerbaijanis, who are basically just rioting," one official explained. "There 
are some Azerbaijani organizations that are demanding independence, but they 
aren't doing it in a reasonable fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan, a republic of 7 million people on the Soviet Union's southern 
border with Iran, has been in a state of virtual insurrection since Saturday, 
when riots erupted in the city of Baku on the Caspian Sea.

Gorbachev has dispatched thousands of peacekeeping troops to the area and 
authorized them to use their weapons when necessary. The Administration has 
responded with an unprecedented degree of support for a Soviet leader acting 
against his own citizens. "We understand the need to establish order in a 
situation where order has broken down," White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violence has been directed at the area's ethnic Armenian minority, 
but some Azerbaijani demonstrators have carried flags and signs demanding the 
republic's independence from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tutwiler and other officials played down the prospect of increased 
pressure for secession. "This is not about political people and trying to 
demonstrate," Tutwiler said. "This is an ethnic, age-old tension, age-old 
enemies, and people settling old scores." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Crisis Mentality' 
</P>
<P>
"So far," another official said, "it has not gone beyond the parameters of an 
ethnic conflict to become a political conflict directed against Moscow." Unless 
the Soviet military intervention touches off a full-scale revolt against 
Moscow, he said, "there's nothing that warrants a crisis mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Still, officials said that Administration analysts have been scanning 
intelligence reports from Azerbaijan and other Soviet Asian republics to see 
whether their rising nationalistic movements could turn into a major challenge 
to Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia became Russian possessions in the early 19th 
Century, seized from Iran, then known as Persia, by the czars. After Communists 
seized power in Moscow in 1917, Armenia and Azerbaijan briefly achieved 
independence, but lost it when the Red Army re-established Russian power in 
1920. 
</P>
<P>
The United States refused to recognize the Moscow government for 16 years and 
even sent U.S. troops to Siberia to aid Russian forces trying to overthrow the 
Communist regime. But President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the Soviet 
Union in 1933, accepting the boundaries of the country as they then existed. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years from now, it may make sense for Azerbaijan to be independent," a 
senior official said. "The Soviet Union is, to some extent, an artificial 
construct. But if it falls apart, we may come to miss it" -- because of the 
stability Soviet rule imposed on a fractious part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Administration is concerned about the Soviet Union's ability 
to retain control of its nuclear weapons if revolts erupt in several republics. 
"I just don't believe that there's no way to launch those things without a guy 
in Moscow pushing the button," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials have noted that the Soviet Union has some tactical nuclear 
weapons -- land mines and artillery shells -- that are believed to have 
inadequate safeguards and thus could be used by a rebel force. 
</P>
<P>
All Soviet nuclear weapons are guarded by special troops who are believed to be 
ethnic Russians, they said.

EAST BLOC: A WITCH HUNT COULD PARALYZE THESE NATIONS IN TRANSITION. BUT SOME 
WORRY THAT LENIENCY MAY ENDANGER THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONS.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fate gave Antonin Kapek the second chance he didn't always extend to his 
political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The former Prague Communist Party boss attempted suicide just after the New 
Year, saying he had come under unbearable personal pressure since this 
country's democratic transformation. Ironically, he shot himself with a 
revolver he had been issued for self-protection in 1984 because of his position 
as a party functionary. 
</P>
<P>
But according to his doctor, Marie Dvorakova, Kapek is recovering from both his 
physical and his psychic wounds after a telephone call last weekend from a man 
he had helped persecute for years. 
</P>
<P>
The caller was Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright-turned-president, who, 
according to Dvorakova, "through us wished the patient an early recovery and 
added that he is interested not only in his acquaintances, but in all people, 
and that he doesn't want anybody to be troubled or persecuted." 
</P>
<P>
Havel's action is a particularly dramatic example of what East European experts 
describe as a regionwide trend of leniency by victorious pro-democracy 
movements toward those who served the discredited Communist regimes they 
overthrew in a startling series of mostly peaceful 1989 revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
There are no precise figures available, but all the signs so far are that 
despite what might seem overpowering temptations for revenge, the victors are 
treating the vanquished far better than would surely have been the case if the 
region's political fortunes last year had been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety in Numbers 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts contend that such leniency may even endanger the very future of 
the democratic revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
But for hundreds of thousands of Communist Party faithful, their sheer numbers 
may be their best defense. To engage in an anti-Communist witch hunt, it is 
feared, could paralyze these countries just as they attempt what already 
promises to be a difficult transition to market economies and political 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a choice of shooting the bastards or letting them get away with 
some of their ill-gotten gains in the belief that social harmony is more 
important than rough justice," said Norman Davies, a professor at London 
University's School of Slavonic and East European Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Before last year's political upheavals, there were about 11.5 million Communist 
Party members in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and 
Romania -- more than 10% of the region's total population. That's a far higher 
percentage of party membership than in the Soviet Union, whose 19 million 
registered Communists constitute less than 7% of its population. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller but still substantial number of East Europeans were among the 
so-called nomenklatura -- those people directly appointed to their jobs by the 
party or whose employment had to be approved by party bodies at some level. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the obsession for political reliability in these Soviet-style 
Communist systems that those requiring party approval included government 
bureaucrats, factory directors, school principals, newspaper editors, 
librarians, army officers, trade union officials and even leaders of tiny 
competing parties that were tolerated to maintain the illusion of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The number of such nomenklatura jobs in the region is uncertain, but it is 
believed to have run well into seven figures. In Czechoslovakia alone, the 
party acknowledges about 10,000 direct "apparatus" employees, and it is said to 
have exercised veto power over approximately 500,000 additional positions. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers of non-party members who nevertheless faithfully mouthed the party 
line, or even acted as informers on their neighbors, will never be known. Some 
of these people now claim to have been secret democrats all along, forced by 
job and family considerations to pretend loyalty to the Communists. Others have 
been publicly proclaiming their democratic conversion in an orgy of 
self-recrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admit Opportunism 
</P>
<P>
A Times of London reporter in Bucharest wrote about Romanian professors who 
have taken to prefacing their lectures with admissions of shameless opportunism 
in the past and about Romanian journalists who end their articles with the 
announcement that these are the first true words they have written in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A joke currently making the rounds in Prague says that there are so many 
turncoats on the loose that it's impossible to find a winter jacket in the 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of East Europe's Communists have escaped retribution. 
</P>
<P>
Romania's former dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, and his wife were executed after 
last month's bloody revolution in that country. Sixty Ceausescu relatives and 
top party officials are reported to be under arrest, and trials of captured 
members of the dreaded Securitate secret police have begun. 
</P>
<P>
But given the violence of its revolution and the millions who actively paid 
homage to the late tyrant, even in Romania the retributions have been 
relatively modest, said Jonathan Eyal, an expert on Romania and assistant 
director of London's Royal United Services Institute. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of top hard-line Communist Party officials, such as East Germany's 
Erich Honecker and Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, face possible imprisonment. 
Functionaries of each nation's secret police are particularly despised. And 
untold thousands of full-time Communist Party bureaucrats -- the so-called 
party apparatus -- are looking for real jobs now that party membership is 
plummeting regionwide and new coalition governments such as the one in Poland 
have voted to cut off public funds to the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, a second former Prague party chief, Miroslav Stepan, is 
under arrest and faces up to 10 years in prison for allegedly ordering the 
violent police crackdown against student demonstrators last Nov. 17, the 
incident that sparked the mass uprising here. 
</P>
<P>
Reports surface almost daily about local chapters of the Civic Forum democracy 
movement demanding that someone be fired. Examples include a school principal 
in the town of Chocerady accused of being "captive to Marxist-Leninist 
ideology," a plant manager in Pilsen who wanted to use his "workers' militia" 
to help suppress the democracy movement last November and the head of state 
television who is considered too conservative for the new era. 
</P>
<P>
Given Civic Forum's almost unchallenged power in the current circumstances, and 
the loose coordination even at the organization's center, the possibilities of 
revenge-seeking and other forms of abuse are certainly present. 
</P>
<P>
Still, noted a Western diplomat, Havel and other top Civic Forum leaders have 
promised there will be no widespread purges. 
</P>
<P>
"Some identified in a high-profile way will have to go, but they want to put an 
end to this purge syndrome, where each generation purges the last and, in the 
process, makes enemies out of the purged officials' children from the next." 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum leaders "want to let the best and the brightest rise to the top 
through the normal working of merit," this diplomat added. As competition for 
jobs opens up, the result is expected to be that those among the old 
nomenklatura who were loyal but incompetent will simply sink of their own 
weight. A purge wouldn't be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five of Czechoslovakia's approximately 140 ambassadors have been 
recalled since the interim coalition government took over in early December, 
but most of them had already been scheduled for removal by the previous regime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statute of Limitations 
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor even announced last week that although those who 
collaborated in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion to put down the so-called 
Prague Spring reforms of 1968 were guilty of treason, the statute of 
limitations now applies. 
</P>
<P>
And the new Roman Catholic minister of the interior, Richard Sacher, said that 
although he intends to punish those police officers who abused their positions 
under the Communist regime, he sees no reason to fire those who simply obeyed 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
In both Poland and Hungary, there have been complaints that middle-level 
Communist officials have been taking advantage of their privileged positions to 
set themselves up in emerging, lucrative business opportunities -- 
disappearing, as Eyal put it, "under dark pinstripe suits." 
</P>
<P>
Polish sociologist Jadwiga Staniszkis called the phenomenon "the privatization 
of the nomenklatura" and said its spread is "very rapid." In one case, she 
said, party officials in a district near the Soviet border declared their area 
a free-trade zone, gaining tax advantages for an import-export business. 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, according to Eyal, some factory managers have capitalized on new 
joint-venture laws to find foreign investors who give them a healthy stake in 
reorganized companies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their sheer numbers, there is another argument for dealing 
cautiously with the former loyalists: Given the Communists' 40-year monopoly on 
power in the region, they are about the only people with the practical 
experience necessary to run a government. 
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that engaging in a widespread purge would back the 
bureaucrats into a corner where they might see fighting as their only 
alternative. The alternative approach is to avoid unnecessary rocking of the 
boat in hopes that the Communist bureaucrats will evolve into normal, 
Western-style civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, protesters in Romania, East Germany and -- to a lesser 
extent, elsewhere -- worry that their revolutions may be "hijacked" by 
so-called reform Communists who will frustrate supposedly free elections 
scheduled throughout the region this year -- elections meant to fortify the 
move toward truly democratic systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Are Fueled 
</P>
<P>
Fears that unpurged Communist loyalists may even act as Fifth Columnists were 
fueled earlier this month when Hungarian opposition leaders produced evidence 
at a press conference of Watergate-style election spying by elements of the 
still-functioning secret police. And in Romania, the concern is such that 
people gossip, despite official denials, about well-armed Securitate forces 
supposedly hiding out in the hills, waiting for an opportunity to strike again. 
</P>
<P>
Eyal contends that the real danger to Eastern Europe's democratic revolutions 
is not so much Communist Fifth Columnists as popular cynicism. These are 
populations weaned on a fundamental distrust of power, he noted. By being so 
lenient toward those who served the Communists, the democratic movements only 
encourage the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they continue to be there, you don't have the legitimacy these 
governments need," he said, adding that this is "potentially one of the biggest 
disasters of the revolution in Eastern Europe."

IRAN WARNS AGAINST 'HARSH' SOVIET MOVES IN AZERBAIJAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, warned Wednesday against 
"miscalculated and harsh" measures by Soviet troops in the strife-torn Soviet 
republic of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
But displaying the caution that has marked Iranian comments on the violence in 
Azerbaijan, Khamenei leavened his warning with praise for the loosening of 
religious restraints under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Azerbaijanis -- the majority of them are Shiite Muslims as are 
their Iranian relatives across the border -- are asserting themselves as 
Muslims after decades of religious suppression. 
</P>
<P>
As the ayatollah's remarks were reported here, he did not dwell on the bloody 
clashes between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, who are largely Christian. The 
official Iranian news agency quoted him as saying: "It is a great blunder to 
think that ethnic and national motives are behind this. The sentiments are 
Islamic and have their attractions for 1 billion Muslims worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Vaezi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, took the same line Tuesday at a 
meeting in Tehran with Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Gudev, according to an 
Iranian state television report. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the peaceful settlement of problems and paying attention to the 
people's demands can create grounds for preventing violent clashes," Vaezi was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Muslims occupy a belt of Soviet territory just across the border 
from Iran, and Moscow has kept a close watch on Iranian fundamentalism over the 
past decade. The bond between the people on both sides is a sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian television continued to show film of Soviet Azerbaijanis crossing the 
Araks River, which divides them from their ethnic brethren in Iran. The Iranian 
news agency reported that 30 crossed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have said they are seeking an agreement with Moscow to permit 
50,000 Soviet Azerbaijanis to cross the border annually. The Iranian press 
quoted a Soviet television station in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, as saying 
a high-ranking Soviet delegation will visit Tehran before the end of the month 
to discuss the travel regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani nationalists on the Soviet side have been demonstrating for a more 
open border for the last two weeks. On the opposite bank, their Iranian kin 
have encouraged them.

DELAY IN EXECUTIONS FRUSTRATES HIM AND THE PUBLIC, GOVERNOR DECLARES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMINAL JUSTICE: DEUKMEJIAN BLAMES DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND PREDICTS THAT THE 
RETURN OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WILL DETER SOME POTENTIAL KILLERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who wrote the death penalty law under which San Diego 
murderer Robert Alton Harris was sentenced to the gas chamber, said Wednesday 
that both he and the public have become frustrated waiting for the resumption 
of executions in California. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed defense attorneys who "always seem to be able to come up with some 
new approach to delay the implementation of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian predicted that the return of capital punishment -- which could occur 
with Harris' execution sometime in the spring -- will deter some murders. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his "long-held view that capital punishment is appropriate for 
anyone that commits willful, deliberate, premeditated murder," the governor 
insisted that he has not prejudged an expected clemency request by Harris, a 
twice-convicted felon who was sentenced to death 11 years ago for killing two 
teen-age boys while stealing their car for a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Harris' broad challenge to his 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a request for clemency," Deukmejian pledged, "then I will 
certainly give it very thorough and very serious consideration in keeping with 
my responsibilities as governor." 
</P>
<P>
At a wide-ranging Los Angeles press conference, Deukmejian also: 
</P>
<P>
* Made it clear, without saying so specifically, that he would veto a bill 
currently being rushed through the Legislature to restore $20 million in family 
planning funds he cut last year. "The Legislature is acting too hastily and 
should not push forward on this issue" while his legal authority to cut the 
funds is being challenged in the courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that argument, the governor has signaled that he does not care much for 
the legislation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
* Asserted that Southern Californians should not be worried about the aerial 
spraying of pesticides in the war against the Mediterranean fruit fly. "I can 
certainly understand some of the concerns of residents having helicopters 
flying over their areas," he said. "But they shouldn't be concerned about any 
dangerous effect of the spraying of malathion. It has been conclusively 
established that it is not harmful to anybody. . . . The amount that is sprayed 
is really minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
* Called upon Los Angeles city officials to drop their "frivolous suit" seeking 
to block construction of a state prison in an industrial area east of downtown. 
"City officials are saying with this lawsuit, 'not in my back yard,' " 
Deukmejian said. "However, the facts are that 40% of the convicted felons in 
this state do come from their (Los Angeles County) back yard and it appears as 
though the city intends to treat convicted criminals as a principal export from 
this area to other parts of the state." 
</P>
<P>
"What's more," the governor continued, "this facility will be an economic boon 
to the area. . . . Anybody who visited that area could see it could use some 
improvement. And this facility would be a major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's press secretary, Robert Gore, said later that the governor also 
feels strongly that a second controversial state prison should be built in Los 
Angeles County near Lancaster. The Board of Supervisors is trying to block 
construction of that penitentiary, too. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who long has battled against the proposed Eastside 
prison, said the city has no intention of withdrawing its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian held his press conference as part of a strategy to get around the 
state and reacquaint himself with Californians while promoting the programs he 
is pushing during his final year as governor. A recent statewide survey by The 
Times Poll found that four in 10 voters could not name a state problem that 
Deukmejian had dealt with successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters, rather than the governor, raised the issue of capital punishment -- 
more specifically, the Harris case. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was frustrated by the fact that nobody has been executed in 
California for 23 years, yet as a state senator he pushed through legislation 
13 years ago aimed at restoring capital punishment, Deukmejian replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly. Not only do I have frustration, I know that the overwhelming 
majority of the people in the state are frustrated. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, the defense lawyers always seem to be able to come up with some 
new approach. . . ."

GUN CONTROL ACTIVISTS FACE A HARDER FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: ACTIVISTS WON AN ASSAULT WEAPON BAN LAST YEAR. BUT THEY ARE NOT 
FINDING THE SAME SUPPORT FOR A WAITING PERIOD ON RIFLE AND SHOTGUN SALES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Activists who last year overcame the fierce opposition of gun-owner 
organizations to outlaw assault weapons in the wake of the Stockton schoolyard 
murders are finding the political fires harder to relight for a separate 
control bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill for the first time would extend to sporting rifles and shotguns the 
15-day waiting period already required for the purchase of a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento) seeks to 
keep all firearms out of the hands of people who have been involuntarily 
committed for mental evaluations and those who have committed gun-related 
misdemeanor crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Connelly bill passed the Assembly but failed by seven votes in 
the Senate in the final days of the session. At the time, Connelly blamed the 
National Rifle Assn. for exerting what he called immense pressure on the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Connelly and Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), co-author of 
the assault gun legislation, are preparing for a second run at winning in the 
Senate. This is an especially difficult task because 1990 is an election year 
and legislators are especially chary about gun control issues. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the NRA, which boasts that its 280,000 California members "remember 
and vote," is lobbying hard to defeat the 15-day waiting-period bill. NRA 
lobbyist Brian Judy said members are being urged to contact legislators and 
demand a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
Judy and other gun-owner representatives assert that the waiting period would 
be an unnecessary burden on the law-abiding citizens. They favor a computerized 
"instant" background check, a proposal that state officials maintain is not now 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti indicated on Wednesday that he now counts 19 of the 21 votes needed for 
Senate approval of the bill. He said he expects to bring the bill to a vote by 
mid-February and secure the other two votes needed by "sort of putting feet to 
the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Although legislators for years had tried to ban assault weapons, it was the 
murders one year ago of five Stockton schoolchildren by a deranged drifter with 
an assault rifle that galvanized public support for a ban on such weapons. 
Twenty-nine other students and a teacher were wounded before gunman Patrick 
Purdy killed himself with a legally purchased pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian was among those who came out in support of both the 
assault gun legislation and the 15-day wait for rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
But the highly successful coalition of police, teachers, physicians, Los 
Angeles neighborhood associations, gun control activists and others who fought 
for the assault gun legislation has largely dissolved and moved on to other 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Medical Assn. and the California Teachers Assn., 
for example, said Wednesday that their groups have not yet taken a position on 
the Connelly bill. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Tolley, California director of Handgun Control Inc., said his organization 
is "trying to rekindle" the political fires that helped to pave the way for 
passage of the assault gun legislation last year and has zeroed in on five key 
senators. They are Democrats Wadie Deddeh of Bonita, Dan McCorquodale of San 
Jose, Rose Ann Vuich of Dinuba and Republicans Marion Bergeson of Newport Beach 
and William Craven of Oceanside.

UNHAPPY WITH WILSON, GOP GROUP MAKES A PITCH FOR UEBERROTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
So far they are merely pebbles on Pete Wilson's road to the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination. But -- undeterred by the odds -- a handful of Los 
Angeles area conservatives has launched a desperate effort to get a second name 
on the GOP primary ballot: Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, president of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and, until last 
year, the commissioner of major league baseball, was unsuccessfully courted a 
year ago by both major political parties for the governor's race. He has not 
sanctioned the current attempt. But a letter the group says it received from 
him in November -- attesting that he had "not made a firm decision" about 
running -- was enough to stoke the optimism of the anti-Wilson activists. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Ueberroth encompasses the qualities that Ronald Reagan did," said Leslie 
Dutton of Santa Monica-based California Pro-Family Women's Coalition, 
expressing the highest praise imaginable from a conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't often run into a candidate that there's nothing wrong with," 
seconded Paddy Lackey, immediate past president of the Sacramento Suburban 
Republican Women and an ally of the local activists. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they have looked deeply into Ueberroth's positions. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth has described himself as conservative on business, defense and 
foreign policy and more liberal on social issues -- in other words, almost a 
twin to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the would-be drafters oppose Wilson because of the senator's pro-choice 
stand on abortion. But Ueberroth, too, has said he is pro-choice. Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not familiar with that at all," said Dutton, dismissing any conflict. 
"Most of us are not familiar with his political background because he's not run 
for office." 
</P>
<P>
If not for the issues, why bother mounting such a long-shot campaign, which so 
far has drawn only disdain from the Republican Establishment? Because the 
activists' reasons for disliking Wilson are many. 
</P>
<P>
They object to the senator's recent campaign proposal that would increase the 
number of counselors and other social services providers in the state's school 
system. They have not forgiven him for refusing last year to deny party 
recognition to gay Republican clubs. And they question his loyalty to the 
Republican right, citing his support of moderate Gerald R. Ford over Reagan in 
the 1976 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition, the group, almost entirely women, is bridling at its limited 
influence within the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson provides a tempting target because he entered the governor's race at the 
behest of the state's top Republicans, who were scrambling for a strong 
candidate after Gov. George Deukmejian decided against seeking another term. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the disgruntled women) are asked to do the work, and they're not given 
any say," Dutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted by The Times, Ueberroth declined to comment. Wilson's office did not 
answer requests for comment. And Steve Johnson, executive director of the Los 
Angeles County Republican Party, dismissed the group as "12 ladies who have a 
lot of people on their stationery." 
</P>
<P>
The group's maiden effort got off to a rocky start. A half-dozen stood outside 
a county Republican meeting Tuesday night, handing out flyers asking supporters 
to urge Ueberroth to run. The flyers -- which included Ueberroth's Newport 
Beach business address -- and the drafters got drenched by rain. 
</P>
<P>
The nonconfrontational tone of their protest disintegrated rapidly, too. As 
Dutton and others were readying a press conference, a Ueberroth supporter and a 
Wilson backer screamed at each other, concluding their battle with an exchange 
of slaps. 
</P>
<P>
"You were yelling in my face," Stephanie Kennedy, the Ueberroth supporter 
yelled at the unidentified man who slapped her after she had slapped him. 
"You're an animal!"

U.S. airlines had 11 fatal crashes last year, the most in a single year since 
1968, the National Transportation Safety Board reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 278 people were killed in 1989 in flights involving scheduled and 
non-scheduled air carriers, down from the 285 in 1988, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
The most deadly year of the decade was 1985, when 526 people were killed in 
seven fatal commercial aviation accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Also last year, 763 people died in accidents involving private or general 
aircraft, the safety board said, the lowest figure for that category since it 
began keeping statistics. There were 781 deaths involving general aviation 
accidents in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The board said the fatal accident rate for general or private aviation 
continued "an improving trend that lasted most of the decade." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high number of airline accidents involving fatalities last year, 
the overall accident rate for commercial air carriers and commuters declined, 
the safety board reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were 28 accidents involving U.S. scheduled and charter airlines last 
year, a decrease from the 32 accidents recorded in 1988. The 11 involving 
fatalities were the most since the 15 of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents involving scheduled airlines took 131 lives last year, 111 of them 
when a United Airlines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, on July 19. The 
safety board noted that a passenger who died 31 days after the accident was not 
registered in its statistics.

FIRST INTERSTATE CHAIRMAN PINOLA WILL RETIRE IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Interstate Bancorp Chairman Joseph J. Pinola, who aggressively built the 
nation's largest interstate banking network but bid unsuccessfully for rival 
BankAmerica, announced Wednesday that he will retire June 1. 
</P>
<P>
Pinola, who turns 65 on May 13, will be succeeded as chairman and chief 
executive by Edward M. Carson, 60. Both moves were expected. Carson, currently 
president of the Los Angeles-based banking company and former head of its 
Arizona operation, is expected to cut costs and monitor daily operations more 
closely than Pinola. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, First Interstate's announcement came one day after its chief 
Los Angeles banking rival, Security Pacific Corp., disclosed that Richard J. 
Flamson III will step down as chief executive to be succeeded by Robert H. 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's move comes at a critical point for the nation's 10th-largest 
banking firm. It follows two years of turmoil that included big losses stemming 
from soft real estate values in Arizona and an ill-fated 1988 acquisition of a 
Texas bank. It also has been hurt by a plunging stock price that has made it 
vulnerable to takeover bids, and a spectacular May, 1988, fire that destroyed 
four floors of its downtown headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's strategy of operating banks in 14 states, and franchising 
banks in still others, is being increasingly questioned. The company sometimes 
is viewed like an engine that is chronically out of tune. Losses in Texas and 
Arizona units are offsetting strong profits in California, Washington, Oregon 
and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, First Interstate is expected to announce a quarterly loss that some 
securities analysts have projected may exceed $200 million, stemming from $400 
million being set aside for real estate problems in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Those losses stem from the untimely acquisition for $161 million of Allied 
Bancshares in Texas, a move both Pinola and Carson acknowledged as a mistake in 
separate interviews Wednesday. First Interstate bought the ailing bank with no 
federal assistance. Rivals such as NCNB in North Carolina and Banc One in Ohio 
later were given assistance to buy similarly troubled banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry I made one giant mistake, but I added a lot of territory to the 
bank. I feel good about every aspect except Texas," Pinola said. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing Carson, First Interstate's directors stuck to the bank's 
traditional, conservative method of succession. In recent months, there had 
been rumors that directors might be considering an outsider or might leapfrog 
the younger William E. B. Siart into the job. Siart, 43, who heads First 
Interstate's California operation, was named to replace Carson as president, 
putting him first in line to succeed Carson as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
But Pinola said the order of transition has been clear for a long time. He 
compared the method of succession to something like a baseball farm system, 
where executives serve at other banks in the company before returning to 
headquarters. Carson headed First Interstate's Arizona operations before it was 
hit by problems, and has served in most other areas of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco-based bank analyst Donald K. Crowley of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; 
Woods called Carson a "journeyman banker" whose record in Arizona was 
admirable. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 3-inch Carson became a banker by chance. The son of a truck driver 
from Peoria, Ariz., he studied marketing and advertising at Arizona State 
University in the early 1950s, playing basketball and serving as student body 
president. While in school there, he led a drive to raise money to build a 
student union building. One of the Phoenix executives he hit up for money ran 
the First National Bank of Arizona, the bank that evolved into First 
Interstate's operation there today. Carson impressed the executive, who hired 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said he supports interstate banking as a concept, and said he probably 
will be more involved in daily operations than Pinola. Carson also said he 
probably would not launch the kind of takeover bid like the one that Pinola 
launched three years ago for BankAmerica, although he was quick to add that he 
supported the bid at the time. BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America, 
successfully spurned the $3.9-billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances describe Carson as methodical and more of an operations 
executive. Siart, in an interview, called Carson a "hands-on, 
take-care-of-the-machine-you've-got kind of guy" as opposed to Pinola, whom 
Siart called a visionary. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of Carson's methodical approach is a vacation home in the Arizona 
mountains he has been building himself, doing much of the carpentry and other 
work. Carson said he has been working on the home off and on for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Both Carson and Siart will move to deal directly with problems in Texas and 
Arizona. Siart disclosed that he will spend more time dealing with problems in 
Texas, while Carson will deal with problems in Arizona because he is more 
familiar with it. 
</P>
<P>
One sensitive subject is First Interstate's vulnerability to a takeover, fanned 
by periodic comments from Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt that he would 
like to buy First Interstate if Pinola only wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Pinola's belief, according to people familiar with his thinking, is that 
shareholders could not get a good deal with the stock so low. He also is said 
to fear that any takeover would result in a blood bath where many employees are 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Carson earned cash compensation of $638,510, while Pinola earned 
$950,916.

INNOVATION: LEARNING FROM A SOFTWARE GLITCH AT AT&amp;T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday's glitch-infested shutdown of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's 
long-distance network was one of the best things that could have happened. With 
the shock of a grand mal fit or a heart attack -- but without the long-term 
pain or debilitation -- AT&amp;T's software seizure sends exactly the right 
message to everyone who uses or designs complex networks. That message? 
</P>
<P>
Don't take us for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Back in October, this column pointed out that the increasingly software-driven 
nature of our telecommunications networks made bugs inevitable. "The real 
question," that column said, "is whether this network evolution will hatch 
little bugs that merely annoy or big bugs that can wipe out phone service for 
millions of people at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Now we know. 
</P>
<P>
But the real issue isn't bugs and software; it's how do we design for and 
manage complexity? That's the real challenge; the software is just the medium 
we use to express it. Unfortunately, complexity is the sworn enemy of 
reliability. Striking the best balance between them is extraordinarily 
difficult. Compared to a decade ago, our telephone networks are extraordinarily 
complex things. We want our phones and phone lines to have call waiting, call 
forwarding, computer modems, perfect instantaneous transmission, fax 
capabilities and a dial tone the millisecond we pick up the receiver. We want 
functionality and reliability. Is all that realistic? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, yes. What's unrealistic is the idiotic belief that you don't have 
to make any trade-offs at all. There's a sign you can see in many craft and 
repair shops. It goes: "Fast, Good, Cheap -- Pick any two." 
</P>
<P>
The question is: what trade-offs are people prepared to make? AT&amp;T and the 
phone companies have had a long and excellent tradition of providing 
high-quality, highly reliable voice and data communications networks. Their 
network design is optimized around making sure there are no disruptions in 
service. The catch is that, in the unlikely event that something does go wrong, 
it's more difficult to hunt the problem down and solve it quickly. In other 
words, these networks are not designed to be easily maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Titanic effect," says Gerald M. Weinberg, a Lincoln, Neb.-based 
software consultant who frequently works with large telecommunications 
companies. "If you think you're piloting an unsinkable ship, it's 'Damn the 
icebergs, full speed ahead!' " 
</P>
<P>
While Weinberg stresses that he has enormous respect for AT&amp;T's software 
tradition and skills, he points out that one of the most important qualities 
for truly great systems design is humility. With software, the issue isn't 
whether there will be bugs -- the issue is how do you hunt them down and squash 
them when they surface? 
</P>
<P>
Monday's events tell us that we need a more pragmatic design ethic for software 
-- an ethic that stresses ease of maintenance as much as reliability. We can't 
trust complex software to always be reliable -- but if we can identify and fix 
an unanticipated software glitch in less than a minute, the network won't be 
down for hours. AT&amp;T rightfully prides itself for building a network that 
is "self-diagnostic" and "self-healing" on many levels. But the reality is 
that, as the complex interactions of sophisticated software have multiplied, 
the company's traditional methods to assure network integrity are no longer 
good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Monday wasn't an anomaly, and MCI and US Sprint would be well advised not to 
snicker to AT&amp;T's customers. We have entered a time when consumers, 
corporations and systems designers will take trade-offs seriously instead of 
treating them like an intellectual exercise. The emerging emphasis on software 
maintenance is a clear signal that complexity has finally caught up with us. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three levels of software complexity," Weinberg warns. "There's the 
complexity of the job itself, the complexity of the way you do the job and then 
there's the complexity of the environment in which you're doing the job." 
Because all three of those dimensions are rising in complexity, says Weinberg, 
designing for maintainability is the best way to assure that reliability is 
even possible. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true for the local telephone switch network -- the 
computer that handles everything from call waiting and call forwarding to the 
dial tone. "The first objective of our network is to get it up and running," 
says Bruce D. Gesner, Pacific Bell's executive director for technology 
introduction and support. "Now it's time to pay more and more attention to 
maintainability. We will be focusing more and more on designing systems that 
allow us to monitor better and allow us to catch problems before they escalate 
into disasters." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gesner is overseeing Pacific Bell's planned introduction of the "out of 
band" signaling system -- the system with the software that AT&amp;T has 
identified as being responsible for its network trauma. "We are working 
aggressively to develop maintenance techniques to manage that," he promises. 
</P>
<P>
While it's highly unlikely that a software bug lurking in the local loop will 
kill off your dial tone, the increased levels of functionality and complexity 
in your local switch makes it more likely that software-induced hiccups and 
burps will make service a little less reliable. On the other hand, potential 
problems should be identified, captured and destroyed more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of Monday's mess is that we can no longer afford to take the 
richness and complexity of our networks for granted. When you stop taking 
something for granted, there's a tremendous opportunity for generating new 
ideas, new approaches and unusual innovations. What happened Monday isn't a 
sign that something's rotten in the state of software; it's a sign that it's 
time to treat our complex systems with the respect and care they deserve.

In recent months, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has tweaked its 
competitors with a series of ads showing rivals' foul-ups in long-distance 
services. One ad shows an annoyed man sitting at his desk throwing cards on the 
floor while waiting for an AT&amp;T competitor to make a long-distance 
connection. In another, a caller trying to dial Philadelphia finds himself 
talking to someone in Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
The ads stress AT&amp;T's long record of reliability and imply that those 
problems are what happen when you put your fate in the hands of young upstarts. 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T's long-distance breakdown on Monday -- its worst system failure 
ever -- makes it look like the bad guy that makes customers wait to reach 
Philadelphia. Analysts wondered how much more market share Ma Bell may lose to 
its charged-up rivals, noting that the breakdown will force many customers to 
seek linkups with backup carriers as a sort of insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
The debacle couldn't have come at a worse time for AT&amp;T, which controls 
about two-thirds of the nation's long-distance market. Its aggressive ads and 
stepped-up marketing in recent months had succeeded in significantly slowing 
the loss of market share to a slew of smaller competitors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
A much humbled AT&amp;T spent the last two days apologizing and promising some 
token to soothe ill feelings -- about which it will announce specific plans 
today. The company had said it would seek permission from the Federal 
Communications Commission to offer a day of discounted long-distance services, 
but sources said Wednesday that AT&amp;T was considering seeking permission to 
expand the discounts beyond one day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major competitors were pondering how hard they should kick the giant 
while it's down. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been handed an opportunity," said Michael J. Furtney, director of 
corporate relations for US Sprint, which ran ads after Hurricane Hugo and the 
Bay Area earthquake capitalizing on some problems AT&amp;T had with broken 
lines and extremely heavy volume. This time, Sprint doesn't have to stretch 
itself too much to respond, Furtney said. "All we have to do is raise our hand 
and say there is another alternative," he added. 
</P>
<P>
MCI Communications said it had no plans to change its marketing. "We're already 
pretty aggressive," said company spokesman Bernard Goodrich. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the major benefit for AT&amp;T's competitors is that the massive 
breakdown makes a compelling argument that no major business should depend on 
one long-distance company. "They can make the case that it is like having only 
one bridge into the city," said Gregory Sawyers, an analyst with Sanford C. 
Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York. Many companies are already using more than one 
service, he said. "This will accelerate the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said AT&amp;T's competitors should be cautious in how far they go 
in attacking AT&amp;T. If they make too much of the technical breakdown, "they 
could be setting themselves up," said David J. Boczar, an analyst with New 
Japan Securities in New York. "It could happen to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown is by no means a fatal blow for AT&amp;T, analysts said. But it 
knocks the wind out of AT&amp;T's boasts of technical superiority, they added. 
"What this may point out is that AT&amp;T has some of the same hardware and 
software problems as everybody else," said Steven Kropper, program manager for 
International Data Corp., a technology market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
While AT&amp;T may suffer short term, many analysts said the damage will be 
mitigated by two factors. "The key item to make note of is that AT&amp;T has a 
very strong track record," said Paul Aran, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, AT&amp;T's management didn't falter in the crisis. "I think they 
responded very well. They acknowledged the mistake, apologized and promise to 
try to make it up," Sawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AT&amp;T's quick offer to provide restitution demonstrates a new 
level of aggressiveness at the company. For a time, AT&amp;T was not adverse to 
losing some market share, reasoning that it would stem tighter government 
regulation of the company, Boczar said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they feel comfortable with the current market share" and have moved 
aggressively to prevent erosion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said the company is reassessing specific ads, 
but any changes "will have no bearing" on the basic message of AT&amp;T's 
reliability.

JAPAN EXTENDS VOLUNTARY QUOTA ON CAR EXPORTS TO U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THE DECISION IS CONSIDERED SYMBOLIC BECAUSE OF DECLINING U.S. DEMAND AND 
INCREASING JAPANESE AUTO PRODUCTION IN AMERICA.

The Japanese government announced Wednesday that it will extend its 
self-imposed quota on exports of cars to the United States for another year, a 
symbolic move apparently aimed at cooling trade friction rather than imposing 
any immediate restraint on trade. 
</P>
<P>
Hikaru Matsunaga, the minister of international trade and industry, said at a 
news conference that the voluntary ceiling of 2.3 million autos will continue 
for the next fiscal year, which begins April 1. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is extremely unlikely that the decision will affect trade flows. 
For the last two years, Japanese manufacturers have not exported enough cars to 
the United States to trigger the restraints, partly because of the shift by 
Japanese companies to production in the United States and partly because of the 
decline in demand in the U.S. auto market. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any economic justification for this; I think it's aimed at the 
U.S. Congress," said Keisuke Kasugi, an auto industry analyst in Tokyo for the 
brokerage W. I. Carr. "It would be politically impossible to abolish the quota 
at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, persuaded 
the Japanese auto industry to accept a program of "voluntary" self-restraint in 
1981, when troubled U.S. car makers were rapidly losing market share to a flood 
of Japanese exports. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese industry leaders now dismiss the quotas as obsolete, however, 
especially since exports are steadily on the decline with the major 
manufacturers operating plants in the United States. Japan is expected to ship 
an estimated 2.05 million cars to the U.S. market in the fiscal year that ends 
March 31, down from 2.18 million units in the previous year, Matsunaga said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. and one of the most outspoken 
critics of the quota, told reporters that he found MITI's decision 
"regrettable." But he conceded that it was made "after a comprehensive review 
of the existing state of relations between Japan and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga said the softening U.S. demand for cars, expected to fall to 9.5 
million to 9.6 million units this year from last year's 9.9 million, was a 
major consideration for leaving the quotas intact. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made in consideration of various factors such as the demand 
outlook . . . foreign exchange fluctuations and Japanese cars in stock in the 
United States," Matsunaga said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent decline in the value of the yen against the dollar has raised 
concern that Japan's foreign exchange advantage -- leading to lower prices 
abroad -- may once again spark a surge in Japanese car exports. Automobiles 
remain the largest component of Japan's $50-billion trade surplus with the 
United States.

Chrysler to Trim Output at 3 Plants: Production rates at three Chrysler Corp. 
assembly plants will be cut in March, resulting in the indefinite layoffs of 
more than 2,000 workers, the company said. Spokesman Doug Nicoll blamed the 
moves on slow sales. The cuts are due at Chrysler's plants in Belvidere, Ill.; 
Newark, Del., and Toledo, Ohio, which make some of the company's most 
profitable cars and Jeeps.

Venezuela Threatens to Halt Debt Servicing: Venezuela has raised the stakes in 
its debt restructuring talks, threatening to withhold interest payments on its 
$21 billion of debt owed to foreign banks unless new loans are provided, 
bankers who attended the negotiating sessions in New York said. The country has 
already missed interest payment deadlines in January and has fallen into 
arrears, they said. They described the threat as a tactic to pressure reluctant 
bank lenders into extending new loans and agreeing to a restructuring of the 
country's foreign debt.

U.S. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION FALLS; IMPORTS HIT HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
U.S. crude oil production last year recorded its biggest decline ever while oil 
imports reached a 10-year high, the American Petroleum Institute reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, a trade association of the major oil companies, also said that 
although U.S. oil consumption increased only slightly, imports rose to 46% of 
total supplies. That was the second-highest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing the data, Edward H. Murphy, an API official, said the production 
and import trends were "very disturbing and should be a focus of national 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
The figures confirm a continued decline of the domestic oil industry and are 
expected to add heat to a debate in Congress this year over whether exploration 
and production companies should get new tax breaks to stimulate drilling 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has argued that declining U.S. oil production and 
increasing reliance on foreign producers is undermining national energy 
security. 
</P>
<P>
In its year-end report, the petroleum institute said U.S. crude oil production 
averaged 7.6 million barrels a day in 1989. That was the lowest in 26 years and 
a record decline of 553,000 barrels per day, or 6.8%, from the 1988 total. 
</P>
<P>
The previous biggest decline in domestic oil output was 474,000 barrels per day 
in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Alaskan oil production, which had increased almost every year since the start 
of production from the huge Prudhoe Bay field in 1977, fell by 140,000 barrels 
per day in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the Alaska decline was exaggerated by maintenance work and 
traffic restrictions following the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill last March, 
and that the "underlying decline trend" in Alaska was about 100,000 barrels per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Oil imports rose to 7.9 million barrels a day last year, up 8.2% from 1988 and 
nearly 60% above the 1985 level, when imports sank to a low of 5 million 
barrels a day before prices collapsed on the world market in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that while imports from Western Hemisphere sources still 
accounted for about 43% of total imports in 1989, imports from the Persian Gulf 
continued to grow to 21% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Imports accounted for 46% of oil consumed in the United States last year. That 
was the second-highest ever, after the 47.7% level of 1977. As recently as 
1985, imports' share of domestic consumption was only 31.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in total U.S. energy consumption last year slowed to 1.9% after 
increases of 3.5% in 1987 and 4% in 1988, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, API's director of finance, accounting and statistics, told a news 
conference: "I believe that it is particularly noteworthy that the increase in 
imports was driven not by increases in consumption, which has been the most 
important factor until last year, but by decreases in domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
"While few analysts, myself included, are confident about our ability to 
anticipate developments in petroleum markets with great precision, most see 
substantial decreases in U.S. production, combined with moderate increases in 
consumption, leading to substantial increases in our demand for foreign crude 
oil," he said.

Stock prices fell to an eight-week low Wednesday under a barrage of late 
selling attributed to disappointing economic and earnings news. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 33.49 to 2,659.13, its lowest 
close since it stood at 2,656.78 on Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Since the index hit a record closing high of 2,810.15 in the first session of 
1990 on Jan. 2, it has retreated 153.37 points, or 5.46%. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 649 up, 867 down and 462 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a widening of the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5 billion in November 
from $10.25 billion in October caught some market participants off guard. A 
separate government report on industrial production seemed to signal that 
manufacturing remained sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also said earnings reports from International Business Machines and 
Alcoa provided little assurance for investors who have been waiting uneasily 
for fourth-quarter profit figures. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, which said its fourth-quarter earnings shrank to $1.04 a share from $3.97 
a share in the like period a year earlier, dropped 1 1/4 to 98 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum Co. of America, another component of the Dow, fell 5 7/8 to 66 7/8 
after the company came in with lower quarterly profits. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoa's news appeared to drag down other basic industry stocks as well. Phelps 
Dodge dropped 7/8 to 59; International Paper fell 3/8 to 52 1/8; Dow Chemical 
slipped 1 3/8 to 67 7/8, and DuPont fell 1 5/8 to 121 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Caterpillar Inc., which is expected to post its results for the fourth quarter 
Thursday, lost 2 1/8 to 54 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Aristech Chemical was the volume leader, up 1/2 at 25 1/8. A management-led 
group has proposed a buyout for $26 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 170.47 million shares, down from Tuesday's 186.07 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, late selling erased gains of more than 400 points to leave the Nikkei 
average slightly lower. The 225-share Nikkei slipped 29.22 points to end at 
36,821.14 after plunging 666.41 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A late rally carried share prices to a modest gain for the session on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 24.8 points, or 
1.1%, to close at 2,373.9.

Bonds Close Mixed After Early Gains 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed following Tuesday's sharp selloff. Prices of 
shorter-term issues rose slightly, while longer-term bonds slipped. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond declined 1/8 point, or $1.25 for 
every $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which rises when its price falls, 
edged up to 8.25% from 8.24% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices started the day by recovering, buoyed by a bout of 
bargain-hunting and the government's report on the U.S. trade deficit. Later, 
however, bond prices lost much of their early gains. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.188%, up from 8.125% late Tuesday.

Dollar Trips Over Poor Trade Report 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected widening of the U.S. trade deficit sent the dollar falling 
against most foreign currencies Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said investors were concerned because the poor trade 
performance in November was partly due to a drop in exports. Some analysts 
believed that the decline indicated a further slowing of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in 
Chicago, said any possible upward moves by the dollar were being limited by 
traders' skeptical view of the economy. However, he said, the U.S. currency was 
"beginning to base at these levels." 
</P>
<P>
Although the trade news pushed the dollar lower, foreign exchange traders 
largely focused on the West German mark and other currencies, Holzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas dealers said continuing tensions in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe gave the dollar some underlying support. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar did manage a gain against the British pound. In London, one pound 
cost $1.6525 late Wednesday, cheaper than late Tuesday's $1.6560. In later New 
York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.65235, down from $1.6585 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.52 Japanese yen, down from 145.75 yen 
Tuesday. In London, the dollar closed at 145.45 yen, and in New York, it rose 
to 145.395 yen from late Tuesday's 145.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose $1.70 
to $412.50 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of 
$412.90, up $3.10 from late Tuesday.

Oil Prices Plummet as Supplies Increase 
</P>
<P>
Oil and gasoline futures prices plummeted after an industry report showed an 
increase in U.S. stocks of petroleum products after several weeks of declining 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals futures rose, livestock and meat 
futures were higher, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 68 cents lower to 4 cents higher, 
with the contract for delivery in February at $22.10 a barrel; heating oil was 
0.60 cent to 3.51 cents lower, with February at 60.52 cents a gallon, and 
unleaded gasoline was 1.45 to 2.88 cents lower, with February at 61.42 cents a 
gallon.

One day after Security Pacific said its top officers would pass the helm on to 
their heirs apparent, First Interstate announced its chief executive -- Joseph 
J. Pinola -- is planning to retire in June and leave the leadership of Los 
Angeles' second-largest banking company to Edward M. Carson, First Interstate's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
But the coincidental timing of the top management changes at the city's two 
largest banks is where the similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
The two banks, which have taken on widely disparate roles over the past several 
years, are likely to become even more diverse in the future because of the 
legacies left by former managers, analysts said. Ultimately, their different 
paths will determine whether these banks will emerge as survivors of a 
predicted banking industry shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
While Security is likely to grow, First Interstate is likely to shrink. 
Security is likely to be buying more banks, launching new products and opening 
diverse operations over the years to maintain its leadership position in 
merchant and international banking. But First Interstate may be trying to sell 
units and cut back on products and services in an effort to stem losses. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate is also widely considered a prime takeover target. Security's 
Smith said Tuesday that he'd be willing to talk about buying the company if 
First Interstate was amenable. 
</P>
<P>
"First Interstate has to go back to basics, like tackling expense reduction. 
And ultimately, they will probably have to consolidate the banks," said Carole 
Berger, banking analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York. The 
bank must also develop a long-term strategic plan, which has been lacking in 
the past, she said. "First Interstate has been drifting." 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific, on the other hand, just needs to follow through with plans 
started by previous managers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The two banks are completely different because of the strategies taken before 
today. That will have a big impact on where they go in the future," Berger 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The banks have been going in somewhat opposite directions nearly from the day 
they were started. First Interstate opened its doors as a multistate banking 
company, formed by the spinoff of Transamerica Corp.'s banking operations in 
1958. Security started out as a simple California-based bank. It expanded by 
buying dozens of smaller community banks, but didn't set foot outside of 
California until a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While First Interstate stretched its increasingly far-flung empire with a 
franchise program allowing banks in other states to use its name and some of 
its operations for a fee, Security began to diversify in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, Security had launched an aggressive program that took it into 
merchant banking and discount brokerage overseas, and it was constantly testing 
bank regulations that limited its expansion into non-banking activities. These 
operations helped steady Security's earnings when the traditional banking 
business was soft. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, First Interstate has been running into major problems with its 
geographic diversification. Since the late 1970s, the bank has suffered with 
loan problems at at least one of its out-of-state banks. First the bank was hit 
by problems in the Southwest, where the oil market suddenly foundered, leaving 
First Interstate's Rocky Mountain units with steep losses. Then, after a 
much-ballyhooed merger with Allied Bancshares of Texas, First Interstate began 
posting staggering losses in the Lone Star state. And now, the bank's Arizona 
operations are causing problems. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: Security Pacific posted record profits in 1989. First 
Interstate will be lucky to avoid posting a loss for the year when it reveals 
its 1989 earnings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Its past and projected losses -- and the beating they might deliver to the 
company's stock -- could make it virtually impossible for First Interstate to 
expand, and may force the bank to start another round of layoffs and cost cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Security, meanwhile, says its retrenching days are largely behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the successes we've had are transferable into other markets," said 
Smith. "We are also facing an environment where there is increasing competition 
both nationally and internationally. There's an argument to be made that says 
within this decade we will have to become a lot bigger to remain formidable."

HIGH FUEL COSTS SEND AMR PROFIT PLUNGING

<P>
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, said Wednesday that its 
fourth-quarter earnings took a nose dive, skidding 66.7% to $38.9 million, 
largely because of higher fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's dismal fourth quarter dragged down AMR's earnings for the year. 
</P>
<P>
AMR said 1989 profit fell 4.8% to $454.8 million, despite record profits for 
the first nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Crandall, AMR chairman and president, called the airline's 
performance very disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
AMR's shares closed down 50 cents at $56.50 Wednesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Other airline stocks were mixed. UAL Corp., parent of United 
Airlines, closed down 87.5 cents at $161, and USAir was off 12.5 cents at 
$30.75. Delta Air Lines gained 12.5 cents, closing at $66.375. 
</P>
<P>
Besides AMR, other airlines are also expected to post profit declines. Last 
week, for example, Delta warned investors that profits would be lower in its 
December quarter, largely because of skyrocketing fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Most airline analysts don't expect the first quarter of this year to be much 
better, despite recent fare increases to cover fuel costs. Some analysts expect 
the industry to lose $600 million for the first three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
AMR said fuel prices rose 30% during the fourth quarter, but fares remained 
steady, squeezing profits. So far this year, American has raised ticket prices 
4% and has announced a $6 surcharge on one-way tickets to cover fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lower profits, AMR said revenue grew significantly, thanks to 
expansions in the Eastern United States and in Europe. The airline's revenue 
gained by 9.3% to $2.59 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the year was 
up 18.8% to $10.48 billion. DENISE GELLENE

Geraldo Rivera confesses: "I have strayed." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera is here until Friday at the convention of the National Assn. of 
Television Program Executives, the annual marketplace for syndicated 
television, to tell potential buyers of his talk show what he says his viewers 
already know: that Rivera has changed his stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera -- the controversial talk show host who won the unofficial Purple Heart 
of tabloid TV last season by having his nose broken in an onstage fracas 
between a white supremacist and a black guest, who rose to unprecedented levels 
of infamy with an NBC prime-time special on satanic cults featuring detailed 
accounts of skinning human babies -- said in an interview Tuesday that he will 
forgo celebrating "deviant behavior and kinky sex" in favor of returning to his 
roots as an investigative reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"The changes have really been in place since Thanksgiving," said Geraldo, 
sipping a drink in the lobby bar of his hotel here. "I really came to a 
personal re-evaluation that I had strayed from my beaten path, strayed from the 
type of programs that made us a success for the past three years." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 47, said his viewers have already picked up on the new tone; at the 
NATPE convention, he hopes to persuade the program buyers that his change of 
heart is "long-term and sincere." 
</P>
<P>
Although the show already has been renewed for next season, a Rivera spokesman 
said that 25% of the 194 stations that carry it had lodged complaints about 
some of the content. And Rivera said that he and his executive producer, Marty 
Berman, had spent time at the convention luring back advertisers who had 
dropped out of "Geraldo" to avoid being associated with some of the subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"K mart came back two days ago; that deal is done," Rivera said. "We also got a 
major food company and a major, family-oriented fast-food chain." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to return to his roots, he related, came after an embarrassing 
Thanksgiving conversation with his son Gabriel, who said his friends were all 
repeating Geraldo jokes they'd heard from Johnny Carson and Jay Leno. "I've 
been the basic fodder for all the stand-up comedians for the past year or so," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I crossed the line into popular culture, there have been jokes -- 
but they used to be fairly benign. Now they're fairly nasty -- and not untrue, 
about some of the more deviant life styles we've portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera said that the jokes got worse right after the 1989 November "sweeps" 
ratings period, when his topics included "Debbie Duz Donuts," an installment on 
a topless doughnut shop in Colorado, and "Battered Lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
The competition made him do it, Rivera said. "I went too far. I think in 
November, I used up my quota on deviant behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up against Oprah (Winfrey) in 125 markets for the first time; it was the 
strongest competition in syndication history, and I overreacted. I made a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Another watershed point came last fall, when Rivera discovered that there 
weren't enough deviants to go around. He and Phil Donahue unwittingly booked 
the same deviant: a former Los Angeles police officer who had become a 
prostitute. Geraldo's topic: "Men Who Marry Prostitutes." Donahue's topic: 
"Prostitutes and Gigolos." 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassingly enough, both shows aired on the same day in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no normal people on any of the three shows ('Geraldo,' 'The Oprah 
Winfrey Show,' 'Donahue')," Rivera observed. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rivera said that the show's Nielsen ratings have remained the 
same since the show changed its tone, and are about the same this season as 
last. Rivera maintained that the changes grew less out of ratings anxiety than 
audience research, which, he said, indicated that viewers missed the old 
Geraldo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to become a male Oprah," he said, adding: "I'm out of the freak 
show business." 
</P>
<P>
But the competition still affects Rivera; he acknowledged that he wants to hold 
onto his viewers by being different from the pack. "Donahue is the inventor of 
the form, and Oprah has her 'Hey girlfriend, hey neighbor,' huggy-huggy stuff," 
he said. "People now have three nice alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
During February sweeps, he said, his topics will include "Busting Bad Doctors," 
"Mailroom Mayhem," "Black Soldiers" and "Dirty Divorces of the Rich and 
Famous." Other subjects in the works include college sports scandals and an 
investigation of child labor laws in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Do not expect to see "Girl Scouts Who Sell Cookies" on the next Geraldo, 
however. Despite NBC's frequent apologies for the Satanism show in October, 
1988, Rivera said his syndicated program will not shy away from similarly 
controversial topics in the future.

DANCE: THE FORMER 'PUNK PRINCESS' OF BALLET IS LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DANCE WITH 
MADONNA. WANNA-BE'S NEED NOT APPLY.

As she chats about her life and work between mouthfuls at a favorite downtown 
cafe one afternoon, Karole Armitage may seem the quintessential Bohemian 
enjoying a leisurely brunch. But this is, in fact, a rare moment of repose for 
Armitage, a working meal squeezed in before an afternoon of auditions for 
Madonna's spring concert tour, which Armitage will choreograph, and only a few 
hours before her departure for a four-month stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demise this past fall of her seven-member ballet troupe, the 
34-year-old dancer and choreographer has a bulging calendar. Besides 
choreographing Madonna's rock concert, she will be working on TV and film 
projects, performing and also teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Heartland meets SoHo would be one way to describe Armitage, a native of 
Lawrence, Kan., who has called New York City home for more than a decade. Her 
voice is heavy on Midwestern twang; in a style most antithetical to New York 
natives, she punctuates her pauses, with an engaging smile of a hot-pink 
painted mouth. The trademark bleached-blond fringe bangs (the rest of her hair 
cropped boyishly short) are a vestige of the punk era, yet Armitage manages to 
project a wholesome earnestness. 
</P>
<P>
Although her future projects are more commercial in nature, she maintains they 
represent a less marked departure from her previous work than might seem at 
first glance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always used street dancing in my work," she said. "What Madonna liked 
about it was the theatricality, the humor, the fact that it's not 
one-dimensional." 
</P>
<P>
Audiences at Armitage's ballets were just as likely to recognize the influence 
of Balanchine in her work as that of Smokey Robinson ("I think of them as 
equally great," she once said.) or Merce Cunningham, with whose modern dance 
company she performed in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Popular culture has always been a real nourishment for dance, Armitage said. 
"It's an old-fashioned idea to even separate high and low art any more." 
</P>
<P>
Although she will first begin to choreograph for the Madonna concert in earnest 
when the dancers have been selected, Armitage says that the steps will be 
composed of "real, real funk dancing -- with some wild moments, but also with 
some virtuoso stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, auditions for dancers, held in Los Angeles (and closed to the press) 
last week, were advertised as "Madonna World Tour 1990, Karole Armitage 
Choreographer, Open Audition for Fierce Male Dancers who know the meaning of 
Troop Style, Beat Boy and Vogue. Wimps and Wanna-Be's need not apply!" 
</P>
<P>
In her work with Madonna, Armitage says she has gone from working with a 
company of serious dancers to a single serious dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna was a dancer. That was her first interest," Armitage said. "That's 
what she originally came to New York to do. She's a sophisticated observer of 
dance, and a very good dancer." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Madonna tour, upcoming Armitage premieres include choreography for 
a feature film titled "Without You I'm Nothing" starring Sandra Bernhard, to be 
released later this year, a dance film for the BBC and a series of performances 
in Japan. In the planning stages are a film about Josephine Baker, for which 
Armitage would choreograph the dance scenes, and a possible collaboration with 
her live-in companion, artist David Salle, on a film about Pinocchio. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Armitage will teach and choreograph at the first of what is hoped 
will become an annual summer dance workshop in Crested Butte, Colo., where she 
recently bought a house. Part of the summer will also be spent at Cal State 
Humboldt in a dance residency with the systemwide Cal State Summer Arts 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
All of Armitage's projects promise to be a departure from her choreography for 
the stage, and, she hopes, a departure from her status as ballet bad girl as 
well. For years, Armitage tottered on the edge of respectability and financial 
solvency. 
</P>
<P>
Her ballets, which more often than not were performed in clubs because of a 
dearth of theater space, were always infused with elements of pop culture. 
Armitage was dubbed the "Punk Princess" of the ballet world. While her new-wave 
iconoclastic choreography and sleek-looking productions thrilled audiences, 
they often ruffled the dance establishment, and offended critics, leaving her 
with a checkered reputation as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
Her work seen at the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, "The Elizabethan Phrasing of 
the Late Albert Ayler," was pronounced by critic Martin Bernheimer as a "brash 
array of musical and scenic elements" with a "narrow range of kinetic ideas . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
But battling on the front lines of the New York dance scene is what Armitage 
has been doing lately and on this day, Armitage's fresh-faced manner is 
slightly tempered by a trace of weariness. 
</P>
<P>
"The dance world in New York is a place where there is so much struggle, and so 
little support for doing things that go against the established grain of what 
dance ought to be," Armitage said. 
</P>
<P>
The Armitage Ballet folded just as it seemed that the company might be on the 
verge of cementing its status in the New York dance world, she said, because 
its government funding wasn't renewed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to work about 12 hours a day, between fund-raising, working on 
choreography, and administration. I just decided if there was no help from the 
established dance world, then it was time to move on," Armitage said.

LUCAS DUE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN NEW EPISODE OF 'EWOK WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first shots in what local wags are referring to as "Ewok Wars" were fired 
at super-producer George Lucas this week in a Canadian federal courtroom where 
Lucas himself will take the stand today as one of the defendants in a 
$129-million copyright infringement case. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, his company Lucas Films Ltd. and 20th Century Fox Canada Ltd. have been 
accused by Calgary writer Dean Preston of stealing the idea for the furry 
outer-space creatures introduced to the world as Ewoks in Lucas' third "Star 
Wars" film, "Return of the Jedi," in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Preston testified Tuesday that he created Ewoks for "Space Pets," a script that 
he wrote in 1977 and mailed to Lucas at 20th Century Fox in 1978. Preston said 
"there are many striking similarities in 'Return of the Jedi' and my script. 
The most obvious is the Ewok and the name of the Ewok." Preston said he came up 
with the Ewok name while phonetically fiddling with the phrase "He walks." 
</P>
<P>
In depositions, Lucas has denied having ever seen Preston's script and during 
his testimony, Preston acknowledged that he cannot prove the script was even 
delivered to Lucas. After mailing "Space Pets," a children's adventure story 
about four space explorers who land on a planet populated by the creatures he 
called Ewoks, he said he never heard back from the either the studio or Lucas. 
Nor was the script returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Preston, who describes himself as a free-lance artist and 
personal manager for singers, testified that the descriptions of his creatures 
in "Space Pets" closely resemble the Ewoks as they appeared in "Return of the 
Jedi," and that in his script he created for them similar homes, weapons, 
traps, clothing, bikes and drums. 
</P>
<P>
David Frederick Hurry, a British Columbia writer, testified this week that he 
edited and enhanced "Space Pets" for Preston in 1978 before it was mailed to 
Lucas. In the "defense statement" given to the court, Lucas maintains that he 
created the Ewok as a small primitive version of the long-haired wookie that 
was introduced as Han Solo's sidekick in "Star Wars" in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Preston told the court that he did not think much about "Space Pets" and the 
fact that Lucas had not responded to it until 1982 when, during a trip to Los 
Angeles, he saw a small Japanese car on the road with a vanity plate that read 
"Ewok." He said he followed the car, and saw two small people, "either midgets 
or dwarfs," get out and learned from the driver that the two people were actors 
playing small characters known as Ewoks in George Lucas' next "Star Wars" 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a funny feeling in my stomach," Preston testified. "I knew after the 
conversation with the driver, my script had reached George Lucas. He had used 
my name, Ewok, even my creation." 
</P>
<P>
Preston said that when he returned to Calgary, he registered Ewok as a 
trademark in Canada. The trademark was later revoked due to his failure to 
financially exploit it. The "Space Pets" script was not copyrighted until last 
year, but in Canada, copyrights are automatic if authorship can be proved. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Preston's contentions have been supported by Hurry, by two of Hurry's 
family members and by a former West Virginia municipal court judge -- an 
associate of Preston's -- who testified that Preston had been talking about 
writing a space story since the late '60s and first described to him the furry 
creatures that resembled Lucas' Ewoks in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian attorney W. Graham Dutton, who is representing all three defendants in 
the trial, said Lucas would not have read Preston's script even if it had been 
sent to him. "George Lucas has never, ever examined unsolicited material such 
as this," Dutton said. 
</P>
<P>
Preston characterizes the case as another example of the little guy being 
ripped off and overmatched by a giant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a David-and-Goliath story," he quips. "It's not easy for someone like me 
to take on someone like George Lucas." 
</P>
<P>
Preston called the $129 million he is asking as "my fair share" of the billions 
of dollars that have been spent worldwide on the "Star Wars" series, 
merchandising and an Ewok TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
The non-jury trial is expected to last another seven days before Justice Andrew 
MacKay.

MOVIES: SCREENWRITER KEVIN JARRE RECALLS THE 'UNBELIEVABLE ODYSSEY' IN GETTING 
THE TALE OF A BLACK CIVIL WAR REGIMENT MADE.

<P>
The chain of circumstance by which a movie ultimately gets made can be a lively 
tale in itself. 
</P>
<P>
If the ballet entrepreneur Lincoln Kirstein had not grown up on Beacon Hill in 
Boston, if a young actor-screenwriter named Kevin Jarre had not been given some 
Civil War lead soldiers one childhood Christmas and had not learned to ride 
well during his growing-up days in Wyoming, and if the two men had not met at 
Mother Goldsmith's restaurant in Saratoga, N.Y., five summers ago, the 
much-honored film "Glory," about the historic black regiment, the 54th 
Massachusetts, might still be waiting to be made. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Jarre explained in an interview this week, Kirstein, a 
dyed-in-the-wool Bostonian, lived near the home of Robert Gould Shaw, the 
23-year-old Harvard graduate who formed the regiment and led it to glory. He 
knew Shaw's family and he loved the Augustus Saint-Gaudens statue honoring the 
regiment that was erected opposite the Statehouse in 1897 and paid for by 
public donations. Kirstein later wrote a monograph, "Lay This Laurel" (the 
title from an Emily Dickinson poem) about the regiment, and it became one of 
the sources for "Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Jarre, born in Michigan, had a well-traveled childhood, living for a time in 
Wyoming with a father he calls Hemingwayesque and who combined ranching and 
fashion photography. Later, living in Los Angeles, Jarre did extra work and bit 
parts in the TV series "Flipper," which starred Brian Kelly, to whom his 
actress mother was then married. She subsequently married composer Maurice 
Jarre, who adopted Kevin and whose name Kevin took. 
</P>
<P>
In England, where Jarre was scoring "Ryan's Daughter," Kevin became a friend of 
David Lean's. "What do you propose to do with your life?" Lean asked one 
afternoon. "Act," Jarre said tentatively. "No!" Lean roared, and explained why 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not flattering on the subject of actors," Jarre says. 
</P>
<P>
Lean counseled writing and directing as the only way to fly. Jarre is now a 
screenwriter (a first script of "Rambo II," two other scripts sold and shot and 
due out). In 1986, Jarre and another writer and the writer's dancer wife were 
in Saratoga for the summer season of the New York City Ballet. There Kirstein 
saw a snapshot of Jarre on horseback and was struck by the resemblance to an 
equestrian statue of Col. Shaw. The two men met at Mother Goldsmith's place and 
talked about the 54th. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the 54th," Jarre says. "I'd been a Civil War freak myself ever 
since I got some toy soldiers when I was a kid. Lincoln's interest was deeper. 
It related to his whole philosophy about surrendering yourself to something 
bigger, some larger cause. He'd always wanted to make a movie about the 54th." 
</P>
<P>
Jarre read everything he could find about Shaw and the 54th, including Shaw's 
letters, which have been published, and "The Journal of Charlotte Forten," who 
was the colonel's love interest but who is not represented in the film. "Then," 
Jarre says, "I moved into Room 421 at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York, 
opposite the Players Club, and wrote the script in four weeks, on spec. I never 
thought I could interest anybody in it. A Civil War epic, about black people? 
But I'd got really attached to the story. I had to kill everybody off and I'd 
end up in tears when I got through writing." 
</P>
<P>
Kirstein showed the script to Merchant Ivory Productions, but it was well 
beyond their scale. "They couldn't make head or tail of it." An agent sent it 
to director Bruce Beresford, who committed to do it and brought in producer 
Freddie Fields, who set up a deal at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
But then began what Jarre called "an unbelievable odyssey." The project was 
attacked within the studio and by at least one outside consultant, a University 
of Virginia black historian. It was called racist, partly, evidently, because 
Jarre is white and partly because the language is outspoken and the 
characterizations not invariably idealized. 
</P>
<P>
"The professor even denied some of the irrefutable facts about the regiment," 
Jarre says. "I was able to punch holes in his attack." But when David Puttnam 
jumped, fell or was pushed from Columbia, Beresford left the project and it was 
clearly dead at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
"But Freddie Fields took it to Tri-Star," which agreed to do it. Edward Zwick 
became the director. Jarre gives Fields high and grateful marks for assembling 
the production team, including cinematographer Freddie Francis, that did the 
film. (Jarre visited the production only briefly. "Once production starts, the 
last person anybody wants around is the writer," he says, although this is not 
as invariably true as it used to be.) 
</P>
<P>
The historical events, including the valiant, doomed attack on Ft. Wagner, 
S.C., which cost the lives of half the regiment, are all factual. (Faulty 
intelligence said the regiment outnumbered the fort's defenders by perhaps 
2-to-1. In fact, the defenders outnumbered the regiment by more like 3-to-1.) 
</P>
<P>
The principal black characters, played by Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and 
Andre Brougher, are fictional, although there are, Jarre says, trace elements 
of regimental blacks about whom something is known. The Brougher character was 
suggested by one of the two sons of Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist 
orator, both of whom fought with the 54th. 
</P>
<P>
"I met the great-grandnephew of the regiment's original flag bearer," says 
Jarre, "and that was a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early alarms that "Glory" might be seen as racist, the charges have 
not materialized and the film has been widely praised in the black community, 
and by most critics. 
</P>
<P>
Kirstein, Jarre says, admits to being pleased that "Glory" was made, but, Jarre 
adds, "He's not the type to say, 'Look what I wrought.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jarre has a small unbilled role in the film, as a white soldier who picks a 
fight with Denzel Washington and later, as the regiment heads for battle, 
yells, "Give 'em hell, 54th." 
</P>
<P>
Among Jarre's other credits are "The Tracker," a period Western he also wrote 
on speculation and which stars Kris Kristofferson and was directed by John 
Guillermin, and "Navy SEAL," starring Charlie Sheen and due out this summer. 
Producer Larry Gordon has acquired two other Jarre scripts: "Judgment Night" 
and "The Devil's Own," about an IRA man on the run in New York. He is working 
on another spec script, which he intends to direct, thus fulfilling David 
Lean's counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were talking during 'Ryan's Daughter,' I asked if he thought I ought 
to go to film school. He said no, I could learn all that in six months. I asked 
what I ought to do and he said, 'Read!' Then he gave me Boswell's 'Life of 
Johnson' and Alan Moorehead's 'The Blue Nile' and 'The White Nile.' Amazing."

The City Council has scheduled a meeting for Tuesday between city officials and 
representatives of Best Disposal Co. and its prospective buyer, National 
Environmental Waste Management Corp., to review terms of the planned takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside-based National would assume Best's contract to provide trash pickup 
services to the city. But a final date for the sale has not yet been set, 
because National is awaiting completion of an environmental report on Best's 
Monrovia site. The report is expected within a month.

FARMERS' MARKET POSSIBLE

<P>
The city may soon have a farmers' market, if downtown merchants agree to 
support the market financially. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved the concept of a market upon the 
recommendation of the Planning Commission and the Community Services 
Commission. A possible site might be the north side of Lime Avenue, west of 
Myrtle Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city will seek sponsors among members of the Downtown Monrovia Merchants 
Assn. to come up with the nearly $12,700 needed to cover publicity, insurance, 
licensing and management expenses for the first year. 
</P>

RV PARKING BAN REVIEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are deciding whether to push ahead with a planned ordinance to 
ban overnight parking for recreational vehicles, after a state attorney 
general's opinion last week that said cities have no right to enact such laws. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by resident complaints about traffic problems and the unsightliness of 
RVs on city streets, the West Covina City Council is considering an overnight 
parking ban for oversized vehicles, including RVs. 
</P>
<P>
A vote is planned for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But California cities do not have the authority to prohibit the parking of 
recreational vehicles on residential streets, according to the opinion by 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ronald Weiskopf. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina Administrative Analyst Dan Holler said the city attorney is 
reviewing the proposed ordinance to see how it might be affected.

POMONA ERRS WITH FEES FOR ANIMAL DISPOSALS

Pomona's dead dogs and cats will join its dead sofas and stoves in the streets 
and parks, now that the City Council has agreed to charging citizens fees to 
dispose of deceased pets and strays. 
</P>
<P>
The city's officials have their heads up and locked. 
</P>
<P>
The costs to take trash to the only disposal site in the Pomona Valley has to 
be part of the reason our streets and alleys are littered with castoffs. If the 
city fathers would only wake up to realize that fees directed at those using 
the services are a compelling force to violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
The real bottom line to negotiations with the Pomona Valley Humane Society is 
that the city will pay the $66,000 -- it claims it saved in clever bargaining 
-- in added street cleaning costs.

ELECTRIC POWER RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electric power was restored to the city's Police and Fire departments on 
Tuesday after a three-day outage. Rainwater from the weekend storm had leaked 
into an electrical panel in the basement of city offices last Saturday and 
contributed to an extensive internal power failure, City Manager John Bernardi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 30 minutes on Saturday night, calls to the city's 911 emergency 
phone number were automatically transferred to the San Marino Police 
Department, Bernardi said. The Fire Department used generators and the Police 
Department drew its power from extension cords connected to City Hall 
administrative offices next door. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really sure what happened at this point," Bernardi said, adding that 
the failure in the electrical system, installed when City Hall was built on 
Mission Street more than three years ago, is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
It took until Tuesday to make the repairs because crews were unable to obtain 
needed parts during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, Bernardi said.

SAN GABRIEL WILL CHANGE MAYOR EVERY 9 1/2 MONTHS

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members on Tuesday voted to rotate the mayor's job among 
themselves every 9 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-2 vote, the council abolished the current system, which provided for 
two-year terms for mayors elected by members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors were eligible to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system there will be no election for mayor. Instead, the council 
has adopted a rotation system in which each member will serve as mayor over a 
four-year period. The rotation system goes into effect after council elections 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem James Castaneda opposed the rotating mayor system. "We're making 
a change here without doing all the homework," Castaneda told the council. He 
suggested that the system should be changed to allow the voters, instead of the 
council, to elect a mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John Tapp, whose term expires in April, agreed. "I'd like to go to a 
system where the people do have a voice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Mary Cammarano said the new system, patterned after methods 
used by Alhambra and Monterey Park, is more fair than a two-year term for the 
mayor. "Everybody gets a chance to be mayor this way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the new rotation, Castaneda will become mayor on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the debate, Councilman Sabino Cici proposed that the change 
take place immediately, which would have allowed Castaneda a head start on his 
term. But Cici's motion died because of lack of support.

APPROVAL OF $50-MILLION PROJECT DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: PASADENA BOARD OF DIRECTORS WANTS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDING 
OF THE MARENGO BLOCK PLAN. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continued objections by the city's Endowment Advisory Commission have caused 
the Board of Directors to withhold approval, at least for a week, of the 
$50.5-million Marengo block development plan, a key element in the city's 
downtown Civic Center master plan. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with money questions Tuesday from the commission about the complicated 
project that took 1 1/2 years to devise, the board asked members of the city's 
planning staff and the Janss Corp., the project's Santa Monica-based developer, 
to meet immediately with commission members. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was directed to examine whether the city has a strong enough 
guarantee of repayment of a $2.9-million loan that is part of the development 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in favor of the project; we're not opposed to the project. We just don't 
like the financial arrangements," Leigh Rosenberg, chairman of the eight-member 
commission, said during Tuesday's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Director Chris Holden said he wants to hear alternatives to a controversial 
part of the project that calls for relocating and converting the out-of-date 
police building to low-income senior housing at a cost that could reach $6.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The board did not rule out discussion of other financial aspects when it meets 
again Tuesday to vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm open to new information," Director Rick Cole said, although he said the 
board should avoid rehashing the same issues already covered during three hours 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The project is proposed for a roughly triangular-shaped, four-acre piece of 
land between Holly and Walnut streets and between Marengo Street and the Santa 
Fe Railway tracks next to Memorial Park. The four-story, 59-year-old police 
building on the site would be relocated and the building converted to 44 units 
of senior housing. The Fire Department headquarters, fire station and emergency 
operations center on Marengo Street would be moved and the buildings 
demolished; 350 units of housing in nine separate buildings would be 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The development would include two levels of parking and 9,000 square feet of 
retail space. If the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approves a 
light-rail line through Pasadena, the site would also contain the city's major 
rail stop. 
</P>
<P>
The Endowment Advisory Commission's objections center on the city's financial 
share in the project and the high cost of converting the police building to 
senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
As now proposed, the Janss Corp. would give the city $6.9 million for the 
property -- $4 million in cash and a note for $2.9 million payable over 22 
years. The city would also receive a small share of any future profits should 
the corporation sell the project. Commission members believe the city should 
establish a partnership with Janss to retain city ownership of the land and 
garner a larger share of the profits from any future sale. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commission said that it believes the cost for the renovation 
of the police building -- which it estimates at $130,000 a unit -- is too high. 
</P>
<P>
Like the commission, board members on Tuesday expressed their overall 
satisfaction with the project but also voiced reservations about its financial 
arrangements. Director John Crowley asked for collateral for the $2.9-million 
loan, and Director Jess Hughston asked for information about the costs to the 
city of relocating the Fire Department structures.

for the high school portion of the Sunkist Invitational indoor track meet at 
4:30 p.m. Friday at L.A. Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mustang girls will still have a strong contingent in the prep portion 
of the meet that will include more than 800 athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way will be sprinter Deanna Knowles in the 50-yard dash, Akua 
Sutherland in the 50-yard hurdles and Rhonda Robinson in the 880-yard run. The 
meet will mark the high school debut of Knowles, a freshman who is already 
regarded among the top sprinters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
She is expected to run legs on both the 640-yard and mile relays. 
</P>
<P>
Muir also has the services of Inger Miller, considered the top sprinter in the 
nation. But Coach Jim Brownfield said Miller will be limited to participating 
in the relays at the Sunkist meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Inger has missed most of the team's informal preseason workouts since October 
due to her commitments to the Tournament of Roses as a rose princess," 
Brownfield said. "So in her best interest we feel it is safer to prevent a 
possible early-season injury by not subjecting her to compete in too many 
events." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs will also be represented in the boys division of the meet. Hassan 
McCullough will compete in the 880-yard run and Muir is also entered in the 
seeded 8 x 160 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the top individual performer from the San Gabriel Valley competing is 
Walnut's Juliana Yendork. Considered the top prep long jumper and triple jumper 
in the nation, she won the state title in both events last season. Yendork 
posted best marks of 20-9 in the long jump and 42-6 3/4 in the triple. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong participant in the jumping events is Billy Ivey of Nogales in 
the triple jump. He was among the top performers in the state last season. 
Kendrick Washington of Rowland will also compete in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
The valley will have several runners in distance events. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Castruita of West Covina is entered in the seeded mile and Bernice 
Santoyo of Mountain View, Wendy Griffith of Walnut and Laura Sansom of Glendora 
in the rated mile. Among the boys, Angel Martinez of San Gabriel will compete 
in the two-mile run and Bill Brannigan of Glendora and Ryan Polite of Walnut in 
the mile. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus College of Glendora has placed two football players on the California 
Community College Football Coaches Assn. All-State Team. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Steve Schell, a sophomore from Charter Oak High in Covina, was named 
to the first team and place-kicker Tim Gutierrez, a sophomore from Bonita of La 
Verne, made the second team. 
</P>
<P>
An honorable mention all-state performer last season, the 6-5 and 238-pound 
Schell finished his Citrus career with 59 receptions for 923 yards and four 
touchdowns and ranks second on the school's all-time list in catches. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, 5-8 and 180, made nine of 14 field-goal attempts and 26 of 28 
point-after tries for 53 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore defensive lineman Wes Clausen, sophomore quarterback Matt Ipsen and 
sophomore center Armando D'Avila received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Ipsen, a former Glendora High standout, completed 300 of 579 passes for 4,146 
yards and 30 touchdowns in his two seasons at Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team will attempt to keep its perfect 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. record when it visits Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo at 5:45 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, ranked No. 4 in the first NCAA Division II poll of the season, enters 
the game at 2-0 in the CCAA and 13-3 overall. San Luis Obispo is 1-1 in 
conference play and 6-9 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which has won or shared the conference title the last eight seasons, 
won its first two CCAA games by scores of 78-50 over Cal State Dominguez Hills 
and 80-68 over Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have been led by senior center Niki Bracken, who scored 33 points 
against Chapman and 21 against Dominguez Hills. Two other scoring leaders are 
forward Marcine Edmonds and reserve center Danielle Carter. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo lost to Cal State Northridge, 68-65, and defeated Cal State Los 
Angeles, 73-52, in its first two conference games last week.

ANGRY COUNCIL FIGHTS BACK AT PROPOSED ETHICS REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bristling at the implication that they may be corrupt, Los Angeles City Council 
members on Wednesday threw out the $1.5-million annual funding for a proposed 
ethics commission and began picking away at other provisions of a sweeping 
ethics reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the mayor said he used bad judgment, we are all tarred with being 
crooks," said Council President John Ferraro. "We have to prove our innocence 
before we're accepted, and I don't like that. I don't like that at all." 
</P>
<P>
The full council was confronting, for the first time, an ethics reform package 
whose seeds were planted a year ago when questions about Mayor Tom Bradley's 
financial dealings began to emerge publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley conceded that he used poor judgment in accepting paid positions with 
two area banks and appointed an ethics-in-government commission to draft a new 
standard of conduct for public officials. 
</P>
<P>
The far-ranging proposals of that commission, combined with the recommendations 
of a council committee, call for publicly financed political campaigns, 
restrictions on outside income for public officials, increased financial 
disclosure and a ban on lobbying by former officials for a year after they 
leave office. 
</P>
<P>
In a special session Wednesday, the council began attacking the package with a 
blizzard of amendments generally intended to weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most serious changes was an amendment that greatly softens a proposed 
ban on gifts and honorariums. The amendment, sponsored by Councilman Joel 
Wachs, bars only gifts and honorariums from people who do business with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it matters to anybody whether my cousin from Minneapolis sends 
my daughter a bat mitzvah gift," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who seconded 
the amendment. "My cousin from Minneapolis is actually regulated more strictly 
than Art Snyder" (the former councilman who is now a powerful lobbyist). 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Michael Woo, one of the drafters of the package, said the change 
"has the effect of gutting the entire proposal." Woo said he will attempt to 
repair the damage today. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members had been skittish about publicly criticizing ethics 
reforms, but a number spoke out bluntly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we subhuman? Are we less ethical than any other profession?" asked 
Councilman Hal Bernson, who declares Los Angeles "the cleanest city in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the only incident "that has even been remotely connected with any 
wrongdoing" has been the "alleged situation" regarding Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, we're stampeded into a situation where we're going to declare 
ourselves as not being thieves," Bernson said. "I am not a thief. . . . I'm not 
going to support a package that declares we're all dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
The council debate lasted into the evening and is to resume today. Council 
members and observers said it is impossible to tell what provisions will 
survive the amendment process. 
</P>
<P>
The council barely touched on the most controversial provision -- publicly 
financed campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that gives the council far greater control over the commission, the 
council voted to throw out the provision that automatically gives the new 
ethics commission $1.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who offered the amendment, said the original proposal gives the 
commission $1.5 million "whether they need it or not. . . . It is bad public 
policy to guarantee a level of funding to any department." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he could give the backers of the proposal -- including 
Geoffrey Cowan, chairman of Bradley's commission -- his personal guarantee that 
the commission would be adequately funded. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said Wednesday that council control over the budget "compromises" the 
independence of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Some provisions that we thought were important are not in the document as it's 
emerged today," Cowan said when the session ended. "Whether those are . . . 
fatal flaws is something we've got to give some thought to." 
</P>
<P>
The package before the council is a compromise worked out by Cowan and Woo, 
chairman of the council's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee. Cowan said last week that if 
the compromise emerges from the council substantially intact, there will be no 
citizens initiative on the June ballot that would encompass all the 
recommendations of Cowan's commission. 
</P>
<P>
In passing its own ethics reforms, the council is attempting to head off an 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief address to the council Wednesday, Bradley urged passage of the 
proposal without amendment.

U.S. TO SUE 15 FIRMS OVER POLLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS DESCRIBE THEIR NEW "OFFENSIVE" AS THE LARGEST EFFORT OF 
ITS KIND. THEY SAY THE CASE SIGNALS RENEWED SUPPORT FOR ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS BY 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>

<P>
Federal officials, in what they described as a new "offensive" in environmental 
protection, announced plans Wednesday to sue 15 industrial companies for 
allegedly polluting Southern California's coastal waters with cancer-causing 
toxins that have threatened marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency 
spearheading the action, described it as the largest effort of its kind and 
said the case signals renewed support for the environment by the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the accused companies are Westinghouse Electric Corp., Chris-Craft 
Industries and Benjamin Moore Paint Co. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 companies are suspected of having discharged either the pesticide DDT or 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into Los Angeles Harbor, onto the Palos Verdes 
Shelf off the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and at two sites in the San Pedro Channel 
north of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies, according to NOAA, dumped the contaminants as industrial 
byproducts directly into the ocean; others contributed to the problem by 
letting toxics pour into sewer systems that drain into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Campbell, NOAA's general counsel, said that his agency on Wednesday 
formally notified each of the companies that a lawsuit will be filed against 
them within 60 days. Such notice is required under environmental law. The 
lawsuit will demand that the firms first collectively fund a 
multimillion-dollar, comprehensive "damage assessment" study of the 
contamination and then pay to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line," Campbell said at a press conference in Los Angeles, "is that 
they're going to have to pay now or they can pay later." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the contamination, of which officials and marine biologists have long 
been aware, dates back to the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why NOAA had not undertaken such a lawsuit earlier, Campbell 
appeared to take an indirect swipe at the Reagan Administration, long a target 
of environmentalists who charged that it was lax in enforcing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a new political wind blowing," Campbell said. "Our mission is no 
longer to maintain the status quo, but to take the offensive, to improve the 
environment across the board." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said Wednesday that he had secured 
nearly $1 million in federal funding for NOAA to develop the case against the 
accused companies. The money, according to NOAA attorneys, will be reimbursed 
to the government by the accused companies should the agency win its case in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"This lawsuit should send a simple message to polluters: We mean business and 
we're coming after you," Levine said in a statement released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the lawsuit could net as much as $88 million for cleanup and 
restoration of the coastal region. 
</P>
<P>
NOAA officials declined to speculate on how much money could be recovered by 
suing the 15 companies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Superfund program, NOAA is entrusted with marine natural 
resources and can file claims against companies found responsible for toxic 
pollution. One such case, initiated in 1983 against a New Bedford, Mass., 
electronics firm accused of discharging PCBs into the Atlantic, is expected to 
begin in federal court next month. 
</P>
<P>
A prime source of toxic contamination in regional waters, NOAA has alleged, is 
the Montrose Chemical Corp., a Delaware-based company that produced more DDT 
than any other company in America. Montrose ceased operations at its Los 
Angeles plant in 1982 after 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
The company, according to federal officials, dumped acid wastes and DDT-laden 
sludge directly into San Pedro Channel, disposed of them in area landfills and 
discharged them at county waste-water treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies similarly accused by NOAA of contaminating coastal waters with 
DDT include Chris-Craft Industries; Stauffer Chemical Co. and Stauffer 
Management, and chemical manufacturers ICI Inc., ICI Americas and ICI American 
Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Those accused of polluting the ocean with PCBs include Benjamin Moore; Simpson 
Paper Co., Apex Drum Co. Inc., Ted Levine Drum Co., Myers Drum Co., Potlach 
Corp., and Trans Harbor Services. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as a polluter of PCBs was a Westinghouse plant in Compton that 
repairs electrical transformers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about this," said plant manager Jordon Weinstock on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from several other of the accused companies were similarly puzzled by 
NOAA's allegations. Many said they were unaware of the action until they were 
contacted by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
NOAA officials said its assessment of damage to aquatic life and coastal waters 
-- expected to take two years -- will also involve the Interior Department and 
various California agencies. Birds, marine mammals and fish will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists hailed NOAA's announcement as a substantive step toward 
cleaning up the ocean off Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are thrilled that they're interested," said James Thorton, a senior 
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles. "If (NOAA) 
plays a tough game, it could really make a difference."

MAN TOSSED ACID TO GET HIS DAY IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ATTACKER WANTED TO AIR COMPLAINTS ABOUT MEDICAL TREATMENT OF WIFE. HE 
TOLD NEIGHBORS, WHO WARNED POLICE, OF HIS PLANS TO ATTACK DOCTOR.

<P>
Arthur Waters had carried a grudge for years. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Mildred, had been driven to psychosis and suicide by psychiatrists, 
he claimed. To prove his point, he compiled an exhaustive journal, recording 
nearly every pill his wife took and her reaction. 
</P>
<P>
He would show the world that his wife shot herself to death last year because 
of improper treatment, the 74-year-old Pacific Palisades man told neighbors in 
the apartment building he managed. 
</P>
<P>
Waters had urged legal authorities and the news media to review the reams of 
information he had. But when they declined to launch investigations, neighbors 
said, Waters hatched a desperate plan: He would attack the doctors who treated 
his wife, and he would not be ignored anymore. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, just after noon, Waters went to the Santa Monica office of Dr. 
George Seeds, one of his wife's former psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a .25-caliber pistol, a rope and a plastic bottle filled with 
muriatic acid, he tied up the 60-year-old psychiatrist, then doused him with 
the acid, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing struggle between the two men, Waters fell dead. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Seeds was acting in self-defense. But they were not 
certain if the psychiatrist strangled Waters or the elderly man died of sudden, 
natural causes. An autopsy is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds was in fair condition Wednesday in a Torrance hospital, where he is being 
treated for second- and third-degree burns on his face and body. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors in the apartment building on Sunset Boulevard were stunned to learn 
Waters had finally acted on his threats. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the building manager had told neighbors he was frustrated, because 
no one would listen to the story of his wife's illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
He had called everyone from the district attorney's office to newspapers and 
such television programs as "60 Minutes," "20/20" and "Donahue" in hopes of 
finding an ear for his story of how several doctors allegedly provided improper 
medication for his wife, one neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
He became obsessed with the case after his wife killed herself in the couple's 
apartment last April 24, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
When the media and others failed to take interest, Waters told neighbors that 
he planned to attack those whom he blamed for his wife's worsening psychosis 
and death, said neighbor Robin Jesseman. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically, 'I'm going to pay these guys back,' " Jesseman said. "He 
promised he wasn't going to kill anyone. He told me he was going to shoot them 
in the legs and cripple them." 
</P>
<P>
Waters blamed four unnamed doctors for his wife's deteriorating condition, said 
Jesseman and another neighbor, Gayle Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the psychiatrists only by number -- "Dr. No. 1 and Dr. No. 2" -- 
the women said. 
</P>
<P>
"His intent was to go after all of them. But he thought he was going to get 
caught after the first one," Lockwood said. "He had talked about it, really, 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Waters told them that, at his trial, the doctors' mistakes 
"would all come out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
Waters went on his crusade despite the fact that he had settled a malpractice 
lawsuit against Seeds in 1987 for $75,000, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds was not sanctioned in that case, or any other, and is in good standing 
with the Medical Board of California, according to a spokeswoman for the state 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Waters told Lockwood and Jesseman last month that he wanted to carry out his 
revenge plan before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
But he was delayed, for a time, when he contacted an unnamed reporter, or 
investigator, whom he thought might take up his cause, the women said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Waters gave away many of his belongings and, on Saturday, 
he moved out of the apartment building he had managed for 11 years and checked 
into a Santa Monica motel, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Waters had filled three briefcases with identical sets of "evidence," leaving 
one with Jesseman, one with the building's owner and keeping one for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Jesseman said Waters gave her the giant black briefcase about a month ago, 
telling her to release it to the media after he went to jail. 
</P>
<P>
The briefcase contains -- in dizzying detail -- a chronicle of Mildred Waters' 
medical history, including daily logs kept by her husband, dating back to 1984, 
that noted medication his wife had taken and her behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The briefcase also held four boxes of documents, ranging from annotated 
depositions in the lawsuit to correspondence with the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully labeled audio tapes in the briefcase suggest Waters taped his phone 
calls, some of them purportedly with his wife's doctors. 
</P>
<P>
He had also written a 65-page essay -- entitled "Lowest Lows in the Medical and 
Legal Professions" -- criticizing his wife's treatment, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesseman and Lockwood said they called Los Angeles police and several suicide 
hot lines last month to warn them about Waters' statements to them. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities told them they could not do anything -- unless Waters named his 
victims, or acted on his threats. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Doug Abney of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Los Angeles 
Division said the department would be able to locate a record of the phone call 
only after extensive checking. He said officers probably would not have acted 
on the call if they did not know who the targets of the threats were. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt helpless. There was nothing we could have done," Jesseman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried. We really tried. We were in a panic." 
</P>
<P>
Waters' lawsuit blamed his wife's worsening psychosis and involuntary muscle 
twitches on excessive dosages of psychotropic drugs. But Seeds' lawyer, Erica 
Snyder, said the doctor's prescriptions were proper. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experts said that the use of the drug was completely within the standard 
of care," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said Seeds settled the case to avoid a costly court trial. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the settlement, Waters continued to write letters to St. John's 
Hospital in Santa Monica, where Seeds is on the staff, complaining about his 
wife's treatment, Talbot said. Seeds felt the letters were threatening, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said that, shortly after the settlement, she received a telephone call 
from a psychologist, who said he was treating Arthur and Mildred Waters. 
</P>
<P>
The therapist told the attorney that Arthur Waters had threatened to kill 
Snyder, because he said the lawyer was trying to steal his settlement money, 
Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
"The check had already been issued," Snyder said Wednesday. "It was crazy. It 
had all been settled and done." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said she had forgotten about the case, and the threats, until a reporter 
called Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' lawyer, Bruce A. Friedman, could not be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Waters' obsession with his wife's case belied a normally gentle 
man who dutifully performed his chores around the building that overlooks Santa 
Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good, good man," said Genevieve Lipton, building owner. "He was a 
kind, honest man." 
</P>
<P>
Waters was born in Iowa and worked as a contractor before taking the apartment 
manager's job, Lipton said.

COUPLE SUSPECTED OF PLANNING FATAL ROBBERY ARRESTED 
</P>

<P>
A man and a woman suspected of masterminding an armored car robbery in East Los 
Angeles have been arrested, but the two gunmen who pulled off the heist and 
shot a courier to death remained at large Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Salas, 29, a guard for the Federal Armored Express company, was slain 
as he made a pick-up Tuesday at a crowded Department of Motor Vehicles office 
on Mission Drive. It was the sixth holdup of an armored car courier in the Los 
Angeles area in the last year, and it prompted the DMV to seek added security 
for its Los Angeles offices. 
</P>
<P>
Using attack dogs and helicopters, police scoured the neighborhoods surrounding 
the DMV office after the shooting. A red 1982 Toyota Celica that police said 
the gunmen had fled in was found about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The car was registered to an apartment address in the 1700 block of Cherokee 
Avenue in Hollywood. Late Tuesday, detectives armed with search warrants went 
to the apartment and arrested Mirna Guerra, 19, and Oscar Mendoza, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Both are from El Salvador and were booked on suspicion of conspiracy to commit 
murder, police spokesmen said. They were being held in jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Another man arrested with the pair at the apartment was booked on an unrelated 
misdemeanor warrant. He was identified as Gil Sanchez, 19. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe they (Guerra and Mendoza) were involved in the planning of the 
robbery," Lt. Fred Nixon said. The LAPD spokesman would not elaborate but added 
that the actual triggerman and an accomplice were still being sought. 
</P>
<P>
In a house-to-house search of the area surrounding the DMV office, police also 
found a discarded duffel bag containing more than $10,000 stolen in the holdup, 
as well as guns and clothing allegedly used by the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Salas, the slain courier, had arrived at the DMV office shortly before 1 p.m. 
Tuesday, entered the vault area, dropped off one bag and picked up another 
containing receipts, checks and cash. 
</P>
<P>
His partner had remained inside the armored car, in accordance with company 
policy. As Salas neared the exit, two men -- one with a pistol drawn -- 
approached him from behind. The gunman shot Salas in the back and head, and he 
was pronounced dead on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV office was reopened Wednesday but eight employees -- among an estimated 
50 to 60 employees and customers who witnessed the shooting -- said they were 
too distraught to work and were given the day off, DMV spokesman Bill Gengler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The events of yesterday got to them," he said. "They were very emotionally 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DMV has asked State Police to post additional guards and take 
other security measures at several of its offices in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said the added security will be a temporary measure. 
</P>
<P>
Although State Police officers are frequently posted at DMV installations, none 
was assigned to the Mission Road office on Tuesday. An armed investigator with 
security and other duties was present however, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the flurry of armored car robberies, police said they have not been 
able to link the DMV holdup to the earlier crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to show there's a connection," Nixon said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS IN MURDER TRIAL TOLD TO KEEP 
DELIBERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors in the trial of a West Los Angeles gynecologist accused of strangling 
and dismembering his 11-year-old son were ordered Wednesday to begin 
deliberations anew after a Pomona Superior Court judge excused one of them 
without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The jury had deliberated 10 days already in the case of Khalid Parwez, 40, who 
allegedly butchered his son Raheel on Nov. 17, 1987, and left the pieces in the 
trash bin of a Hacienda Heights apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
The jury forewoman had complained to Judge Gregory C. O'Brien Jr. that two 
jurors were having difficulty following instructions. On Tuesday she reported 
the panel was hopelessly deadlocked, 10 to 1, with one undecided. She did not 
say how the vote was split. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing several jurors Wednesday, O'Brien excused one and ordered 
the jury to begin deliberations Tuesday with an alternate.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SIGNS MARK POLICE ANTI-DRUG BARRICADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police barricaded a second Sepulveda neighborhood Wednesday and posted signs 
saying "Secure Area" instead of "Narcotics Enforcement Zone. 
</P>
<P>
But the purpose of the roadblocks remained the same as in November when police 
put up the "Narcotics Enforcement Zone" signs in the nearby Columbus Avenue 
area -- to keep drive-by drug buyers off residential streets, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks now surround two nearby neighborhoods that are separated by 
Sepulveda Boulevard, which remains a through street. The area has long been 
known as a violent drive-by drug market, said Capt. Mark D. Stevens of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
The wording of the signs in both neighborhoods was changed after landlords said 
they were worried that prospective tenants would shun apartments in areas 
labeled as drug zones, said Greg Nelson, press deputy to Councilman Joel Wachs, 
who represents the area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 10, IS WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year-old Pasadena girl sleeping next to her mother was wounded in the 
thigh when a shower of bullets pierced the walls of their home during a 
drive-by shooting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday in the 600 block of N. Carmelo Ave. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 shots were fired from three weapons wielded by several suspects in a 
car, Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey said. 
</P>
<P>
One bullet struck the child's left leg and broke her thigh bone, Yancey said. 
She was taken to St. Luke's Medical Center, where she was reported in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the shooting is gang related because a relative of the injured 
girl is a gang member and had recently lived at the house, Yancey said. But he 
declined to provide the child's name or further information.

ABC GETS CFA RIGHTS FOR 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning with the 1991 season, all non-cable college football telecasts will 
be limited to one network. 
</P>
<P>
That is the essence of an agreement between ABC and the College Football Assn. 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No terms were announced, but industry sources said it is a five-year, 
$210-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
From ABC's point of view, it shows the network is still in the sports business. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, over the last six years, has been shut out during negotiations for other 
sports rights deals -- major league baseball, three different Olympics, the 
NBA, and the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, once dominant in televised sports, had not acquired a major sports 
property since Jan. 24, 1984, when it got the rights to the 1988 Winter 
Olympics for $309 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now CBS and NBC have been shut out of college football, except for bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
From the viewer's point of view, there will be fewer games to choose from on 
college football Saturdays after next season, although the smorgasbord on cable 
television will remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which had held the rights to CFA games, had exclusive negotiating rights. 
But CBS was not prepared to meet the CFA's asking price of more than $40 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, a source said, offered about $32 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will pay about $16 million in rights fees next season, the final year of 
its current four-year deal with the CFA. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not prepared to triple the rights fee, which was the price requested 
by the CFA and apparently agreed to by ABC," Neal Pilson, president of CBS 
Sports, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's bid, the source said, was a little lower than CBS' offer. 
</P>
<P>
ABC last fall signed contract extensions with the Pacific 10 and Big Ten 
conferences that run through the 1996 season, one more than ABC's new contract 
with the CFA. 
</P>
<P>
So the Pac-10 and Big Ten are unable to offer their games to another network, 
thus resulting in a logjam of games on one network. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA consists of 64 Division I-A college football schools. They include the 
members of the Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, Big Eight, Southwest and Western 
Athletic conferences, plus 20 independents, among them Miami, Notre Dame and 
Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Solomon, an ABC senior vice president, said: "There's one network that 
will be covering it all. We think the opportunity for putting together all of 
college football is a wonderful broadcasting opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon said that ABC plans to televise 50-55 college football games over the 
15-week season, but most of those will be shown regionally. 
</P>
<P>
During 10 of those 15 weeks, there will be an overlap between the ABC's 
Pac-10/Big Ten package and the CFA package. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, West Coast viewers will get to see only a few of ABC's CFA telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got an exact breakdown (on how things will work)," Solomon said. 
"There will be some flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon also said there will be some doubleheader dates. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, on most Saturdays, will have to leave the 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. time 
slots alone because of various conference packages. The Pac-10 package is 
carried by Prime Ticket in Los Angeles, and those games are usually televised 
at 3:30. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Ten may be able to sell a 9:30 a.m. package to a Los Angeles outlet, 
but the top games will belong to ABC and may not be shown here at all. 
</P>
<P>
All of college football was included in one TV package sold by the NCAA until 
June, 1984, when the Supreme Court voided it as a violation of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if things would be similar to the way they were before 1984, Solomon 
said, "The difference now is you have all the cable packages." 
</P>
<P>
The CFA already has a separate cable contract with ESPN, which is for $110 
million over four years, 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
As for the new deal with ABC, David Ogrean, assistant executive director of the 
CFA, said: "This was clearly the best deal for a variety of reasons. There's no 
getting around that, in this marketplace, the bottom line is money."

MCNALL OPENS DISCUSSIONS FOR TRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than twenty-four hours after he promised changes would be made on his 
beleaguered hockey club, owner Bruce McNall of the Kings has started working on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Talks have begun anew, according to one source close to the Kings, on a deal 
that would send left winger Luc Robitaille and defenseman Steve Duchesne to the 
Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Paul Coffey, a former teammate of Wayne 
Gretzky at Edmonton. Those talks are expected to intensify over the weekend at 
Pittsburgh, site of the NHL All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is shipping Robitaille to the Montreal Canadiens. The names 
mentioned in that deal are goalie Brian Hayward and center Brian Skrudland. 
</P>
<P>
The other King who keeps surfacing in trade rumors is center Bernie Nicholls. 
One possibility is a three-way trade involving the Oilers and the New York 
Rangers with either Edmonton right winger Jari Kurri or New York defenseman 
Brian Leetch becoming a King. 
</P>
<P>
An Edmonton source discounted a trade that would send Kurri to Los Angeles, 
saying there is no way the Oilers would allow Kurri, currently playing out his 
option, to be reunited with Gretzky in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Rogie Vachon downplayed the Robitaille rumor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how popular I am with the other general managers when things go 
bad," he said. "We're listening. People have called all day, and we're studying 
the offers. Some are good and some are bad." 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this season Luc seemed to be on the block, but those (Robitaille and 
Bernie Nicholls) are the names you hear when we're not doing well. If we're 
going to make a trade, we certainly have the ammunition. Sometimes you need to 
change the chemistry and sometimes you don't and the problem solves itself, but 
a decision should be coming pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
After the Kings lost to the Buffalo Sabres, 4-2, Tuesday night, their second 
consecutive loss and sixth in their last seven games, McNall told reporters he 
had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The party's over. . . . I've about had it," he said. "We are going to make 
some moves and they won't be small. I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille and Nicholls are the most marketable Kings. Gretzky is untouchable. 
Nicholls, coming off a 70-goal, 150-point season, has 27 goals and 45 assists 
but has slumped recently. Robitaille has 33 goals and 31 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls avoided reporters after practice. Robitaille and Duchesne could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give anything away," McNall said. "We have to look at what 
we need. But this is not fair to the fans to have to see this nonsense. Either 
the players will decide to perform or they'll perform somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm becoming the George Steinbrenner of hockey. I'm more like a fan. I tend to 
react the way they do. . . . So if they are not happy, I guess my job is to do 
what a fan would do." 
</P>
<P>
McNall's outburst Tuesday wasn't the first that King players had heard of his 
displeasure. On Monday, in the midst of a team practice, Vachon told the team 
that if anybody wanted out of L.A., management was in the mood to oblige. Coach 
Tom Webster later met one-on-one with the players. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about McNall's remarks Wednesday, Kelly Hrudey replied: "What do you 
expect him to say? He's got $50 million invested in the team. How would you be? 
Maybe this will fire some guys up. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's worried about being traded now. When people start questioning 
themselves, they get out of their roles. We all have to work together, and then 
we can all stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't have any problem with McNall's comments, either. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not winning, you need a shake-up," Gretzky said. "Whether anything 
is done or not done, it needed to be said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a question of talent. I think it's a matter of work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Does Gretzky feel an obligation to step forward? 
</P>
<P>
"I come to work and do my best," he said. "That's all I can do. It's 
everybody's responsibility to lead. We need a big game out of somebody to turn 
this around. I understand I have the responsibility to try to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' defense has been criticized of late, giving up 33 goals during the 
last seven games. But the offense has had problems, too. Tuesday night, the 
Kings outshot Buffalo, 35-22, in a losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
Time for a change? 
</P>
<P>
"You may have the most beautiful horse in the world, but if he doesn't win on 
the race track, why keep him?" Larry Robinson said. "You might as well have a 
mule if he wins. They all eat the same. 
</P>
<P>
"(McNall) has gone out on a limb. He has done a lot for a lot of guys. He stuck 
his neck out and we let him down."

JIM MURRAY: EXPECT THIS RISING STAR TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE

Usually, when a golfer no one ever heard of jumps into a lead in a tournament, 
the golf Establishment holds its head and groans: "Oh, no! Not another mystery 
guest! Not another boost to the senior tour. Why are they doing this to us?" 
</P>
<P>
They turn in irritation to the marquee names of the tour. "For God's sake! Go, 
get that guy!" they urge. 
</P>
<P>
But when young Robert Gamez vaulted to a runaway lead in the final round of the 
Tucson Open last week, there wasn't a teeth-gnashing or a muffled cursing in 
the house. Nobody silently rooted for him to shoot a whole bunch of double 
bogeys, knock it out of bounds, hit it in the water or misread a flock of 
seven-foot putts. Arnold Palmer never had a more adoring gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Robert (Don't call me Bob) Gamez is the most exciting thing to happen to the 
tour since the young Seve Ballesteros. When he won, hats flew into the air, TV 
ratings climbed, drinks were hoisted in the clubhouse and the story moved on 
the A wire. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gamez is not your basic blond, white-sweatered, blue-eyed young swinger 
out of Brigham Young or Wake Forest. Robert didn't exactly come out of the 
caddie shack, but Dad wasn't a pro, either. Dad was a custodial employee at a 
casino in Las Vegas, and Robert learned his golf the same way the young Ben 
Hogan did, teeing off a muni track by dawn's early light, putting by 
flashlight, playing anywhere he could with any set of clubs he could put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
He had a club in his hands at the age of 2, he was shooting par when he was 8 
and he was good enough to get a full scholarship to the University of Arizona 
by the time he was 16. He had an ideal build for a game that puts a premium on 
being close to the ball, and he had the best temperament since the young Gene 
Littler. 
</P>
<P>
Kids usually walk into the game with a swing so loose and whippy it goes around 
twice before impact, and they sport a hot-headed approach to the game that 
requires club-throwing, ball-washer-kicking and on-the-green cussing that would 
do justice to a Teamster in a traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
Robert was as cheerful as sunrise, as approachable as a guy selling hot 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
Word of his prowess spread before he even showed up for the pros. He shot a 63 
in an NCAA tournament, he won the Porter Cup, he was on the Walker Cup team and 
he was a quarterfinalist in the U.S. Amateur. He was a semi-star before he ever 
went to the pro qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of no one, he passed there and, even though his 42nd finish was 
not Palmerian, it should be remembered that is the tournament that holds forth 
the keys of the kingdom of heaven for the young player, the most important 
tournament, probably, most of them will ever play. 
</P>
<P>
Legend will have it that Robert won the first pro tournament he ever entered, 
but this will not be so. He had played in a Southern Open, a Texas Open and a 
B.C. Open (making one cut) before he teed it up at Tucson last week. 
</P>
<P>
But his play in the Tucson Open focused the attention of all golf. It was a 
tournament in which one player, David Frost, shot a 60; three others shot 64 
and almost everybody shot 65. One guy shot a 62 and finished 47th, and par 
missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Gamez walked through this hail of eagles and birdies like a monk telling beads. 
</P>
<P>
"He acted like a guy who's been out here 10 years," runner-up Jay Haas told the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows what comes next for the tour phenom. The pressure is subtle -- 
but persistent. 
</P>
<P>
It begins with the older players coming around on the practice tee, watching 
silently for a few minutes, then asking innocently, "Have you always had that 
left hand so far over on the shaft, kid?" They wonder if he's bending his left 
knee too much, if his take-away is too abrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, they assure interviewers, "He'll never hold up with that grip -- 
it's gotta cost him sooner or later." His swing, they will find, is too upright 
-- or too flat. They will wonder if he keeps his head still enough over the 
putts. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gamez knows all this. It is an established pattern in golf. The new 
young rising star comes out of the chute, dazzles the tour. Then, suddenly, he 
hits the wall of pain three to four years out. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to steel yourself not to listen," he says. "You go back to your 
own teacher." 
</P>
<P>
You don't fix what ain't broke. You stay with what brung you there. 
</P>
<P>
The swing is not Snead's, the grip not Harry Vardon's. But Robert's goal is not 
four 60s, it's consistency. Every shot isn't for the ages. It's for the green. 
</P>
<P>
When you win a tournament at the age of 21, would-be instructors aren't the 
only ones ringing your phone. Money managers, press agents, business agents all 
flock to the scene. Mark McCormack's secretary calls. Corporate outings are in 
the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Robert isn't listening to them, either. He feels he has 20 years yet to cash 
in. But, he's already finding that celebrity is not without its price. 
Microphones are thrust in his face as he walks off a tee down here in the Bob 
Hope Chrysler Classic. He has gone from "Robert Who?" to "Which one's Gamez?" 
</P>
<P>
He handles it better than anyone since the young Palmer. See him now as he pars 
his way around Morningside in the Howard Cosell Day With the All-Americans 
tournament. A pest approaches. He wants to know if he should buy some new 
titanium shafts. He acts as if golfer Gamez was a clerk in a sporting goods 
store, not a golfer in contention. 
</P>
<P>
The pest all but talks on his backswing. He is persistent, ubiquitous, 
oblivious to the fact Gamez is playing in a tournament. Gamez is patient, 
tolerant, all but excusing himself apologetically to make a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The round is not the U.S. Open. So Robert puts up with the intrusion. He comes 
up to a long par 4. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the shot?" he asks his 18-year-old caddie, his brother, Randy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 176 yards to the front of the green," Randy tells him. 
</P>
<P>
"Six-iron," Robert says. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be afraid to hit it," Randy tells him. 
</P>
<P>
How does it feel to go from a nobody to a magazine cover overnight? Robert 
grins. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the attention," he admits. "We're showmen out here. Distractions 
are part of the price. We're doing something we like. Nothing's free." 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling golf has got itself a lasting hero here. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw," grumble the old-timers, "he doesn't know how tough a game this is yet." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. And maybe golf doesn't know how tough a Gamez this is, either.

RON HARPER OUT FOR THE SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: LEADING SCORER'S KNEE INJURY MIGHT BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE ONE THAT 
SIDELINED MANNING FOR 11 MONTHS. 
</P>

Misfortune, by now familiar enough to the Clippers to be on a first-name basis, 
came calling again Wednesday when test results showed that Ron Harper, the 
team's leading scorer and a major reason for the transformation from perennial 
losers into playoff contenders, will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harper hurt his right knee during Tuesday's game against the Charlotte Hornets 
at the Sports Arena, collapsing after catching a pass from teammate Gary Grant 
under the basket. Harper stayed on the floor for a few moments, clutching the 
knee, then got up and walked to the locker room. The preliminary diagnosis was 
a sprain, and the scene was reminiscent of Danny Manning walking off the court 
at Milwaukee last January and going from a hyper-extended knee to surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Manning underwent reconstructive surgery on the right knee and was unable to 
return until 11 months later, after this season had begun. 
</P>
<P>
But Harper's injury may be even worse than Manning's. Harper tore the anterior 
cruciate ligament, as did Manning, but the fourth-year guard also has torn 
cartilage, according to team physician Tony Daly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disbelief," Coach Don Casey said. "I've been in this game for 25 or 30 
years and had never been associated with that injury. Then to have it happen 
twice, back to back?" 
</P>
<P>
No determination was immediately made as to when Harper would have surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who turns 26 Saturday, averaged 23 points and 39.5 minutes, both team 
highs, as well as 5.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.39 steals, since coming to 
the Clippers Nov. 16 as part of the deal that sent Reggie Williams and the 
rights to Danny Ferry to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Harper had five games of 30 
points or more, including 33 in the victory over Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
Players and coaches left Tuesday night, hopeful that the postgame diagnosis 
would hold true. They were buoyed by the fact that Harper said he felt good 
enough to return to the game. He probably would have, had it not been for the 
pop he reported hearing upon impact with the floor. That sound was enough for 
Daly to hold him out. 
</P>
<P>
Players spoke of shock when they arrived at the Sports Arena Wednesday for a 
light practice in preparation for tonight's game against the Seattle 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
"The void will be felt," Casey said. "But these players are the type who will 
recover. We have to. We have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Said center Benoit Benjamin, the team's most experienced player: "Life's a 
funny game. Things like that happen. It just so happens it's to this 
organization. Maybe it is a test." 
</P>
<P>
Passing this one will take a unique cram session. The new starting lineup has 
the rest of the grade-A players, but it also has one guard. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning tonight, the starters will be Grant and Ken Norman at guard, Manning 
and Charles Smith at forward, and Benjamin at center. 
</P>
<P>
The switch, of course, is Norman moving from forward. Has he ever played 
shooting guard? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," the 6-foot-8, 219-pounder said. 
</P>
<P>
When? 
</P>
<P>
"Today in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Also, with Tom Garrick questionable because of a bruised knee, the first guard 
off the bench figures to be rookie Jeff Martin. Michael Young, formerly 
Norman's backup at small forward, will get some time at guard, where he played 
for three years in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be an adjustment for me at all, especially in the 
transition game," Norman said. "Defensively, I think I can check anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Harper's scoring, though, was his defense. He blocked more shots than 
any guard in the league last season, and more than eight starting centers. And 
there was his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed," General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "We're still trying 
to make the playoffs and we're still trying to win every game we can. But it's 
hard to put into words. The person himself, aside from the basketball talent, 
brought great charisma that all the other players picked up on. That's one of 
the intangible things we're going to miss." 
</P>
<P>
The marketing department will also miss him. Since starting a new publicity 
campaign, which centered on Harper, the team sold 403 season tickets in the 
first 16 days of January. That's about one-third of the total number of new 
clients during the five-month off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we feel bad for Ron and the team because things were really 
jelling," Norman said. "But the people I feel the most sympathy for are Elgin 
and the owner (Donald T. Sterling). We had really established ourselves as a 
playoff team. I missed a bunch of games (with a strained groin), I come back, 
and now Ron. That's the type of thing that will drive people crazy." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, the Clippers weren't interested in the ghosts of bad 
luck past, or present. They said they were more concerned with continuing on 
the course Harper helped set. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give it to you in a nutshell," said Smith, now the Clippers' leading 
scorer among active players at 18.9 points a game. "I'm disappointed for Ron, 
I'm disappointed for the team. But we have to continue to play. We're all right 
and we have got to move forward. We've got a game tomorrow."

INJURY TO A KEY PLAYER AGAIN LETS AIR OUT OF CLIPPER SAILS 
</P>

<P>
The season-ending knee injury to Ron Harper is only the latest setback the 
Clippers have had with key players. Snakebitten is a word mentioned more than 
once in the past, and Wednesday's announcement just as the Clippers were in 
their best run in years won't do anything to deter such continued talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in curses or jinxes, but this is the closest thing to it," 
said Coach Don Casey, who has spent six years in the organization, some of that 
time when the team was in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other memorable lowlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- TERRY CUMMINGS. En route to being named rookie of the year for the San 
Diego Clippers, he collapsed with two weeks remaining in 1982-83 with what was 
later diagnosed as an irregular heart beat. He was traded to Milwaukee, where 
he developed into one of the best forwards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MICHAEL BROOKS. A No. 1 draft choice in 1980, he suffered a severe knee 
injury 47 games into the 1983-84 season and never played for the Clippers 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEREK SMITH. The Los Angeles Clippers had a 5-0 start in 1985-86, thanks 
largely to Smith's scoring. Then he suffered torn cartilage in his knee in the 
ninth game, returning for only the final two games. He had continued knee 
problems and never played for the Clippers again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARQUES JOHNSON. After averaging 16.4 and 20.3 points in consecutive 
seasons, he collided with teammate Benoit Benjamin and ruptured a disk in his 
neck 10 games into the 1986-87 season. Johnson missed the rest of the season 
and all of the next. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NORM NIXON. The Clippers sent rookie Byron Scott to the Lakers in a package 
to get Nixon, and the veteran responded with three years of 14.6 points or 
better. Then, he missed all of 1986-87 with a knee injury suffered while 
playing softball. After rehabilitation, he missed all of 1987-88 with a 
ruptured Achilles' tendon suffered during the next-to-last preseason practice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DANNY MANNING. Twenty-six games into his rookie season, he suffered a torn 
anterior cruciate knee ligament Jan. 4, 1989, and was not able to return until 
after this season started. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RON HARPER. Twenty-eight games after he was acquired from Cleveland, he 
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and cartilage damage and will need 
surgery. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

Kenny Tippins of the Dallas Cowboys is among four football players who have 
joined the suspension-riddled and injury-depleted basketball team at Middle 
Tennessee State University. 
</P>
<P>
Tippins, who was on the Cowboys' developmental squad last fall, is back in 
school this semester to complete his degree. 
</P>
<P>
He is eligible to play basketball under NCAA rules because he was never 
redshirted as a college football player at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe all this is really happening," he said. "This is like 
something you hear about happening in the 1950s or '60s."

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE

NO. 16 UCLA (11-2, 5-0) at STANFORD (10-3, 2-2), 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- ESPN. Radio -- KMPC (710). 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, a 73-67 winner over Arizona last Saturday, hopes to keep its perfect 
conference record intact against a Cardinal team that has won 19 of its last 20 
home games. Stanford is led by forward Adam Keefe, a 6-9, 230-pound sophomore 
from Irvine who is the Pac-10's No. 2 scorer and No. 1 rebounder, averaging 21 
points and 10.5 rebounds a game. Forward Andrew Vlahov, who is averaging 9.6 
points and 5.7 rebounds, is the only returning starter from a team that was 
26-7 last season, including two victories over UCLA. The Cardinal won its first 
eight games but has since lost to No. 1-ranked Kansas and to Oregon State and 
Washington in Pac-10 play. 
</P>
<P>
USC (6-6, 1-4) at CALIFORNIA (12-4, 3-2), 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- KNX (1070). 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game matches two of the top freshmen in the Pac-10, USC guard Harold 
Miner and Cal center Brian Hendrick. Miner has averaged 23.3 points in his last 
six games. Hendrick, a 6-foot-8 redshirt freshman from Diamond Bar High, is 
averaging 15.4 points and 7.9 rebounds. He led the NCAA in field goal 
percentage last week with 70.5%. Cal's three-guard offense has been effective. 
Point guard Keith Smith is averaging 16.5 points and 7.4 assists, and backcourt 
mate Ryan Drew is averaging 10.6 points. Forward Roy Fisher has also played 
well, averaging 15.1 points and 6.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
CS FULLERTON (8-6, 2-3) at CS LONG BEACH (11-3, 4-2), 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- SportsChannel. Radio -- KORG (1190). 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach has won five of its last six games and is 6-0 in its 
campus gym. Rebounding from a defeat at UC Santa Barbara, the 49ers defeated 
first-place New Mexico State, 72-56, Monday night as guard Tyrone Mitchell had 
11 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals. Forward Kevin Cutler had 
his best game in a month, scoring 17 points against the Aggies. Cal State 
Fullerton, which lost, 66-60, at San Jose State Monday night, is 2-6 on the 
road. Forward Cedric Ceballos is averaging 21.6 points a game, and guard Mark 
Hill is averaging 20.9. The teams have split their last four games. 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE (2-13, 0-6) at NEVADA LAS VEGAS (11-3, 5-1), 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- Channel 56. Radio -- KORG (1190). 
</P>
<P>
A loss tonight would clinch Irvine's second consecutive losing season and only 
the third in Coach Bill Mulligan's 10 seasons. Irvine has not won since 
defeating San Diego State, 75-62, on Dec. 16, a streak of eight losses. UNLV, 
the nation's ninth-ranked team, is tied for the conference lead with New Mexico 
State. Irvine is in last place. UNLV returns home after four road games, 
including victories at Temple on Saturday and Fresno State on Monday. An NCAA 
investigation into an unpaid school loan sidelined guard Anderson Hunt, the 
Rebels' third-leading scorer, for the Temple game. But Hunt, who averages 15.1 
points, returned against Fresno State. Forward Larry Johnson leads the Rebels, 
averaging 20.6 points and 10.7 rebounds. Center Ricky Butler averages 15.1 
points to lead Irvine.

HE CAN RUN, BUT HE CAN'T HIDE: WINNING HORSE DISQUALIFIED IN THE FOG

It was so foggy when Landing Officer sprinted to a 20-length victory last 
Thursday at Delta Downs that racing officials couldn't see much of the race. 
And once they reviewed it, they decided the results were murky enough to 
disqualify the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Some stewards think jockey Sylvester Carmouche hid the 5-year-old horse in the 
fog and waited for the rest of the pack to approach before breaking for the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a question in my mind whether he won or not," said Clyde Stevens, a 
racing steward. "I also have a question of where he was during the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
The fog was so thick the track announcer stopped calling the races. 
</P>
<P>
J.L. Vincent, track security director, told the Houston Chronicle that 
Carmouche could have hidden in the fog after the start, waiting for the field 
to approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to hide at the top of the stretch down there because 
the fog was so thick," Vincent said. "That's what we think happened because 
when the horses came by the first time, we counted only eight, and there were 
nine starters." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said two jockeys filed a protest immediately after the race. After a 
20-minute delay, the stewards dropped Landing Officer to ninth. 
</P>
<P>
He said a state Racing Commission inquiry is scheduled today into Carmouche's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
The win for Landing Officer would have represented a 32-length improvement over 
his last run at a mile.

VALENZUELA GIVEN SECOND FIVE-DAY SUSPENSION -- AND HE'S VERY UPSET

For the second time in the first 18 days of the meeting, Pat Valenzuela was 
suspended Wednesday by the Santa Anita stewards. 
</P>
<P>
Set down for five days after Flom was disqualified in the first race on opening 
day, Valenzuela will begin another enforced vacation Saturday for causing 
interference in Monday's seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
According to steward Tom Ward, Valenzuela, aboard Imperial Star, cut in and 
caused interference on the far turn to Regal Fawn, who was ridden by Chris 
Davenport, and Sparrow Lake, who was ridden by Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the stretch, Imperial Star bumped Sparrow Lake, then McCarron 
struck Valenzuela across the back with his whip.

His own suspension and McCarron's $200 fine had Valenzuela seething Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's complete . . . " he said. "It seems like whenever Pat makes a mistake, he 
gets an automatic five-day suspension. Chris said, 'You . . . ,' and then he 
let me have it with his whip. He was looking straight at me. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he only got a $200 fine. I can't judge whether or not I should 
have gotten days, but I'll accept them. If I deserved days, he deserved them 
also. If that's not careless riding, I don't know what is. I can't believe the 
way they treated Chris. It's complete baloney." 
</P>
<P>
Although he admitted calling Valenzuela an obscene name at the time, McCarron 
said he had not meant to hit him with the whip. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it looks terrible on the film and it does look like a retaliatory act, 
but it was an accident," he said. "Because of the way it looks, it is hard for 
me to convince anybody of that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been squeezed twice and bounced off the fence. I'm not going to get into 
it anymore. I lost my cool. It was totally out of character for me and I'm 
sorry the whole thing happened. I'm not happy with being fined, but that's the 
way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Favored Fit To Scout made it two victories in a row for trainer Jack Van Berg 
as she held off Annual Reunion to win the $83,625 La Centinela Stakes before 
13,361 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing well under McCarron, the 3-year-old filly took over with about three 
furlongs to run and beat an unlucky Annual Reunion by three-quarters of a 
length in 1:38 3/5 for the mile on a good track. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of one of her two starts in Kentucky, Fit To Scout has won two of 
three in California. She ran second to For My Mom at seven furlongs at 
Hollywood Park before upsetting Nijinsky's Lover in a Santa Anita allowance 
race Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good filly and we knew she'd be able to route," Van Berg said. "Bob 
Snell and I picked her out of the Saratoga sale (for $95,000). I don't know 
what's next for her. We'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
Running extremely wide most of the way, Annual Reunion, who was second at 38-1 
in the Hollywood Starlet, finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of third-place Nasers 
Pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a shame," said Gary Boulanger, who rode the runner-up. "Her last 
two outs, if we go farther or have any kind of trip, we win a Grade I and this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I rode her, she backed up when the dirt hit her in the face. In 
the Starlet, she was more willing to run through the dirt and it was the same 
today. A mile may be a little too short for her." 
</P>
<P>
Royce McKinley, the chairman and chief executive officer of Santa Anita Realty 
Enterprises, maintains that Canterbury Downs can be a success. 
</P>
<P>
In a deal signed Tuesday with New Jersey investor John Aglialoro, Santa Anita 
sold its 39% interest in the financially troubled Minneapolis-area track. Built 
in 1985, Canterbury Downs has since lost $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it can be successful," McKinley said. "It's a very fine smaller 
facility. The track surface is very good and the ambience is great. We just had 
too much debt service on it. 
</P>
<P>
"If the original projections that we were given had been met, we wouldn't have 
had any problems. The (betting) average per capita around the country is $155. 
The per capita at Canterbury was $116. If we'd had anything like the average 
per capita, we would have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key thing is that people there have to be educated about horse 
racing and how to bet on the races. We're deeply disappointed and we'd like it 
to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"The people we sold to are quality people who are determined to make it go and 
they have the financial standing to support it. They think they can make it 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the deal with Aglialoro includes a 10-year simulcasting contract, 
allowing races from Santa Anita to be shown for wagering purposes at 
Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
"If the new owners want our advice on anything, we'd be happy to consult with 
them," McKinley said. "We'd like to see the operation become a success." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fit To Scout paid $6.80 to win. . . . Alex Solis had three winners Wednesday 
and took over the lead in the jockey standings. He now has 19, one more than 
Gary Stevens and two more than Eddie Delahoussaye, who begins a five-day 
suspension today. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Hawley will begin riding at Santa Anita Friday. He is named on two 
horses, Peppy's Kingdom in the fifth and Mr. Fairway in the sixth. . . . Both 
the Bay Meadows Oaks Saturday and the El Camino Real Derby Sunday will be 
simulcast at Santa Anita.

A LITTLE SNOW INCLUDED WITH A LOT OF WEATHER; 
</P>
<P>
STORM: COUNTY SEES SNOW, RAIN, HAIL AND SUNSHINE ALL IN ONE DAY. EVEN 
FORECASTERS FOUND IT 'PRETTY EXCITING.'

The second significant storm in a week sloshed through California's open "storm 
door" Wednesday, delighting residents of several Orange County communities with 
a burst of snow but causing a fatal traffic accident in Irvine that killed 
three people. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell for more than in hour Wednesday evening in Trabuco Canyon and in its 
lower-lying neighbors, Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza. It also dusted 
the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains, in the Antelope Valley, and in the 
Tehachapi and San Bernardino ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said Orange County experienced all the major elements of the 
weather Wednesday -- snow, hail, rain and sunshine. "It's certainly a unique 
place," said Rick Dittman, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. "This was a pretty exciting (weather) system that 
brought along almost everything." 
</P>
<P>
Cold rain fell in torrents at times, slowing traffic on rain-slick freeways and 
streets. And in the afternoon, hail accompanied by frequent bursts of thunder 
and lightning pounded some areas of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains and low visibility were contributed to the deaths of three people 
on the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine early Wednesday, the California Highway 
Patrol said. The driver of a van apparently lost control in a downpour and 
struck a guardrail. The three occupants of the van were killed when a truck hit 
it from behind. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP identified the van driver as Wayne Wonhyung Yoo, 29, and his passengers 
as Suk Young Yoo, 25, and Au Do Park, 55. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Margarita residents, who woke up Wednesday morning to see the 
foothills of Saddleback covered with snow, were in for another rare treat. 
</P>
<P>
Around 4 p.m. Wednesday, snowflakes began fluttering down the mountain, 
temporarily covering lush green lawns in the three South County communities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I call postcard perfect," said Rancho Santa Margarita resident 
Kevin Cartwright as he looked through the living room window of his condominium 
overlooking Lago Santa Margarita. "The sun is shining. The snow is falling. The 
yard is covered (with snow). And we even have a rainbow over the mountain. What 
more can you want?" 
</P>
<P>
Scores of children gathered outside to catch the falling flakes and make tiny 
snowballs. "This is exciting!" shrieked 9-year-old Katy Watson of Rancho Santa 
Margarita. "I want it to snow more! I want to build a snowman!" 
</P>
<P>
But her wishes were short-lived. Almost as soon as the snowflakes stopped 
falling, bursts of lightning and thunder ushered in a downpour that quickly 
washed away the small accumulation of snow. 
</P>
<P>
At Coto de Caza near Mission Viejo, snow fell for about half an hour starting 
around 4:30 p.m. Some of the snow accumulated, but it melted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," said Gerald Bailey, a visitor at Coto de Caza's equestrian 
center. "One of the most beautiful days I've seen here." 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear Lake reported 8 to 12 inches of new snow, and a foot to a foot and a 
half of snow was on the ground at Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Southland, the scene was less picturesque. A small tornado 
swept at tree-top height along a fifth-of-a-mile path in Pico Rivera on Tuesday 
night, damaging the roofs of at least three homes and toppling trees. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Carpenter, a resident of Leisure World Apartments in Seal Beach, said 
it was around the same time when heavy winds swept away the patio roof of her 
building. Orange County firefighters assisted her in cleaning the broken 
windows and debris from the fallen roof. 
</P>
<P>
"The (firefighters) told me it was probably a spiral tornado," Carpenter said. 
"But I thought that a plane crashed into the building. It made a quick 
swooshing noise and it was over." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said a contractor estimated damage to her building at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Snow and ice forced the brief closure of the Antelope Valley Freeway in 
northern Los Angeles county Wednesday morning. The weather was blamed for 16 
traffic accidents in that area, including a 10-car pileup, in less than an hour 
during morning commuting hours. No serious injuries were reported, but the CHP 
reported that tangled cars littered a five-mile stretch of the freeway, which 
was closed from Angeles Forest Highway north to Palmdale Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dropped 0.57 of an inch of rainfall in Anaheim and 0.75 in San Juan 
Capistrano. The heavy rainfall kept roofing contractors busy. Don Ritz, the 
owner of Custom Roofing in Orange, said that his business was booming. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty hectic," he said, noting that he responded to 50 complaints 
of leaky roofs Wednesday. "We have anything from ceilings collapsing to tile 
floating." 
</P>
<P>
The cold weather forced homeless people to flock to shelters. The Orange County 
Rescue Mission in Santa Ana was packed to capacity Wednesday night. Joe Furey, 
the mission's night chaplain, said 54 homeless people had crammed into the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"When the weather gets cold and rainy, we get full," Furey said. "We've been 
full for the past week." 
</P>
<P>
John Webb, a research and planning manager for the Orange County Social 
Services Agency, said an additional 63 homeless people had checked into the 
Fullerton National Guard Armory, which is opened for the homeless in cold 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 people had also filled to capacity the agency's makeshift shelter at 
St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church of Newport Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dittman of WeatherData Inc. said Wednesday that Southern Californians can 
expect more cool temperatures for the next few nights, especially in inland 
valleys, with nighttime lows possibly in the 20s in Riverside, Beaumont, 
Ontario and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's high temperature in Santa Ana was 59 degrees. The low was 43. 
Relative humidity ranged from 43% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Dittman predicted that the weather will be "generally unsettled" for the 
remainder of the week as the upper-level cold front of the departing storm 
moves east, but lingers over Southwestern states for a day or two.

SEWAGE SPILL FOULS STREETS, O.C. BEACHES 
</P>

<P>
A 250,000-gallon sewage spill Wednesday at a regional treatment pant in 
Fountain Valley flooded several major streets, prompted health authorities to 
quarantine an eight-mile stretch of beach and caused raw effluent to cascade 
into basement dressing rooms at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the Fountain Valley Treatment Plant said they were unsure what 
caused sewage to begin backing up at the sprawling processing facility, sending 
waste sloshing out of manholes to cover nearby streets at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All systems at the plant were back to normal an hour later, but the sewage had 
by then spilled into storm drains leading to the Santa Ana River and flowed 
into the ocean, said Blake Anderson, technical services director for the 
Sanitation District of Orange County, operators of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is there's no sewage spilling right now," Anderson said 
Wednesday night. "But we're baffled. We're still trying to locate the cause of 
the backup." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials, concerned about potential health problems, shut down a 
stretch of beach fanning out from the mouth of the Santa Ana River. Beaches 
between Newport Pier on the south and Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach on 
the north will be posted with signs warning against swimming in the ocean, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipated rain and storm-driven surf should help dissipate the sewage, and 
the quarantine will probably last only a few days and no longer than a week, he 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials will begin taking bacterial counts of the surf beginning today 
to determine when the beaches should be reopened, Anderson said. County health 
officials could not be reached for comment on the sewage spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a health hazard for anyone who swims the ocean off the quarantine 
area," Anderson said. "People should stay out of the water until the health 
department reopens those sections of beach." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Manda of the Fountain Valley police said officers began receiving 
reports shortly after 5:30 p.m. of flooding on several streets surrounding the 
sewage plant, located just south of the San Diego Freeway and west of the Santa 
Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous motorists plowed through huge pools of sewage stretching from sidewalk 
to sidewalk along Euclid Street and Ellis Avenue. Sewage also poured from 
manholes just across the river from the plant, flooding a short stretch of 
California Street. 
</P>
<P>
Police later shut down all three streets for several hours, authorities said, 
as well as the San Diego Freeway's southbound exit at Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said 16 cleanup crews on tanker trucks were dispatched by the sewage 
plant Wednesday night to wash the effluent down storm drains with a mix of 
water and disinfectant. Rains should also help wash down the streets. Any 
remaining sewage puddled on the streets would not not represent a health threat 
to motorists or residents of surrounding neighborhoods, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bryant, a spokesman for the Performing Arts Center, said the problem at 
the plant caused sewage to back up and spew out of floor drains in the concert 
hall's basement, which houses more than a dozen dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Center employees had to rush to mop up the flowing sewage and rescue several 
elaborate costumes for the opera "La Traviata," which has a performance 
tonight. Bryant said none of the costumes was damaged and he expects the 
dressing rooms to dry out in plenty of time for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Workers discovered the effluent cascading from the floor drains about 5:30 
p.m., just as they were leaving for the evening. Several maintenance employees 
used squeegees to push the foul-smelling waste water into a sump that pumped it 
into the city storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, the sewage crested at about an inch or two, then began to 
recede, leaving little more than patches of soggy carpet in the dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Although no performance was in progress when the effluent began pumping into 
the basement, about 50 young children from the Turandot Children's Choir were 
practicing at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It totally stunk really bad," said Melissa Wyatt Trutz, 11, of Laguna Niguel. 
"We had to hold our noses." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Woods, also 11, agreed that "it sure stunk." The Irvine youth and his 
friends in the choir had no idea what was happening until they saw a sign in 
the bathroom that read "Don't Flush."

Map, Sewage Spill -- A 250,000-gallon spill at 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Fountain 
Valley wastewater treatment plant caused a rash of problems before systems at

PRISONERS CON THE LONELY WITH HUGE PEN PAL SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Paul Hammer was a prisoner at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester a 
few years ago when he bragged to a reporter for an alternative magazine that he 
had received at least $176,000 from 1,500 to 2,000 people he had duped into 
sending him money. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is making them fall in love with you through letters and on the 
phone," Hammer told the Los Angeles-based magazine, the Advocate. "And I mean 
people who are lonely are so willing and vulnerable because they're reaching 
out and they're wanting something." 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, prisoners' ploys to acquire and psychologically manipulate 
pen pals -- frequently homosexual men -- have resulted in the loss of millions 
of dollars and countless broken dreams over the past 15 years, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the stakes have risen as pen pal scams have figured in the murders of 
four gay men, three in Mississippi and one in New York, who had been writing to 
the murder suspects when they were behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday in San Clemente, former Indiana inmate Keith Eugene Goodman and two 
associates were arrested in separate SWAT team raids on suspicion of stalking 
Goodman's prison pen pals and killing them after committing robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, 30, walked out of state prison with thousands of dollars from pen pals 
whom he had apparently persuaded to send money, said New York State Police 
investigator Richard J. Kadien. 
</P>
<P>
One of Goodman's suspected victims, Harold Williams, 60, found shot to death 
Dec. 17 in his Upstate New York home, had apparently paid a $500 phone bill 
accumulated answering collect calls from Goodman. He had also sent Goodman a 
total of $300 while they wrote each other. 
</P>
<P>
For long-term, maximum security inmates with time on their hands and nothing to 
lose, "scamming" outsiders is probably the most popular and lucrative of all 
prison "businesses," including the sale of illegal drugs, said Annette Viator, 
chief legal counsel for the Louisiana Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have conservatively estimated that 10% of the 5,500 inmates at 
Angola Penitentiary in Louisiana, with or without outside contacts, have taken 
in more than $1 million in a recent three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Homosexuals, sometimes vulnerable to blackmail and unlikely to file complaints, 
are the primary target of such scams, she said, followed by religious people 
who want to help the less fortunate, and lonely subscribers to singles 
magazines carrying personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
Some inmates also subscribe to metropolitan newspapers to contact people listed 
in divorce or real estate transactions. "Inmates who are truly looking to scam 
a large number of people leave no stone unturned for a source," Viator said. 
</P>
<P>
Typical victims include a 67-year-old Orange County widow who spent $3,000 and 
sold her home to bankroll a prisoner who said he needed to pay off legal fees, 
according to Viator. In Canada, a homosexual high-ranking aide to a Canadian 
Parliament official lost $30,000 to pen pals who blackmailed him, then informed 
his boss about his homosexuality anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Viator said that many people are surprised to learn that the dupes are often 
intelligent professionals. "They're not stupid. They're just very trusting." 
</P>
<P>
The cons are "chameleons," she said. "It's amazing how they know how to fit 
their identify to a person who needs them. If you're a homosexual, they'll say, 
'So am I.' If you're a lonely old man, they'll say, 'I'm a young girl who never 
had a family.' " 
</P>
<P>
For example, an ad reading "Be My Summer Lover," placed last year in the 
Advocate, was signed only "Eddie." An established Santa Cruz professional, just 
jilted by his gay lover, picked up the magazine and replied. It resulted, he 
said, in an emotional and financial nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
As the man found out later, after voluntarily sending "Eddie" $17,200, his pen 
pal was not the "cuddly, shy" 23-year-old Texan he claimed to be. Instead he 
was a 43-year-old convicted murderer, spending his time in a Louisiana prison 
bilking money from emotionally vulnerable people. 
</P>
<P>
"Often minorities feel we're all in this together," said the 55-year-old Santa 
Cruz man who asked not to be identified. "Here was this gay young man. I'm gay. 
When (one feels) the majority is out to get you, minorities protect one 
another. I adopted a father or protector role. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out sending him money to get out of trouble, to get him out here to 
California, then to post bonds as he kept getting in 'trouble.' 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I realized I had no more money, I had borrowed up to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer he had contacted to help "Eddie" instead made him realize that he had 
been duped. After the initial embarrassment, he said, he was relieved. "What I 
could not handle was thinking that this kid is going to go to prison and get 
raped because I couldn't help him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The man now has a civil suit pending against "Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
Viator says the scams are difficult to stop, partly because overburdened and 
under-funded prosecutors are unwilling to spend time and money to charge and 
try prisoners already serving life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities cited the relative ease of raising bogus money orders 
-- the nation's single-largest prison scam. 
</P>
<P>
One scheme known to investigators as the Parchman Money Order Scam has waxed 
and waned at the Mississippi Penitentiary in Parchman for 15 years, said Mike 
Hesse, Memphis, Tenn., postal inspector whose jurisdiction includes the prison. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, about 60 prisoners there were involved in a bogus money order scheme 
soliciting pen pals through personal ads in magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, authorities said, an inmate writes to his victim saying he is in 
prison because he made a mistake, is serving a short jail sentence and is 
financially secure. Then the letters become more intimate with the inmate 
asking for the pen-pal's phone number and starting to call collect. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the prisoner will talk about relocating near the victim to begin a 
sincere relationship and then send his pen pal a $1 or $5 money order, altered 
in the prison press shop to read $100 or $500. Believing the prisoner to be an 
innocent victim, needing money for attorney fees or other reasons, the pen pals 
will help smuggle the cash in. 
</P>
<P>
Once the inmate feels he has bilked the victims as long as he can, the 
relationship is ended. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, postal investigators found more than 3,500 money orders at the 
Mississippi prison with an altered value of $1.6 million. In 1989, the value 
was $1.4 million, of which $400,000 was recovered -- from the victims 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kennedy, Los Angeles area director of Prison Fellowship Ministries, a 
Christian organization founded by Watergate figure Charles Colson, said he 
warns many well-meaning pen pal volunteers against giving their addresses to 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
A recent episode of the comedy television show "Golden Girls" dealt with a 
surprise visit from a prison pen pal with whom one of the women characters had 
carried on a torrid correspondence, figuring that he was safely guarded. Such 
episodes can occur in real life and are far from funny, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said that some prisoners "prey on well-meaning volunteers to do a 
number of things -- to get them money, to do special favors, make contacts in 
the community for them, send in special items for them. Sometimes they 
intimidate the volunteer. 'If you don't do what I ask you, I'll do this or 
that, hurt your family.' It's rare, but it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he trains pen pals to communicate clearly that they want nothing 
more than a friendly relationship by mail and not to respond to sexual 
propositions. 
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable are gullible people who think they understand an inmate's 
mentality, he said. "I'm real scared for people like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Advocate accepts personal ads from prisoners but also prints periodic 
warnings against bogus ads and scams. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some prisoners complain about pen pals writing them, then 
cutting off contact abruptly, said Mike Riegle, office manager for the Gay 
Community News, an 8,000-circulation publication that goes to 600 prisoners and 
carries a Prisoners Seeking Friends column. 
</P>
<P>
Despite negative experiences, he encourages prison correspondence. "Any kind of 
contact they can maintain to make them feel like a human being is crucial," 
said Riegle. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, authorities have transferred scammers to other prisons in an 
attempt to break up gangs, but attempts to stop scams have had spotty results. 
</P>
<P>
At Parchman, prison officials agreed to take away conjugal visits of scammers 
and place them in a special lockup, Hesse said. "The money order problem went 
down to zero." But inmates petitioned a federal court in Jackson, Miss., 
claiming that they were receiving punishment without being charged with a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
When officials could not prove their claims, they were forced to release them 
and the problem "skyrocketed," Hesse said. 
</P>
<P>
Viator said the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office have also investigated the 
scams, but no charges have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to crush the scams, Angola last year initiated a so-called Scam 
Tier -- a special row for inmates convicted by an in-house review board of 
scamming. On the row, the only communications they are allowed are monitored by 
prison officials. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the 20 inmates on Scam Tier have joined a class-action suit, now 
pending before a federal judge, claiming that the privacy of their 
attorney-client relationships has been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Though a lower court magistrate has already ruled in favor of the inmates, 
Viator said she is not fighting a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, I'll take it to the court of appeals. Even though the right to 
attorney-client privilege is important, other things can outweigh it."

STUDY URGING SALE OF SEIZED RANCH KEPT FROM BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A controversial report recommending that the county sell a $1.2-million ranch 
-- instead of giving it to the sheriff for a narcotics training center -- was 
withheld from the Board of Supervisors for more than three months, The Times 
learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the delay, at least portions of the report were made available to 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, who strongly opposes the sale, according to a 
county administrator and an irate supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Gates denied that he has seen the report, which will not be submitted to the 
Board of Supervisors until Friday, but he conceded that his staff had been 
briefed on it some time late last year. According to county administrators, the 
report was first requested by supervisors two years ago. The board again 
requested the report last spring, and it was finished in October. 
</P>
<P>
The county administrative office report recommends that the sprawling, 213-acre 
Rancho del Rio, on the border of Orange and Riverside counties and seized 
during a drug raid in early 1988, be sold to help defray the costs of the 
Sheriff's Department, estimated to be running about $6 million in the red this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"My office has received strong indication that the report was held up in the 
county administrator's office and made available to the sheriff or his 
personnel rather than being forwarded to the board," an angry Supervisor Roger 
R. Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fault lies with whoever made the decision to withhold the information, 
which is basically withholding it from the people of Orange County," he said. 
"If you can't trust the people that you hire to work for the taxpayers, then we 
ought to have a whole new crew come in." 
</P>
<P>
John W. Sibley, associate county administrative officer for finances, confirmed 
that a draft of the report was completed last October, but he said that Larry 
Parrish, who was then chief administrative officer, decided to hold on to the 
report. Sibley said he did not know why Parrish did not submit the report last 
fall. Parrish has since left the office to become a full-time lobbyist for the 
firm that represents the county's interest in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish said in a telephone interview that he had had several discussion with 
Gates about the "looming recommendation that the ranch be sold." He said he did 
not remember whether he had given Gates a copy of the report but that he 
thought he had. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish said he did not think the report was ready to be submitted to the Board 
of Supervisors. "Staff had developed a position that they thought was sound. I 
wasn't certain of it at that time," he recounted. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley also said Gates indicated at a budget meeting Wednesday that he had 
already seen a copy of the report, but the sheriff denied it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say some of the staff" may not have been told about the 
recommendations, Gates added when asked about Sibley's comments. "We've been 
told that the original report's recommendation was to sell." 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the county rezone the property and divide it into 
residential lots before putting it up for sale. Such a move could increase the 
value of the property to $2 million, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
That money could be used to pay off some of the Sheriff Department's deficit, 
which is running about $6 million, according to Sibley's estimate. The 
department has exceeded its budget, reportedly because of additional salaries, 
medical supplies, clothing for jail inmates and rising transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go over budget and then pour money into a new facility," said Board 
Chairman Don R. Roth, who has been increasingly critical of the politically 
powerful sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the cowboy hat," Roth quipped. "I just have a few ideas about the 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
Gates dismissed criticism of his recommendation to turn Rancho del Rio into a 
training center for narcotics agents, contending instead that it would allow 
the county to train 90 officers a year at no extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the center would be staffed by educators from local colleges and 
universities. Construction costs for transforming the ranch into a training 
center would be donated by local business leaders and the Sheriff's Advisory 
Council, a private group of local business and community leaders, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates warned that selling the ranch to reduce his department's deficit would 
probably violate the intent of federal drug laws. Under the Comprehensive Crime 
Control Act of 1984, local law enforcement agencies may use property and cash 
seized from drug dealers to enhance their battle against traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"As we understand it, it's not supposed to be used to augment the normal budget 
. . . " Gates said. "The money is supposed to go toward narcotics and drug 
enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho del Rio is the former property of Daniel James Fowlie, who is in prison 
in La Paz, Mexico, fighting extradition on charges of running a 
marijuana-smuggling operation out of the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at the prison Wednesday, Fowlie said he believes the property may have 
been seized illegally by the federal government and that the county could have 
problems if it tries to sell it.

A convicted burglar who had worked off jail time at the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department Training Facility in Orange broke into a shed and stole 42 handguns, 
then sold or traded some of them for drugs, Sheriff's Department investigators 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lee Blomgren, 20, of Fullerton and seven other people have been arrested 
in connection with the theft of the handguns, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The gun thefts have prompted the Sheriff's Department to take a closer look at 
how weapons are stored at the training facility and how the department itself 
became a crime victim, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought (security) was pretty good," Gates said. "But the criminal mind can 
figure out a way to get into almost anything." 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred sometime around New Year's Day, officers said. On Jan. 3, 
Blomgren and Bonnie Jean Clark, 21, of Fullerton were arrested on suspicion of 
burglary at Clark's home in Fullerton, where 11 handguns were recovered, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also recovered an undisclosed amount of "rock" cocaine and 
narcotics paraphernalia at the residence, according to court documents filed in 
connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Blomgren and Clark were being held in Orange County Jail on $25,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Two more stolen handguns were recovered and four people were arrested at the 
Best Western Stardust Motel in Anaheim last Thursday. Charged with receiving 
stolen property were Devin Michael Puckett, 22, of Anaheim, Bradley Dean 
Denson, 26, of Fullerton, Gretchen Michelle Ales, 25, of Stanton and Richard 
Joseph Johnson, 22, of Stanton. All four also were being held in Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department Sgt. James S. Lazzaro, who is heading the investigation, 
said there was a "minor pursuit" before the capture of some of the suspects. He 
did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting at 
Lazzaro outside the motel. In addition, Johnson and Denson were charged with 
auto theft -- for allegedly stealing a 1982 Mazda pickup found at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Nunn, who is handling the case against Puckett, 
Denson, Ales and Johnson, would not elaborate on the charges, referring all 
questions to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview at the Orange County Jail, Denson said he knew nothing 
about the stolen handguns and was simply "in the wrong place at the wrong 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting a ride home from a friend of mine," he said. "This is way out of 
my line." 
</P>
<P>
Ten more stolen handguns were recovered as a result of searches conducted in 
Anaheim and Fullerton, Lazzaro said. Altogether, investigators have recovered 
23 of the 42 stolen guns. The rest were allegedly sold or traded for drugs in 
Orange, San Bernardino or Riverside counties, Sheriff's Department 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators provided a few details about the burglary at the training 
facility after mention of the incident in Wednesday's Times. Lazzaro said the 
handguns -- the majority of them standard-issue Smith and Wesson .38-caliber 
revolvers -- were kept in a shed that was not protected by the alarm system 
that guards the rest of the training facility. 
</P>
<P>
The training facility, on West Katella Avenue near the Orange Freeway, is used 
by several law-enforcement agencies for classroom work as well as target 
practice at the facility's two firing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
"This took place when no one was around," Lazzaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Lazzaro would not say what led authorities to Blomgren and Clark. However, he 
said that Blomgren had worked at the training facility during his sentence on a 
prior conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"They do anything from rake leaves to mow the lawns out there," Lazzaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Blomgren recently finished serving a 180-day sentence for violating his 
probation on a 1988 burglary conviction that involved computers stolen from 
schools in Anaheim, where Blomgren had been a student. He was back on probation 
at the time of the gun thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Blomgren is also suspected of committing two other burglaries at the training 
facility -- one in November and one in December -- during which power tools and 
air compressors were stolen, Lazzaro said. A stolen air compressor was 
recovered during the gun-theft investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other people also have been arrested as a result of the gun-theft 
investigation. Daniel Drew, 35, of Anaheim, was arrested Jan. 5 on suspicion of 
possessing drugs for sale and possessing explosive devices. Steven Adkins, 21, 
of Westminster, was arrested Jan. 9 on warrants stemming from drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had received information that both Drew and Adkins knew something 
about the stolen weapons, but no guns were recovered when they were arrested, 
Lazzaro said. 
</P>
<P>
Lazzaro said he did not know what kind of explosive devices Drew had, or what 
he might have been planning to do with them.

STORM TRIPS AN OLD ALARM, CAUSES SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panic-stricken residents who mistook an old fire alarm for a warning siren from 
the nearby San Onofre nuclear power plant jammed emergency telephone lines at 
the police station for about 20 minutes Tuesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire alarm, located across from the San Clemente police and fire station on 
Avenida Presidio, which has not been in use since 1978, was accidentally 
tripped around 11:35 p.m. by high winds and heavy rain, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The loud siren, which can be heard throughout this seaside city of 35,000, was 
once the city's only way to alert its off-duty and volunteer fire crews in an 
emergency, Police Sgt. Richard Downing said. The system was made obsolete when 
fire personnel were issued pagers. 
</P>
<P>
Several emergency sirens for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, located 
five miles south of the city, are set up throughout South Orange County. 
Officials said these sirens were not sounded or affected by the storm system 
that swept through the area.

COMPROMISE PLAN ACCEPTED FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of debate and review, city officials have selected a compromise 
plan for a 10-acre park on the ridgeline at Top of the World. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a good compromise," Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be tucked pretty well in and open space wraps all around it." 
</P>
<P>
The revised Alta Laguna park plan, to include a regulation-size baseball field 
and a six-court tennis facility, tot lot, parking, view sites and a trail 
around the outside, will be developed at the end of Alta Laguna Boulevard next 
to hundreds of acres of open space, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally conceived as a 15-acre facility with a soccer field on a five-acre, 
mini-park site and an adjacent 10 acres purchased by the city, the plan was 
scaled down to satisfy objections of environmentalists and Top of the World 
residents, despite pleas from parents and sports enthusiasts for a larger park. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the park have questioned the need for the facility and expressed 
concern over loss of wetlands, the aesthetics of drainage devices, traffic and 
the loss of designated open space. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council simply ignored the wishes and desires of those most affected 
by the park," said Robert May, a Top of the World resident. "People who live 
here on Alta Laguna wanted the park maintained on five acres and opposed any 
encroachment on the greenbelt and over-concentration of sports in one 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But Fitzpatrick said the decision was fair. 
</P>
<P>
"The proponents gave a much stronger argument and obviously people who 
participate in sports didn't get all that they wanted either," he said. "The 
opponents came across as fairly selfish. I honestly believe the majority of 
people who are concerned about the park will enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun will still set up there." LESLIE HERZOG

block the conversion of Yorba Linda's only general hospital into a psychiatric 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be it," said Sue McDougall, a leading opponent of the hospital. "We 
might just have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began earlier this month when residents who live near the 
Bastanchury Road site told the council they feared mentally unstable people 
would leave the hospital and roam through their quiet hillside neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda officials have maintained that state laws prevent the city from 
taking any action to block the conversion of the former St. Jude Hospital to 
Yorba Hills Hospital, an 80-bed psychiatric center designed to treat people 
suffering from depression, drug addiction and eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
California law prohibits cities from making distinctions between mental 
hospitals and other types of hospitals; therefore, the Yorba Hills conversion 
does not violate the facility's 1984 conditional-use permit, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hamstrung from taking any action," Councilman Mark Schwing said. 
"There's nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, hospital opponents, armed with a petition signed by more than 200 
people and a letter suggesting that the council take advantage of a loophole in 
the state law to block the hospital, converged on City Hall on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The petition urged the council to block the hospital. The letter, by Steve 
Brunette, an attorney who lives a few blocks from Yorba Linda Hills, asked the 
council to take action against the hospital by requesting a new environmental 
impact report or declaring the hospital a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"We wondered if we have to wait until the child is run over before they put up 
a stop sign," Brunette said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said all the legal issues brought out in the letter had been 
considered by the city attorney before he advised the council. 
</P>
<P>
An open house and tour of the hospital on Sunday drew more than 200 people; 
some residents who attended said that they didn't mind having the facility in 
Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials stressed that the facility is not a state mental institution 
or prison and that Yorba Hills' screening process would weed out potentially 
dangerous patients. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to watch, wait and see what turns out," Schwing said. "There's 
just nothing we can do at this point." SHELBY GRAD

RAIL TRANSIT RUNS ON CASH, OFFICIALS LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Bright images of sleek monorail trains traveling between -- and within -- 
gleaming office towers excited a gathering of city, county and regional 
officials here Wednesday, but their enthusiasm was tempered by the reality that 
the success of rail transit in Orange County will depend on public support and 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much more of an art than a science," transportation consultant Alan 
Wulkan cautioned the more than 70 people who attended the briefing on two 
ongoing, countywide rail transit studies. 
</P>
<P>
The briefing, sponsored by the Orange County Transportation Commission, was 
held at the Garden Grove Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
One study, aimed at planning commuter or regional passenger train service along 
the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route currently served by Amtrak, is being 
conducted by Irvine-based Fluor Daniel Corp. at a cost of $238,000. The second 
study, actually a plan for countywide rail transit in the year 2010 and beyond, 
is being conducted by the Los Angeles-based firm of PBQ&amp;D at a cost of 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission held Wednesday's briefing to invite city, county 
and regional officials to participate in the two studies, which will be 
completed within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Five central Orange County cities are already are discussing the possibility of 
a monorail system. Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, a leader in that effort, 
cautioned that while the commission's countywide planning perspective is 
necessary and desirable, it shouldn't "delay or dampen, or in any way hold back 
the entrepreneurial effort on the part of one or more cities." 
</P>
<P>
A slide show of monorails, skyway people movers and other forms of rail transit 
in places such as Disney World, Detroit and Miami was screened, while 
PBQ&amp;D's Wulkan carefully pointed out that many key issues, such as 
development densities, financing, and links to other forms of transportation 
must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer period, members of the audience, which included 
mayors and council members from many Orange County cities, pointed out that 
rail transit is a popular concept these days because of near-paralysis on the 
freeways. But they said they also were worried that some people will be put off 
if they have to live near a rail station that does not blend in with their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how people will be persuaded to ride a rail transit system once it's 
built, Wulkan said: "Marketing." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, La Palma Mayor Eva Miner said OCTC's rail effort is 
praiseworthy, but added that financing will be up to taxpayers. JEFFREY A.

39 DRIVE-IN MAY FALL FOR SHOPS, HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chill of a cold January night didn't discourage the movie-goers who began 
lining up outside the Hi-Way 39 Drive-In more than an hour before dusk. 
</P>
<P>
As it has since the drive-in theater opened in 1955, the crowd included 
families in station wagons, young couples on dates and teen-agers crowded into 
cars. By the time "Back to the Future, Part II" appeared on the screen, the 
drive-in was packed. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene, repeated nightly for 35 years, eventually might be history. 
Hi-Way 39 Drive-In is one of a dwindling number of drive-ins in the county. If 
Westminster officials have their way, it, too, soon will disappear and be 
replaced by a shopping center or hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles V. Smith said he would like to see the 25-acre site used in a way 
that is more financially lucrative to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the location of the drive-in, off Beach Boulevard just south of the 
Garden Grove Freeway, makes it prime commercial property that could bring the 
city as much as $1 million in sales tax each year after a shopping center or 
hotel were built. 
</P>
<P>
"It will remain a drive-in for at least another year," Smith said. "But there's 
a strong chance that we'll be working on some plans by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jerry Kenny said his staff has been meeting with representatives 
of Pacific Theaters for nine months, discussing the "highest and best use of 
the property." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny said a final decision on closure of the drive-in is up to Pacific 
Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Moritz, a spokesman for Pacific Theaters, insists that the closure isn't 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has been talking about closing the drive-in for years," Moritz said. 
"As far as we know, we're still operating a drive-in there, and a very popular 
one at that." 
</P>
<P>
Hi-Way 39 and Anaheim Drive-In are the only drive-ins operating year-round in 
Orange County. Drive-ins in Buena Park and La Habra are closed for the season 
but scheduled to reopen later this year, said Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Hi-Way 39 Drive-In eventually closing was unsettling to some 
movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many shopping centers around already," said George Ross, 27, of 
Garden Grove. "Drive-ins are always good, and this one has to stay. I have a 
family, and this is the easiest way for us to go to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Bryski, 35, said, "It's very personal here at the drive-in. You can sit 
together and bring the kids. They can fall asleep, and if they act up, you can 
just roll up the windows and not bother anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
At $4.50 a head, Bob Briggs of Huntington Beach said, drive-ins are still the 
best bargain in town. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to see two movies for the price of one," said Briggs, 26. "I've been 
coming to this drive-in since I was 6 years old. I remember when it just had 
one screen. There was a time when I was coming here two times a week and knew 
just about all the employees. I would hate to see a place like this close down 
for something as ordinary as a shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach resident Julieanne Doan said she prefers a drive-in to a 
walk-in because she can just be herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I can relax, dress how I want, talk during the movie and smoke a cigarette and 
not have to worry about bothering anybody," said Doan, 19. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach resident Paula Andrews said she would be upset if her monthly 
trips to the drive-in came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last place," said Andrews, 29. "If they take this one away, we're 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody waxed sentimental about nights at the drive-in. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Busenburg, a snack bar attendant, said getting rid of the drive-in 
simply signals progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are starting to go to walk-ins more now anyway," said 
Busenburg, 17. "Drive-ins are becoming a thing of the past." GREG HERNANDEZ

CITY RESTRICTS AREA'S APARTMENT DENSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ and LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To reduce overcrowding in central city neighborhoods, the City Council has 
unanimously approved an amendment to the general plan restricting the building 
of high-density apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment reduces the number of apartment units allowed from 35 to 15 per 
acre in the city's downtown and Civic Center areas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our strategy to bring the quality of life back to our 
residential neighborhoods," said Mayor Daniel H. Young, referring to the 
council's passage of the general plan amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the city, developers have been limited for several years to seven 
apartment units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have blamed high-density development near the Civic Center and 
downtown for widespread parking problems, higher crime, and delays in fire and 
police responses to emergencies. For years, high-density complexes have been 
approved by the council, a move that Councilman Ron May says has come back to 
haunt the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's obvious that the sins of the past are now paying a visit to us," 
May said. "We allowed developers to come in and make a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
The new development restrictions were protested by five property owners who are 
seeking approval to build apartments in the downtown area. They asked the 
council to exempt them from the new rules, claiming they have spent thousands 
of dollars in architectural and building fees. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to refund up to $1,200 to each of the landowners for 
building and processing fees paid to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 apartment projects under way in the Civic Center and downtown area, 
officials said, only six will be allowed to proceed under the old, 
35-units-per-acre density rules. The rest will have to reduce the size of their 
projects to comply with the new law. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people can always apply for an amendment to the general plan and we can 
look at their projects on an individual basis. If they have merit, we will 
consider them," said Young. GREG HERNANDEZ and LILY ENG

ABORTION PLAN RUNS INTO DELAY; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNED PARENTHOOD: ORGANIZATION CAN'T FIND DOCTORS TO PERFORM THE SERVICES IT 
WANTS TO PROVIDE TO ITS CLIENTS.

Planned Parenthood, which three weeks ago announced plans to begin offering 
abortions in Orange County, cannot find a local physician to perform them and 
now has extended its search beyond the county's borders, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood plans to offer abortions, probably in its Santa Ana 
facility, as soon as the group's leaders are able to hire doctors to perform 
them. 
</P>
<P>
However, the organization has had difficulty finding local doctors to both 
perform abortions and provide prenatal care to expectant mothers, Margie Fites 
Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood in Orange County, said in an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that the new abortion service is not the sole reason for the 
difficult search. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a hard time finding physicians to do both services," Seigle said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in recruiting doctors is that physicians are reluctant to 
be regarded as representatives of a high-profile advocacy organization, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors basically become advocates when they work at Planned Parenthood. Not 
all physicians choose to be advocates," Seigle said. 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood's unsuccessful search does not mean that abortion services 
are becoming less available in Orange County, Seigle said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not heard of people having a problem in getting an abortion in Orange 
County. There are a number of clinics that provide them and a number of doctors 
who perform them in the county," Seigle said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for an anti-abortion organization took heart in Planned 
Parenthood's difficult search. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope their lack of success (in recruiting physicians) means that Orange 
County doctors respect life too much to be paid to kill unborn life," said Beth 
Cielnicky, president of Crusade for Life, an anti-abortion organization based 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman from Operation Rescue in Southern California, an anti-abortion 
activist group, said the organization has not heard of doctors in Orange County 
dropping abortion services because of protests. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, doctors may be less keen to perform abortions in light of highly 
visible protests by anti-abortion groups that have picketed clinics providing 
such a service, said Dr. Roger Schlesinger, president of the Obstetrics and 
Gynecology Society of Orange County. Schlesinger does not perform abortions in 
his own practice. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are concerned that if they perform abortions in clinics, they can 
potentially lose patients in their private practice, Schlesinger said. He added 
that doctors worry about how they will be viewed by patients or doctors with 
opposing views on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Performing abortions is alienating. It's not a procedure that is tasteful. You 
can't make a career out of doing abortions," Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent statistics gathered by the Alan Guttmacher 
Institute, which surveys clinics and hospitals in the United States that 
perform abortions, more than 30,000 abortions were performed in Orange County 
in 1985.

DESPITE MULLIGAN'S EFFORT, ANTEATER PROBLEMS PERSIST

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Mulligan has screamed at and insulted his players. He has made them watch 
game films until 2 a.m. after a loss on the road. He has also taken the soft 
approach, teaching and instructing in a patient manner. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, the basketball coach at UC Irvine, has used 12 starting lineups in 15 
games. He has changed the offense almost as many times, going from 
fast-breaking up-tempo to walk-it-up-slow-as-can-be, depending on the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
He has had his players work the ball inside for layups and he has instructed 
them to shoot three-pointers whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, Irvine has continued to lose games at a relentless, 
record-setting pace. 
</P>
<P>
With an 88-75 loss to New Mexico State last Saturday night, the Anteaters 
dropped to 2-13 overall and 0-6 in Big West Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think this could only happen to other people," Mulligan said. "This 
could never happen to me. But it has." 
</P>
<P>
In 34 seasons of coaching at Long Beach Poly High School, Riverside City 
College, Saddleback College and Irvine, Mulligan has never had a season quite 
like this one. 
</P>
<P>
In 23 seasons of college coaching, including the past 10 at Irvine, Mulligan 
has had only two losing teams, the most recent a 12-17 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Anteaters are setting records for futility at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Irvine's record is its worst at this point in the season in the 25-year 
history of Anteater basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With eight consecutive losses, Irvine is closing in on the school record of 
11, set in the 1979-80 season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Irvine hasn't won a Big West game since Feb. 18, 1989, a span of 10 
consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Anteaters' shooting percentages from the field and from the free-throw 
line are on a pace to set record lows. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters are ranked No. 219 among the 293 National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. Division I teams in USA Today's weekly computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real experience for me," Mulligan said. "I've tried not to let it 
affect my personality. I tried to not let it affect people around me." 
</P>
<P>
That would seem a task as daunting as defeating ninth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas 
at Thomas and Mack Center, which is what Irvine must do tonight to avoid its 
ninth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Never one to understate his feelings, Mulligan looks upbeat enough. 
</P>
<P>
After several especially tough losses, he has said the Anteaters are improving. 
His wit and biting humor are still as sharp as ever. 
</P>
<P>
But he also admits losing is tough to take. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan has often placed the blame for losing on his own shoulders, but he's 
been quick to rip into his players if he thinks they lack intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken the blame for some of these losses, but I'm not taking it for this 
one," he snapped after Irvine was beaten, 81-71, by Pepperdine in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're the weakest team in the league; We've got to make some 
adjustments," he said after a 75-69 loss to San Jose State this month. 
</P>
<P>
Atrocious shooting (42.1% from the field and 64.5% from the free-throw line), 
turnovers (18 a game) and the Anteaters' inability to maintain momentum for 40 
minutes have contributed mightly to their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The bad free-throw shooting has been a mystery to Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fifth in the nation (in free-throw shooting) one year and we never 
practiced them," Mulligan said. "Now, we run a drill called 'brass tomatoes' 
where we line up all 15 guys and shoot a free throw. If a guy misses, they all 
run." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of experience, with two seniors and three juniors among the 10 regulars, 
has not helped matters. 
</P>
<P>
Neither have injuries. Point guards Rod Palmer and Ben Rishwain were sidelined 
with a sprained knee and a broken index finger, respectively, in a 74-72 loss 
to Tennessee Chattanooga Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency has hurt, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get a consistent game from hardly anyone," Mulligan said. "We could 
have won all six (Big West) games. Every game was a four- or five-point game at 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start losing, the players think they're supposed to lose. I'm not 
saying they're not playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking down the Anteaters' losing mentality has proven to be tougher for 
Mulligan than revamping the Anteaters' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan's preparation and game plans have been as strong as ever. After 
beating Irvine Saturday night, New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy said, "I 
thought they were better prepared than anyone we've played this year (season)." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State's opponents have included New Mexico, Texas El Paso and UNLV, 
which the Aggies upset last week. 
</P>
<P>
The kind words are but small consolation for Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
After 34 seasons, is Mulligan feeling the pressure to win? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure people are saying, 'What the hell, he can't coach,' " said Mulligan. 
"The pressure to win is within yourself (not from what others are saying)." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, who will be 60 on Feb. 24., has one year remaining on his contract 
after this season and is optimistic about the Anteaters' future. Last week, he 
said he was "undecided" whether to apply for the vacant Irvine athletic 
director's job. 
</P>
<P>
The younger players, particularly freshmen Jeff Von Lutzow and Craig Marshall, 
have shown flashes of brilliance, albeit brief ones. 
</P>
<P>
On the bench sit twotalented redshirts, freshmen Khari Johnson and Rick 
Swanwick. Johnson, a 6-foot-6 forward, is a spectacular leaper and Swanwick, a 
6-10 center, could prove to be the best post player Mulligan has coached since 
Kevin Magee (1980-82). Both will become eligible next season. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Trabuco Hills High School, Swanwick led the Mustangs to the 
state Division III championship game last March, scoring all 25 of the 
Mustangs' second-half points in a 62-61 loss to Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan already has signed a promising newcomer for next season, Gabe Higa, a 
6-6 forward who has triple-jumped 50 feet for Quartz Hill High.

"I want to turn this around," Mulligan said. "I really think we can. If not 
this year, then next. Then if we can't, we'll see."

TRABUCO HILLS BLOWS BIG LEAD, THEN HANGS ON TO DEFEAT WOODBRIDGE 
</P>

<P>
Just when the Trabuco Hills boys' basketball team seemed to be in a desperate 
situation, it got some help from its Pacific Coast League opponent, Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, after blowing much of a 22-point, second-quarter lead, took 
advantage of a late technical foul and held on for a 78-72 victory at 
Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also set up a battle for sole possession of the league lead when 
Trabuco Hills (9-8 overall, 3-0 in league) travels to Laguna Beach Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, which took its biggest lead, 36-14, with about five minutes left 
in the second quarter, watched as Woodbridge (10-8, 2-1) cut the margin to six 
with about three minutes remaining on Joey Cohen's layup. To make matters worse 
for Trabuco Hills, Cohen was fouled on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, however, missed the free throw and teammate Ryan Rauch slipped in for 
the offensive rebound. Rauch missed the follow attempt, rebounded his miss and 
went up again. An official whistled Rauch for fouling Trabuco Hills' Kerry 
Kinkade on the second shot. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon said Rauch then said something to an official 
that resulted in a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Kinkade made both free throws and one of the technical shots to increase 
Trabuco Hills' lead to 69-60. The Mustangs then sealed the victory with four 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big call," Shannon said of Rauch's personal foul. "It's hard to 
explain how a guy can have inside position and get called for a foul." 
</P>
<P>
In other Pacific Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 74, Orange 48 -- Dain Blanton had 24 points and John Trevino had 
22 for visiting Laguna Beach (14-3, 3-0). Jason Lee had 12 points and seven 
rebounds for Orange (0-3, 6-10). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 67, Costa Mesa 51 -- Al Salbana scored 18 points and Todd Peterson 
17 to lead the Hawks (7-8, 1-2) at Laguna Hills. The Hawks trailed, 14-13, at 
the end of the first quarter but outscored the Mustangs, 23-15, to take a 36-29 
halftime lead and never trailed again. Brett Dieball scored 17 points for Costa 
Mesa (2-12, 0-3).

PARKS SCORES 19 IN FOURTH QUARTER TO LEAD MARINA PAST EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It took every inch of 6-foot-11 center Cherokee Parks' offensive ability to 
rally Marina High School to a 61-55 Sunset League victory over Edison Wednesday 
night at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Parks scored 19 points in the final quarter, including 11 consecutive free 
throws, to help Marina (11-7, 3-0) overcome a 13-point deficit to defeat Edison 
for the first time in three games this season. Edison had won two preseason 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Parks finished with 28 points, despite sitting out nearly four minutes in the 
third quarter when he got his fourth personal foul. He was 14 of 15 from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (13-5, 2-1) did an excellent job of containing Parks for three quarters 
with 6-10 center Bill Martineau and 6-5 forward Steve Thobe tag-teaming the 
junior center. But Thobe fouled out with 3:41 remaining to play and Martineau 
followed him to the bench about a minute later with his fifth foul and Parks 
broke loose in their absence. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is a lot more difficult when you have a 6-5 forward and a 6-9 center 
sitting on the bench with next with five fouls," said Jon Borchert, Edison 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Marina was badly beaten on the boards through three quarters and appeared to be 
hopelessly out of contention while Edison's front line of Brandon Jessie, Thobe 
and Martineau controlling the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie finished with 19 points and six rebounds, Thobe had 10 points and nine 
rebounds and Martineau added 15 points and 11 rebounds. But they were never a 
factor in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Parks tied the game, 48-48, with a three-point play with 3:41 remaining and 
then capped the turnaround by stealing a pass, dribbling the length of the 
court and scoring on a dunk for a 56-51 lead with 1:34 remaining. Afterward, 
Parks called the victory a momentum builder. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kind of games that pick you up and get you going," he said. "We 
don't match up very well with Edison. But as long as I established position, I 
was able to get a shot off." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Steve Popovich had watched his team in preseason lose to Edison in 
the championship game of the Santa Maria Tournament and in the third-place game 
of the Irvine World News Tournament. Popovich said he challenged his team at 
halftime to beat Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"We're were getting our butts kicked on the boards and didn't do a good job of 
getting the ball inside in the first half," Popovich said. "Martineau and Thobe 
killed us. But the players met the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 57, Westminster 55 -- Mike Merli made a jump shot in the middle 
of the key with three seconds remaining to lift host Fountain Valley (7-10, 
1-2). Merli had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the game. Eric Zellmer had 13 
points and Derrick Corcoran had 10 for Fountain Valley. Mark Murphy, Eden 
Yawata and Eric Wilkens each had 13 points for Westminster (5-10, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 87, Huntington Beach 67 -- Ryan Martin had 22 points and seven 
rebounds and Greg Evans had 15 points and seven rebounds to lead Ocean View 
(11-5, 3-0). Mustapha Abdi had 23 points for Huntington Beach (7-10, 0-3).

OVERTIME GOAL GIVES EDISON VICTORY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Harrigan scored in overtime to give Edison High School a 1-0 Sunset 
League boys' soccer victory over host Fountain Valley Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Harrigan scored one minute into the second 10-minute overtime period after 
Fountain Valley goalkeeper Joe Penaflor knocked down a hard shot by Tim Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew (Penaflor) was going to be tough to beat," Edison Coach Mike 
DiGiovanni said. "He's won some games for them. He got his head on the first 
one and luckily enough we were there for the follow up." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (10-4-2 overall, 2-1 in league) kept the ball in Fountain Valley 
territory most of the second half but couldn't break through against Penaflor 
or the Fountain Valley defense, which hadn't allowed a goal in Sunset League 
play. Penaflor, who has nine shutouts this season, finished with 10 saves for 
the Barons (12-2-3, 1-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Fountain Valley outshot Edison, 6-1, to set the pace. In the 
final 15 minutes of the half, the Barons had a number of good scoring 
opportunities, including a Bryan Kojima head shot off a corner kick that barely 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
But Fountain Valley's offense wilted in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking too much from our defense," Fountain Valley Coach Cameron Beaulac 
said. "That's the first goal we've given up in the past four games. Our 
forwards have only scored one goal for me in the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the best defense in the league, but if you don't score goals, 
you don't win games." 
</P>
<P>
In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 4, Westminster 1 -- Jed Smith scored two goals, both in the first 
half, to lead the Seahawks (10-3-3, 2-0-1) at Westminster. Todd Johnson and 
Jason Merkel also scored for Ocean View, which plays first-place Marina on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Century League: 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 2, Canyon 2 -- Brian Rice and Eric Sukuda scored for Foothill (15-2-2, 
2-0-1) and Randy Campbell and Danny Thomas scored for visiting Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 2, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Marc Gonzales and Mike Glaspey scored for El 
Modena (6-2-3, 1-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the Empire League:

<P>
Katella 2, Esperanza 2 -- Armando Orizaba and Brian Schenk scored for Katella 
(8-5-4) and Jason Wheeler and Jason De Lucca scored for host Esperanza (11-2-4, 
3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>

Noetzel scored one as visiting Pacifica rallied from a 2-1 deficit.

DEAL ON HOTELS SEEN AS PROGRESS IN SOVIET TRAVEL

<P>
When the fall semester ended last month, Cal State Fullerton professor Robert 
S. Feldman boarded a flight for Leningrad so hastily that he had to grade final 
examinations as he crossed the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, director of the university's Russian and East European Area Studies 
program, said the quick exit was worth the trouble. He sealed a deal for his 
small Placentia travel company that he said makes him the first American to 
deal directly for rooms at hotels in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, Feldman said, he will book the tour groups he leads to 
the Soviet Union directly into the Leningrad Hotel or the Yalta Hotel, instead 
of having to make arrangements through Intourist, the national tourist office. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman's deal is significant because he believes it marks the first time a 
small U.S. travel company has signed a contract for reservations with major 
Soviet hotels. 
</P>
<P>
And he said it will allow him, as a small tour operator, to deal directly for 
hotel space that might normally be unavailable, except to large outfits. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get (hotel rooms) through Intourist unless I was a great big tour 
operator," he said. "Space is at a premium in Soviet hotels, especially in the 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Feldman said, booking directly with the hotels and getting to know 
their staff members should mean better service for his groups. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Feldman will arrange tours of the United States for staff 
members of the two Soviet hotels. A key part of the tours will be visits to 
hotel management schools so the Soviet visitors can see how U.S. hotels are 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman is president of East-West International Tours Inc., a private tour 
company not affiliated with the university. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian-speaking Feldman said he was introduced to the tour business in 
1978 after a neighbor who knew of his expertise in Soviet studies urged him to 
lead a sightseeing and cultural trip to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Much to his surprise, Feldman said, he enjoyed shepherding a pack of tourists 
through major Soviet cities and some of the nation's far-flung republics. But 
for the next few years, campus responsibilities kept him from developing a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
When campus duties lightened, Feldman said, he started his agency in 1984. He 
has led about a dozen tour groups so far. During those visits he has developed 
business relationships with Soviet hotel officials that blossomed with the 
coming of perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Business has expanded so much that Feldman said he will take a leave of absence 
from the university for a year to work on a book of readings about Gorbachev 
and his policies and to expand his tour business. 
</P>
<P>
As for his end of the deal, Feldman said, he is planning to lead Leningrad 
Hotel staff members in September for a tour of New York, Washington and the 
hotel school at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
While details are being worked out, he also hopes a group from the Yalta Hotel 
can tour Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and stop off at the hotel school at the 
University of Nevada-Las Vegas in November.

BANKRUPTCY PLAN POINTS TO SALE OF J.M. PETERS STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A bankruptcy reorganization plan filed Wednesday by Southmark Corp. appears to 
give the Dallas real estate and financial services concern new impetus to sell 
its majority stake in J.M. Peters Co., the Newport Beach residential builder. 
</P>
<P>
The plan does not specifically address the disposition of the 87% share of J.M. 
Peters owned by Southmark's thrift subsidiary, San Jacinto Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But it does call for Southmark to keep the thrift while selling most of its 
other assets to pay off creditors and raise up to $100 million in cash to pump 
up the ailing thrift's capital. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto has about $4 billion in assets and accounts for about 70% of 
Southmark's total assets. One of San Jacinto's prime assets is its 12 million 
shares of J.M. Peters stock, which has a current market value of about $120 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at San Jacinto and Southmark could not be reached for comment. And 
Brian Theriot, investor relations director for J.M. Peters, said the company 
would have no comment. An unusual agreement reached between Southmark and the 
federal Office of Thrift Supervision would let Southmark keep San Jacinto 
Savings after boosting its capital by $210 million, including $100 million in 
cash and property.

AMERICANS GO ABROAD FOR ADOPTION; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: MORE WOULD-BE PARENTS ARE TAKING IN FOREIGN-BORN CHILDREN, PRIMARILY 
BECAUSE OF THEIR AVAILABILITY. THE OBSTACLES HOWEVER, CAN BE GREAT. 
</P>

<P>
By now, Hemlata Momaya can recognize the look in an instant. It is an 
expression of past disappointment and desperation on the faces of would-be 
adoptive parents, mixed with the smallest glimmer of hope. 
</P>
<P>
"After having spent years with their names on a waiting list, watching 
repeatedly as apparent sure-things fall through or discovering that the odds of 
their adopting a healthy child are next to nothing, many of them are very 
hesitant to let their hopes rise one more time," said Momaya, director of Bal 
Jagad Childrens World, a licensed private adoption agency in Chatsworth that 
helps arrange about 20 adoptions each year from India, Chile, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, the Philippines and several other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"But I tell them that there are children all over the world who need homes," 
she said. "Usually, these people are so anxious for a child that they say they 
will take a child from any country." 
</P>
<P>
The attitude is not difficult to understand. Between 1971 and 1982, the last 
year for which statistics were available, the number of adoptions between 
unrelated people in the United States declined 38%, according to the National 
Committee for Adoption, an association of 130 private adoption agencies. That 
decline has been attributed to a fewer number of available children -- 
principally because of increased abortions, wider use of contraceptives and the 
decreased stigma among unwed parents. 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, the number of foreign-born children adopted in the United 
States has increased. In 1981, 4,868 children were adopted from other 
countries; in 1986, that number had risen to 6,188. Of those, nearly two-thirds 
came from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the obstacles to adopting foreign-born children can seem just as 
great, but at least the children are out there," said Linda Nunez, a Tustin 
attorney who specializes in adoption. Nunez has adopted four children, one of 
whom is from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The decreased availability of children in this country, though, may not be the 
only motivating factor for some prospective parents to look outside the borders 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people say they don't want to adopt American children because they are 
born from drug-addicted parents. Also, here the birth mothers have a right to 
change their minds during the first six months," Momaya said. "I have had many 
couples that had tried to adopt through the county and had a child for nearly 
six months, and then the mother wanted the child back. That's a horrible thing 
to have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Esfahani, a 34-year-old psychiatric nurse who lives in Northridge, said 
she decided to adopt a child after her marriage broke up and her two closest 
relatives died within a few months of each other. Her marital status, though, 
limited her chances of adopting a U.S. born child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that unless I was willing to take a handicapped or mentally 
deficient child, or one who had been through numerous foster homes, I could 
pretty much forget it," she said. "I didn't care about the child's race, but I 
didn't want one that had been emotionally scarred. I'm already a psychiatric 
nurse, and what I wanted to be was a mom." 
</P>
<P>
Esfahani began her search by writing to several private agencies throughout the 
country. From their replies, she said, she learned that different countries 
imposed different restrictions on prospective parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some countries wouldn't consider me because of my marital status, others 
because I'm not Catholic, and there also are some age requirements," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months of contacting the Bal Jagad agency, Esfahani said she was 
notified about a child in Peru. Not long afterward, after informing her 
employers that she was "going to have a baby and would be back in a few weeks," 
she was on a plane to Lima. On arrival, she said, there were 14 other American 
couples and singles who also had come to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks later, in October, 19888, Esfahani was on a plane headed back to Los 
Angeles, this time with her 2-month-old Peruvian Indian daughter in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very lucky," she said. "Many of the children there are given up for 
adoption because of poverty, and many of them are malnourished. But Jordana had 
chubby little cheeks and was very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Esfahani has found another reason to be grateful. She recently 
adopted a second child, a healthy baby boy from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Not all foreign adoptions go as smoothly, however. 
</P>
<P>
"In any intercountry adoption, the adoptive parents are at the mercy of the 
child's government," Nunez said. "I've heard of people falling in love with a 
child in a foreign country, having to come back to the U.S. without the child 
and then not being able to get the child because of some political situation 
that has developed," she said. "It's not an uncommon thing to have happen." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case with several U.S. couples who had met and then set their 
hearts on adopting children in Romania. In recent years, the difficult living 
conditions in that country had forced many women to send their children to live 
in orphanages, which had made Romania an important source for childless couples 
in several countries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, however, Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu abruptly refused to grant 
passports to more than 250 orphans waiting to be adopted by foreigners. It is 
only now, since the dictator's fall, that American couples have experienced 
renewed hope about their chances of adopting those children. 
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of adoption, a child is classified as an orphan by immigration 
officials in their country if both parents are no longer living, or if a single 
woman gives birth who cannot afford to raise the child, according to Judith 
Chen Haggerty, an attorney in the City of Industry who specializes in foreign 
adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
There are other potential problems as well. Bonnie Beall, an administrator with 
Hughes Aircraft in Los Angeles, said she worked with two different agencies 
over a four-year period and still had been unable to adopt a foreign-born 
child. Six referrals for children in different countries had all fallen 
through, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They wasted my time, my energy and my emotions," said Beall, who said she 
spent $8,000 that was non-refundable. "The second agency had a small staff and 
small budget, and I think they were overextended. Toward the end, they wouldn't 
even return my phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Momaya said, a cash advance of about $7,000 must be paid by 
would-be parents to foreign attorneys. The fee for a home study -- conducted by 
agencies in all cases of adoption to determine the suitability of each 
prospective parent's living environment and financial situation -- are 
non-refundable. Although the total cost for a foreign adoption generally costs 
a minimum of $10,000, Momaya said, a prolonged stay in a foreign country can 
increase that amount significantly. 
</P>
<P>
After moving from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles, Beall, who is single, 
decided to give it one last try. Ten months after contacting the Bal Jagad 
agency, her son, Joshua, arrived with an escort from India at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival, though, was not what she had expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned, because he looked dreadful," she said. "He was 11 weeks old and 
weighed five pounds. I had said I would accept a low birth-weight child, 
because many of the children in India are born prematurely. But he was dying." 
</P>
<P>
Joshua spent the next three weeks in a neonatal intensive-care unit, Beall 
said, and later made what doctors called a miraculous recovery. He is now 3 and 
"incredibly healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the complex laws and procedures required for foreign adoptions, 
attorneys caution people from making any hasty moves on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times people will hear about a child in Mexico or Korea or wherever 
through a friend of a friend, and then they'll just hop on a plane and go down 
there and stumble around," Nunez said. "It's heartbreaking, not to mention very 
expensive, when it doesn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
For Luis Menendez, an unmarried real estate agent who lives in Laguna Niguel, 
adopting an infant girl from Peru last year gave him a sense of security he had 
never known before. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, who is from Cuba, said he had been in and out of relationships and 
still felt no closer to having a child of his own. He also had watched friends 
get divorced and then struggle emotionally when their ex-wives moved away to 
other states with their children. He didn't want it to happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I decided to be a father on my own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither the agency that conducted the home study nor officials in Peru 
had ever dealt with a single man wishing to adopt a child, Menendez said he was 
warmly -- albeit perhaps a bit skeptically -- received. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's eyes down in Peru were really big, because Latin men don't do 
things like that. Everyone wanted to look at me. And when I showed up in front 
of the judge with the baby, I knew he was looking at me like, 'Can this man 
really take care of this child?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I decided to change her diaper," he said, laughing. "She didn't 
need a change, but it seemed like the proper time to do it."

POP BEAT: ORANGE COUNTY UNKNOWNS GET TOGETHER FOR CD; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: 10 OF THE 16 UNSIGNED ROCK AND POP PERFORMERS SHOWCASED ON THE 'CO-OP' 
RELEASE WILL APPEAR ON STAGE TONIGHT IN LONG BEACH. THEY REPRESENT WIDELY 
VARIED STYLES.

<P>
It has been said that each rock or pop band has the talent to write at least 
one good song. It has also been said that, when it comes to doing business, 
it's a rare musician who has any talent at all. 
</P>
<P>
"CO-OP," a compact disc showcasing the work of 16 unsigned rock and pop 
performers -- most of them from Orange County -- pretty much bears out the 
first truism. Its main intent is to compensate for the second. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the "CO-OP" performers will play tonight at Bogart's in Long Beach, in a 
special concert celebrating the disc's release. Musically, these acts have 
little in common. But their situation within the music business is the same: 
Each has no record contract and no certain means of getting the attention of 
record companies and radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind "CO-OP" is to improve each member's chances of getting a fair 
hearing by pooling resources. Usually, bands cast their hooks into the music 
industry's inhospitable ocean by sending unsolicited tapes to radio stations, 
record companies and music publications. Then they sit back and hope for a 
bite. "CO-OP," in essence, makes the bait bigger, shinier, more attractive, 
harder to ignore and casts it in a wider arc than most aspiring bands could 
manage individually. 
</P>
<P>
The CD, which is not available for purchase, is a well-packaged compilation in 
which each performer is represented by one or two songs. The album notes 
contain photos and thumbnail information on each act involved, as well as their 
address and phone number. Since October, "CO-OP" has been sent to about 500 
college radio stations (college radio being the only outlet remaining in the 
United States where grass-roots bands not signed to a major label can get a 
hearing). Major labels also received copies, and so have some music publishing 
companies (who listen with an ear for songwriting ability, rather than 
performance talent) and music writers. 
</P>
<P>
The force behind "CO-OP" is Exude, an Anaheim dance-rock band that has 
developed some business savvy during a 10-year career full of ups and downs, in 
which the band has confronted setbacks with scrappy persistence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Exude was about to send copies of a self-produced album, "Play With 
the Boys," to radio stations around the country. Then it got a bright idea: Why 
not split the mailing costs with other unsigned bands looking to reach the same 
outlets? The first CO-OP project was simple enough -- packages went out 
containing Exude's album, as well as LPs by four other unsigned bands willing 
to share the cost. 
</P>
<P>
According to Exude's singer, Frank Rogala, that first CO-OP mailing had its 
problems. Some of the bands packaged their releases haphazardly, leaving out 
such basic information as a contact phone number. 
</P>
<P>
Rogala said Exude got the idea for a cooperative CD in 1988, after it achieved 
its career high-water mark to date: inclusion on a Musician magazine CD 
compilation of the best unsigned bands in the country, as determined by such 
judges as Elvis Costello, Mark Knopfler, T-Bone Burnett and Mitchell Froom, who 
were commissioned by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in spring, 1989, Exude began advertising for interested unsigned bands 
to join it in another "CO-OP" release, this time with the packaging carefully 
thought out and some extra promotional push by the Jensen Crew, a public 
relations firm that has worked with Exude in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of producing and mailing the CD was about $7,000, Rogala said. Each 
band paid $285 per song. When expenses overshot the original $5,000 budget, 
Exude kicked in an extra $2,000 to see the project through to completion, 
Rogala said. (Exude also enclosed a new full-length CD album of its own, 
"Testosterone Tapdance," with the "CO-OP" mailing.) 
</P>
<P>
Rogala said radio stations have been returning cards enclosed with the "CO-OP" 
CD, indicating that it has been getting some college airplay. The project has 
also gained Exude a nibble from one major label that was interested in its own 
entry on the "CO-OP" disc, "Get Your Meat." 
</P>
<P>
For others represented on the disc, at the very least "CO-OP" has provided a 
classy way to approach the record and radio industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been very weak at that," said Beth Fitchet, whose song, "Repay," 
is the finest of the 19 tracks on the disc. Fitchet and her husband, Steve 
Wood, are both alumni of Honk, an Orange County band that had a major label 
recording career in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always concentrated on playing my music, and I'm terrible at marketing," 
Fitchet said. "Both Steve and I really don't know how to do that, and this was 
an opportunity to pay a little money and have somebody else be our promoter for 
us. Maybe somebody will perk up their ears and like it." 
</P>
<P>
The styles on "CO-OP" range from the adult-pop of Fitchet and Wood to pacifist 
protest rock from Salt, a Los Angeles band, to the snappy, sardonic punk-pop of 
Mission Viejo's Poodles Must Die. 
</P>
<P>
The show tonight at Bogart's offers a chance to hear many of the songs and 
performers from the album. In order of appearance, Carol Martini, Salt, George 
Lawton, Ted Waterhouse, The Girls (Fitchet's vocal group), John Walker and 
X-Factor will play short sets, followed by longer sets from Exude, the 
Tearjerkers and Them Lonesome Tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Rogala said, is to lend the "CO-OP" project an enjoyable, public 
dimension, instead of having it remain strictly a business proposition directed 
at radio and the music industry. "I want to have something a little more 
casual, a little more fun," he said. "If the industry people we've invited want 
to come, fine. But this is kind of a celebration." 
</P>
<P>
CO-OP's CD release party takes place tonight at 8:30 at Bogart's, 6288 E. 
Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, in the Marina Pacifica Mall. Tickets: $5. 
Information: (213) 594-8975. 
</P>
<P>
SEND HIM FORGET-ME-NOTS: James Harman had a couple of unusual experiences last 
Friday at the Belly Up in Solana Beach -- one enjoyable, one not so pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
The not-so-pleasant moment came before the show, when Harman realized that, for 
the first time in 30 years of playing the blues, he had showed up for a gig 
without bringing his harmonica and the special 1940s-vintage microphone he uses 
on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I start down the driveway (on the way to a show), I stop, just to 
make sure my harp's there," Harman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, hurrying out of his house on the way to some pre-concert 
business meetings, "I left it covered up with paper work," he said. "Thirty 
years, and it finally happened." 
</P>
<P>
Harman got through the show with borrowed equipment, then resolved to operate 
from now on with two sets of harmonicas and microphones -- one to keep at home, 
and another to keep in his band's equipment truck, in case he should forget 
again. 
</P>
<P>
On a more pleasant note, Harman and Walter Trout, two of the finest blues-rock 
talents in Orange County, marked a reconciliation at the Belly Up after many 
years of awkward, stand-offish relations. Trout's band opened for the James 
Harman Band, the first time the two players had shared a stage since some 
late-'70s jam sessions at a small club in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Trout recalled Tuesday that he relocated from New Jersey to Orange County in 
1973 with the specific aim of overwhelming Harman with his guitar ability and 
winning a spot in the Icehouse Blues Band, Harman's band at the time. But 
Harman was not impressed by Trout's prolific, fast-flurrying style. Trout did 
not suffer the rejection lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through some times where we were sort of like enemies -- there was bad 
blood between us," Trout said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harman and Trout both live in Huntington Beach, they had not been in 
contact for more than 10 years. But a few weeks ago, Trout said, Harman called 
him up to congratulate him on the release of his first album, "Life in the 
Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
"I was really moved" by Harman's kind words, Trout said. "I thought, 'This is 
great, we can re-establish our friendship.' I've always had nothing but respect 
for the guy. I've known him a long time, and that bad blood between us was 
childish. It's good to be his friend again." 
</P>
<P>
Trout said that his album, released only in Scandinavia, has done well in 
Europe but that U.S. labels have been cool toward it because of a stylistic mix 
that veers among traditional blues, pop-flavored ballads and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"The blues purist labels are staying away from it (because of the rock songs), 
and the other labels are staying away from it because there are blues on it," 
Trout said. "It's like Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
Trout's solution will be to develop a U.S. following with live shows. Next 
month he'll play shows in New Orleans and along the East Coast, his first U.S. 
tour since he left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in spring, 1989. Then Trout will 
head to Europe for further touring. 
</P>
<P>
Opening Saturday at the Coach House for his old boss, Mayall, Trout showed in a 
passionate, fiercely energetic set that he and his band should have no problem 
winning an audience on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Walter Trout Band will play at its home club, Perq's in Huntington Beach, 
on Sunday, with weekend stands coming up at Perq's Jan. 25-28 and Feb. 1-4 
before it leaves on tour. 
</P>
<P>
The James Harman Band will headline Jan. 27 at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
ODD COUPLE: Mark Feb. 9 and 10 on your calendar if you like interesting musical 
contrasts. Headlining at the Coach House on the 9th and at Bogart's on the 10th 
is Dick Dale, the surf guitar king who recently reverted to playing in a raw, 
power-trio format after years of performing with horn-driven show bands. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's trio approach was nothing less than exhilarating in his recent 
appearance at the Orange County Music for the Needy benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Opening both nights will be Jonathan Richman, a one-of-a-kind solo performer 
whose songs and showmanship are full of gentle whimsy. Richman asked to be 
included on the bills with Dale, according to Coach House booking agent Ken 
Phebus. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent song called "Fender Stratocaster," Richman sings the praises of the 
very instrument that Dale helped popularize during the surf rock craze of the 
early 1960s -- so there are some grounds for mutuality here. What would 
Richman's classic Bostonian rock rave-up, "Roadrunner," sound like with Dale 
drenching it in reverberating waves of Southern California surf guitar? It 
would sure be fun to find out.

JOSEPH N. BELL: THE MAIL ROLLS IN: KFAC TO MISSOURI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The columns that draw the most mail never fail to surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the arrogances of columnists that we tend to believe that the 
things that agitate us the most are mirrored by those who read the column. And, 
of course, that often isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
It has been some months since I dealt with letters here, and during that span 
the three columns that drew the most mail were: the demise of KFAC, my 
homecoming visit to the University of Missouri and the narrative of a World War 
II experience that led me to an advertisement in the Nov. 22, 1941, New Yorker 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
What the KFAC mail told me is that someone is missing a bet by not starting a 
classical music station -- or converting an existing one -- in Orange County. 
The audience is large and remarkably faithful. As Elizabeth Thacker of Mission 
Viejo wrote: "KFAC's classical music programs enriched and saved my life. Over 
and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Mae Lambrinch of Huntington Beach noted, "Isn't it ironic that the 
ever-improving quality available in tapes and discs is mostly used for 
mind-shattering, all-sound-alike rock 'n' roll?" 
</P>
<P>
And Rachel May of Santa Ana wrote: "What can we do to get a good classical 
music station back on the air? I am willing to pay a modest amount of money, as 
I'm sure many classical music lovers might also. I would guess the demographics 
of classical music lovers would show them to be a smallish but potentially 
lucrative segment of the population for advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
Are any Orange County entrepreneurs out there listening? 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri mail confirmed something I had only suspected: that all of Orange 
County didn't go to USC. Or claim to. 
</P>
<P>
A quite remarkable number of Missouri alums surfaced to share their own 
nostalgia trips with me. Typical was Charles Murry of Huntington Beach, who 
wrote that the ancient brick buildings of the Missouri campus "provide a tonic 
for the soul which the completely functional structures put up since World War 
II on all campuses cannot even approach." 
</P>
<P>
The column about the New Yorker advertisement that ran two weeks before the 
attack on Pearl Harbor and appeared to signal that attack to someone received 
the biggest response. 
</P>
<P>
A large ad and smaller ads inside the issue referred to a game board named "The 
Deadly Double" that was seemingly manufactured by a company that the 
intelligence community later found didn't exist. Eerily, two dice showed the 
numbers 12 and 7, neither of which is found on standard dice. 
</P>
<P>
National Public Radio interviewed me and used a rather sizable segment of the 
interview on the air (in which -- by adroit editing -- they managed to expunge 
every mention of The Times). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mail was fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Marine Corps Capt. Louis Bushnell of Santa Ana, for example, enclosed a 
copy of an ad that appeared a few days before the attack in the Honolulu 
Advertiser. (Bushnell was born and raised in that city.) 
</P>
<P>
It takes a considerable stretch of the imagination to read subversive messages 
into this ad of a silk importing company, but Naval Intelligence apparently 
gave it a great deal of attention before dismissing it. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Preston, a former advertising man who now lives in Huntington Beach, 
completed an intriguingly detailed analysis of questions raised by the New 
Yorker ad. For example, how were the seven teaser ads placed so precisely, how 
did the advertiser get island treatment for his one-column ad, why didn't Naval 
Intelligence follow up on the source of the artwork or typography, both of 
which carry distinctive stamps? That sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
Preston sent the ad and his letter to nine "much-above-average thinkers" 
(including a mystery writer) and asked them to comment on the puzzle. He has 
promised to deliver the results to me. 
</P>
<P>
The most frustrating mail to report on are the long, thoughtful letters that 
are difficult to excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
I've had two such letters from Ray Bracy of Tustin, the most recent on the 
names of special-interest groups. He concluded: "The voters of Irvine . . . 
have told the world that they believe it is quite all right to have a group of 
second-class citizens. Now, if we can just get those subversives out of the 
schools. . . . You were accurate in calling it McCarthyism brought up to date. 
So where is our Joe Welsh?" 
</P>
<P>
And Sheldon Karlan of Buena Park wrote how in his view the growth of individual 
freedom "has become equated with (moral) decadence," supporting his thesis with 
half a dozen specific examples. 
</P>
<P>
Both letters merit longer treatment than I can give here and will be held as 
the possible subjects of future columns. 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there are the zingers. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hartman of Cypress wrote: "You must be the slob that sits around the TV 
laughing at such off-color shows as 'Married With Children.' You know, just a 
'wide variety of people doing a wide variety of things.' I'll still take a 
little Republican intolerance any day compared to the barnyard society you seem 
to espouse." 
</P>
<P>
And a correspondent who identifies himself only as "Jim" wrote: "Please stop 
trying to protect my civil rights! Myself and many respectable friends have 
functioned well because we know how to act in society. I don't need your 
crusading to tell me what I can and cannot do. You have absolutely no idea what 
the life style of the average gay is outside of Orange County. . . . I feel 
patronized in a way that a black person would when the white liberal admits he 
knows how it is to be black." 
</P>
<P>
Jim thoughtfully told me I could respond in my column, but I'm not sure what 
I'm being accused of here. Offhand, I don't know any white liberals who make 
such claims. We just have this funny feeling that everyone ought to have the 
same rights, including Jim. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the phone calls. I received one the other day from Irmalee 
Desenberg of Corona del Mar, who wants the world to know that good Samaritans 
aren't an extinct breed, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Irmalee and her husband, Bud, were headed for a reunion at Stanford University 
over the holidays when Irmalee went to sleep at the wheel and their car 
miraculously crossed four lanes of opposing traffic on Interstate 5 near 
Bakersfield and turned over. 
</P>
<P>
Even more miraculously, neither of the Desenbergs was badly hurt, but the 
experience was made much less shattering by a young man who stopped immediately 
after the accident and stayed with them throughout the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
He loaded all their possessions in his car, followed the ambulance to the 
hospital, stayed until they were pronounced OK and released, and then drove 
them to Stanford, although he was going only to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Frank Drolep, he works in the Ontario Fire Department, and he's 
unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to find him a good wife," Irmalee said. "It's the least I can do."

EFFECTIVELY STRETCHING YOUR FITNESS DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVE BELSON, Eve Belson is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
January is traditionally the month people vow to get in shape, but unless 
you're planning a program of push-ups in the morning, deep knee bends at noon 
and power walks in the evening, getting fit is going to cost you money. 
</P>
<P>
Before you pull out the credit cards, make sure you have done your homework. 
</P>
<P>
As with everything else, low price does not necessarily mean good value when it 
comes to fitness. Cost is certainly a factor, but if your investment gets you 
in shape and keeps you there, then the price was right. 
</P>
<P>
Zero in on what will work best for you by asking yourself what types of 
activities appeal to you, when you plan to work out, how much time you have to 
spare, and what will work for you emotionally (this is the key to avoiding 
expensive mistakes). 
</P>
<P>
If you are the competitive type, you will never find aerobics fulfilling. And 
if you are a social creature, there is no point in buying a rowing machine for 
your bedroom just because it's on sale. 
</P>
<P>
Ask friends and experts for advice, but make the final decision yourself. 
</P>
<P>
When joining a health club, consider price, convenience and financial 
stability. (Will the doors be open next week?) 
</P>
<P>
Start with convenience when whittling down your options. No bargain is worth a 
long drive. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America, three to five miles 
seems to be the optimal driving distance for maximum adherence to a fitness 
program at a health club. 
</P>
<P>
Convenience and price often go together: the more amenities the club offers, 
the more you will pay in dues. Initial membership fees can range from under $50 
to more than $1,000, and monthly dues vary from $15 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
While you may not be interested in underwriting such fringe benefits as marble 
lobbies, vaulted ceilings and valet parking, there are certain features offered 
by higher-priced gyms that you may find cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
A snack bar, for example, is convenient for busy people who have to work out 
and grab a bite on the run. And young mothers find that the child-care services 
at their gyms are often more convenient and less expensive than hiring a 
baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how frothy the whirlpool looks, ask yourself seriously if you 
will ever take time to use it. Or the on-site dietitian, for that matter. Or 
the racquetball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Does the club have rules and regulations? Look them over to see if they seem 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
If you travel often, you will maximize your membership dues if you join a 
health club that has a chain of affiliations or that has reciprocal membership 
arrangements with other spas. No sign-up special is worth it if you only use 
the facility once a month. 
</P>
<P>
January may be "specials" month, but don't panic. There are specials all year 
long, so take your time and make the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs are constantly signing up new members. Ask how they will all fit 
in, and what this will mean to your enjoyment of the club. 
</P>
<P>
There are no ceilings placed on memberships at fitness clubs. On average, clubs 
experience a 60% to 75% falloff on all one-year memberships, which means they 
are continually looking to replenish lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Many clubs in the middle price range use the same techniques as car salesmen to 
pressure you into buying a membership. If they refuse to quote a price over the 
phone, head on down and sharpen your negotiating pencil because you can use the 
situation to your advantage. One salesman dropped his club's dues from $299 to 
$199 to $99 in less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
You know you are in a strong bargaining position when you hear either of these 
lines: "let me ask the manager" and "the dues will be going up, but we haven't 
been told how much." 
</P>
<P>
If you are concerned about overcrowding at peak hour, find a club that offers 
specially priced off-peak memberships as an incentive for people to come during 
slow times. Those clubs tend to have less crowded peak times. Visit the club at 
the time you expect to be working out to witness the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
The frequent rate of club closures in the early and middle '80s that left 
members unable to collect refunds seems to be abating, according to Dudley 
Exstrom of American Service Finance, a Colorado-based company specializing in 
health club finances. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely seeing a trend of people considering health clubs a serious 
business rather than a way to get rich quick and leave," Exstrom said. "Clubs 
are starting to price their memberships according to what they need to charge 
to stay in business. In the long run it will work out better for the public." 
</P>
<P>
A club offering rock-bottom sign-up prices may be discounting heavily because 
the owners desperately need members. Although some protections for consumers 
have been legislated at the state level, you are still on your own in judging a 
club's future. 
</P>
<P>
Ask tough questions: What happens if there is a change of ownership? Is your 
membership transferable if you move or refundable if you are disabled? Your 
rights and obligations should be clearly spelled out in writing when you sign 
the membership application. 
</P>
<P>
What is the club's reputation? How long has it been in business under the same 
management? Contact the Better Business Bureau to see if there have been 
complaints about the club. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, make sure you like the club. Is it well-maintained? Is the staff 
helpful? The members happy? 
</P>
<P>
Realize, however, that health clubs don't fit everyone's life style. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I joined a health club I would go two or three times and then not 
go again," said Bruce Amspacher, a Lake Forest coin dealer who runs his own 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"What with driving there, changing, working out, showering and driving back, a 
one-hour workout generally takes 2 1/2 to three hours of your time. That time 
just wasn't available to me." 
</P>
<P>
Amspacher solved his problem by hiring a personal trainer who comes to his 
office three times a week and gives him a one-hour workout at his convenience. 
</P>
<P>
They may be expensive (fees vary from $25 to $200 an hour), but good personal 
trainers make every fitness dollar -- and every workout -- count. 
</P>
<P>
There is no standard qualification for trainers, so check each one out 
thoroughly. Call a couple of their clients. If you have special problems such 
as high blood pressure or back pain, ask your specialist to recommend someone 
knowledgeable in those fields. Injury prevention is worth the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
Establish the price up front. Find out if you will need to buy equipment and 
how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
Does the trainer really focus in on what you want to achieve -- whether losing 
weight, building muscle or firming up -- and explain exactly how you can 
accomplish your goal? Avoid the one-program-fits-all sell. 
</P>
<P>
Before you commit to a long-term contract, arrange for a half dozen or so trial 
workouts to see if you have "chemistry." Do your personalities click? Is he or 
she judgmental if you can't complete an exercise? 
</P>
<P>
A good trainer provides motivation and immediate advice, and a sense of humor 
scores 100 bonus points. 
</P>
<P>
Punctuality is also crucial -- remember, those are your dollars ticking away. 
</P>
<P>
More people are finding that the only way they can make time to exercise is by 
working out at home. Some have invested in complete gyms, others have opted for 
$12 workout videos. 
</P>
<P>
What separates those whose exercise accessories are dust-collectors from those 
who use their equipment regularly is a firm exercise schedule. Think of your 
home as Sabotage Central. With distractions galore and no pressing need to do 
it now, you are constantly putting off exercising. Hey, the equipment isn't 
going anywhere, is it? 
</P>
<P>
If you commit to working out at home, do it at a specific time each day, even 
if you have to bribe your family to lock you in the bedroom with your 
treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
If you resent every second you are not doing something else, become a "twofer" 
-- put on your workout video and jump with your children, watch the news while 
rowing or catch up on light reading on your stationary bike. 
</P>
<P>
The new generation of high-tech home fitness equipment ranges from 
stair-climbing devices to cross-country skiing machines. Treadmills -- once the 
very metaphor of life's drudgery -- are popular, and stationary bicycles come 
with built-in motivators such as digital readouts of the number of calories you 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Good equipment is expensive. Don't indulge in impulse buying. 
</P>
<P>
Never buy a piece of equipment without testing it first. Does it feel solid, 
smooth? Do you enjoy the workout? Will it fit into the room? Will you be able 
to read or watch TV while using it? Will you be able to hear the TV while using 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself specific questions about what you want out of your home equipment. 
Do you want to lose weight? Build bulk? Tone muscle? 
</P>
<P>
Most fitness stores can provide you with expert advice, but if you suspect that 
salespeople are natural predators, hire an objective fitness expert to help you 
make the right decisions. Make sure you understand exactly how to use the 
equipment before you leave the store. 
</P>
<P>
Setting a realistic budget can get tricky. Cost effectiveness (are you going to 
use it?) is more important than cost alone. 
</P>
<P>
"People are too concerned with price," says Mark Goodman, manager of Busybody 
Inc., a fitness equipment store in Orange. "They will buy a piece of garbage at 
a sporting goods store which they will never use because it's noisy, it 
rattles, it's jerky, it squeaks and it drives everyone in the house insane." 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer to start modestly, a set of weights and a flat inclined bench for 
under $1,000 can give you a fair workout, not to mention keeping your house 
relatively uncluttered. While heavy weights build bulk, repetitions with 
lighter weights tone muscle and sculpt your body. 
</P>
<P>
Fitness equipment becomes really cost effective when more than one person uses 
it, so rope in your better half and get into shape together.

Water supply -- A story in the Jan. 14 South Bay Edition said incorrectly that 
most of the South Bay's drinking water is drawn from local aquifers. According 
to the West Basin Municipal Water District, wells provide about a quarter of 
the South Bay's drinking water. The rest is drawn from water supplies diverted 
to the Los Angeles area from Northern California and the Colorado River.

Ray Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey were found not guilty today of 
molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- 
acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation and conspiracy after nine 
weeks of deliberations. It was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a 
mistrial was declared on those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said later that they believed children had been molested but 
that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Buckeys 
were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, who both spent years in jail as the case progressed 
through the judicial system, sat silently as the acquittal was announced by the 
court clerk. Their eyes rimmed with tears. 
</P>
<P>
As the verdict was delivered, a single scream was heard in the courtroom of Los 
Angeles County Superior Court Judge William Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey left the courtroom without comment but his mother reacted angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything," she said outside the 
court. "My concern was for my son and what they've done to him . . . because my 
son would never harm a child." 
</P>
<P>
The acquittal concluded the end of the longest criminal trial in U.S. history, 
a case that stemmed from a 2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that 
he had been sodomized at his school by a "Mr. Ray." The case ultimately cost 
taxpayers $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a 
national focal point for the issue of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, in the courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims reacted 
bitterly in the crowded courtroom hallways. They lashed out at the prosecutors 
for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served 
by the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't allow us to protect kids," said John Cioffi, the father of 
two alleged victims. "I have no doubt these children were abused." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods, in particular their reliance 
on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviewing of the young witnesses at 
a Los Angeles child-abuse center. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not get in the children's own word their stories," said juror John 
Breese. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Lael Rubin said: "We ultimately must respect the jury's decision 
even though I personally disagree with it." She defended the decision to bring 
the case to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The case -- which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral 
copulation and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography sessions, 
"naked games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, animal 
mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in the fall 
of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a 2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her son 
had been sodomized by "Mr. Ray," and subsequent physical examinations indicated 
he had been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was arrested in September of that year but was released as the 
investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the 
Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of 
"uncharged suspects," and eight other South Bay nursery schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of 
McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept 
through the affluent beach town. Many parents took their youngsters to 
Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and 
treatment center, for evaluation. The majority were told that their children 
had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann 
Buckey; his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, 
and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson. A county grand 
jury had indicted them on 115 counts. That indictment was superseded in May by 
a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children. 
</P>
<P>
The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning. Then-Dist. 
Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught 
wind of the investigation, were pressing for action. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted 
untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews 
filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove 
embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for 
claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had 
been molested. 
</P>
<P>
Hysteria grew. Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide 
conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted 
"Ray Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an 
adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked 
by frequent shouting matches among three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys 
and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that 
lasted in one instance for 16 days. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a 
booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters. They 
munched cookies, swigged root beer and sometimes sobbed as they told of their 
experiences at McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy 
voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet 
by her teachers five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ray touched you, did you tell him it hurt?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the girl answered. 
</P>
<P>
"What did he say?" Rubin asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That it doesn't matter," the girl said softly. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, 
telling each, "The court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are 
guilty." The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled 
child witnesses came forward to testify. One child was allowed to testify by 
closed-circuit television under a state law passed especially for the McMartin 
case. 
</P>
<P>
But a week later, in January of 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, 
who had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of 
the seven defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence" and deciding to proceed 
only against Buckey and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The trial began with jury selection in April of 1987. Testimony began in July. 
The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided not to 
allow their children to testify. Eventually nine of 11 named victims took the 
witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, except for minor 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they 
described in graphic detail the abuses they said they suffered at the hands of 
the Buckeys. Their testimony was often raw and unsettling. The children's 
allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained 
their innocence. And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified 
that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution sought to show that the children had repeatedly been abused 
sexually but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like 
efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school but that the 
children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had 
happened to them. It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that 
the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
The six-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting 
the judge to comment that it had "poisoned" everyone it had touched. Day after 
day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre: 
</P>
<P>
* Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted 
colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts 
as, "This awful court. These awful people. These awful lies." 
</P>
<P>
* Therapist Kee MacFarlane, who conducted many of the interviews in which 
children first disclosed that they had been molested, came under fire when it 
was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but 
also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
* Former prosecutor Glenn Stevens became a key defense witness after leaking 
information that he believed that the defendants were innocent and signed a 
movie contract to tell his revised version of events. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old boy, testifying at the preliminary hearing, identified everyone 
from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his 
molesters and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery 
where they dug up corpses with shovels and pickaxes. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses' personal lives were probed, allegations of sexual perversity and 
affairs between participants were made by the defense, the prosecution accused 
the defense of "outrageously slimy conduct," and at least three people involved 
in the case died under suspicious circumstances.

A surprise bonus prize will push Saturday's jackpot in the California Lottery's 
Lotto 6-49 game to a guaranteed $30 million, lottery officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the new decade kickoff -- off with a bang," said lottery spokeswoman 
Joanne McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
No one correctly guessed all six numbers in Wednesday's drawing, leaving the 
$7.6-million grand prize unclaimed. Typically, the jackpot in the next drawing 
would have jumped to about $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials announced earlier this month that they would augment the 
grand prize by $10 million some time in January. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," McNabb said. "This is a surprise. . . . This is the first time 
we've had a special lotto jackpot bonus. It may not be the last." 
</P>
<P>
Lottery statisticians expect increased sales to boost the jackpot another $5 
million to the $30-million total.

The lion's share of benefits from cutting capital gains taxes would go to 
people who report gains year after year, not those whose incomes are boosted 
once in a lifetime by the sale of a family farm or business, congressional 
analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
The new report from the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation rebuts a key 
Bush Administration argument for the reduction and provides new evidence for 
Democrats who view a capital gains cut as a windfall for the rich.

Premier Marian Calfa resigned from the Communist Party today, thus becoming the 
first non-Communist head of government in Czechoslovakia in 41 years, the 
official CTK news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa, who announced his decision at a news conference, was the third Communist 
member of the Cabinet to quit the party in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Only seven Communists now remain in the 21-member Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
No explanation for the move was given. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa's resignation was seen as yet another blow to the prestige of the once 
all-powerful Communist Party. More than 200,000 of its 1.7 million members have 
quit the party since the former hard-line leadership was swept from power by 
massive pro-democracy demonstrations in November. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia now joins Poland and Romania as the only East Bloc countries 
with a non-Communist head of government.

BUSH HAILS BID TO SHIFT CONTROL OF FOREIGN AID

President Bush today expressed his "delight" with Senate Republican leader Bob 
Dole's proposal to shake up U.S. foreign aid allocations and give the White 
House, not Congress, more say over where the money goes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see it put the power where it should be on this matter and not 
mastermind foreign policy through 138 subcommittees allocating funds," Bush 
told reporters at the outset of an Oval Office meeting with the president of 
Turkey, Turgut Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
Dole also proposed cutting allocations to Turkey and the four other biggest 
recipients of U.S. foreign aid by 5% to free $330 million to help the emerging 
democracies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would discuss that proposal with Ozal, Bush replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be talking about that. I'll be talking about my delight that somebody 
understands that it's the President that ought to set these priorities and 
that's why I'm very pleased about it." 
</P>
<P>
Dole's proposal would seek to curtail the common congressional practice of 
"earmarking" chunks of the $14 billion in U.S. foreign aid for specific 
countries and projects.

ISRAEL HAS U.S. AID PROMISE, RABIN SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: OFFICIAL TELLS OF FUNDING PLEDGE IN '91 DESPITE CALL FOR CUT BY 
SEN. DOLE. BUT HE WORRIES ABOUT BEYOND NEXT YEAR.

Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today he received assurances that 
U.S. economic and military aid to his country will not be cut through 1991 even 
if the Bush Administration reshuffles its $14.6-billion budget for aid 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But Rabin registered concern beyond next year, saying Israel's own budget is 
strained by a rising influx of Soviet Jews and efforts to cope with Soviet 
weapons shipments to Syria, Iraq and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of all this, we believe that we deserve the continuation of the level 
of support that we get," Rabin told reporters after a 70-minute meeting with 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is the largest recipient of American foreign assistance, receiving $1.8 
billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic aid this year. Senate 
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, apparently with the support of the 
Administration, proposed this week diverting to Eastern Europe about $330 
million of the $6.8 billion that Israel and four other countries receive. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to promote democracy and to keep within current overall aid 
figures. The four other nations are Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin did not say who assured him that Israel could count on current levels, at 
least through fiscal year 1991. But he made the statement in discussing a 
meeting he held Wednesday evening with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that for this fiscal year the budget is approved, and unless there 
will be cuts, which I hope will not take place, there will be continuation," 
Rabin said. "When it comes to fiscal year 1991, I have the reasons to believe 
there will be no reduction in the support to Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he meant both military and economic aid, Rabin replied: "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say Israel and the others are not being targeted; that the 
Administration simply wants more flexibility in dispensing aid. But Israel's $3 
billion a year could be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
The Dole proposal is unpleasant for Israel, which also came under criticism 
Wednesday from the State Department for regarding the West Bank and Gaza as 
potential homes for Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Swiping at Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who vowed on Sunday to retain the 
territories and to settle some Soviet Jews there, State Department spokeswoman 
Margaret D. Tutwiler said his statements "were not helpful."

LOWER INTEREST RATES 'ARE JUSTIFIED,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

<P>
The White House, breaking with its usual no-comment stance on activities of the 
Federal Reserve Board, said today that "lower interest rates are justified." 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said recent economic reports show that 
the economy could benefit from an easier monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a recent drop in the prime (rate). That hasn't been totally passed 
through. But we nevertheless remain hopeful that it will be," Fitzwater told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Major banks lowered the prime interest rate Jan. 8 to 10%, down from 10.5%. The 
independent Federal Reserve, however, has not lowered its bellwether 7% 
discount rate, the rate it charges other banks, for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether sending a message to the central bank from the White House 
briefing room ran counter to the Administration's general policy of not 
commenting on matters before the Fed, Fitzwater said: 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a new message. But it's important occasionally to point out that 
lower interest rates are normally good for the economy."

The 1986 Chevrolet Camaro topped a list of the nation's most-stolen vehicles, 
thanks in part to the interchangeability of its parts with other General Motors 
Corp. cars, an insurance valuation company said. 
</P>
<P>
A list compiled by CCC Information Services Inc. of Chicago showed the 1986 
Camaro again in first place. 
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the 1987, '84 and '85 models of the Camaro. Camaros also 
held the top four spots on the most-stolen list for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Hyundai Excel GL, at No. 10, was the only car not made by GM that was 
in the top 10 among car thieves. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves, for the most part, are parts suppliers, CCC Vice President William 
Geen said. And interchangeability of parts, such as between the Firebird and 
Camaro, makes those cars more likely candidates for theft.

The government-owned Export-Import Bank of Japan is studying a request from 
three Southern U.S. states for subsidized loans, but a decision on the matter 
is still a way off, bank officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The governors of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi first raised the idea of 
the low-cost loans in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has been informally studying the possibility since then. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very premature," said Tadahiko Nakagawa, manager of the bank's 
international relations division. "The concept has not gained a consensus 
within the bank or the government." 
</P>
<P>
Officials denied a local press report that the bank plans to extend funds, 
possibly totaling $3 billion to $4 billion, for regional development in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
None of the states has yet put forward a specific project for the bank to 
study, they said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Export-Import Bank did decide to proceed with the plan, the loans could 
be used for roads, bridges or other projects designed to attract Japanese 
companies to set up factories in underdeveloped areas of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bank officials admitted that the proposal is fraught with difficulties. For 
example, the officials question why the bank should provide low-cost loans to 
one of the world's richest countries when poorer nations are crying for money. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, the loans could be used to help allay mounting U.S. concern 
about Japan's growing economic might and huge trade surplus.

Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, and 780 workers will be idled at its mid-sized car 
plant in Newark, Del. Another 750 workers will be indefinitely idled at its 
full-sized car plant in Belvidere, Ill., Nicoll said. 
</P>
<P>
All three plants will be closed the week of March 19. When they resume 
operations March 26, Chrysler will begin the process of reducing the work force 
at those plants.

Captain of capitalism Donald J. Trump is selling his sleek Trump Princess, the 
world's longest private yacht, and will upgrade to an even bigger flagship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had quite a lot of inquiries," said a spokesman for London yacht agents 
Nigel Burgess, which is charged with selling the Princess. 
</P>
<P>
An advertisement in the Financial Times described the 282-foot Trump Princess 
as "the world's most spectacular motor yacht . . . considered by all to be the 
greatest yacht ever built." 
</P>
<P>
Trump, 43, bought his Princess, built as Nabila for indicted Saudi arms dealer 
Adnan Khashoggi, from the Sultan of Brunei in 1987 for what he called a "song" 
-- a mere $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's new craft, being built by Amels Holland shipyard for delivery in 1992, 
will be 420 feet, or 10 feet longer than Britain's royal yacht Britannia.

RECORD COLD SLOWS HOUSING STARTS, OFF 8%

<P>
Housing starts, slowed by record cold weather over much of the nation last 
month, declined 8% in December and ended the year at the lowest level since the 
recession year of 1982, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the December decline helped slow construction of 
new homes and apartments to 1.37 million units in 1989, compared to 1.49 
million units the previous year, a 7.6% drop. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.37 million starts last year were the lowest since 1982 when 1.06 million 
units were built. Both the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the National 
Assn. of Home Builders are forecasting about 1.37 million starts in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Before the abnormally cold weather hit last month, the housing industry had 
been held back through much of this year by high interest rates, which have 
moderated recently. 
</P>
<P>
Starts dropped from a high of 1.68 million units last January to 1.26 million 
units in September before rebounding to 1.43 million units in October. Starts 
fell again in November, to 1.34 million units, pulled down by a 15.3% decline 
in multifamily projects. 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.78% at the end of December after peaking at 
over 11% last March. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of single-family homes in December fell 10% to an annual rate of 
904,000 units after falling 2% in November. That was the lowest since 862,000 
units were started in December, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment construction declined 2.4% to an annual rate of 331,000 units, 
compared to a 15.3% decline in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast posted the steepest decline, down 23.3%. That was followed by a 
10% drop in the South and a 9.8% decline in the Midwest. Starts rose only in 
the West, where they gained 3.4%.

The death of a fan who clashed with police at the Forum in Inglewood during a 
Grateful Dead concert last December won't change the group's plans to play 
there again in February, a band spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Grateful Dead will perform at the Forum Feb. 9, 10 and 11, spokesman Dennis 
McNally said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke in a phone interview from his office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A three-night series of shows by the band ended Dec. 10 with the death of a fan 
who stopped breathing while handcuffed in the back of a police car. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Shanahan, 19, died after being arrested on suspicion of being under the 
influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy later determined Shanahan died from compression of the neck caused 
by a carotid neck hold and the death was ruled a homicide. The Los Angeles 
County District Attorney's Office is investigating the incident.

INDUCTEE SIMON REFERS TO 'OTHER HAPPY' PAIRS IN ROCK HALL OF FAME

Paul Simon said he and Art Garfunkel would feel at home in the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame, noting that their relationship was rocky. 
</P>
<P>
"We can join those other happy couples," he said at Wednesday night's induction 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Ike and Tina Turner, the Everly Brothers, Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards), 
Paul (McCartney) and all of the other Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their breakups, Simon called Garfunkel "my oldest and best friend" more 
than once during his speech at the annual black-tie dinner at the 
Waldorf-Astoria. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Ballard, who wrote "The Twist," cried as he accepted his award. He said 
his wife, who also served as his manager, was killed in a hit-and-run accident 
in New York three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When she took me on four years ago, she swore she was going to take me back to 
the stars where I used to be," he said. "It's tragic she's not here tonight 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Ballard and Simon and Garfunkel, the acts inducted were the Four Tops; 
the Who; Bobby Darin, who died in 1973; the Four Seasons; the Kinks, and the 
Platters. 
</P>
<P>
The irreverent Kinks wore tuxedos to be inducted. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing everybody makes me realize rock 'n' roll has become respectable," Ray 
Davies said. "What a bummer." 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, about 60 musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Roger 
Daltry and Peter Townshend of the Who, hopped up on stage for a jam session.

JULIA MAKES EVIL HUMAN IN 'MACBETH' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Any production of "Macbeth" with as interesting an actor as Raul Julia in the 
title role should be home free. The New York Shakespeare Festival's revival, 
now on view at the Public Theater, is about halfway there. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about it is Julia, who plays the renegade Scottish king as a 
fearful monarch driven by a desire to be found out, rather than as a symbol of 
pure evil. 
</P>
<P>
Watch his eyes. And you can in the small, tightly enclosed playing area in the 
Public's Anspacher Theater. They are forever darting, never resting on one 
person or another. But the looks get more steely, more crazed as the killings 
go on and Macbeth tries to consolidate his power. 
</P>
<P>
Julia negotiates the big soliloquies with skill. His voice is strong, resonant; 
his manner thoughtful. There's even a hint of dark humor as he gradually gets 
caught up in the bloodletting and accepts it as inevitable. But he has little 
rapport with Melinda Mullins, a disappointment as Lady Macbeth. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jordan's straightforward direction is workmanlike, almost tentative. 
Still, there are striking moments. Banquo's ghost is a quite literal apparition 
-- a walking zombie doused in blood. And when Macduff learns about the death of 
his family, he pulls a hood over his head in grief. 
</P>
<P>
"Macbeth" is Shakespeare's most desolate play, but there's always Julia's 
intelligence at work to keep you absorbed. He makes that evil seem very human 
indeed.

LIZ SMITH: BAND-AID REMOVED FROM GDANSK'S SHIPYARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian television announced Wednesday that the Johnson &amp; Johnson Band-Aid 
widow, Basia (Mrs. Seward) Johnson of Princeton, N.J., has reneged on her 
promise to Lech Walesa to buy the Gdansk shipyards for a controlling $100 
million! 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Johnson became excited over this prospect while visiting Gdansk and 
signed a letter of intent. The matter was soon being played up all over the 
world that she was "the Angel of Gdansk" and the capitalist savior of Poland. 
Actual proceedings to buy the shipyard were to be completed this month. Now, 
Johnson has backed out. 
</P>
<P>
Many knowledgeable people feel this is the better part of wisdom since the 
shipyard is in such a terrible and antiquated mess and probably could not be 
brought back to a competitive level -- given the state-of-the-art shipyards 
that do exist elsewhere in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a psychological blow for Poland. I wasn't able to discover 
Johnson's official reason for her decision; her lawyers and advisers are mostly 
in Poland now. Nor what it means to her friendship with Walesa. They were 
profiled together, you may recall, in an amazing article in the New York Times 
Magazine, wherein, when Lech and Basia were rebuked for outrageous, open 
flirting with one another, the Polish labor leader said it didn't matter, that 
his wife could not read English. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Johnson will do something else important and urgent for the homeland of 
her birth instead of buying the shipyard. She is dedicated to reviving the 
beautiful but crumbling ancient city of Krakow. In April, she'll hold a show of 
her religious art collection in Warsaw, with the exhibition designed by the 
Italian movie and opera director Franco Zeffirelli. 
</P>
<P>
IF NEW YORK is unseasonably warm, it may be that Joan Collins is in town 
co-hosting the new Joan Lunden show, "Everyday." Joan blew in from Paris and 
went right to see "Gypsy" last night, dining at Le Cirque. This evening, she'll 
turn up at the National Center for Learning Disabilities party in the Marriott 
Marquis. Here, Joan will announce that Parlux Fragrances is going to donate a 
percentage of her new perfume, Spectacular, to the national center. Joan has 
always had a soft spot for disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
THE TALENTED Robert Guillaume -- so fabulous in his "Benson" reruns but now 
seen mostly in Milk of Magnesia commercials -- is in New York talking to 
director Hal Prince about appearing in a road company of "The Phantom of the 
Opera." Guillaume served a long apprenticeship in the '60s and '70s in musicals 
and has a fine voice. He studied opera. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW much-argued-over novel by Michael Thomas is titled "Hanover Place" -- 
not "Hanover House," "Hanover Square," "Hanover Road." So, on the blackboard 
100 times -- "Hanover Place" from Warner Books. Never mind, as Gilda would say 
-- buy it; read it!

manners, communication skills, helping with housework, attitude toward kids and 
personal appearance, and the magazine offers Michael J. Fox, David Byrne, Tom 
Cruise (who, nonetheless, is splitting with wife Mimi Rogers), Prince Andrew, 
Jeff Bridges, John F. Kennedy Jr., Tom Hanks and Jeff Goldblum as examples of 
"men who'll wear well." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the "men who'll wear out" include Sean Penn, Eddie Murphy, 
Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Jay McInerney, Bruce Willis, Ken Olin and Johnny 
Depp. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine also has a "good men who went bad" category for Elvis Presley,

Sugar Ray Leonard is giving up his World Boxing Council super middleweight 
title because he is uncertain whether he wants to defend it, his lawyer 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, 33, who successfully defended his title last month in an easy bout 
against one of his great rivals, Roberto Duran, made the decision after coming 
under pressure from the WBC to defend his title again, the office of lawyer 
Mike Trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer's office said word of the decision was sent to WBC President Jose 
Sulaiman in a letter dated Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray and I have had a chance to discuss his future, and he has indicated to me 
that he has not made a final decision (about his career)," Trainer said in the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
"However, he is aware that you are under pressure by fighters in his division 
that want to fight for the title. Accordingly, he has authorized me to 
relinquish, on his behalf, said title so that you can afford two worthy 
fighters the opportunity to fight for his title."

CLEMSON COACH QUITS AMID INQUIRY

<P>
Clemson's Danny Ford, the third winningest active football coach in the nation, 
resigned today in the wake of the second NCAA investigation during his 11 years 
at the Atlantic Coast Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Ford coached the Tigers to the national championship in 1981 
and compiled a 96-29-4 record, including a 5-3 mark in bowl games. But ever 
since Clemson received a letter of inquiry from the NCAA two weeks ago 
concerning 14 alleged rules violations, Ford's job was rumored to be in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I hereby resign as head football coach of Clemson University," Ford said. "I 
shall cooperate and participate with Clemson in the response to the NCAA 
investigation. I deny any wrongdoing on my part, and I am confident that an 
impartial review of the facts will so prove." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson did not name a replacement for Ford and a source within the athletic 
department said it could be a week before one is named. A Clemson spokesman 
said no assistant coaches had resigned or were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's resignation follows more than a decade filled with problems in the 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the program was placed on two years' probation after the NCAA found 70 
rules violations that occurred between 1976 and 1982. Charley Pell was the 
Clemson coach until the end of the 1978 season, when Ford took over and coached 
the Tigers in the 1978 Gator Bowl. That game is best remembered for the 
incident involving the late Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes, who was fired after 
he punched Tigers linebacker Charlie Bauman late in a 17-15 victory over the 
Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
During the last week, reports circulated that Ford and his lawyers were 
huddling with Clemson officials in hopes of working out a deal to allow him to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the resignation agreement, Ford will be paid $190,000 a year for 
the next three years. Depending on whether Ford accepts another head coaching 
job, he could be paid $190,000 for up to five years. Ford had a five-year 
contract that automatically extends one year after each season. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA outlined its latest allegations against Clemson on Jan. 5. The alleged 
violations include paying players up to $150 and the illegal recruiting of 
players from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting Ford's resignation, Athletic Director Bobby Robinson praised the 
coach for his accomplishments but also said there had been differences between 
the two men. 
</P>
<P>
"We have honest differences of opinion on certain basic aspects of the football 
program," Robinson said in a statement. "A separation under any terms would be 
difficult. An amicable parting is certainly less painful for all involved. That 
is why we felt it was in the university's best interests to agree to a fair 
settlement under the terms of Ford's contract and bringing the matter to a 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's resignation also may have been an attempt by the university to ease any 
penalties the NCAA may place on the school. Several schools in recent months 
have had their punishment lightened because the head coach was no longer 
employed there when the NCAA Committee on Infractions decided on sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson has until March 12 to respond in writing to the NCAA concerning the 
allegations. The infractions committee is expected to meet April 20-22 in 
Kansas City and to announce its decision two to four weeks later.

Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, who apologized to Asians after comments he 
made about San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice, now has upset 
officials in New Orleans, where the Broncos will play the 49ers in the Super 
Bowl on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"New Orleans is a tough place," Bowlen said this week. "One thing I would say 
is, I don't think it's a very good place for children and families. There's not 
a lot for kids to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bowlen confirmed Wednesday that the quote attributed to him was accurate and 
that he believes New Orleans is "an adult experience." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Gianna, the director of New Orleans' Tourism and Convention Commission, 
and Mickey Barthelemy, wife of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, have taken exception to 
the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"Has he even been here lately?" Gianna said. 
</P>
<P>
Gianna said Bowlen's comments reflected an impression of New Orleans that is 
outdated. "New Orleans has never been known predominantly as a family 
attraction, and that's something we're trying to tout," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Bowlen issued a written apology for comments he made Monday in 
referring to the 49ers' Rice as "a Chinaman . . . whose feet don't touch the 
ground." The Chinese for Affirmative Action in the Bay Area demanded that he 
answer to charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that Bowlen had attended an NFL owners meeting in New Orleans, Gianna 
said: "From what I know of those owners meetings, they're in and out. Has he 
heard about the Audubon Zoo, which is one of the top five zoos in the nation? 
Not only that, we have our Children's Museum by the riverfront area." 
</P>
<P>
Barthelemy acknowledged that New Orleans offers its share of nightlife 
inappropriate for youngsters. But she said, "Any city you visit, you make a 
determination of what you want to do, and if you have children with you, you 
just stay away from Bourbon Street."

$450 WILL BUY ONLY A CHEAP TICKET FOR THE SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tickets for the Jan. 28 Super Bowl game in the Louisiana Superdome are going 
for about $450 each -- and that's for the cheap seats. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are set by brokers who make the market in tickets for the big game, 
this time with the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
The best seats in the Superdome should sell for about $1,250 said Ken Solky, 
general manager of Murray's Tickets in Los Angeles. The least desirable seats 
-- in the upper end zones -- can be bought for $450, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the National Football League set $125 as the face value of a ticket, 
the tickets are sold out. Those who still want one must buy from brokers. 
</P>
<P>
"With (hotel) rooms being high down there, it makes this game a little too 
expensive for the average fan," Solky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the corporate set -- the high rollers who want to be in New Orleans to 
party during Super Bowl week -- price is no object, Solky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those folks don't care who plays or how much it costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's is based in California, one of two states where it is legal to resell 
a ticket for more than its face value. The other state is Texas. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, "scalping," the selling of a ticket for more than its face value, 
is illegal.

BLIND SKIER'S BLINDNESS QUESTIONED BY OFFICIALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A blind skier whose championship performance inspired admiration and donations 
has been suspended from a ski program for the disabled by officials who suspect 
that she is partially sighted. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Wallace, 25, of Flint insists the suspicions are unfounded and has 
threatened legal action against the ski officials. She said she has medical 
proof that she is totally blind and has leukemia and a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so phenomenally better than anybody I have dealt with that that causes 
some immediate concern," said Jack Benedict, director of the U.S. Disabled Ski 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand County Sheriff's Department in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colo., is 
investigating whether Wallace misrepresented herself to raise money from 
sponsors, Lt. Tom Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul diBello, program director at the National Sports Center for the Disabled 
at Winter Park Resorts in Colorado, said today that the district attorney's 
office and FBI are investigating, though neither agency would confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
If Wallace is found to have misrepresented her disability, she won't be allowed 
to compete in next month's international disabled ski championships and the 
medals she has won will be taken away, diBello said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace has received contributions from several Flint-area sponsors, a 
spokeswoman there said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace predicted that the suspension will be lifted as soon as she supplies 
the team with additional evidence of her medical condition, although she said 
she is unsure that she wants to remain in the program. She said she will demand 
a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
"They had no right suspending me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said they first confronted her with their suspicions Jan. 2. "They 
proceeded to tell me I didn't have cancer, I wasn't blind," Wallace said. "They 
said, 'You can't be part of this team if you're not blind.' " 
</P>
<P>
DiBello said today that he has not yet received any medical proof from Wallace 
and that she will have to go through "a very, very stringent test" to verify 
her lack of vision. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace began training in Colorado last summer after winning two gold medals 
during the U.S. Assn. of Blind Athletes national championships. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared to be a strong candidate to compete in the international 
championships to be held at Winter Park next month, officials said.

COLLEGE SNAPS 49-GAME LOSING STREAK

After three years of futility, the Ulster County Community College men's 
basketball team finally found a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The Senators, who had lost 49 straight games since early 1987, snapped out of 
the doldrums Wednesday night in Coach Chris Farina's first game, edging 
Berkshire Community College 73-72. 
</P>
<P>
Berkshire was unable to get off a shot in the game's final 17 seconds, and its 
last chance at victory was thwarted when David Vandermark came up with a steal 
as the gun sounded. 
</P>
<P>
That's when bedlam broke out among the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know how to act," Farina said. "We never talked about the streak. I 
thought we were going to the nationals. I looked at my assistant, and we were 
wondering if we were in the same game. All you could hear was 'The streak is 
over! The streak is over!' We might as well have beaten Kansas the way the kids 
reacted."

GRANT HANDS NORTH HOLLYWOOD 2ND LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Images linger from Wednesday's Grant-North Hollywood high battle of the 
neighborhood rivals: 
</P>
<P>
Grant point guard JoJo Halberstadt, leaping about at midcourt, gleefully waving 
his arms after having fired a bullet-like pass to teammate Rene de la Hoya, who 
scored the game's final -- and winning -- basket with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Grant student section, simultaneously erupting in a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood forward Harry Marks, after a stellar performance, burying his 
head in a towel -- and not surfacing for some time. 
</P>
<P>
On last-second heroics, Grant prevailed, 48-46, in this marquee game of the 
Valley Pac-8 Conference season. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood (15-2, 3-1 in conference play) had suffered its lone loss to 
Grant in a December tournament game. In an understatement, then, the Huskies 
had looked forward to the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Coach Howard Levine, though, knew that his team could beat the Huskies 
again if the Lances just neutralized the Huskies' do-everything center, Dana 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (14-3, 4-0), therefore, stuck to a 2-3 zone that gave new meaning 
to the term clogging the paint. Any time North Hollywood even considered 
passing the ball down low to Jones, five Grant players, principally led by 
center Brunell Mori, collapsed into the key. 
</P>
<P>
Mori and the defense stifled Jones to the extent that he attempted just four 
field goals. He scored only six points. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the plan," a smiling Levine said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
With Jones ineffective, the contest turned into a battle between the game's two 
most intense players -- Grant guard Keith Weinstein and North Hollywood's 
Marks. The two traded clutch baskets throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 37-37, and 6:03 remaining, Weinstein launched -- and was 
fouled on -- an NBA-distance three-point shot that hit all net. The free throw 
made it 41-37. Marks -- who finished with a team-high 20 points -- retaliated 
with a three-point shot of his own and then, after a steal of the inbounds 
pass, hit a 10-foot jump shot to swing the lead back in North Hollywood's 
favor, 42-41. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. With 28 seconds remaining and North Hollywood leading, 44-43, 
Weinstein -- who finished with a game-high 25 points and five three-point 
baskets -- picked up a loose ball on defense and broke away for a layup. Again 
he was fouled and he converted the free throw to give Grant a 46-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Marks, however, would not roll over. Fouled with 17 seconds left, he nailed 
both free throws to tie the score, 46-46. 
</P>
<P>
But that set the stage for Halberstadt's 10th -- and most vital -- assist. De 
La Hoya's layup finished the scoring and finished the Huskies.

NOVELIST FOCUSES ON CHILDHOOD ISOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an only child, Ann Beattie spent hours observing adults at work and play, 
usually with her parents and often apart from other children. It proved to be 
excellent training for a woman who has become one of America's premier short 
story writers and novelists. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably saw a lot of things that other kids didn't see because I was 
alone," she says. "Being integrated into an adult world happened very early on 
in my life, and it made me a watcher. I saw things as being wrought with 
significance, in one situation after another." 
</P>
<P>
Now, that experience has become the focal point of Beattie's latest novel, 
"Picturing Will," a haunting study of a young boy and the adults who make up 
his world. Unlike her earlier works, in which thirtysomething refugees from the 
1960s drift through an emotionally desolate landscape, this book features a 
more lyrical and psychologically direct style by the 42-year-old author. 
</P>
<P>
Beattie, who has chosen not to have children, says her book is an "extended 
meditation on childhood" and represents a bold new direction in her writing. 
More important, the author of such well-received short story collections as 
"Where You'll Find Me," and novels such as "Chilly Scenes of Winter," hopes her 
new book will put an end to the notion that she is somehow the voice of her 
generation, as more than one critic has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sore spot with Beattie, whose unsettling stories offer glimpses of 
moody, egocentric young adults stumbling through the '70s and '80s. Her brief, 
darkly written pieces are filled with middle-class people who tune in the 
Beatles on their car radios and are tormented by failing marriages, divorce, 
unhappy affairs and separations. Like the suburban characters in John Cheever's 
stories, they are prisoners of ennui. 
</P>
<P>
"What a lot of writers ignore is that I'm not a sociologist," says Beattie, 
relaxing on a sofa in her two-story brick home. "My test in writing these 
stories was not, did I get it right about the '60s, but, is it literature? What 
I care about is whether my writing succeeds." 
</P>
<P>
To her colleagues, that is no longer in doubt. Novelist Margaret Atwood, 
commenting on Beattie's distinctive writing style, wrote that, "if Ann Beattie 
were a ballerina, you could sell tickets to the warm-ups." Critic John Leonard 
praised the brooding tone of her stories, noting that "she seems to have jumped 
out of the head of an autumnal Samuel Beckett." 
</P>
<P>
Thin, composed and cerebral, Beattie comes across in person like the prose that 
has won her such a wide audience. Initially reluctant to talk much about 
herself, the author gradually reveals more personal nuggets until, by the end 
of an interview, something of a portrait emerges. Dressed in a black sweater, 
black pants and black cowboy boots, she looks younger than her years and 
periodically brushes a shock of long auburn hair out of her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, 'Picturing Will' was something of a mystery, because I had no idea how 
it would turn out until the very end," Beattie says. "I've spent a lot of time 
hanging around with kids, but all I knew is that I wanted to write a book about 
children, about childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest, how it turned out, how it developed, is something as mysterious to 
me today as it was when I first started writing more than 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Beattie says there were no early clues that she would become a 
writer. Born to a middle-class family in Washington, she was an indifferent 
student in high school and attended American University chiefly to satisfy her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Beattie flirted with journalism but then switched to an English 
major. About 1965, she began writing her first short stories, usually 
three-page vignettes about eccentric characters drawn from her own generation. 
</P>
<P>
Friends praised the work, but it was strictly a hobby. When Beattie later 
entered graduate school at the University of Connecticut, she dismissed the 
idea of writing for a living -- or doing anything for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a job in my life," Beattie says with a laugh. "I never wanted 
one then, and I don't want one now. I stayed in school not because of a love of 
the academic life or even because I wanted to buy time as a writer. I stayed in 
school because I didn't want to work." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came when Beattie's short stories were noticed by J. D. 
O'Hara, a professor and writer at the university. Without meeting her in 
person, O'Hara began suggesting editorial revisions in her works, leaving 
revised copies of the stories in the author's mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
It was all very flattering, but when O'Hara managed to sell several of her 
pieces to small college magazines in Utah and Texas, Beattie had a change of 
heart. Especially when the first checks arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I said, it's time to pursue that hobby!" she recalls. "I thought, you 
know, this might not be so bad after all." 
</P>
<P>
During the next several years, Beattie sold stories to the New Yorker and 
Esquire and began attracting attention in literary circles. Her reputation 
soared when "Chilly Scenes of Winter" was published in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The story of an obsessive love affair, the novel focused on a group of young 
adults in their 20s and became something of a cult classic. Many readers saw 
themselves in Beattie's post-college characters and her re-creation of the 
mid-'70s cultural scene. The book was eventually made into a movie, and Beattie 
had a cameo role as a harried coffee shop waitress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great, great experience," she says. "I got to wear the largest falsies 
of my life. It's true. They didn't have anything big enough in the costume 
department, so they put socks in." 
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, Beattie would publish several collections of short 
stories, such as "The Burning House" and "Secrets and Surprises," and novels 
including "Falling in Place" and "Love Always." After living in New York, New 
England and the South, she divorced her first husband and moved to 
Charlottesville, where she had once taught English at the University of 
Virginia. In 1988 she was married to Lincoln Perry, a painter. 
</P>
<P>
Although her work has evolved, certain hallmarks of the Ann Beattie style are 
apparent. The openings tend to be abrupt and confused, there is little physical 
description and the setting is often irrelevant. Readers who begin one of her 
short stories may feel like they've walked into the middle of an enigmatic play 
that started hours before. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not good movie beginnings," Beattie explains. "But I think that, 
because of the way the characters speak, and because of the narrator's tone of 
voice, you can pick up what kind of a world it is. I'm not trying to make it 
vivid visually, I'm trying to do it more through dialogue and through sentence 
cadence." 
</P>
<P>
When they work well together, these ingredients produce powerful results. In 
her masterful short story "In the White Night," Beattie builds from an 
ambiguous party scene to a shattering human tragedy in less than seven pages. 
In "The Burning House," she lays bare a crumbling marriage and concludes with a 
chilling, unforgettable farewell from a man to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Beattie has been able to write short stories with amazing speed, 
and reportedly finished the first draft for the novel "Love Always" in less 
than six weeks. But she says "Picturing Will" took more than three years to 
write and was her most exhausting project. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why exactly, but I had to struggle with this novel. Maybe it's 
because there was something very different about it, a story about childhood 
and a real departure for me." 
</P>
<P>
On the wall opposite the front door in Beattie's home hangs a large oil 
painting of a little boy. An adult is holding him protectively, while he stares 
at an abstract black and white shape behind a wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name is Will, is the child of one of Beattie's friends, and the 
painting was prompted by a family photograph that was never properly developed. 
It is a fitting symbol of the author's latest book, which blends disturbing 
snapshots of childhood with meditations on parental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that (Will's) character is somewhat similar to mine, as an only child, 
by saying that he's something of a watcher," she says. "But it also came out of 
the writing process -- where you create characters that embody some hidden 
aspect of yourself that you're not very often in touch with." As the book 
begins, Jody, a single mother, is raising Will, her 6-year-old son, in 
Charlottesville. The book focuses primarily on the boy and his thoughts, but 
eventually offers portraits of his mother, his friends, his stepfather, Mel, 
and his father, Wayne, who abandoned him years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually the barest threads of a narrative emerge: Jody's career as a 
photographer takes off and she moves with Will to New York to be with her 
lover. During a trip to Florida, Wayne makes it clear that he will not be a 
caring, nurturing person in his son's life. Will, who is shunted off to the 
sidelines by one adult after another, remains lost in a world of toy dinosaurs 
and playground outings until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
The element of surprise in "Picturing Will" is key, because characters who 
start out as sympathetic turn into selfish, distant adults. People who at first 
seem bumbling and ineffective become the real heroes in Will's life. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the scheme of the book is that any character is going to be more 
complex than any initial assessment that can be made," Beattie says. "At first, 
it's exactly what you see, and then, as with any life, whether it's a child or 
an adult, it's more than what you say." 
</P>
<P>
As Will's world gradually comes into focus, readers sense the impact that a 
6-year-old boy has on adults, and their often-callous treatment of him. But the 
book's real power emerges in a series of diary entries about parenthood that 
periodically interrupt the story. They feature some of Beattie's most evocative 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
In one passage, the narrator reflects on a young boy's rapid growth and the 
bittersweet knowledge that childhood is fleeting: 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes difficult to remember that he ever was (vulnerable). That the dog 
snapped at him, and he was afraid. That the cut got infected. That night after 
night, the same blue-bodied demon flicked its tail in his dreams. Sticky 
fingers. Wet sheets. A flood of tears. As you remember him, the child is always 
two." 
</P>
<P>
The author of these passages is not revealed until the end of the book, and it 
comes as a genuine surprise. But for Beattie, the real surprise was the way her 
characters took on a life of their own as the writing progressed.

Before completing her final draft, for example, she discarded 15 chapters and 
was uncertain where the book would begin. She had trouble developing the 
characters of Will's father and stepmother until their names were changed from 
Duane and Cory to Wayne and Corky. Then, magically, the problem disappeared.

"Usually, at some subconscious level, I catch on a little bit earlier than I 
did here," Beattie says. "But that's the good thing. I think most writers will 
tell you that once someone runs away with the material, ultimately, the writer 
is very thankful."

Asked about her upcoming projects, Beattie mentions several short stories in 
progress and a book about photography. But she sidesteps questions about how 
her work -- and outlook -- will change. Asked if she will once again draw on 
her own experience, Beattie finds that impossible to predict.

"It's just so hard to know," she says after a long pause. "I mean, all I can 
consistently say is that I write about what seems mysterious to me."
