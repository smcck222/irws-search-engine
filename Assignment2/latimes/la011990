EXPORTING MORALS TO EAST EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"No Place for Raging Capitalism," by Lucy Komisar (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 2) 
articulated my own sentiments regarding the political evolution in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be a forgone conclusion among many Americans that the collapse of 
totalitarian communism in Eastern Europe will invite full-blown American-style 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt it. Our glaring economic, health and educational inequality, coupled 
with violent crime, is not envied by a majority of Eastern Europeans. Despite 
America's proclivity for furious flag waving, it is now evident not all 
Europeans are wholly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
However, social democracy (i.e., Sweden) can provide Eastern Europeans 
political and personal freedoms while maintaining a responsible level of social 
benefits. The general consensus now seems to indicate gravitation toward social 
democracy among Eastern Europe's new leaders. A possible result could be the 
potential assimilation of these countries into an economically unified Europe.

BUSH PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So President Bush was distressed by TV's use of the split screen depicting him 
speaking with a light heart as the somber coffins arrived from Panama (Part A, 
Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
It does indeed seem a bit unfair, almost as unfair as Lee Atwater's frequent 
use of Willie Horton bracketed with Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election 
campaign. You sow, you reap.

PEACE DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most frightening concept to come out of Washington recently is the 
so-called "peace dividend," referred to by everyone with a shiny new idea in 
need of a buck. 
</P>
<P>
There exists no dividend with its resulting infusion of cash to liberate a 
budget shackled by huge deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Any savings realized as a result of decreased defense spending are merely 
non-spent dollars that immediately reduce the deficit. The savings are not 
actual hard dollars to be spent on alternative programs. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis of the federal budget is the lack of effective leadership and 
inability of elected representatives to make difficult decisions. The "problem" 
is not a lack of revenues, now approximately a trillion dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
New programs should be introduced on the basis of value after careful 
consideration, not on the ability of government accountants to perform various 
sleight of hand.

INTERETHNIC CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am getting a bit tired of reading so many Cassandra-type editorials and 
features as we enter the decade of the '90. Joel Kotkin's "New Interethnic 
Conflict Replaces an L.A. History of Biracial Politics" (Opinion, Jan. 7) is 
another example of this not only boring but harmful trend. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who have been working in the Los Angeles community during the past 
decade know that there is nothing "new" about the potential for interethnic 
conflicts in our city. Luckily, many of our responsible citizens disagree with 
Kotkin that these conflicts are "inevitable," and they have been doing 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Proactive efforts at different community levels include the Black-Korean 
Alliance, the United Neighborhood Council, the education Consortium of Central 
Los Angeles, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Latino-Black 
Roundtable, and the Minority Coalition for Responsible Growth. All of these are 
examples of pluralistic racial and ethnic organizations that have been working 
for the betterment of our city during the past years. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, perhaps we need to move beyond the identification of social 
problems and conflicts and focus on the formulation of solutions and 
intervention programs, such as offering workshops on intergroup relations to 
our educators, students, and members of our work force.

BLOCKING THE KHMER ROUGE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no more promising path to peace in Cambodia on the table right now than 
the new proposal for an enhanced role by the United Nations. China's 
willingness to support the plan raises hopes that finally there may be a 
resolution of the terrible strife. 
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have agreed on a set of 
principles designed to end the fighting, terminate the flow of foreign arms and 
outside intervention and clear the way for free elections under U.N. 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tall order, given the awful history of genocide, American and 
Vietnamese intervention and the continued fragmentation of power in that 
hapless nation. But recent fighting again has demonstrated that there is no 
other way out. As the five-power declaration affirms, "No acceptable solution 
can be achieved by force of arms." 
</P>
<P>
China, by voting with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, 
now appears prepared to accept the reality that its client within Cambodia, the 
Khmer Rouge, cannot battle its way back to power. The new declaration 
explicitly denies any of the four warring parties a veto over the peace process 
as they are brought together in dialogue to facilitate the transition. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easy to bring the rival groups together, as was evident in the 
collapse last August of a 19-nation conference seeking to create a government 
of national reconciliation. The Khmer Rouge, supported by China, is blamed in 
the deaths of at least a million people during its repressive rule from 1975 to 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Hun Sen is having difficulty shedding the image of being only 
a puppet of Hanoi even after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in September. 
The United States has played a complex role with support of two political 
movements, one led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the other by former Prime 
Minister Son Sann, both allied with the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Australia was the architect of the new peace plan, with Indonesia playing an 
important negotiating role. The plan fits well into the tradition of U.N. 
peacekeeping as provided by Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Unanimity among 
the permanent Security Council members is the essential ingredient. It is the 
ingredient that has been missing through so much of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The new move for an enlarged U.N. role comes, unfortunately, at a time when the 
organization itself has been weakened by failure of members to pay their 
assessments, even though the assessments are treaty obligations. Members owed 
$905 million at the end of 1989, including $517.7 million owed by the United 
States, the principal debtor, according to U.N. tabulations. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when permanent council members are proposing a new peacekeeping 
venture, the United States' debt includes $152.7 million for other peacekeeping 
operations, and the Soviet Union owes $122 million for the Lebanon peacekeeping 
operation alone. The other permanent members are basically paid up. President 
Bush had requested full payment last year but Congress refused.

EXPORTING MORALS TO EAST EUROPE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Komisar editorializes that the fall of communism in Eastern Europe will taint 
the Western democracies with a new ersatz socialism as Eastern Europe rebuilds. 
</P>
<P>
An irresponsible Komisar supports this new socialism and endorses higher taxes 
to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Thatcher-Reagan economic revolution has demonstrated the value of 
lower taxes in stimulating economic growth under capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the people of the West have consistently voted against higher taxes, 
even if this meant trimming social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Komisar supports a nationalized health service paid for with more taxes. In 
doing so she gives no credit to the American revolution in self-responsibility, 
demonstrated through a reduction of smoking, drinking and high-fat diets. 
</P>
<P>
She would openly encourage a government-run health service, that as Medi-Cal, 
the Veterans Hospital system and Eastern European medicine have all frankly 
demonstrated, would provide an inferior quality that Americans will not 
tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons of history are lost on this mistaken journalist, who fails to see 
the blight that socialism has wrought on individual responsibility and 
self-development.

<P>
Playboy magazine was unfairly maligned in Cal Thomas's column on American 
exports to Eastern Europe (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 3). He laments the introduction of 
Playboy into Hungary and criticized the magazine for placing an advertisement 
celebrating the new freedom in the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
If Thomas had his way, the yoke of communism would be replaced by the yoke of 
puritanism. But he's missing the point of the dramatic events of recent months. 
The people of Poland, Hungary, Romania and East Germany risked their lives for 
the right to be free from domination and censorship by any ruling class. In 
short, they want the same access to information and entertainment that Thomas 
enjoys in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy magazine helped change attitudes in the United States and will likely 
do the same in Eastern Europe. That's what the free exchange of ideas is all 
about.

MCNALL MESSAGE LOUD, CLEAR; KINGS AWAKEN, BATTER RED WINGS, 9-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings may be deficient in a lot of areas these days, but there's obviously 
nothing wrong with their ears. 
</P>
<P>
The message delivered publicly by team owner Bruce McNall Tuesday night got 
through loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by criticism from McNall and inundated with trade rumors, the Kings took 
their frustrations out on the Detroit Red Wings Thursday night, beating them, 
9-4, before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"The tension," said King Coach Tom Webster, "was pretty thick yesterday and 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly for Bernie Nicholls and Luc Robitaille, both of whom have been 
mentioned prominently in the trade whispers. 
</P>
<P>
And both responded on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think about it," said Robitaille, who scored his 34th and 35th goals, 
"since I'm not the one who is going to make a trade. I know if I work hard and 
they trade me, it won't be my fault. I would hate to leave here. But as long as 
I work hard, I can sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to get traded. Everyone likes to play here. This (trade talk) is 
no fun." 
</P>
<P>
The same sentiments were expressed by Nicholls, who said a talk with a friend 
before the game soothed his nerves. He had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of fond of this place," Nicholls said. "I'd like to stay here. But I 
don't think it should take trade talk to get you to play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Even in victory, the Kings continued to play in a way that has gotten them in 
so much trouble, both with their owner and opposing teams. Maligned for their 
defense, the Kings led Detroit, 5-1, after one period, then let the Red Wings 
back in the game. Over their last eight games, the Kings have given up 37 
goals, a average of nearly five a game. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, assuming leadership in this crisis, ignited Thursday's offense 
with a goal just 50 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was over, Gretzky scored his 26th and 27th goalsand had four assists. 
Defenseman Larry Robinson also had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
While it was a night worth celebrating, this was hardly a victory over the 
Stanley Cup champions. Detroit, last in the Norris Division at 16-25-6, has 
lost five of its last six games on the road and is 0-8-1 in its last nine away 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings, with dismal numbers to match the worst of teams recently, will 
take a victory where they find it these days. This was only only their first 
since New Year's Day. Since then, they had gone 0-6-1. They also had only two 
ties to show for their last six games at home and had fallen below .500 at 
20-21-5 for the season before Thursday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
All this had prompted McNall's outburst Tuesday night. After the game, he 
threatened to make some big moves, if necessary, to shake up the team. 
</P>
<P>
McNall backed off a bit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"All that's happened so far is that we've gotten a million phone calls," he 
said before the game. "There have been lots of talks, but I've seen nothing 
that I'm that interested in. I haven't seen anything I'm prepared to do. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody knows you're anxious to make a deal, sometimes they try to steal 
something. I'm not going to trade just to trade." 
</P>
<P>
McNall went public with his criticism after Tuesday night's loss to the Buffalo 
Sabres. That resulted in a whirlwind of trade rumors, the most prominent naming 
Nicholls and Robitaille. One New York paper reported a deal with the New York 
Rangers for Nicholls was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
While McNall isn't ruling anything out, he didn't give the impression of man 
operating out of desperation or anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry," he said, "just disappointed. Maybe complacency set in. We have 
a tremendous amount of talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe just the threat will make them (the players) come to the realization 
they have to make something happen. If not, we'll have to take some of these 
calls seriously. But so far, I haven't had an offer I couldn't refuse." 
</P>
<P>
McNall also said all of the calls have been incoming. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't made any calls," he said. "And we're not picking out a player and 
saying this is a player we want to move. If we were winning, we might not even 
listen to these calls. Now, we're listening." 
</P>
<P>
So were the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's game-opening goal came on a shot from the right circle. He took one 
shot, which was blocked by goalie Glen Hanlon. 
</P>
<P>
The puck came back to Gretzky, who fired from nearly the same spot and scored, 
extending his point-scoring streak to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski also scored two goals. The other Kings goals were scored by 
Jay Miller, Steve Duchesne and Mikko Makela. 
</P>
<P>
Former King Jimmy Carson scored one of Detroit's goals, the others going to 
Greg Adams, Daniel Shank and Marc Habscheid. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the players, after listening to all the public talk about their 
problems, had discussed them among themselves, goalie Kelly Hrudey replied: "Do 
we have to? We know the situation we're in. We are not a bunch of dummies. If 
we don't play well, a lot of us won't be here." 
</P>
<P>
While he wouldn't talk about any specific trades, McNall was intrigued with one 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Had he thought, he was asked, about swapping his close friend and hockey 
devotee, comedian John Candy, to the Lakers for their good-luck charm, Jack 
Nicholson? 
</P>
<P>
"Now that," McNall said, "I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
King General Manager Rogie Vachon is not planning on attending this weekend's 
All-Star game in Pittsburgh where officials from throughout the league will be 
on hand. McNall will attend . . . Mikko Makela's goal was the 100th of his 
career.

UCLA EXPERIENCES TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY, 87-79 
</P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long after Trevor Wilson lost his temper Thursday night, UCLA lost its 
share of the Pacific 10 Conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
The events at Stanford's Maples Pavilion were not unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford beat the Bruins, 87-79, before a sellout crowd of 7,500 in a game that 
turned with 2 minutes 56 seconds left, when UCLA's Wilson flew into a rage and 
was assessed a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Only moments earlier, with UCLA trailing, 71-70, Wilson stole the ball from 
guard Kenny Ammann of the Cardinal, drove the length of the floor and, ignoring 
teammate Darrick Martin on the opposite wing, missed a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that he had been fouled, Wilson snapped at official Mark Reischling 
as both made their way back down the court. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after fouling Cardinal guard John Patrick near midcourt, Wilson threw his 
arms into the air and screamed again at Reischling. 
</P>
<P>
Reischling called a technical. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick then made two free throws, Ammann made two more and, after the Cardinal 
also retained possession of the ball, Patrick made a baseline jumper that 
increased the Cardinal lead to 77-70. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was never able to recover and fell to 5-1 in the Pac-10, a game behind 
unbeaten Oregon State, which beat Washington State, 79-64. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Trevor," the crowd chanted in the final moments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything good to say," he said as he signed autographs afterward, 
"so I can't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick, however, lashed out at Reischling. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't control the game," Harrick said, "then you've got to get out. You 
just don't do that. You've got to be kidding. That's embarrassing. It's 
embarrassing for our conference to have a guy do something like that in a game 
on national television (ESPN)." 
</P>
<P>
Should Reischling have ignored Wilson's outburst? 
</P>
<P>
"You let the players decide the outcome of the game," Harrick said. "If you're 
going to call a technical, you call it early and control the game. Obviously, 
that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Trevor feels bad, but you've got to understand: He steals the ball, 
goes down and gets fouled. The guy just grabs his arm in front of the same 
officials and (the official) doesn't make that call. 
</P>
<P>
"But now he's visibly upset 'cause he missed a layup, too." 
</P>
<P>
The technical foul overshadowed a big effort by Stanford, which improved to 
11-3 overall and 3-2 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal won despite getting only five points in the second half from Adam 
Keefe, who led Stanford with 23 overall. Ammann scored 21 points and Patrick 
scored 18, making nine of 10 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (11-3) was led by Wilson, who made 14 of 21 shots and scored a season-high 
31 points, including 20 in the second half. Don MacLean scored 21 for the 
Bruins and Martin had 14 points and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick described Stanford this week as a mirror image of Arizona, so it wasn't 
surprising that UCLA started the game in a zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's strength is its inside game, especially in the person of Keefe, a 
6-9 sophomore from Irvine who came in as the Pac-10's No. 2 scorer and No. 1 
rebounder, averaging 21 points and 10.5 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, though, was concerned that Patrick and Ammann might make him regret 
his move. "I'm not sure their guards are as good as Arizona's," Harrick said, 
"but they're pretty good here at home." 
</P>
<P>
His fears were soon realized as Stanford made its first four shots, opening a 
10-6 lead in the first three minutes on a jumper from the wing by Deshon 
Wingate, a layup by Keefe and a pair of three-point bombs by Ammann, a junior 
from Huntington Beach who had made 46% of his three-pointers before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick quickly switched to a man-to-man but was still faced with the dilemma 
that has plagued everyone else in the Pac-10: How do you stop Keefe? 
</P>
<P>
Through the first half, the Bruins couldn't find an answer. 
</P>
<P>
The first time the Cardinal had the ball after UCLA switched out its zone, 
Keefe rebounded a missed shot by Andrew Vlahov, was fouled by Bruin center 
Keith Owens and made a pair of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The second time, he took a pass from Wingate and slammed in a two-handed dunk. 
Moments later, he was fouled again and made two more free throws. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 18 points before halftime and Stanford led, 43-38. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal never trailed in the half and twice built its lead to 10 points, 
at 28-18 and 35-25, but UCLA cut its deficit to 41-38 by putting together an 
8-2 run in which Wilson scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe then got tangled up inside as Stanford worked for the last shot of the 
half, losing the ball. Wingate, though, picked it up and made a layup at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal shot 62.5% from the floor and 90.9% from the line in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The second half started with Gerald Madkins assigned to stay in front of Keefe 
and keep him away from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
And through the first 10 minutes, Keefe was held in check. 
</P>
<P>
He never even touched the ball until 9:54 remained, when he pulled down an 
offensive rebound and scored on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
By then, though, UCLA had assumed the lead, outscoring the Cardinal, 17-6, 
after Ammann opened the half by making another three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins increased their advantage to 62-56, but Stanford then scored nine 
consecutive points to regain the lead, 65-62, with 7:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will play California Sunday at Berkeley, where it has lost twice in the 
last four seasons. The Bruins' losses in the 1985-86 and 1987-88 seasons are 
their only two against the Golden Bears in 61 games since 1961, when they lost 
a one-point loss at Berkeley. . . . The loss denied Coach Jim Harrick his 200th 
career victory. He was 167-97 in nine seasons at Pepperdine and is 32-13 in 1 
1/2 seasons at UCLA, including a 10-9 record on the road. 
</P>
<P>
After saying last week that he had given freshman Tracy Murray a green light to 
shoot whenever and wherever, Harrick said this week: "I want him to shoot open 
shots. And I want him to shoot when he's warmed up, after he's run up and down 
the court a few times." . . . Harrick on Kevin Walker, who started 42 
consecutive games for UCLA before being replaced in the starting lineup last 
week by Keith Owens: "He'll be called upon, and when he is, he'd better be 
ready." Walker played nine minutes against Stanford, all in the first half, and 
picked up three fouls trying to guard Adam Keefe.

AZTECS GET THE BEST, AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO BEAT NEW MEXICO 
</P>

<P>
Nothing is ordinary about San Diego State guard Michael Best. When he is at his 
worst, few players are as bad. But when he is at his best, it is something 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night was one of those special nights. 
</P>
<P>
Best came off the bench to score a game-high 24 points in leading the Aztecs to 
a 78-62 victory over New Mexico in a Western Athletic Conference game in front 
of 3,864 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
He did so with his usual flair. There were three-point baskets, driving layins, 
pull-up jumpers and reverse layups as Best made 10 of 13 shots from the field. 
The 24 points were one shy of his career high. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," Best said. "I can't say I'm going to shoot like that every 
night, but tonight must have been my lucky night." 
</P>
<P>
But scoring was not all he did. He rebounded (six), he passed (three assists) 
and played defense (three steals). And he did it all in 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
His playing time was limited because Coach Jim Brandenburg decided to start 
junior Arthur Massey in Best's place, keeping with a lineup he used Saturday in 
a 72-68 victory at Air Force. Best sat out that game with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"Just an old superstitious coach," Brandenburg said. "I didn't want to change 
what was successful. But Mike didn't seem to mind coming off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
The game was the kind of breakout performance the Aztecs needed from Best, who 
has struggled this year with weight and injury problems. Because as good as he 
was against the Lobos, he was at his near worst in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Best shot 14 of 46 (30.4%) and six of 25 (24.0%) from three-point range in the 
Aztecs' first three WAC games. Brandenburg had said he was going to let Best 
shoot his way out of his troubles. Maybe his patience was rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael has been fine in practice," Brandenburg said. "It has been in the 
games that he has his problems." 
</P>
<P>
But those troubles vanished in a second-half blitz that left the Lobos trailing 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
The first four minutes of the second half were as close they could be as 
neither team led by more than two points. But that was before Best took over. 
</P>
<P>
He scored nine consecutive points and 11 overall as part of a 22-6 SDSU run 
that turned a 41-39 deficit with 16:24 left into a 61-47 lead with 8:06 
remaining. The Lobos never got closer than 10 and Best added a signature touch 
with a three-point basket with two seconds left for the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Shawn Jamison scored 19 points and junior center Marty Dow added 
13 points and 11 rebounds, tying his season high. 
</P>
<P>
The victory raised the Aztecs' record to 11-7, their best start in five 
seasons. And it brought their conference record to 3-2 for the first time since 
the 1985-86 season. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Lobos to 1-4 in the conference for the first time since 
the 1981-82 season and 9-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos' problem was simple against the Aztecs, their offense was limited to 
Luc Longley, their 7-foot-2 junior center from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Longley scored 22 points, grabbed seven rebounds and blocked five shots. 
</P>
<P>
But when Longley was not scoring inside, the Lobos had little else. They shot a 
season-low 38.1% (24 of 63) from the field and made just two of 21 attempts 
from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The final score was quite a turnaround from an opening six minutes in which the 
Lobos looked unstoppable, racing to a 14-4 lead. And Longley, looked as if he 
was going to dominate on both ends, scoring twice at his end and blocking three 
Aztec shots at the other. 
</P>
<P>
The dominance of Longely and the Lobos continued through the first 10 minutes 
of the half as the Lobos held to a 23-13 lead with the help of eight points 
from Longley and a press that gave the Aztecs fits. But slowly the game began 
to swing back toward the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
And not surprisingly, it was Longley who had much to do with the change. Almost 
perfect in the first 10 minutes of the half, he was less than effective in the 
final 10, missing all five of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was the Aztecs' turn to make a run. They outscored the Lobos, 16-6, to 
tie the game for the first time since 2-2 at 29-29 with 3:40 to play in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The teams played on even ground for much of the rest of the half, with the 
Lobos holding a 36-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky to be down by one at the half," Brandenburg said. "But I figured 
if we could regroup in the second half and let our defense go to work we would 
be OK."

Gary Payton scored 24 points Thursday night as No. 18 Oregon State got its 
eighth consecutive victory and took over the Pacific 10 Conference lead by 
defeating Washington State, 79-64, at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Payton played only 11 minutes in the first half because of foul trouble but 
scored 16 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
He had four steals to lead the Beavers (13-2 overall, 6-0 in conference play). 
Washington State (7-10, 1-6) was led by Juan Thomas' 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State led from the start until Washington State tied the score, 43-43, 
with 16 minutes left on Jason Thompson's tip-in. Oregon State regained control, 
taking a 60-50 lead on Karl Anderson's basket with 10:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers, who shot 85% from the foul line in the second half, made 10 of 12 
free throws in the final 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon 65, Washington 54 -- Terrell Brandon made two three-point shots late in 
the game to lead the Ducks at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The second three-pointer came with 5:10 left and gave Oregon (8-7, 3-3) a 
12-point lead, 58-46. 
</P>
<P>
Washington forward Doug Meekins led a late surge that cut the lead to 60-54 
with 2:10 left. The Ducks came back as Brandon made a field goal and a free 
throw, and Keith Reynolds made two more free throws.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

<P>
SECOND-RANKED STANFORD ENDS UCLA'S STREAK, 98-80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA women's basketball team figured to come crashing back to Earth, and it 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from their most successful trip in five years, the Bruins played 
second-ranked Stanford at Pauley Pavilion. The Cardinal opened a 10-point 
halftime lead, then pulled away to a 98-80 victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal improved to 14-0 overall and 4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The 
Bruins, who had won four in a row on the road for the first time since the 
1984-85 season, are 8-6 overall, 3-1 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the Bruins have reason to feel optimistic -- they did better 
than most against Stanford, which had been beating its opponents by an average 
of more than 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
The 80 points were the most against the Cardinal this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We played as hard as I could have expected," UCLA Coach Billie Moore said. "If 
we continue to play that way, we should do well." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but the Cardinal, whose play was described by Coach Tara VanDerveer as 
"a little tentative at first," had little trouble doing what it does best -- 
scoring from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Katy Steding made four of eight three-point shots and finished with 16 
points. Guard Jennifer Azzi, Stanford's leading scorer, made three and finished 
with 19. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take away one side they just take (the ball) in and kick it back out to 
the other," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
But balance has always been a key for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Center Trisha Stevens, a 6-foot-3 junior, led four players in double figures 
with a game-high 29 points, 20 in the first half. Freshman Val Whiting, who did 
most of the damage from the inside, came off the bench to get 14 points and a 
game-high eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal outrebounded the Bruins, 42-38, and was better from the free-throw 
line, making 20 of 35, all 14 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins got 28 points from guard Rehema Stephens, 21 in the first half. 
Sandra VanEmbricqs, before leaving midway through the second half because of a 
sprained right ankle, added 14. 
</P>
<P>
But the double-teaming of Azzi, the pressuring of Stanford's outside shooters 
-- all served to leave Stephens open. 
</P>
<P>
California 55, USC 50 -- Center Kesha Martin scored 14 points and grabbed six 
rebounds to help the Bears hold off a second-half comeback by the Trojans at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by 15 points early in the game, USC rallied to 51-50 with a 
minute left in the game before a basket by Laura Baker and two free throws by 
Teresa Palmisano put the game away for California. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Joni Easterly led the Trojans with 17 points as USC fell to 1-3 in 
Pac-10 play and 3-8 overall. Cal is 3-2 and 11-4.

Michigan had trouble holding onto the ball Thursday night, but the sixth-ranked 
Wolverines held on long enough to defeat Ohio State, 90-88, in a Big Ten 
Conference game at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Calip scored 12 of his 19 points in the second half as Michigan, 
despite 17 turnovers, won for the third time in six days. 
</P>
<P>
"Calip did a great job for us," Coach Steve Fisher said. "He provided us a 
spark, both physically and emotionally, when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (13-2 overall, 3-1 in conference play) shot 44%. Ohio State (8-6, 
3-2), shot 47%. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes were led by Perry Carter with 29 points, 21 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan led, 47-46, at halftime, but Ohio State freshman Jimmy Jackson scored 
seven of his 18 points as the Buckeyes opened the second half with an 18-10 run 
to take a 64-57 lead with 14:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Calip's basket tied it, 68-68, with 9:47 left and a three-point basket by Sean 
Higgins completed a 7-0 run that put Michigan ahead, 71-68, with 9:25 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Kansas 132, Elizabeth City State 65 -- The Jayhawks raced to an 18-0 lead 
against their Division II opponents in a nonconference game at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (19-0) was led by Tony Brown's 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Calloway scored 18, Mark Randall 16 and Kirk Wagner 14 for Kansas. Power 
forward Alonzo Jamison, declared eligible earlier in the day after a 
three-semester layoff, had nine. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Illinois 74, Michigan State 63 -- Marcus Liberty scored 26 points for the 
Illini in a Big Ten game at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (13-2, 3-2) led, 34-21, at halftime, and 49-33 with 13 minutes left. 
But the Spartans (14-3, 3-1) went on a 21-8 run to cut the deficit to three 
points with seven minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty then made two free throws and Andy Kaufmann added a basket and free 
throw to pace the 14-2 spurt that put Illinois ahead, 71-56, with a minute 
left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Louisville 109, Tulane 96 -- LaBradford Smith scored seven points in 
less than three minutes, leading an early 9-2 surge to pace the Cardinals in a 
Metro Conference game at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (13-2, 3-1) led, 31-20, midway through the first half and 65-43 on a 
basket by Cornelius Holden four minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Indiana 83, Iowa 79 -- Eric Anderson scored 18 points, including two

City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (13-2, 3-2) rallied from a 41-36 halftime deficit to win for the first

When the West Coast Conference sent four men's basketball teams -- half of its 
membership -- to postseason tournaments last March, the WCC looked like an 
up-and-comer. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
Going into this weekend, the WCC is one of the lowest rated conferences in the 
country. Loyola Marymount, which has worked its way into the national ratings, 
is the only team with a winning record at 11-3. Pepperdine, expected to be a 
postseason contender, is 7-8 and in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody else is even close to .500. Take away Loyola's 8-2 road record and the 
other seven teams are 8-44 away from home. They're not even all that impressive 
at home at a combined 29-25. 
</P>
<P>
Even in conference play, no team other than Loyola has emerged. After one week, 
the Lions are the only team without a loss at 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
How bad have things gotten? The highlight of Gonzaga's week was placing two 
players on the dean's list. Pepperdine's Tom Lewis, who got preseason 
All-American mention, was suspended for eight days but was to be back on the 
team Monday. The Waves' 6-foot-10 transfer Mark Georgeson, expected to be a 
force at center, has been ineffective trying to come back from two years of 
inactivity due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara center Ron Reis scored 30 points last week against Loyola, making 
him the only player in the conference this season other than Loyola's Bo Kimble 
and Hank Gathers to score at least 30. Several WCC teams have had trouble 
matching Kimble's 36.6-point average. 
</P>
<P>
And pity Larry Steele, the Portland coach. As a player he knew mostly good 
times, first as a star at Kentucky and then as an integral member of the 
Portland Trail Blazers when they were an NBA power in the late 1970s. Not only 
did Steele suffer through an 8-48 record in his first two seasons with the 
conference's worst team, but last week an irregular heartbeat reoccurred at the 
end of a last-second loss to San Francisco. His accelerated heart rate didn't 
calm down after the game, so his cardiologist sidelined Steele for a game 
pending medical tests. He'll be back on the bench this weekend in Los Angeles, 
where games with Loyola and Pepperdine probably won't do much for his health. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury, trying to iron out his problems and stay in the 
running, has almost conceded that Loyola may be out of reach in the conference 
race. Can the Lions be tamed? "Probably not," he said. "They're playing very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Wait until next year? 
</P>
<P>
By the Numbers: Loyola Marymount's senior trio of Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and 
Jeff Fryer continues to pile up impressive statistics and move up the school 
career basketball lists. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers is 20 points away from replacing Forrest McKenzie as the school's (and 
West Coast Conference's) all-time scoring leader at 2,060. Counting his 
freshman stats from USC, Gathers is also close to joining an elite number of 
collegiate players in Division I history with more than 2,500 points and 1,000 
rebounds. He needs 17 rebounds and 226 points to reach those levels. Gathers 
has also moved into second place in school rebounding totals with 840 in a 
Lions uniform. He supplanted former teammate Mark Armstrong to move into the 
second spot over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, leading the nation in scoring, needs 19 points -- a good half for him 
-- to have the 20th best season total in Loyola history -- with the season only 
at the halfway mark. Kimble goes into tonight's game needing 269 points for 
2,000 in his career. With 1,391 points in his three Loyola seasons, Kimble has 
moved into 10th place in career scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer, with 1,497 points in his four-year career, is eighth on the Loyola 
career list and needs eight points to move past Ed Bento into seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola has the best shooting team in the West Coast Conference, but the Lions' 
foul shooting has been inexplicably spotty lately and they have tumbled to 
fifth in the WCC with a percentage of .677. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' free throw slide started in Philadelphia two weeks ago. Against 
LaSalle they made only 18 of 31 attempts (58%). Opening WCC play last week on 
the road, they managed only 22 of 38 (58%) at Santa Clara and 21 of 34 (62%) at 
San Diego for a three-game total of 61-for-103, a 59% rate. 
</P>
<P>
Only Kimble has been immune to the slump, staying at 90%. No other Lion is 
hitting 80%. Fryer, an 83% foul shooter last season, is hitting .667. 
</P>
<P>
Half Good: Dave Yanai's Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball team has led at 
the half nine times but has won only four of those contests. Overall, the Toros 
are outscoring opponents, 444-433, before halftime but have been blasted in the 
second period (and one overtime), 584-484. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, who play two road games this weekend, are 0-8 away from home. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
After Oklahoma's 66-51 upset by Kansas State, Loyola Marymount is now leading 
the NCAA in scoring, averaging 117.7 points. Oklahoma fell from 122 to 116.7 . 
. . . An overlooked scorer in Loyola's arsenal has been sophomore John 
O'Connell, who is on a 11-for-14 tear in his last six games and is shooting 
22-for-33 (.697) on the season. . . . In the first two West Coast Conference 
games, forward Per Stumer is shooting 10 for 13. . . . Loyola basketball Coach 
Paul Westhead is one victory away from tying John Arndt for career coaching 
victories at Loyola with 91. Arndt coached for seven seasons. Westhead is in 
the middle of his fifth. . . . Due to illness and foul trouble, the Dominguez 
Hills women's basketball team played the last 1:29 with only four players last 
week against Cal Poly Pomona. . . . Former South Torrance basketball star 
Rochelle Lightner, playing center for the University of San Diego, has missed 
the last two games after suffering a broken nose against Colorado.

</P>
<P>
TRACK: LAURA CATTIVERA FIRST RAN IN THE SUNKIST INVITATIONAL AT 15. SHE'S 
RETURNING AT 22 AFTER FIVE LOWER-LEG FRACTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time that Laura Cattivera ran in the Sunkist Invitational track meet 
she was a sophomore phenomenon at Mira Costa High competing in the seeded girls 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
She placed second that night, her 15th birthday, with a time of five minutes, 
one second. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:35, seven years later and two days before her 22nd birthday, 
Cattivera will again take to the Sports Arena indoor track in the Sunkist 
$100,000 women's mile, competing against Romanian star and Olympic 1,500-meter 
champion Paula Ivan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sort of homecoming for Cattivera, who has not been prominent in Los 
Angeles track and cross-country circles since her early high school days. 
</P>
<P>
"People have forgotten the name," said Vince O'Boyle, Cattivera's coach. "They 
haven't seen her, they don't know who she is." 
</P>
<P>
Cattivera didn't disappear. After her sophomore year in high school, when 
Cattivera qualified for the Kinney National Cross-Country meet, she was plagued 
by a series of five lower-leg fractures in high school that resulted from 
overtraining. The injuries prevented Cattivera from performing to her ability, 
and she competed only sporadically in her junior and senior years. 
</P>
<P>
Her history of injuries scared away some colleges, but Princeton cross-country 
and track Coach Peter Farrell didn't lose interest. He recruited Cattivera, 
pitching the fact that running at Princeton would present less pressure than at 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cattivera liked the idea of placing academics first and running second. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, though, academics came first, second and third at the Ivy 
League school. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year was tough," Cattivera said. "I was totally unprepared for the 
academics at Princeton." 
</P>
<P>
Cattivera, an American history major, adjusted to the academic load and began 
producing for the Tigers. As a junior, she was the heptagonal cross-country 
champion. The heptagonal competitors include the Ivy League, Army and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In her senior year at the outdoor heptagonals last May, Cattivera won the 
1,500, 3,000 and anchored the winning 800 relay on the same day, leading 
Princeton to a team championship. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was the most fun she had experienced at a track meet. 
</P>
<P>
Cattivera then placed fifth in the 3,000 at the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said the fun has just begun for Cattivera. 
</P>
<P>
"(Despite) all the academic distractions at Princeton, she became a 
national-class runner," he said. "I think, training in California, with just 
running to worry about, Laura can become an elite runner. I wouldn't compare 
her with Lynn Jennings (a Princeton alumna and world-class road racer and 
cross-country runner), but she is taking steps to be like her." 
</P>
<P>
O'Boyle said Cattivera has made good progress. Her personal bests are 4:41 for 
the mile, 4:17 for the 1,500 and 9:31 for the 3,000. Last fall she came in 13th 
at The Athletics Congress national cross-country meet at San Francisco. She is 
now training for the world cross-country championships qualifying meet to be 
held in February in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Cattivera hopes to make her homecoming successful by getting a speed 
workout in preparation for the February race. As far as the $100,000 prize 
offered in the mile to anyone who can break the world record of 4:18.86, 
Cattivera said it's out of reach and she "won't even worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Cattivera figures to refresh the memories of track watchers tonight. Thursday 
morning she ran into an old acquaintance who asked, "Are you still running?" 
Cattivera modestly answered with a nod, neglecting to mention the Sunkist meet. 
</P>
<P>
But after tonight's re-introduction to the track world and a possible 
appearance at the March world cross-country championships in France, everyone 
should know who Cattivera is. 
</P>
<P>
Again.

Would-be skiers will have a chance to try the sport today for free. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion is the fourth annual "National Learn to Ski Day," on which more 
than 250 ski areas, including 14 in California, are offering first-time, 
never-before-tried-it skiers a no-cost package that includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A beginner group lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rental skis, bindings, boots and poles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tickets for beginner lifts. 
</P>
<P>
Some restrictions apply, as they say in the airline business, and some resorts 
required telephone reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Four Southland areas are participating in the program -- Bear Mountain, Snow 
Valley and Snow Summit, in the Big Bear Lake area, and Mountain High, near 
Wrightwood. Snow Summit and Mountain High have already filled their quotas, but 
Bear Mountain will accept the first 150 and Snow Valley the first 100 today. 
</P>
<P>
Also participating are Mammoth Mountain, June Mountain, Iron Mountain, Heavenly 
Valley, Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, Northstar-at-Tahoe, Boreal, Soda Springs 
and Lassen Park. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to the United Ski Industries Assn., more than 35,000 
beginners took advantage of this offer. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings game: Ski and Snow Country magazines have each come up with 
ski-resort rankings this winter. Ski polled readers and the media, and included 
all of North America, whereas Snow Country had Abby Rand analyze reader 
responses to come up with separate lists for the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ski's overall top 10 were, in order, Vail, Colo.; Whistler/Blackcomb, B.C., 
Canada; Deer Valley, Utah; Snowmass, Colo.; Aspen Mountain, Colo.; Sun Valley, 
Ida.; Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Snowbird, Utah; Killington, Vt., and Mammoth 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mammoth Mountain was Ski's No. 1-rated weekend destination in the West, 
with Vail No. 2 and Squaw Valley No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Snow Summit was Ski's top day-trip area in the West; Bear Mountain was No. 
4, Mountain High No. 5 and Squaw Valley No. 6 (presumably as a day trip from 
the Bay Area). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Snow Country's overall top 10 U.S. resorts were, in order: Vail; Squaw 
Valley; Mt. Bachelor, Ore.; Steamboat Springs, Colo.; Mammoth Mountain; a tie 
between Snowmass and Jackson Hole; Park City, Utah; Winter Park, Colo.; a tie 
among Beaver Creek, Colo.; Breckenridge, Colo.; Snowbird and Alta, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
And for Nordic types, Cross Country Skier magazine provided regional ratings 
from a panel of experts and listed these areas as having the best cross-country 
ski trails in the West: Mt. Bachelor; Silver Star Mountain, B.C., Canada, and 
Russian Jack Springs and Kincaid Park, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>

GETTING HIS KICKS FROM SOCCER; 
</P>
<P>
ROLLING HILLS STANDOUT DOESN'T MISS RIGORS OF JAPAN'S SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home for Naoki Ishizaka lies thousands of miles away on the other side of the 
Pacific Rim. But whenever he starts to feel homesick, Ishizaka only needs to 
think of one word. 
</P>
<P>
Juku. 
</P>
<P>
In the Land of the Rising Sun, the juku is the rough equivalent of an academic 
boot camp. It's where Japanese high school students spend an average of 12 
hours a day studying to gain entrance into the country's finest universities. 
</P>
<P>
Today in Japan, Ishizaka's friends are logging those 12-plus hours of calculus, 
physics, biology, computer science, history and whatever else their instructors 
can pour into them. 
</P>
<P>
But today at Rolling Hills High School, the juku is the farthest thing from 
Ishizaka's mind. 
</P>
<P>
He can barely think beyond today's soccer match against archrival Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to beat Palos Verdes more than anything," Ishizaka said. "I'd like to 
beat them twice." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (9-7-1 overall, 3-3 in the Bay League) will need to have all 
components clicking when Palos Verdes, unbeaten in league, arrives for a 3 p.m. 
game at Rolling Hills. Ishizaka will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
The senior center-halfback is the backbone of Rolling Hills' midfield. He's a 
workmanlike ball handler, a steady playmaker who likes to dish the ball off so 
that teammates can make the goals and take the glory. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our field general," said Rolling Hills Coach Mike Shimizu. "He knows how 
to see the whole field instead of just seeing the ball at his feet. He's got 
the ability to see the spaces to run into and to put the ball into." 
</P>
<P>
Ishizaka arrived in the United States with his family in April, 1987. 
Ishizaka's father, Yoshio, is a top-level sales executive for Toyota U.S.A. 
When he was transferred to Torrance, he moved the family to a home in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tokyo suburb of Kawasaki, Ishizaka played three years of soccer for 
Ozenji, his junior high school. So when he arrived at Rolling Hills at age 16, 
soccer was the great equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
He made the sophomore team. He played a season as an outfielder for Rolling 
Hills' sophomore baseball team but quickly became bored with that sport. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Shimizu promoted Ishizaka to the varsity level. He's been a 
fixture in Rolling Hills' midfield ever since. 
</P>
<P>
And although Jay Finnigan and Neal Roy are Rolling Hills' leading scorers, 
Shimizu is quick to point out that it is Ishizaka who makes things tick in his 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a real good shot, he just doesn't use it as often as I'd like," 
Shimizu said. 
</P>
<P>
Ishizaka has scored two goals this season, both while following plays that he 
had set up for other players. 
</P>
<P>
Ishizaka provided the insurance goal in a league victory over Leuzinger when 
the goalie came out to smother a Rolling Hills miss. Ishizaka trailed the play 
perfectly and tapped the ball past the overextended keeper into the left corner 
of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Against Mira Costa, Ishizaka watched a missed shot pop out of the goal, 
sprinted in to stop the ball with his chest, then volleyed the shot into the 
right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
"Naoki's soccer style is sort of an extension of his personality," Shimizu 
said. "He's a fairly quiet individual, but he plays very good soccer." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his natural quietness, Ishizaka has emerged as Rolling Hills' 
vocal leader. Shimizu said Ishizaka helped the team through an early slump when 
many of the players were "quibbling and having problems focusing on the game." 
Ishizaka conducted the team from the midfield, commanding players on where to 
go and keeping them active in the flow of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our players respect Naoki a lot," Shimizu said. "When he 
talks, he talks with some purpose. He doesn't just talk." 
</P>
<P>
Respect is something that Ishizaka likes most about Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you prove yourself, and once they get to know you better, Americans give 
you respect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Ishizaka's most ardent American admirers is second-year coach Shimizu, 
who has four Japanese transfer students in his soccer program. Fuminori Shoji 
is a center-forward on the junior varsity team, and Kei Takeoka and Tatsuya 
Sunada are sophomore players. Only Ishizaka speaks fluent English. 
</P>
<P>
It's an interesting situation for the 28-year-old Shimizu, who is nisei -- a 
second-generation Japanese-American -- but has difficulty communicating with 
his Japanese-speaking players. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Ishizaka. 
</P>
<P>
"He helps me translate," Shimizu said. "If I'm not sure a concept is getting 
through, I'll ask him to help me out." 
</P>
<P>
Ishizaka got his first taste of the English language at an early age. For six 
years, until he was 10, Ishizaka lived with his family in Sydney and Melbourne, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Living abroad has been a worthwhile experience. At least in Australia and 
California, there is no juku. 
</P>
<P>
"School in Japan is the opposite of the way it is here," he said. "In Japan, 
you compete and work so hard for years to get into college. Then, when you get 
into college, it's like a party. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you kick back until after high school and then you work hard in 
college." 
</P>
<P>
Ishizaka may end up getting the best of both worlds. He's considering returning 
to Japan for college, where his best friend, Hidetoshi Tonoka, plays soccer for 
Yomiuri, the top club team in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But he's fascinated with America and Americans and would like to pursue a 
graduate degree and a career in the United States. He's especially taken with 
American sports, particularly basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get to see too many slam dunks in Japan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he returns to Japan, Ishizaka will take a cosmopolitan air back with him. 
He has two favorite baseball teams -- the Oakland Athletics and the Yomiuri 
Giants. His favorite soccer player is Michel Platini of France. He speaks 
near-perfect English, with a trace of an Australian accent but sprinkled with a 
healthy share of California slang like dude. 
</P>
<P>
And his soccer style? 
</P>
<P>
"It's Japanese," Ishizaka said. "Whatever that may be."

CANYON, MOORE PROVE TO BE LESS THAN INTIMIDATED IN RIDGECREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How difficult is it to win at Ridgecrest Burroughs? Very, considering that the 
Burros entered the season having lost just one home game since 1978. And that 
was a triple-overtime loss to Saugus in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's 80-57 road win against Burroughs last Friday was impressive for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, the crowd created enough noise to drown out the introduction of 
Canyon players. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Canyon's Lance Moore, who transferred from Burroughs this season, was 
greeted with boos, hisses and crude chants every time he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Moore had been instrumental in a victory over the Cowboys last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he touched the ball," Canyon Coach Greg Hayes said, "they'd either 
boo or cheer 'Moore-ON!' " They called him some other things that I wouldn't 
even repeat." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was unfazed, scoring six points and adding 11 assists. The loss was only 
Burroughs' second in 59 games at home. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hayes: "We love going up there. We'd play before their crowd every game if 
we could." 
</P>
<P>
No room at Verdugo Hills: Kurt Yarrington, the former Verdugo Hills baseball 
coach, says that extenuating circumstances accompanied his resignation as the 
Dons' coach after three years with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Yarrington inherited a team that had won just three games and in three years he 
took the Dons to the City Section 3-A Division playoffs, their first postseason 
appearance since 1976. Verdugo Hills was 12-12 last year, finished third in the 
Northeast League with a 9-7 record and lost in the first round of the playoffs 
to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Yarrington, a 1977 Verdugo Hills graduate, intended to return as coach this 
year but he was displaced from the school as a teacher as part of schoolwide 
cutbacks because of declining enrollment. He now teaches physical education and 
health at Portola Junior High in Tarzana and is unable to coach at Verdugo 
Hills as a walk-on because of time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get out of school in time to get over to coach," he said. "I'd still 
be coaching there if not for the move. I feel bad about the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Yarrington has been replaced by David Richard, a 20-year-old walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
Shortchanged: Want to impress Coach Kirt Kohlmeier? Make a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Hoover roster has its share of players who can shell opponents with 
three-point bombs. What Kohlmeier would truly relish is someone who could 
consistently make an unceremonious finger roll. 
</P>
<P>
The Tornadoes hit five three-point baskets Friday in the fourth quarter of a 
77-69 loss to Muir but missed several easy shots throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have trouble making one-footers," Kohlmeier said. "I'm baffled. I've never 
had a team that misses so many shots right next to the basket and is so 
prolific from outside. What we're working for is to get a layup. I think I 
better change my offensive philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Because it's the little things that count. Or don't count. 
</P>
<P>
The ebb and flow: Credit Agoura Coach Kevin Pasky with knowing his team's 
character, but that knowledge doesn't necessarily earn victories in the 
Frontier League. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (10-6 overall, 2-2 in league play) gave Santa Clara, the top-ranked 
Division IV team in the state, a scare last week and lost, 68-65. Pasky was 
concerned about the Chargers' ability to regroup from the emotional game in 
time for a game with Calabasas three days later. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we have enough character to come back Friday," Pasky said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Pasky had good reason for concern. Calabasas beat Agoura, 
61-45, on the Chargers' home court. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I know my kids," Pasky said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss might have awakened the Chargers, whom Pasky said are physically 
talented but lack the proper mental approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We got slapped in the face on Friday, which is kind of good," Pasky said after 
the loss. "If they didn't, they will tomorrow in practice." 
</P>
<P>
It must have worked. The Chargers thrashed Santa Ynez on Tuesday, 82-57. 
</P>
<P>
Play ball, almost: The weather forecast might call for winter storms, but guess 
what's lurking around the corner less than a month away? The baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
City Section teams can begin practicing Feb. 13 and the first Valley-area 
tournament starts Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando will play host to a six-team round-robin tournament that runs Feb. 
21-22 and Feb. 27-March 1. No championship game is scheduled but a first-place 
trophy will go to the team with the best record, San Fernando Coach Steve 
Marden said. 
</P>
<P>
Participating in the tournament with San Fernando will be Birmingham, Granada 
Hills, Grant, Poly and Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
League play among City teams begins March 8. Southern Section teams can begin 
practicing Feb. 19 and the season opens March 2. 
</P>
<P>
Fit to be tied: San Fernando basketball Coach Dick Crowell turned up at last 
Friday's game with Cleveland wearing a necktie that could have made Peter Max 
blanch. It featured a multicolored floral print and was roughly as wide as 
Crowell's chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gift from some of my students in 1969, when I was at Van Nuys High," 
Crowell explained. "I just sort of kept it and took it out a couple of years 
ago. The guys ragged on me a little bit, but we won that game. Now it's my 
good-luck tie." 
</P>
<P>
But is this tie really special, or is Crowell just a wee bit out of date? 
Evidence might support the latter theory. When San Fernando statistician Jeff 
Drumm was asked Friday night about the tie, he rolled his eyes and replied: 
"Oh, no, which one's he wearing this time?"

WORDIN NAMED TO U.S. NATIONAL CYCLING TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wordin of West Hills, who one year ago this week quit a full-time job to 
devote more time to his goal of becoming a national-class cyclist, has been 
selected to the U. S. National Cycling Team. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin, 25, who specializes in road-race and team-time trial events and 
recently attended the national team camp in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Dec. 
10-23, will join the team for the Tour of Texas, which begins March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member distance team is selected by a panel of coaches, most of whom 
attended the national camp last month, Wordin said. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin also is expected to accompany the team on a tour of Argentina and for 
the Tour de Trump road race later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale College kicker David Bowen and punter Eric Negrey will transfer to San 
Jose State when the semester ends Jan. 31, Vaquero Coach John Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen made seven of 10 field-goal attempts this season, including two from 46 
yards, and was 27 of 34 on extra-point kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Negrey averaged 37.2 yards a punt. 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto also said that running back Doug Dragomer and outside linebacker Mark 
Reeve will attend Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman Anthony Navarro is considering an offer from Utah and 
quarterback Darren Fitzgerald will choose between Humboldt State and Sonoma 
State, Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Kilpatrick and Faith Baptist each placed three players on the All-Southern 
Section 8-man football team for Large Division schools. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist quarterback Gavin Amos, running back Alex Estrada and lineman 
Jody Wurtz were selected to the first-team offense. 
</P>
<P>
Representing Camp Kilpatrick are running back Tayon Blockmon, linebacker 
Tarhonne Boyd and defensive lineman Wayne Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
All players are seniors except for Blockmon (a junior) and Estrada (a 
sophomore).

MARCACCINI TO COMPLETE SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
G. C. Marcaccini, the second-leading scorer for Notre Dame High, has decided to 
complete a one-month suspension from the basketball team and remain enrolled at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Marcaccini said that he was suspended after he tampered with a fire 
extinguisher, setting off a smoke alarm in the Palo Alto hotel in which the 
team was staying during a December holiday tournament. 
</P>
<P>
An entire floor of the hotel was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Marcaccini, a junior who is averaging 18 points a game, said that he will 
resume practicing with the team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Mick Cady was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring to Taft was an option Marcaccini said he had seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been if things were really bad," he said. "I was pretty close. 
. . . I talked to the junior varsity coach and he said I fit in. I'm a decent 
athlete and I like to run and gun." 
</P>
<P>
Marcaccini said that he has resolved his differences with Cady. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like him a lot and he really likes me," Marcaccini said. "He's a 
free-spirited guy." SAM FARMER

CHRISTIAN HERITAGE IMPROVES TO 15-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian Heritage held Azusa Pacific scoreless for five minutes 52 seconds in 
the final 6:19 Thursday to lock up a 75-69 men's basketball victory at Azusa 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage, the No. 1-ranked team in the National Christian College 
Athletic Assn., improved to 15-4 while tying a school record for the fourth 
time with its sixth consecutive victory. The Hawks have won 12 of their past 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage took a 21-4 lead 5:27 into the game, but Azusa Pacific 
fought back to take a 65-64 lead on Ed Miller's jump shot with 6:19 to play. 
The Hawks then went on the 11-0 run that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Soucie scored 29 for Christian Heritage, and Rundy Foster added 17. Mark 
Kraatz turned his right ankle early in the first half and is questionable for 
Saturday's homecoming game against The Masters. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego suffered its fourth consecutive defeat, losing to 
visiting St. Mary's, 59-57, in overtime in a West Coast Conference game. The 
score was 52-52 after regulation, and the Toreras had a chance to tie it again 
with six seconds left in overtime but failed to score. Chris Enger and Lynda 
Jones each scored 12 points for USD (10-6, 0-3). Cheree Tappin scored 28 for 
St. Mary's (12-5, 5-0). 
</P>
<P>
Julie Szukalski scored 24 points in Pacific's 68-64 Big West Conference victory 
over visiting San Diego State (2-14, 1-4). SDSU led, 30-28, at halftime. Julie 
Evans scored 28 points and Lori Lollis 15 for SDSU. Pacific improved to 7-7, 
2-4.

WOMEN'S GOLF 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State was fourth (322) and U.S. International seventh (332) after the 
first round of the Yamaha Holiday Classic at Carlton Oaks Country Club. Arizona 
State was leading with 312. 
</P>
<P>
Four golfers lead the individual competition at 75 -- Brandie Burton of Arizona 
State (a three-time winner at the Optimist Junior World Championships at Torrey 
Pines), Amy Fruwirth of Arizona State, Tracy Nakamura of Southern California

SCEcorp: The parent firm of Southern California Edison Co. posted 1989 profit 
of $778 million, about the same as the previous year. Revenue totaled $6.9 
billion, up 10%. The Rosemead firm attributed results in part to an increase in 
earnings at its non-utility subsidiaries, which more than offset a slight 
decline in utility earnings.

Clorox Co.: The Oakland-based home products maker said second-quarter earnings 
rose 6% from the previous year to $27.02 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 9% to $295.6 million. The year-ago quarter's results reflected an 
operating loss from the Olympic paints and stain business, which was sold. The 
company said total shipments of its products -- including Clorox liquid bleach, 
Liquid plumr drain opener, Match Light and BBQ Bag charcoal briquettes and 
Hidden Valley Ranch bottled salad dressing -- were up.

Wait for the Book: The commander of the battleship Iowa is retiring from the 
Navy and someday may write about the turret explosion last April that killed 47 
sailors. "Down the road, I might have a lot to say. But I've decided to save 
all that," Capt. Fred P. Moosally said Wednesday in Norfolk, Va. A Navy report 
said the explosion probably was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunner's 
mate who died in the explosion. That conclusion has been challenged by some of 
the victims' families and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Run Aground: Polish-born heiress Barbara Piasecka Johnson, one of America's 
richest women, dismissed suggestions through a spokesman in New York Thursday 
that her plan to save a Polish shipyard was falling through. News reports from 
Poland said Johnson's proposal to pump $100 million into the ailing Lenin 
Shipyard in Gdansk, where Lech Walesa founded the Solidarity movement, was 
failing because she had demanded that workers be paid lower wages and stage no 
strikes for five years. "We don't agree that the deal's unraveling," said John 
Peach, a Johnson aide. 
</P>
<P>
A Royal Wish: Princess Anne says she wishes her children had better role 
models. "I look around and wonder what sort of examples they have to look up to 
now," the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II said in London this week. "You find if 
you go to any number of countries where the small rural communities have very 
strict codes of behavior, you don't find much thieving and pilfering, and 
murder is almost unheard of," the princess said.

For Sale, One Mansion: A 68-year-old mansion in Dallas' fashionable Highland 
Park area has been listed for sale by Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who 
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month. The asking 
price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion is $2.8 million. The house has 
marble fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor. Nelson Hunt had 
made millions in silver speculation.

INTO THE NIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Wednesday night's party for the Renaissance Theatre Company, the 
British repertory troupe that is presenting "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and 
"King Lear" at the Mark Taper Forum. After a performance of "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," guests drove or walked the few blocks to the Wells Fargo 
building, where a buffet reception had been set up at the City Club on the 54th 
floor. Thanks to this week's rains, the clear cold night and spectacular view 
of the city lights made L.A. look almost livable. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Theatergoers seemed excited that a rep company of such international 
stature had landed in town for two months before going on to Tokyo and 
Australia. And the entire run was sold out last week, proving that Angelenos 
will go to the theater to see something besides adults dressed as giant felines 
or French revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: RTC director Kenneth Branagh and producer David Parfitt joined 
the cast and actors Lloyd Bridges, Jane Carr, Michael Crawford, Jessica Harper, 
Amy Irving, Dale Kristien, Rue McClanahan, Vincent Price, Lynn Redgrave, Brenda 
Vaccaro, and Alfre Woodard. Also there were officials from the Center Theatre 
Group board of directors and AT&amp;T, which underwrote the party (and took a 
lot of teasing for the fact that its long-distance systems went haywire on 
Monday). 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Somewhere between corporate and gala. Cast members showed up midway 
through the party in nice suits, looking freshly scrubbed and hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Shish kebab, ravioli, mushroom caps, fresh vegetables, fondue, champagne, 
and, in deference to British tastes, winter ale and hot tea. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: The fur coat, that politically incorrect garment of the '90s, was in 
scant evidence, despite Civic Center temperatures in the low 40s. Since 
Wednesday was one of the few nights of the year when Angelenos might really 
consider wearing mink or sable for practical rather than aesthetic reasons, 
perhaps fur coat owners are now the real endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Gordon Davidson explaining away AT&amp;T's long-distance problems on 
Monday: "I have absolute verification of the fact that these were all people 
calling L.A., trying to get tickets for the Renaissance Theatre Company." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: The Mark Taper Forum, in its never-ending search for downtown 
locations for its after-parties, found a good one at the City Club. It's close, 
comfortable, and elegant enough to host CTG supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: A dining room had been set up down the hall from the party, but it 
went unused all evening as guests ate standing near the buffet, shaking hands 
while they tried to balance plates and drinks. KEVIN ALLMAN

The Real Thing: Elton John and Paula Abdul will perform a duet in an upcoming 
commercial for Diet Coke. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-second commercial will debut during the 17th annual American Music 
Awards special Monday on ABC. In the ad, rock singer John sings from behind 
different pianos, while pop star Abdul sings and dances atop a huge keyboard. 
Michael A. Beindorff, vice president of marketing for Coca-Cola USA, called it 
a "stylized, updated version" of the "Just for the Taste of It" theme for Diet 
Coke, a campaign that has been used since 1982. BETH KLEID

Mural Wins Approval: The board of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment 
Agency voted unanimously Thursday morning to allow the Museum of Contemporary 
Art to go ahead with a plan to install a 218-foot-long mural on a wall of the 
Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo. The mural, designed by the noted artist 
Barbara Kruger, has a red, white and blue flag-like design emblazoned with a 
series of politically provocative questions. Plans to create the mural were 
stalled last year when some Little Tokyo residents and organizations objected 
to an original design that included the wording of the Pledge of Allegiance in 
the work. BETH KLEID

BILL CUNLIFFE MAKES L.A. DEBUT AT BON APPETIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can add Bill Cunliffe's name to the young jazz artists to watch in the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing driving and intense yet ragged-at-the-edges originals with an occasional 
New Age/contemporary concoction, the pianist -- recent winner of third annual 
Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition in Washington -- made 
plenty of music during his Los Angeles debut Tuesday at Bon Appetit in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Cunliffe, who just moved to the Southland from Cincinnati, 
worked with a trio (David Carpenter on six-string electric bass and drummer 
Joel Taylor) that was augmented at times by saxophonist Bob Sheppard. The 
players gamely tackled the leader's modern mainstream-ish pieces, which were 
rhythmically complex and technically demanding. And while the renditions were 
overbearing at times, they were never devoid of musical spark. 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive, dexterous craftsman who reveals such influences as McCoy Tyner, 
Bill Evans and Chick Corea, Cunliffe waded in passionately on "Traps," where 
his edgy, muscular statements commanded the listener's attention. He also 
created heat on "Attack of the Mad Boppers," a fast tune marked by fiery lines 
that still rang melodiously. The pianist displayed a refreshing calmer side on 
"The Gift," where he started soothingly and gradually built to a bigger sound. 
</P>
<P>
On a medley of requisite Monk tunes, Cunliffe retained the late master's 
authenticity while investing the tunes with his own personality. In Cunliffe's 
hands, " 'Round Midnight" glowed and "Evidence," based on the standard "Just 
You, Just Me," crackled. 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard, one of Los Angeles' top sideman, was in his usual spirited form, 
delivering inventive, fervent alto solos on "Joyous Dance" and "Mad Boppers." 
Carpenter contributed good bass lines and a number of well-constructed, fluidly 
offered solos and Taylor, though his kit sound came off a bit muddy, provided 
perky, tight time. 
</P>
<P>
To present a balanced performance, Cunliffe needs to back off occasionally, 
lessen his intensity and give his audience some breathing room. Achieving that, 
this invigorating musician's future would appear to be full of nothing but 
promise. ZAN STEWART

CARMEN MCRAE HITS HER STRIDE AT CATALINA BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hearing Carmen McRae sing these days is a bit like watching a veteran pitcher 
come to the mound in a tight situation. Both may be a bit creaky getting 
started, missing a target here and there, not quite in control of the 
overpowering talents that got them to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But when the game is on the line, they both come through -- winning because 
winning is what they know best. McRae's opening set at Hollywood's Catalina Bar 
&amp; Grill on Tuesday night was a perfect example of how this master singer 
has adjusted her performing to the inevitable changes that time brings. 
</P>
<P>
Starting somewhat erratically, she moved through standards like "Never Let Me 
Go" and "I Concentrate on You" plagued by little lapses of pitch and emphasis, 
never quite getting to the centers of the songs. It even appeared, for a few 
distressing moments, that her usually dependable skills were being supported by 
sheer instincts alone. 
</P>
<P>
When McRae dug into a sensuously swinging duet with bassist Scott Colley on 
"Get Out of Town," however, she suddenly blossomed to life, a musical phoenix 
rising through the rhythm. Her revival continued with a gorgeous ballad 
interpretation of "More Than You Know" (including the lovely verse) and a 
scat-filled set of variations on "Old Devil Moon." 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, McRae was in her stride. Two more standards, "For All We 
Know" and "Mean to Me," followed -- executed with the precise diction and 
crystal-clear musical focus that have been her stocks in trade for nearly four 
decades. As a final bit of icing on the cake, McRae closed with an attractive 
new song, Brazilian singer-songwriter Djavan's "Upside Down." 
</P>
<P>
Backed by pianist Eric Gunnison, drummer Mark Pulice and bassist Colley, 
McRae's performance was a small gem of musical maturity. She continues at 
Catalina's through Sunday night. DON HECKMAN

RED HOLLOWAY, STACY ROWLES TEAMED AT INDIGO CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Indigo Jazz Club in the Compton Lazben Hotel a new jazz partnership is 
being tried out this week, as the saxophonist Red Holloway locks horns with the 
trumpeter Stacy Rowles. 
</P>
<P>
Though there had clearly been no rehearsal and the group had no original 
material to lend it a personal character, the results were generally 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The set opened with Rowles playing fluegelhorn and Holloway on alto sax playing 
that most insipid of vehicles, "Mack the Knife," but once past the theme, they 
used its adequate harmonic patterns and some fast and fluent blowing. 
</P>
<P>
Switching to trumpet and tenor sax, they tackled "Things Ain't What They Used 
to Be," which, as a blues, was a natural vehicle for them. On "Caravan," Paul 
Humphrey offered a fittingly exotic introduction, using mallets, and altering 
the pitch by moving his elbows around the drums. 
</P>
<P>
Rowles had her own solo workout with a lyrical "Emily" and Holloway found 
hard-cooking new ways to deal with "Love for Sale," partly in waltz time. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the group were Richard Reid, a strong and supportive bass player, 
and the pianist Dwight Dickerson, whose "Prelude to a Kiss" was a mite too 
flowery but never dull. Holloway's attempts to sing the blues was amusing, but 
he could use a fresher and more cohesive set of lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
The finale, "Mood Indigo," which seems to have become the theme song for this 
room, underwent major surgery as the band doubled the time, then quadrupled it 
-- hardly an indigo mood, but one that achieved a spirited level of creation as 
Rowles and Holloway met the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was a noisy, yakking, inconsiderate audience. Visitors who 
catch the group before its Saturday closing, are advised to find a seat close 
to the music. LEONARD FEATHER

WORMY THRILLS, FEAR AND HUMOR BURROW UP IN 'TREMORS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most horror movies take place in the dark. "Tremors" (citywide), a jocular 
good-time monster film with surprises up its sleeve, is set in the clear day, 
in a desert landscape that seems to stretch endlessly toward the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
In this National Geographic wasteland, full of vast cliffs, buttes, arroyos and 
clumps of rock, nothing, so it seems, can hide. The air is so clear, the 
terrain so vast, that the little desert town slapped in the middle of it -- 
sarcastically named Perfection -- seems invulnerable to sneak attack. Except, 
of course, from below. 
</P>
<P>
That's where producers-writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock and director Ron 
Underwood spring the assault on their nine complacent Perfectionites. That 
subterranean menace comes from four huge earthworms: 30 feet long, ravenously 
hungry, with huge split, snaky tentacle-tongues that grab victims and suck them 
down. 
</P>
<P>
These worms, ingeniously designed by Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis, have a lot 
more personality than the ones in "Dune." For one thing, they're frighteningly 
fast and agile, tunneling under the desert with terrifying speed, executing all 
sorts of clever ruses and strategies, tearing up the phone lines, closing the 
roads. Gradually they pin their victims down in a small area, driving them up 
to the roofs or onto the huge rocks. The worms can't see -- which is their 
fatal flaw -- but they hear everything, nailing their prey from the ground 
vibrations. In this isolated, paralyzingly sunny landscape, they're the 
ultimate burrowing-from-within terror: the earth striking back. 
</P>
<P>
This is Western territory, and Wilson and Maddock infuse "Tremors" with a 
comic-Western sensibility. The characters are a bit reminiscent of the old 
"Andy Griffith Show." The heroes are bumbling handymen named Valentine and Earl 
(Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) and they keep playing kid games and razzing each 
other. How they keep busy at all in a town with barely a dozen people is an 
unsolved mystery. 
</P>
<P>
The heroine is a city girl who seems to exist as a feminist refutation of 
Valentine's bosomy Playboy-blonde fantasies: Finn Carter as discombobulated but 
plucky seismic scientist Rhonda LeBeck. The action is big and garish and the 
narrative pattern -- the isolated community under siege by out-of-scale 
monsters -- goes all the way back to '50s horror movies like "Attack of the 
Crab Monsters" or "Tarantula." 
</P>
<P>
Most recent movies that try to revive the spirit of those postwar-nightmare 
pictures fail because they can't recapture the right kind of innocence. They 
get too knowing or overscaled, or they let the gore-meisters take over. But 
"Tremors" suggests the early '60s as well. Like Hitchcock in "The Birds," the 
film makers make their beleaguered community a cross-section: the obsessive, 
over-fortified survivalists (Michael Gross and C&amp;W star Reba McEntire,) the 
rustic store owner (Victor Wong), a cute Spielbergian mother and child and an 
obnoxious teen-ager who keeps crying wolf. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a moral: If we all pull together, we can survive any catastrophe. 
This is a pop-populist horror movie. It isn't about the tensions that pull 
people apart, but the bogymen that drive them together. At the end, even the 
survivalists put the community's interests first, leaving their bomb shelter 
and joining a mass action. 
</P>
<P>
Maddock and Wilson, who wrote the "Short Circuit" movies, are keyed in to 
small-town rhythms and sensibilities and, though they're imitating hack writers 
here, at least they're trying to be clever hacks. And they are. They're also 
well served by the cast in general and by Underwood, who keeps everything loud, 
fast and shiny. There's even a genuine battle of wits going on between the 
humans and the worms. If the humans mostly make dopey decisions and the worms 
show uncommon cunning and resilience, they're still more interesting opponents 
than the slaughtered lambs and nightmares from hell in most other horror 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Tremors" (rated PG-13) probably isn't for aesthetes or sophisticates, even 
slumming ones -- though they may enjoy it, too. In this cheerful, unsadistic 
monster film, there's nothing oozy-sick or over-gory. Though the worms, or 
"graboids," are a fairly repulsive creation, they aren't the slimy ecch-beings 
popular since "Alien." It's a zippy melodrama for small-town America and 
small-towners at heart: well-executed kitsch for audiences that will still be 
amused at the notion that the bugs are getting so big, they'll drag us all 
down.

A tight structure of interlocking bars marks Ned Evans' newest abstract 
paintings. Vertical and horizontal angles allude to earlier brick-wall motifs. 
</P>
<P>
These works have a surprisingly free-flowing momentum due to the spontaneity of 
thick plaster surfaces. Despite geometric regimentation of structure, 
happenstance seems to ooze like liquid light from the four panels of the black 
and white "Duale." Thick bands of black line act like window frames 
unsuccessfully holding onto panes of milky, yellowish glass. 
</P>
<P>
In other paintings the pattern created by right-angle meetings of colored bars 
has a mesmerizing, Zen sand painting kind of motion. It suggests watery 
currents and pathways through quiet gardens. Flanked on either side by small, 
thin, vertical panels of solid color, the activity feels compressed and bounded 
like water in a deep channel. Thick-to-thin surface treatment adds rich, 
textural appeal, especially when color turns bright and assertive. (Michael 
Maloney, 602 Colorado Ave., to Feb. 28.) SUVAN GEER

Cascades of dense dark paint shrouded in thin, slippery whitewash make Joe 
Goode's newest paintings into waterfalls. Like earlier "Tree" and "Forest Fire" 
series, the artist again gives us abstraction carefully wrapped in the guise of 
the natural environment, or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The surface of these long, slender, dark paintings are rich with textural 
marks. The color frequently suggests slate or serpentine stone but is applied 
loosely so that underlying layers of contrasting color can peek through mixed 
on the surface. A spray of white paint dashes from the top and down the center 
of this painterly agitation. Like water spilling over rocks in a waterfall, the 
white spreads out and mists portions of the canvas in a transparent veil of 
brightness. 
</P>
<P>
As much as Goode's paintings suggest waterfalls, they resolutely defy being 
representational painting. They pursue the exploration of abstraction as a 
concept. But in series after series he keeps such forays into deep painterly 
thought thoroughly accessible. (James Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to Feb. 
10.) SUVAN GEER

Humble things, manmade and not, huddle together in Daniel Moynihan's pale, 
self-effacing paintings. Light bulbs, persimmons and tomatoes are lumped 
together on a green ironing board with deliberate lack of ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The muted pearly gray bulbs and the dull red persimmons seem oddly kin to one 
another. Moynihan also aptly mates pears and light bulbs. The work seems to be 
about the life of objects as apart from their human uses; suddenly it seems as 
if all things, live or inanimate, may exist in a secret confederacy of twinned 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pineapple, Dunmore, Scotland" takes a slightly different tack. A pineapple 
reigns in exotic splendor on a small island over a handful of small, chalky 
rocks. A vague blue-white mountain rises dreamily in the background. The image 
-- has the puckish, eccentric flavor of vintage travel ads. A graduate of 
London's Slade School of Art showing solo for the first time in Los Angeles, 
Moynihan adds a welcome piquancy of his own to his "typically English" low-key, 
mist-suffused palette, fascination with the mundane and literary bent. (McGrath 
Gallery, 454 N. Robertson Blvd., to Feb. 8.) CATHY CURTIS

A seasoned and widely exhibited photographer of zany dioramas made from bizarre 
common objects, Boyd Webb began as a conceptual artist making photos to 
document his sculpture. Before long the photo became the art and Webb brought 
the savvy, subversive imagination of a surrealist painter to large color 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
Current works mix a silly kind of grace and a faux Oriental sensibility to 
comment on our waning ecosystem. Webb creates rippling water from clear 
plastic. Out of this sprout thin green reeds whose tips erupt into clusters of 
inflatable plastic tigers carefully staged to look like exotic, wilting 
flowers. Two remarkable works feature a cross section of "water" in which 
floats a jellyfish made from a plastic bag. Trapped inside the "sea creature" 
is the cutest diaper-ad baby. The idea of our seas, our wild life and innocent, 
hapless humankind suffocated by its own artifice and debris is discreetly 
tucked into these luminous, overtly frolicking photos. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Webb's caginess, Canadian conceptualist Dominique Blain uses a 
sledgehammer. She makes a musty, tomb-like room with walls made from 
sand-filled burlap bags used to fend off floods or to make bunkers in 
battlefields. On one wall are ostentatiously framed 1917 photos of works of art 
and architecture wrapped in similar sand bags to protect them from damage 
during World War I. On the floor of the mute room is a large composite photo of 
dead victims of political violence. For Blain, values, priorities, indeed 
meaning itself are politically dictated: the dominant culture choses to define 
church facades as precious protectables, while it defines human life as 
expendable. (Meyers/Bloom Gallery, 2112 Broadway, to Feb. 17.) MARLENA DONOHUE

GOOD SEAFOOD IS THE HOOK AT DELMONICO'S GRILLE

Back when the Cajun craze was new, the Ritz Cafe opened in a blaze of 
searchlights and proceeded to move vast quantities of Louisiana food. The 
dishes may not always have been terribly authentic -- for a while the Ritz had 
a lot of people in our time zone thinking gumbo was beef stew mixed with 
oysters -- but it was always a pleasant, old-fashioned place to eat, 
particularly if you could figure how to get one of the cozy wooden booths. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, it dropped the Cajun routine altogether, put a mural of dancing 
dolphins on the wall and became Delmonico's Seafood Grille. Certainly it was 
upholding its own tradition by again naming itself after a fancy 
turn-of-the-century eatery, but I was uneasy about the change, particularly 
when I saw a menu that looked like just another eclectic California list, 
complete with pastas. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's a remarkably good menu, and a number of the best things on it 
aren't seafood at all. For instance, the veal ravioli in a powerhouse cream and 
meat glaze sauce exploding with porcini mushroom flavor. Or the Sicilian 
chicken, which gets a whole section of the menu to itself: chicken roasted with 
onions, peppercorns and bits of orange peel. On the side is a miniature version 
of pommes Anna; think of it as two flat layers of extra-brown potato chips with 
garlic sandwiched in between. 
</P>
<P>
Another dish that comes with that "potato pie" is the surprisingly good duck in 
peach brandy sauce. The skin is beautifully crisp, although scarcely brown at 
all, and the sauce is a strong reduction of duck juices with a subtle dash of 
peach and brandy flavoring. There are a couple of slices of fresh peach in it, 
presumably as a token of genuine peachiness. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, most of the menu is seafood, about 40 different types per day. 
There are lots of different treatments. Swordfish, for example, is heavily 
sprinkled with crushed peppercorns, sauteed and served in a butter sauce subtly 
flavored with chives. In keeping with the fashion of the day, some fish get 
silly garnishes that are essentially tropical-fruit salad, like the the one 
(mango, was it?) that comes with grilled ahi. 
</P>
<P>
Shellfish is a specialty. There's an oyster bar ("raw bar," that is; a bit of 
New Orleans jargon hanging on), which accounts for most of the appetizers. They 
tend to be served plain, but there are also a few things such as mussels heaped 
with an oniony and very fresh salsa, which might, in fact, be a tiny bit too 
much for the mussels, depending on one's feeling about mussels. 
</P>
<P>
The salad featuring grilled prawns and remarkably creamy seared scallops is 
terrific, and the crab cakes are also very good, consisting of just about 
nothing but crab meat and green onions. They're served with a mustardy beurre 
blanc sauce dashed with hot paprika, but there are only four of these little 
cakes for $13.95. In fact, everything is pretty impressive here except the limp 
and flavorless "crispy calamari." 
</P>
<P>
The desserts, in particular, are terrific. Delmonico's claims that its creme 
brulee is the best in the country. Strong words, but this is extremely good 
creme brulee, very creamy with a paper-thin burnt sugar crust. The Key Lime pie 
has an aggressive lime flavor, and the obligatory chocoholic cake is 
extraordinarily chocolatey, positively gritty with chocolate. Tarte tatin 
deserves Delmonico's name "caramel apple tarte," the apples being soft and 
caramelized, tasting practically like dried apricots. 
</P>
<P>
Delmonico's is really better than the Ritz ever was. If only I knew how to get 
into one of those cozy booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmonico's Seafood Grille, 9320 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 550-7737. 
Open for lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner nightly. Full bar. Valet 
parking. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$60.

'NEAR DEATH' TELLS TRUTH ABOUT THE BIG LIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death is not a candy-colored, blitzkrieg of explosions, gunshots and plot 
conveniences to rub out the bad guys by the end of the hour. That is 
television's form of the Big Lie. 
</P>
<P>
Death is slow, painful, unexpected and, often -- considering its tragic 
consequences -- outrageously banal. That is the truth, and perhaps only the 
unflinching master of the documentary film, Frederick Wiseman, could put it on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
He has, with "Near Death," the longest (six hours), perhaps most elegantly 
powerful film Wiseman has ever made. It airs Sunday at 11 a.m. on KVCR Channel 
24 and at 1 p.m. on KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is saying a lot. With such epic, coolly conceived films as 
"High School" and "Law and Order," Wiseman has pushed the documentary form to 
the limit, inviting our eyes to view pockets of American life we've never seen 
-- or would prefer not seeing. 
</P>
<P>
This implies taboos, and we would still prefer averting our eyes from those 
suffering in an intensive care unit. The new film puts us inside the ICU ward 
at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, where Wiseman's cameras track the course of 
four seemingly terminal patients. 
</P>
<P>
The issues at the heart of "Near Death" unfold as slowly and as starkly as the 
patients' conditions. Both contain surprises: The doctors and nurses find, from 
time to time, the ethical and medical ground moving under their feet, and not 
all of the patients fade into inexorable deterioration. This is about being 
near death, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing gratuitous, then, not even when the camera ponders the families in the 
waiting room (they reportedly gave Wiseman permission to film so that others 
may better prepare for the grueling experience). Far from being a death watch, 
the film confronts medicine's most central current dilemma: Has advanced 
technology's ability to sustain life -- even when that life has no meaning or 
quality -- made a mockery of a doctor's life-preserving mission? 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Weiss (no first names are used), the ward's attending physician, and the 
staff around him spend astonishing amounts of time discussing this, or the 
immediate condition of the patient, or how best to gently break the bad news to 
the family. The fate of one patient -- Mr. Cabra, a 35-year-old father and 
victim of pulmonary fibrosis -- seems to push the physicians close to the 
psychic edge: Under the nervous laughter and the clinical chatter is a death 
rattle they can't quite ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman may not have intended it, but his film becomes the definitive rebuttal 
to the claim that doctors don't care. Dr. Taylor, a family physician, displays 
a remarkable bedside manner and sensitivity to people's emotional states. The 
picture of him huddled with families, having to decide whether the doctors 
should do "everything possible" or only "comfort measure" before death comes, 
is a picture in quiet heroism. 
</P>
<P>
But as Weiss laments at one point, what is "everything possible"? A doctor, he 
realizes, must maintain both hope and a sober sense of reality in the face of 
incurability. He says this too: "A lot of this is heavy flail for no gain." And 
the costs keep going up. Where, when will it end? 
</P>
<P>
Like a man who has stuck to his typewriter when all the world has gone digital, 
Wiseman has remained faithful to his form: black-and-white photography, shots 
that approach the duration of real time, and a sly taste for the unexpected. 
The ward becomes an enclosed world, so that when Wiseman's camera moves 
outside, it's a shock. And with the few, final, outdoor shots, Wiseman 
concludes with a paradoxical lifting of his metaphysical head and a resigned 
shrugging of his shoulders.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: 'LUCY' FANS WILL HAVE A BALL WITH CLASSIC COLLECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone loves Lucy -- including video companies, two of whom are releasing 
collections of classic moments from the late Lucille Ball's TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has just released the second batch of shows from its "I Love Lucy 
Collection." Priced at $14.98, Volumes 5, 6, 7 and 8 contain two programs each 
from the most enduringly popular TV series ever. Here's the rundown: 
</P>
<P>
Volume 5 -- "Lucy and Bob Hope" (1956) and "Lucy and Superman" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
Volume 6 -- "Pioneer Woman" (1952), in which Lucy and Ethel try to cope without 
modern appliances, and "The Camping Trip" (1953). 
</P>
<P>
Volume 7 -- "Never Do Business With Friends" (1953) and "The Courtroom" (1952), 
two shows with the usually friendly Ricardos and Mertzes battling it out for a 
change. The ferocity of their war in "The Courtroom" will probably startle fans 
who haven't seen this episode before. 
</P>
<P>
Volume 8 -- "The Ballet" (1952), another variation on the most typical "Lucy" 
plot, where she tries to break into show business, and "The Handcuffs," a wild 
till-key-do-us-part episode. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Goodtimes has just put out "A Tribute to Lucy" and "Lucy's Lost 
Episodes," two compilation tapes that run 80 minutes each yet cost only $9.95 
each. "Tribute" documents Ball's life and career and includes never-aired 
scenes from her post-"I Love Lucy" series "The Lucy Show." "Lost Episodes" 
features highlights from "I Love Lucy," "The Lucy Show," "The Lucy/Desi Comedy 
Hour" and "Here's Lucy" and Ball's appearances on other shows, such as "Toast 
of the Town," "What's My Line" and "The Bob Hope Show." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it's a slow week at the video store, with no notable new movies. 
Pop-music fans, however, can choose from these: 
</P>
<P>
"Paul McCartney: Put It There" (PMV, $24.95), a 65-minute video version of a 
documentary seen recently on Showtime cable. 
</P>
<P>
"Indigo Girls: Live at the Uptown Lounge" (CMV, $19.98), 69 minutes of singing 
by the new, folky female duo. TERRY ATKINSON

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: CD ALBUMS BY ROCK AND ROLL HALL-OF-FAMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight artists or groups who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame on Wednesday in New York City are featured on 74 albums that are available 
in compact disc, according to the December issue of the Schwann CD catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch: 62 of the albums are devoted to just five of the artists 
-- the Four Tops (15), the Kinks (16), Simon and Garfunkel (8), Frankie Valli 
&amp; the Four Seasons (7) and the Who (16). 
</P>
<P>
That leaves just five albums each for Bobby Darin and the Platters and only two 
for Hank Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
To make it worse for anyone trying to collect recordings by the inductees, the 
best Platters and Ballard CDs are extremely hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of a dozen record stores checked this week had the key Ballard CD 
("What You Get When the Gettin' Gets Good") and none had a copy of the 
Platters' "Golden Hits" in stock. Here's a guide to the best introductions to 
the new Hall of Fame members: 
</P>
<P>
Hank Ballard -- "What You Get When the Gettin' Gets Good" (Charly R&amp;B 
Records) -- Ballard may be best known today as composer of "The Twist," but his 
reputation in the '50s was built on a series of R&amp;B hits highlighted by the 
truly scandalous "Work With Me Annie" and "Sexy Ways." Bobby Darin -- The 
Ultimate Bobby Darin" (Warner Special Products) -- The Darin entry in Capitol's 
"Collector's Series" has some noteworthy material, but this 17-song package -- 
drawn from his excellent Atco recordings from the late '50s and early '60s -- 
showcases why he was inducted. Includes "Mack the Knife" and "Dream Lover." 
</P>
<P>
The Four Seasons -- "Anthology" (Rhino) -- There's a more ambitious, 50-song 
Rhino box titled "25th Anniversary Collection" also available, but this package 
should satisfy most fans. The material runs from "Sherry" and "Big Girls Don't 
Cry" in 1962 to "December, 1963 (Oh What a Night") in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The Four Tops -- "Anthology" (Motown) -- The two-disc set has 41 songs, 
including such Top 10 singles as "I Can't Help Myself" and "It's the Same Old 
Song." 
</P>
<P>
The Kinks -- "Greatest Hits" (Rhino) -- Even though 16 Kinks albums are in CD, 
some of the band's most distinguished collections (including "Arthur" and 
"Village Green . . . ") are still not availble in CD. These 18 songs, first 
released in the mid '60s by Reprise Records, range from "You Really Got Me" to 
"Dedicated Follower of Fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The Platters -- "Golden Hits" (Mercury) -- "Only You" remains the L.A. vocal 
group's signature song, but it wasn't one of the Platters' four No. 1 singles. 
The latter included "The Great Pretender" and "My Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "Greatest Hits" (Columbia) -- Among the titles in this 
remarkable 14-song package: "Mrs. Robinson," "The Boxer" and "Bridge Over 
Troubled Water." In recognition of the Hall of Fame induction, CBS is releasing 
this week a three-disc set that includes all five of the duo's studio albums. 
</P>
<P>
The Who's "Who's Better, Who's Best" (MCA) -- Lots of "greatest hits" 
alternatives available on this landmark band, but this 19-song album ("My 
Generation" to "Baba O'Riley") offers the best overview.

BENCH APPOINTEE'S DRUNK-DRIVING RECORD DISCLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald L. Johnson, appointed Wednesday to the San Diego Superior Court bench, 
said Thursday that he has been convicted twice of drunk driving and told Gov. 
George Deukmejian "about the whole thing" when seeking the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 52, the assistant San Diego city attorney, said he has not had a drink 
since the second conviction, about five years ago, and feels confident that his 
alcohol problem is in the past and will not affect his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that, in applying for a vacancy on the 71-member court, he and 
Deukmejian's appointments secretary, Terry Flanagan, had a "long discussion" 
about the convictions, after which Deukmejian was told. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Trowbridge, a spokeswoman for the governor, confirmed those briefings and 
said Thursday that, because "the problem" was "several years ago" and appears 
to be "completely resolved," Deukmejian "doesn't feel it will in any way affect 
performance on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Roark, president of the San Diego-area chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, said Thursday the group will not challenge the appointment because 
Johnson had "paid his dues." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said both convictions occurred in San Diego, the first 11 years ago and 
the second about five years ago. Neither case involved injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson received fines in both cases and, in the second, the choice of a day 
spent in public service in jail. He said he chose public service, mowing lawns 
and trimming hedges at a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
The second case made him realize that he had a "problem with alcohol," and he 
entered an outpatient treatment program. He said he has been sober since. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any benefit that can come of this, and obviously it's an 
embarrassment to me, it's that you can recognize a problem and do something 
about it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is expected to be sworn in next week. As a Superior Court judge, he 
will not preside over drunk-driving trials, which are heard in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnson said it is possible that he might hear civil cases in Superior 
Court that somehow involve drunk driving. In such an event, "I'm going to 
enforce the law as written by the Legislature, and my personal problems with 
alcohol aren't going to affect the way I handle the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been the assistant city attorney since 1988. For 17 years before 
that, he was a deputy city attorney specializing in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian appointed Johnson along with Thomas J. Whelan, 49, a deputy district 
attorney, and Wesley R. Mason III, 50, a family law specialist. The 
appointments completed the 18-judge court expansion announced last year.

SIERRA CLUB THREATENS TO STALL SEWAGE PLANT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The local Sierra Club chapter threatened Thursday to hold up the city of San 
Diego's tentative legal settlement with three other government agencies on 
construction of a $2.8-billion sewage system because the plan contains no 
meaningful water-conservation provisions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sierra Club's attorney conceded that it is still unclear whether the 
environmental organization, which has intervenor status in the complex 
litigation, can hold up a settlement among the city, the state Water Quality 
Control Board, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Sierra Club's position that, yes, it would not be appropriate for a 
consent decree to be executed without having the Sierra Club a signatory to 
it," said William Benjamin, a Sierra Club attorney. "But that decision has not 
yet been made." 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys maintain the opposite position -- that they can settle their 
differences on a construction timetable for the huge sewage system upgrading 
without the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club is entitled only to a hearing before 
U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster to press its objections, said James Dragna, a 
private attorney hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the four government agencies have reached a tentative agreement 
that calls for the city to complete the largest public works project in its 
history by Dec. 31, 2003. The settlement is the product of negotiations that 
began even before the federal and state agencies sued the city for missing a 
July, 1988, deadline for compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that all cities upgrade their sewage treatment systems to 
so-called "secondary standards," under which 85% to 90% of suspended solids are 
removed from the effluent before it is dumped in the ocean. The city's existing 
"advanced primary" treatment system removes 75% to 80% of the solids. 
</P>
<P>
City planners have drawn up a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion renovation project 
that includes the upgrading of the city's Point Loma treatment plant, another 
secondary treatment plant in the South Bay and six water reclamation plants 
around the city. The plants would yield as much as 135 million gallons of water 
each day for reuse on golf courses, parks and highway medians. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, the Sierra Club pressed its longstanding demand 
that the council reduce the 190 million gallons per day of effluent being 
treated at the city's Point Loma sewage plant to 100 million gallons daily by 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
That could be accomplished, the Sierra Club contends, by replacing every toilet 
in the Metropolitan Sewerage System with 1.6 gallon ultra-low volume toilets. 
The effort would allow for a drastic downsizing of the planned construction 
project and save ratepayers, who will foot the bill for the system, a 
substantial sum, Sierra Club members said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, the Sierra Club is offering a plan under which the city 
would reduce the total sewage flow by 50 million gallons daily within eight 
years, but only if it also devoted any fines for past sewage spills to a 
sizable water conservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is demanding the fines, which could total millions of dollars, as 
payment for sewage spills into local waterways dating back to 1983. No 
settlement has been reached on the penalties, which are the subject of separate 
negotiations and could be the basis of a separate trial before Brewster if no 
deal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The money could be used as sewage fee rebates or other forms of incentives to 
promote installation of the ultra-low-volume toilets, according to Sierra Club 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Besides saving money, the water conservation effort would create excess 
capacity in the system that could accommodate the sewage that will be generated 
by population growth, Emily Durbin, a Sierra Club member and plaintiff in the 
lawsuit, said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dragna, who agreed that the city endorses the Sierra Club's water 
conservation goals, nevertheless said that water conservation is "a whole 
separate issue" not appropriate for inclusion in a legal settlement concerned 
with sewage treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This document is the vehicle to require (the city's) waste water treatment 
system, not to dictate its water use or growth patterns," Dragna said. 
</P>
<P>
As engineers continue to design and build the system, they can tailor it toward 
a larger water conservation effort, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD TO VOTE ON USE OF BOOK SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo Beach elementary school trustees, at the urging of a conservative 
Christian parents' group, have scheduled a vote on the district's continued use 
of a series of readers some parents deem morbid and anti-Christian, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Impressions," a series of grade-school readers that are the basic reading 
texts for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders in Redondo Beach schools, will come 
before the school board at its Feb. 6 meeting, Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Parras said. 
</P>
<P>
The texts have come under fire nationwide from members of the religious right, 
who disapprove of the inclusion in the books of stories and poems about sorcery 
and magic. Critics have also charged that the books are morbid in tone. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach parents demanded last month that the district shelve the 
books. The board took the matter under advisement but, in interviews afterward, 
most board members said they had no intention of withdrawing the books.

REDONDO BEACH SUES FOR $2 MILLION OVER PIER'S COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Redondo Beach has filed a lawsuit against a San Pedro engineering 
firm alleging that it failed to properly design and inspect a pier that 
collapsed during a heavy storm nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Torrance Superior Court, the city contends 
that Don Hellmers Engineering did not design the pier, which was known as the 
Fishing Promenade, to withstand storms. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also alleges an inadequate inspection by the engineering company 
three months before the pier's collapse in April, 1988, which prevented the 
city from making necessary repairs. The city had asked for the inspection that 
January following a vicious, two-day storm that resulted in an estimated $17 
million in damage to King Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Hellmers Engineering, which advertises itself in the telephone book as 
specializing in harbor facilities, refused to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which charges Hellmers with negligence, breach of contract, fraud 
and deceit, seeks more than $2 million in damages. City Atty. Gordon Phillips 
said the city had no written contract with Hellmers and in pressing the suit 
must rely on an oral agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that Hellmers, which designed the pier in 1982, failed to 
adequately determine how far the pilings should be driven into the harbor 
bottom. The suit also contends that the company's design did not call for the 
pilings to be cross-braced. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, King Harbor was severely damaged after a combination of heavy 
rain, high tides and winds ravaged the popular recreation area. A large hotel 
and more than two dozen smaller businesses were damaged, and numerous boats 
sank. A dozen people were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
About four months later, another storm hit Southern California and the pier 
collapsed, causing further damage to several nearby businesses and surrounding 
piers. 
</P>
<P>
The pier, built in 1985 to connect the Monstadt and Horseshoe piers, has not 
been rebuilt.

ABSENT COUPLE SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IN EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple who embezzled as much as $150,000 from a San Pedro insurance agency 
were sentenced to four years in state prison Thursday. They have apparently 
fled Southern California and did not appear at the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Superior Court Judge Richard F. Charvat sentenced Georgia and James 
Mulchaheyto the maximum term and ordered them to pay $10,000 each to the owner 
of the insurance firm, Bernard O'Neal, under a state government code that 
orders restitution for certain crimes. "They were not sorry for what they had 
done, they were just sorry they got caught," O'Neal said. "The full amount of 
the loss will never be known, she screwed things up so much with those books." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, 87, said that he was pleased the couple received the maximum sentence 
but that it could not compensate for the loss to his business or the damage to 
clients' trust that he had built up in his 56 years in the insurance business 
in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys had pleaded no contest in July to a charge that they embezzled 
$34,000 from O'Neal's company, where Georgia Mulchahey worked as a bookkeeper 
and office manager. She used some of the money to help her husband open a 
competing San Pedro firm, Marina General Insurance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for O'Neal said they have documented evidence of theft of more than 
$150,000 from the company. 
</P>
<P>
The Mulchaheys' attorneys, Henry Salcido and Dennis Carroll, argued that the 
couple did not deserve the maximum sentence because they had been repentant and 
had been willing to make some restitution to O'Neal, but were later frightened 
into fleeing by the prosecutor's repeated requests that they serve time in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Charvat said the factors in the couple's favor, including their plea of no 
contest, were not enough to outweigh their crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a very serious crime with a very vulnerable victim who has suffered 
a great loss," Charvat said. 
</P>
<P>
Private investigator Robert B. Ridley Jr. testified that in trying to find the 
couple, he found a deed filed with the county recorder's office indicating that 
O'Neal had deeded a property on 9th and Gaffey streets in San Pedro, worth as 
much as $1 million, to James Mulchahey on Sept. 22. The document bore O'Neal's 
signature, but O'Neal later testified that it was forged. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Barry, an attorney representing O'Neal in civil proceedings, said she now 
would seek to recover some of O'Neal's losses. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective Steve Wynn testified Thursday that officials in a number of 
South Bay cities have been notified that the couple is wanted, and authorities 
have also circulated information as far away as Texas and Homewood, Ala., where 
the couple's son lives.

ANTI-GANG GROUP FORMS AFTER STUDENT'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster parents and government officials have formed an anti-gang 
organization in response to the Antelope Valley's first gang slaying two weeks 
ago, when a stray bullet killed an Antelope Valley High School senior outside a 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively named the Committee Against Gang Activity, the organization held 
its first meeting Thursday night at Lancaster City Hall to discuss ways of 
combatting the growing gang presence in the Antelope Valley. The wide-ranging 
group includes Lancaster City Council members, school officials, ministers, 
parents and students, said Chairman Dennis Bogard, a Los Angeles Fire 
Department paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of gangs in the high desert over the last three years -- and the 
accompanying graffiti and violence in streets and schools -- had not gone 
unnoticed amid the area's rapid growth, Bogard and others said. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the death of Chris Sanford, a high school soccer player and 
innocent bystander, has shocked the community into action. Sanford was killed 
when a gang member fired into a crowd outside a Lancaster house party after a 
confrontation in which another man was shot and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what really set this off," said Councilman George Theophanis, who along 
with Councilman Arnie Rodio is working with the committee. "It's terrible that 
the tragedy happened. Maybe something good will come out of this." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives are looking for a 15-year-old Sylmar youth who has been 
charged in Sanford's murder. He is described as a member of a Sylmar gang 
affiliated with a gang based in the Quartz Hill area west of Lancaster, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Gary Vance, commander of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station, said he 
hopes the new organization will spread information. Residents, he said, have 
been "in the denial stage," as evidenced by poor turnout at a community seminar 
on gangs late last year. The station's six-deputy gang intelligence unit will 
add a deputy next month, an increase approved before the shooting, Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing pretty well in catching the gang members," he said, noting 
that intelligence gathered by the unit helped identify the suspect in Sanford's 
death. "We need information. We don't need vigilantes. We need to keep the 
focus on the problem. We need the understanding that if we stop your kid and we 
talk to him that doesn't necessarily label him a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
Bogard and others said emotions and tempers are high in the Antelope Valley as 
the result of Sanford's death, so the citizens group will make a point of 
discouraging any semblance of vigilante-type actions. The group will work to 
foster communication with authorities about gang activity, toughen discipline 
in schools, and provide education for parents and alternative programs for 
teen-agers, Bogard said. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley High School teacher Monica D'Errico said the committee must 
also fight the notion that the spread of gangs is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat and talked to a hard-core gang member," who attends the school, D'Errico 
said. "Her parents were gang members. She told me 'There's nothing you can do. 
You can't stop it. . . .' That might be true, but we can't just sit back and do 
nothing."

WEEKEND FORECAST IS FOR COLD WITH SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The forecast this weekend is up for grabs. After charting a stormy week of 
rain, snow and cold, it's as if the computer at the National Weather Service 
decided, "Enough already!" 
</P>
<P>
There will be a 30% chance of rain tonight and Saturday, and icy nighttime 
temperatures should frost car windshields in most parts of the county, but any 
additional weekend weather particulars are sketchy, said forecaster Wilbur 
Shigehara. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be on the very edge of a storm that is the worst kind to predict," 
Shigehara said. "The storm coming in is beginning to break apart, and it 
appears that its center wants to go off the coast rather than on the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said, however, that strong winds west of the storm center may push 
the storm closer to the coast and bring rain. 
</P>
<P>
"All our satellite pictures suggest no rain," Shigehara said. "Our computer 
says, 'No rain.' I want to say there will be a 30% chance of rain, just in 
case." 
</P>
<P>
One thing for certain is the continuing cold. At the city's request Thursday 
night, San Diego Life Ministries, the St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center and 
the Salvation Army expanded their shelter services to accommodate more homeless 
people against the frosty night air. 
</P>
<P>
For the second night this week, the County Office of Disaster Preparedness on 
Thursday opened the El Cajon Armory and the Vista Armory when temperatures 
dipped into the mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
Under partly cloudy skies, daytime highs today countywide will range from 57 to 
62 degrees, Shigehara said. Temperatures along the coast and inland Saturday 
and Sunday will warm a couple of degrees, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight lows along the coast tonight and Saturday will range from 40 to 50 
degrees, Shigehara said, and inland lows will range from 35 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the coldest agricultural areas, including Escondido, Bonsall and 
Valley Center, night temperatures are expected to dip to 27. Growers may need 
to turn on wind machines and monitor crops this weekend, but the cold does not 
warrant a frost advisory, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol Thursday advised people traveling to the 
mountains this weekend to use snow chains on county roads S6 and S7 to Mt. 
Palomar; Sunrise Highway to Mt. Laguna; California 79 to Cuyamaca; and 
California 78 through Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara ended a traveler's advisory for the mountains, but cautioned 
motorists to be on the lookout for icy roads, particularly at night. 
</P>
<P>
"The snow will start to melt just a little during the day, and then ice over 
the roads at night," he said. "This could make driving up there at night very 
slippery, very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Skies will be partly cloudy in the mountains through Sunday, and there is a 20% 
chance of snow showers on Saturday, Shigehara said. The snow is at the 
6,000-foot-level. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs in the upper 30s to low 40s are forecast. Overnight lows will be 
22 to 30 tonight and 24 to 32 Saturday night, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs this weekend will struggle to see the low 60s. Overnight lows will 
be from 35 to 45 tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean is 58 degrees. The surf is at 2 to 4 feet.

ROHRABACHER, FELANDO SEEN VULNERABLE ON ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All went swimmingly for GOP Congressman Dana Rohrabacher last week at a public 
meeting in heavily Republican Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmingly, that is, until the abortion issue surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"If the majority of the women in the Republican Party and the men feel that you 
should give us freedom of choice . . . don't you feel that you should represent 
us?" asked Barbara Gleghorn, a Republican on the board of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula League of Women Voters. Rohrabacher, who had been rapped by several 
others in the audience for seeking to outlaw abortion, snapped: "If the 
majority of people in my district, even by a great majority, believe that I 
should kill a baby, I would say that we should not make it legal." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and state Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro), two 
of the South Bay's staunchest abortion opponents, are up for reelection this 
year. Though both are ensconced in Republican districts, potential rivals from 
other parties are hoping that the rekindled abortion issue could cost the 
incumbents GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
So far, two would-be challengers, a Democrat and a Libertarian, have said they 
will run for Felando's seat. Three others -- all Democrats -- have said they 
plan to take on Rohrabacher. All describe themselves as "pro-choice" on 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
And all but the Libertarian say they expect to make major headway with the 
issue of abortion -- a prominent election issue since the U.S. Supreme Court 
handed down the Webster decision July 3, giving states greater flexibility to 
restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Rohrabacher's extreme positions make him very vulnerable, 
particularly with reference to abortion," said Guy Kimbrough, one of the 
Democrats planning to run for his seat. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Marilyn Landau, a former Los Angeles Teachers Union vice president who 
intends to challenge Felando: "Pro-choice is my biggest reason for running. I'm 
concerned about what happened with the Supreme Court decision and think we need 
to have more pro-choice opinion in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
At Rohrabacher's Town Hall meeting in Palos Verdes Estates, several Republicans 
voiced concern that dissatisfaction with the congressman's position could cause 
defections from their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Field, saying she was speaking for "a lot of mainstream Republican women" 
who object to Rohrabacher's support for government-imposed curbs on abortion, 
drew strong applause when she said: "We feel you may self-destruct." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unrest, local Republican organizers express confidence that Felando 
and Rohrabacher are in no immediate danger. For the largely conservative voters 
in both districts, they say, support for the incumbents' conservative voting 
records will outweigh any qualms about their stands on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the voters in those two districts will consider their entire records, 
and 99 cases out of 100 will agree with them," said Steve Johnson, director of 
the Republican Party of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's and Felando's anti-abortion credentials are unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, his first in Congress, Rohrabacher took the anti-abortion position 
in all seven abortion-related votes by the full House. In one, he voted against 
overriding President Bush's veto of a bill that would have lifted restrictions 
on federally funded abortions in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
The override attempt failed. As a result, federal money can be used to pay for 
abortions only when the pregnant woman's life would be endangered by carrying 
the fetus to term. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Webster decision was handed down, Rohrabacher joined a group of 
House and Senate members in calling on the Supreme Court to use the case to 
overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973, which established a 
woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, meanwhile, has voted consistently to restrict state funding of 
abortions. Observers say he has opposed abortion more actively than the other 
two South Bay state legislators who have voted with the anti-abortion camp -- 
Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) and Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-San 
Pedro). 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the whole (South Bay) group, probably the strongest anti-abortionist is 
Felando," said David Alois, director of the Planned Parenthood Affiliates of 
California, a group that advocates abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Elder is up for reelection this year, but Beverly is not. With the start of the 
candidate filing period still more than three weeks away, it is difficult to 
tell who, if anyone, may challenge Elder. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, no one has collected voter petition forms as a first step 
toward qualifying to run for Elder's 57th Assembly District seat, according to 
the county registrar-recorder's office. (Candidates can avoid paying steep 
filing fees for public office if they gather a minimum number of voter 
signatures instead.) 
</P>
<P>
Two people, however, are circulating petitions in hopes of competing for 
Felando's 51st Assembly District seat -- Landau, the Democrat, and William 
Gaillard, a member of the Libertarian Party. 
</P>
<P>
Three people planning to run for Rohrabacher's 42nd Congressional District seat 
have taken out petitions -- all of them Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
They are Kimbrough, a community college instructor from Orange County whom 
Rohrabacher defeated in the 1988 general election; Jim Cavuoto of Torrance, 
publisher of a computer industry newsletter, and Rolling Hills Estates resident 
Bryan Stevens, former president of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although several of these would-be candidates admitted that they have personal 
qualms about abortion, all five said they strongly support leaving abortion 
decisions to pregnant women and their physicians -- not to the government. 
</P>
<P>
All but Gaillard said they favor some degree of public funding for abortion. 
And all but Gaillard consider the abortion issue their most important entree 
into what might otherwise be hostile Republican territory. 
</P>
<P>
"The abortion issue is going to be the key issue," said Stevens, who headed the 
teachers union from 1973 to 1975, referring to the 42nd District congressional 
race. "Republican women think (Rohrabacher's position) is ridiculous, and 
they're going to vote for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough said one of his volunteer staff members is working exclusively on 
contacting abortion rights groups for endorsements and campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the faith in the abortion issue, any non-Republican challenging 
Rohrabacher or Felando faces an uphill battle at best. A key reason is party 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
As of September, 1989, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 89,331 to 
61,573 -- a 53% to 36% advantage -- in Rohrabacher's congressional district, 
which stretches from the South Bay beach cities to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Felando's Assembly district, which includes much of the South Bay's 
upper-income coastal territory, the GOP held a 95,519 to 67,453 advantage over 
Democrats -- or 52% to 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers like these complicate the already difficult task of beating an 
incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Financing is another factor working in Felando and Rohrabacher's favor. The 
likely challengers are not well known. They could have trouble gathering the 
contributions needed to finance effective districtwide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
And that, coupled with the natural Republican advantage in the two districts, 
could prompt abortion rights groups to concentrate their resources on more 
promising races. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Schneider, director of the Southern California affiliate of the 
California Abortion Rights Action League, said the two South Bay legislative 
districts seem forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just beginning our targeting process, but I must say those races 
wouldn't be at the top of our list," Schneider said. "Those districts are 
solidly Republican." 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Joplin, state coordinator for the California branch of the National 
Organization for Women, said her organization may help finance opponents of 
Felando and Rohrabacher. She cited the changed political climate produced by 
the Webster decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Our previous political analysis no longer applies," she said. "So many people 
consider the issue of reproductive rights so important." 
</P>
<P>
Felando and Rohrabacher said they feel confident that their abortion stands 
will not jeopardize their reelection bids. 
</P>
<P>
Felando predicted that the abortion issue will cost him few, if any, votes. He 
said that while surveys show most of his district's voters believe that women 
have a right to have an abortion, most also oppose public financing of 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident," Felando said. "If there is an effect (from the abortion 
issue), it's going to be very, very small." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher said: "I think my position on abortion will cost me votes." But he 
added: "I'm confident people will take into consideration my overall voting 
record rather than having one issue make the difference."

HUSBAND IS GUILTY OF TRYING TO KILL MAN HE SAID WAS WIFE'S LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
A jealous husband who pumped three bullets into the man he thought was having 
an affair with his wife was found guilty of attempted murder Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for Henry Ngo Wu, 33, was set for Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, by 
Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook. The maximum penalty is life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Wu, an El Monte real estate appraiser, stalked and shot Jonathan Baron, a vice 
president of CCH Computax Inc., the nation's largest computer tax processing 
firm. The attack took place last April 7 in the parking lot of the firm's 
national headquarters in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Baron, 37, formerly an avid runner, is confined to a wheelchair after being 
shot just below the chest, in a thigh and the buttocks. He testified that he 
never had an affair with Wai Wu, wife of Henry Wu, who had worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
There was no dispute that Wu shot Baron. 
</P>
<P>
Wu's defense admitted that Wu, who had contracted gonorrhea, thought he had 
gotten it from his wife and suspected Baron of having an affair with her. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that personal revenge for marital infidelity is a cultural tradition 
for Wu -- an ethnic Chinese who emigrated from Vietnam -- the defense contended 
that Wu sought merely to wound Baron to cause him to lose face, not to kill 
him. 
</P>
<P>
At trial, Wu testified he wanted to shoot Baron in the genitals, according to 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The defense presented an expert on Chinese culture to bolster its argument. 
But, on cross-examination, Eugene Cooper, a USC professor of anthropology, 
testified that a man in Wu's position would want to kill someone believed to be 
having an affair with his wife, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, (the cultural argument) helped my case," Hall said. "It was an 
uphill battle for the defense." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the verdict, Baron said, "I have absolutely no idea how 
my name got associated with this . . . because I can tell you honestly and 
openly that there was no affair going on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a jealous husband who got a crazy idea in his head and 
plotted for more than 14 months to take my life, totally unknown to me." 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year after the attack, Baron, whose spinal chord was partially severed 
in the attack, goes to therapy every day to strengthen weakened leg muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to bring me back to where I was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Wu relationship appears to be holding up. 
</P>
<P>
At the trial, Wu's wife invoked her spousal privilege not to testify against 
her husband. In a hearing out of the presence of the jury, she said the couple 
remains married. 
</P>
<P>
Wu testified that his wife visited him every weekend in jail, Hall said.

WEEKENDER: DISAPPEARING COASTAL MUD FLATS ARE 'THE HABITAT OF THE OVERLOOKED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Gerald Faris What: "Mud Flats: Cradle of Life." Where: Cabrillo Marine

<P>
When it comes to nature's ugly ducklings, coastal mud flats are probably near 
the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
The land is marshy, the vegetation scrubby and the brackish water isn't 
anything people would care to take a dip in. The mud flats are replete with 
decaying materials and carry a distinctive smell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest about it. They stink," said Ed Mastro, exhibit curator at the 
Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
But, though they're not pretty, mud flats are a vital part of the coastal life 
system, Mastro said. And that is the point that a new permanent exhibit at the 
museum tries to make. 
</P>
<P>
As visitors learn, mud flats are cradles of life for more than 50 species of 
fish, including fingerlings of the common halibut and turbot, which live there 
for the first three years of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Also called wetlands or estuaries, mud flats provide a feeding ground for 100 
species of birds, including migratory birds that winter there and permanent 
residents such as gulls, sandpipers, terns, plovers and others. 
</P>
<P>
Flying birds leave no doubt that mud flats support life, but many other 
creatures that call them home -- the burrowing clams, worms, snails, sea slugs, 
crabs and shrimp -- are all but invisible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the habitat of the overlooked," said Mastro, standing in the midst of the 
exhibit, which tells the story of mud flats through examples of the birds and 
other animals that live there. Various displays show the spawning and food 
systems of fish and birds, and one explains how burrowing creatures exist 
beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Mastro confesses that some of the critters aren't exactly beautiful, noting 
that one sea slug in the exhibit is downright disgusting in the way it digests 
entire snails for nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the exhibit is "Mud Flat Metropolis," a revamped aquarium that 
simulates the shore and watery areas of a mud flat, complete with old bottles 
and tennis shoes like those that people toss into the water. Fish swim amid 
strands of eel grass, foraging for food. 
</P>
<P>
Mastro said that for many people, the exhibit is an introduction to the 
richness and complexity of mud flats: "Most people think there's nothing 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Lamantia, a visitor from Sacramento, was one who discovered something 
new about his world. "I never realized how many living things there are down 
there, how many things are alive," he said. "It makes you afraid to take a 
step." 
</P>
<P>
Mud flats occur at points where rivers carrying sediment flow into oceans, 
creating a marsh sheltered from the waves. They once dotted the coastline of 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, but according to the museum, mud flats have 
been reduced since 1900 to one-fifth of their original area, through various 
kinds of development. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the kinds of places people like to cover over with boat slips and 
parking lots," Mastro said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest remaining nearby mud flats, he said, are 750 acres in Upper Newport 
Bay and 900 acres within the Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington once had a 3,500-acre estuary, Mastro said, but it was destroyed to 
develop Los Angeles Harbor. A 3.5-acre example of what once existed has been 
restored near the museum, but it has not yet been opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will present a special program built around the mud flats exhibit on 
Feb. 10 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. A talk at the museum will be followed by a field 
trip to the Newport mud flat. The cost is $12. 
</P>
<P>
Mastro said the decades-long destruction of mud flats has played havoc with 
creatures that depend on them. The light-footed clapper rail, Belding's 
savannah sparrow and the California least tern are all on the federal 
endangered species list because of this destruction. But he said the ecology 
movement has prompted people to support preservation and enhancement of the 
habitats that remain. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we have a role in that," Mastro said. "Our goal is to show that 
there's a lot of stuff living in mud flats." Gerald Faris What: "Mud Flats: 
Cradle of Life." Where: Cabrillo Marine Museum, 3720 Stephen White Drive, San 
Pedro. When: Saturday, Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesday through Friday, noon

STUDENT WOUNDED WHEN GUN DISCHARGES IN BOYS' 'HORSEPLAY'

A student at a Roman Catholic high school in Gardena was shot by a friend in a 
freak accident Wednesday afternoon when a gun accidentally discharged while 
several students were "horsing around" in a parked car, Gardena police said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age boys -- whose names were withheld -- then lied to authorities and 
said their friend was a victim of a drive-by shooting, police said. They later 
changed their story. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in the case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
One student is in serious but stable condition at County Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center, police said. Two others have been suspended from Serra High School and 
face a disciplinary hearing with their parents next week, said Principal James 
Crowell. 
</P>
<P>
"The students will be dealt with rather severely by the school," Crowell said. 
He called the incident "a very isolated, rare thing" that has never happened in 
the school's 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell said he explained the shooting to students over the school's public 
address system Thursday morning and told them "that this is not what we expect 
from our students." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the automatic pistol accidentally fired after falling from a 
student's jacket pocket while they were "horsing around" about 2:30 p.m. near 
the high school at 14830 Van Ness Ave. When the student with the gun picked up 
the weapon, the victim pushed it away and accidentally deactivated the safety 
release. The gun then fell to the floor and discharged. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really a shooting as you think of a shooting," Crowell said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the incident was serious, but bristled at the publicity 
the 265-student religious school is receiving because of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"If this happened two miles away, the school would not have entered into it. If 
the gun had not fallen down and discharged and hit the student, nobody would 
have known," he said.

CASE DROPPED IN DAMAGE TO EMPTY HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: VANDALISM CHARGES AGAINST THREE TEEN-AGERS WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE 
KEY WITNESS DISAPPEARED.

<P>
A San Fernando Municipal Court judge dismissed felony vandalism charges against 
three Valley teen-agers Thursday because the key witness against them has 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Byrd, 18, of Granada Hills and Kayron Kadjar, 18, and John Walker, 19, 
both of Sepulveda, were accused of causing $10,000 to 20,000 worth of damage to 
an empty Northridge house during a party there Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin Johnson, 21, one of the party-goers and the only witness who can 
identify the defendants, has been missing since December. Without his 
testimony, prosecutors do not have sufficient evidence to proceed with the 
case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Aveis told Judge Stephen A. Marcus in court 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Aveis said Johnson "went underground" the day after receiving an intimidating 
phone call from Kadjar's father. But Shapoor Kadjar denies ever speaking to 
Johnson. He said Johnson is afraid of police who threatened to beat him up if 
he did not testify in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Shapoor Kadjar said Johnson told a private investigator that his son was not 
responsible for the damage, but that police officers were pressuring Johnson to 
testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Byrd, Kadjar and Walker, and three juveniles on suspicion of 
breaking windows and kicking holes in the walls and doors of a home on Van 
Alden Street. Police said the youths were attending one of the large house 
parties that sometimes attract hundreds of teen-agers in the West Valley. But 
Kadjar said his son was not in the house at the time. 
</P>
<P>
An advertising flyer said the party would last from "7:30 until the cops come" 
and that guests would be asked for $3 to buy beer and pay for a disc jockey. 
Police said guests were allowed in free because there was no beer or disc 
jockey. They said some teen-agers, angry because there was no beer or music, 
began to vandalize the house.

7 BUSINESSES CITED IN LIQUOR SALES; 
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL: SIX PACOIMA BARS AND A DRIVE-UP DAIRY OUTLET WERE REFERRED TO CITY 
OFFICIALS IN AN EFFORT TO CURB DRUNK DRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police this month referred six Pacoima bars and a Sylmar drive-up 
dairy to city zoning officials in a continuing crackdown on businesses they say 
contribute to drunk-driving accidents in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima bars were accused of serving intoxicated customers and hiring 
B-girls who encourage male patrons to buy drinks. The dairy store allegedly 
sold alcohol to a minor. Sgt. Rick di Stefano, a vice supervisor in the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division, said Thursday that he had named 
the businesses in a Jan. 3 letter to the city's Office of Zoning 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The actions were part of a continuing campaign against public drunkenness in 
Pacoima. The Foothill Division -- which includes Pacoima and Sylmar -- has led 
the city in alcohol-related traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
In December the Los Angeles City Council ruled that three Pacoima stores could 
no longer sell cold beer or wine, single cans or small bottles of alcoholic 
beverages. The council also required earlier closing times for the stores. The 
council acted after police and zoning officials heard complaints from nearby 
residents and found evidence that drunkenness and crimes stemmed from liquor 
sales at these stores. 
</P>
<P>
Di Stefano said officers believe the additional businesses targeted this month 
continued to serve intoxicated patrons, based on interviews with suspects 
arrested on alcohol-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason why we've been hitting these bars," he said. "We wanted to 
get to the root of the problem. We've talked to them over and over again. It 
still goes on because there's a tremendous profit" in alcohol sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima bars cited by police are El Capri, El Norteno and El Parian, all on 
Van Nuys Boulevard; El Palenque and El Michoacano, both on San Fernando Road; 
and the New Top Hat Bar on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Also cited was the 
Alta-Dena drive-up dairy on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for El Parian declined to comment. Owners or managers of the other 
businesses could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
To curb abuses, the city can impose new zoning restrictions on such businesses, 
including limiting their hours, requiring them to use state-licensed security 
guards and prohibiting B-girls, said associate zoning administrator Jon Perica, 
who received di Stefano's letter. 
</P>
<P>
If undercover officers continue to find illegal activity, the city can shut 
down a business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perica said the Los Angeles City Council in December upheld his decision to 
place two liquor stores and a food market, all in Pacoima, on six-months 
probation in an earlier crackdown on businesses considered a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is awaiting a Jan. 31 council vote that would pay for more zoning 
staff members to investigate the latest seven businesses targeted by Foothill 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
The same seven are also facing administrative charges by the state Department 
of Alcohol and Beverage Control, said F.J. (Jim) Smith, the ABC's Van Nuys 
district administrator. He said the ABC has already suspended licenses at two 
of the bars -- El Capri and El Norteno -- for serving obviously intoxicated 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC can seek suspension or revocation of a license to serve alcohol, but 
Smith said city zoning officials have broader authority and can crack down on a 
business more quickly.

Two Los Angeles County men have been indicted on cocaine trafficking charges 
that involved a sale that was mostly drywall plaster. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, Nestor Martinez, 37, of Downey and Arcesio Escobar-Benitez, 32, 
of Sherman Oaks, have pleaded not guilty and were ordered held without bail in 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Amalia Meza said Thursday that the defendants were 
arrested Jan. 9 after showing an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent several suitcases purportedly containing 330 pounds of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Meza said an analysis of the material showed it contained 13 pounds of the drug 
and mostly drywall plaster for the rest.

SMALL PLANE CRASHES IN BURBANK; 4 ABOARD DIE;

AVIATION: THE CRAFT HAD JUST TAKEN OFF AND WAS TRYING TO RETURN TO THE FIELD. 
INSTEAD, IT WENT DOWN NEXT TO A PARKING LOT.

A light plane that apparently developed mechanical trouble after taking off 
from Burbank Airport tried to return Thursday, but crashed and exploded in 
flames beside a parking lot, killing all four people aboard, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Police Officer Joseph Canaan said the plane crashed on Lockheed Corp. 
property next to Parking Lot A, a long-term parking facility on Hollywood Way 
at Winona Avenue, about 8:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The dead were not immediately identified. There appeared to be no injuries on 
the ground, Canaan said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a single-engine Piper Cherokee PA-28, had just taken off toward the 
west when the pilot radioed that he needed to return immediately, said Jerry 
Acosta, a Federal Aviation Administration regional duty officer. 
</P>
<P>
The plane took off and rose "maybe 50 to 100 yards into the air," said Ed 
Der-Avakian of Arcadia, who was driving out of Lot A. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't going any higher," he said, and then the aircraft began to 
circle back, approaching the airport from the east. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew something was going to happen because it just wasn't going up," 
DerAvakian said. "It just came right in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
Skimming the rooftops of vehicles in the parking lot, the plane smashed down on 
Lockheed Corp. land just north of the lot and crumpled against a fence, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later the plane exploded in flames, Der-Avakian said. 
</P>
<P>
James Pinon, a dispatcher for Aircraft Service International, told United Press 
International that he spoke with a pilot who monitored the radio transmissions 
of the Piper just before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard the pilot talking on the radio trying to bring it down," Pinon said. 
"The guy was taking off and he was trying to come back down because he had 
engine problems." 
</P>
<P>
Pinon, whose office is about 250 yards from the crash site, said he heard the 
plane crash, but did not hear the whine of a distressed engine before the 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta said the plane crashed about 1,000 feet east and about 300 feet north of 
the approach end of the east-west runway. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from the Lockheed and Burbank fire departments extinguished the 
flames, airport police said. Only a small pile of charred metal remained.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT INJURED AFTER OFFICER'S GUN 
DISCHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old unarmed Norwalk man was critically wounded Thursday when a 
sheriff's detective's revolver went off accidentally as the officer tried to 
stop the man from driving away in a stolen pickup in Bellflower, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say Scott Fierro was driving the same stolen truck Wednesday when 
he allegedly threatened a K-Mart security guard with a knife when the guard 
tried to stop him from leaving with $100 worth of stolen drill bits. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives spotted Fierro in the truck in a parking lot on Rosecrans Avenue on 
Thursday, Deputy Dean Scoville said. Believing that Fierro was going to rob the 
market, officers surrounded the truck and ordered him out. Instead, Scoville 
said, Fierro put the truck in reverse, throwing the deputy who was holding onto 
the passenger side off balance. His gun went off and the bullet struck Fierro 
in the chin.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MANY CITIES FAIL TO MEET QUAKE SAFETY 
STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fewer than half of the 29 cities in the San Gabriel Valley have met a state 
deadline for complying with an earthquake safety law to make unreinforced 
masonry buildings less hazardous, a report shows. 
</P>
<P>
The number, included in a report released last week by the state Seismic Safety 
Commission, reflects a 43% compliance rate statewide. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires cities and counties in earthquake zones to notify owners of 
brick buildings constructed before 1933 that the structures may be unsafe and 
to adopt safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
Only 14 San Gabriel Valley cities have fully complied with the law's Jan. 1 
deadline. In some of the other 15 cities, a lack of building experts and a 
number of historical landmarks contributed to their failure to comply.

BILL BOYARSKY: COUNCIL'S CLASS WAR OVER REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A casual observer might not recognize the Los Angeles City Council's hostility 
to the proposed municipal ethics law as class warfare, but that's just what it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
The law would create a city ethics commission to enforce rigorous new rules 
governing campaign financing, and define and prohibit conflicts of interest. It 
would apply to a number of top city officials, including the council members. 
</P>
<P>
The hostility comes more from the council members' dislike of Westside 
reformers than from their fear of being watched by ethics cops. The symbolic 
target of their hostility is an affluent neighborhood around San Vicente 
Boulevard that happens to be the home of several prominent and rich activists 
in reform politics -- Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
To council members, who consider themselves the blue-collar workers of 
politics, Brentwood means affluent goat-cheese-and-sun-dried-tomato-loving 
dilettantes imposing their arrogant notion of a moral code of behavior on men 
and women struggling to survive on the assembly line of public life. "The 
Brentwood perspective," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called it. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, other reasons why council members oppose the proposed 
ethics patrol. Some council members walk perilously close to the outer limits 
of ethical standards. Lobbyists for politically generous land developers are 
welcomed in council offices while unknown constituents beg for appointments. 
But that's not the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics code was written by a citizens' committee appointed by Mayor Tom 
Bradley after he got caught in political scandal. The commission head, Geoffrey 
Cowan, a wealthy lawyer and political reform veteran, assembled a diverse group 
to do the work. It is not a commission of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the actual drafting of the code was done by a group of Westside 
attorneys who have been fighting for political reform for years. For Cowan, Bob 
Stern, Tracy Westen, John Phillips and a few others, this was a long-awaited 
chance to clean up a city political system they have long considered corrupt. 
Council members know them -- and resent their scorn. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than follow the example of the Ten Commandments or the Constitution -- 
strong but general language -- the attorneys, in lawyer-like manner, tried to 
spell out remedies for every possible political sin. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with this detailed set of rules, written by people they can't stand, 
it's no wonder even the most ethical council members rebelled. Three examples 
illustrate the point: 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter was elected as a reformer after slogging through the 
neighborhoods of Crenshaw, Mar Vista, Venice and Westchester. With strong 
grass-roots support, she defeated a better-financed incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has a reputation for being an honest public servant. That's why she 
objects to the idea of being under perpetual scrutiny when she hasn't done 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That same feeling motivated Councilman Joel Wachs, who joined with Yaroslavsky 
in winning approval of an amendment narrowing one portion of the code. Rather 
than banning all gifts and honorariums, the code now bars council members from 
accepting them from lobbyists or those dealing with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs was elected as a reformer in 1971, long before reform became fashionable. 
With his father's money and a large number of volunteers, Wachs beat a a 
well-financed, entrenched incumbent supported by developers. 
</P>
<P>
A third example involves a veteran council staff member who, like Wachs and 
Galanter, is considered to be an upright person. Cindy Miscikowski is the top 
aide to Councilman Marvin Braude, an ethics reform advocate who represents 
Brentwood. Her husband is Doug Ring, an influential lawyer-lobbyist for land 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, testifying before the council Wednesday, said the proposed code would 
force him to disclose the names of all his clients -- and those of the 29 other 
members of his firm. That's because the statute requires disclosure of income 
earned by an official's spouse. "I'd have to cease to participate in my law 
firm or cease to participate in my marriage," said Ring. 
</P>
<P>
Since Miscikowski is popular with council members, Ring's testimony had an 
impact. It fed the resentment of council members that they were being pushed 
around unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
That resentment fueled the council's last two days of debate and the result was 
a weakened campaign reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The reformers may have mastered the legal side of the ethics question. But they 
forgot that victory goes to those who understand that politicians are driven by 
the same complex motives that drive the rest of us.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISNEY PARK ADDS TWIST TO 710 FREEWAY 
DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The competition over a Walt Disney Co. theme park in either Long Beach or 
Anaheim has added a new twist in the decades-old controversy over the proposed 
extension of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the extension that would travel through East Los Angeles, 
Pasadena and South Pasadena said they hope that Long Beach officials, eager to 
attract the Disney park, will press for completion of the freeway's northern 
end in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And opponents said they are as determined as ever in their fight against it. 
</P>
<P>
The 710 Freeway could be one of Long Beach's selling points in winning the park 
and its 10,000 jobs. "This could lead to a renewed effort to see the gap 
closed," state transportation planner Jeffrey Bingham said of Long Beach's 
interest in attracting the $1-billion theme park to a site near the Queen Mary.

STUDENTS UNFAZED BY FILM ON TEEN DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Orlando Reneau stood motionless in the huge gymnasium, hands 
stuffed into the pockets of his drooping khaki pants, searching for some 
meaning in the dramatized carnage he had just seen. 
</P>
<P>
In re-enactments of scenes too often real for Reneau, a teen-age boy gunned 
down a rival; an ambulance rushed a bullet-riddled youth off to the hospital; a 
young girl sobbed relentlessly over the corpse of her murdered boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
As he had watched the U.S. Health Department film commentary on teen slayings 
with the nearly 100 other South Los Angeles residents at the Challengers Boys 
and Girls Club on Wednesday night, Reneau said, something had told him that he 
was supposed to be moved, that the make-believe bloodshed was meant to inform, 
to stun. 
</P>
<P>
But the 15-year-old remained strangely unfazed and none the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, a lot of it was true," Reneau said, shrugging and staring at the gym 
floor. "That's what's happening on the streets, but I knew that. It didn't 
scare me or anything. The message was that the streets are rough. Man, I knew 
that, too." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the reaction of many of the parents and teens who watched "Youth 
Homicide: A Public Health Issue," a film that deals with teen killings as a 
health crisis as well as a legal issue. 
</P>
<P>
It was interesting, they said, but in the end the film was just another 
palliative for the social problems plaguing their communities. 
</P>
<P>
The production, which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services filmed 
last year, pairs the disturbing murder re-enactments with comments from 
convicted killers and community activists on the social ills that fuel the 
steady increases in youth homicides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to stop thinking about youth homicide purely as an issue of criminal 
justice," said Mariam M. Bell, a Health Department spokeswoman, who attended 
the showing. "It is time to start considering it instead as a preventable 
public health problem. It is a problem that demands the immediate attention of 
each and every one of us." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she noted, more than 26,100 youths died in homicides. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said the film, which her department prepared in conjunction with the 
Howard University campus television station, premiered last year in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Among the activists honored and quoted in the film was Lou Dantzler, founder 
and executive director of the Challengers Club on South Vermont Avenue. 
Dantzler said he hoped the film, in which he describes the objectives of the 
club, would galvanize viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will have some impact," said Dantzler, whose organization has 
gained national attention for its work with Los Angeles youths ages 6 to 17. "A 
film like this is necessary because it makes you think." 
</P>
<P>
While some acknowledged that the film was poignant, they hastened to add that 
it only mirrored an environment they know well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here in this community every day, and I see what was shown in this film 
every day," said Occerita Oliver, who attended the showing with her 10-year-old 
daughter, LaTresha. "The children and some of their attitudes are the same. 
Some of these kids can't tie their shoes, but they can curse you out or hold a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
"The film didn't present anything new to me." 
</P>
<P>
Reneau and Robert Arias, 17, said that, despite the film's intentions, only 
concrete social programs could curb the teen-age violence that has wracked 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get out of that type of stuff by coming here," said Arias. 
"The club is helping us. The film was truthful, but the club gives us someplace 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lukewarm reactions from many in the audience, others said they were 
deeply touched by the film. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a real effect on me," said Dwyane Poole, 21, one of several Los Angeles 
Police Department Explorer Scouts who watched the program. "I thought about 
what it was like for me when I was out there on the streets. I could have been 
out there killing, or doing crime, because I didn't have anything to do."

STRANGULATION LISTED AS CAUSE OF DEATH OF DOCTOR'S ATTACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy report released Thursday concluded that a Pacific Palisades man died 
of strangulation during a struggle with a Santa Monica psychiatrist whom the 
74-year-old man attacked with acid, ropes and a gun in the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being treated as a homicide," Bob Dambacher, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office said of the death Tuesday of Arthur Waters. 
Initially, police were uncertain whether Waters died at the hands of 
psychiatrist George M. Seeds, or if Waters had died of sudden, natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Police Detective Shane Talbot reiterated Thursday that Seeds, 60, 
of Marina del Rey will not be arrested or charged with any crime. Seeds' action 
will be regarded as self-defense, unless the district attorney's office 
recommends otherwise, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our understanding of physical evidence, statements from Dr. Seeds and 
other witnesses, it is our belief that Dr. Seeds was defending himself," Talbot 
said. "It's a homicide, but we believe it was a justifiable homicide." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Waters had forced his way into Seeds' office, wrestled the doctor 
to the floor and threw acid on Seeds after attempting to tie him down. A 
struggle between the two men ensued, and Seeds called 911 after noticing that 
Waters had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said the case will be turned over to the district attorney's office for 
review. He said he expects the district attorney to make a decision about 
filing charges by the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds' condition on Thursday was upgraded from fair to good at the burn ward of 
Torrance Memorial Medical Center, where he is being treated for second- and 
third-degree burns on his face and body. 
</P>
<P>
According to neighbors, Waters had plotted the attack on Seeds because he 
believed that the doctor, who had treated Waters' wife, Mildred, for six months 
in 1984, was partly to blame for her suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Waters shot herself in the couple's Pacific Palisades apartment last 
April. Her husband blamed her worsening psychosis and muscle twitches on 
allegedly excessive dosages of drugs that psychiatrists had prescribed her over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
He told neighbors that he planned to hunt down and attack up to four different 
doctors who had treated her to call attention to his allegations.

SUPPORT POURS IN FOR LEWIS, WHO IS REINSTATED BY ASBURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the basketball season, Pepperdine's Tom Asbury was recalling his stormy 
first year of coaching one of the country's best small forwards, Tom Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had our moments, and we still do, in all honesty," Asbury said. "He'll 
question you. He'll tell you what he thinks. I like that. We will not let each 
other not communicate with each other. This is a real mistake with Tom. He has 
to be communicated with." 
</P>
<P>
Communication, however, broke down temporarily in the last week when Asbury 
indefinitely suspended his senior captain for missing a curfew along with three 
teammates after Thursday night's 88-78 victory at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after threats of student petitions, intervention from Pepperdine 
administration and calls from Lewis' former coaches, Jim Harrick and Stan 
Morrison, Asbury has reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
He announced Thursday that Lewis will be reinstated Monday. The 6-foot-7 
forward will have missed three games by the time he rejoins the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Asbury had said that Lewis had been suspended for cumulative 
incidents this season, but did not specify them. 
</P>
<P>
The others who had violated curfew, Craig Davis, Geoff Lear and Doug Christie, 
were not suspended, but were benched for the first five minutes of last 
Saturday night's game against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a John Wooden Award nominee, gave Asbury a letter of apology Tuesday and 
asked to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' reinstatement, however, might have been more the result of other 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wilkes, Pepperdine student body president, said that administrators had 
reprimanded Asbury's top assistant, Bob Williams, over the handling of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who caught the players violating curfew early Friday morning in a San 
Diego hotel, reportedly screamed profanities at Lewis before Lewis was ushered 
to his room by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine administrators refused to comment other than to announce the 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
But they were not the only ones concerned about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, San Jose State's coach who recruited Lewis at USC five years ago, 
said he had called Asbury to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
"I was interested in talking to Tom (Asbury) as a guy who sat in his chair 
before," Morrison said. "I felt I was looking at circumstances through 
different eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals can get stereotyped. Tom (Lewis) is a very interesting person, and 
like everyone, he carries some baggage with him. His baggage is very different 
than anyone else I've coached. Things that happen in a young person's life make 
them the way they are, and as a coach you've got to be aware of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury also had discussions with Harrick. Asbury was Harrick's assistant at 
Pepperdine for nine seasons before Harrick became UCLA's coach in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the coach to compromise," Harrick said from Palo Alto, where UCLA 
played Stanford Thursday night. "I think they got together and put their 
feelings aside, and did what is best for everybody involved . . . for the 
university, the players, Tom Lewis and Tom Asbury." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis declined to comment on the situation. Mike Zapolski, Pepperdine's 
athletic spokesman, said that Asbury and Athletic Director Wayne Wright also 
would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury, whose basketball philosophy is more structured than Harrick's, has had 
conflicts with Lewis since becoming Pepperdine's coach. Asbury asked the 
high-scoring Lewis to concentrate on rebounding, passing and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Asbury sent Lewis home from some practices. In a game against 
Gonzaga last January, Lewis was benched in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw we would do something about it if he didn't give us what we wanted," 
Asbury said last year. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Lewis averaged 36 minutes of playing time and 22.9 points under 
Harrick. This season, he is playing 27 minutes and scoring 12.5 points. Lewis 
was one of Pepperdine's assist leaders the past two seasons, and his rebounding 
average had increased. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' play this season has been hampered because of a dislocated finger that 
was surgically repaired. He played two games with 20 stitches in the finger. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, 20-13 in Asbury's first season, is 7-8 after losing to Santa Clara, 
72-70, last Saturday night. The Waves will play host to Portland tonight and 
Gonzaga Saturday night in West Coast Conference games at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has been controversial since he left Santa Ana Mater Dei High as an 
All-American in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
As one of California's most highly recruited athletes, Lewis decided to attend 
USC. But after Lewis' successful freshman season, Morrison was asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
When George Raveling was hired, Lewis and teammates Bo Kimble and Hank Gathers 
said they were not certain that they wanted to stay at USC. Raveling set a 
deadline for decisions by the three, then later announced that their 
scholarships would not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble and Gathers transferred to Loyola Marymount and Lewis said that he would 
transfer to UC Irvine, but eventually went to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis flourished in his first season at Pepperdine, where he developed a close 
relationship with Harrick and his family. Also, Harrick's fondness for 
wide-open offenses suited Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
But when Harrick left for UCLA, Lewis had no more options. The NCAA does not 
allow athletes multiple transfers, even when coaching changes occur. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom is one of the most unlucky Division I players I've ever seen," Morrison 
said. "How many players do you know who have had to make that many 
adjustments?"

SEVEN HOSPITALIZED AS PLAYERS, FANS, BAND ENGAGE IN BRAWL

A 15-minute, gymnasium-wide brawl during Thursday night's basketball game 
between North Carolina Central and North Carolina A&amp;T resulted in at least 
seven people being hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the fracas, about 300 fans were on the court, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said fighting, including the throwing of chairs, spread throughout 
the gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began with 8:04 left in the second half when Derrick Leak, a 
forward for visiting N.C. Central, was fouled by center Jimmy Humphries. The 
two players shoved each other and the situation quickly escalated into a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
At least one spectator, an unidentified member of the N.C. A&amp;T pep band, 
was removed from the court on a stretcher, officials said. "Even people from 
the A&amp;T pep band were fighting," N.C. Central sports information director 
Wallace Dooley said by phone. "They were hitting people with their 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Orby Moss, N.C. A&amp;T athletic director, pleaded in vain over the public 
address system for spectators to remain in their seats. The fighting continued, 
and Moss suspended the game with Division I N.C. A&amp;T leading, 39-38, 
against the defending NCAA Division II national champions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very scary," N.C. A&amp;T Coach Don Corbett said. "We could have 
had a full scale riot in there. I truly didn't see what happened. I saw a 
push." 
</P>
<P>
Dooley said a teleconference between school officials would be held today to 
discuss when -- or if -- the game would be played. "It was a hotly contested 
game between two rivals and it's a shame that the game couldn't be decided 
(Thursday night)," N.C. Central Coach Mike Bernard said. "It's a shame their 
fans didn't get the opportunity to see the whole ballgame."

JIM MURRAY: HE'S GOT THE WHOLE TOUR IN HIS HANDS

When young John Cook decided to come out on the golf tour, the game could 
hardly wait. Sponsors drooled. 
</P>
<P>
Handsome, blond, slim, he was as photogenic as a Hawaiian sunset. He had this 
great, gorgeous looping swing. He could putt an acorn into a shot glass. He had 
steady habits, he loved the game. Golf couldn't believe its good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf, no less, went to work recruiting him to play at 
their alma mater, Ohio State, although he had grown up in Southern California. 
He led the school to the NCAA championship, as they knew he would. 
</P>
<P>
He won the U.S. Amateur. He was a finalist another time. He won the World 
Junior. If he had a flaw in his game, no one found it. 
</P>
<P>
He won a tournament -- the Crosby -- before he had been a pro for a year. He 
won the Canadian Open. He was way up on the money list. Hall of Fame, here I 
come. 
</P>
<P>
Then something happened to Cook's tour to the top. He became erratic. The club 
seemed loose in his hands. The once crisp irons wobbled. The tee shots dived 
and sank. The scores soared. 
</P>
<P>
"Tournament nerves," the wise guys said. The kid found out the game wasn't all 
birdies and pars. The ball didn't have to go into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
John Cook thought it was something else. His hand felt funny, as if there were 
a bag of loose marbles in there. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors reassured him. A little tendinitis, they told him. Whatever was 
wrong wasn't in the hand. Just hit through it, they advised. 
</P>
<P>
John did. For seven years. He tried to keep up with the tour one-handed. Golf 
is tough enough with two. 
</P>
<P>
He played just brilliantly enough on occasions to cast doubt on his insistence 
that he was spotting the field one whole hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in his head," they whispered. "The doctors said so." 
</P>
<P>
So, the conclusion was, the game was just too tough for another fancy young 
college boy shot-maker. You need more than blond hair and purple slacks and a 
nice left-to-right fade to keep up in this game. Well of course you do. You 
need a right hand, too. Even Mike Tyson needs that. 
</P>
<P>
John Cook really didn't have one. But he had a tough job convincing the tour 
when he won $333,184 in 1987. How can you do that with your left hand? 
</P>
<P>
John Cook did. He led the tour in aspirin. He soaked his hand in the shower. He 
squeezed rubber balls. If it was all in his head, how come his knuckles swelled 
up? 
</P>
<P>
He finally began to notice that his right hand would bubble up like a saucepan 
of water on a hot stove. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Hey! Cysts don't move! They stay in one place and get 
hard,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
John's right hand got so he could play "Lady of Spain" with it. It wasn't a 
hand, it was castanets. Unfortunately, you couldn't play golf with it. 
</P>
<P>
The X-rays kept revealing nothing. His golf game was the only thing fractured. 
Maybe it was the grip. Maybe it was the guy. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the matter were, John Cook had all but shattered his hand hitting 
a ball off a tree root in the Inverrary tournament during his third year on 
tour in 1982. He was trying to play golf with a hand that he could hardly eat 
with. 
</P>
<P>
The human hand wasn't hinged to beat down on hard ground -- or tree roots -- 
with an iron club on a steel shaft. It can be like punching a concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
Cook finally took the problem to Dr. Steven O'Connell at the Eisenhower Medical 
Center, the facility that is, ironically, the major beneficiary of the annual 
Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
It was discovered the bone fragments were in John Cook's hand, not his head, 
after all. The reconstructive surgery was delicate. The doctor made no 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
"What he did say was that it would not be worse than it had been," Cook says. 
</P>
<P>
Even that was good enough for him. But it turned out to be a great deal better. 
First, though, Cook had to take almost an entire year off the tour. "It was 
great," he says. "My kids had a father, my wife had a husband, I had a home 
life. But it also made me appreciate how lucky we were to have the tour to make 
our living. Everyone should have an opportunity to step back and see where he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Cook, the tour recognizes the wear and tear that high stakes 
golf imposes on the system. Ordinarily, if a player has a year in which he wins 
no money -- actually John ended up 172nd on the money list in '89 -- or not 
enough money, he is off the tour. But in the case of a medical emergency, he 
keeps his place in line. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Cook didn't crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered how effective the surgery would be with the bone chips gone and the 
healing process over," Cook says. "So I entered the Kapalua tournament, hoping 
only that I could break 80. I actually broke par. Then I went to the Royal 
Melbourne and was actually in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Punching with both hands, John Cook was able to put Indian Wells on the ropes 
in the Hope Classic's opening round Wednesday. He was finally able to mount a 
two-fisted attack. 
</P>
<P>
You might say he landed a series of right hands to the tournament's jaw when he 
followed up his opening-round 65 with a second-round 68, which kept him in a 
tie for the lead and put him solidly into the category of the fighter of whom 
they used to say, "He can hurt you with either hand -- but kill you with both."

UNION, MANAGEMENT DISCUSS 'PARTNERSHIP' ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: REVENUE-SHARING PROPOSAL WOULD JOIN THE TWO ENTITIES, PERHAPS 
DIVIDING CONTROL OF GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To what extent would the Major League Players Assn. become a partner of 
baseball's owners if the union accepted the revenue-sharing plan proposed in 
the collective bargaining negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said he asked that question during 
Thursday's negotiations in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not be insisting on overall veto power, but if revenue were to be the 
sole determinant of salaries, then we would want to make sure revenues were 
maximized, and we would have to have some veto power over economic issues," 
Fehr said after the meeting. "We told them that they had to be prepared to 
abandon unilateral control." 
</P>
<P>
And the PRC's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have a direct response, but they understand how we feel," Fehr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, interim director of the PRC, said that the partnership 
inherent in revenue sharing translates to more input from the union. 
</P>
<P>
He cited marketing, merchandising and international expansion as areas in which 
union involvement might help increase the "economic pie." 
</P>
<P>
"Would they be involved in traditional management issues? No." O'Connor said. 
"But there are a lot of areas in which the union's involvement would help shape 
the industry's growth." 
</P>
<P>
The union has still not drafted a definitive response to the revenue-sharing 
proposal, Fehr said, nor has the PRC offered a "satisfactory explanation in 
real economic terms" of what the problems are that require such radical change. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he asked the PRC to present that explanation at its next formal 
negotiating session Wednesday in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Management has proposed that 48% of the clubs' gate and TV-radio income be 
shared with the players. The salaries of players with zero to six years of 
major league service would be determined by a statistical table and shared 
equally by the 26 clubs. The overall plan would eliminate arbitration and 
restrict free agency with a salary cap. O'Connor said Thursday, however, that 
the PRC is willing to accept modifications in the pay-for-performance system, 
allowing the union -- rather than a statistical table -- to determine how and 
how much of the 48% would be allotted to players in the zero-to-six category. 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that an agreement -- or definitive progress toward an agreement 
-- must be in place by Feb. 15 or spring training camps will not open, and he 
said that the owners have amassed a fund of $170 million as insurance against a 
work stoppage.

Former boxing champion Terry Marsh was charged with attempted murder Thursday 
in the shooting of his former manager, promoter Frank Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, who had been questioned by police for more than 32 hours before the 
charge was filed, also was charged with possession of ammunition without a 
firearms certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who managed Marsh, 31, to the International Boxing Federation junior 
welterweight crown in 1987 and has since become a successful fight promoter, 
was shot Nov. 30 outside a London theater where he was staging a boxing card. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a former schoolboy chess champion and known for his mild nature, was 
undefeated in 30 fights, but retired in 1987 after being diagnosed as an 
epileptic.

AUSSIE DESIGN STUDENTS PULL THE WOOL OFF THE WORLD'S EYES

It's long been the perception that Australian fashion lags decades behind the 
rest of the world, with Down Under practically synonymous with dowdy. But if 
the recent Australian Wool Corp. Young Designer Awards are any indication, 
Australia is becoming an important island in the mainstream of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
At the ninth annual event held in a nightclub here, the 14 finalists in the 
men's and women's categories from the seven Australian states (culled from 
about 600 entries) avoided the usual student excesses -- Star Trek space suits 
and copies of looks from European designer collections. "Anything printed with 
views of Sydney harbor or koala bears was out," joked one student. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there was a preference for simple lines with subtle details, a glaring 
contrast to the over-designed, costumey ensembles often seen at student shows 
in Los Angeles, New York and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A wide-legged jumpsuit in navy had a simple white yoke at the shoulder. For 
men, a street-tough look included a voluminous coat that latched at the side 
with a metal D-ring over short, cuffed trousers worn with high-top boots. 
</P>
<P>
One student took a humorous stab at a bridal gown with a tight, white, 
thigh-high number with an overskirt that resembled the cage-like structures 
women used to wear under hoop skirts. 
</P>
<P>
The winners epitomized the students' penchant for simple sophistication. 
Lindsay Wallace of Western Australia, women's wear winner, designed an 
off-white wool jersey body suit draped with a sculptured stole "inspired by 
ancient Greek goddesses." Men's wear winner Sandra Donlan of South Australia 
fashioned formal tails with a bias-pleated and tucked vest in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that the required fabric for entry into Australia's most 
prestigious student fashion design competition is wool. The nation's wool 
growers provide the world with 70% of the apparel wool traded internationally 
adding up to a $6-billion-a-year industry for the Aussies.

SNOOPY GETS ALL DOLLED UP FOR BIRTHDAY BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In print, Snoopy's wardrobe is fairly limited: red flannel pajamas, a snazzy 
Flying Ace costume, a simple yellow rain slicker for the occasional downpour. 
</P>
<P>
But next week, as Snoopy celebrates his 40th birthday, he and his sister Belle 
are going haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
They will be outfitted by top designers from all over the world when 300 plush 
Snoopy and Belle dolls show up in custom-made clothes from such high-fashion 
creators as Giorgio Armani, Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a part of a Snoopy retrospective exhibition opening at the Louvre in 
Paris on Jan. 23. On that date, a party will be thrown for the Peanuts gang. 
And Charles Schulz, their creator, is expected to receive a medal for arts and 
letters, presented by the French Ministry of Culture. Los Angeles designers on 
the long list of Snoopy couturiers include Bob Mackie, who's known for glitzy, 
sequined creations for such clients as Cher and Carol Burnett, and Rachel 
London, the Melrose Avenue posy maven whose flower-power styles show up on such 
stars as Madonna, Jody Watley and Lisa Bonet. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred forty-six designers in all have contributed to the show. It was 
created by Connie Boucher, chairman of San Francisco-based Determined 
Productions Inc., which has produced Snoopy paraphernalia for more than 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Louvre show will include samples of Schulz' original art and items from his 
personal collection of Peanuts paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
The show will move to Japan's Mitsukoshi department store in May and in October 
to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. There are plans for the 
exhibit, whose production costs are being underwritten by Determined 
Productions, United Features Syndicate and Charles Schulz Creative Associates, 
to travel to New York, London, Milan and Madrid in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
According to Boucher, the designers' outfits were donated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something the designers did for fun," she says of the contributors, 
who include just about every big name in the fashion world today: Chanel, 
Beene, Blass, Montana, Cacharel, Missoni, Fendi, Guess, Hermes, Porthault, 
Rykiel, McFadden, Miyake, Ungaro, to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
Not many fashion all-stars declined to participate. Asked to name those who 
refused, Boucher declined to get specific. But two famous American names are 
conspicuously missing from the list: Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
Says Boucher: "There's no specific reason with either of those. I don't know 
why they didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, as Snoopy might surmise, maybe they're allergic to morning.

ANDY WARHOL &amp; COMPANY -- RETHINKING THE ART OF THE SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High name-recognition value certainly accompanies the show of early graphic 
work by the late Andy Warhol, which opens Sunday at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. For an art that grew from advertising, it's only fitting. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Pop art of the 1960s remains among the most widely misunderstood 
artistic movements of the 20th Century. It certainly has enjoyed crowd-pleasing 
notoriety almost from the very start. But, maybe because of all that raucous 
public clamor, resistance to clear-eyed examination remains surprisingly 
strong. Pop easily bypassed slower traffic on the road to posterity, and 
annoyed the art world's mandarin gate-keepers no end. 
</P>
<P>
The clearest sign of the confusion is that the two most common readings of the 
art are completely contradictory to one another. With its soup cans, comic 
strips and sleek Hollywood glamour, Pop is claimed to be: a.) a buoyant 
celebration of the spectacular machinery of consumerism, advertising and all 
the new visual languages of mass culture; or b.) a withering critique of the 
vacant soul of consumerism, advertising and all the new visual languages of 
mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
Only a fool would deny that popular culture has something to do with Pop art. 
Only a fool could deny that art culture has something to do with it too. In 
fact, it's turning out that Pop's great triumph emerged from its purposeful 
inquiry into the gassy, suffocating rhetoric that characterized American 
painting by the end of the 1950s. Arriving at a moment of nerve-wracking 
vacancy in the precincts of culture, Pop art assumed the role of Abstract 
Expressionism's pointed nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
The great, sprawling retrospective of Andy Warhol's career mounted last year at 
New York's Museum of Modern Art offered one welcome occasion to rethink the Pop 
phenomenon. The mammoth show focused principally on Warhol's paintings of the 
1960s. Some people groused, complaining that even so large an exhibition drew 
an incomplete profile of its subject, but I thought the choice was just right. 
Warhol, still respected only grudgingly, needed to be emphatically represented 
at his peak. At the Modern, painting after painting from the 1960s made the 
brilliance of his work virtually inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
With its forceful emphasis, the show provided a perfect foil for still another 
shot of re-examination. The Grey Art Gallery at New York University assembled a 
compact survey of the dozen years Warhol worked as a prosperous commercial 
artist. Unexpectedly, this gathering of mostly 1950s magazine graphics, 
newspaper advertisements, menu illustrations, fabric motifs, record-album 
covers, book jackets, Christmas card designs and photographs of department 
store window-dressing treatments began to answer complex questions about where 
the great paintings of the 1960s, resplendently installed up the street at the 
Museum of Modern Art, had come from. "Success is a job in New York . . .: The 
Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" became the sleeper-hit of the Manhattan 
art season. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad the Warhol retrospective came nowhere near California on its 
international tour. "Success is a job in New York . . ." almost didn't make it, 
either. Thanks to some 11th-hour juggling, however, the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum was able to squeeze the show into its schedule (it will remain through 
March 18). 
</P>
<P>
Miss the exhibition only at your peril, for lots of interesting points of 
convergence between Warhol in the 1950s and his Pop efflorescence in the 1960s 
await amiable discovery. The funniest is in a 1952 photograph of the 
24-year-old artist, made with his art-director friend, Otto Fenn. By 
overpainting with black ink, Warhol's profile is made sleek and model-handsome, 
transforming the ethnic features of his Czech ancestry into an All-American 
look. This wittily altered photograph anticipates by a decade the famous 
"Before and After" painting based on a plastic surgery advertisement for a nose 
job. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to think about Warhol's Pop art in relation to his commercial 
work of the previous decade is surely welcome. But try examining his commercial 
art while keeping the contemporaneous backdrop of Abstract Expressionism firmly 
in mind. Therein lies the key to understanding Pop. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that much Pop art of the early 1960s can be productively thought 
of as Abstract Expressionist ideas represented by commercial, graphic images. A 
gritty style of newspaper advertising is employed to that end, for example, in 
Roy Lichtenstein's 1962 paintings in the collection of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein's "Meat" shows a cut of raw beef. "Strong Hand (The Grip)" shows 
muscle-building equipment. "Desk Calendar" shows a daily notebook with 
appointments logged. Together, these "raw, muscular, autobiographical" 
paintings compose an imagistic anthology of value-laden Abstract Expressionist 
language, concocted to describe the earlier paintings of Jackson Pollock, Franz 
Kline, Willem de Kooning and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Edward Ruscha. Also at MOCA is his 1962 "Annie," whose title is 
written in fluid maple syrup -- a drip-painting if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
As for Warhol, the critic Dave Hickey began a similar decoding in last summer's 
number of the quarterly magazine Parkett. Most famously, the nearly 
interchangeable splash-and-dribble of paint in late Abstract Expressionism was 
colloquially known as "soup" -- so commercial-artist Andy turned to Campbell's. 
</P>
<P>
The existential pain of the '50s became the spur for all manner of Andy's 
tabloid images of personal disaster -- "129 Die!" -- while his pictures of 
electric chairs pointedly included signs invoking Beckett's Silence. Pollock's 
romantic legend had been heroically capped when the automobile he was driving 
smashed into a tree, so Warhol painted car crashes. Marilyn, Jackie and Liz 
took turns playing the role of De Kooning's powerful women, while the energetic 
directive for the artist to get "inside" the painting, bodily, is played out as 
footstep-pictures of dance diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get the hang of it, you can find Ab-Ex cliches all over the Pop map. 
Off the top of my head, I'd add to Hickey's list Warhol's enormous paintings of 
flowers, taken from a garden photograph in a seed catalogue: With the old, 
abstract expanse of color across the canvas now replaced by grass and blossoms, 
they literally became the "field paintings" described in painterly rhetoric of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
The show coming to Newport Beach is fascinating because it puts the advertising 
processes of commercial art in the foreground, and they are at the core of 
Warhol's Pop strategy. His job, as a commercial artist, had been to find 
concise, compelling images with which to sell purely abstract concepts, such as 
"sophistication," "uniqueness" or "casual elegance." His new job, as a Pop 
artist, was to do the same for Abstract Expressionist concepts, such as "the 
tragic," "the sublime" or "the transcendent." 
</P>
<P>
Warhol's Pop sold the image of art -- or, more precisely, sold the reigning 
American image of art in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a generation after Abstract Expressionism's phenomenal rise to 
international prominence, it's hard to imagine just how inspiriting the 
situation must have been: For the first time, ever, an American artist could be 
of international consequence. 
</P>
<P>
At least, some could. In his memoirs, the art dealer John Bernard Myers tells 
of painter Helen Frankenthaler's calculating decision in 1958 suddenly to leave 
his gallery: Her new husband, the influential artist Robert Motherwell, did not 
approve of his wife being represented by a homosexual. And in the Grey Art 
Gallery catalogue, Trevor Fairbrother relates an incident in 1959 in which, for 
similar reasons, Warhol's paintings were rejected for a show at the prestigious 
Tanager Gallery: The macho, male-dominated milieu of the New York School, now 
legendary, couldn't exactly accommodate an effeminate gay fop like Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
The dissonance in "high art" subject matter shown as "low art" commercial 
imagery describes, in aesthetic terms, the conflict between Abstract 
Expressionism's grand, universalist rhetoric of existential freedom and the 
vulgar reality of its exclusionary social milieu. "Success is a job in New York 
. . ." reveals how Pop's most exalted subject is its eloquent drama of personal 
freedom.

<P>
DANCE: CHOREOGRAPHER NORMAN WALKER'S PROJECT IS THE FIRST U.S.-CHINA CULTURAL 
EXCHANGE SINCE THE BRUTAL CRACKDOWN ON PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seated in the front row of the Capital Theater, beneath the giant red star of 
communism that dominates the Stalinist-era auditorium in downtown Beijing, 
Norman Walker clearly was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so much that Walker, an internationally known choreographer from New 
York City, was about to view the fruits of his month's labor with 22 of the 
finest ballet dancers in the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was it the simple fact that Walker's project here represents the first 
cultural exchange between America and China since last June's brutal crackdown 
on the pro-democracy demonstrators of nearby Tian An Men Square, an event that 
provoked U.S. government sanctions against China and isolated its hard-line 
leadership from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
No, Walker was far more worried about how he'd react to one of the stranger 
Chinese customs. In China, it seems, no one applauds. 
</P>
<P>
"It affects me terribly," the Adelphi University, N.Y., dance professor said 
just before the purple curtain went up on Wednesday night's preview 
performance. "I sit in the audience, and I die. But that's just the way 
audiences are in China." 
</P>
<P>
And that's just one of the lessons that Norman Walker learned since he agreed 
to be the guinea pig of the international cultural world, the first Western 
expert to participate directly here since horrified television audiences the 
world over watched China's army kill hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the 
demonstrators in the streets of Beijing seven months ago and then saw China 
slide into cultural isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, though, none of those lessons has been political for Walker, who 
has worked with other dance companies in more than a half-dozen countries 
during the last 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about classical ballet is it's immune to any kind of political 
influences," Walker said. "Classical ballet has existed under so many different 
kinds of governments -- under Czarist Russia, Marxist Russia, Communist China, 
capitalist America and royal Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing people will not be able to do is look at my work here and turn 
it into some kind of manifesto. I'm not making a political statement with my 
piece at all." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Walker sees his four weeks of intensive work with the Central Ballet of 
China, which officially opened a three-night performance of his new ballet, "In 
the Mountain Forest" on Thursday, as far more significant in artistic terms. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet's music is a piano concerto written in 1980 by Chinese composer Liu 
Dunnan. The choreography, Walker said, is not merely a melding of classical and 
contemporary ballet. It is a blend of Western and Chinese dance, as well -- a 
mixture that Walker considers more of a "recombination" than a ground-breaking 
feat. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who has been in Adelphi's performing arts department in Garden City, 
Long Island, for nearly two decades, theorizes that the pioneers of modern 
American dance adopted many styles from traditional Chinese folk dance during 
extended forays to the Far East in the mid-1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Walker noted that Martha Graham, the 95-year-old institution who 
is considered the greatest choreographer of modern American dance, "has said on 
many occasions that she stole liberally from China and the East" while 
developing the basic techniques of modern dance in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he believes that, in the last month, he actually has been putting 
back into China what was borrowed more than a half-century ago, Walker smiled 
and said, "No, that's too big, too enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"In some sense, though, I'm re-acquainting them with what we learned from them. 
The thing that they (Chinese ballet masters) haven't been able to accomplish 
yet is they haven't been able to meld these two styles together themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Wu Jingshu agreed. Wu, or Madame Wu as she is known here, is one of China's 
first ballerinas, a graduate of the first class of dancers to attend the 
Beijing Dancing School established by Soviet experts in 1954. Now, she is 
director of the cultural exchange program of the Central Ballet of China, which 
also was established by Russian advisers in 1959, five years after the dance 
school opened. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was, our Soviet ballet masters were much too rigid in their 
teaching," Wu said. "And, at that time, there was only one window opening on 
the world for us." 
</P>
<P>
But as the revolution that had brought communism to China in 1949 deepened, the 
windows of creativity closed altogether. When Communist Party Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung began his Cultural Revolution in 1966, Chinese ballet was hardly 
immune. The dance company was allowed to perform only two compositions, one of 
them the heavily propagandizing "Red Detachment of Women." And star performers 
such as Wu were sent to the countryside for "cultural re-education." 
</P>
<P>
"I was made to spend three years working in the orchards and the fields," Wu 
recalled. "I never ate so much fruit in my life. And when I returned to the 
ballet company, my bones were so damaged, I could only perform character 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
When the Cultural Revolution ended, though, the ballet company's artistic 
windows gradually reopened, Wu said -- first to Western Europe in the early 
1980s, and finally to America, where two patrons had actively begun to coax the 
ballet troupe out from behind its nation's ideological curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese-born American dance aficionado Mary Kantor and her husband, Sidney, 
first saw the Beijing ballet company perform in 1981 and spent the next five 
years trying to persuade Chinese authorities to allow it to tour America. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't understand why I wanted to bring them out," Mary Kantor said of 
the Chinese leadership. "I said, 'Because it's a beautiful company.' And they 
said, 'We don't want you to lose money. Who's going to pay for tickets to see 
Chinese on Western ballet shoes?' " 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the internationally acclaimed Peking Opera, ballet has long been viewed 
as a purely Western art form, and Chinese authorities were deeply suspicious of 
Kantor's motives at first. 
</P>
<P>
But she refused to give up, and, finally, in the spring of 1986, with the 
Kantors' sponsorship, the Central Ballet of China gave 47 performances in 62 
days in 11 cities throughout America, among them a three-day, sell-out show in 
Pasadena that Wu said was the troupe's most memorable. 
</P>
<P>
For most members of the company, the U.S. tour was a watershed. For some, it 
was a temptation as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Some dancers wanted to learn more of these things in the West -- especially 
more jazz and modern dance," Wu said. "Some thought also it would be nice if 
they could dance outside (China) all the time. But, for most, they knew that in 
China they are prima ballerinas who make their parents proud. And they live 
well here. Their basic salary is only 170 yuan a month (about $35), but their 
rents are just a few yuan a month and all of the girls have VCRs in their 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of the dancers were more than merely tempted to leave after the 
bloody turmoil of last June. Reliable sources said that at least five of the 
company's top dancers, including two of its best ballerinas, were outside China 
when the crackdown took place around Tian An Men Square, and none of them has 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
For Mary Kantor, who is also sponsoring Norman Walker's private mission here, 
politics has no place in dance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no race nor politics in the eyes of art," the New York City patron 
declared in a Jan. 8 speech announcing Walker's visit. "The function of art in 
any form today, and dance is no exception, is to create a bridge between 
cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, China's hard-line leadership, which has condemned America for its 
sanctions countless times since the Tian An Men killings, has been supportive 
of Walker's mission. The Communist Party's propaganda chief, Li Ruihan, said 
last week that China's doors must remain open to Western ideas, provided they 
are integrated into "Chinese characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
Walker bristled at the suggestion that he is allowing himself to be used 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
"No, because I'm helping the people," he said. "I'm not helping the government. 
All I'm trying to do is teach people who do not want to be closed off, who do 
not want to be isolated from the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the many years that he worked on contract with Ballet Philippines, 
whose principal patron was Imelda Marcos, the wife of the late dictator 
Ferdinand E. Marcos, Walker added, "I was not a fan of the Marcoses in any way, 
shape or form, but does that mean that I'm going to turn my back on the 
Filipino people? 
</P>
<P>
"Nor am I not going to turn my back on these people, these dancers, simply 
because of things that happened in the country. Quite frankly, in the '40s and 
'50s, should the rest of the world have turned its back on America because of 
the way we were treating the blacks? 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm not being naive. You'd have to live in a cave if you were afraid of 
being used. A lot of people are going to interpret what I'm doing one way or 
another. And I understand the significance of the situation . . . But it is 
politically significant only because of the timing, not because of content or 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Walker has, however, made some observations about the creative situation during 
his month here that reflect an understanding of the political realities. 
</P>
<P>
He had high praise for several of the Chinese dancers performing his 21-minute 
piece, which depicts adolescence, love and marriage. But, when asked whether 
the ballet company as a whole will ever gain international acclaim as a 
world-class dance troupe, he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't happen until they can fire somebody," said Walker. "Under the system 
here, the common-rice-bowl theory, they have a job no matter what, no matter 
how they perform."

A CRITIC TAKES OFF TO BECOME A 'REAL' WRITER

Journalists are sometimes asked: "Do you ever do any real writing?" The 
question makes us bristle -- what we do feels real enough to us -- but we 
understand its subtext, and perhaps even agree with it. Journalists write 
columns. Real writers write books. 
</P>
<P>
So I am taking a year off from The Times to tackle one. It will be a biography 
of American playwright William Inge. Inge had four hit plays in a row in the 
1950s, including "Picnic" and "Bus Stop," and was in such despair by 1973 that 
he killed himself. There ought to be a story in that. 
</P>
<P>
To write it, I am going back to Inge's Midwest. That means no Los Angeles 
theater for a year. Separation anxiety is immediately felt: What's a journalist 
without his beat. Especially when the beat is to be covered by a critic as 
disturbingly qualified as Sylvie Drake. 
</P>
<P>
But the die is cast: the boxes have been shipped, the office is bare. All 
that's left are a few yellow Post-It notes on the bulletin board -- stuff to 
put in the column one day. This would seem to be the day:

* "Piano." This refers to August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson," which I am not 
going to get to see at the Doolittle Theatre. This is a big frustration, for it 
struck, a year ago at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, as Wilson's richest and 
funniest play yet. I guess I'll just have to read about it. (See review on F1.) 
</P>
<P>
* "Branagh." Another frustration is having to miss Kenneth Branagh's 
Renaissance Theatre Company stagings of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "King 
Lear" at the Mark Taper Forum. Again -- certain readers seem to refuse to take 
the point -- the argument isn't that American actors can't perform Shakespeare. 
It's that Los Angeles needs to see an acting company with an agreed-upon 
approach to Shakespeare and the ability to bring his language alive in the 
theater. Branagh's British actors are there to remind us that we can have our 
own classical repertory company at the Music Center if we really want it. 
</P>
<P>
* "Ahmanson." Hooray; there is serious talk about reconfiguring the Ahmanson 
Theatre for spoken drama. Some say that this can be done without losing its 
capacity for handling big-budget musicals when they come along. Maybe so, but 
there aren't many examples of theaters that can successfully serve two masters. 
The simplest and bravest solution (not necessarily the cheapest one) would be 
to scale down the house to seat 1,200 people, all within the immediate range of 
the actor's unassisted voice. Chamber music needs a certain ambience. So does 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
* "AIDS." I was remiss in not mentioning the Taper's recent "Because We Care" 
benefit, featuring members of "The Phantom of the Opera" cast, excluding 
Michael Crawford. Besides raising $20,000 and dozens of baskets of food for two 
local AIDS projects (Hollywood Helps and Necessities of Life), the evening 
offered the quintessential rendition of Leonard Bernstein's "Glitter and Be 
Gay," transformed into a battle between two air-head sopranos, neither of whom 
knew that the other had been invited. Bravo, Dale Kristien, Leigh Munro and 
director David Galligan. 
</P>
<P>
* "Tru." A recent disparaging remark about "clone theater" in this space wasn't 
meant to apply to Robert Morse's uncanny evocation of Truman Capote at 
Broadway's Booth Theatre. This wasn't a rip-off of Capote, but a reminder that 
there was a vulnerable person beneath his fuss and feathers -- that it took a 
considerable amount of courage to be Truman Capote. Morse now owns Capote, the 
way Hal Holbrook owns Mark Twain. It's the kind of annuity every good actor 
deserves, and it won't keep Morse from playing other roles. Bravo again. 
</P>
<P>
* "Year-End." For all the think-pieces written on the 1980s, nobody wrote one 
on the words, phrases and even sounds that first surfaced during that decade. 
It was about '83, for example, that I noticed that theater audiences, 
especially younger ones, weren't merely applauding: they were now squealing, 
like the proverbial stuck pig. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s also introduced Wo! as a term of surprised admiration. News analysts 
started using the word perception to mean impression. People started wearing 
power ties and going to power lunches and even power breakfasts. And on leaving 
work at the end of the day, colleagues would say, "Have a good one." 
</P>
<P>
It was the decade when "get off my back" became "get off my case" -- or even 
"get out of my face." Zero in football scores became zip. Nerds became 
wanna-bes. What did it all mean? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know. I'm outta here. Have a good one.

We all have mental pictures of natural events large and small: cyclones, phases 
of the moon, lightning, the simple act of dropping a rock into a pond. In his 
recent work, John Divola meditates on the distance between these frozen, 
simplified images and the nuanced complexity of real-life events. 
</P>
<P>
He constructs engagingly raffish mock-ups of natural scenes with wildly painted 
papier-mache and photographs them in black-and-white with a large-format 
Polaroid camera. 
</P>
<P>
Resulting images reduce grandiose acts of God into simple plays of form and 
light, and amplify small corners of nature into exuberant fanfares. In the 
sequence of four photographs that make up "Cyclone on the Beach," a cone shape 
gradually darkens, shadows deepen and "stars" emerge on the gray "sky" 
backdrop. In "Splash," a papier-mache rock churns up a frankly fake wake of 
choppy brush strokes on a painted body of water. 
</P>
<P>
Most works have a strong, elemental visual appeal especially "Lightning," with 
its trio of whisper-thin, vertical white lines cutting through a drippy 
gray-black ground. As Divola writes, his work is about "accident, gesture, 
process and a melancholy faith." (Jan Kesner Gallery, 164 N. La Brea Ave., to 
Feb. 17.) CATHY CURTIS

David Bierk's new paintings, collectively titled "In the Absence of Paradise," 
are medleys of copies from famous artists of the past. The styles are 
reproduced with superficial accuracy, but each work is either much larger or 
much smaller than the original. 
</P>
<P>
Bierk is big on Fantin La Tour's flowers, Gauguin's Polynesian scenes and 
Vermeer's unforgettable women. There is something unpleasantly manipulative 
about this work, with its couplings of brand name artists and popular images, 
its fake sentimentality and its stentorian appeal to the viewer to recognize 
the underlying meanings of art. 
</P>
<P>
Bierk combines Vermeer's woman with a pearl earring, a painted sunset sky and 
landscape photographs into a fiction he calls "Home/Wife to Vermeer." He 
juxtaposes a Bwami mask with a portrait of Freud and a Degas painting of a 
father and daughter as if to say, "See, this is really deep, stuff on many 
cultural levels." And he ostentatiously genuflects before the cold perfection 
of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs and tragically brief life with the painted 
image of a curly haired Greek god in "In Remembrance of Icarus, to Robert 
Mapplethorpe, Manet, Claude Lorrain and the Planet Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The artist pursues a somewhat more grounded, less hype-conscious theme in 
another group of works in which rather crude paintings of landscape amplify on 
photographs of quintessentially "artistic" natural views: a pond at twilight, a 
summer storm. Scenes like these, typically chosen for bravura painterly 
effects, now seem more persuasive as captured by the mechanical eye of the 
camera -- which suggests that painting no longer has the vision or the 
vocabulary to summon up the old magic. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., 
to Feb. 3.) CATHY CURTIS

'FREE SPIRIT' IS OUT, 'ELVIS' IS IN AT ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC has canceled the first-year series "Free Spirit" and will replace it next 
month with "Elvis," a series based on the early life of the rock 'n' roll king. 
His widow, Priscilla Presley, is co-executive producer of the show. 
</P>
<P>
With Michael St. Gerard in the title role, "Elvis" will premiere Feb. 6 at 9:30 
p.m., after "Roseanne," then will move into its regular slot of 8:30 p.m. 
Sundays on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Set in Memphis during the 1950s, "Elvis" is described by ABC as a "music-filled 
drama (that is) based on true incidents in Elvis' life." Millie Perkins will 
portray Presley's mother, and Jordan Williams plays Sam Phillips, owner of Sun 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
"Free Spirit," a sitcom about a housekeeper who is a witch, has had ratings 
problems since it debuted in September. It ranks 85th among the 91 prime-time 
series that have been broadcast on the three major networks this season.

STUDY ATTACKS REMOVAL POLICY FOR ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Widespread removal of asbestos from U.S. schools and buildings poses greater 
health risks than just leaving the material in place, according to a 
comprehensive study attacking the nation's asbestos-removal policy and 
published in the journal Science today. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which reviewed data on asbestos-related cancers and the level of 
asbestos in hundreds of public schools and buildings, concluded that low-level 
exposure to airborne concentrations of chrysotile asbestos, the type that 
exists in most structures across the country, poses relatively few health risks 
compared to other types of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the study concludes, the determination by many federal and state 
health officials to remove asbestos only creates a risk to workers hired to 
remove the substance and does not substantially lower the risk to the 
building's occupants. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are almost certain to stir the national debate on the health risks 
posed by asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that to make claims that (asbestos) is innocuous is wrong," said Dr. 
William Nicholson, professor of community medicine at Mt. Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York. "All public policy must be based on the probability that 
there is risk." 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency requires all schools and buildings to be 
inspected for "friable," or deteriorating, asbestos and calls for removal or 
repair in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the asbestos panic in the United States must be curtailed, especially 
because unwarranted, poorly controlled asbestos abatement results in 
unnecessary risks to young removal workers who may develop asbestos-related 
cancers in later decades," the team of medical researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In the study of more than 400 air samples from schools and buildings, the 
researchers found no difference between airborne asbestos levels inside or 
outside the structures. The researchers said that removal of "previously 
undamaged or encapsulated asbestos can lead to an increase in airborne 
concentrations of fibers in buildings . . . and can result in problems with 
safe removal and disposal." 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned is that you will breath the same amount indoors or outdoors," 
said researcher Morton Corn, director of the division of Environmental Health 
Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "There really isn't an 
occupant problem in schools and buildings. The best way to deal with asbestos 
is to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA policy does not take into account the type of asbestos present in 
structures. But the new study suggests that the hazards are directly related to 
the type and size of the asbestos fibers released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. Bernard Gee, professor of Internal Medicine at the Yale University 
School of Medicine and one of the authors of the study, said that their 
research indicates that most asbestos-related lung diseases, including cancer, 
appear linked to a type of asbestos called amphibole, a needle-like fiber. 
However, chrysotile, the type of asbestos with curly fibers and the kind 
predominantly found in U.S. and Canadian schools, appears to have more 
difficulty penetrating the lungs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is saying you mustn't be careful, but there is no reason for the 
generalized, widespread removal of all asbestos," Gee said. "What is being done 
in renovating a lot of public buildings makes no sense from a medical, 
biological or environmental standpoint. In our judgment, it's a monumental 
waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Elkins, director of the EPA's Office of Toxic Substances, 
disagreed. "We just don't have the information to give a clean bill of health 
to any of these fibers," he said. "We agree people should not panic if asbestos 
is found, but to write it off as an insignificant risk is misleading, because 
the risks are there." 
</P>
<P>
Gee said that rather than automatically removing or covering crumbling 
asbestos, tests should be conducted to determine the type of asbestos and the 
amount entering the air. The study contends that the EPA's asbestos removal 
policy has "resulted in the explosive growth of asbestos identification and 
removal companies." The study's authors estimate the cost of removing the 
substance from most of the nation's buildings at $100 billion to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Other asbestos researchers called the EPA's removal policy prudent and 
suggested that the study could be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to dismiss the health risk because the asbestos may be chrysotile would 
be wrong," Mt. Sinai's Nicholson said. "The EPA policy is based on the idea 
that if you have asbestos, you want to do everything you can to prevent 
exposure, and I think that's an appropriate policy." 
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping effort aimed at heading off a leading cause of lung cancer, the 
EPA last year ordered a nearly total ban on the use of asbestos. Under the ban, 
the manufacture or importation of 94% of asbestos-containing products, 
including roof shingles, automobile brakes and concrete pipes, is to be 
outlawed in the United States by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, the generic name for a host of naturally occurring fibrous minerals, 
tends to break down into a dust of tiny fibers that can be easily inhaled. The 
substance's remarkable durability permits asbestos fibers to remain in the body 
for years, contributing to the long delays between exposure and the emergence 
of asbestos-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered the "miracle mineral" for its strength and durability, asbestos 
has since gained infamy as a deadly invisible poison responsible for thousands 
of deaths each year. 
</P>
<P>
"What this study tells us is that as a national policy, we've overreacted," 
Corn said. "If there is a need to remove failed asbestos products, health 
should not always be invoked as the reason."

MCMARTIN VERDICT: NOT GUILTY; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE JURY'S FINDINGS CLOSE THE LONGEST AND COSTLIEST CRIMINAL TRIAL IN 
HISTORY. NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON RETRYING RAY BUCKEY ON 13 UNDECIDED 
COUNTS. 
</P>

Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty 
Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in 
Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest 
criminal trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- 
acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine 
weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two 
years. The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a 
mistrial was declared on those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own 
recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will 
retry him on the 13 undecided counts. But his 63-year-old mother and 
co-defendant reacted with anger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything," she said outside the 
court. "My concern was for my son and what they've done to him . . . because my 
son would never harm a child." 
</P>
<P>
Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been 
molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the Buckeys were culpable. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not convinced that he (Ray Buckey) is innocent," said juror Sally 
Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. "But it was not proven to me that he did 
it. Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom. The Buckeys, who 
spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system, had sat 
silently, staring straight ahead, as the jury filed into the room shortly 
before 10:30 a.m. and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"All the verdicts are the same," said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William 
Pounders, handing them to his court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then, reading from the 
verdict form, delivered in a single, almost anti-climactic sentence the 
historic trial's close: 
</P>
<P>
"We the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs. At first, the 
defendants remained stoic, then their eyes began to rim with tears. Ray 
Buckey's lower lip quivered. His mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. 
They said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Peggy McMartin Buckey insisted she was not bitter. "I knew God would 
set my son and me free because we have done nothing," she said as she was 
driven away. Her optimism was not matched by her son, however, who she said had 
"had fear, definitely," about what the jury would decide. 
</P>
<P>
"I held his hand," Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced, "and 
I told him: 'I told you, Ray,' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history, a case that 
stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had 
been sodomized at his school by a "Mr. Ray." The case ultimately cost taxpayers 
more than $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a 
national focal point for the issue of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts: "I found it difficult 
to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place. I thought 
that based on the evidence that was presented, the jury could do almost 
anything and still find rational support for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to test the credibility of children, and when you go 
beyond that, the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration. It 
was very difficult to find corroboration in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the case was worth its cost in money, lives and stress, Pounders said 
he thinks society benefited from the case. 
</P>
<P>
"People will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense 
taking place at preschool and at schools," Pounders said. "People are no longer 
dropping their children off and walking away blindly. They look back. They 
check things out more." 
</P>
<P>
In the crowded courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims lashed out at 
the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not 
been well served by the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
"The system doesn't allow us to protect kids," said the father of two alleged 
victims. "I have no doubt these children were abused. 
</P>
<P>
Said a tearful mother: "I guess maybe it's OK to (molest) kids! I can't believe 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that we are telling the truth," said a 15-year-old boy who had 
testified. "No matter what the jury says, whatever anybody says, this is the 
truth. We were molested." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the children said that, when the clerk read "not guilty" on the 
verdict form, "my stomach just hollowed out. I was beyond tears. Those words 
will stick with me probably the rest of my life. I'll never forget those two 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods. In particular, they cited the 
prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of 
the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center. They also criticized 
the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, 
to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and 
soliciting information. 
</P>
<P>
"The children," said juror John Breese, 51, a biomedical technician, "were 
never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them. That was 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Said jury foreman Luis Chang, an electrical engineer: "The key evidence that 
swayed me was the interview tapes. They were too biased, too leading. That's 
the main crux of it." 
</P>
<P>
All said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds, not only 
because the judge had so instructed, but also because the disjointed testimony 
had left them confused. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first 
sat in the jury box the first day of this trial," said Brenda Williams, 38, a 
Pacific Bell service representative. "I felt I had missed out on something, 
maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of 
my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that 
would make it all come together." 
</P>
<P>
Said juror Mark Bassett, 33, a computer specialist: "We just didn't really know 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case, said a decision has not 
been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial. These 
counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey, and a conspiracy 
count that accused both him and his mother. The conspiracy count against Peggy 
McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We ultimately must respect the jury's decision," Rubin said, "even though I 
personally disagree with it. 
</P>
<P>
"The system worked well for them," she said in reference to the Buckeys. "They 
were lucky. I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray 
Buckey molesting children." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system 
for the length of the trial, and said he backs two state court-reform 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much time and too much money has gone into this case. This is insane. The 
very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational 
result is preposterous. The McMartin case is the very worst example that we 
have, period. But it does not stand alone." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis were beaming after the verdict 
announcement. "I feel great," Gits said, indicating he had found hope that the 
decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it 
was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquittal, Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that 
had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be 
released after five years in jail. Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller 
bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case -- which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral 
copulation, and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography 
sessions, "naked games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, 
animal mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice -- began in 
the fall of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her 
son had been sodomized by "Mr. Ray," and subsequent physical examinations 
indicated he had been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the 
investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the 
Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of 
"uncharged suspects," and eight other South Bay nursery schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of 
McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept 
through the affluent beach town. Many parents took their youngsters to 
Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and 
treatment center, for evaluation; the majority were told that their children 
had been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann 
Buckey, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, 
and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson. A county grand 
jury had indicted them on 115 counts; that indictment was superseded in May by 
a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children. 
</P>
<P>
The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning. Then-Dist. 
Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught 
wind of the investigation, were pressing for action. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted 
untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews 
filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove 
embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for 
claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had 
been molested. 
</P>
<P>
Hysteria grew. Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide 
conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted 
"Ray Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an 
adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked 
by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys 
and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb, and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that 
lasted in one instance for 16 days. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a 
booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters. They 
munched cookies, swigged root beer, and sometimes sobbed as they told of their 
experiences at McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy 
voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet 
by her teachers five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, 
telling each, "The court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are 
guilty." The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled 
child witnesses came forward to testify. One child was allowed to testify by 
closed-circuit television, under a new state law passed especially for the 
McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
But a week later, in January, 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, who 
had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of the 
seven defendants, citing "incredibly weak evidence" and deciding to proceed 
only against Ray Buckey and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
The trial itself began with jury selection in April, 1987. Testimony began in 
July. The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided 
not to allow their children to testify. Eventually nine of 11 named victims 
took the witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, but for minor 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they 
described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of 
the Buckeys. Their testimony was often raw and unsettling. The children's 
allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained 
their innocence. And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified 
that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused 
sexually, but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like 
efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or 
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school, but that 
the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had 
happened to them. It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that 
the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting 
the judge to comment that it had "poisoned" everyone it had touched. Day after 
day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre: 
</P>
<P>
* Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted 
colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts 
as, "This awful court. These awful people. These awful lies." 
</P>
<P>
* Therapist Kee MacFarlane, who conducted many of the interviews in which 
children first disclosed that they had been molested, came under fire when it 
was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but 
also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
* Former prosecutor Glenn Stevens became a key defense witness after leaking 
information that he believed that the defendants were innocent, and signed a 
movie contract to tell his revised version of events. 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-year-old boy, testifying at the preliminary hearing, identified everyone 
from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his 
molesters, and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery 
where they dug up corpses with shovels and pick-axes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEY FIGURES IN THE McMARTIN TRIAL 
</P>
<P>
THE JUDGE: 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM R. POUNDERS, 50 -- Superior Court judge since 1985. A former state 
prosecutor who also did appellate work, he was assigned to the case after the 
litigants rejected three other judges as prejudiced. An intellectual who often 
uses expressions derived from his Air Force experience building nuclear 
missiles, Pounders' strengths are meticulous organization and an extensive 
knowledge of the law, which he augments with a 3-by-5 index card file system, 
as well as a new computer. A graduate of Loyola Law School, he is widely 
respected as a fair and thorough judge. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENDANTS: 
</P>
<P>
RAY BUCKEY, 31 -- Key defendant in the McMartin case, Buckey is the grandson of 
nursery school founder Virginia McMartin and son of co-defendant Peggy McMartin 
Buckey. A quiet man who is a college dropout and has admitted having problems 
with drugs and alcohol, Buckey worked briefly at a San Diego child care center 
before joining his family's enterprise in Manhattan Beach. He was charged on 52 
counts of child molestation involving 11 children and one count of conspiracy 
shared with his mother. He denied all allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
PEGGY MCMARTIN BUCKEY, 63 -- Co-defendant in the McMartin case, she both 
directed the Virginia McMartin Pre-School and taught there. She also hired her 
son as a teacher. A talkative, religious woman who drew pictures throughout the 
tedious proceedings and crocheted during breaks, she was charged on 12 counts 
of molestation involving four children and one count of conspiracy. She has 
maintained that neither she nor any member of her staff engaged in improper 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROSECUTORS: 
</P>
<P>
LAEL R. RUBIN, 47 -- Co-prosecutor. A former high school English teacher, Rubin 
was a latecomer to the legal profession, graduating from the University of West 
Los Angeles School of Law in 1978. She quickly distinguished herself after 
joining the district attorney's office, successfully prosecuting "Black Cathy" 
Wilson for child pornography, Harry Sassounian for the assassination of the 
Turkish consul general in Los Angeles, and his brother, Harout Sassounian, for 
firebombing the Turkish consul general's house. She is the only original 
prosecutor remaining on the McMartin case. 
</P>
<P>
ROGER J. GUNSON, 50 -- Co-prosecutor. A 20-year veteran of the district 
attorney's office and a graduate of UCLA Law School, the soft-spoken, 
unassuming Gunson most recently served as head deputy in the Sex Crimes and 
Child Abuse Division. He successfully prosecuted film director Roman Polanski 
for unlawful sex with a minor, and Susan Brophy, wife of former state 
assemblyman Bill Brophy, for vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS: 
</P>
<P>
DANIEL G. DAVIS, 43 -- Defense attorney representing Ray Buckey. A graduate of 
the University of Texas law school, Davis was a civil attorney with the firm of 
Lillick McHose &amp; Charles for two years before turning to criminal law. 
Initially hired by the Buckey family, he was appointed to finish the case after 
their money ran out. He owns the now-defunct nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
DEAN R. GITS, 45 -- Defense attorney representing Peggy McMartin Buckey. A 
gentlemanly, cum laude graduate of the William Mitchell College of Law in St. 
Paul, Gits describes himself as "a simple country lawyer from Minnesota." Known 
for his painstakingly thorough work, he was a deputy public defender for nearly 
nine years before going into private practice with the firm of Overland, Berke, 
Wesley, Gits, Randolph &amp; Levanas. He has more than 15 years of criminal 
trial experience. He was court-appointed to the McMartin case at its beginning.

MOSCOW CALLS RESERVES TO HELP HALT CIVIL STRIFE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE DEFENSE MINISTER CALLS THE SITUATION IN ARMENIA AND 
AZERBAIJAN 'A MAJOR DISASTER.'

<P>
The Soviet government, struggling to re-establish its authority in the southern 
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, on Thursday put its armed forces there on 
a wartime footing and mobilized reservists as the fighting between Armenian and 
Azerbaijani militias grew. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov, the defense minister, described the situation in the area 
as "a major disaster" and said more troops are needed to enforce the state of 
emergency declared there Monday by the Soviet leadership in an attempt to 
restore order. And President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his first public comments 
on the crisis, defended the government's decision to send combat troops to 
quell the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the deployment of thousands of additional troops over the past two days 
and orders that they should open fire if attacked, "over the past 24 hours, the 
situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia has worsened," the official Tass news 
agency reported late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting was reported in districts around the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, along parts of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border and just 20 
miles south of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, where Azerbaijani militia units 
were said to have opened fire on two villages, killing a total of six people. 
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of the Azerbaijani Popular Front are ignoring appeals by the 
leadership of the republic and of the nation to stop illegal actions and to 
find a way out of the conflict," the Tass report said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Armenia, the seizure of arms and military equipment continues. Groups of 
armed militants are being formed in both republics. Extremists from the two 
conflicting sides seize civilian and military hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The two militias, which have raided police stations and ordnance depots, are 
now armed not only with rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers but also 
armored vehicles, helicopters and short-range missiles in what Interior 
Minister Vadim V. Bakatin flatly called a "civil war." 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry put the death toll at 66 after seven days of violence, 
but this figure is believed to be mostly those killed in anti-Armenian rioting 
in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital. The actual number, which includes several 
soldiers in the peacekeeping force, is thought to be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 220 people have been wounded, again mostly in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
So widespread were the clashes, some of them quite large, that the Soviet 
government Thursday no longer was facing only civil unrest but also a 
significant challenge to its authority. 
</P>
<P>
Besides remarking on the use of force, Gorbachev, speaking to a Kremlin meeting 
Thursday, offered a justification for the government's decision Monday to 
declare a state of emergency in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems, which have been accumulating for tens -- no, for hundreds -- of 
years, have erupted and acquired the character that we are now confronted 
with," he said. "We are now busy trying to halt this process, to prevent it 
from going deeper and becoming more acute. We have resorted to the use of force 
against criminals, against this vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
The enmity between Armenians and Azerbaijanis is rooted deeply in history and 
in sharp cultural and religious differences between them. One of the world's 
oldest civilizations, the Armenians are largely Christian and feel themselves 
an endangered nation after repeated massacres of their people. The 
Azerbaijanis, a Turkic-speaking nation, most of whom are Shiite Muslims, feel 
that they too have endured many wrongs that must be righted. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of contention in recent years has been Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely 
Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan, which both sides claim on historical 
grounds. Armenia has sought to annex it, Azerbaijan has refused, and the region 
has become the emblem of their rival nationalisms. 
</P>
<P>
Zaur Rustam-Zade, an Azerbaijani spokesman in Moscow, blamed "Armenian 
extremists" for the current crisis. He said they had terrorized Azerbaijani 
villagers for two years and thus had contributed to the outflow of Azerbaijani 
refugees from Armenia and, ultimately, to the flare-up of violence this week. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia's attempts in recent months to annex Nagorno-Karabakh have heightened 
the tensions, Rustam-Zade said, and led to what he called war. 
</P>
<P>
The scale of the fighting on Thursday ranged from clashes involving as many as 
3,000 men in a reported Armenian attack on Azerbaijani villages near the 
Iranian border, to skirmishes between 300 and 400 men on each side around 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and to attacks by fewer than 25 men on isolated settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's mission in Moscow, meanwhile, charged that Armenia committed 
"armed aggression" against it by sending helicopters to strafe Azerbaijani 
villages and that such action "cannot be described as anything other than war." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Yazov, speaking in an interview on Radio Moscow, said there were not 
enough internal security troops -- now numbering more than 24,000 in the region 
-- to halt the fighting. He blamed the size of the area, its difficult terrain 
and the inflamed passions among the people. 
</P>
<P>
"A decision has been adopted in this connection to carry out a full 
mobilization of formations from certain regions of the Soviet Union to enable 
them to take part in the maintenance of order, discipline and good organization 
of the state of emergency," Yazov said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the troops, and particularly the troops of the Interior Ministry -- 
and indeed without the troops of the Soviet army -- it would be impossible to 
implement the imposed state of emergency or the curfew. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is vital, essential to control centers of population, roads, state 
enterprises and (government) institutions and so on to prevent further chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Yazov did not say how many reservists would be called up or how many more 
soldiers had been deployed beyond the 5,000 reported Tuesday. Men recently 
released from active duty were being recalled in "neighboring regions," he 
said, in order to bring the units up to wartime strength. 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said he understands that the reservists would be unhappy 
about their recall, but he emphasized that they were not be sent to Armenia and 
Azerbaijan with "the task of killing, shooting, going onto some offensive. This 
is principally to protect the public order." 
</P>
<P>
The continuing reduction of the Soviet armed forces has made the mobilization 
necessary, Yazov said, because Moscow no longer has additional men it could 
move to the area without stripping other regions. 
</P>
<P>
Militant Azerbaijani nationalists continued to defy the central government's 
efforts to end the unrest there by blocking the passage of Soviet troops along 
most roads and preventing their entry into many towns and villages. They also 
surrounded airfields and launched a series of strikes. Three trainloads of 
weapons, vehicles and other equipment for the internal security forces have 
been blocked. 
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani militias have also begun laying siege to government offices, 
police stations and other institutions, according to the Interior Ministry, in 
an escalation in their challenge to the central government. Rallies also were 
organized to call for the removal of the Azerbaijani government. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku, where the violence began with an anti-Armenian pogrom over the 
weekend, "extremists and hooligans continue to provoke the population," the 
Interior Ministry said. "In staging terrorist acts, robberies and pogroms, they 
are not abandoning their attempts to heighten tensions and prevent the 
stabilization of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Esteban Mamedov, a member of the Azerbaijan Defense Council formed by the 
Azerbaijani Popular Front, said a general strike was being organized throughout 
the republic. Mamedov added that entry into Baku had been blocked with 
barricades of buses and trucks and that scores of roadblocks were being 
established elsewhere to halt the troops' advance. 
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny M. Primakov, a key Gorbachev adviser and an alternate member of the 
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, held talks with Azerbaijani nationalists 
and other groups at party headquarters in Baku under heavy military guard 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He then addressed a meeting of about 10,000 outside the building, calling for 
an end to the violence. But Radio Moscow's Interfax news bulletin reported that 
the meeting quickly turned into a demonstration calling for the resignation of 
the Azerbaijani leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities have continued to evacuate the remaining 22,000 Armenian 
residents of Baku. Radio Moscow reported that 10,555 have been taken from the 
city in the past week, including 4,600 Wednesday, and the intent seems to be to 
remove all those who remained from a community that once totaled more than 
220,000. 
</P>
<P>
With Soviet news media relying more on government statements and less on their 
own reporting from the front lines -- and with foreign correspondents barred 
from the area -- only a sketchy pictured emerged of developments in the region 
around Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, reporting from the region, said that hundreds of heavily armed members of 
the Armenian and Azerbaijani militias continued to arrive, with clashes 
proliferating throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
In Nagorno-Karabakh itself, the military commandant disbanded local nationalist 
organizations and extended the nightly curfew by two hours to help maintain 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains explosive," Tass said. "Reports from 
outside the region (about possible attacks) give rise to great anxiety among 
the residents."

TAPES OF CHILDREN DECIDED THE CASE FOR MOST JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For 30 months, they sat together in the same box, mute participants in an 
exhausting, emotional legal drama. They listened to more than a hundred 
witnesses, children, police officers, medical experts, the accused. Pounds of 
evidence -- photographs, documents, diaries, checkbooks, even several pairs of 
underwear -- were brought before them. Videotapes of children sharing their 
dark, sometimes bizarre accounts with counselors were played, rewound and 
played again for their benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout it all, the eight men and four women jurors in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation case gave nothing away, surrendered no clues as to which 
way they might be leaning. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, though, it was the jurors' turn. They acquitted Ray Buckey and his 
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts of child molestation conspiracy, 
and then, in press conferences and private interviews, explained how they had 
sorted through the tangle of evidence to make their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
It was not, many of the jurors said, an easy decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at it now, I guess it's amazing we got through it," said juror Danny 
L. Kindle, 33, a grocery store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Added Mark Bassett, 33, a computer analyst: "It really was extremely stressful 
because, win or lose, it's clear that an awful lot of people have suffered an 
awful lot in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 11 jurors who agreed to be interviewed said they believed that some 
children were abused, but that the prosecution, for the most part, had failed 
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors said they were skeptical about medical evidence and confused by 
widely disparate opinions from experts on what the evidence meant. Others were 
put off by the fantastic tales of animal mutilation, satanic ritual and 
blood-drinking, which seemed to taint even the seemingly better-documented 
cases. And still others complained that they would have voted guilty on some 
counts had the children's testimony not seemed to change over the nearly three 
years of trial. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the jurors, though, the whole case seemed to turn on videotaped 
interviews of the children, which captured sessions in which young boys and 
girls employed puppets to describe alleged sexual molestations. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they were left with serious doubts about the stories the children 
told on the videotapes. The interviewers asked leading and coercive questions, 
the jurors said, and this robbed the children of their credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes," jury foreman Luis 
Chang told The Times. "The questions that were given to the children were . . . 
too biased, too leading. There was something there, physical molestation, we 
could see. (But) trying to tie Ray Buckey into it was pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the criticism was reserved for a private child therapy center, the 
Children's Institute International, which counseled and interviewed the 
children, and for police investigators who, early in the case, sent a form 
letter to McMartin parents in Manhattan Beach asking whether their children had 
been molested. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that both tactics inflamed emotions in the upscale 
community where the McMartin Pre-School was located, inflated the case out of 
proportion and in effect diluted the children's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The children were never allowed to say, in their own words, what happened to 
them," said juror John Breese, 51, a medical technician and grandfather of 
five. "When the interviewers interviewed the children, all the questions were 
leading." 
</P>
<P>
Kee Mac Farlane, the CII therapist who supervised the interviews of the 
McMartin youngsters, defended her agency's techniques. She said inconsistencies 
in the testimony of children is normal, adding that it is always difficult to 
prove child abuse cases under stringent reasonable-doubt requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't put words in their mouth," Mac Farlane said late Thursday at CII's 
Koreatown facility. "I enabled them to get over their fears and testify in 
court. The jurors' standard of judging a child's credibility was the same one 
used for adults. . . . These are not miniature adults." 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach police officials said the department would have no comment 
because of still pending civil litigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the interviews, jurors described the nine weeks of deliberations that 
produced the not guilty verdicts on 52 counts and left them deadlocked on 13 
others. A mistrial was declared in the 13 counts. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors said they began deliberations by separating each child's case. 
Slowly and methodically, they reviewed and debated the counts that related to 
each child. They would name the relevant witnesses for each child's case, 
including parents and doctors, and pore over the appropriate testimony. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot to consider. Eleven children. Sixty-five counts. More than 
60,000 pages of testimony from 124 witnesses. One thousand exhibits. Ten 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
When they hit a snag and could not agree on a particular verdict, they would 
put that count aside for later deliberation. As they accumulated verdicts, they 
would go on to the next alleged victim. 
</P>
<P>
At times, there was spirited debate over whether a child could be believed, 
according to some jurors. Much of the conflict centered on how badly 
"contaminated" they considered a child's testimony to be. 
</P>
<P>
On the apparently rare occasion when tempers flared, jury foreman Chang usually 
ordered a break and things cooled off. All in all, most jurors said, they 
worked professionally and carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no moment of crystallization when the decisions came together," said 
Bassett, whose computer firm folded during his jury service. "The verdicts we 
divided into blocks. There was an awful lot of common evidence per child. On 
determining that the evidence wasn't believable we decided 'not guilty,' and 
turned the decisions in. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually we turned them in when we had finished going through the charges 
associated with a single child, sometimes we turn in blocks of charges for two 
children in one day." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the jury deadlocked on 13 counts where at least some members of the 
panel felt convinced of Ray Buckey's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Sally Cordova, 27, a cashier for Vons markets, said she voted guilty on 
11 of the 13 counts that ended in deadlock. Twelve involved Ray Buckey and the 
13th was a shared conspiracy count. Three of the counts involved an alleged 
victim whom Cordova believed. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed the statements that the girl first made on tape during the CII 
interview," Cordova said. "The first interview gave what I thought was concrete 
information when she accused Ray of molestation. I believed her on those three 
(early) counts. I believe that Ray did it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she is bothered by the final outcome, Cordova said, "I feel we 
did the best we could." 
</P>
<P>
Kindle said he leaned toward guilty verdicts for Ray Buckey, but eventually was 
convinced by the others that some children seemed to have had "words put in 
their mouths" by their interrogators -- though he remains unconvinced that all 
of the children were lying. 
</P>
<P>
And with some of the older children, he decided that the statute of limitations 
probably had expired. Such was the case of one girl who accused Buckey of 
molesting her during the so-called "naked movie star" game in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty definite that she had been molested," Kindle said. "She pointed 
the finger toward Ray. She said Ray did it. But I think in that case, the 
statute of limitations had run out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"After you hear so many children say, 'Ray did it,' even if they were led, it's 
hard for me to believe that they were lying." 
</P>
<P>
But others were not swayed by the testimony against the Buckeys. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence was not concrete," said Barbara Celestine, who works for the U.S. 
Air Force in El Segundo and is a mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
Celestine, who filled 18 books with notes during the trial, said many of the 
children's statements seemed rehearsed or scripted and added that the alleged 
victims who testified did not show the emotion or fear she would have expected. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Ochoa, a 41-year-old state employee, blamed the police department letter 
for severely damaging the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
"That right there almost wrecked the chances of the prosecution," Ochoa, 41, 
said, adding he was convinced no molestation had ever taken place. "There were 
incredible missteps that contributed to this big mess. That was a shotgun 
approach to gathering data." 
</P>
<P>
One juror, a retired, 75-year-old structural draftsman who asked that his name 
not be published, said he was determined to vote not guilty as soon as the 
testimony was over -- especially where Peggy McMartin Buckey was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," said this juror. "Here's a woman that has been in this 
business for, what, 26 years? Isn't it incredible to believe she would do the 
things she was accused of doing? You just couldn't understand how she would get 
any pleasure out of such feelings." 
</P>
<P>
This juror said adult eyewitnesses might have changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The fantastic nature of many of the children's stories bewildered jurors. 
</P>
<P>
One was a so-called "lookout game," in which a child allegedly watched for 
parents coming to pick up a playmate and notified Buckey as to the imminent 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the stories became ridiculous," Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided," he went on, "that there couldn't have been enough time to run 
from the window to the room where the molestation was supposed to be happening 
and for Ray and the children -- who were supposed to be naked -- to get their 
clothes on and go out and meet the parents. We figured that all that would have 
had to take place in 20 seconds or less. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Celestine and Bassett said an alleged incident in which a horse was supposed to 
have been killed with a baseball bat, and the children made to drink the blood, 
fed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"God, that got to me," Celestine said. "It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bassett: "My father and uncle own a farm that has horses on it. I've been 
around horses. I know they're fairly big. The thing about killing a horse with 
a baseball bat. If Ray were to try that, I don't think the horse would just 
calmly stand there." 
</P>
<P>
The trial changed the lives of scores of people, and the jury was not excepted. 
Some jurors said they sought to maintain their sanity with crossword puzzles 
and chess games during breaks. Many could not avoid taking the case home with 
them at night. They had dreams. Several said they will be forever haunted by 
the experience. 
</P>
<P>
One juror, Cordova, remembered visiting a church at Christmas when her thoughts 
flashed to allegations by one child that animals were sacrificed at the altar 
of a Hermosa Beach church, where children were molested. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, the only thing I could think of was the kids back in court," she 
said. "Forever, I will be reminded unintentionally of the case. . . . I'm sure 
it will happen again and again." 
</P>
<P>
After it was finished, most of the jurors were simply happy to be going home. A 
few laughed at having received summons for jury duty during the McMartin trial. 
A couple planned to see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
"After spending a certain amount of time you learn a certain respect," Bassett 
said. "It's like wartime. You're in the foxhole with your buddies and you have 
to stick together."

STAGE SET FOR SHOWDOWN ON FAMILY-PLANNING FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
SACRAMENTO: THE LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLY BACKS RESTORATION OF $20-MILLION CUT 
BY THE GOVERNOR. A VETO OVERRIDE IS A POSSIBILITY.

<P>
Setting the stage for a possible veto override, the Assembly on Thursday 
overwhelmingly approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to restore 
$20 million in family-planning funds that he struck down last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan 65-8 vote on the controversial issue follows a similarly 
lopsided vote in the Senate. If the governor vetoes the bill to restore funds 
to California's 500 clinics for poor women, proponents promise a vigorous 
campaign to bring the issue to an override vote in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A gubernatorial veto override requires a two-thirds majority of both houses -- 
or 54 votes in the Assembly and 27 in the Senate. A successful override would 
be the first of a Deukmejian veto in his two terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
As the financial pinch on the clinics serving 500,000 women statewide 
continues, the issue is a long-standing point of contention between Deukmejian 
and legislators -- growing in number -- who favor restoration of the funds. 
Deukmejian's cut of clinic funds from $36 million down to $12 million has also 
been successfully challenged in lower courts and is now before the state 
Supreme Court -- a development that has especially rankled the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has criticized the Legislature for trying to rush the bill that 
would restore $20 million for the program, under which women receive treatment, 
screening and advice on health and reproductive matters including family 
planning. The governor has wanted the Legislature to wait until the issue has 
been resolved by the courts. He has complained that the court ruling "goes to 
the issue" of a governor's constitutional powers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), chairman of the Health Committee 
and author of the restoration bill, indicated there is scant sentiment for 
further delays. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a stronger vote than anyone would have imagined when we came in 
here this morning," Bronzan said. " . . . I think it would be hard for the 
governor not to recognize the strong feelings on the part of the Republicans. I 
think he will find a way to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he thinks he already has the necessary votes to override in the 
Senate -- where the vote for restoring clinic funds was 30 to 5 on Tuesday -- 
and is only "two or three votes away" in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A press spokesman for the governor, Tom Beermann, declined to say what 
Deukmejian will do with the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor will review the bill and take action based on the merits," 
Beermann said. "At this point, an override is not a consideration" influencing 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has 12 days in which to sign, veto or allow the bill to become law 
without his signature. The earliest he could receive it would be today. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, casting a vote to pass a bill and casting a vote to override a 
veto are two vastly different actions. A vote to override is especially 
difficult for members of the governor's own political party. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, a solid Assembly GOP bloc has made Deukmejian immune from being 
overridden, but Thursday's vote on the family-planning issue -- with 22 
affirmative Republican votes -- indicated that the bloc could be cracking. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, some vote counters privately indicated that if the governor 
vetoes the bill, the action probably would be overridden, provided that the 
Democrats stick together and enough Republicans break away from their lame-duck 
party leader on an issue that they believe is very popular with constituents. 
Senate Republicans generally are more independent than their Assembly 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly GOP floor leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who did not vote on the 
measure, said: "George Deukmejian has never been overridden and I do not expect 
he will be overridden on this bill. We will continue to negotiate in good faith 
on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson conceded that the size of the bipartisan vote was a "clear message 
that a great many Republicans support the idea of family planning and are 
satisfied with the language of this bill." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he abstained from voting on the legislation, Johnson said he was 
"torn" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Bronzan said, "This is an issue that won't go away. It 
gets worse. Thirty-seven clinics have closed their doors. One-half-million 
women in California are served by this program. 
</P>
<P>
"If these funds aren't restored, there will be an additional 56,000 unwanted 
pregnancies and 22,000 of these will terminate in abortions." 
</P>
<P>
He said the bill guarantees that no family-planning funds would go for 
abortions or abortion services. 
</P>
<P>
But an opponent, Assemblyman Philip Wyman (R-Tehachapi), charged that the 
"so-called restrictions on abortions are a factual sham." 
</P>
<P>
Another foe, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach), joined 
Deukmejian in arguing that the vote should be delayed until after the courts 
act on the lawsuit filed by opponents of the governor's family-planning funds 
cutback. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court judge ordered Deukmejian to restore the money last December, but 
appeals by the state held up release of the funds. The Supreme Court has yet to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the roll-call vote by which the Assembly voted 65 to 8 to restore 
family-planning funds vetoed by the governor from the state budget:

COMPUTER ACE INDICTED IN TAPPING OF U.S. NETWORK 
</P>

<P>
A computer hacker who once gained fame by breaking into the UCLA computer 
system has been indicted on charges of invading a classified military computer, 
stealing the unlisted telephone numbers of the Soviet Consulate in San 
Francisco, and routinely breaching Pacific Bell's security. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also alleges that in January, 1988, Kevin L. Poulsen, 24, then a 
computer expert at SRI International in the Silicon Valley, stole a printout of 
the unlisted phone numbers of Ferdinand E. Marcos and several cronies. The FBI 
was using the numbers in its investigation of the late Philippine president, 
who then was living in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensitive nature of the information Poulsen allegedly obtained, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Crowe of San Jose said Thursday that "it is not an 
espionage case." 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen is still at large. Prosecutors believe that he is hiding in the Los 
Angeles area. He called authorities earlier this week, but used his skill with 
telephones to evade a phone trace, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
His two co-defendants have turned themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment does not charge that Poulsen sold the material he obtained, such 
as the Soviet Consultate telephone numbers. Instead, he is accused of 
possessing what he took -- computer access codes, telephone credit cards 
numbers, and, more significantly, plans relating to a 1988 Army exercise out of 
Ft. Bragg, N.C. The plan was classified as "secret" when he stole it, but since 
has been declassified. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said Poulsen gained access to the classified Army MASNET 
computer network. But the indictment does not specify how he gained such access 
or how he obtained the Soviet Consulate numbers from the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen also is charged with tapping the phone conversations of a North 
Hollywood family, apparently because he was infatuated with the daughter. The 
FBI discovered Poulsen's tapes of the family's phone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin is a very lonely and sad person. He felt powerless in his life and doing 
this was a way for him to have power," Annette Randol, mother of Sean Randol, 
the young North Hollywood woman who had caught Poulsen's fancy, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Randol said Poulsen dropped by the Randol home in 1984, boasting that 
the prestigious SRI of Menlo Park offered him a job after seeing articles about 
his hacking exploits. At the age of 17 in 1983, Poulsen made headlines when Los 
Angeles law enforcement authorities investigated him and a friend for what was 
one of the earliest known computer break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
He had used a Radio Shack laptop computer to gain wide-ranging access to a 
university research network. Although Poulsen acknowledged his activities, he 
said at the time that he did not realize he was doing something wrong. He was 
never charged, but his friend was sentenced to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who hired him did know he had some hacker experience in his 
background, but he was a very bright guy," said Donn Parker, security expert 
with SRI. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in the indictment unsealed on Wednesday were Mark K. Lottor, 25, 
of Menlo Park, and Robert E. Gilligan, 31, of San Francisco, also past or 
present SRI computer employees. 
</P>
<P>
Poulsen faces up to 37 years in prison. Lottor and Gilligan could be sentenced 
to up to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment says Poulsen and his roommate, Lottor, carried out their 
activities from their Menlo Park apartment living room, which they dubbed "the 
Switching Room" and had equipped with computers and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also accuses Poulsen of using Pacific Bell identification badges 
to gain access to its facilities, and then stealing various items. 
Additionally, Poulsen allegedly intercepted phone calls placed by Pacific Bell 
itself -- as part of an effort to obstruct the company's investigation of him.

HIGH COURT LIMITS DEFENDANTS' ACCESS TO DATA ON INFORMANTS

<P>
In a victory for prosecutors, the state Supreme Court on Thursday limited the 
ability of defendants to obtain information from law enforcement authorities on 
the reliability of confidential police informants. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-2 ruling came in a legal clash that pitted the need of police to protect 
the identity of informants against the right of defendants to contest search 
warrants that have led to their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The court majority said that in order to get police records to help challenge 
warrants based on informants' tips, the accused must first offer evidence 
casting "reasonable doubt" on such matters as an informant's past reliability 
or the information he provided police. 
</P>
<P>
The justices substantially modified a 1985 high court ruling that had given 
defendants wide latitude to obtain information about an informant, provided 
that a judge screened it first and removed the name of the informant. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of prosecutors and conservative legal groups challenged the 1985 
decision, saying it had opened the way for "fishing expeditions" by defense 
attorneys and, despite judicial screening, could lead to inadvertent disclosure 
of informants' identities, placing their lives at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court, in a 36-page opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, 
agreed that the 1985 decision was "inappropriately broad" and should be trimmed 
back. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard, said 
Thursday's ruling placed an "unrealistic" burden on defendants, who now will 
risk being denied the very information they need to challenge an informant's 
reliability. The dissenters said that the court's new, tougher standard would 
make it too easy to hide information casting doubt on an informant's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Ronald S. Matthias welcomed the ruling, saying it would 
resolve conflicting interpretations of the 1985 ruling that had caused 
confusion and uncertainty among trial judges, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys. The decision also is likely to reduce the chances an informant's 
identity could be learned from disclosure of information, Matthias said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the defendant in the case could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in July, 1985, when police in Contra Costa County obtained a 
warrant to search the home of George Luttenberger for evidence that he was 
dealing in illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit accompanying the warrant was signed by a police officer who said 
he had received information on Luttenberger's alleged activities from a 
confidential informant -- referred to only as "CRI" -- who had proved reliable 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent search, police found methamphetamine, marijuana, syringes, 
drug-altering substances, $880 in cash and two loaded handguns. Luttenberger 
was charged with possession of illegal drugs for sale. 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to challenging the validity of the warrant, Luttenberger asked 
that police be required turn over any information on the informant's past 
experiences with illegal drugs, police reports and any pay vouchers involving 
the informant, and any promises made to the informant by police. 
</P>
<P>
A magistrate denied the request, and Luttenberger, who had pleaded not guilty, 
sought dismissal of the charges because he had been refused access to police 
records. The trial judge dismissed the case and a state Court of Appeal, citing 
the 1985 high court ruling, upheld that action. Thursday's decision sent the 
case back to the trial court for further proceedings.

MONTOYA SAYS UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT SET HIM UP

<P>
State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya, continuing to defend himself on corruption 
charges, contended Thursday he was set up by a federal undercover agent who 
gave him a $3,000 check at a videotaped breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Undergoing a second day of grueling cross-examination, Montoya also testified 
that he proposed the $3,000 figure in order "to put a little bit of a 
limitation" on the amount he would receive from the undercover agent, who was 
posing as a Southern businessman. 
</P>
<P>
And the Whittier Democrat denied ever seeing a "schedule of fees" sent by his 
office to then-sports agent Michael Trope spelling out how he could pay the 
senator $10,000 in campaign contributions and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya acknowledged signing a letter to Trope that referred to the payment 
schedule but said, "I've indicated that this schedule of fees is not anything I 
saw or that I approved." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is on trial in federal court on 10 counts of extortion, racketeering 
and money laundering arising from a four-year investigation of political 
corruption in the state Capitol. Until now, the defense has not contended that 
the senator was entrapped by federal agents, who set up a phony shrimp company 
and pushed legislation to benefit it. But Montoya, adopting a combative tone 
Thursday, suggested that the federal government had unfairly snared him. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp questioning, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Panneton called on the senator 
to explain crucial parts of the videotaped conversation in which Montoya 
received the $3,000 check from undercover agent George Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after handing Montoya the check, according to the videotape, Murray 
told the senator that his action in getting the bogus FBI legislation out of a 
Senate committee was "worth about 10 times" the $3,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it clear you were getting paid for your vote?" Panneton asked Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
The senator replied: "What is clear to me is this is very much a part of the 
set-up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier tape-recorded meeting with undercover informant John Shahabian, 
Montoya had discussed the amount of the honorarium he would receive. After 
learning that other lawmakers were getting payments of $5,000 and $7,500, 
Montoya said, "I wouldn't want to do more than three," adding, "You don't want 
to appear ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Panneton asked Montoya whether he had picked a lesser amount in order to avoid 
media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to put a little bit of a limitation on what he was saying," 
Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
Panneton also pounded away at Montoya on other bills involved in the senator's 
alleged extortion efforts, including measures that would have affected both the 
National Football League Players' Assn. and Trope. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, players' representative David Meggysey sent the senator a letter 
thanking him for siding with the union. Montoya acknowledged that he wrote a 
notation to one of his aides on the letter, saying, "Bug me. I still have to 
get them rolling." Prosecutors contend this was a reference to raising money, 
but Montoya denied that. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Montoya turned his back on the union after it refused 
to contribute and that the senator began promoting legislation to benefit 
Trope, an adversary of the association. Montoya acknowledged Trope was angered 
by the schedule of fees but eventually gave him a total of $8,100 in campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya repeatedly denied that he pressured Trope to give him the money. 
"Absolutely not. He was a friend," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya acknowledged giving Trope a book with the handwritten inscription, 
"Mike, when can we do business together again?" But he said the message was a 
reference to sports videos Trope was producing, not campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya and his attorneys have attempted to portray him as a reformer who 
co-authored Proposition 73, a campaign finance measure approved by voters in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But that contention was undercut Thursday when Montoya acknowledged that there 
were "loopholes" in the measure and that he staged a "last-chance" fund-raiser 
for his campaign only weeks before the ballot measure was passed. He 
acknowledged that at least one special-interest group, the California Medical 
Assn., had provided financial backing for it. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, sponsored by Montoya and two other legislators, was a rival 
measure to Proposition 68, designed to clean up corruption in politics by 
providing for public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya refused to concede specific flaws in his initiative, including a 
contention by Panneton that a purported $1,000 limit on honorariums can easily 
be circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure there is any initiative you can put together where you can't find 
loopholes," Montoya told the jury.

Smith, 31, of St. Louis, was executed for the 1980 beating death of

Roberts because he believed she gave him a venereal disease. The Supreme Court 
rejected a last-ditch appeal by death-penalty opponents.

U.S. CHARTING NEW GUIDELINES FOR EAST EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: THE ADMINISTRATION SEEKS CRITERIA ON PROMOTING DEMOCRACY AND 
ECONOMIC REFORM.

<P>
WASHINGTON -- The Bush Administration, criticized for its tentative approach 
toward the changes sweeping the Communist world, is striving to develop a new 
policy framework for dealing with Eastern Europe that can be unveiled in the 
President's State of the Union message on Jan. 31, according to senior 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The previous U.S. policy of "differentiation," under which the six East 
European nations were punished or rewarded according to their relative foreign 
policy independence from Moscow, has been overtaken by the ongoing revolutions 
in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government agencies now are seeking to hammer out "a framework, four or 
six criteria," to help judge future events in Eastern Europe and to guide 
American efforts to promote democracy and economic reform in the region, a 
senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
The framework would influence the future of the region in several significant 
ways. The standards are likely to help shape the policies of allied nations 
toward Eastern Europe, as well as the actions of private firms considering 
investments in the area. They also will influence Eastern European nations 
seeking U.S. aid and "encourage the recalcitrants among them to push on with 
reforms," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the framework would build on President Bush's statement to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in December, after his Malta summit with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that the task ahead was "to consolidate 
the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture for 
continued peaceful change. 
</P>
<P>
"Great choices are being made," the President said then, "and greater 
opportunities beckon." 
</P>
<P>
In formulating a new approach, however, Washington is aware of dangers both 
large and small, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States probably cannot avoid responsibility for helping to reshape 
the political, economic and security future of Eastern Europe, as it tried to 
do between World War I and World War II, with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. leaders also do not want to appear to be helping Moscow, in the name of 
stability, to dilute and divert the democratic revolts in Eastern Europe toward 
another type of communism, albeit a reformed one. 
</P>
<P>
In broad terms, White House officials have said the United States wants stable, 
multi-party democracies, based on free elections, to emerge in East Europe. It 
wants the region to develop free-market economies. And it wants the nations to 
become integrated, politically and economically, into Western Europe and the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
However, "the political opposition is weak, sometimes almost a vacuum, in those 
countries now," another senior official said. "There's no parliament to absorb 
the ethnic hostilities and other tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"If elections are held too soon," he said, "the discredited Communist parties 
are best organized to fight them. But if postponed, you run the risk of more 
demonstrations that could really turn nasty." 
</P>
<P>
And as a general principle, he noted, the United States does not want to be in 
the position of urging that elections be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
"So we can state a principle like multi-party democracy, but I can't see us 
trying to provide a formula for getting there," the official said, 
"particularly one that could be applied to all of those countries." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, rapid movement toward free-market economies easily could worsen 
rather than improve conditions in some nations. And mechanisms for integrating 
those nations into Western institutions are far from clear. 
</P>
<P>
A major consideration affecting Administration policy deliberations, one 
official said, is the question: "Where is the money coming from?" 
</P>
<P>
Budgetary constraints are a very serious problem, and most of the foreign aid 
funds appropriated by Congress are earmarked for specific countries, leaving 
the Administration little flexibility in their distribution. 
</P>
<P>
For example, only $500,000 could be provided to Romania after its bloody 
revolution last month, plus another $20,000 in discretionary funds available to 
the American ambassador there. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has proposed shifting to East Europe 
and Latin America about 5%, or $330 million, of the foreign aid funds now 
earmarked for Israel, Egypt and three other key recipients. The idea has drawn 
protests from Israel's supporters but has been applauded by the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six members of the Soviet Bloc, three are considered relatively healthy 
-- East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, with the Czechoslovaks perhaps 
best off. Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are "seriously troubled," an official 
said, although Poland has shown recent signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Poland and Hungary now enjoy most-favored-nation trading status, which 
eliminates tariffs on most of their exports to the United States. The other 
countries are considered eligible for the same treatment, following their 
adoption of new human rights and immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia is expected to be granted most-favored-nation status soon, 
perhaps when Secretary of State James A. Baker III visits Prague in early 
February on his return from Moscow. "The others can't be far behind," said a 
senior U.S. economic official. 
</P>
<P>
Poland and Hungary already have received more than $1 billion in U.S. and 
Western European aid, but the U.S. largesse "won't be replicated for the other 
countries," the official said. Poland enjoys an influential political 
constituency on Capitol Hill, he noted, adding: "Hungary was just lucky that it 
came along at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
As for the other nations, Romania is expected to get significant aid from 
France, in part because of a large Romanian community in that nation. East 
Germany has been promised considerable help from West Germany following new 
elections. Bulgaria, which has huge economic problems, is "an orphan," another 
official remarked. 
</P>
<P>
In formulating the new policy toward Eastern Europe, differences on security 
issues have surfaced between the White House and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials tend to dismiss the Warsaw Pact as a hollow 
alliance, but one that should be preserved temporarily to manage arms 
reductions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential aides, on the other hand, are concerned about the continuing 
Soviet military presence in East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But there is sentiment within the Administration for finessing the matter of 
European security for now."I don't think we should be sure of what we want 
there now," said a senior official, in view of the many crosscurrents and 
uncertainties still affecting the area.

SOVIET UNION: LEADER HAS TRANSFORMED CHALLENGES INTO BREAKTHROUGHS. BUT THE 
CIVIL WAR IN THE SOUTH IS ONE CRISIS HE APPEARED TO BE UNPREPARED FOR.

<P>
Crises are not new to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and he moves from one to 
the next with a determination that nothing will halt his plans to reform the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the Soviet leader has dealt with the dramatic upheaval in 
Eastern Europe, with an unprecedented wave of potentially paralyzing strikes at 
home, with ethnic riots and nationalist protests in most of the country's 
constituent republics, with resistance from conservatives to his reforms and 
with rising social discontent that brought increased crime and threatened bread 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these crises he turned to his own advantage, transforming challenges 
into opportunities for bold political and economic breakthroughs, often taking 
apparent vulnerabilities and creating new strength from them. 
</P>
<P>
But the virtual civil war that erupted this week in the south, between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan, is one crisis for which Gorbachev appears to have been 
unprepared, one that will not be dealt with quickly or easily -- and one that 
seems to hold very little prospect for such a magical transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the enmity between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis centuries old 
and deep-seated, but it is now burning with an increasing intensity. 
</P>
<P>
There are fears in political circles here that the burden on Gorbachev has 
become too large, that with each new crisis he approaches the limits of the 
room in which he has to maneuver and that his "new political thinking" is more 
difficult to apply to domestic problems than it was to international issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nation Has No Choice 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, defending his reforms Thursday at a Kremlin conference of workers, 
farmers and technical personnel, insisted that the nation has no choice but to 
proceed, even more boldly than before, with perestroika, his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply cannot continue to live as we have done," he said, responding to 
widespread conservative sentiment that the country's problems would be eased if 
it returned to the old methods. "Yes, we need perestroika as we need air. We 
need it to reveal the potential of our system. . . . (Results) are in progress. 
This too must be seen so as not to get into a flap, saying everything is going 
to pieces. What is falling apart are the old ways." 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Armenia and Azerbaijan is too far from the central questions 
facing Gorbachev -- how to restructure the Soviet economy so that the country 
emerges from its prolonged stagnation, how to share political power and avoid 
drifting without direction, how to recover the nation's moral strength -- to 
determine the success or failure of perestroika or his tenure as the Soviet 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
But that conflict, and its growth, reflects many of the problems facing 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis had been building for many months. Nearly two years ago, 32 people 
were killed in anti-Armenian riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and 
tension had remained high, particularly around the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of Christian Armenians in predominantly Muslim 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, true to his belief that political solutions can be found even for 
the toughest problems, had doggedly pursued a compromise that not only would 
satisfy the Armenians and Azerbaijanis but, according to senior Communist Party 
officials, also would contribute to his search for a new federal structure that 
will balance the differing interests of the Soviet Union's many ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
To Gorbachev, according to party officials who know his thinking, the process 
of negotiation is nearly as important as the result, for he sees it playing an 
essential role in creating the new political system he wants for the country 
and in making that system work in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But those long talks led nowhere, and a top party official involved in them 
told the newspaper Literary Gazette, "The time for productive interference has 
been lost, and the situation is beyond control now." 
</P>
<P>
The present crisis became all but inevitable at the end of November when the 
central government, frustrated by the lack of agreement, reaffirmed 
Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan and decided to end its administration of 
the region. Armenia reacted by moving to annex the territory, and Azerbaijan 
responded with its own countermeasures. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Armenian attacks last weekend, in which scores of people died, 
resulted directly from the frustrations of the tens of thousands of 
Azerbaijanis who had fled their homes in Armenia over the last two years but 
who were still living as refugees, without proper housing or jobs, in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have been prepared for the Armenian and Azerbaijani reactions, and 
we weren't," a political commentator remarked. "Whatever hope there might have 
been was lost at that point. Tensions, which had remained high, built up and 
exploded, simply exploded. And now we have a Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
Questions are now being asked why the government moved so slowly, why only now 
it is deploying troops to restore order. Speakers who took the floor after 
Gorbachev at the Kremlin declared again and again that, as one worker put it, 
"our country must be led." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of letters to the editors are arriving daily at the country's major 
newspapers with comments on the situation in Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the 
prevailing sentiment is for much firmer action. 
</P>
<P>
"You read these letters and you realize how conservative a nation we are, how 
we yearn for stern rulers, and how little changed we are," an editor at a 
weekly journal remarked. "These people do not say they want a return to the old 
days, but they do expect the law to be upheld and transgressors to be punished. 
. . . The political resolution of disputes is good, they feel, but if it fails, 
they ask, 'Where is the Red Army?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even a commentator writing for the government newspaper Izvestia noted this 
week, in supporting the decision to use troops to restore order in Azerbaijan: 
"No one can rebuke the leadership for showing a lack of restraint. To the 
contrary, it was satisfied for too long with using only political means." 
</P>
<P>
The leadership did move slowly in sending more peacekeeping troops to the 
region, and deliberately so, several well-informed sources said after a 
briefing at party headquarters this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Tbilisi syndrome," a political commentator said, referring to the 
decision last April to use troops to break up a demonstration in the Georgian 
capital of Tbilisi. At least 20 people were killed there, mostly women and the 
elderly, when the soldiers beat them with shovels and clubs and used gas to 
clear the square outside the government offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If you use the army," the commentator went on, "you risk serious violence with 
unpredictable results. This leadership will think very long and very hard about 
using the army unless the situation is truly out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Threat 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev may also have hesitated to send troops into the region for fear of 
giving comfort to his conservative critics, with whom he is now battling over 
the new party platform and his desire to accelerate and broaden the country's 
political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A further factor, cited by Western diplomats here, might have been a fear of 
alienating the country's numerous and increasingly militant Muslims. Totaling 
more than 50 million, they are the majority in six of the Soviet Union's 15 
constituent republics. Iran, which borders Azerbaijan and shares religious and 
cultural links with it, warned Moscow this week against suppressing the Muslims 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But a major factor in determining Gorbachev's response to the conflict appears 
to have been his preoccupation with half a dozen other pressing issues. 
</P>
<P>
As the crisis broke with a wave of anti-Armenian violence last weekend that 
left more than 40 people dead in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, Gorbachev had 
just returned from his trip to Lithuania, where he attempted to persuade the 
leaders of that Baltic republic to remain within a liberalized Soviet 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
He had other problems, too -- the new Communist Party platform to be adopted 
later this month and already the focus of sharp contention; the emergency 
program for an economy that seems only to get worse; slowness in enacting the 
legislation needed to underpin his whole reform program. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenia and Azerbaijan had long become a chronic problem, and it was always on 
our horizon, but not in the middle, not up front," a senior party official said 
this week. "We will restore order there, and we will get through this crisis. 
We will look for an equitable settlement there -- but we might not find one 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"But we will not allow ourselves to distracted from our overall goals, and we 
will not be deterred from pursuing perestroika and democratization. On that, 
Mikhail Gorbachev is very firm."

FEW ARMENIANS WOULD QUALIFY FOR U.S. REFUGEE STATUS, OFFICIAL SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: APPLICATIONS EXPECTED TO INCREASE. MANY WILL BE UNABLE TO PROVE 
POLITICAL PERSECUTION.

<P>
Administrator Gene McNary of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said 
Thursday that he expects more Armenians to seek refugee status in the United 
States, but he doubts that many could qualify by proving they were fleeing 
political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians have been coming saying they're looking for a better way of life," 
he said, noting long lines of people at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. "But they 
haven't said the magic words or made the case." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a news conference, McNary, who recently returned from 
a fact-finding trip to the Soviet Union, said Armenians would have to convince 
U.S. authorities that they hold "a well-founded fear of persecution" to qualify 
as refugees. If they fail to demonstrate persecution, "it takes them out of 
that particular category," he added. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said Armenians rejected as refugees could apply to enter the 
country under humanitarian parole. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's office has said 
that up to 2,000 Soviet citizens per month could enter the nation under that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Jervis, assistant director for public relations at INS, said those Soviets 
who enter as humanitarian parolees would have no official status in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"They would come in in a kind of limbo," he said. "They couldn't get a passport 
and couldn't leave the country without obtaining a re-entry document." 
</P>
<P>
McNary said he spent last week in Moscow and Rome to assess the agency's 
ability to process the large numbers of Soviets who are seeking to enter the 
United States. He said the Moscow INS office will grow from 18 to 22 people by 
June, when officials will be shifted from Rome to process the increasing load 
of applications. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who want to come to this country," he said. "We're 
sensitive to their issues." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the liberal changes taking place in the Soviet Union "amazing," McNary 
said Soviet officials are considering immigration laws and bilateral agreements 
that would make it easier for Soviets to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is "difficult" for him to determine from his seven-day 
visit exactly how much political intimidation was taking place in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"So far as we could tell, there are situations which would indicate a 
well-founded fear of persecution . . . for Soviet Jews and evangelical 
Christians in almost every case," he said. "That results from a requirement 
that the Soviets have that religions must register. Some are fearful of 
registering because they anticipate being identified then and singled out for 
persecution." 
</P>
<P>
McNary said the trip convinced him that the Soviet people were free to apply 
for refugee status. "The crowds outside the (U.S.) embassy would indicate 
that's true," he said, adding the INS would consider granting refugee status to 
applicants on a "case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. guidelines, the INS has an allocation for up to 50,000 Soviets to 
enter the country as refugees in 1991. McNary said those Soviets who have 
applied from the U.S. Embassy in Rome would be given first preference for 
admittance because "they were already in the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
In other issues addressed during the news conference, McNary criticized a 
report released last week by the California Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission that accused the INS of ineffectively enforcing laws to prevent 
discrimination against "foreign-looking" citizens seeking work in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that employers prove they are not intentionally hiring illegal 
aliens and provides for fines of up to $10,000. The commission recommended that 
the INS suspend enforcement of employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"The California report was not a survey," McNary said. "It was based on 
testimony of people who went in with a preconceived notion." 
</P>
<P>
McNary said he continues to support the employer sanctions provisions of the 
1986 immigration reform law and denied the law contributes to discrimination. 
"There is discrimination," he said. "But the discrimination was there before 
(the law went into effect). There's no way to prove that the law causes 
discrimination."

HARRIED DRUG LORDS SEEKING TIME TO REGROUP, ANALYSTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA: TRAFFICKERS' PEACE OVERTURE IS SEEN AS A BID FOR A RESPITE FROM SUCH 
ACTIONS AS EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES.

<P>
Beleaguered Colombian drug lords are suing for peace, but they are unlikely to 
throw themselves to the mercy of government authorities and courts, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they seem to be seeking an accommodation that will give them respite 
from official action against them in return for an end to their 
"narco-terrorist" activities. And high on the list of official action the 
traffickers are known to hate and fear is extradition to the United States for 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic declaration this week, the traffickers acknowledged the supremacy 
of the Colombian government and announced a halt in their campaign of murders, 
bombings and kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Colombians, President Bush expressed skepticism over the declaration, 
in which the drug lords also promised to suspend cocaine shipments and turn 
over weapons if they receive "constitutional and legal guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
The document was delivered Wednesday with the release of a mother and daughter 
who were kidnaped in mid-December. On Thursday, the traffickers released a 
third hostage, businessman Roberto Toro, in the city of Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Toro, who was kidnaped Dec. 14, brought a verbal message from "the 
Extraditables," as the traffickers call themselves in public statements. 
</P>
<P>
According to Toro, they said they would free all of their hostages, believed to 
number about 20. Toro also said they posed a question for the Bush 
Administration and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration: "If you do not 
believe the word of narcotraficantes, why do you negotiate with them, why do 
you have them testify against other narcotraficantes?" 
</P>
<P>
The example of plea-bargaining in U.S. drug cases has been used here to rebut 
official Colombian policy against negotiating a peace settlement with drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The Extraditables have been seeking negotiations with the government of 
President Virgilio Barco Vargas since he signed an emergency decree Aug. 18 
permitting extradition of accused drug traffickers to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In previous messages, the traffickers have made it clear that the main issue 
they wish to negotiate is extradition. Barco has refused, and 13 Colombians 
have been extradited under the August decree. In retaliation for the 
extraditions and for raids on properties owned by traffickers, they launched a 
terrorist bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In December, after security forces killed drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in 
a shoot-out, the traffickers began a campaign of kidnapings. Rodriguez Gacha, 
one of the three top chieftains of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, was 
wanted by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, two former presidents and the archbishop of Bogota signed an 
open letter proposing that the traffickers release their hostages and stop 
dealing cocaine in hopes of "less rigorous treatment" under the law. 
</P>
<P>
The army's commanding general in Medellin has said the traffickers were 
consulted on the draft text of the letter through a lawyer. Former President 
Misael Pastrana, who endorsed but did not sign the letter, said he was 
consulted on the text by former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, who Pastrana 
says called him from the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports indicate to many analysts that some sort of agreement was being 
brokered between the traffickers and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Losada, a Colombian political analyst, said he fears that the 
government may secretly have relented on extradition in exchange for peace with 
the traffickers. Government officials deny that. Losada said such an agreement 
could have disastrous consequences for Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
It would be extremely hard to determine whether traffickers were keeping a 
promise to quit the cocaine business. And even if they did, Losada said, others 
would quickly move into the lucrative field, so trafficking most likely would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
If accused traffickers were not extradited, they would be subject to Colombian 
justice. But, Losada said, bribes, intimidation and the killing of judges have 
rendered the court system in this country impotent in cases against important 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The traffickers will not change their corrupt and brutal ways of dealing with 
the courts, and the judges will continue to be cowed, Losada said. "What judge 
will have the courage to convict them or even put them on trial?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the power of the traffickers would increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The narcotraficantes would remain in Colombia with their capital," he said. 
"Then what could keep them from investing in big companies, taking over banks, 
buying politicians?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barco may have a compelling personal reason to reach an agreement 
with the traffickers. One of their hostages is the son of his friend and 
closest adviser, German Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
But Losada said any official concession could be politically costly for the 
Barco administration, which now is claiming victory over the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government gives in and relinquishes extradition, people will 
eventually realize that the Extraditables won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official in Bogota said that because the government now has the upper 
hand, it is an especially inopportune moment to give the harried traffickers a 
chance to regroup their forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are under tremendous pressures," the official said. "Their 
organization is deeply disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, Colombia should not stop extraditions until it can build "a legal 
system that has a lot of force and authority, and that is going to take a lot 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official acknowledged that willingness to negotiate is a strong 
Colombian cultural trait. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong perception in Colombian culture that gentlemen are open 
to negotiations," he said. "Even with your worst enemy, you are open to 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, while the latest peace proposal by the traffickers has raised 
some hopes for a negotiated end to the plague of "narco-terrorism," many 
Colombians remain skeptical and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper El Tiempo warned Thursday that "this could turn into a Trojan 
horse."

BAN ON IVORY TRADE TAKES EFFECT; SOME NATIONS TO DEFY IT

An international treaty to protect the dwindling herds of African elephants by 
banning trade in ivory went into force Thursday, but leading producing and 
consuming nations refused to be bound by it. 
</P>
<P>
Five African nations that regularly cull their elephant populations have filed 
for exemption, while China has said that it will continue importing tusks. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has asked for a six-month trading extension for Hong Kong to allow the 
colony to sell off its ivory stockpile of 670 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The trade ban was agreed upon after bitter debate at an October meeting of the 
103-nation Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. Countries had until 
Thursday to file for an exemption to enable them to continue trade with those 
members who also filed reservations or with the 60 countries outside the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Malawi submitted reservations by 
the deadline, said Jean-Patrick Le Duc, spokesman for the Swiss-based 
convention secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Zimbabwe, which both have large, well-managed elephant 
populations, have argued that they need revenue from ivory sales to continue 
protecting the animals successfully.

INITIAL HYSTERIA PROVOKED POSITIVE CHANGES IN DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK and CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1984 and news reports from New York to California and from 
Minnesota to Florida carried accounts of children being molested in day-care 
centers, schools and youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it seemed, virtually everyone in day-care centers -- which serve as 
surrogate parents to 16 million of the nation's children -- became a suspected 
child molester. And in such a hysterical climate, the routine act of providing 
affection through touch became taboo. 
</P>
<P>
Rocking chairs were removed from some centers, so children would not sit on the 
laps of adults. Other centers installed video cameras in classrooms to monitor 
all activities. Children's diapers were changed in the standing-up position, 
and nursery school directors stopped taking photographs of even clothed 
children at play for fear they would be accused of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Some fearful teachers quit hugging kids, instead saying, "Give yourself a pat 
on the back." Male day-care employees especially felt untrusted and in many 
cases were automatically viewed with suspicion. Many were rejected for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Liability insurance premiums soared -- forcing many small operators out of 
business and causing others to go underground, remaining open but unlicensed 
and uninsured. Large day-care operations moved toward self-insurance; 
church-run centers found protection under the umbrella of their church's 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Ways to Protect Safety 
</P>
<P>
And anxious parents started inspecting their children's genitals at bath time, 
warning them not to let anyone touch their "private parts." 
</P>
<P>
But from this tempest came some positive changes in a long-unscrutinized 
industry, in which as much as 90% of family-care operators were unlicensed and 
unregulated. Under fire from every direction, day-care centers scrambled for 
new ways to protect children's safety and to ensure that their facilities were 
not vulnerable to similar allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The McMartin case in particular led to new laws and policies that altered the 
course of child care in America. 
</P>
<P>
News accounts of nursery schools as hotbeds of molestation turned out to be 
misleading. A national study of sexual abuse in day care by the University of 
New Hampshire's family research laboratory later showed that children are 
nearly twice as likely to be molested in their own household as in a day-care 
center. And many of the highly publicized molestation cases fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly the pendulum began to swing back -- but not to the careless, unguarded 
innocence of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The mid-1980s had been a desperate time. "It got to the point where staff were 
literally afraid to pick up a crying child," said Barbara Willer, spokeswoman 
for the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) in 
Washington, "because it might be misconstrued as a sexual overture." 
</P>
<P>
Said one male day-care worker in Los Angeles: "On one hand, I never let myself 
be in a room alone with a child; yet on the other, I know they need affection, 
particularly those who have no male role models at home. They like to be 
touched, stroked, picked up and spun around, and to feel the strength of an 
adult. But I am careful." 
</P>
<P>
"Children and grown-ups all need hugs and physical affection in order to feel 
cared about," said Santa Monica therapist Ruth Bettelheim, citing several 
classic animal studies showing that monkeys denied physical contact as infants 
were unable to socialize or have sexual relations as adults. 
</P>
<P>
A drop in affection only makes children hunger for it and thus even more 
susceptible to molestation, Los Angeles child psychiatrist Michael Durfee said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, screening procedures became more stringent. Marsheen Pleak, director of 
the Palisades-Malibu YMCA after-school program in Los Angeles, acknowledged, 
"After McMartin, we started looking a lot deeper into people's backgrounds for 
things like large gaps in employment, doing fingerprint and criminal checks, 
and checking references." 
</P>
<P>
She said she looks for those who have taken courses in child development, asks 
how applicants would handle certain hypothetical situations and requires the 
staff to take part in extra training sessions. Parents are also encouraged to 
become involved. 
</P>
<P>
The YMCA-USA -- probably the largest provider of child care in the nation -- 
combines background checks and interviews, training and observation, and 
sometimes even looks for behavior patterns that police say are frequently found 
in pedophiles -- such as socializing only with children and not those in their 
own age group. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not psychology experts," said Melinda Sprague, senior vice president of 
the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles, which serves 6,000 children, "so we try 
to set up safeguards such as a policy that no staff person is to be alone with 
a child at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Many nursery schools have adopted policies that protect both teacher and child, 
such as requiring the presence of a third person when a child's injuries 
require inspection of the genital area and assigning parent helpers to escort 
toddlers to the bathroom two at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, good schools permit parents to observe their children at any 
time, unannounced, through one-way mirrors or windows. Parents are also 
encouraged -- and given tuition credits -- to donate one morning a month to 
assisting, ensuring that parent helpers are available each day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for a teacher to be able to give a hug and hold a child in her 
lap," said Marjorie Buell, who directs the Methodist Pre-School in Pacific 
Palisades. "I'd hate for us to become paranoid and I emphasize that parents can 
come and watch any time." 
</P>
<P>
NAEYC's Willer says heightened awareness has led to probationary periods for 
new employees during which they are not left alone with children without 
supervision, training has improved, and several bills before Congress and 
pending in several states would require that parents have access to child-care 
facilities whenever their children are present. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual numbers (of molestation cases) are small," Willer said. "And it's 
important that the hysteria did die down. But we need to be aware where the 
potential for sexual abuse exists and look for ways to reduce it." In Portland, 
Me., the Koala Child Kare center installed video monitors in classrooms, so the 
employees feel free to give children hugs and put their arms around them while 
reading stories, without such gestures being misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisville, Ky., where the county provides day care for nearly 2,000 
children, two adults are required to be in the classroom even when only two or 
three children are present, according to Ellen Skaikun, coordinator of 
child-care training and services. "We want to provide safeguards and we don't 
want to leave ourselves open to being accused," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experience Requirement 
</P>
<P>
She said Jefferson County is trying to professionalize their services by 
offering salaries above the minimum wage and fringe benefits, in addition to 
requiring training and experience. Many male aides work in the kindergarten 
program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had thought about these things before the mid-'80s, when the child 
molestation cases broke. But we don't want our people to have to hold back on 
expressing nice feelings for kids. Most of us know what's right and wrong. If 
somebody's going to tell me I can't touch a child I'll look for another job." 
</P>
<P>
Kinder-Care Learning Centers, headquartered in Montgomery, Ala., and licensed 
to care for 160,000 youngsters, has had an open-door policy and conducted 
reference checks on prospective employees since its inception, said vice 
president Ann Muscari, but still found room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We were outraged and made even more aware and alert by what was happening" in 
some day-care centers, she said, adding that the corporation developed a video 
called "Listen to Dolly" to make parents and children and staff aware of the 
possibilities both of abuse and molestation. "But," she added, "we never 
stopped hugging children." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the hysteria, especially involving males, has died down," said child 
psychiatrist Michael Durfee, who coordinates the Los Angeles County Health 
Department's program for abused children. But a lot of suspicion still exists. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, one out of two people will say 'no' if you ask whether they think it's 
OK for a man to change a child's diapers," he said. Until recently, males were 
not assigned to work in the nursery of the county's sole public facility for 
abused and neglected children, Durfee said, because the director was concerned 
that they would be "tempted." 
</P>
<P>
The day-care industry's forced self-examination and policing has benefited 
society in the long run, Durfee said.

AT LAST, SHADOW HAS BEEN LIFTED FROM MANHATTAN BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: A DIVIDED CITY BUZZES WITH WORD OF JURY'S DECISION. SOME WONDER IF 
THE TRUTH WILL EVER BE KNOWN. 
</P>

<P>
After more than six years, it took less than five minutes for news of Ray and 
Peggy McMartin Buckey's acquittal to spread through Manhattan Beach. The 
verdicts, televised live, had barely been uttered when phones began buzzing at 
the churches and the police station and the pastel, seaside homes. 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall, the city attorney's secretary told the receptionist, who told a 
pair of volunteer workers, who pursed their lips. At Uncle Bill's Pancake 
House, the customers at the breakfast counter exchanged shocked glances, then 
vigorous debate. 
</P>
<P>
At the community center, a grandmother in a pale-pink sweat suit passed the 
word to her low-impact aerobics class in hushed tones. A woman clapped both 
hands over her mouth. Another -- who knew "The Children" -- uncontrollably 
wept. 
</P>
<P>
And when another woman, in a small, defiant voice, announced, "Well, I, for 
one, agree with the judge," the others averted their eyes and drifted away. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see," she confided bitterly, "a lot of them don't agree with me. 
They don't like to hear this viewpoint, even now." 
</P>
<P>
It was with anguish and relief and gratitude and surprise that Manhattan Beach 
greeted the culmination of the longest criminal proceeding in U.S. history -- a 
proceeding that was launched from their own city and that, for years, has torn 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
And though opinions varied -- vehemently -- on whether the verdict matched the 
truth, there was one constant: Everyone was glad it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope now that none of the parents involved does anything to mess up their 
(own) lives any further," said Russ Lesser, who served as mayor of Manhattan 
Beach at the height of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have said in the past that if Ray Buckey gets off, they'll get 
him. But I hope now that they're saying, 'Let's move forward. Let's get on with 
our lives.' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, for him the verdict is already an anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly hasn't hurt property values here -- I can tell you that," Lesser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time in this upwardly mobile beach city when it seemed the shadow 
of McMartin would never lift. The case, people said, did not stop with a single 
preschool. Local businesses, churches and other schools were drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, authorities said they had 56 suspects still uncharged, and 1,200 
victims of alleged abuse. Seven preschools in and around Manhattan Beach 
closed. Only two ever reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that went on just added to the belief," recalled Patti Rusth, whose 
best friend's Manhattan Ranch preschool was among those closed. 
</P>
<P>
"For awhile, it was almost 'in' to be one of the people involved. There were 
public rallies with movie stars. Women (whose kids went to McMartin) would 
collapse on the tennis courts in tears and people would rush to comfort them." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors doubted neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
McMartin was on the news, in the Sunday sermons, on bumper-stickers, in 
classroom debates. 
</P>
<P>
At the abandoned preschool, which is up for sale, the graffiti, "Ray Will Die" 
showed up on the cement walls, was painted over and, within weeks, reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, it was there anew, with a fresh message alongside: "Dead." 
</P>
<P>
There were landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, longtime residents tell you which church "The Parents" go to, and 
which supermarket they patronize, and who cuts their hair and how many have 
joined the Badminton Club. They point out the meat market where pupils said 
they had been undressed in a back room. 
</P>
<P>
And there were rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Some passed, others fester to this day. Lesser's wife, Charlotte, for example, 
laughs today at the 5-year-old rumor that she routinely carried dead babies 
around town in the back of her station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
But another story still hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the vestry at St. Cross Episcopal Church, and we're constantly under 
duress and stress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that McMartin children said they were taken clandestinely to St. 
Cross in neighboring Hermosa Beach and forced to witness satanic rituals. The 
story was never substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, as recently as last month, the church and its rectory were pelted 
with broken bottles and eggs. The vandals left a note: "There is simply no 
place for Satan worship in this town." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, old questions about St. Cross were revived with the arrest of a 
47-year-old church counselor for allegedly molesting two teen-agers connected 
to the church's youth group. 
</P>
<P>
At the rectory yesterday, the Rev. Jack Eales was measured in his reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can really say is that I hope and pray that reaching this milestone (the 
verdict) leads all of us to pray for the beginning of healing in our hearts, 
our homes and our communities," he said. 
</P>

D.A. REINER MIGHT HAVE LOST MORE THAN A CASE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE ACQUITTAL COULD BE A MAJOR BLOW TO HIS CANDIDACY FOR STATE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. SOME SAY HE CAN'T WIN THE BIG ONE.

The acquittal of the McMartin defendants Thursday raised all sorts of questions 
among legal experts, educators and parents, but in state politics there was 
only one: 
</P>
<P>
"How damaging do you think this is to Ira?" 
</P>
<P>
That was the way Republican consultant Eric Rose put it, echoing some around 
the state who view Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner as a man mostly 
interested in his political prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," charged Rose, "in high-profile cases, Ira doesn't have the 
Midas touch, he's got the kiss of death." 
</P>
<P>
Rose was referring to McMartin and the Twilight Zone case, in which those 
charged in the deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two children on a movie set were 
acquitted in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who was elected district attorney in 1984, is now running for attorney 
general. Arlo Smith, his opponent in the Democratic primary, was on the attack 
-- or rather, his advisers were -- as soon as the McMartin verdict came in. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether this hurts Mr. Reiner's campaign for attorney 
general, it's whether he should resign immediately as district attorney of Los 
Angeles County," said Marc Dann, campaign manager for Smith, who is the 
district attorney of San Francisco County. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's political advisers believe the McMartin outcome could be the break 
they've been been hankering for as they try to overcome Reiner's huge advantage 
in name recognition in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the development probably will mean that Reiner will have to 
abandon his strategy of ignoring Smith. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy was tried by another Smith opponent 11 years ago, then-San 
Francisco Dist. Atty. Joseph Freitas. But Freitas infuriated gays when his 
prosecution of Dan White led to a manslaughter conviction rather than 
first-degree murder. White, who later committed suicide when he got out of 
prison, had killed San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and gay Supervisor Harvey 
Milk. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who started out in the 1979 race at below 10% in the polls, kept 
pounding away at Freitas and won the race. 
</P>
<P>
Smith manager Dann, talking so fast his words slammed into each other coming 
out of the phone, said Thursday, "Reiner's flops go back years. When he was 
city attorney for Los Angeles, the LAPD's special unit said we've got a problem 
(with spying on citizens) and you have to defend us and Reiner instead 
grandstands at a press conference and reveals confidential information, causing 
the city to have to hire independent counsel at a cost of $2 million to the 
taxpayers. The Bar censured him for it. It goes on and on. He used jailhouse 
informants . . . to help the prosecutors and one of them was even used in the 
McMartin case. I mean, it goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Told of the charges from the Smith camp, Reiner took a deep breath over the 
phone Thursday and said in gravelly, measured tones, "Arlo is being very 
unprofessional in all of this. As a prosecutor he should know better." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner added, "I was very disappointed (by the acquittal) but the jury has 
spoken." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's predecessor as district attorney, Republican Robert H. Philibosian, 
has been blamed by some for starting the McMartin prosecution in 1983 without 
carefully checking out the charges. After he took office, Reiner decided to 
prosecute only two of the seven original defendants, Peggy McMartin and Ray 
Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever wins the Democratic primary for attorney general, Reiner or Smith, will 
have to face Republican lawyer and former Rep. Dan Lungren, who has previously 
criticized Reiner for "grandstanding" in high-profile cases, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
But Lungren was circumspect Thursday, perhaps sensing that it was not the best 
time to talk politics. In a statement issued by his campaign office, he said: 
"This is not a time for political judgments and statements. I'm more concerned 
about the children and their families."

PARENT'S RELIGIOUS RIGHT OUTWEIGHS CHILD'S NEED FOR MOTHER, COURT SAYS

In a precedent-setting case, New York's highest court on Thursday said a 
parent's right to reject life-saving medical procedures outweighs the child's 
need for a mother or father. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeals also ruled that the state cannot prohibit parents from 
engaging in dangerous activities because of a risk their children might be left 
orphans. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling upheld the right of a Jehovah's Witness to reject a blood 
transfusion even though she might die and leave her newborn child motherless. 
The court said the case was the first it has ever decided in which a parent's 
constitutional rights were pitted against the welfare of her child. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the state has an interest in protecting the welfare 
of children," the court said. But it added, "The state does not prohibit 
parents from engaging in dangerous activities because there is a risk that 
their children will be left orphans." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling comes 13 months after a medical center on Long Island obtained a 
court order forcing Denise Nicoleau to have a blood transfusion after 
hemorrhaging during a Cesarean section. Nicoleau had just delivered a healthy 
baby boy.

GOP PANEL SIDESTEPS DEBATE ON PARTY'S STAND ON ABORTION

The Republican Party's internal debate over abortion boiled into the open 
Thursday, with a party committee refusing to consider a resolution affirming 
the GOP's anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on the opening day of the Republican National Committee's 
winter meeting, a session dominated by public and private discussions about 
whether the party should moderate its official stand on abortion as the 1990 
elections approach. 
</P>
<P>
The session also included a complaint from the leader of a black GOP group, who 
said that despite minority outreach commitments from party chief Lee Atwater 
some state chapters "overlook" blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Brown, head of the National Black Republican Committee, also said that 
while he has been unable to organize a presidential dinner as an organization 
fund-raiser, Jesse Jackson and other prominent black Democrats "constantly meet 
with the President." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion overshadowed other topics as the committee convened in a hotel 
blocks from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
One committee member, Idaho state GOP Chairman Randy Ayre, sought to offer a 
resolution endorsing the party's 1988 platform recognition of the "sanctity of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Ayre was told that his request would not be considered because he had not 
submitted a formal resolution in advance of the gathering and that the issue 
might be discussed at the next committee meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
Ayre said after the session that he personally opposes abortion and believes 
the party should too, but that the GOP should not use a candidate's position on 
abortion as a litmus test for party support. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater and other prominent Republicans -- including President Bush and Vice 
President Dan Quayle -- have sought in recent months to portray the GOP as an 
umbrella organization that welcomes candidates with varying views on abortion. 
And, mindful of the role abortion played in several major elections won by 
Democrats last year, Atwater has been urging Republican candidates to state 
their position on the issue early and firmly in an attempt to diminish 
abortion's campaign role.

Chinese authorities announced Thursday the release of 573 people arrested for 
taking part in last year's pro-democracy demonstrations and unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security said the prisoners had pleaded guilty and 
"showed repentance," the New China News Agency reported. It gave no names and 
did not say when the prisoners were released. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did it say how many might remain in custody in connection with the 
pro-democracy movement and anti-government activities. According to other 
sources, about 800 were arrested. These sources said that none of the student 
leaders arrested last year were among the prisoners released. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities Thursday announced harsh new punishment for Communist Party 
members involved in such things as slander, illicit sex, lavish weddings and 
costly funerals. 
</P>
<P>
Under new guidelines published in state-run newspapers, the party's 48 million 
members were warned that they will be severely punished or expelled for 
"immoral behavior." This was broadly defined as including, among other things, 
the failure to support one's family members and to defend state property. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the guidelines are an indication that despite last week's 
decision to lift martial law in Beijing, there has been no letup in the 
crackdown after troops opened fire on the pro-democracy demonstrators last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was viewed as a key element in the party's campaign to improve 
its image. The pro-democracy movement gained wide popular support by calling 
attention to corruption in the party hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, who replaced the reformer Zhao Ziyang as party general secretary 
after the June crackdown, has warned corrupt officials that they will be 
expelled unless they mend their ways. The government has announced the 
execution of party officials found guilty of corruption in the past six months. 
A front-page editorial in Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party newspaper 
People's Daily said that party members "who have no good political quality, who 
trim their sails by chance . . . must be dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Premier Li Peng and a senior police official, Qiao Shi, who 
heads the party's discipline committee, were quoted by the New China News 
Agency as thanking the party's State Security Bureau for its "work on the 
secret battle front" and for "being willing unknown heroes." 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily emphasized that the anti-corruption drive has led to the 
closure of more than 1,600 state-run companies used by corrupt officials as 
private money-making machines. More than 1,000 others, it said, were shut down 
for similar violations as of last November. 
</P>
<P>
The closures will throw tens of thousands of people out of work, adding to a 
worsening unemployment problem. Western economic analysts estimate that as many 
as 30 million of China's 550 million laborers are out of work. Millions of them 
have left rural areas and crowded into cities. 
</P>
<P>
The new moral guidelines were also seen as an effort to ease bitterness among 
the poor against well-to-do party officials. China's austerity program, aimed 
at bringing down inflation, has widened the gap between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on lavish weddings and funerals, for example, clearly seemed to be a 
move to eliminate high-profile extravagance.

RIGHTIST HELD IN SHOOTING OF BLUNT NAGASAKI MAYOR

Police arrested a reputed leader of a right-wing extremist group Thursday in 
the shooting of Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, who had provoked 
nationalist ire and received numerous death threats after remarking 13 months 
ago that Emperor Hirohito was partly responsible for World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The man under arrest, Kazumi Tajiri, 40, confessed to firing a single pistol 
shot into Motoshima's back as he left the city hall a few hours earlier, a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tajiri was arrested in a local hotel and charged with attempted murder after 
fleeing the scene in a rental car, which the police found abandoned less than 
half a mile away. Tajiri had rented the car in his own name, which allowed the 
police to track him down, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Motoshima, 67, was reported in stable condition Thursday night at Nagasaki 
Public Hospital after undergoing two hours of surgery. The bullet bounced off a 
rib, pierced the left lung and narrowly missed the mayor's heart before 
emerging from his chest, surgeons were quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was decried by political leaders and social commentators as an act 
of terrorism. Some of them warned that free speech in Japan is under attack by 
the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
"Speech must be refuted only with speech," said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary 
general of the Japan Socialist Party, who was himself attacked, but not 
injured, by right-wing extremists while delivering a lecture last May. "The use 
of violence cannot be permitted." 
</P>
<P>
Tajiri was identified by police as a leader of Seiki Juku, a rightist 
organization of 31 members established in Nagasaki in 1981. A man answering the 
telephone at Seiki Juku's office Thursday night said the group had no comment 
on Tajiri's arrest or the attempt on Motoshima's life. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy erupted in December, 1988, after Motoshima addressed the question 
of the late Emperor Hirohito's wartime responsibility in remarks before the 
Nagasaki City Assembly on the 47th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl 
Harbor. Nagasaki was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, three 
days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Motoshima's comments broke a clear-cut taboo on criticizing Hirohito, who was 
then on his deathbed suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing groups denounced Motoshima. Japan's hard-core nationalists, many of 
whom allegedly have ties to organized crime, typically glorify the emperor and 
wear military-style uniforms. The groups, which number in the hundreds, are 
generally considered harmless, but violence occasionally erupts.

O.C. MUST CURB AUTOMATIC PROBE OF RELIEF APPLICANTS

Orange County social service workers will no longer be able to require 
automatic criminal investigations of some welfare applicants as a result of a 
court settlement Thursday in a lawsuit brought by advocates for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
In a practice believed to be unique to Orange County, applicants for General 
Relief welfare who are homeless and do not have proper identification have been 
automatically referred to a district attorney's investigator who routinely 
conducted a criminal background check. 
</P>
<P>
Under rules that will be effective in 30 days, welfare applicants will be 
referred to investigators only if there is a suspicion that they are attempting 
to commit fraud, according to Robert Newman, an attorney with the Western 
Center for Law and Poverty in Los Angeles, one of the firms representing the 
plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
"This settlement ends the county's illegal and inhumane policy of treating the 
homeless like suspected criminals," Newman said. "We are not forced to undergo 
a criminal investigation when we apply for a driver's license or enroll our 
children in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County has no reason to treat a homeless person any differently," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There were 3,997 General Relief cases referred to investigators in 1988, 
according to Robert Griffith, assistant director of the Orange County Social 
Services Agency. He said there is no estimate of how much the caseload might 
drop under the new rules but added: "We don't expect a dramatic reduction." 
</P>
<P>
The case just settled was filed in Orange County Superior Court in August, 
1988, on behalf of John Dombrink and his wife who withdrew their application 
for General Relief because they feared that investigators would arrest the 
husband on a $170 traffic warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant was eventually paid by Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa assistance 
group for the poor, and the couple then began receiving their welfare payment 
of more than $600 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling applies only to the General Relief program, which is intended 
for childless adults and is completely funded by county government. It is a 
program similar to the state-funded Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
There are no automatic criminal investigations of AFDC applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said he does not expect the ruling to have a significant effect on the 
county's welfare operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see this as a dramatic, startling change in the process," he said. 
"We are absolutely convinced that our fraud-prevention program will be as 
strong and effective as it has ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said the fraud-prevention system will maintain its integrity because 
it will still allow a welfare worker to call for an investigation if there is 
any suspicion of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"It's when the answer to one question doesn't make any sense compared to 
another answer," Griffith explained. "Our experienced workers get to have a 
pretty good ear for picking up stories."

VETO-OVERRIDE FIGHT ON FAMILY-PLANNING FUNDS TAKES SHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY BACK RESTORATION OF THE 
$20-MILLION CUT BY THE GOVERNOR. 
</P>

<P>
Setting the stage for a possible veto override, the Assembly on Thursday 
overwhelmingly approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to restore 
$20 million in family-planning funds that he struck down last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan 65-8 vote on the controversial issue follows a similarly 
lopsided vote in the Senate. If the governor vetoes the bill to restore funds 
to California's 500 clinics for poor women, proponents promise a vigorous 
campaign to bring the issue to an override vote in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been our strategy for the last six months," said Barbara Jackson, 
director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino 
counties. "When it was clear the governor was not approachable or reasonable, 
we knew we had to rely on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is hope the governor realizes how widespread support for family 
planning is, and it would be futile for him to veto this legislation," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson noted that three of the eight dissenters were Orange County 
representatives: Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach), John Lewis (R-Orange) 
and Dennis Brown (R-Signal Hill). "Unfortunately, these three men still haven't 
gotten the message that family planning is good for the people of California 
and good for the longevity of officeholders," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
A gubernatorial veto override requires a two-thirds majority of both houses -- 
or 54 votes in the Assembly and 27 in the Senate. A successful override would 
be the first of a Deukmejian veto in his two terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
As the financial pinch on the clinics serving 500,000 women statewide 
continues, the issue is a longstanding point of contention between Deukmejian 
and legislators -- growing in number -- who favor restoration of the funds. 
Deukmejian's cut of clinic funds from $36 million to $12 million has also been 
successfully challenged in lower courts and is now before the state Supreme 
Court -- a development that has especially rankled the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has criticized the Legislature for trying to rush the bill that 
would restore the $20 million to the program, under which women receive 
treatment, screening, and advice on health and reproductive matters including 
family planning. The governor has wanted the Legislature to wait until the 
issue has been resolved by the courts. He has complained that the court ruling 
"goes to the issue" of a governor's constitutional powers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), chairman of the Health Committee 
and author of the restoration bill, indicated that there is scant sentiment for 
further delays. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a stronger vote than anyone would have imagined when we came in 
here this morning," Bronzan said. " . . . I think it would be hard for the 
governor not to recognize the strong feelings on the part of the Republicans. I 
think he will find a way to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he thinks he already has the necessary votes to override in the 
Senate -- where the vote for restoring clinic funds was 30 to 5 on Tuesday -- 
and is only "two or three votes away" in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A press spokesman for Deukmejian, Tom Beermann, declined to say what Deukmejian 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor will review the bill and take action based on the merits," 
Beermann said. "At this point, an override is not a consideration" influencing 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has 12 days in which to sign, veto or allow the bill to become law 
without his signature. The earliest he could receive it would be today. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, casting a vote to pass a bill and casting a vote to override a 
veto are two vastly different actions. A vote to override is especially 
difficult for members of the governor's own political party. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, a solid Assembly GOP bloc has made Deukmejian immune from being 
overridden, but Thursday's vote on the family-planning issue -- with 22 
affirmative Republican votes -- indicated that the bloc could be cracking. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, some vote counters privately indicated that if the governor 
vetoes the bill, the action probably would be overridden, provided that the 
Democrats stick together and enough Republicans break away from their lame-duck 
party leader on an issue that they believe is very popular with constituents. 
Senate Republicans generally are more independent than their Assembly 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly GOP floor leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who did not vote on the 
measure, said: "George Deukmejian has never been overridden, and I do not 
expect he will be overridden on this bill. We will continue to negotiate in 
good faith on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson conceded that the size of the bipartisan vote was a "clear message 
that a great many Republicans support the idea of family planning and are 
satisfied with the language of this bill." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he abstained from voting on the legislation, Johnson said he was 
"torn" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Bronzan said: "This is an issue that won't go away. It 
gets worse. Thirty-seven clinics have closed their doors. One-half-million 
women in California are served by this program. 
</P>
<P>
"If these funds aren't restored, there will be an additional 56,000 unwanted 
pregnancies and 22,000 of these will terminate in abortions." 
</P>
<P>
He said the bill guarantees that no family-planning funds would go for 
abortions or abortion services. 
</P>
<P>
But an opponent, Assemblyman Philip Wyman (R-Tehachapi), charged that the 
"so-called restrictions on abortions are a factual sham." 
</P>
<P>
Another foe, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle, joined Deukmejian in arguing that the 
vote should be delayed until after the courts act on the lawsuit filed by 
opponents of the governor's family-planning funds cutback. 
</P>
<P>
A lower court judge ordered Deukmejian to restore the money last December, but 
appeals by the state held up release of the funds. The Supreme Court has yet to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the roll-call vote by which the Assembly voted 65 to 8 to restore 
family-planning funds vetoed by the governor from the state budget:

DIANNE KLEIN: WHOOPS OVER HOOPS PIT NEIGHBOR AGAINST NEIGHBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein

<TEXT>
<P>
No sense in naming names, at least not any real ones. Everybody knows who 
everybody else is anyway, if not by face, than certainly by address. The whole 
neighborhood's divided by factions. No sense in fanning the flames here. 
</P>
<P>
It's basketball hoops we're talking about. For or against. 
</P>
<P>
Now in this neighborhood, which at least by aesthetic standards is very nice, 
not far from the ocean, there is no law per se against basketball hoops. But it 
is understood. The board of the homeowners' association has been dead-set 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball hoops, the understanding goes, are for other neighborhoods, ones 
with RVs parked in the streets, screens on the front doors and awnings made of 
aluminum, with stripes on them. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find none of that in this tract, which has a fancy-sounding name and a 
tasteful stone marker out on the main street letting everybody know what to 
expect inside. 
</P>
<P>
The houses here, 192 of them, are tidy, well maintained, some of them more so 
than others, but then you've got to take in consideration that some of them 
house children. Others do not. 
</P>
<P>
That's more or less how the line, over basketball hoops, has been drawn. You 
either have them -- children -- or you don't. You either want them -- 
basketball hoops -- or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
But about four months ago, some residents of this tract began storming the 
line. Petitions were signed and doors were slammed in faces and words were said 
not so much behind people's backs but straight to their faces. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was to be expected when you comprehend that the stink over the 
right to shoot hoops on one's own property had been building for a good while 
before that. There have been incidents, fines and grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball hoops have a way of doing this, you understand. They get under 
homeowners' skin, roiling dissent in otherwise-bucolic scenes of Orange County 
Americana. 
</P>
<P>
There's a neighborhood in Newport Beach that spent eight years and tens of 
thousands of dollars fighting to banish a hoop from above one family's garage. 
But that's a whole other story . . . 
</P>
<P>
So anyway, the basketball brouhaha in this particular neighborhood was building 
to a crescendo when I went to visit Patty Riley (remember what I said about 
real names), a mother of two and wife of one. 
</P>
<P>
This was the big night. Basketball hoops were on the agenda at the homeowners' 
association meeting. 
</P>
<P>
We were sitting at the dining room table, and Patty had just explained to me 
about her mission -- to allow residents to erect free-standing hoops in their 
driveways -- and all the trouble that it had caused her and Bobbie Knight, 
another concerned mother and fellow rabble-rousing neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"My son wanted a basketball court for his birthday," Patty said. "He doesn't 
want to sit inside and play Nintendo all afternoon. They see the Lakers. They 
have their dreams. They want to do what they do. Here, in his own neighborhood, 
he can't." 
</P>
<P>
(Just then, the phone rang. It was for Patty's son. His school basketball coach 
was calling.) 
</P>
<P>
Next, Patty showed me the color-coded tract map, which stands as a testament to 
the mothers' diligence. The Browns -- 145 houses -- have signed their petition 
directing the homeowners' association board to allow detached and temporary 
basketball hoops. The remaining 47 homes are either Pinks -- die-hard hoop foes 
-- or Greens, unavailable renters. 
</P>
<P>
Patty tucked the map into her folder, along with the petition and her speech 
written on index cards, and we piled into the minivan and headed for the 
meeting at the home of an association board member -- needless to say, a Pink. 
</P>
<P>
Patty's next-door neighbor, a retiree who would love to allow his grandchildren 
to shoot hoops at his house, joined us. 
</P>
<P>
But when we arrived at Mr. Pink's house, Bobbie Knight and her husband were 
waiting outside, clutching poster boards pasted with snapshots of neighborhoods 
even more upscale than their own where basketball hoops flourish. The snapshots 
were to be used to illustrate the hoop presentation, but the homeowners' 
association board had postponed tonight's meeting without notice. 
</P>
<P>
"That figures," Patty said. "They probably did this on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Sensing a good story, one that defines the very essence of life in suburbia -- 
not to mention the fact that when thrown into a homeowners' association, most 
people will discover that they really can't stand each other -- I returned the 
following night. 
</P>
<P>
Patty was there with her petition. Bobbie had the charts. About 20 homeowners 
were gathered in Mr. Pink's living room. 
</P>
<P>
After a discussion about one neighbor's cement addition to his driveway (board 
member: "It looks like crap"; homeowner: "You're crap"), we moved on to the 
hoops. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie took the lead. She was smiling, her voice sugary. She passed around the 
poster boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I say it's time to change," she said. "Not allowing basketball hoops is 
mean-spirited and ill conceived. This was probably started by some yuppie who 
ironed his socks years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Hey now, wait a minute. One of the Pink board members told a little story about 
someone he knows who had a basketball hoop next door. Some kid was playing with 
it and the ball dented his friend's BMW. 
</P>
<P>
There was more, from the Browns and the Pinks, but the pro-hoop faction seemed 
to have the edge. Certainly they had more players on their team. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the sugar in Bobbie's voice was beginning to melt. She was 
getting ready to slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's ridiculous and petty that we can't have them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then one of the representatives of the association's management company asked 
that the petitions be turned over. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie and Patty looked at each other, then said no. Some Browns had 
specifically mentioned their fear of retribution from the board, where the 
Pinks are believed to hold a 4-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers suggested that the board members vote on the hoop issue, keeping in 
mind that almost 78% of the homeowners are willing to live with hoops in their 
midst. If the board's answer is still no, then the petition will be presented 
to bolster an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Well, all right, the board finally agreed. The members would take the mothers' 
motion under consideration and get back to them, by letter, of course. No sense 
rushing into this. 
</P>
<P>
This was about where I made my exit. The homeowner with the cement driveway 
addition had taken the floor again. 
</P>
<P>
(Homeowner: "So help me, if you hold up escrow on my house because of this 
little piece of concrete. . . ." Board member: "It's a large piece of 
concrete.") 
</P>
<P>
I'll get back to you on the hoops.

7 ARRESTED AFTER 95-M.P.H. CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities chased a carload of illegal immigrants at speeds of 95 m.p.h. 
Thursday from San Clemente to Westminster, then treated them to hamburgers and 
fries after they were captured. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started about 11:40 a.m. at the San Onofre immigration checkpoint, 
five miles south of San Clemente. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
agents spotted a red 1976 Camaro with only two passengers that seemed to be 
heavily weighted down, California Highway Patrol Officer Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
As the car passed through the checkpoint, agents ran a computer check of the 
license plate and discovered that the car had been stolen. When agents followed 
and tried to stop the car, it sped northbound on Interstate 5, then switched to 
the San Diego Freeway north of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the car pulled off the freeway at Westminster Boulevard 
and the driver jumped from the vehicle and ran. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old was quickly captured. There turned out to be six passengers in 
the car, including one in the trunk. Upon questioning, authorities discovered 
that the five men and two women were illegal aliens from various parts of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were very hungry and hadn't eaten for at least a day, so our 
officers took them to In-N-Out (Burgers) for lunch," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the chase, but the episode underscored growing concern 
among South County officials -- particularly in San Clemente -- about 
high-speed pursuits originating at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente City Council this week adopted a resolution urging state and 
federal officials to build a new checkpoint on I-5 closer to Oceanside. San 
Clemente officials want a $30-million, 16-lane checkpoint built at Las Pulgas 
Road, about 12 miles south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Border Patrol chases through the city limits have posed grave hazards to the 
safety of our citizens and visitors, which is unacceptable to the city," the 
resolution said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials said they would seek support from neighboring cities in 
their relocation effort. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, three pursuits of suspected illegal aliens have ended in San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials met Wednesday with Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) to 
discuss, among other things, the possibility of financing a new checkpoint with 
money allocated to fight international drug trafficking, said Assistant City 
Manager Gregory L. Hulsizer. But Packard reportedly gave no indication that 
such money was available. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize the need of the Border Patrol to do its job and the role it plays 
in immigration and the war on drugs," Hulsizer said. "But at the same time, we 
share a concern with the safety of the people on our streets." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's chase did not spill onto San Clemente streets, but it did tie up 
traffic on the San Diego Freeway when officers shut down all four northbound 
lanes in Westminster after the stolen vehicle slowed down and the driver jumped 
out. A CHP officer then rammed the car, preventing it from rolling back onto 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The six passengers in the stolen car were being returned to Mexico. The driver 
was booked at Orange County Juvenile Hall for possession of a stolen vehicle, 
failure to yield to an emergency vehicle, driving without a driver's license 
and not wearing a seat belt, Whitten said. MATT LAIT and WENDY PAULSON

$2.3 MILLION TO GO TO KATELLA AVENUE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Katella Avenue will receive $2.3 million worth of improvements this year, 
including a traffic signal coordination project, new storm drains and the 
widening of a busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The city has received a $1.6-million grant to coordinate traffic signals on 
Katella Avenue from the San Gabriel River Freeway to the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The grant was made by the Orange County Transportation Commission, which is 
funding projects to improve traffic on regionally significant streets such as 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
A $368,000 storm drain also will be installed on Katella from State College 
Boulevard to Lewis Street as part of a Board of Supervisors plan to improve 
arterial roads. And the county will be paying for a widening of the 
intersection of Katella and State College to improve traffic. The widening will 
cost $366,000.

COUNCIL PUTS FREEZE ON BUILDING PERMITS

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about a serious water shortage, the City Council imposed an immediate 
90-day freeze on new building permits. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the freeze would give the city time to determine how projects 
already under way will affect water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
This in turn will help the city determine what new projects can be allowed 
without putting too great a strain on the water supply, said Community 
Development Director James Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to figure out how to phase development so that it doesn't get ahead of 
water improvements," Holloway said. "The balance issue is very crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Under the emergency ordinance, people can still apply for building and 
construction permits, but they will not be issued until the 90-day ban expires. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff will return to the council at the end of three months with a 
plan on how development permits should be allocated in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also gives the council authority to stop all new construction in 
the event of a city-mandated water emergency. It does not apply to projects 
already under construction. Also exempted are building additions and 
improvements that would increase water usage by less than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Because rapid growth has overwhelmed the city's aging water delivery system, 
officials are concerned that new developments over the next two years could 
outstrip existing water supplies for the growing seaside community of 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Relief is expected in mid-1991, when a larger imported water pipe under 
construction from El Toro to San Clemente is expected to be complete. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, officials fear a repeat of a severe water shortage that occurred 
unexpectedly last summer, when the city's main reservoir at the Tri-Cities 
Water District dropped from 34 million gallons to 17 million gallons between 
June and August. WENDY PAULSON

CITY COUNCIL BACKS STREET REALIGNMENT

<P>
In a decision that angered several Brea residents, the City Council unanimously 
supported a developers' proposal to realign Randolph Avenue near Brea 
Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are upset because a proposed retail center on the former Brea-Olinda 
High School site will require changes they say will create traffic problems on 
the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, motorists driving south on Randolph will be prohibited from 
turning left onto Birch Street. A concrete median will be built along Birch as 
part of the overall plan for development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to realigning Randolph, new traffic signals will be installed along 
Birch at Poplar Avenue, one block west of Randolph, and at the entrance to the 
planned shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe Development Co. is expanding its Brea Marketplace at the Randolph Avenue 
and Birch Street intersection. Initially, the firm proposed a 
300,000-square-foot office building on the school site. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that residents living north of the development who want to make a 
left turn on Birch Street will be able to do so at Poplar Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say they fear there will be accidents caused by motorists who use 
Poplar Avenue to get to the new signal. Poplar, they say, has more curves and 
blind intersections than Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
"It's less safe. It's unbelievable that they let this go through," resident Don 
McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, six residents complained about the realignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic will be impacted in our residential area by the proposal," said Tim 
Scott. "It would increase traffic in our neighborhood by 30%." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Frank Benest said installing a traffic light and a left-turn lane 
at the Poplar and Birch intersection will ease traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the realignment will affect about 300 homes. Jennifer Moulton

<P>
City Council has approved a three-year contract with the Tustin Municipal 
Employees Assn., which represents about 130 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a minimum pay increase of 5% retroactive to Jan. 1, a 
1% increase effective July 1 and further increases in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The union, which represents non-management general employees including 
secretaries, clerks, custodians and tree trimmers, has already approved the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
A contract for the 52 employees represented by the Tustin Police Officers Assn. 
is still being negotiated, City Manager William A. Huston said. The contract 
expired Jan. 1. Negotiating teams are expected to meet again in the next few 
days, Huston said.

COALITION TO CONFRONT SHELDON IN WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
HOMOSEXUALITY: GROUPS PLAN TO PROTEST EVANGELIST'S CONFERENCE THAT SEEKS A 
NATIONAL STRATEGY AGAINST SPECIAL RIGHTS FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of national civil rights groups is planning a public showdown next 
week with the Rev. Louis Sheldon, the Orange County evangelist whose 
Traditional Values Coalition is waging a highly publicized battle against 
homosexual rights. 
</P>
<P>
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Organization for 
Women, among other groups, are planning a march, rally and press conference in 
Washington next Friday to denounce Sheldon's "ideology of bigotry and 
intolerance," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Louis Sheldon is coming to town, but we're going to be ready for him," said 
Robert Bray, the task force's director of public information. 
</P>
<P>
The object of the protest is the Sheldon-organized "National Summit on 
Homosexuality: Healing and Public Policy Implications," an all-day meeting next 
Friday at the Sheraton-Washington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Among the scheduled speakers are Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), a 
longtime foe of the homosexual rights movement, and William B. Allen, former 
chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. At a Sheldon conference in 
Anaheim last October, Allen, then-chairman of the commission, delivered a 
controversial speech entitled: "Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a 
Minority?" 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Washington gathering, Sheldon said Thursday, is to plan a 
national strategy for countering the position that homosexuality is normal and 
should be protected with special civil rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said about 50 to 75 "clinical people, public-policy people and . . . 
recovering homosexual people" will attend the summit to hear a half-dozen 
speakers and panelists. Sheldon said he could not identify those attending 
because of concerns about reprisals for their participation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon and his associates dispute the view that homosexuality is a genetically 
determined trait. They promote the use of "reparative therapy" to "heal" 
homosexuals and return them to a heterosexual life style. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our intention to inflame hatred or condemnation, because homosexuals 
have received too much of that already," Sheldon said. "Our purpose is to do 
three things: to shed light, to stimulate clear thinking and to facilitate 
reasoned thought and conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bray said he believes Sheldon's intentions are less sanguine. "What is 
unique about Sheldon's group is that in the past, Moral Majority types 
manifested their hatred toward us and didn't try to put it behind a smiley 
face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bray and Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund said they believe the 
Washington meeting is significant because it fuels speculation that Sheldon is 
intent on attracting a national audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Coalition for Traditional Values . . . (and related 
groups) are poised to make a bid for national attention," Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the vacuum created by the suspension of the Moral Majority, and (the 
Rev.) Jerry Falwell stepping out of the national political scene, we think that 
Louis Sheldon, in particular . . . will step in," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As traditional conservatives become less worried about the threat of world 
communism because of the changes in Eastern Europe, groups such as Sheldon's 
are attempting to focus conservative fears on homosexuality, Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the new bogyman," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's spokesman, Paul Mero, countered: "They just flatter themselves. 
They're not the bogyman they think they are. We've got other things to do and 
this is just one of many." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Sheldon protesters plan to rally at DuPont Circle in downtown Washington 
at 6 p.m. next Friday. A march to the Sheraton-Washington will follow. A press 
conference is also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other groups sponsoring the protest, Bray said, are the Human Rights 
Campaign Fund, the American Psychological Assn., the Washington Interreligious 
Staff Council, People for the American Way, the Gay and Lesbian Activist 
Alliance and Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.

LAW SCHOOL MAY EXPAND TO IRVINE 
</P>

<P>
Western State University College of Law is making plans to open a satellite 
campus here in hopes of becoming the first established law school in the 
burgeoning South County area, its president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Western State, already the largest law school in California, hopes to have as 
many as 200 students in Irvine by the 1990 fall semester, with the possibility 
of expanding to 1,000 students within four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion is aimed at both attracting new students and accommodating the 
current ones, President Jack Monks said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that 70% of his students are part time, Monks said: "Our students are 
spending a huge amount of time on the road, unproductive and frustrating time . 
. . trying to sandwich in their legal education" between family and 
professional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The school, with campuses in Fullerton and San Diego, does not have 
accreditation from the American Bar Assn. but is seen as a "second chance" for 
some older and non-traditional students. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at UC Irvine have been considering opening a law school and are 
expected to make a recommendation this spring. UCI spokeswoman Colleen 
Bentley-Adler said those officials seem to be leaning in favor of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But both she and Western State officials asserted that they see little conflict 
between the two schools because they would appeal to different students. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not a threat," Bentley-Adler said. "If anything, we might be 
considered a threat to them if we opened a law school because a public school 
would be less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Western State settled on Irvine for the new campus after faculty members polled 
their students informally and the city emerged as their top choice, Monks said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that area isn't the center of the universe yet, it's destined to become 
that, and we want to be there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Western State, one of the few large, for-profit law schools in the country, is 
currently looking at three unspecified sites for its Irvine campus, Monks said. 
He estimated the start-up cost in the first few years could be about $6 million 
to $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
South County has had some small, unaccredited and short-lived law schools in 
its history, Monks and other Western State officials said, but never a 
well-established university. 
</P>
<P>
Western State's Fullerton campus has 1,300 students and the San Diego campus 
has about 500. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all full in Fullerton," Monks said. "Applications and admissions are up, 
and we're not very anxious to try and jam people into the closet and see if we 
can make the walls stretch." 
</P>
<P>
The school generally relies on attracting older students, many of whom are 
considering career switches and who may not have the time or the grades to go 
to a full-time law school with ABA accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Western State fought to gain ABA accreditation, but school officials 
have now given up that quest, deciding instead to concentrate on the school's 
original mission of appealing to a different type of student. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of accreditation could hurt the school as it attempts to make a name for 
itself in South County, according to some in the local legal establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather see an ABA-accredited school down in South County," said 
one leading local attorney who requested anonymity. "The market will have to 
establish whether we need another Western State in that area." 
</P>
<P>
But Jennifer King, new president of the Orange County Bar Assn., said she 
expects her organization to welcome the Western State expansion. 
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that South County could support an ABA school, she added: "I 
think they can both exist. . . . There's a need for a convenient school like 
Western State, and I know a lot of very good lawyers who have gone there."

DOCTOR FILES SEIZED IN STEROID PROBE

State and local law enforcement agents Thursday raided two offices of a 
physician who, they say, is under investigation for illegal prescription of 
anabolic steroids for bodybuilders. 
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed against Dr. George Steven Kooshian, but the agents seized 
the medical records to try to corroborate information that the doctor has been 
prescribing the illegal drug for at least one year, according to J. D. Miles, 
special agent in charge of the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Miles said 16 agents from his agency, the Medical Board of California, the 
state Department of Justice's medical fraud branch and Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office raided the doctor's offices at 9:30 a.m. and spent 
the entire day examining records. Miles would not say why the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office was involved, and investigators from that 
office were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Miles said the seized records will be reviewed and presented to the Orange 
County district attorney's office for possible felony charges of prescription 
of anabolic steroids without medical cause. 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids are synthetic hormones sold as pills or injectable liquids to 
add muscle mass. They were outlawed for non-medical use in California two years 
ago after dangerous side-effects began surfacing. The steroids can be 
administered legally for medicinal purposes, including repair of atrophied or 
torn muscles, but they cannot be sold for such purposes as bodybuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Kooshian, 39, a general practitioner who was on his regularly scheduled day off 
Thursday, said he was not aware of the raids and declined further comment. 
Miles, however, said the physician had been notified of the action by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Miles said the investigation into Kooshian's practice is part of a larger probe 
of illegal steroid prescriptions in the Orange County area. He declined to give 
specifics on the other cases. 
</P>
<P>
The Kooshian investigation began in November, 1988, after state officials 
received a tip that the physician was dispensing anabolic steroids to 
bodybuilders from his two offices in Garden Grove, Miles said. One office is in 
the 12600 block of Garden Grove Boulevard and the other is in the 12000 block 
of Valley View Street. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other criminal cases in which a search warrant is served at the time of 
arrest, Miles said criminal charges involving a medical practice generally are 
not filed until after search warrant is served to seize a doctor's medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Miles explained that the records are necessary in order to verify information 
from former patients and other informants that the doctor was, in fact, 
dispensing drugs illegally. Miles said the agents were looking, specifically, 
for records pertaining to any bodybuilders on Kooshian's patient list. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some prior information that is the basis of the warrants," Miles said, 
declining to elaborate on the sources of that information. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being coordinated jointly by the state narcotics bureau 
and the state medical board, which supervises California's physicians.

Oh, the intangibles of athletic performance. Who knows why a basketball 
player's game goes up a level? It could be that the athlete has grown more 
confident, gotten healthier or switched from Twinkies to Ding Dongs. 
</P>
<P>
In Karie Yoshioka's case, it's a bit of all three, though granted, the switch 
from Twinkies to Ding Dongs and her emergence this season as one of Orange 
County's top point guards could be coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka, a senior, is one of the reasons El Toro High School is 15-5 overall, 
4-1 in the South Coast League and ranked second in the county behind national 
power Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka has been El Toro's floor leader this season. She led the county in 
assists (7.7 per game) and was averaging 16.2 points and 4.1 steals after 18 
games. She has been one of the county's most accurate shooters, hitting 50% 
from three-point range and 58.2% overall. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches compare her with Brea-Olinda senior Aimee McDaniel, the consensus 
premier point guard in the county, a high school All-American and The Times' 
player of the year as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad company, especially considering Yoshioka is only 5-feet-3, 110 pounds; 
she missed a great deal of her junior season with injury and illness, and she 
didn't even play organized basketball until her freshman year at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she can do everything Aimee does," El Toro Coach Greg Yeck said. "What 
Aimee has over Karie is experience. Aimee had experience at an earlier level 
and has been in big ballgames and in the big program where they have been 
playing the best." 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh wouldn't trade McDaniel for Yoshioka, but he said 
Yoshioka is in the same class with McDaniel and her backcourt mate, Tammy 
Blackburn. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't realize that Karie Yoshioka is a Division I college player," 
Yeck said. "I've got a kid here who can set up and knock down the three-pointer 
and knock it down as well as anybody. Her vision is phenomenal as far as seeing 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka is not nearly as well known as either of the Brea-Olinda guards partly 
because El Toro's program is not as prominent, because she was injured her 
junior year and because, until recently, she did not assert herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Karie was a slow build," Yeck said. "To tell the truth, I don't think Karie 
really believed in her abilities until this year. She had a little voice inside 
that kept saying you're good, but not that good and it was holding her back." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka realized part of her responsibility this season is to help Sara Bone 
(18 points a game) with the scoring load. Still, Yeck has to persuade Yoshioka 
to shoot more, especially three-point shots. She didn't shoot any as a 
sophomore, but this season she was 21 of 42 through 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka prefers to drive and set up her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not the kind of person who just comes up and shoots the three because I 
have other shots I would rather shoot," Yoshioka said. "That is not one of my 
main shots. I like the drives, drive to the jump shot. I think I have such a 
high percentage because of my shot selection. If there is somebody right there, 
I won't shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Yeck said he has always believed in Yoshioka's ability. Others had only her 
injury-plagued patchwork junior year to judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody we have played (this season), their attitude has been, 'Where did 
she come from? I vaguely remember her being a good point guard before but not 
this good,' " Yeck said. "They think some miracle thing happened over the 
summer, but she just got healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka injured an ankle by colliding with another player in the last summer 
league game before the start of her junior season. She re-sprained the ankle in 
the first game of the season and had to have her ankle immobilized in a heavy 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated last year," Yoshioka said. "It was so frustrating. I would sit on the 
sidelines and I wanted to to go on the court and all, but I could only cheer." 
</P>
<P>
She missed the first two weeks of play before returning at 3/4 speed. She was 
just getting back to normal when she got the flu and was out of action until 
midway through the first half of South Coast League play. 
</P>
<P>
Without Yoshioka, the Chargers had trouble handling the ball. They finished 
18-10 and 9-1, losing the league title to Mission Viejo. She averaged 10.2 
points and 5.6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka played junior varsity as a freshman. Her sophomore season, Yeck 
promoted her to the varsity bench seven games into the season. She began 
outperforming the varsity guards and worked her way into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshioka recalls being terrified to be in the company of her idols -- Andrea 
Young (now playing at Rice) and Elaine Youngs (playing basketball and 
volleyball for UCLA). The team was ranked No. 1 in the county preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was by far my best team, the greatest team we ever had," Yeck said. "Still 
it is a year that makes me sick to my stomach when I think what could have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
Young and Youngs were sidelined almost the entire season with injury. El Toro 
finished 24-6 overall and 7-3 in the league, good enough for third place, and 
advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can look back on that season and feel really good about it is 
it meant that Sara Bone and Yoshioka had to come in and start as sophomores," 
Yeck said. "And now look where we are. In the long run we have to look at the 
good that came out of their having to be put on the floor in a crash course. 
They are now two of the better players in the county." 
</P>
<P>
After the disappointments of her sophomore and junior seasons, Yoshioka decided 
that things would be different her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"This season I was chosen as captain with (seniors) Sara Bone and Danielle 
Silva, and we decided this is our last chance and we don't want to ruin it by 
having any problems interfere," Yoshioka said. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I was making sure, because last year was a total bummer for me." 
</P>
<P>
Making sure means getting her ankles taped, among other things. "It is just the 
motherly things, like I make sure and take a jacket and everything and don't 
get cold and watch what I eat. I make sure I don't eat as much junk food. 
Twinkies were my trademark. I love Twinkies. I haven't had one in quite a long 
time. Since summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't eat them as much. I used to eat Twinkies before the game 
sometimes. It was a sugar high. But, after the team gave me a box of Twinkies 
at the end of the season and I ate the whole box, I decided to go for the Ding 
Dongs, but not as much." 
</P>
<P>
The extra care and attention and Ding Dongs have paid off.

EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
TITUS HELPS LOARA BEAT LOS ALAMITOS, KEEP HOPES ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loara High School made it look pretty easy for the first quarter Thursday night 
against Los Alamitos. But the Saxons made it look awfully tough the rest of the 
way before finally keeping at least their statistical shot at an Empire League 
girls' basketball title alive with a 59-51 victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
Loara is 9-10 overall and 2-3 in league play. Los Alamitos drops to 4-13, 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams, currently in the bottom half of the league standings, feature 
the county's top young centers in Loara junior Traci Titus and Los Alamitos 
sophomore Allison Arredondo. 
</P>
<P>
Titus used her quickness and experience to get the better of their match-up 
Thursday. She was seven of 12 shooting for 15 points and had eight rebounds and 
four blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
It was Titus' quickness on defense and her more-experienced supporting cast 
that helped turn the game in Loara's favor. Los Alamitos starts no seniors. 
Titus continually picked off or deflected post passes to Arredondo to finish 
with eight steals. She limited Arredondo to three first-half points, but 
Arredondo is not the county's second leading scorer (at 25 points per game) for 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
She used her own exceptional mobility and agility to score 19 second-half 
points and finish with 23. Many of her points came when Titus was out of the 
lineup with foul trouble or for a rest. But Titus was able to score over 
Arredondo. 
</P>
<P>
"She was tough," Arredondo said of Titus. "When you play somebody as good as 
you are or better than you, you're going to get better. I'm not deathly afraid 
of anybody. I accept the challenge and I want the challenge because I know I'll 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
Loara opened up a 15-0 lead, holding Los Alamitos scoreless for the first 10 
minutes before Cindy Yamasaki hit one of her four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Loara led by as much as 20-3 late in the second quarter, and the game began to 
look like a blowout until Los Alamitos went on a 12-1 run to trail 21-15 at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"We make games close," Loara Coach Gary Blate said. "We turned over the ball 
too many times and the three-point shot, that will get you back in a game." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' Yamasaki sisters, Cindy and Tritia, accounted for seven of the 12 
points in the run. Cindy Yamasaki's three-pointer with about four minutes to 
play in the third quarter cut the lead to 25-21, but that was as close as Los 
Alamitos would get. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Leonard got hot from outside for the Saxons, along with Kristen 
Thibodeau, who scored 13 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a great second half, but we are a young, inexperienced team and 
things like this will happen," Los Alamitos Coach Al Gragnano said. 
</P>
<P>
One bright spot for Los Alamitos was freshman Cindy Yamasaki. In her second 
game back after fracturing her wrist in late December, she had 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other Empire League games: 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 50, Katella 31 -- Jennifer Harney, Kim Kordik and Andrea Warmus 
combined for 44 points to lead Esperanza (14-3, 5-0) at Esperanza. Harney had 
17, including three three-pointers, and Kordik had 16 with 12 rebounds. Warmus 
added 11 points, 10 coming in the final quarter when Esperanza outscored 
Katella, 22-6, to break open a close game. Karen Jensen had 14 points for 
Katella, which trailed, 28-25, at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 66, El Dorado 54 -- Stacie Kosaka had 23 points and Sheryl Murakoshi 22 
to lead Cypress (11-8, 4-1) in a game at El Dorado. Frances Oda had seven 
assists and six steals for Cypress.

By BOB BORSUM Sonora 54, Troy 35 -- Chris Kiel had 15 points, Casie Lozano 13

<P>
La Habra High School's "freak" defense in the second half and Leslie Ferguson's 
27 points and 14 rebounds led the Highlanders over Fullerton, 58-40, in a 
Freeway League girls' basketball game Thursday night at Fullerton High. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson scored 12 of La Habra's 20 points in the third quarter and its defense 
controlled the boards, forcing Fullerton (11-5 overall, 4-1 in league play) 
into poor shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We put our freak defense, designed to take two shooters (Fullerton's Summer 
McLane and Jennifer Comstock) out of the game while increasing our intensity . 
. . in the second quarter," La Habra Coach John Koehler said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, our defense forced the ball into the hands of Fullerton's 
nonshooters and contained them to only one shot, and our rebounders were in 
position to sweep the boards." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra led only 22-18 at halftime, but Fullerton lost momentum when Lynn 
Gilbert, its inside shooter, injured her right ankle with 7:43 to play in half. 
Gilbert injured the same ankle last year and was out for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (13-2, 4-0) had 47 rebounds. Zrinka Kristich had 15 rebounds and 12 
points and Ana Kristrich had 12 rebounds and 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Vernie Ford called her team's poor shooting (15 of 54) 
"discouraging, an age-old problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
"We played hard and made good adjustments, but our shooting just wasn't on 
target," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
McLane hit six of 15 shots from the field (15 points), and Comstock hit six of 
17, one a three-pointer (13 points). 
</P>
<P>
Koehler said the score is not indicative of the game. "We made mistakes in the 
first half and Fullerton got after us," he said. BOB BORSUM Sonora 54, Troy 35 
-- Chris Kiel had 15 points, Casie Lozano 13 and Denise Donadio 12 to lead host 
Sonora (4-10, 1-3). Brandy Richardson had 22 points for Troy. Sonora trailed, 
15-3, in the first quarter, but came back with a press and took the lead, 
33-31, in the fourth quarter. Sonora made 14 of 18 free throws in the fourth 
quarter and outscored Troy, 40-14, in the second half. Buena Park 55, Sunny 
Hills 30 -- Three girls scored in double figures to lead host Buena Park. 
Melissa Massinsin had 13 points for the winners. Gina Bongiovanni had 11 and 
Daniele Fagins added 10.

Rashone Lewis, Fullerton College's leading scorer and rebounder, said Thursday 
he will enroll next fall at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 6-foot-6 forward from Verbum Dei High School and Cal State Fullerton, 
will be eligible to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
He has two years of eligibility left. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis played sparingly last season at Cal State Fullerton and left because he 
thought he should have played more. He transferred to Fullerton College last 
fall and is averaging 20.5 points and nine rebounds a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis will play for Paul Landreaux, who is in his first year as coach at St. 
Mary's. Landreaux was an assistant at UCLA last season and before that the head 
coach at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to play for a good program," Lewis said. "Coach Landreaux has 
the program going in the right direction, and I feel like I can play there."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS: WHY RETURNABLE CARS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the view of many consumers, a car, like other goods, should be returnable. 
It's a big purchase, full of details and fraught with uncertainty, sometimes 
including problems on delivery and seemingly endless "adjustments" thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, car makers have responded. Chrysler, Pontiac and Oldsmobile have 
recently made it possible to return some of their cars at least some of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
But a customer service that should have been greeted with cheers has barely 
been noted. Perhaps it's not what consumers want, or it wasn't offered right, 
or perhaps nobody, consumers included, really understands what sells cars. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler started with limited tests in individual cities half a dozen years 
ago. Then, for several months in the fall of 1988, Chrysler buyers in 
Washington were offered their money back on cars returned within 30 days or 
1,000 miles, while buyers in Denver and Chicago could exchange them for another 
car, for any reason, as long as the car hadn't sustained more than $300 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
That same fall, General Motors' Pontiac division, having tested a similar 
program in California with its Grand Am model, offered nationwide to exchange 
any 1989 Grand Prix within 30 days or 3,000 miles. And last September, GM's 
Oldsmobile division introduced the "Oldsmobile Edge," a "customer satisfaction 
program" including, among other benefits, the right to exchange any new Olds 
within the first 1,500 miles or 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Such programs convey the message that "we stand behind the product," says Mike 
Losh, Oldsmobile's general manager and GM vice president. "Our products are 
better than five years ago, and this is a very graphic way of telling people." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a message these manufacturers thought consumers would welcome. 
Pontiac's market research, for example, indicated that more than 85% of 
households would be more likely to consider a car with that guarantee than one 
with other "inducements," such as rebates and low financing. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, no one seems sure whether the programs were successes or failures, 
or how to interpret the results. Actual returns were few -- less than 1% of 
Chrysler's sales during the periods covered, less than one-half of 1% of 
Pontiac Grand Prix cars sold that year and of Oldsmobiles sold in that 
program's first three months. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers are taken as proof of product quality, because the reason for 
most returns was not mechanical problems but customer taste, a simple change of 
mind. Typically, say dealers, cars came back because someone disliked the 
color, or the model seemed too small for the family. 
</P>
<P>
There's some disagreement, however, among car dealers (who were compensated for 
any financial losses) about the consumer's view of such programs and about 
whether either traffic or sales were increased at their dealerships. Some say 
customers weren't aware of the program, which lasted in some areas for only a 
couple of months. Others thought customers were well aware; they even joked, 
says Bill Haeger, owner of Des Plaines Chrysler/Plymouth in Illinois, warning 
that "if you don't make me happy, I'm going to bring it back." 
</P>
<P>
At Pontiac, "few took advantage of (the program), and few said it was important 
to them," says Sheila Main at Pontiac in Michigan; when asked, buyers said it 
was neither their primary nor their secondary reason for purchase. At 
Oldsmobile, however, only 11% of November's showroom visitors may have been 
aware of the program, but of those, says Losh, "roughly half indicated it was a 
factor in bringing them in." 
</P>
<P>
Among dealers, Chrysler's Washington experiment -- the money-back offer -- was 
probably least popular, considered "a little strong," laughs Mike Haeger at Des 
Plaines Chrysler/Plymouth. But some thought the exchange program -- extended 
several times in some areas -- an asset. Others thought it "an interesting 
selling tool," says Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston, "but not much more. It was 
well received but didn't result in a stampede." 
</P>
<P>
No one's sure why not, given consumer complaints about new cars. Were the test 
programs so limited and poorly publicized that they don't really prove the 
consumer's lack of interest? Were returns few just because the process of 
choosing and taking title to a car is so arduous that no one wants to do it 
twice, or do aggravating mechanical problems surface only after the first 
month? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps new car shoppers voiced no particular interest because they'd already 
chosen a specific brand. They "came in to buy a Pontiac," says Main, "and were 
going to buy one anyway." Many, adds Chrysler dealer Jack Bosak in 
Merrillville, Ind., "came in for a specific model," although some traded up 
when there. 
</P>
<P>
Of the "one-third of the people in the market for a car who aren't 
model-specific," says Stanley Plog, head of a Reseda-based marketing research 
firm, "how many can you grab their attention, and how many will think it's a 
legitimate offer? There's so much distrust, and people may worry that it's not 
that easy to get in or out (of the deal), that there are probably a lot of 
gimmicks." 
</P>
<P>
The test results may also be skewed by the fact that the market is tired right 
now, overstocked and over-promoted. Sales are off industrywide, and the number 
of people in the market for new cars is, says Plog, the lowest in three years. 
It would take more than an exchange program to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
The real news is in Oldsmobile's stated view that its return policy is a 
long-term commitment, not just a brief promotion. "We think it'll work even 
better over time," says Losh, "not just to draw people in but to make sure they 
come back. Our aim is to provide a good, comprehensive ownership experience" -- 
the return policy, 24-hour roadside service, perhaps eventually loaner cars and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing more and nothing less than customer service -- this is a radical idea 
in the auto industry, and one that deserves attention. If consumers really want 
what they say, Olds could indeed have an "edge" in the market.

For five years, Bart and Patricia Ehman's Pine Ridge Ranch, perched atop a hill 
dotted with 60-year-old apple orchards in rural Sonoma County about 65 miles 
north of San Francisco, has been shipping chickens under the Rocky the Range 
Chicken label. The Ehmans boast that "Rocky is raised on a vegetarian diet and 
allowed to run outdoors in a stress-free environment." 
</P>
<P>
They contend that raising the birds this way makes them juicier and tastier 
than commercial birds that remain cooped up for their few short weeks on earth 
and get frequent injections of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite selling for a hefty premium over standard chickens, Rocky "free-range" 
birds have become popular with many upscale restaurants and groceries. The 
Ehmans lately have been hoping to expand distribution in Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the USDA, which, after a review of several months, decreed that as of 
last Monday the couple could no longer use "range" or "stress free" on their 
Rocky labels. 
</P>
<P>
The Ehmans fear that the change threatens their young business because they 
won't be able to tell potential customers about the special merits right on the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
But the USDA maintains that "ill-defined terms" can mislead consumers and that 
the government would be unable to verify the accuracy of such claims, according 
to Jim Greene, a spokesman for the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably about half a dozen terms that we don't allow on meat and 
poultry products," he added. "What's the use of having something on a label 
that can't be enforced?" 
</P>
<P>
Ehman (pronounced ee-man) has vowed to pick this bone with the highest 
agricultural authority in the land, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, 
possibly with backing from what Ehman called farming rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
As a stopgap measure, the Ehmans printed a wanted poster to explain the 
labeling changes to clients. It features their cartoon character logo of Rocky 
the Chicken -- alias Rocky the Range Chicken -- sporting cowboy hat, boots and 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The Ehmans process only 20,000 or so chickens a week, making their company a 
bantamweight contender among U.S. poultry companies, which together process 90 
million chickens weekly. 
</P>
<P>
But Meat &amp; Poultry magazine, a frequent critic of the free-range chicken 
industry, said large producers have increasingly put pressure on the USDA 
because they feel that smaller companies' claims make mainstream birds seem 
tainted. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Waters, owner of the well-known Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, said 
she thinks that labeling is an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to know what these things mean," she said. Her restaurant recently 
stopped buying Rocky birds in favor of chickens raised in very small numbers on 
the Research Farm near Davis. The birds there are moved outside each morning in 
good weather and eat grass, bugs and whatever else they find. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers see the squabble as much ado about nothing much. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that one word should make a difference," said restaurateur 
Wolfgang Puck, who urged Ehman five years ago to develop a range chicken and 
still occasionally serves Rocky brand chicken at his Spago eatery in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Puck is familiar with the vagaries of government regulations. Two years ago 
when he decided to sell his "designer" pizzas in supermarkets, the USDA said he 
could not call them pizzas because they didn't contain tomato sauce. Puck said 
he got around the problem by applying "an espresso spoonful" of tomatoes to 
each pie. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Rocky birds are sold at Gelson's and Mrs. Gooch's 
(which Ehman inexplicably refers to as Mrs. Goochie's, perhaps confusing it 
with the tony Italian design house). Gelson's in Century City this week quoted 
a price of $2.49 a pound for a Rocky fryer, compared to $1.49 per pound for a 
Zacky Farms bird. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Rocky birds and a smaller counterpart, Rocky Jr., are projected this 
year at between $5 million and $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Raised by Petaluma Poultry Processors to the Ehmans' specifications, Rocky the 
Chicken has indeed been very good to Ehman, 49. He tools around from ranch 
house to chicken ranch in a new silver Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC, and he and his 
wife recently built a white house on a 113-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
"Land up here is scarcer than hen's teeth," Ehman said with a straight face. 
"We were lucky to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman, who said his real love is fishing, acknowledges that he sometimes has 
difficulty getting visitors to grasp the "range" concept, especially during 
winter when the birds tend to flock together near the feeders inside their 
plywood and chicken wire houses rather than wander about outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon at one chicken ranch in nearby Santa Rosa, intermittent 
showers kept all but one game Rocky from venturing out. Clearly, these 
fair-weather fryers have figured out that they are more at home on the range 
when it's warm and sunny, even if they are, as Ehman puts it, "not much more 
intelligent than grass." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make them go outside," he noted, indicating that forced marches would 
scarcely qualify as "stress-free" conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said a legal challenge is a possibility. Said he with more than a hint of 
defiance, "The government might shut us down from all the hell we're raising."

JAPANESE WORKERS GO EXTRA MILE TO ENSURE CARS' QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

OPPAMA, Japan

<TEXT>
<P>
The banners were hung throughout Nissan's sprawling assembly plant here, urging 
workers to attain a goal that many did not even understand at first: 
</P>
<P>
"First in Rogers!" the banners said in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The hidden meaning behind that slogan: All Nissan workers must join as a team 
to build the best cars in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan's executives figured that if one of their cars could be ranked first in 
the Rogers Report, a little-known quality newsletter put out by an Ohio 
research firm, then Nissan could also win top honors in the more prestigious -- 
and more widely publicized -- quality surveys by J. D. Power &amp; Associates, 
an Agoura Hills automotive market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that if we won Rogers, then we would win Power, too," said Nissan 
engineer Masayoshi Horike. "But we had to make some videos to explain what the 
banners meant to the workers." 
</P>
<P>
Such exhortations to pull together as a team may sound corny to Americans, but 
in Japan they really work: Once they understood the banners, the Oppama workers 
went on to help make the Nissan Maxima first in Rogers and first in J. D. Power 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than a decade after the Japanese first became a major force in the 
American car market, Detroit has still failed to catch up on quality. 
</P>
<P>
One key reason is that the Japanese still get their workers to do the little 
things better. They have maintained an obsessive attention to detail that 
results in what industry experts call a better "fit and finish" to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Doors do not rattle. Sheet metal panels line up straight on car bodies. 
Brand-new cars do not have to go back to the dealership to fix annoyingly 
defective light switches or turn signals. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese call such workmanship issues "taken-for-granted quality" -- doing 
the things right that customers expect and demand that you do right. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Americans have caught up in some areas, but I think the gap is 
still great in this 'taken-for-granted' area," observed Katsuyoshi Yamada, 
general manager of quality control at Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, much of the credit for Japanese automotive quality must go to their 
superior design and engineering processes; the Japanese themselves talk 
constantly about the need to "design in" quality before a car ever reaches the 
factory floor. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the genuine sense of teamwork among factory workers here at Oppama and 
elsewhere in Japan has clearly played a critical role in helping the Japanese 
maintain their lead in quality throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are willing to pay attention to details when they really feel that they 
are part of a team, and the Japanese auto companies still do a much better job 
of that than do the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
American executives, of course, have talked teamwork almost to death throughout 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese really live it, and that makes all the difference when it 
comes to exhorting people in a factory to pay attention to details and build 
quality products. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Japanese maintain this sense of teamwork between management and 
labor even though their society is rigidly hierarchical; the Japanese obsession 
with exchanging business cards is part of a subtle effort to determine who 
ranks higher and who should bow the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
But while status and power vary widely in Japan, pay does not. There is a much 
smaller salary differential between boss and employee in Japan than in the 
United States, and the absence of an American-style economic gulf between the 
executive suite and the shop floor seems to be one reason that factory workers 
in Japan believe that management's commitment to teamwork is genuine. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a bucho, or general manager, at Toyota -- one of the top officials 
in the largest company in Japan -- makes only about $120,000 including bonus, 
less than half what a comparable executive would make in Detroit, American auto 
industry officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the current exchange rate, the average Toyota assembly-line 
worker makes nearly $23 per hour, or roughly $49,000 a year, counting bonuses 
and overtime. In fact, with overtime and extra pay for night work, it is even 
possible for a foreman at Toyota to make more than a mid-career engineer, 
according to Toyota spokesman Kanji Sugamoto. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's pay parity even extends to the company chairman and president. 
</P>
<P>
Most chief executives of major Japanese auto companies make $350,000 to 
$450,000 a year, roughly 10 times what their factory workers earn. By contrast, 
the chief executives of American auto companies can make $2 million or more, 
including bonuses and stock options, about 50 times as much as their workers. 
In some years, that ratio has skyrocketed to as much as 500 times more. But 
Japanese executives do not get those glittering perks, such as stock options, 
that have proliferated throughout American industry, inflating executive pay in 
Detroit and across the nation. Such ostentatious compensation is considered 
tactless in Japan. Several Japanese auto companies have recently bought 
helicopters to ferry their executives above Tokyo's massive traffic jams, but 
at least a few reportedly hesitated for fear of appearing too showy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, only a handful of the very highest auto executives are given free cars 
-- which flow like water to every middle manager in Detroit. "I don't get a 
free car," acknowledged Tadahiko Fukuyama, a senior manager in charge of 
Nissan's international public affairs operations. "I just get a 10% discount." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Toyota that, more than most Japanese firms, goes to extreme lengths 
to make sure that its workers do not feel that management is taking advantage 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there is no carpeting on the floors in Toyota's vast engineering 
offices in Toyota City, the company's headquarters town in central Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no carpeting along its assembly lines, Toyota decided that its 
engineers shouldn't have any, either. That's so that when factory workers are 
brought in to discuss new projects with the engineers, they will not think that 
Toyota is treating its engineers any better than its workers on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a kind of corporate socialism here," noted John Shook, who in the 
early 1980s became the first American to work for Toyota in Toyota City. "And 
so the sense of teamwork is genuine. The workers believe it." 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese have had more trouble instilling that spirit of teamwork in 
their workers at their new American factories, a troubling omen for an industry 
that is shifting more and more production from Japan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Discontent has raged this year both at Mazda's Michigan assembly plant and at 
Nissan's Tennessee factory, as workers have complained that Japanese labor 
policies aimed at "constant improvement" are actually being abused to allow 
management to increase line speeds and eliminate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But virtually all of the workers' complaints have been with the way their 
American supervisors manipulate the Japanese labor system, and not with the 
system itself. 
</P>
<P>
"In America, the differences between blue collar and white collar are still 
very strong," noted Horike of Nissan. "It isn't so here."

American Shuffles U.S.-Europe Routes: American Airlines said it will open five 
new routes to Europe, adding 26 flights a week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based carrier said the routes, which will start this summer, are 
between Chicago and London, Glasgow, Scotland, Munich and Dusseldorf, West 
Germany, and between Miami to London. Citing a shortage of long-haul aircraft, 
the airline also said it will drop or postpone the start of flights on a number 
of European routes, including between Chicago and Helsinki, Finland, and 
Warsaw, and Dallas to Barcelona, Spain. It will also drop nonstop service 
between New York and Frankfurt, West Germany.

BOEING TO LAY OFF 1,700, MAY CUT 5,000 JOBS BY YEAR-END 
</P>

Facing a sharp downturn in its defense business, Boeing Co. said Thursday that 
it will lay off about 1,700 hourly employees this week and cut up to 5,000, or 
3% of its work force, by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle-based Boeing, which employed about 164,600 people worldwide at the end 
of 1989, cited the likelihood of lower defense spending in coming years. The 
company is one of the 10 biggest U.S. defense contractors, as well the world's 
largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The company said another reason for the reductions was that a new, larger 
version of its 767 twin-jet aircraft, dubbed the 777, is not yet off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The company has said an official launch of the plane, which is in development 
and will carry 300 to 400 passengers, depends on winning enough orders from 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
It said it will continue to revise its work force throughout the year because 
federal defense spending for the next fiscal year, which starts in October, is 
not yet clear. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's employment rolls have swollen the last two years as it has won large 
aircraft orders from domestic and overseas airlines. Its backlog totals about 
$85 billion, a Boeing spokesman said, and most of that is for commercial 
jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial 1,700 jobs are cut, the rest of the reductions will be 
achieved through layoffs and attrition, Boeing said. It said in December that 
it would reduce its work force this year but did not say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions come after Boeing endured a 45-day strike by about 58,000 
machinists who returned to work late in November. The workers were complaining 
about the form of bonus payments, excessive overtime and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company said most of the 5,000 job cuts could be in Washington, where it 
employs about 106,000. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's U.S. employment stood at 145,200 at the end of 1989. The rest of its 
employees work at subsidiaries overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,700 workers will be issued layoff notices today, but some will continue 
working through April.

WINDHAM HILL RECORDS REPORTED TO BE FOR SALE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE ASKING PRICE IS ESTIMATED AT $50 MILLION. SOME SAY THE 
MARKETER OF NEW AGE MUSIC MAY BE OVER THE HILL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Windham Hill Records, one of the leading marketers of New Age music, an 
increasingly popular genre of light, hypnotic instrumentals that critics 
derisively call "yuppie elevator music," is up for sale for $50 million, 
according to top industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Records is among those reportedly negotiating with the Palo Alto 
company, which had estimated sales of $25 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol officials declined comment. But Anne Robinson, president and chief 
executive of Windham Hill, acknowledged that her company has been talking to 
several interested buyers in recent weeks, although she declined to elaborate 
on how serious the talks were. 
</P>
<P>
"Our distribution agreement with A&amp;M Records expires at the end of March," 
Robinson said. "We have been approached by a number of parties interested in 
either distribution (of our records) or acquisition of our company. I can't say 
any more than that." 
</P>
<P>
The possible sale of Windham Hill comes at a time when prices for record 
companies have soared to astronomical levels and would continue a trend of 
consolidation in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of compact discs in 1983, at least seven prominent 
record companies have been completely or partially acquired by large media 
companies vying to expand their market share. Windham Hill's distributor, 
A&amp;M, which was acquired by Polygram last fall for an estimated $500 
million, was the latest. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it; this is a seller's market right now," said Bob Reitman, general 
manager of Windham Hill's chief competitor, Milwaukee-based Narada Productions. 
"People want to buy record companies, and they are willing to pay a lot of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
As media giants have gobbled up most of the remaining major independents, 
attention has begun to focus on smaller, specialized labels, experts say. And 
the interest in Windham Hill, which pioneered New Age music 14 years ago, is 
just the latest evidence that New Age is moving into the musical mainstream. 
Windham Hill was launched with an unorthodox marketing campaign that included 
mail-order sales and distribution through bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly instrumental music, which has been described as a light and mellow 
mixture of classical piano, jazz fusion and even the sounds of wind, running 
water and chimes, has been chided by music critics as bland and uninventive. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no denying its popularity with yuppies: Windham Hill says the 
average age of its customers is about 30, and most are affluent urban dwellers. 
Such consumers spend an estimated $100 million to $150 million a year 
purchasing New Age music, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Although those figures pale beside the record industry's $6.2 billion in sales 
last year, New Age music has attracted more attention in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Billboard magazine formally recognized the category when it began to 
rank the top New Age records. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are about half a dozen major New Age record companies, and the 
category has grown so popular that the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences has begun awarding a Grammy for the best New Age music. The group 
Shadowfax was last year's winner for their album "Folksongs for a Nuclear Age." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the genre still suffers image and marketing problems that keep it relegated 
to the music industry's backwaters. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Doucet, president of the New Age Music Network in Los Angeles, 
estimates that only about 40% of New Age records are distributed through music 
stores. The remaining 60% are sold through bookstores and other alternative 
outlets because many record store owners are unsure how to effectively market 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'New Age' is a real red herring because, when some people hear it, 
they start thinking about stuff like Shirley MacLaine, meditation and crystals 
and other negative connotations," said Roger Lifeset, an independent New Age 
record promoter in Agoura Hills. "But if you don't label it and treat it simply 
as music, it is much easier" to sell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet just as New Age music seems to be catching on, its main pioneer -- Windham 
Hill -- may be losing steam. 
</P>
<P>
Several of its artists, including Liz Story and Grammy winners Shadowfax, have 
left in recent years. And Windham Hill's best-selling artist, pianist George 
Winston, hasn't released a record in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Larry Hayes, vice president of marketing for Windham Hill, said his 
company had its best sales year ever in 1989, many question Windham Hill's 
dominance today. 
</P>
<P>
Allan D. Chlowitz, general manager of KTWV, says Windham Hill records account 
for a dwindling share of his radio station's play list. And Narada Records, 
with a roster of 16 artists and 11 albums on Billboard's chart, now claims to 
be the top New Age record company. 
</P>
<P>
"Windham Hill started out owning the field," said Chlowitz. "But they are not 
the leaders today they were for many, many years."

Two Competing Pipeline Proposals OKd: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
approved permits for two competing proposals to build a natural gas pipeline to 
California. The permits were granted for the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. 
and the Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which both hope to build a line from 
southwest Wyoming to Kern County. Both firms still must satisfy the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service that the lines will not damage the California habitat of 
the endangered desert tortoise and win the approval of the California Public 
Utilities Commission.

FIRST BOSTON REPLACES CEO IN WAKE OF CAMPEAU FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Boston Corp. on Thursday replaced its chief executive, William E. Mayer, 
in a move seen as stemming from the investment banking firm's exposure to 
losses in the bankruptcy filing of Campeau Corp.'s two main U.S. retailing 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer was replaced by John M. Hennessy, chief executive of First Boston's 
holding company, CS First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer, 49, was named to head a new merchant banking subsidiary to be called CS 
First Boston Merchant Bank, which reportedly will oversee certain First Boston 
investments, including those in the Campeau units, Federated Department Stores 
and Allied Stores. 
</P>
<P>
First Boston emerged in court filings this week as the chief unsecured creditor 
of both Federated and Allied, which on Monday filed for protection from 
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The documents indicate 
that First Boston holds $526 million of the two firms' unsecured obligations. 
</P>
<P>
However, a First Boston spokesman said Wednesday that the filings substantially 
overstate its potential losses in the Campeau debacle. The spokesman, Jack 
Cowell, said the maximum loss First Boston could suffer comes to $293 million, 
including a $250 million "bridge" loan the firm made to help finance Campeau's 
acquisition of Federated in 1988.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: PENSION PLAN CAN BE VITAL TOOL FOR EMPLOYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, Willi Winzelberg sets aside about $30,000 to add to a pension fund 
for himself and his employees at Authorized Camera Service in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It may seem like a lot of money to put in yearly, but it's nothing compared to 
the benefits you get out of it," said Winzelberg, who was able to give his 
partner about $67,000 when he retired from the small company three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We could take the money we put in the pension plan and increase salaries, but 
then Uncle Sam would take a chunk of it," said Winzelberg, who opened the shop 
in 1975 after working for Nikon for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Winzelberg is one of the millions of small-business owners dealing with the 
fact that the number of Americans over age 65 is projected to grow from 28 
million in 1985 to 49 million by 2020. Aside from the tax advantages, a small 
business might find that a pension plan helps to retain good employees. 
</P>
<P>
Winzelberg plans to retire next year and turn the business over to a longtime 
employee. Then Winzelberg will reap the benefits of the pension plan he set up 
several years ago at the suggestion of his accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Authorized Camera Service's pension plan is administered by Sam Gilbert, a 
pension administrator who specializes in counseling small-business owners at 
his United Plan Administrators office in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert and other pension experts said having a pension plan is important for a 
small business, even though the federal rules and regulations governing most 
plans are complex and burdensome. The main attraction is that all the money put 
into a pension fund is deductible as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
"The money becomes taxable only when it is distributed to employees," Gilbert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Where to invest pension money is left up to the business owner and his or her 
financial adviser. Most small-business owners invest their pension money in 
government bonds, certificates of deposit and other conservative investments. 
However, many businesses still put money in the stock market, believing that 
the higher return on investment is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners have four basic options available to them when they are 
ready to set up a pension plan: 
</P>
<P>
* A profit-sharing plan allows a business owner to set aside up to 15% of each 
employee's annual compensation. Under this type of plan, the percentages can 
change each year depending on the company's fortunes. Employees do not 
contribute anything to a profit-sharing plan. 
</P>
<P>
* Business owners who select what is known as a money purchase pension plan may 
set aside up to 25% of a person's salary, but the percentage must stay the same 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
* Defined-benefit pension plans pay out a set percentage of a person's total 
compensation when he retires. Each year, the company must contribute as much as 
it takes to fund that desired benefit. 
</P>
<P>
* One pension option growing in popularity is named after a section of the U.S. 
tax code. A 401(k) plan enables both the employee and the employer to 
contribute tax free. Most employers match the employee contribution in some 
way, but it is not required. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said Congress has recently made the popular defined-benefit plans 
"super-complex, costly and reduced the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Most pension administrators charge $1,000 to $2,000 a year to administer a 
plan. Some also charge an additional fee based on the number of employees 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many large- and small-business owners are complaining about the 
complex pension regulations, Gilbert said Congress has agreed to hold hearings 
on the issue in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems are caused because the people writing the laws do not 
know business," said Paula Calimafde, president of the 1,000-member Small 
Business Council of America in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Calimafde, a tax attorney who specializes in pension matters, said a pension 
plan can be a "very valuable tool" for a small business. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that small businesses that have pension plans are very 
successful in building up income," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Hopson, president of the Santa Ana-based National Institute of Pension 
Administrators, said once you decide to set up a plan, you must fully 
understand the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Hopson, who is president of the Christenson-Hopson Co. in Santa Ana, said she 
is currently helping a bike shop owner who didn't realize that he had to put 
$50,000 into his pension plan every year, no matter how good or bad his sales 
were. Hopson is working with him to terminate that plan and set up something 
easier for him to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Although she does not counsel clients about where to invest their pension 
funds, she does stress the need to be conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"We drum into their heads that this is your retirement, don't lose it, don't 
gamble," she said. "Be careful, it's not Monopoly money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLANNING A PENSION PLAN 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips for employers on setting up a pension plan: 
</P>
<P>
Consider setting up a retirement plan when your business is stable and growing. 
</P>
<P>
Use your pension benefit as anincentive to attract and retain good employees. 
</P>
<P>
Choose your plan based on your company's needs. Companies with cyclic sales 
should consider a profit-sharing plan, rather than a fixed-rate plan. 
</P>
<P>
Pension planners say 401(k) plans are popular because the employees are 
contributing a portion of their salary and feel more involved in their 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you understand exactly what the administrative costs will be. If a 
plan is too expensive to maintain, it may become a burden for your company. 
</P>
<P>
Look for a pension administrator that provides incentives for clients to reduce 
fees.

EX-BANKER SENTENCED IN CREDIT-DATA SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Tustin bank president was placed on a three-year probation Wednesday 
for providing five Las Vegas casinos with phony credit information that was 
used to set up credit lines for several alleged organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange was sentenced to 300 hours of community service 
by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis, a former president of Far Western Bank, had faced a maximum five-year 
prison term and a $10,000 fine after he pleaded guilty in November to one count 
of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding on the probation sentence, Wilson said McGinnis had suffered enough 
from the stigma of a felony conviction, adding that he didn't want to ruin the 
former executive's chances of employment. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the information provided by McGinnis, the casinos loaned thousands of 
dollars to John DeMattia and Morton Goodman. The Justice Department has linked 
the two to a Los Angeles organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand Hotel 
and Casino, the Sands Hotel and Casino and the Desert Inn and Country Club.

ANALYSTS LASH OUT AT MAJORITY OWNER OF J.M. PETERS CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The J.M. Peters Co. may be a favorite of high-end home buyers in Orange County, 
but it appears to rank way down the list of industry analysts Barbara Allen and 
Alan Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, Allen and Goldman savaged Peters' majority owner, 
financially ailing San Jacinto Savings Assn. in Houston, for refusing to 
divulge information about the future of the publicly traded Newport Beach home 
builder. 
</P>
<P>
The Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analysts weren't all that nice to company 
president and namesake J.M. Peters and his crew, either. 
</P>
<P>
"They raked us over the coals," said Brian Theriot, Peters' investor relations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they downgraded their estimates of 1990 and 1991 earnings for the 
company by about 30%, claiming it has "precious little direction or focus" 
because of the uncertainty over its future ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she and Goldman aren't worrying that J.M. Peters itself is in 
trouble. "It's a good little company with a good reputation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But they voiced concern that because Peters homes are at the top end of the 
price scale they will be among the hardest hit in a real estate slump. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, though, the analysts are critical of the paucity of information the 
Peters company, San Jacinto Savings and the S&amp;L's owner, bankrupt Southmark 
Corp. in Dallas, have provided the stock-buying public about the fate of the 
S&amp;L's 87% stake in J.M. Peters Co. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto owns 12 million shares of J.M. Peters and, because of its financial 
troubles, is seeking to sell them to raise cash. But public knowledge stops 
there, Allen and Goldman complain. 
</P>
<P>
If the analysts had their way, the investing public would be told whether an 
outright sale of Peters is the only recourse, whether Peters himself is a 
potential buyer, and whether San Jacinto wants to sell its shares on the open 
market or will only deal with a corporate buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Southmark's proposed reorganization plan, filed in bankruptcy court on 
Wednesday, sheds no new light on the Peters situation. A spokeswoman for the 
company said the plan still is that San Jacinto will sell the shares but that 
no other information is available.

PARTNER BUYING CONTROL OF PACIFIC NATIONAL BANK; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVER: A SANTA ANA ATTORNEY HOPES TO INTRODUCE THE SMALL INSTITUTION TO THE 
EUROPEAN MARKET. IRELAND HAS PICKED IT AS ONE OF ABOUT 125 FINANCIAL CONCERNS 
TO BE HOUSED IN A DUBLIN BUSINESS ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana lawyer Terry M. Giles is taking control of Pacific National Bank, 
infusing more cash into the already-healthy institution and introducing the 
small Santa Ana-based bank into the European market. 
</P>
<P>
Giles will have a majority interest in the bank once regulators approve his 
deal to buy out his partner and friend, former Computerland owner William H. 
Millard. Giles said he expects federal regulators to approve the plan sometime 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Giles, who also bought out Millard's interests in other investments the two 
made, hopes to attract $8 million in investments to bolster the bank's business 
in Ireland, where it has won a spot in a special business zone for 
international financial service firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish government selected Pacific National as one of about 125 financial 
institutions that will be housed in a Dublin business zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited," Giles said. "I don't know if other California banks have 
been approved, but we're surely the only independent bank in the world in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Other banks approved for space in the Irish project include Citicorp and Chase 
Manhattan in New York, West Germany's Dresdner Bank and Japan's Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Giles, 41, traveled to Ireland eight times last year to seal the deal. He 
attracted investments from two European banks and a West German builder-banker 
in Pacific National. 
</P>
<P>
His effort to put Pacific National into international play came as he agreed to 
buy out Millard and gain majority control of the bank's holding company, PNB 
Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Millard and Giles, who already owned small amounts of PNB stock and had been 
directors, formed their Merchant House partnership a year ago and paid $4.7 
million for new PNB stock, acquiring a 50.3% stake in the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, who lives in Saipan, had provided most of that money but remained a 
passive investor. Giles took over as bank chairman last March. Giles had been 
the bank's chairman in 1985 and 1986, before resigning to handle a trial for 
Millard and then engineering the sale of Millard's Computerland stock. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has branches in Newport Beach and Irvine, had $116 million in 
assets at the end of 1989. It expects to report its first $1-million annual 
profit since opening eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said his goal when Merchant House invested in PNB was to raise the bank's 
capital from $6 million to $30 million by the end of this year. That should 
enable the bank to grow five times larger. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's growth plans have included attempts to acquire other financial 
institu tions, but Giles said he was frustrated in his purchase attempts last 
year because would-be deals have fallen apart quickly. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as regulators approve changing control of PNB and the bank to Giles, 
the lawyer said, the three European investors will put $8 million into Merchant 
House for a minority stake in the company, and that money will go directly into 
the bank's capital base, its final reserve against losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He would not reveal the investors' names. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking to make money out of Merchant House, but to pump up capital," 
Giles said. "Then I'll make my money off dividends later." 
</P>
<P>
Stocking the bank with capital, Giles said, meant that he would have to create 
cash flow for himself elsewhere. So he also bought out Millard's interest in 
all other investments the lawyer had advised Millard to make in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A financially strong bank will be important to take advantage of business 
opportunities in Europe. From the Dublin financial center, Pacific Financial 
and other financial service firms can take advantage of the unified economic 
market that will be created in 199, when trade barriers begin to fall among the 
12-nation European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said Computerland may do some business with Pacific National. But the 
bank will take advantage of its Irish base to try to gain business from Orange 
County companies doing business in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The bank will also use its European bank investors to help make loans and 
provide other services that Pacific National would be too small to do on its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
The Dublin site offers financial institutions a modern telecommunications 
systems, a skilled population and a low, 10% corporate tax rate, in contrast 
with the regular 50% corporate rate. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies can keep their accounts in currencies of their choice for 
tax purposes, and they can take advantage of special interest rates on loans. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said the financial services zone, approved by the European Community for 
economically distressed Ireland, will allow banks to offer loans at rates 20% 
lower than the going rates. Like other banks, he said, PNB's new subsidiary 
there will offer rates probably 10% lower to provide a good profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still a small grain on a large pile of sand," he said. "But we're going 
to be able to service U.S. companies doing business in Europe -- and Europe is 
the place to do business in the 1990s."

WESTAMERICA SET TO SELL LAND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY

Westamerica Inc., a publicly owned residential development company, said 
Thursday that it is negotiating to sell two vacant subdivisions in Riverside 
County in a deal worth $12 million to $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective buyer is Griffin Homes, a privately held developer 
headquartered in Calabasas, according to a report Westamerica filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Griffin could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Westamerica, which moved to Orange County from Minnesota in 1987, builds 
entry-level single family homes, mostly in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, said Theodor Nickolas Bodnar, firm chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company often buys land at low prices years before there is a local 
market for homes, obtains the necessary zoning and building clearances and 
then, when a market does develop, sells the undeveloped subdivisions to other 
builders "at a big profit." 
</P>
<P>
The properties Griffin is interested in, Bodnar said, fall into that category. 
One is a 156-lot subdivision in Rancho Temecula and the other is a 147-lot 
subdivision in Lake Elsinore.

SOUR NOTE OVER MONEY: SYMPHONY PULLS OUT OF CONCERT WITH CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony has pulled out of a Feb. 9 concert with the Master Chorale 
of Orange County over money owed by the chorale for previous engagements. 
</P>
<P>
John Rhynerson, chairman of the board for the Costa Mesa-based Master Chorale, 
confirmed that the chorale owes the orchestra about $37,000 for performing in 
the chorale's Oct. 27 and Dec. 3 concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Rhynerson said the chorale released the orchestra from the Feb. 9 concert at 
the Center with a letter dated Dec. 22, when it became clear that the chorale 
could not retire the debt before a 30-day cancellation clause went into effect 
for the coming performance. The chorale plans to pay off the debt Monday, 
Rhynerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Pacific Symphony could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The chorale is assembling its own orchestra for the Feb. 9 concert through the 
local musicians' union, with no changes planned in the performance program. 
Ironically, Rhynerson noted, many Pacific Symphony musicians will probably 
perform in what has been dubbed the Master Chorale Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Rhynerson stressed that the situation does not signal a financial crisis for 
the chorale, which has traditionally had cash-flow problems in the second half 
of its season. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly can't deny the fact that we owe them money," Rhynerson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "We are not in a major financial problem. We have money set 
aside for the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
This week the chorale mailed out a fund-raising pitch asking donors to "buy a 
chair in the Master Chorale orchestra," putting price tags on everything from a 
clarinetist ($250) to a principal player ($500) to one of two vocal soloists 
($2,000) and even conductor William Hall ($5,000). 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony, Rhynerson said, has in the past been lenient in 
collecting fees from the chorale but this year has decided to put payments on a 
tighter schedule. The orchestra had signaled that it would bow out of the Feb. 
9 concert if previous debts were not retired 30 days before the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Rhynerson said the new stringency "certainly surprises us. . . . We will pay 
them and we have always." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the situation may affect the chorale's future relationship with 
the Pacific, with the possibility that the chorale will turn to contracting 
with its own orchestra for future subscription dates. The chorale has used the 
Pacific for the last two seasons but assembled its own orchestra before that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to take that up with our board," Rhynerson said.

CLARIFICATION 
</P>
<P>
An index item Friday indicated incorrectly that Pacific Symphony musicians have 
not been paid for performances with the Master Chorale of Orange County. In 
fact, the musicians have been paid. The chorale owes the money to symphony 
management.

IMPROV CRAZIES TO MAUL MOGULS OF ORANGE COUNTY;

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this: Donald L. Bren, Henry T. Segerstrom, William Lyon, J.M. Peters 
and other assorted Orange County real estate moguls get together behind closed 
doors for a secret . . . game of Monopoly! 
</P>
<P>
Crazy? That's the point. The local landed gentry are just one target of the 
satirical jabs of the Orange County Crazies, a new improvisational comedy 
troupe that makes its debut with two shows Saturday at the Santa Ana Civic 
Center Annex. 
</P>
<P>
The group is the brainchild of Cherie Kerr, an improv veteran who was a 
founding member of the Groundlings, the Los Angeles group that serves as a 
model for the Crazies. Orange County people and places provide the grist for 
Kerr and her troops, who take swipes at everything from swank restaurants and 
Caltrans workers to the Rev. Robert H. Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
"I've long had a dream to bring a Saturday Night Live/Groundlings/Second City 
kind of thing to Orange County," Kerr said. She finally held auditions in 
September, selecting 15 Crazies from among 35 hopefuls. The troupe has settled 
at 13 performers, plus a technical crew of six. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr, 46, who is executive producer and artistic director, has high hopes for 
the project: She has lined up shows each Saturday through May 26, sometimes two 
nightly, at venues including the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove and the Fine Arts 
Recital Hall at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. By the time that run ends, Kerr said, she wants the Crazies to 
have a place of their own, with a theater of about 250 seats and space for an 
improvisation school. Kerr said she already has real estate brokers scouting 
possible locations, particularly abandoned industrial sites that can be 
converted. 
</P>
<P>
Besides housing the Crazies, the facility would provide a venue for other types 
of "alternative" entertainment, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like a pipe dream, but Kerr -- who runs her own public relations 
agency in Huntington Beach -- is a serious businesswoman who thinks that the 
Crazies can take off. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a nice machine behind us to make this a real professional effort," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest goal, Kerr said, is to provide a showcase for county talent, which 
she believes is neglected by scouts from over the county line. "To me, that 
would be the ultimate reward," she said, "if someone made the big time because 
of what they did here. I think that could happen with some of the people in 
this group." 
</P>
<P>
Kerr's enthusiasm for the project seems to have rubbed off. "There's a drive 
and charisma about the group," said LizAnne of the charter Crazies. "I'm 
looking for this to turn into a real success." 
</P>
<P>
LizAnne, who goes by that single name, is one of the more experienced members 
of the ensemble. With just a few high school plays under her belt, she met Kerr 
11 years ago when she was a student at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard of improv before," said LizAnne, 30, who became hooked after 
studying with Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
She took part in some early efforts at establishing the Crazies and taught in 
Kerr's Execuprov program, a sideline in which she teaches comedy improvisation 
techniques to corporate types looking to enhance their public- speaking 
abilities and image. 
</P>
<P>
Working full time as the manager of a fast-food restaurant, LizAnne has also 
found time to do some stand-up comedy and radio commercials. Now, she will 
appear in several guises in "This Is Orange County," the first Crazies show, 
including Babs Marblehead, a contestant in a Miss Orange County contest and a 
fast-rising corporate executive in "Yuppie Girl Rap." 
</P>
<P>
Improv, LizAnne said, can be frightening, but is ultimately a satisfying outlet 
for her comic energies: "You don't work from a script. You don't know what the 
heck you're going to do. That's what makes improv such an exciting type of 
performing. . . . It's also very dangerous. It might not work." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 skits in "This is Orange County." Kerr came up with the 
initial ideas, then group members fleshed them out in rehearsals. About 
two-thirds of the material is set, Kerr said, with the remainder improvised 
according to audience suggestions. In one example, a parody of the game show 
"Jeopardy" called "Yuppardy," the audience suggests the trivia categories. 
</P>
<P>
A new Crazies show will debut every few months, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Successful improvisation depends on trust and teamwork, something group member 
Kimberley Adams, 27, said the Crazies have managed to build. "We communicate 
really well," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
When things are working, she added, "it's just like floating on water." 
</P>
<P>
"It's much like jazz," said Bruce Brown, 33, a musician who, as lounge singer 
Frankie Capistrano, contributes an original tune -- in his best Sinatra 
imitation -- that includes lots of county locales. "I like the daredevil aspect 
of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody really does trust everybody else," said group member Sean 
Kerr, 23. "It makes you feel really comfortable on stage." 
</P>
<P>
Kerr has had a lifelong exposure to improv. Cherie Kerr's son, he remembers 
sitting in on Groundlings shows as a 6-year-old, watching Mom along with such 
group members as Laraine Newman (later of "Saturday Night Live"), Paul Reubens 
(now Pee-wee Herman) and Cassandra Peterson (who made her mark as Elvira, 
Mistress of the Dark). 
</P>
<P>
Cherie Kerr daughter of show-biz parents -- Mom was a singer and dancer, Dad a 
jazz bassist -- came to comedy after the breakup of her first marriage. She 
began taking improvisation courses with Gary Austin, becoming part of a group 
that evolved into the Groundlings. 
</P>
<P>
She left the group after a few years to try her hand at TV writing, later 
concentrating on her public relations career. But she kept in touch with her 
fellow Groundlings, taking part in a reunion show and later heading the 
troupe's alumni group. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr has also kept her hand in improv by teaching privately and at community 
colleges and by heading her Execuprov workshops. 
</P>
<P>
But starting the Crazies has been her dream for years. At auditions she found 
that "some of the talent was very raw, . . . but they were funny," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The project, she added, has "far exceeded what I thought it would be at this 
stage of the game." 
</P>
<P>
She anticipates that there may be objections to some of the material. One skit, 
for instance, takes the Carl's Jr. concept of hiring the elderly and disabled 
and transplants it into a skit set in a pricey county restaurant (as selected 
by the audience). The help, including a blind busboy, bumbles through the scene 
to the consternation of a couple trying to have a romantic evening. 
</P>
<P>
The point, Kerr said, is not to laugh at the disabled but to create an absurd 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr also said she is not worried about the consequences of tweaking some of 
the county's high-profile government, business and religious figures. "I'm sure 
some people are going to want to run us out of town," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County, she said, is just too up-tight: "We need to loosen this town 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Crazies will perform Saturday and Jan. 27 at 7:30 and 10 
p.m. at Santa Ana Civic Center Annex, 20 Civic Center Plaza. The early show 
Saturday is sold out. Tickets: $10. Information: (714) 840-1406.

The Saturday debut of the Orange County Crazies does not mark the first attempt 
at establishing a local comedy troupe. Fractured Mirror, a six-member team that 
makes the L.P.R. Dinner Theatre its home, has been playing the county for six 
years now. 
</P>
<P>
Trisha Burson, a member of Fractured Mirror, said her troupe is different from 
the Crazies. Her group's material is almost entirely scripted, for instance, 
and the topics range beyond the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We say that we do a splash of improv," Burson said. "We run the gamut from 
very silly to some serious pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Burson said there is room in the county for two comedy groups: "Orange County 
is really starting to expand its awareness of the performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
Fractured Mirror took December off from performing to write new material. The 
group plays in Long Beach this weekend and plans to return to the L.P.R. in 
early February. RICK VANDERKNYFF

GROUP TO STAGE PLAY IN COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Susana Repertory Company has announced the schedule for its second 
season, including a production of the courtroom drama "Inherit the Wind" that 
will be staged in Simi Valley's City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"When the council chambers were originally designed in 1984, the idea was that 
they should be used for purposes other than governmental meetings," said Brian 
Gabler, an assistant to the city manager. "When Santa Susana Repertory was 
searching for a location, the City Council was very enthusiastic about them 
coming here." 
</P>
<P>
So, the fledgling company -- which does not yet have a permanent stage -- will 
open at City Hall Feb. 23 with its version of the 1955 play about the trial of 
Tennessee biology teacher John T. Scopes, who broke state law by teaching 
Darwinism in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the season will include a three plays and "A Christmas Carol" 
for next holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana Repertory had hoped to premiere a play by Dale Wasserman, who 
wrote the musical "Man of La Mancha" and now serves as a board member for the 
theatrical group. Production costs prohibited that show. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the repertory company has tightened its money belt to make up for last 
season when, several weeks before opening "La Mancha," the troupe was informed 
by city officials that it could not stage plays in an empty, donated 
supermarket. The company was forced to rent a $7,500-a-month tent for its 
well-reviewed production. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great expense," said David Ralphe, who has directed a number of the 
company's plays. "But it's a fact of life. It's not stopping us." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Santa Susana Repertory's second season will again play under the big 
top. This season the company has had time to shop for a less costly tent that 
will be raised on a vacant lot between the library and City Hall, where the 
city's planned cultural center is to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"Lion in Winter" opens May 16. "Jesse and the Bandit Queen," a retelling of the 
romance between Jesse James and Belle Starr, opens June 14. "Romeo and Juliet" 
opens July 6. 
</P>
<P>
While all of this is going on, the company will present Saturday matinees of a 
children's musical. An improvisational comedy show will play late Saturday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christmas Carol" opens Nov. 24 at an undetermined site.

ROWDY PUB'S PATRONS GET INTO THE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's more like a yell-along than a sing-along Thursday nights at Pickwick's. 
</P>
<P>
Banging their beer glasses on the tables of the Woodland Hills pub, hordes of 
patrons keep a tipsy semblance of time to songs from the 1950s, '60s and '70s, 
while screaming words of the choruses. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the weekly bacchanal, Pickwick's new owner, Craig Holman, 
recently vacuumed the sawdust off the wood floors and covered them with thick 
carpeting in hopes of reducing his glassware bill. 
</P>
<P>
Holman, an Englishman whose primary source of income is his insurance agency, 
has also cracked down on overcrowding since he bought the place about a year 
ago. Now, a long line of would-be Mick Jaggers and Tiny Tims snakes down the 
block, waiting to pay a $3 cover charge for guitarist Gary Ballen to take them 
on a musical rock 'n' roller coaster back in time. 
</P>
<P>
Ballen, 37, has tirelessly been playing the same old songs at the pub since he 
started the sing-along seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Strange as it is, I must have sung 'Twist and Shout' a million times, but I 
still dig it cuz the crowd digs it," said Ballen, who has a full-time job 
managing rap groups. "The thing I like about it is I can stop playing, and the 
whole crowd will belt out the song." 
</P>
<P>
They don't call them baby boomers for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
One Thursday recently, the twenty-to-thirtysomething crowd that jammed the pub 
sang loud, albeit somewhat off-key, versions of such favorites as the 
Flintstones theme song and "Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a terrible singer, but that's what's great," said Chris Atkinson, 25, of 
Calabasas. "You can grind it out, and with the whole crowd singing, no one can 
hear you." 
</P>
<P>
Ballen takes requests, but don't ask for Barry Manilow because he won't play 
any of his music. However, he occasionally plays an original ballad called "The 
Bumper Sticker Song." The first verse goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 If you can read this bumper sticker, you're much too close 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers carry big loads 
</P>
<P>
 If you love Jesus, honk your horn 
</P>
<P>
 Slow down, I brake for unicorns 
</P>
<P>
 Many patrons are regulars who say they look forward to Thursday nights at the 
pub as a release from working and studying. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get that snotty crowd like at dance clubs," said Greg Hodgson, 24, a 
physical therapy student at CSUN. "It's basically a fun, let-loose, Levi's and 
T-shirt type of place." 
</P>
<P>
The pub really gets in a frenzy when Ballen strums the first chords of "Wipe 
Out," a surf-rock instrumental first performed by the Surfaris in 1963. One 
patron, wearing buttons pinned to her neon green shirt that say "Responsibility 
Is a Bitch" and "I Like Boys," even begins to shriek like an old-time Beatle 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new carpet, several beer mugs bounce off the tables and break when 
patrons use them as drumsticks. Other people beat time wildly on the darkly 
varnished benches. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the song was banned by the former owner because the crowd got so 
rowdy, Ballen says. Even now, owner Holman cringes when Ballen plays "Wipe 
Out," but he hasn't banned it because "it's part of the legend of Thursday 
nights at Pickwick's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For people who like to hear themselves sing, the pub also has sing-alongs on 
Friday and Saturday nights that draw a more subdued crowd, Holman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickwick's, 21010 Ventura Blvd. Sing-alongs Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 9 p.m. 
to 1 a.m. Pub's hours are Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 1 a.m., Sunday, 
11 a.m. to midnight.

studying. The Surfari's 1963 hit "Wipe Out" is a favorite. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los

RESTAURANT REVIEW;

<P>
YAMAKAWA OFFERS AN OASIS FOR ETHNIC FOOD IN TOLUCA LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a few years ago Toluca Lake and the neighboring parts of Burbank were 
utterly bereft of ethnic restaurants. The most exotic possibility, though 
hardly authentic, was Kosherama Chow's Delicatessen and Cantonese Cuisine in 
Burbank, where you could (and still can, for that matter) eat chow mein with 
your pastrami sandwich. But things have started to change. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, you can find yourself deciding which flavor of fried ice cream to 
choose at Yamakawa in Toluca Lake, a cheery place run by a mother-daughter 
team. From the outside it seems like a small place; the unassuming exterior has 
large windows through which you can watch the sushi chefs as they work. Walk 
inside, however, and the uncomplicated interior seems surprisingly large. 
</P>
<P>
The two rooms peripheral to the main dining area and sushi bar are discreetly 
placed so as not to make the main room seem small. It took an embarrassingly 
long time for me to realize that there were no other rooms, just mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's food is freshly prepared and reasonably priced. The menu's 
dinner in a box, a version of the traditional Japanese bento, or picnic box, is 
especially welcome. The black and red lacquered box's compartments contain a 
salad with a creamy sesame dressing; a large portion of well-textured shrimp 
and vegetable tempuras; a gyoza, a dumpling filled with seasoned chopped pork; 
a sizable portion of chicken, beef or salmon teriyaki; crab meat, rice and 
chunks of fresh pineapple. This copious feast costs $8.95 at dinner and $6.80 
at lunch; sushi or sashimi can be substituted for one of the meat choices. 
</P>
<P>
If you choose one of the regular dinners -- various fish, teriyakis and 
tempuras -- that come with miso soup and rice, you may want to start the meal 
with sushi or an appetizer. Yakitori, chunks of chicken marinated in soy sauce 
and grilled with scallions, and soft shell crabs, quickly fried in tempura 
batter, are particularly lively here. 
</P>
<P>
Dynamite -- scallops, mushrooms and scallions covered with a mayonnaise-like 
sauce and broiled in a large shell -- is a bit hearty for one person as an 
appetizer, but is just right for sharing. (The lobster entree, cut-up lobster 
meat similarly prepared and broiled in its own shell, doesn't work). Deep-fried 
prawns, though excellent, are oddly priced -- $6.80 gets you two prawns, while 
the entire bento dinner, which includes three tempura shrimp, costs just a 
little more. 
</P>
<P>
Yamakawa's fish entrees are served broiled, fried, teriyaki-style or 
shioyaki-style. The last is one of those deceptively simple methods by which 
Japanese chefs so frequently bring out the best in fish. It calls for lightly 
salting the fish, which should have its skin still on. The presence of the skin 
ensures that the fish's natural oils are not lost. 
</P>
<P>
The sushi menu at Yamakawa is ample. In addition to many familiar items, there 
is what may be an homage to Kosherama, or at least to some of its customers: 
Along with the cucumber roll and the California roll, there is a Philly roll. 
It's a handsome, large-diameter composition made of chunks of salmon, cream 
cheese and julienned cucumber wrapped in seaweed and rolled in rice, encrusted 
with the tiny red roe of flying fish. It tasted quite good, but was almost as 
heavy as lox and cream cheese on a bagel. The crisped salmon skin salad, on the 
other hand, was light and refreshing and far more satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Now, back to the fried ice cream. Yamakawa offers five flavors: vanilla, plum 
wine, green tea, red bean and ginger. First of all, I'd ask them to hold the 
whipped cream, which turns the supposedly tempura-crisp crust to mush. Then I'd 
order only one as a test before splurging on a round for everyone. On second 
thought, I wouldn't order it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamakawa, 10118 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake. (818) 763-8355. Open Monday to 
Saturday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. Beer and wine. American 
Express, MasterCard, Visa accepted. Parking lot. Dinner for two, food only 
(excluding sushi), $18 to $36.

COMMON MOORHEN 
</P>
<P>
(Gallinula chloropus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Black head and neck, with red forehead shield, red bill with 
yellow tip. Back is brownish-olive; underparts slate; white streaking on flanks 
shows as a thin white line. 
</P>
<P>
Legs and feet are yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Found in fresh-water marshes, lakes and ponds, usually with emergent 
vegetation and grassy edges. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation; also mollusks (especially snails), worms; 
berries, fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: With head low, wings partly raised and open, elevates tail exposing 
white undertail feathers. Male bends head down and in toward feet; male and 
female bow. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually over water (with ramps leading down to water), occasionally on 
ground or in low shrub. Occasionally unused nests, brooding and roosting 
platforms nearby and old nests of jays and magpies. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Cinnamon/buff, marked with reddish-brown or olive colors. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: These birds are cooperative breeders with young of first 
brood, often aiding in care of subsequent broods and in defense of territory. 
Younger birds lay smaller clutches than older birds and lay later. Young 
usually hatch asynchronously. Wing spur aids young in climbing. (The Common 
moorhen was once called the Common Gallinule.) 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.

A JOURNEY INTO COMEDY'S INFERNO; 
</P>
<P>
NIGHTCLUBS: A LOOK AT THREE OF THE VALLEY'S COMEDY CLUBS SHOWS THAT LAUGHS TURN 
INTO NOT-SO-FUNNY BUSINESS.

During the early '60s boom in folk music, it seemed that anyone who could buy a 
guitar was automatically a folk singer. 
</P>
<P>
Today it seems that anyone with a thick skin, double-jointed lips and a lot of 
brass fancies himself a comic, and fortunately -- or unfortunately, depending 
on your sense of humor -- the San Fernando Valley offers them a number of 
outlets. Experienced professionals have a place to try out new material, and 
some establishments provide a minor league training ground for aspiring 
stand-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a diary of a journey to a trio of Valley comedy spots. The 
material ranges from fairly sophisticated stuff to jokes that elicit only a 
deadly silence. One thing seems certain: The audience can count on hearing a 
chorus of "Give yourself a hand" almost anywhere you go. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: Sammy's Fireside Inn in Burbank schedules more than comedy. On Friday 
and Saturday nights, this neighborhood bar offers dancing to the music of an 
oldies but goodies band and on Thursday, Sammy's dishes up spaghetti for $1.99. 
Tuesdays and Wednesdays are comedy nights. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy's, not surprisingly for a bar, also has a color television, which on this 
night is tuned to a baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Montreal 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
As 9 o'clock rolls around, the master of ceremonies, Rick Barker, welcomes the 
audience of about 14, consisting mostly of that night's performers. He reminds 
them that this is a comedy show and if they don't think any of this stuff is 
funny they can watch the baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
Barker introduces the first act -- a man named Jim who appears to be in his 
mid-20s -- as someone who is a regular at Sammy's. 
</P>
<P>
His first joke? "I've got a secret to tell you -- Lucy's dead." 
</P>
<P>
The room is so silent you could hear a soggy cocktail napkin drop. 
</P>
<P>
After that less than auspicious start, it is all downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 (Look at Time Element) The Expos aren't doing too well either. The Braves are 
ahead 7-6, but Tim Raines, one of the National League's best hitters, is up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the guy on stage is dying a horrible death. "As a child, my parents 
encouraged me to take candy from strangers. . . ." He polls the audience, 
asking if he should sit down -- nobody votes. 
</P>
<P>
 (Time Element) Raines runs the count to 3 and 2 and strikes out. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy on stage should be so lucky. His act by this time has degenerated into 
a heavy group therapy session: 
</P>
<P>
"Schoolyard bullies always used to pick on me 'cause I was a nerd." 
</P>
<P>
 (TIME ELEMENT) The next batter knocks the ball back to the box and the side is 
retired -- no runs, no hits, no errors. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like the comedian is completing his second hour on stage. But the 
clock says 9:15 when, finally, he makes his exit and Barker introduces the next 
performer. A middle-aged man named Phil takes the spotlight. He asks the crowd, 
"Do you want to hear something funny?" The audience yells back lustily, "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
Phil spends a long time warming up the audience, saying things like: "A lot of 
good-looking women in the audience tonight," "I really enjoy being here at 
Sammy's," "Give yourselves a hand" and "There's a lot of good-looking men in 
the audience tonight, too." The warm-up seems to help. The audience appears to 
like his act and he gets a nice hand for an extraordinary Humphrey Bogart 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining acts all blur into one long descent into comic hell. Bully jokes, 
drug jokes, urination jokes. The faces in the audiences seem as if they are 
made of stone. 
</P>
<P>
Someone on stage notices that I am taking notes and asks, "What are you writing 
down there? Are you going to start your own comedy act?" That was one of the 
funniest things I heard all night. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Gallagher's has been a fixture in the Chatsworth area for about nine 
years. The Irish pub schedules live rock music on Fridays and Saturdays, darts 
on Mondays and Wednesdays and comedy on Thursdays and Sundays. The bartender 
said they tried a thumb-wrestling tournament on Tuesdays but it didn't go over. 
</P>
<P>
Darts are the big thing at Gallagher's. There are three dart boards and the 
walls are covered with championship plaques. But the management also has made a 
commitment of sorts to comedy nights, evidenced by a sparkly green curtain that 
serves as a backdrop for the comedians. The stage lighting is brighter than it 
is at Sammy's and the TV and jukebox are turned off during performances. Most 
important, perhaps, is a ban on pool and dart playing during the routines. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. sharp, master of ceremonies Jay Bernard delivers a rapid-fire string 
of one liners: 
</P>
<P>
"My first day in Vietnam, I was charged by a wild beast. I think she charged me 
$5." 
</P>
<P>
The audience numbers about 40 and is more responsive than the crowd at Sammy's, 
except for a couple sitting at the bar who are negotiating loudly. "Are you 
gonna pick me up, honey?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
There are fewer acts than at Sammy's. The showcase lasts until 10:10 p.m. Some 
of the comics are rewarded with laughs and applause; others bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Phil, the middle-aged comic from Sammy's, is here too. Without the Braves and 
Expos as competition, Phil gets a better reception. "We have a lot of 
good-looking women in the audience tonight," "Give yourselves a hand. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: L.A. Cabaret in Encino is the triple-A club of the Valley comedy 
circuit. It's a big room (seating 200) and it is devoted exclusively to comedy 
-- no darts, no music, no spaghetti. It even has a printed program, a menu and 
a box office. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Cabaret has something else the other two clubs don't -- a $14 admission 
charge. Included in that are tickets for two drinks. The bouncer, a roundish 
muscular man, advises me that I can wait in line outside or I can go into the 
bar, buy yet another drink and be assured of a good seat when they open the 
showroom for the second show. 
</P>
<P>
"We always let the bar people in first," he says slyly, and I buy the drink. 
</P>
<P>
The wall above the bar is covered with framed 8-by-10 black and white glossies. 
I don't recognize most of the faces but occasionally a very young Gabe Kaplan, 
or a younger and thinner Bob Zany smiles back at me. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the showroom is opened and true to the word of the bouncer, the 
customers in the bar are let in first. The house is almost full, and it looks 
like a young crowd. 
</P>
<P>
How young is it? This crowd is so young, the club owner has posted a notice on 
the table explaining what a "well-drink" is. (A well-drink, for the 
uninitiated, is one that uses the house liquor, usually not a name brand.) 
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies Larry Omaha comes on. He's a slick, polished professional 
who starts off with a series of jokes that are less than complimentary to 
Mexican-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's the admission charge (at $14 a pop, this stuff had better be 
funny). Or maybe the audience just has a special affinity for comics named 
after cities in Nebraska. But, the crowd really loves this guy. They're 
laughing at everything. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't believe that I'm Mexican, they think I'm Filipino." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd loves it. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not only Omaha. All night long, act after act is killing this 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the comics share Omaha's polished professionalism, although every 
performer seems to have at least one joke about Asians driving automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
As I was leaving I saw Omaha standing alone, stone-faced and grim; a sharp 
contrast to his stage appearance. Laughter is a serious business.

A motorist who tried to pull to the side of the San Diego Freeway today after 
debris caused a tire blowout in the car pool lane was involved in a two-vehicle 
accident in which four people were injured. The southbound lanes were closed 
for more than 90 minutes during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. when a sports car that was pulling to the 
shoulder was struck from behind by a pick-up truck just north of the Fairview 
Road off-ramp, California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The sports car slammed into the center divider and the truck crossed all 
traffic lanes and crashed into trees off the right shoulder of the freeway, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
All four lanes of the freeway were closed from 5:39 a.m to 7:10 a.m today as 
rescue workers pried the victims from the wreckage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters were sent to the scene to take the driver and two passengers of the 
sports car and the sole occupant of the truck to nearby hospitals. The victims' 
names and extent of their injuries were not immediately known, Johnson said.

Rusty Hamer, the child actor in the television series "Make Room for Daddy" in 
the 1950s and '60s, shot himself to death at age 42, his brother said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamer was found dead in his home Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very unhappy, very confused young man," John Hamer said. "No one does 
something like that if they aren't confused. I've heard of a lot of child 
actors who have become unhappy with their lives after they've left the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
On the TV series, Rusty Hamer played the part of Rusty, and Danny Thomas played 
his father, a nightclub singer and comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Hamer had his first movie role at the age of 5, and appeared in several Abbott 
and Costello films. 
</P>
<P>
The Danny Thomas show was one of television's most durable and popular 
situation comedies. Most of the cast, including Hamer, returned in 1970-71 with 
a sequel, "Make Room for Granddaddy," in which Rusty was a married medical 
student. 
</P>
<P>
Hamer returned to southwest Louisiana in 1976. He had held several different 
jobs since.

Facing mounting public opposition, Soviet authorities today suspended their 
emergency call-up of reserve troops to stem the warfare in Azerbaijan and 
Armenia, while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blamed extremists opposed to his 
reforms for the ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader said some Azerbaijanis were calling for a separate Islamic 
state. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came amid reports Azerbaijanis brought arms into the country over 
the border they have forced open with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 29,000 troops sent to the southern republics have been unable to 
reach their destinations because hundreds of Azerbaijanis have blocked airports 
and roads with trucks and buses, opposing what they view as Kremlin 
interference.

D.C. MAYOR CHARGED ON 1 DRUG COUNT; 
</P>

LAWYER SAYS BARRY WILL PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR

<P>
Mayor Marion Barry, who has repeatedly denied using narcotics, was charged 
today on one count of possessing highly addictive "crack" cocaine in a episode 
filmed by undercover police. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Barry, one of the best-known and most controversial black 
politicians in America, was charged in a federal court after his arrest 
Thursday night in a police "sting" that used a female acquaintance as bait and 
a hidden camera to record evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 53, led into court past a crowd of reporters and chanting supporters, 
entered no plea during the brief proceeding in which he was charged only with a 
misdemeanor and not a felony, which carries much heavier penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said the misdemeanor crack cocaine charge, based apparently on the 
amount of the drug involved, would carry a maximum possible penalty of one year 
in prison and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was released without having to post bail pending a hearing scheduled for 
Feb. 5 to set a possible trial date. As a condition for his bail, officials 
said he will have to take weekly drug tests beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During the brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson, Barry 
waived his right to a preliminary hearing, but his attorney said he will insist 
on a jury trial and will eventually plead not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Among the evidence presented at the hearing was an FBI statement that Barry had 
tested positive for cocaine use in both blood and urine tests taken after the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Barry has governed Washington for more than a decade as the powerful leader of 
its majority black community -- a man seemingly impervious to controversy that 
might have felled other men -- and had planned to announce this Sunday that he 
would run for a fourth term. His staff said that announcement has been placed 
on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Thursday night in a hotel about six blocks from the White House 
in a room rented by FBI agents and, according to an FBI affidavit filed in 
court, bought crack cocaine there from a female acquaintance while a hidden 
camera clicked away. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor appeared calm although grim as he made his way out of the U.S. 
District Courthouse through a pressing crowd of reporters. He did pause long 
enough to deliver one of his patented cool dismissals of the latest controversy 
clouding his future. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not comment in substance on the case because it is still 
before the court, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to leave here and go about the business of government."

Two young Vietnamese refugees facing forced repatriation entered the U.N. 
office at their detention camp today and attempted suicide by disembowelment, a 
U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, believed to be in their 20s, entered the office carrying some kind of 
sharp objects, apparently knives, and stabbed themselves in the stomach, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
They were rushed to a hospital. Government-funded radio said one man was 
discharged and the other was in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at the Whitehead detention center, one of several camps 
housing a total of 44,000 boat people who face repatriation against their will 
unless they can prove they fled political persecution in their homeland and not 
just economic hardship.

An army colonel, three lieutenants and five enlisted men were charged with 
murder today in the November slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper 
and her teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Penal Court ordered the eight defendants in 
custody held for trial on charges of murder with "premeditation and perfidy," 
which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years, according to court secretary 
Nicolas Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The ninth suspect deserted from the army in December and is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72-hour deadline that began Tuesday 
when the prisoners, who have been under arrest since early January, were put at 
the disposition of the court. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means there is enough evidence to make a case against the 
defendants. The ruling begins a 120-day period during which the case is 
prepared for trial, but this investigation phase can be delayed by motions. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Guillermo Benavides, director of the Military College, is the 
highest-ranking armed forces officer to be accused of a crime involving human 
rights abuse in the 10-year-old civil war against leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The slain Jesuits were educators at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American 
University, one of the region's top colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The killings shocked El Salvador and the world and prompted calls in the 
Congress for reappraisal of the $1.5 million a day that Washington supplies in 
U.S. economic and military aid to this small Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
No military officer has been convicted before of a crime linked to human rights 
abuses, even though rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated by the armed 
forces killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The Jesuits and the two women were slain in their campus home Nov. 16, five 
days after the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas launched 
their biggest offensive of the war. 
</P>
<P>
The far right had long accused the Jesuits of being subversive ideologues 
because they publicly argued that the civil war was the result of gross social 
injustice rather than a Communist attempt to seize power.

Candy Jones, a top cover girl of the 1940s and the highest-paid model of her 
time, died Thursday of cancer at 64. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first model to earn $35 an hour -- considered an astounding fee in 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
She was also first to be featured on the covers of 11 national magazines at 
once, and she served as the model for a World War II postage stamp honoring 
women in the Navy and Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, blue-eyed blonde won the Miss Atlantic City beauty contest when she 
was 16. One prize was a trip to New York, where she was hired by the Conover 
modeling agency. She later married its founder, Harry Conover. The marriage 
ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Jones married radio WMCA talk show host Long John Nebel in 1972 and both served 
as co-hosts on a late-night show. She continued on the show after his death in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years she was owner-operator of Candy Jones Career Girls School. She 
also wrote magazine articles and books on modeling, beauty and fitness.

BHAGWAN RAJNEESH DIES AT 58; HEADED ORE. COMMUNE

The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the guru who drew thousands of followers to central 
Oregon by preaching a blend of Eastern religion, pop psychology and free love, 
died today of heart failure, his spokesman said. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
Rajneesh, known as Osho Rajneesh in recent years, died at his commune in the 
southern city of Poona, where he had lived since being deported from the United 
States in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Osho left his body at 5:30 p.m. The doctors say it's heart failure," spokesman 
Swami Kirti said. Disciples carried Rajneesh's body on their shoulders to a 
funeral pyre built on a nearby riverbank, and it was cremated, Kirti said. 
</P>
<P>
As the bhagwan, a Hindi word for god, Rajneesh presided over a 64,000-acre 
commune in central Oregon from 1981 until 1985, when he pleaded guilty to 
violating federal immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, the commune known as Rajneesh Puram was home to 4,000 red-clad 
followers who toiled for 12 hours a day and showered Rajneesh with jewels and 
Rolls-Royces that he used for daily drives past lines of singing, clapping 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of nearby communities resented the intrusion, and Rajneesh's top aide 
was eventually convicted in an elaborate scheme designed to gain political 
control of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Rajneesh pleaded guilty to immigration charges in 1985 and under a plea 
agreement received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine, and 
agreed not to return to the United States for five years without the written 
permission of the U.S. attorney general.

AB Bofors, Sweden's biggest weapons producer, said today it will cut its work 
force by 500 employees because of falling orders from the Swedish military. 
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a reduction last October by 1,300 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bofors had counted on continued orders from India, but they were suspended amid 
allegations that Bofors paid bribes to secure a $1.3-billion artillery sale in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the number of Bofors employees will be cut to about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Borje Johanson said Bofors had hoped Sweden's military would 
place about $200 million in orders, but "we have heard nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Johanson said Bofors' problems are linked to the military's dwindling funds for 
new armaments and to politicians' reluctance to allocate more money at a time 
of international detente.

Japan should continue to ban rice imports, the trade minister said today, 
reversing comments he made Thursday that the ban violated the spirit of free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's refusal to import any rice at all cannot be understood abroad and 
contradicts GATT's (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) goal of a free 
trading system," Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Hikaru 
Matsunaga said in Tokyo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But today Matsunaga said Japan should continue its ban on rice imports to 
maintain self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he made his earlier comments to explain how difficult it is to 
reach an agreement on the agricultural trade issue outside Japan and that he 
did not mean Japan should liberalize its rice market. 
</P>
<P>
Matsunaga's comments Thursday spurred considerable criticism in Japan, 
especially within his own party, the ruling Liberal Democrats.

A state appellate court today overturned the murder convictions of three former 
executives in the work-related death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Cook County Circuit Court verdict against executives of Elk Grove 
Village-based Film Recovery Systems Inc. was believed to be the first in which 
corporate officials were convicted of murder charges in a job-related death. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court ruled that the convictions on charges of murder, 
involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct were "irreconcilable" because of 
the different mental states required for such findings, said defense attorney 
Elliot Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has opened the door for a new prosecution," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Golab, 61, a Polish immigrant who worked at the plant where cyanide was 
used to recover silver from used X-ray film, collapsed at work after 
complaining of dizziness and nausea in 1983. His death was attributed to 
cyanide poisoning from inhaling fumes on the job.

An organization that represents airline passengers today called for a $1 levy 
on all air tickets to finance a $1-billion program to improve airline security 
and fight terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Lipman, secretary-general of the International Foundation for Airline 
Passengers, said such a fund would contribute toward research into more 
sophisticated security technology and improved training of airline staff, 
particularly in Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a survey by the foundation that showed that 80% of travelers 
questioned would support such a charge on tickets. The proposed fund would 
supplement existing security expenditures by governments and airlines, Lipman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, add $5 to the cost 
of a transatlantic ticket to cover security screening for international 
flights.

ABC TAKING CHANCES THAT MAY TRANSFORM IT INTO NETWORK OF '90S; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: UPCOMING SERIES TAKE THE TYPES OF RISKS THAT IN THE PAST HAVE 
CHANGED THE FACE OF THE MEDIUM.

<P>
It may still be closer to No. 3 in the ratings than No. 1, but ABC is starting 
to look more and more like the network of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
While top-rated NBC has enough creative and ratings steam to stay on top for 
another season, ABC is the network taking the kind of creative risks that 
change the face of television, the kind of risks once associated with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Critics are responding enthusiastically to several new ABC series slated for 
the second half of the 1989-90 season and previewed recently during ABC's leg 
of the January press tour here. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most talked-about program is "Twin Peaks." A fascinatingly 
off-kilter mix of soap opera and mystery, the hourlong drama is the creation of 
feature-film director David Lynch ("The Elephant Man" and "Blue Velvet"). It 
debuts in March. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a small town in the Pacific Northwest where life is commonplace only on 
the surface, "Twin Peaks" stars Kyle MacLachlan as a highly unusual FBI agent. 
Often bizarre, always quirky, sometimes dark and cryptic yet surprisingly 
humorous, it is a show the likes of which viewers have never seen. Joining 
MacLachlan in a huge ensemble cast are Michael Ontkean, Peggy Lipton, Joan Chen 
and Piper Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's ABC's "Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
One would think it impossible to make a series about Elvis Presley that wasn't 
tacky or tabloid. But this unique half-hour focuses on the Elvis of the early 
'50s, not the bloated lounge lizard of later years. Michael St. Gerard 
("Hairspray") looks like a Nielsen knockout, a charmer as the young Elvis -- 
the shy boy who would be king. Filmed in Memphis, "Elvis" hiply mixes music and 
drama. It could be broadcast as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the widely held notion that this has been a season of safe rather 
than challenging programming, ABC Entertainment President Rogert Iger said, "We 
haven't felt at ABC that we've played it safe," pointing to such shows as "Life 
Goes On," which stars an actor with Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
But Iger does not, on the other hand, consider "Twin Peaks" or "Elvis" 
high-risk programming "in part because we have confidence in the programs and 
in part because we feel if we put these shows on and they do not succeed, we 
will have learned something." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, ABC has its share of conventional shows in the works, too: 
</P>
<P>
"Equal Justice," a one-hour series targeted for March, is an East Coast version 
of "L.A. Law" with a large, ensemble cast. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital News," an hourlong drama with Lloyd Bridges as the patriarchal 
editor-in-chief of a Washington daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Brewster Place," Oprah Winfrey's first prime-time series, is a half-hour 
dramatic spinoff of last season's miniseries, "The Women of Brewster Place." 
Winfrey not only stars, she is also executive producer. It's coming in April. 
</P>
<P>
"H.E.L.P." An hourlong drama about a Harlem fire, police and paramedic unit is 
due in March.

JAMES BROWN PRISON WORK RELEASE HELD UP BY SNAFU BETWEEN STATES

Imprisoned soul singer James Brown technically is eligible for a work release 
program today, but he won't be released because South Carolina authorities have 
questions about his Georgia sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in January he was sentenced in Georgia to a total of six years and three 
months, which was to run concurrently with his South Carolina sentence of six 
years and six months," Department of Corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to work release, our laws are different, and we have asked his 
attorney to get his Georgia status clear. We haven't heard back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 56, was jailed a year ago today for aggravated assault and failing to 
stop for police. He already was on probation for a guilty plea involving 
carrying an unlawful pistol and resisting arrest and a no-contest plea to 
possession of the hallucinogenic drug phencyclidine hydrochloride, or PCP. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I really don't have enough information to discuss what will 
happen," said Brown's lawyer, Buddy Dallas of Thomson, Ga. "It's just 
bureaucracy. The only way to complicate this any more is to get a third state 
involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, prison officials say they understand that Brown will not be 
eligible for parole in Georgia until 1992. If that is the case, he would not be 
eligible for work release in South Carolina until March.

Phoenix Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, vilified by some fans for having the 
NFL's highest ticket prices the past two seasons, has done something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwill announced a restructuring program Thursday that will cut the cost on 
55,911 seats and reduce the average ticket price to $30.77 -- down from $38 in 
1988 and $36.33 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the pricing format for the 1990 season will lower the average ticket 
price 15.5% with reductions from $5 to $25 per ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices will still range from $200 per game for 202 premium loge seats at 
the 50-yard line to $15 apiece for seats in the south end zone at 74,724-seat 
Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
But Bidwill said 9,201 premium seats have been eliminated so there are now 
43,000 tickets priced at $15 and $20 per game with about 10,000 of the new $20 
tickets located on the sidelines.

The San Francisco Giants have signed free-agent veteran catcher Gary Carter to 
a one-year contract, the club announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 35, is an 11-time All-Star selection and a career .265 hitter with 304 
home runs during 15 Major League seasons, but he suffered through a poor season 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carter hit just .183 with two home runs and 15 RBIs while playing in a 
career-low 50 games for the New York Mets in 1989. He was out much of the 
season with an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Contract terms were not released by the Giants. Last year, Carter's contract 
with the Mets was valued at $2.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Carter is a great asset for our ballclub," said Al Rosen, president and 
general manager of the National League champions. "We think he can still 
produce both offensively and defensively. He's a proven leader both on the 
field and in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaining Gary gives us another proven veteran at the catching position, which 
is something a number of clubs would like to have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After playing for the Mets and Montreal Expos, Carter returns to California, 
where he attended high school. He's a 1972 graduate of Sunny Hills High School 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to be a Giant," said Carter from his home in Palm Beach Gardens, 
Fla. "Since Al Rosen and (Manager) Roger Craig came to San Francisco, no team 
has been more committed to success. I've gotten used to being in a winning 
atmosphere the last several years, and I'm sure that will continue this year. 
We have an outstanding lineup, and I'm looking forward to making whatever 
contribution I can." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who ranks fifth on the all-time Major League list of games caught with 
1,823, was a member of the 1986 Mets team that won the World Series.

Don Shula, the winningest active coach in the NFL, has signed a three-year

CHICAGO MAY GET STADIUM WITH DOME

Gov. James R. Thompson and Mayor Richard M. Daley reportedly are backing plans 
for a new domed stadium to house the Chicago Bears and serve as a magnet for 
major political and sporting events, such as the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions that the Metropolitan Pier and 
Exposition Authority, which would build the dome, has hired lawyers and 
appraisers to examine a site a few blocks south of Soldier Field, current home 
of the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
While Bears President Michael McCaskey has resisted the idea of a domed 
stadium, he recently has modified his position, a move that has put plans for 
the new stadium in high gear, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to explore the dome and see what can be done to make it an 
exciting place to watch football," McCaskey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not wildly enthusiastic about it," he said. "But the politicians feel 
strongly that only a structure with a lid can be justified from a public 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Daley apparently have convinced McCaskey that a dome, located 
close to Chicago's McCormick Place convention center, is the team's only chance 
for a taxpayer-subsidized stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Tribune said that Thompson and Daley will downplay the Bears when they 
present the plans for a domed stadium to lawmakers in Springfield this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they will emphasize its attraction as a home for events like political 
conventions, the Super Bowl, or the NCAA's "Final Four" basketball playoffs.

The new John McEnroe, Mr. Nice Guy, smiles sweetly, talks politely with the 
umpire, even tells jokes. 
</P>
<P>
He kills with kindness yet once again brandishes a left-handed serve-and-volley 
game as lethal as it was when he ruled men's tennis in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe is not only a model of decorum these days, he's winning again, gliding 
easily into the round of 16 at the Australian Open today with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 
victory over fellow American Dan Goldie. 
</P>
<P>
A month shy of 31, McEnroe says he has realized at last that the temper 
tantrums that once fired him up now merely burn him out. 
</P>
<P>
As he looks ahead to his next match against Sweden's Mikael Pernfors on Sunday, 
and a possible quarterfinal meeting with Yannick Noah, McEnroe is trying to 
conserve his energy. 
</P>
<P>
If he gets past those two, he would probably meet defending champion Ivan Lendl 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the sort of situation where you have energy to burn in this weather," 
McEnroe said. "The heat can catch up to you at times." 
</P>
<P>
Not even hecklers and chatty fans in the record crowd of 21,028 could ruffle 
McEnroe, who displayed his full repertoire of shots and bounced around the 
court as if he were 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm controlling play, that's the main thing," said McEnroe, who 
hasn't dropped a set in three matches or given up more than three games in any 
set. "In the majors in the last few years, I've sort of gone out there flat -- 
that's suicide." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who has given up fewer games -- 15 -- than anyone in the men's draw, 
is easily in his best shape since winning his last Grand Slam titles, the U.S. 
Open and Wimbledon, in 1984. He's hoping to combine his old-time savvy with his 
new-found desire and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can just get to that point where I feel comfortable with myself 
physically . . . I feel like then all the other things just come out," McEnroe 
said. "They just sort of come out like sweat on your shirt. . . . You don't 
have to think about it too much." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe only briefly questioned the call, but the crowd got on him immediately, 
one heckler baiting him with a cry of "Prima donna -- come on, play tennis." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe quietly resumed play. 
</P>
<P>
When McEnroe later complained, correctly and mildly, about a press photographer 
standing too close to court, a fan yelled: "Come on, Johnny, be good." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe kept his temper in control. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot more people who seemed to talk a lot between the points," 
McEnroe said. "It was disconcerting for both of us. It was hard to concentrate 
at times. I thought I did a good job of keeping my cool." 
</P>
<P>
Another player who stayed composed, though she admitted to a case of jitters 
before her first Grand Slam center court match, was Australia's newest darling, 
18-year-old Rachel McQuillan. 
</P>
<P>
McQuillan, considered the best young Australian woman player since Evonne 
Goolagong 20 years ago, reached the round of 16 Friday night with a 6-2, 7-6 
(7-4) upset of eighth-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've broken through now," McQuillan said after beating a top-20 player 
for the first time. McQuillan entered the tournament ranked 54. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time defending champion Steffi Graf survived 39 errors today to defeat 
Soviet Leila Meskhi, 6-4, 6-1. (Story, C2.)

Bo Jackson likes to surprise people. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to play both football and baseball when almost everyone said it 
couldn't be done. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's returned to Auburn University to work toward his diploma even though 
his athletic prowess already earns him of millions of dollars each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time to come back for something I need and want to do," Jackson said 
Thursday during a news conference at Auburn's School of Human Sciences. "A lot 
of people would say that if they were in my position they wouldn't come back. 
Well, I'm not most people. People never expect what I do to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who is majoring in family and child development, found time to come 
back to school between careers with the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders and 
baseball's Kansas City Royals. He encouraged other athletes to follow his 
example. 
</P>
<P>
After completing an internship and correspondence courses this quarter, Jackson 
will be 23 credit hours away from completing requirements for his degree. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to continue working toward his diploma to keep a promise to his 
mother and because he wants to be the first in his family to receive a degree 
from a major university.
