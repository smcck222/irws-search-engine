REAGANS MAY BE IN FOR BIT OF A CULTURE SHOCK IN L.A. 
</P>

<P>
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. and Mrs. Reagan. "Welcome home" might sound nicer. 
But L.A. isn't quite the home you left. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles doesn't live, eat, pray, cheat, talk, dance or even drive quite the 
same anymore. The city is both glitzier and grittier, more self-assured and 
more desperate, than the Los Angeles you might have imagined in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Why, when you were inaugurated eight years ago today, Elizabeth Taylor and Cher 
still wore other people's perfume, you could still make it downtown from Santa 
Monica in 30 minutes flat, and half a million of today's Los Angeles residents 
still lived in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Moonlighting was still a labor term back in those days. Starlight still meant 
something besides limousine service. And pizza, for heaven's sake, still had to 
be red. 
</P>
<P>
It's been exactly eight years since you took your oath of office. Dickens was 
visionary when he wrote that it was the best of times and the worst of times. 
What he didn't realize was that sometimes the quality of the times depends on 
one's ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Yours, of course, is the very best. According to the trendy new 
book, "Clustering of America," Bel-Air is one of the "blueblood" neighborhoods 
-- home to magnates, millionaires and, of course, movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing studies show bluebloods are among the most avid users of 
Rolls-Royces, Irish whiskeys and foreign cruises. You might find it interesting 
to note that they are among the lowest consumers of American-made products like 
Tupperware, denture adhesives and Chevy Impalas. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who will tell you that the gap between rich and poor in Los 
Angeles has widened eight lanes since you left. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, unemployment is down since you took office. It was 4.4% this 
past November, down from 6.9% in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
And demographic studies show that the average household income has jumped in 
different communities all around town since 1980, some by nearly 90%. 
</P>
<P>
The 67.5% increase in Bel-Air means income there surged from $115,298 in 1979 
to $193,113 this year. The 62.9% increase in Watts means income there rose from 
$9,476 to $15,441. That means the amount of new money going into Bel-Air homes 
was 15 times that going into Watts homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Split-level economy" was the phrase used by a blue-ribbon City Hall committee 
last year when it was trying to describe the Los Angeles housing crunch. 
Hardest hit on housing are the very poor. Federal aid for low-income housing 
was cut 78% while you were in office. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 families are living in garages today. There's no count of how 
many were living in garages before you took the reins of government because no 
one was counting. And back then, the 56,500-square-foot mansion in Holmby Hills 
was only a twinkle in Candy and Aaron Spelling's eye. 
</P>
<P>
If they just had signs the way they did in the good old days when you drove 
into town, today, it would say Los Angeles, Pop.: 3,315,400. When you left, it 
was about 2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
But what's most different about Los Angeles today is its international flavor. 
We're a dramatic new center of international trade now, a "solid No. 2 to New 
York City," according to the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
You might have trouble recognizing that old neighborhood around the Civic 
Center. The big holes are for a new subway system you fought against called 
Metro Rail. And the 73-story steel tower now rising will be the city's tallest 
skyscraper, across from the sadly blackened grand old library. 
</P>
<P>
Koreatown and Little Tokyo are booming cities of their own today. Japanese 
companies own close to half of all downtown office space. Arco Plaza, the 
Bonaventure Hotel and Union Bank are Japanese-owned. Your critics will claim 
that's because of your huge deficit and your decision to let the dollar fall to 
improve the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
There are whole new neighborhoods of Salvadorans and Guatemalans since you 
lived here last. Talk to the people who live there and you'll find many of them 
give your foreign policies credit for bringing them here. They'll also thank 
you for signing the immigration reform bill that gave some, but not all, of 
them amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Today, nearly 60% of all children in Los Angeles Public Unified School District 
schools are Latino. Only 94,032, or 15.8%, are Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the attention paid to gang violence, murders last year were at the 
lowest level in a decade. That doesn't mean that people feel more secure. Far 
from it. Security alarm sales are booming in many parts of town while in other 
neighborhoods security grates are a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find more Los Angeles residents saying yes to drugs these days. Last 
year, the city officially beat out Miami as the drug seizure capital of the 
country. Narcotics officers seized 37,000 pounds of cocaine in 1988, compared 
to just 359 pounds in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find it tougher getting around without that Secret Service helicopter. 
"Rush hour" has become a contradiction in terms. (Officially, according to 
Caltrans, it now lasts 420 minutes a day.) Commuters develop strategies for how 
to get around. They exit the off-ramps and get back on. They whip down the 
shoulders, and wheedle their way back in. To many, a yellow light these days 
means floor it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, vehicles traveled 22.8 billion miles on Los Angeles County freeways. 
By 1987, it was up to 30.4 billion. State officials admitted just the other day 
that nobody knows exactly what to do about this. If things keep up like this, 
by the year 2010, you'll be averaging 11 m.p.h. on your way to work -- 20 
m.p.h. slower than the official clock says you drive today. 
</P>
<P>
Our whole culture is different nowadays. We're a little less Beach Boys and a 
little more Ruben Blades. The East Coast is copying our cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Ask people to name a chef on "Family Feud" back in 1981, chances are that 86% 
would have said Boy-ar-dee. Today, with half the Westside on a first-name basis 
with the guys in the toques, you're likely to hear "Wolfgang." 
</P>
<P>
You've always said that one of the things you missed in the White House was 
working with your hands. Well, there's lots of opportunity now to pump your own 
gas. Remember, you have to pay first. But just try to park your car some night 
without a valet taking your keys. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for ways to spend your new leisure time, consider ordering up 
a movie. Whereas less than 5% of Los Angeles homes had VCRs in 1981, 67% do 
now. There's a video rental store on every corner where there used to be a gas 
station. At least one enterprising video rental store will deliver -- with 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of new movie theaters in town. But you'll find many are 
subdivided into train-sized compartments. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping centers and supermarkets, while withering away in the inner city, have 
blossomed on the Westside. Look at Melrose Avenue. Back at the turn of the 
decade, anyone looking for heavy metal there probably wanted a sledgehammer. 
But then, that was before hair -- and trendy tortillas -- turned blue. 
</P>
<P>
When Harry S. Truman left the White House, he yearned just to walk down the 
aisle of one of those new supermarkets that had sprung up while he was waging a 
war and living in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
You might visit a supermarket when you have a chance. Little vegetables (and 
big bills) are in. And, miraculously, while you were gone, people figured out a 
way to put fresh orange juice in stores in the Big Orange without sending them 
to Florida first for reconstitution. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out, though. Stores are not always what they seem. What with merger 
mania, Safeway is now Vons (and sometimes Pavilions Place.) Bullock's and I. 
Magnin are really Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
There are some things you won't see around Los Angeles anymore. The original 
Brown Derby. Schwabs. A home in Santa Monica for under $400,000. The Rams. The 
urban wilderness of connecting trails that was supposed to be completed by now 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. After you slashed the budget for new federal 
parkland, what was to be the entrance to the park is now a cluster of 
townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
But some things never change. Tom Bradley is still mayor. The Marlboro man 
still presides over Sunset Strip. And you can still get a hot dog at Pink's.

INAUGURATION EVE: BUSH LAUDS FRIEND, MENTOR 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the eight years of the Ronald Reagan presidency at an end, George Bush, in 
a solemn and celebratory rite as old as the Republic, becomes the 41st 
President of the United States today. 
</P>
<P>
The President-elect spent 15 minutes Thursday with Reagan in the Oval Office, 
bidding a private farewell to the man, he said, "whose shoes are going to be 
pretty darn hard to fill." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be President if it wasn't for my teacher and my friend," said Bush 
of the 77-year-old Reagan, when the two spoke to senior staff members after 
their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Evinces Optimism 
</P>
<P>
As streets near the U.S. Capitol and the White House were blocked off and 
elaborate plans were completed for the transfer of power at the stroke of noon 
today, Bush evinced the optimism that so marked Reagan's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of sunny skies and brimming anticipation for the close of one era 
and the beginning of another. It was a day on which Reagan and Bush took care 
to keep the focus on the new team and on what lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel this: Our best days are yet to come," Bush told a group of 
youthful supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week of inaugural revelry, in full swing well before the 
swearing-in ceremony itself, Bush has mixed celebration with symbolism. He met 
with an array of visiting delegations including blacks, schoolchildren and the 
handicapped, and he keynoted banquets, music shows and testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
He has also dispensed some substance. In an interview with news agency 
reporters Thursday, he defended his decision to delay the resumption of 
U.S.-Soviet arms-control talks scheduled next month and indicated that he is 
not ready to commit the United States to a summit conference with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Soviets understand that my intention is not to drag my feet but to 
simply do a prudent reassessment," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that his inaugural address today on the western steps of the Capitol 
will be "broad and thematic." It will be, he said, "a broad appeal to the 
American people to pitch in and help. It will be an expression of satisfaction 
about how far we've come as a nation, and a recognition that we've got a long 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tends to Paper Work 
</P>
<P>
On his last day as vice president, Bush, 64, kept mostly to himself. In between 
a morning gathering with young supporters and a night-time appearance at an 
entertainment gala, Bush spent much of his time in his office tending to paper 
work, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He left the White House complex at 4:20 p.m., waving to workers at the windows 
of the Old Executive Office Building next door, and went to the stately 
Jefferson Hotel to visit his 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush. 
</P>
<P>
At the prime-time extravaganza later Thursday at the Washington Convention 
Center, Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle sang the "Star Spangled 
Banner" and clapped along with country music performers. The event, featuring 
some of the biggest names in show business, was televised by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
As the show closed, Bush took the stage and said to the crowd and the 
television audience: "I expect that every one of the other 40 presidents 
pledged in his mind and soul to represent all the people. Well, this 41st 
President-to-be feels exactly the same way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Attend Church Service 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans a quiet morning before he takes the oath of office. He intends to 
attend a church service and spend a few hours with the 21 family members 
gathered in Washington for the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
The President-elect, First Lady-to-be Barbara Bush, their daughter and four 
sons and spouses, and the Bushes' 10 grandchildren all moved on Wednesday into 
Blair House, the government guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue from the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, they will all move into the White House for a weekend of 
celebration, before the Bush children and grandchildren set out for their homes 
spread from Maine to Colorado and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Offering a peek at life inside the stately townhouse, Bush spokesman Alixe Glen 
said that a temporary playroom was strewn with coloring books, computer games 
and popcorn, and a courtyard had been turned into a parking lot for big-wheeled 
tricycles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Timed to the Second 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, the schedule for the inauguration has been timed to the second. 
Because the 35-word presidential oath that Supreme Court Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist will administer takes about 45 seconds to recite, the actual 
swearing-in is set to begin at 11:59:15 a.m. If the timing works to precision, 
the oath will be completed precisely at noon, the moment at which Reagan's term 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife plan to arrive at the White House shortly before 10:30 a.m. 
to have coffee in the Blue Room with President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and 
with Quayle and his wife, Marilyn. From there, Reagan and Bush are to ride 
together to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who will be a spectator at the swearing-in of his successor, is 
scheduled to leave the Capitol 45 minutes later by helicopter, head for Andrews 
Air Force Base and depart for Los Angeles International Airport and his new 
home in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, have deliberately 
kept a lower profile as inaugural events began unfolding during the week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defer to New President 
</P>
<P>
"The Reagans have felt that this is George Bush's inauguration and these events 
are his inaugural events," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview with news service reporters, Bush sought to stem 
speculation that he is planning to start his presidency with a bang by 
unveiling a package of new programs in the first 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't really apply" when a sitting vice president in sync with the 
outgoing Administration takes over the presidency, he said. The last time such 
a succession occurred was in 1836, when Martin Van Buren followed Andrew 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bush offered little hint of imminent significant changes, saying that 
he supports the Reagan Administration's recent decision to open talks with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and that he does not plan to begin immediate 
negotiations on the budget with Congress, which currently has Reagan's budget 
proposal. On the budget, he said he would not dispatch his negotiators until 
after he meets Tuesday with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush kept mostly out of the public eye on Thursday, Mrs. Bush was the 
center of attention at a special tribute at the Kennedy Center. An adjacent 
plaza on the banks of the Potomac River became a mob scene of mink coats and 
limousines as some 225 members of Bush's extended family joined thousands of 
invited guests in saluting the incoming First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush responded with her characteristic humor and nonchalance after she was 
feted in three separate theaters by the Houston and National Symphony 
Orchestras, the Mora Arriagas Mariachi Band, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band 
and the Gatlin Brothers, Bush's favorite country music group. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did this (in) one more theater, I think I'd roll over and die," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to look at me," said Mrs. Bush, whose matronly appearance is often 
contrasted with Nancy Reagan's attention to high fashion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Then . . . It's Over' 
</P>
<P>
With that, she stepped back from the microphone and pulled open the jacket of 
her royal blue suit. "Hair done, makeup, designer clothes," she pointed out. " 
. . . all this week. Then . . . it's over." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a final jibe at her husband, who had complained Wednesday about 
her constant nagging over details of their move into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're President-elect, every single American knows where you are every 
single day. Do any of you remember where George Bush was last week? He was 
fishing."

SOVIETS TO CUT TACTICAL NUCLEAR ARMS IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first such specific pledge by either superpower, the Soviet Union said 
Thursday that it will withdraw some tactical nuclear weapons from Central 
Europe along with the troops and tanks that it had previously promised to pull 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which is expected to fuel debate within the U.S.-led North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization over plans to modernize its short-range nuclear 
missiles, was made in Vienna by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
addressing the final session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. The text of his speech was distributed in full here by the official 
news agency, Tass. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister, elaborating on military cutbacks first announced 
by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the United Nations in New York last month, 
said: "While striving for the declared fundamental goal -- to end any foreign 
military presence and bases on the territories of other countries -- the Soviet 
Union will withdraw units with all their armaments, including tactical nuclear 
systems, from Central Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had said his country would unilaterally pull 50,000 troops and 5,000 
tanks out of Eastern Europe within two years, but Shevardnadze's was the first 
mention that the cutback included nuclear weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
Short-range or tactical -- sometimes also called battlefield nuclear weapons -- 
have a range of up to 300 miles and include nuclear-tipped artillery shells as 
well as missiles. They are not covered under terms of the 1987 Soviet-American 
agreement to eliminate ground-launched intermediate-range nuclear weapons -- 
those with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles -- worldwide. Nor are they part of the 
ongoing strategic arms reduction talks, which deal with intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, missiles launched by long-range submarines and aircraft, 
and long-range aircraft that carry nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Charles Redman in Washington and a North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization spokesman in Brussels welcomed Shevardnadze's announcement 
Thursday. But both also noted that the Soviets have not yet supplied details of 
the type and quantity of weapons to be removed and that NATO unilaterally has 
already been cutting the size of its nuclear stockpile in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Peace Offensive' 
</P>
<P>
While Shevardnadze did not reveal how many tactical nuclear weapons would be 
involved, or how many would remain in Warsaw Pact arsenals, his comments 
maintained the momentum of a Kremlin "peace offensive" that has appeared to 
leave the West scrambling to regain the moral high ground. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also announced a planned 500,000-man cut in the Soviet military at 
last month's U.N. meeting, and on Wednesday he said the defense budget is to be 
reduced by 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader has said that he wants to cut military spending to help solve 
serious economic problems at home, particularly shortages of food and other 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Although the military cuts announced so far are unilateral, the Kremlin is 
clearly looking for some response from the West. And that was certainly true of 
Shevardnadze's statements Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that "the tactical nuclear weapons issue is being actively debated," the 
Soviet official stressed that Moscow "is not modernizing its tactical nuclear 
missiles." 
</P>
<P>
"We unequivocally proceed from the premise that nuclear missile modernization 
is a step backward, not forward," he said, and he proposed that "talks on these 
weapons be started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATO Commitment Sought 
</P>
<P>
His remarks were seen as aimed at NATO generally and West Germany in 
particular. The United States and Britain are pushing for an alliance 
commitment to produce a new short-range nuclear missile to replace the aging 
Lance missiles based in West Germany. But the Germans are resisting, 
particularly in light of the overall reduction of East-West tensions since 
Gorbachev came to power. 
</P>
<P>
A NATO official in Brussels quoted by the Reuters news agency called 
Shevardnadze's statement a "propaganda gambit. . . . It seems aimed at our work 
(on modernization) which they know we have been looking at, and is intended to 
create more problems in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Redman, in Washington, made it clear that NATO will continue its modernization 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, NATO will continue to retain in Europe those up-to-date forces and 
the minimum number of nuclear weapons needed to maintain a strategy of 
deterrence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NATO maintains that it needs tactical nuclear weapons to counter an 
overwhelming superiority in conventional (non-nuclear) weaponry enjoyed by 
Warsaw Pact forces in Europe. As long as that imbalance lasts, NATO argues, it 
needs modern, short-range nuclear weapons as a last resort to stop an otherwise 
indefensible, all-out East Bloc ground assault. It refers to the nuclear option 
as "flexible response." 
</P>
<P>
According to a NATO assessment of the European balance of forces published last 
November, the Warsaw Pact enjoys a 3-2 advantage in manpower, a 3-1 advantage 
in battle tanks and artillery, and a 2-1 advantage in combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable debate over the figures even in the West, and the Soviets 
contend that they are at best misleading. Shevardnadze told the Vienna 
conference Thursday that "by the end of January, the Soviet Union and its 
allies will make public their numerical data on troops and armaments of the 
sides in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
A previous set of negotiations known as the Mutual and Balanced Forces 
Reduction talks remained stalled for most of their 15-year duration over 
disagreement on the basic numbers of forces on each side. But in Vienna this 
week, the foreign ministers of all 35 participating countries signed an accord 
that includes provision for new talks between the 16 NATO members and the seven 
Warsaw Pact countries aimed at reducing conventional weapons and troop levels 
across the continent. These talks are slated to begin March 9. 
</P>
<P>
With earlier failures clearly in mind, Shevardnadze warned Thursday that while 
"we do not ignore the importance of initial data, . . . figures should not 
become an obstacle to politics. Long and fruitless discussions on categories of 
armaments and methods for counting troops may clog up the talks." 
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the two sides coordinate "mutually acceptable quantitative 
'ceilings' on troops and armaments of the sides." 
</P>
<P>
"In present conditions," he added, "we shall also be able to coordinate 
verification measures which will give full confidence that the established 
limits on troops and armaments are observed." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ledogar, the chief U.S. negotiator named for the March talks, called 
Shevardnadze's speech "upbeat," but he also rejected the idea of any freeze in 
NATO's tactical missile modernization plan. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman in Brussels said that if Moscow's decision to withdraw 
tactical nuclear weapons "signals that, in this field also, the Soviets are now 
beginning to realize that their potential far exceeds legitimate requirements, 
we can only find such steps encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Redman noted, as did the NATO spokesman, that "The Soviet Union . . . is 
following NATO's lead. Since 1979, NATO has unilaterally reduced the size of 
its nuclear stockpile in Europe by 2,400 warheads. Today, NATO's stockpile of 
nuclear weapons is at its lowest level in 20 years. To date, NATO's unilateral 
reductions have not been matched by the Soviet Union, which maintains a larger 
number of modern nuclear systems in Europe than does NATO." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning Wednesday's announcement by Gorbachev about the planned reduction in 
the Soviet defense budget, Redman noted that the Kremlin's defense budget has 
never been revealed and said "a percentage of what -- we don't know what the 
starting point is." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "We welcome the announcement that, of the 10,000 tanks 
to be reduced, 5,000 will be 'physically liquidated,' with the remainder to be 
converted to other uses. Likewise, we note with interest Gorbachev's 
clarification regarding the removal of 5,300 of the most modern tanks in the 
Soviet arsenal within the overall reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's closing session of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe ended 27 months of what the Soviet foreign minister described as 
"intense, at times dramatic, and yet unprecedentedly purposeful and democratic" 
East-West dialogue. The 35-nation accord that was the result puts forth a 
sweeping definition of human rights to be protected, including freer travel and 
religious practice, environmental protection, and economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vienna accord is a landmark on the way to a fundamentally new Europe," 
Shevardnadze said. The meeting, he added, "shook the 'Iron Curtain,' loosening 
its rusted joints, piercing still more holes in it, and enhancing its 
corrosion. It warmed the Cold War channel with the swell of new currents. 
Europe may only welcome this."

FBI PROBES FRAUD IN FUTURES TRADING; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTORS MAY HAVE LOST MILLIONS IN MASSIVE CHEATING IN CHICAGO MARKETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Undercover FBI agents working in the noisy, frenetic trading pits of the 
world's two largest commodities exchanges have uncovered evidence of massive 
fraud that may have cost investors tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year investigation of futures transactions at the Chicago Board of 
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange came to light Thursday as FBI agents 
served subpoenas demanding six years of records covering millions of trades 
from the two exchanges and their internal auditing departments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, grand jury subpoenas were served on traders and others connected 
with the exchange as FBI agents fanned out through Chicago's pricey Gold Coast 
neighborhoods and North Shore suburbs, beginning late Wednesday and working 
until dawn Thursday. Traders who did not get subpoenas got the news in 
headlines in the morning Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Traders, brokers and commodities firms were asked for records, handwriting 
samples, fingerprints and photographs. Between 50 and 100 persons are believed 
to be targets of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged illegal activity uncovered in the investigation includes cheating 
of investors, manipulating trading losses for tax advantages and possible money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some traders allegedly charged customers more for their contracts 
than they actually paid for them on the trading floor, and then pocketed the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
This and other complex schemes were uncovered in the arcane, little-policed, 
widely utilized financial markets where trades worth hundreds of billions of 
dollars a day are consummated on behalf of investors around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Legal sources said they believe the grand jury will consider charges that 
include racketeering, conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud and various income tax 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation came right out of the blue," an attorney representing a 
subpoenaed trader said. "No one knew anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, top Justice Department officials had known about it since last 
Friday, when Anton J. Valukus, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of 
Illinois, flew to Washington and briefed Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the inquiry is far-reaching and may ultimately involve tens of 
millions of dollars in fraud, some Chicago lawyers who specialize in 
commodities law cautioned that it is too early to compare the unfolding story 
here to the insider-trading scandal that has engulfed Wall Street for nearly 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there has been a perception in Chicago that these markets were ripe for 
a major scandal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchange Called 'Cesspool' 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen called the Chicago Board 
of Trade "a cesspool . . . rife with potential corruption and manipulation." 
Aspen sounded his warning as he sentenced a former trader to six years in 
prison for a $300,000 trading scam that involved wearing disguises to escape 
identification on the trading floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Problems like these have been with the exchanges from the very beginning," 
said Robert Tamarkin, a futures market historian and president of Intermarket 
Publishing Corp. "These markets can only be regulated by having a policeman in 
each pit. This is an example of the failure of self policing and shows the 
weakness of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating the pits." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the alleged illegal activity was documented on tape recordings made by 
at least five FBI agents. They wore concealed electronic monitoring equipment 
as they worked in the noisy, bustling trading pits -- literally depressions in 
the trading floor -- where all deals are settled by shouts and complex hand 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI moles were placed in some of the busiest trading areas of the two 
exchanges. At the Board of Trade, agents worked in the soybean pit, often 
crowded with hundreds of traders and particularly busy as the result of last 
summer's drought, and also in the heavily traded U.S. Treasury bond pit. At the 
Mercantile Exchange, undercover agents traded foreign currencies and the 
Standard &amp; Poor's Index. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of the federal investigation is suggested in the subpoenas delivered 
Thursday afternoon. The grand jury demanded "all records relating to membership 
and trading activity for the period Jan. 1, 1983, to the present, including but 
not limited to trade registry records, time and sales records, disciplinary 
files and complaints, membership background and financial stock-holding 
investigation file." 
</P>
<P>
The government has asked for literally millions and millions of records. In 
1988 alone, at the Chicago Board of Trade a record 143 million futures 
contracts were traded -- fully half of all futures contracts traded in the 
world. Last year's volume at the Mercantile Exchange was 78 million contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exchanges to Cooperate 
</P>
<P>
In a notice to its members, the Board of Trade said that it "must and will 
comply fully with this subpoena." A spokesman for the Board of Trade said he 
expects federal agents to begin inspecting the data at the board offices as 
soon as next week. A spokesman for the Mercantile Exchange said it too would 
cooperate with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
While word of the federal grand jury inquiry swept the trading floors and 
Chicago's financial community -- second only to New York's in size -- both 
Justice Department and FBI officials refused to confirm or deny that there was 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The position of my office and of the FBI here is absolutely no comment," said 
U.S. Atty. Valukus, who for months has been warning, in public statements, of a 
federal crackdown on commodities trading fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities in Washington were also uncharacteristically reluctant to 
discuss the investigation even privately Thursday, apparently in an effort to 
reduce the impact it might have on the markets that affect trading worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the investigation made its mark. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the 
price of a membership fell $35,000 Thursday, to $410,000 from $445,000. And, at 
the Mercantile Exchange, the price of a full seat plunged $20,000 to $330,500. 
</P>
<P>
One lawyer said a client had told him that there were suspicions in late 1987 
that the FBI was investigating the Board of Trade. "They didn't know the extent 
but they knew there was something going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kaleidoscope of Confusion 
</P>
<P>
Despite a small army of security men who patrol the floors of both exchanges 
looking for improprieties, trading takes place in an atmosphere conducive to 
shady dealings. Together, the two exchanges have over 6,000 traders and 
hundreds of clerks, runners, telephone clerks and messengers -- all identified 
by the colors of their jackets. The trading floors are a kaleidoscope of 
confusion and color in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities ranging from soybeans and corn to foreign currencies and Treasury 
bonds are traded at the two exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
A futures contract is an agreement to deliver a quantity of a commodity at a 
specific time for a set price. For example, if a major grain company believes a 
drought next summer will raise the price of corn, it might buy corn now for 
July delivery -- at a price it believes is lower than next summer's price will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Similar contracts allow investors and speculators to buy everything from 
plywood and live cattle to soybeans and gold. Although some trades are made 
with the intention of actually taking delivery of the commodity, most are paper 
transactions with investors and speculators hoping to make money from quick, 
minute swings in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities futures traders are to Chicago what Wall Street brokers are to New 
York and what entertainers are to Hollywood. They have a reputation for glitz, 
living in the fast lane, enjoying the high life. 
</P>
<P>
Traders provide the grease that helps run Chicago. Profits earned in the 
trading pits build restaurants and fuel limited partnerships that erect 
high-rise apartments and office buildings. Some of the city's most valuable 
private art collections are owned by traders.

ESCALATING HATE REPORTEDLY CONSUMED GUNMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Edward Purdy, who this week attacked a school playground with a 
military rifle, killing five Southeast Asian refugee children and himself, was 
consumed by an indiscriminate and apparently escalating hatred for all people, 
police officials and others familiar with the troubled young drifter said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While Purdy was known to make surly comments about the Southeast Asian refugees 
flooding into this San Joaquin Valley town, a police investigator said it 
appeared race played no role in Purdy's selection of targets for his Tuesday 
attack in which 30 people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hatred for everybody," Capt. 
Dennis Perry, head of investigations for the Stockton Police Department, said 
Thursday. " . . . Whoever he happened to be talking about, he didn't like. He 
disliked not just one race, but all races." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said Purdy had "problems" with abuse of alcohol and marijuana. Court 
records indicated that Purdy twice attempted suicide in 1987 after being jailed 
for firing a pistol in the woods near Lake Tahoe. Found among his possessions 
then was a racist manual on guns and killing, and a psychological counselor 
described Purdy as "a hazard to himself and others." 
</P>
<P>
At Cleveland Elementary School, where the counselor's prophecy was realized 
Tuesday in Purdy's apocalyptic, four-minute attack, children were being guided 
gently through the psychic trauma. Officials said 674 of the school's 940 
students were back in class Thursday, still isolated from most outsiders and 
undergoing grief counseling by more than 100 doctors, psychologists and 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
School official John Klose likened the atmosphere at Cleveland Elementary to an 
"emergency room." 
</P>
<P>
"We have some healing going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators hold out little hope of pinpointing what provoked Purdy's assault 
on the school, which he attended from kindergarten through second grade. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never know everything because he didn't leave us a message or a note," 
Perry said. " . . . In a way, he beat us because he did not tell us why he did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
While the precise motive remained a mystery, the dark patterns in Purdy's life 
that led toward his one-man invasion of the elementary school were clear 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators, co-workers, relatives, teachers and acquaintances all 
painted essentially the same portrait. It was the portrait of a loner with a 
troubled past and sometimes-violent tendencies, a young man who was unwilling 
to accept authority, was prone to self-delusion, filled with self-loathing and 
fascinated by weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
In the neighborhood of tract homes where he lived as a boy, about half a mile 
from the schoolyard where he ended his life, Purdy was recalled as a child who 
once ran down the street with a large kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Cappalla, who still lives around the corner from Purdy's former home, 
remembered how Purdy, then 8, objected when he disarmed him. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You can't take that. It's my mother's,' " he quoted Purdy as saying. "I 
said, 'If your mother wants it, she can come and get it.' She never did." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy's family moved from Stockton when he was in third grade, eventually 
settling at Lake Tahoe. Purdy was placed in a continuation high school for low 
achievers, and teachers there Thursday remembered him well. 
</P>
<P>
"He never hung around with girls or other students," said Michael Makely, a 
teacher at the Mt. Tallec school. "In fact, you never saw him with other human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a loner. He'd sit in class wearing his big green Army fatigue jacket, 
and he wouldn't participate. I think he felt inadequate. He was so withdrawn. 
Looking back on it, we think he was sniffing glue or smoking dope because he 
was real spacey. . . . I am not surprised this was the kid that did this 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Along Stockton's Skid Row, Purdy was known as someone who tried to persuade 
people that he had served in Vietnam and who boasted of having bought a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy apparently would take rooms in Skid Row hotels in between job-finding 
journeys to cities across the United States. Police detectives have built a 
long list of former Purdy employers and recipients of his job applications. 
People who worked with him remembered Purdy for his bad attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"He expressed hatred, anger and bitterness at just about anybody who asked him 
to do anything," said Steve Sloan, 29, who worked with Purdy on the night shift 
for a month at a machine shop here. "Every time you tried to explain something, 
he looked like he wanted to jump on you." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy's scrape with the law in Lake Tahoe, one of several relatively minor 
criminal incidents found on his record, occurred 16 months ago in Camp 
Richardson on the southern end of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies who responded to the sound of shooting found Purdy with a 9-millimeter 
pistol. Told his gunplay was illegal, Purdy became defiant. 
</P>
<P>
"He started talking about how it was his duty to help the suppressed and to 
overthrow the suppressor," an officer's report on the incident stated. "He then 
stepped back and closed his hand in a fist and took up a fighting stance." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy, the officer reported, raged further that "he was no longer going to be 
pushed around. He talked about how he would kill anyone who pushed him around 
and how it was his right." 
</P>
<P>
Detained in the jail drunk tank, Purdy ripped off his shirt and attempted to 
employ it as a noose. Later, he tried to cut his wrists with his finger and 
toenails, according to sheriff's records. 
</P>
<P>
He was then transferred to an El Dorado County mental health unit for 
observation but was eventually released. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy was receiving federal disability payments for what a Social Security 
official termed "some type of mental impairment." It was not clear when he 
began receiving the payment or for what reason. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the powerful AK-47 assault rifle Purdy purchased in Oregon and 
wielded at Cleveland Elementary, investigators have turned up at least five 
other weapons purchases by him in the past five years. Almost all were for 
semiautomatic pistols, including the one he used Tuesday to take his own life 
on the school playground. 
</P>
<P>
All the weapons purchases were legal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if, given Purdy's past brushes with law, Stockton police might have been 
made aware of the menace he posed prior to the Tuesday attack, Perry, the 
Stockton police captain, said: "I don't think so. He had some criminal history 
but a lot less than an amazing number of people who are running around on the 
streets today." 
</P>
<P>
The Stockton Unified School District, meanwhile, sent out letters to the homes 
of all students Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Children," the letter read, "please call your friends and encourage them to 
come back to school. Your teachers care about you and wish to help you learn. 
They want to see you again." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have established a 24-hour hot line monitored by therapists 
fluent in English, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Lao and Hmong. Stockton's Cambodian 
community plans a mourning service to be held next week. Most of Cleveland's 
students are Southeast Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
At the front of the school, parents and passers-by left more flowers and 
stuffed animals Thursday. Teachers brought classes to a school sign there to 
offer brief prayers. 
</P>
<P>
After bowing her head with classmates, Keo Hem, 12, a sixth-grader who 
emigrated from Cambodia in 1983, said a silent prayer. Her prayer, she told a 
reporter later, was for "care for these children that have been hurt and to 
save other children from being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let them come and shoot again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 people wounded in the attack, eight children were in stable condition 
at hospitals Thursday night and six others, including a teacher, were in fair 
condition. The others have been released. 
</P>
<P>
As the school day ended, dozens of parents arrived to accompany their sons and 
daughters home. U.S. Army recruiting Sgt. Rick Roland, 35, had walked his sons 
Damien, 11, and Desmond, 8, to school Thursday morning to help them overcome 
their fear. 
</P>
<P>
"To show them that everything is OK now," Roland took the boys for a brief 
stroll around the playground where their classmates had been gunned down.

BOARD TO REVISE WATER PLAN IN BID TO SATISFY ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from urban Southern California and agricultural interests, 
the state Water Resources Control Board agreed Thursday to revise a 
controversial draft plan that was designed to improve water quality in the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The revisions will delay the court-ordered plan by at least six months as the 
water board's staff attempts to rewrite the proposal in a manner that will 
satisfy water users in the southern part of the state as well as Northern 
California environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some justifiable criticism of the draft report," W. Don 
Maughan, board chairman, said after the board's decision. "There is justifiable 
criticism that we haven't gotten all the input that we should." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the plan was to develop water quality standards for San 
Francisco Bay, which over the years has suffered increased pollution and a 
reduced flow of water due to the diversion of water from the delta to other 
parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But the initial draft proposal released last November generated considerable 
opposition because it called for limiting the amount of water shipped to 
Southern California to 1985 levels and imposing a strict program of water 
conservation as the population of the area continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, Maughan said, the next draft of the plan will not include 
recommendations for a limit on water exports to Southern California. Instead, 
the agency will turn to that thorny question in later discussions when it 
considers how to implement the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Maughan said he had always envisioned revising the plan after a lengthy series 
of public hearings. The original draft, he said, was simply a starting point 
for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal so angered farming interests and Southern California 
water importers that some critics of the plan began lobbying Gov. George 
Deukmejian not to reappoint Maughan when his 4-year term as board chairman 
officially expired last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Deukmejian has until March 14 to reappoint Maughan or name 
someone else to the post. Earlier this week, the governor said he had been too 
busy with other issues to focus yet on the appointment. "It's just something 
that hasn't really come up to me yet," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Maughan said the efforts to remove him had not affected the board's decision 
and that he had received no instructions from the governor's office on how to 
handle the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Maughan said, as the agency revises the plan it will continue to 
take into account environmental interests as well as the needs of agriculture 
and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there's a lot of pressure been brought to bear," Maughan said. "But I 
also think we're going to look at all these environmental issues equally as we 
are (those raised by) the water industry." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to set water quality standards for San Francisco Bay are certain to 
continue to be controversial. Environmentalists and fishing interests are 
seeking increased flows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems to 
provide an adequate habitat for fish and to flush pollution out of the delta 
and the bay. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, water suppliers to Southern California want to guarantee 
sufficient water for the region's burgeoning population and Central Valley 
farmers are determined to protect their water supply.

President Reagan, who failed in an attempt to name Robert H. Bork to the 
Supreme Court, appointed him Thursday to a group overseeing a history of the 
nation's highest judicial tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
One day before leaving office, Reagan announced the appointment of the former 
appeals court judge and solicitor general as a member of the Permanent 
Committee for the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise. 
</P>
<P>
The Devise is a congressionally authorized work on the history of the Supreme 
Court, based in part on the papers of Justice Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
In an action that Reagan has described as one of the most bitter 
disappointments of his presidency, the Senate on Oct. 23, 1987, rejected his 
nomination of Bork to succeed Justice Lewis F. Powell on the Supreme Court.

POLICE, CUBANS BLAMED FOR MIAMI RIOT;

OUTSIDE A NO NAME BAR BLACK ANGER STILL BOILS

<P>
On the corner where black outrage boiled over into violence Monday, the people 
still are angry. 
</P>
<P>
"They be shooting us down like dogs, like it's hunting season," said a 
longshoreman named Lorenzo Anthony Brown. "The police, they judge and try us on 
the spot." 
</P>
<P>
The men started to gather before noon Thursday, just as they do every day, in 
front of the dingy corner bar with no name. 
</P>
<P>
They were drinking beer and telling stories. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this scar here on my head," began one. "Let me tell you how I got 
this." 
</P>
<P>
"We were just standing here -- I had a beer -- and I looked over and saw a cop 
car pull up," began another story about something that happened long ago. The 
listeners all knew what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
These men had been there, on the corner, when a Latino police officer shot and 
killed a black motorcyclist Monday during a chase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Died Instantly 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist died instantly, sparking three nights of rioting and looting. 
A passenger died Tuesday from injuries suffered when the motorcycle ran into a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
When Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez came to the corner Monday and started to talk to 
the angry crowd, bottles and rocks began to fly. 
</P>
<P>
"He was here about an hour," Brown said. "He asked us what could he do to calm 
the people down. I told him to give us a reason for the cops shooting us down 
in cold-blooded murder." 
</P>
<P>
"It was crowded down here, everybody was happy," recalled another man of the 
scene Monday night before the shooting. "Everybody was having a good time and 
enjoying themselves, enjoying Martin Luther King's birthday, until it 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The black communities of Overtown, where the shooting occured, and Liberty 
City, have not been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
The police are counting on a massive show of firepower to quell the unrest. The 
entire Overtown community was surrounded by police barricades Thursday for the 
second straight day. Police continually patrolled the areas where the most 
violence erupted. Some of their cars had cracked windshields, the result of 
earlier confrontations with rioters. 
</P>
<P>
Bond hearings were held Thursday for 200 of the nearly 400 people who have been 
arrested so far. Police Sgt. Michael Mazur said things had quieted down 
somewhat Wednesday night because the courts "kept 250 dirtbags in jail. They 
didn't release them." 
</P>
<P>
But while looting and violence have diminished since Monday, the outrage that 
sparked them has not gone away. 
</P>
<P>
Overtown is a dismal place. A once-proud community, the neighborhood -- which 
originally was called Colored Town -- is full of boarded up buildings, 
garbage-strewn vacant lots, drugs, anger and despair. 
</P>
<P>
Just a block from the corner where the men congregated sit double rows of 
shotgun shacks. One of them had been gutted by flames. An old man sat on the 
porch of the house next door, a half-empty bottle of cheap champagne by his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
No, he said, the fire had not been started by the rioters. "Them dope addicts 
did it. They were living there. And I got dope addicts living on the other side 
of me, and in back of me, too. I complain, but they don't put them out." 
</P>
<P>
The stories the men on the corner were telling Thursday were as ugly as the 
surroundings -- tales of indignities suffered, large and small, that might make 
a man want to pick up a brick. 
</P>
<P>
"What I wanna know is how come it's always the Cubans that's shooting the 
niggers," shouted one man, a retired city health worker wearing a pin-striped 
suit over an open-collar shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cubans will shoot a nigger faster'n a cracker will," said another man, a 
former police officer who dominated the talk. "It's the banana republic 
mentality," he added. The others nodded agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Miami is Ronald Reagan and Oliver North giving funds to the 
Contras, stirring all that unrest," said the former policeman, Dan Washington. 
"Now the people can't stay in Nicaragua; they want to get away . . .. When they 
get to the United States, big as it is, Miami is where they come. And Suarez is 
there to meet them at the bus station, just about. 
</P>
<P>
"He's telling them: 'You want to come live in our stadium? You need jobs? Never 
mind the niggers sleeping in the streets -- just step right over them.' "

Riot police beat protesters with clubs Thursday and formed human cordons to 
drive 2,000 people from Wenceslas Square, where activists demanding more human 
rights have rallied five straight days. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10 were dragged 
away by police during a melee that broke out after authorities shouted through 
loudspeakers that the rally was unauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most violent clash between protesters and police since the 
gatherings began Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms in the 
Communist-ruled nation, but those slogans changed to "Gestapo! Gestapo!" when 
the baton-wielding wave of riot police swept through, lashing out 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
Officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protesters out of the 
square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor's Television Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vdenek Horcik appealed for the "provocations" to stop. Speaking on 
national television, Horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young people off 
the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd assembled shortly after 5 p.m., when many Prague residents were on 
their way home after work. They shouted "Free Havel!" and "Let them go!" 
referring to human rights activist Vaclav Havel and 14 others jailed for taking 
part in earlier protests. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of officers poured into the half-mile-long square from side streets 
when the protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd and pushing them along 
the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to help force away the 
demonstrators. Water cannon were brought onto the square but not used. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations began Sunday when about 5,000 people gathered at Wenceslas 
Square for a memorial to Jan Palach, who burned himself to death 20 years ago 
to protest the presence of Soviet troops after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's Name Invoked 
</P>
<P>
Troops and tanks sent in by the Kremlin in August, 1968, crushed the Prague 
Spring reforms, which now are likened to the social and economic changes 
championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some protesters yelled "Gorbachev sees this!" when police moved in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, a member of the 
Charter 77 human rights group, was denied permission to visit West Germany for 
the 75th birthday of his friend, former Chancellor Willy Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
Hajek, who was allowed to visit Austria last month, said Prague authorities 
deemed it against state interests for him to travel abroad.

SAKHAROV REJECTED AS CANDIDATE FOR NEW PARLIAMENT

Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov has been rejected by the 
Academy of Sciences as one of its representatives in a revamped Soviet 
Parliament, a fellow academy member said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, 67, physicist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was turned down along 
with several other leading scientific and cultural figures at a marathon 
12-hour meeting of the academy's Presidium that ended late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was enormous support for Sakharov among the rank and file of the 
academy," said Roald Sagdayev, director of the Soviet Space Research Institute. 
"I do not know how the Presidium is going to explain it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Sagdayev, who also failed to win nomination, said, "If I had to summarize those 
not elected, I would say it is the group of the most outspoken proponents of 
perestroika (restructuring). I am proud to be in such company." 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency Tass said that Sakharov won 105 votes, failing 
to reach the required minimum of 139. 
</P>
<P>
The academy and other public bodies such as the ruling Communist Party and 
trade unions are together allocated one-third of the seats in the Congress of 
People's Deputies, a new supreme legislative body to be created in March.

SHAKEN JUDGE LETS MOTHER PREVENT BOY'S SURGERY

<P>
A judge, forced to decide the fate of a dying 12-year-old by choosing between 
the boy's father and mother, sided with the mother Thursday in ruling that the 
youngster cannot be forced to undergo further surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Thomas J. O'Brien, who left the bench briefly when he became 
choked up, gave Yisroel Soloveichik's mother authority to determine the boy's 
medical treatment in accordance with doctors' recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added, however, the evidence was overwhelming that "both are loving 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, diagnosed two years ago as having brain-stem cancer, is on a 
respirator and is fed intravenously. He is unable to communicate or hear. 
</P>
<P>
His parents had sued each other over the father's request that the boy undergo 
a surgical procedure to relieve pressure on his brain by draining away fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Soloveichik, the boy's mother, and doctors had argued against such a 
move, citing the risk of pain and infection. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few winners in a case like this. This is a genuine tragedy if there 
ever was one," said Christopher Cohen, the mother's attorney. "The only winner, 
if there is one, is the boy, in that he will be allowed to die in comfortable 
surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Is Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
Moshe Soloveichik, 39, an Orthodox rabbi, was convinced that surgery might help 
his son and was disappointed by the ruling, said his attorney, Howard London. 
He added that no decision had been made on an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, where Yisroel has been 
hospitalized since diagnosis, said the boy probably has less than two months to 
live, and they could not guarantee that surgery would prolong his life. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father felt surgery "would prolong the boy's life without exposing 
him to any prolonged suffering," London said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's ruling specifies that life-support systems now in use are not to be 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither of the parents suggested withdrawing any existing life-support 
procedures. This is not what is colloquially called a 'pull-the-plug' case," 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case regarding heroic measures requested against medical advice, 
wherein pain and suffering would result to an irreversible terminally ill 
patient," he said after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The North Side couple, who have four other children and are still living 
together, filed lawsuits against each other last week.

EXECUTIVE SAYS FREEDOM HELPS -- BUT HURTS WHEN LAWBREAKERS ABOUND; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS SEE LOOSE TRADING RULES AS KEY PROBLEM 
</P>

<P>
The Chicago futures markets, the site of the FBI's massive fraud investigation, 
are a noisy, bruising world, where only the quick-witted endure, and fortunes 
can be made or lost within hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, like their 10 
sister commodity exchanges, boast that the freedom they give traders makes them 
"the last bastion of unfettered capitalism." But some critics maintain that the 
Chicago markets' loose rules leave them vulnerable to lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's freedom that keeps the markets ticking, but freedom hurts us, too, when 
there are unscrupulous people around," said an executive of a big futures 
trading company in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The traders who swarm the small amphitheaters called the "pits" are not 
actually buying or selling any product today, but rather are promising to do so 
at a specified future date at a specified price. 
</P>
<P>
The futures markets sprang up in the era of Andrew Jackson as a means for 
farmers to reduce the risk that prices for their crops and livestock would 
collapse before they got them to market. 
</P>
<P>
They would strike deals to sell hundreds of bushels of corn at a certain price 
after the harvest -- ensuring them a good price. As this deal-making caught on, 
Chicago city slickers saw they could get rich if they could correctly guess 
which way prices were moving, even though they didn't have any inventory of the 
grain or livestock. 
</P>
<P>
For example, these traders might strike a deal to sell 100,000 bushels of corn 
at $2.50 a bushel on, say, Sept. 1. If the price for a Sept. 1 corn contract 
rose to $2.60 a bushel the next day, the trader could sell his contract 
immediately, and walk away with a $10,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the price fell to $2.40, he would be out $10,000 just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
(And it isn't just the thickheaded who can lose their shirts. Leo Melamed, 
chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's executive committee, went 
bankrupt in the pits as a youth, before making back his losses and amassing a 
fortune.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guessing Price Trends 
</P>
<P>
The lure of such money attracted dozens of these so-called commodity futures 
traders, who set up permanent shop in huge bustling halls in Chicago, buying 
and selling contracts for corn and wheat, soybeans and beef, pork bellies 
(bacon) and other commodities. They learned that they could make money by 
guessing the trend of prices, whether it was up or down. 
</P>
<P>
While some critics damned them as speculators, the traders argued that they 
provided an essential economic service. They allowed farmers to shift the risk 
of fluctuating prices to traders, who were willing to bear it because of the 
possible profits. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just farmers they were serving, but anyone who owned a large 
quantity of a commodity and wanted to reduce their risk -- or "hedge" -- 
against a price decline. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit auto makers, for example, trade millions of dollars in copper futures 
contracts to hedge their huge risk in that metal, which they use to build each 
auto. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the futures markets have boomed as the agricultural 
commodities have been joined by more exotic "financial futures," such as 
contracts on the prices of Treasury bills and bonds, currencies and stock-index 
futures. Also booming recently has been trading in contracts for oil, which 
have been swapped in rapidly growing numbers since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Traders in these contracts don't actually deliver these investments at the 
specified dates. Rather, they square their winnings or losses in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, making these bets allows investors to reduce their risk that prices 
will go against them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can trade futures contracts on anything, as long as it has a day-to-day 
use, worldwide interest and fluctuating prices," said Neil McGarity, a 
spokesman for the Futures Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the volume of contracts has been growing at 20% a year in the 1980s, 
at both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
commonly called the Merc. 
</P>
<P>
This boom has meant that in recent years, as some other parts of Chicago's 
business world have withered, the futures business has picked up some of the 
slack. There are now 100,000 people directly employed by the futures exchanges, 
and hundreds of others whose jobs indirectly depend on them, according to Merc 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
For generations, young Chicagoans, often from working-class backgrounds, have 
headed to the pits to earn their living. 
</P>
<P>
They take jobs as "traders," who trade for their own behalf, or "brokers," who 
carry out trades for others. An exchange member can perform both functions. 
</P>
<P>
But making a fortune there is not easy work. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where a "specialist" directs the trading of 
each stock, at the pits each participant is free to make his own deals by 
continuously calling out their buying or selling price. This "open outcry" 
system ensures a constant din in the pits, since there may be hundreds of 
traders and brokers looking for buyers or sellers at any given moment. Traders 
often seal their deals by means of hand gestures, to make sure they understand 
someone they may not hear well. 
</P>
<P>
The pits are bruising places, for traders are always jockeying for the clearest 
view of the rest of the pit. Traders are routinely elbowed, jabbed, tossed onto 
the floor. Sometimes, though rarely, an excited trader throws a punch at 
someone who has gotten in his way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grueling Pace Takes Its Toll 
</P>
<P>
The routine of the trading life is so punishing that traders usually leave the 
most active pits after their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
The traders rave about the joys of this system, which allows someone with a 
stake of a few thousand dollars to try to make a fortune. But there are 
critics, too, who insist that the relatively loose rules of the pits opens the 
door to the kind of allegedly crooked trading practices that the FBI has 
focused on. 
</P>
<P>
One industry executive, asking that he remain unidentified, says he believes 
that trading floor abuses can creep in for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the chaos of trading, it is harder to keep track of whether a broker is 
getting his clients the best price for a contract. At any moment, there may be 
a wide range of prices called out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, players in the pits can be brokers and traders at the same 
time. This means that if, for example, they are holding a large order for a 
contract that is likely to drive the contract's price up or down, they may slip 
in their own order ahead of the client's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there is a potential for this kind of stuff," he said. "All we can do 
is tell our people to watch out for it." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the industry say the growing number of traders in the pits, and their 
quicker turnover, means traders don't know all those they see in the pits, as 
traders did in the old days. The Merc has 2,724 members now, for example, 
compared to 1,275 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say another weakness in the system is that traders keep track of their 
transactions by marking slips of paper that can be lost, falsified or 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Special Problems 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Klejna, enforcement director of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, the industry's chief regulator, acknowledged that the trading 
system creates special enforcement problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that it's not always easy to detect what's going on out in that 
very active situation," said Klejna, who declined to discuss the reported FBI 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of trading-floor abuses crop up regularly. In 1987, to counter 
allegations that some brokers failed to give customers the best price for a 
contract, the Merc reserved the top step of its S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures 
trading pit for members who executed orders for others but did not trade for 
their own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Board of Trade commodities trader Thompson B. Sanders was 
sentenced to six years in jail for masterminding a scheme in which a 
confederate wore a wig and a false ID badge in the market's Treasury bond pit. 
Sanders and five others used the disguises to duck out on unprofitable trades; 
they made $300,000 in profitable ones. 
</P>
<P>
And Thursday, the Merc announced it had imposed a fine of $750,000 -- its 
largest ever -- on a husband-and-wife trading team who had "prearranged" 
trades. The Merc did not provide further details of the infractions by the 
couple, Barry and Carlem Haigh, who were also expelled from the exchange.

READ BUSH'S LIPS, THEN CREDIT HIS YOUNG SPEECH WRITER

It is a singular twist to his political life that George Bush, the East Coast 
aristocrat and Texas oilman whose inner circle teems with older and upper-crust 
men, found his voice in the words of a working-class daughter, a woman little 
more than half his age. 
</P>
<P>
When he sought to herald his campaign for the presidency, to break from the 
shadow of vice presidential anonymity, George Bush turned to Peggy Noonan. When 
his campaign reeled in New Hampshire, its keel shattered by a dismal showing in 
Iowa's caucuses, Bush turned to Noonan. When Democrats were sizing themselves 
up for White House jobs and he reached the Republican convention a distant 
second in the presidential preference polls, Bush turned again to Noonan. 
</P>
<P>
And, today, when George Bush utters what is likely to be his most-remembered 
address, the newly inaugurated President will speak the words of Peggy Noonan, 
whose speeches have marked Bush's most eloquent moments in his march to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan -- a former television news writer, later a Reagan Administration speech 
writer, an upbeat and moving lyricist -- was credited during Bush's campaign 
with drawing a heartening intensity from the often-awkward Bush, making it 
sound as though he had dredged from his soul some long-sought truth about 
himself and voiced it in his own words. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months ago in Houston, as Bush announced his presidential campaign in a 
grand hotel, he spoke through her of his yearning for a better America. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a prosperity that we can rely on; I want a prosperity that stays, that 
broadens, that deepens and that touches, finally, all Americans -- from the 
hollows of Kentucky to the sunlit streets of Denver, from the suburbs of 
Chicago to the coldest caverns of New York, from the farms of Iowa to the oil 
fields of Oklahoma and Texas." 
</P>
<P>
In the basement of Feaster's Apartments in Portsmouth, N. H., late one Thursday 
afternoon four months later, with his spirit wounded by a stunning defeat in 
Iowa, Bush spoke through her of his yearning to serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I stand, warts and all," he said. "I guess I have a tendency to avoid 
going on with great, eloquent statements of beliefs. Some are better at that 
than I am . . . . I don't always articulate, but I do feel. And I care too much 
to leave now. Our work isn't done, and I'm working my heart out here." 
</P>
<P>
And, in the cavernous Louisiana Superdome last August, his chances for the 
presidency riding on this one opportunity to define himself for America, he 
spoke through her of his yearning for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a nation of community, of thousands and tens of thousands of ethnic, 
religious, social, business, labor union, neighborhood, regional and other 
organizations, all of them varied, voluntary and unique . . . a brilliant 
diversity spread like stars, like a thousand points of light in a broad and 
peaceful sky . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I will keep America moving forward, always forward -- for a better America, 
for an endless, enduring dream and a thousand points of light." 
</P>
<P>
Politician-speech writer teams develop over a span of years -- John F. Kennedy 
and Theodore C. Sorensen, for example -- but the 64-year-old Bush and Noonan 
are relatively new partners. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan, in her late 30s, worked for CBS News for seven years before being lured 
away in 1984 by the chance to write speeches for Ronald Reagan. By then, she 
had departed from the philosophy of her Democratic family's political heroes -- 
Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- to devote herself to conservative 
teachings. 
</P>
<P>
Until she left the White House speech-writing office two years later, she wrote 
many of Reagan's most stirring speeches, from his 1984 Normandy tribute to "the 
boys of Pointe du Hoc . . . the heroes who helped end a war" to his emotional 
1986 statement on the night the Challenger exploded in the Florida skies. 
</P>
<P>
She has remained an occasional Reagan writer, contributing to his farewell 
address to the nation, which was broadcast last week. 
</P>
<P>
Aides say that Bush, despite his fondness for Noonan's speeches, does not shy 
from editing her. Earlier this week, in fact, Bush spokesman Sheila Tate said 
that a first draft of the inaugural address had been turned back to Noonan 
after the President-elect found it too long. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan was closeted with the address, and transition officials refused to 
forward calls to her. But, in 1985, in an article in the Washington Post, she 
said with a twist of humor that she began writing when she determined that 
there was nothing else she could do. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing is easy when it's inspired by love and real affection," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Her first speech for Bush was the October, 1987, announcement of his candidacy. 
Aides describe the relationship between Bush and Noonan as loose and mutually 
respectful, carried out as much via facsimile machines as in person. 
</P>
<P>
Noonan, who is married to U.S. Chamber of Commerce economist Richard Rahn, 
works largely out of her home here so that she can be near her toddler son. 
</P>
<P>
During the crisis points of the campaign, however, Noonan joined the traveling 
Bush entourage, moving with him to New Hampshire after his defeat in Iowa to 
craft a newly introspective speech and, this summer, shadowing him for days to 
gauge his thinking on the convention address. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke in July in a drenching rain on a beach in Point Pleasant, N. J., 
Noonan stood near him, blond hair slightly bedraggled and a smile on her face, 
taking his measure. 
</P>
<P>
In writing for the Los Angeles Times Opinion Section about that time, Noonan 
predicted Bush's victory but spoke bluntly about his failings. "The odd thing 
about Bush is he's been famous for 20 years and the American people don't 
really know him," she said in an article that paid tribute to, more than 
anything, Bush's wry humanness. 
</P>
<P>
Although her stock in trade is soaring prose, Noonan is not without a harsh 
rhetorical side: In New Hampshire, she crafted a harsh speech against 
then-competitor Bob Dole that, along with a massive barrage of advertising, 
helped to coalesce anti-Dole sentiment in that conservative state.

SENATE PANEL VOTES 19-0 FOR BAKER APPOINTMENT AS SECRETARY OF STATE

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously Thursday to recommend 
the confirmation of James A. Baker III as secretary of state, giving a strong 
bipartisan endorsement to President-elect Bush's first Cabinet appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's 19-0 vote was taken after two days of hearings in which Baker 
pledged to seek more consultation and consensus with Congress and both 
Democrats and Republicans gave him lavish praise. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has not formally been nominated yet, because Bush will not be sworn in as 
President until today. But Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell 
(D-R.I.) agreed to conduct the confirmation hearings early -- and acknowledged 
from the start that Baker will have no difficulty winning the Senate's approval 
once President Bush makes a formal request. 
</P>
<P>
The full Senate is expected to confirm Baker's nomination next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, 58, has known Bush for more than 20 years, worked on Bush's 1970 Senate 
campaign and managed his presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1988. He was White 
House chief of staff during President Reagan's first term and secretary of the 
Treasury during Reagan's second term.

PENTAGON MUST TRIM PLANS, DARMAN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Incoming President Bush's designated budget director bluntly warned the 
Pentagon on Thursday that it will have to slash its spending plans to meet 
Bush's budget goals. 
</P>
<P>
In his first public comments since being nominated by Bush, Richard G. Darman 
told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at his confirmation hearings 
that he believes that Congress and the White House are not prepared to give the 
Defense Department any money beyond what is needed to keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he predicted, there will "be a defense squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
Darman's comments are likely to set off alarm bells throughout the vast defense 
contracting industry, much of which is concentrated in California. Although 
Darman did not name any particular weapons programs that might be cut back, 
budget analysts have suggested that such programs as the B-2 stealth bomber 
built by Northrop Corp. in Southern California, additional aircraft carriers 
and two advanced fighters planned by the Navy and the Air Force might be 
targets for postponement or elimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Spending Planned 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, which receives about $300 billion a year, plans to spend over the 
next five years about $95 billion more than the amount that would be required 
just to keep up with inflation. Moreover, most analysts believe that the 
Pentagon could not maintain its current force structure even if it receives the 
annual 2% real budget increases it projects. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, "as a matter of realism," Darman said, those increases "won't be ever 
funded." 
</P>
<P>
Darman also said he is opposed to any relaxation of the Gramm-Rudman deficit 
targets, which require Congress and the White House to reach agreement by 
October on a budget blueprint that would cut next year's federal deficit to 
$110 billion. If they fail to agree, the law would impose automatic spending 
cuts -- split between defense and domestic programs -- that would reduce the 
projected deficit to $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although saying he vastly prefers to reach a negotiated settlement with 
Congress that would avoid the automatic cuts, Darman said the Pentagon should 
not rule out the possibility of failure and "should be prepared to take the 
(automatic cuts)." 
</P>
<P>
During an intense 4 1/2 hours of questioning by senators, Darman also sought to 
"close the door" to any impression that Bush would accept higher taxes. 
Although he acknowledged that he probably would adopt a number of 
revenue-increasing measures included in President Reagan's last budget, Darman 
told reporters during a break that "there will not be any new taxes in Bush's 
budget, as defined by any reasonable observer." 
</P>
<P>
In what may well be an early negotiating ploy designed to force Congress to go 
along with Bush's no-tax vow, Darman said that, if faced with the choice 
between automatic cuts and a tax increase, he would favor the spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said Bush expects to submit a relatively detailed budget proposal by 
mid-February that would outline his own priorities and show where he differs 
from Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman said Bush probably will rely on Reagan's economic assumptions, which 
many lawmakers have criticized as unrealistically optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Darman also suggested that the Bush Administration's plans to resolve the 
savings and loan industry crisis are likely to require about $45 billion to $50 
billion in public spending to close insolvent thrifts. He downplayed some 
estimates that the additional cost to taxpayers of a thrift bailout would 
exceed $100 billion by arguing that many of the worst thrifts already have been 
merged or sold to investors by regulators.

WHEN DRUMS BEGIN TO ROLL, A THIN GRAY LINE OF HEROES WILL STEP OUT

<P>
Since the days of Dwight D. Eisenhower, presidents have invited the nation's 
most distinguished military heroes, those who have won the Medal of Honor, to 
share in their inaugurations -- perhaps hoping that the soldiers' matchless 
luster will reflect on them. 
</P>
<P>
This year is no exception, as 146 of the 225 living Medal of Honor recipients 
gather in Washington to be honored at a variety of inaugural dinners, 
receptions and balls. 
</P>
<P>
Most have long since left military service. Except for biennial convocations, 
they store their star-shaped medals and sky-blue ribbons in engraved boxes and 
seldom talk about their deeds of gallantry. But this week the holders of the 
nation's highest military honor proudly wear their decorations and allow the 
country to salute them. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like financier Jack Jacobs of Sherman Oaks, devote their energies to 
their new careers and recall their glorious and terrifying wartime action only 
when thrown together with the select society of Medal of Honor holders. 
</P>
<P>
At a reception Wednesday night sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
Jacobs, executive vice president of AutoFinance Group Inc., wanted only to talk 
about his business -- buying and selling consumer auto loans. 
</P>
<P>
For Jacobs, the events of March 9, 1968, in Vietnam are part of the dim and 
distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Jacobs, 
with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate 
a seriously wounded adviser to the safety of a wooded area where he 
administered life-saving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic 
weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. 
</P>
<P>
 On three separate occasions, Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads 
who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing 
three and wounding several others. His gallant actions and extraordinary 
heroism saved the lives of one U.S. adviser and 13 allied soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Other Medal of Honor recipients seemingly cannot let go of their wartime 
experiences. Retired Army Sgt. Roy P. Benavidez of El Campo, Tex., might be 
considered a professional military hero. His business card carries a replica of 
the Medal of Honor, an American flag and the words "Airborne All the Way" and 
"Be All You can Be." 
</P>
<P>
Benavidez, who in 1981 received the most-recent Medal of Honor for valor in 
Vietnam, complained that recent movies have been unfair to the Vietnam veteran 
and the Latino veteran in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood has really ambushed the Vietnam vet," Benavidez said. 
</P>
<P>
On his second trip with the wounded, he was clubbed from behind by an enemy 
soldier. In the ensuing hand-to-hand combat, he sustained additional wounds to 
his head and arms before killing his adversary. He then continued under 
devastating fire to carry the wounded to the helicopter. Upon reaching the 
aircraft, he spotted and killed two enemy soldiers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Only then, in extremely serious condition from numerous wounds and loss of 
blood, did he allow himself to be pulled into the extraction aircraft. Sgt. 
Benavidez' gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical 
straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal 
to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight 
men. 
</P>
<P>
The Medal of Honor, often incorrectly referred to as the Congressional Medal of 
Honor because it was authorized by Congress, is the nation's highest award to 
its servicemen. Standards for its issue are stricter than for any other 
decoration, requiring wartime action "so outstanding that it clearly 
distinguishes his gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of 
bravery." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Vatican's standards for beatification, it requires "incontestable" 
testimony from two living eyewitnesses. The recipient must have risked his life 
and must have acted when inaction would have subjected him to no justifiable 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 3,410 Americans have been granted the distinction, but more than half 
of those were honored for service in the Civil War and the Indian campaigns, 
when standards were less stringent. 
</P>
<P>
The Medal of Honor was awarded 127 times in World War I, 469 times in World War 
II, 131 times in Korea and 238 times for service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
In this century, more than half of the decorations have been awarded 
posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff DeBlanc, of St. Martinsville, La., has attended every inauguration since 
1961 with his Medal of Honor peers. Today he is a physicist with South Central 
Bell Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The inaugural is a privilege they extend" to ribbon holders, said DeBlanc, a 
former Marine Corps fighter pilot who served in the South Pacific in World War 
II. "It's a tradition they handed down from other administrations." 
</P>
<P>
DeBlanc said he prefers not to talk about his war record or his decoration. "I 
never discuss it. That's past history," he said. "My own children don't know 
much about it. That ended in 1945." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his escort mission was fulfilled upon the safe retirement of the 
bombers, 1st Lt. DeBlanc courageously remained on the scene despite a rapidly 
diminishing fuel supply and, boldly challenging the enemy's superior number of 
float planes, fought a valiant battle against terrific odds, seizing the 
tactical advantage and striking repeatedly to destroy three of the hostile 
aircraft and to disperse the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared to maneuver his damaged plane back to base, he had climbed aloft and 
set his course when he discovered two Zeros closing in behind. Undaunted, he 
opened fire and blasted both Zeros from the sky in a short, bitterly fought 
action which resulted in such hopeless damage to his own plane that he was 
forced to bail out at a perilously low altitude atop the trees on enemy-held 
Kolombangara. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving the Medal of Honor entitles one to free transport on military 
aircraft, to an additional $200 a month in pension benefits and to free 
transportation and lodging for such events as the inaugural. 
</P>
<P>
The group has its own society, which has offices aboard the retired aircraft 
carrier Intrepid, which is tied up in New York Harbor along the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
"You take every advantage you can of getting together with the other 
recipients," said Sgt. Maj. Jon Cavaiani, one of only two dozen holders of the 
Medal of Honor still on active duty in the armed forces. "When I got it in 
1974, there were 465 recipients alive. Now there are only 225." 
</P>
<P>
 The enemy forces advanced in two ranks, first firing a heavy volume of small 
arms automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenade fire while the second rank 
continuously threw a steady barrage of hand grenades at the beleaguered force. 
Sgt. Cavaiani returned a heavy barrage of small arms and hand grenade fire on 
the assaulting enemy force but was unable to slow them down. He ordered the 
remaining platoon members to attempt to escape while he provided them with 
cover fire. 
</P>
<P>
 With one last courageous exertion, Sgt. Cavaiani recovered a machine gun, 
stood up, completely exposing himself to the heavy enemy fire directed at him 
and began firing the machine gun in a sweeping motion along the two ranks of 
advancing enemy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 While inflicting severe losses on the advancing enemy force, Sgt. Cavaiani was 
wounded numerous times. Sgt. Cavaiani's conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary 
heroism and intrepidity at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of 
duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and 
reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Army.

M. SHIMKIN; EARLY CANCER RESEARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Shimkin, a Siberian-born researcher who began studying the link between 
smoking and lung cancer more than 50 years ago, has died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
Shimkin, a professor emeritus at UC San Diego, died of a stroke Monday at the 
medical center there, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shimkin was one of the first researchers to explore the causes of cancer, 
beginning his work in the 1930s. Among his achievements were studies in the 
1950s that were among the first to connect smoking and lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to emphasize the importance of major factors such as smoking, 
drinking and diet over concerns about trace chemicals linked to cancer," said 
Dr. Cedric Garland, an epidemiologist at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Shimkin was born in Siberia in 1912 but emigrated to the United States and 
eventually settled in San Francisco with his family. Educated at UC Berkeley 
and UC San Francisco in the 1930s, Shimkin devoted his career to cancer 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"He covered a great deal of territory in his career, including clinical, 
experimental and epidemiological investigations," said Dr. Joseph Fraumeni, 
director of the epidemiology and biostatistics program at the National Cancer 
Institute, where Shimkin worked until 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Shimkin's books, "Science and Cancer" and "Contrary to Nature," are considered 
classics in the cancer research field, UCSD officials said.

SCIENTISTS GET OK FOR GENE-TRANSFER TRIALS ON HUMANS

<P>
The government gave scientists permission Thursday to transfer foreign genes 
into humans for the first time, approving a test in which bacteria genes will 
be used to track the effectiveness of a new cancer therapy. 
</P>
<P>
After seven months of review, Dr. James Wyngaarden, director of the National 
Institutes of Health, gave a team of government researchers the go-ahead to 
begin the gene-transfer trials. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration approved the plan earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of biotechnology have argued against inserting foreign genes into 
humans, citing concern that such experiments might go awry and saying 
researchers should not "play God" with human genetics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to those people who raise objections that last year 485,000 
Americans died of cancer -- one every minute," said project director Dr. Steven 
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute. "We are trying to develop new 
treatments to help them and this is important to that effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone through an exhaustive inquiry into the safety of this trial . . . 
and we have found there is virtually no danger to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
In October, an institutes advisory panel approved the plan to put new genes in 
the cells of 10 terminally ill cancer patients. But Wyngaarden sent the project 
back to the committee after learning that the researchers withheld printed data 
due to fears that making it public might hurt their chances of publishing 
articles in scientific journals. 
</P>
<P>
In the new experiment, scientists from the cancer institute and the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute plan to collect cancer-fighting cells, called 
tumor-fighting lymphocytes, or TILs, from 10 patients with an advanced stage of 
a deadly type of skin cancer called melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results Unpredictable 
</P>
<P>
The researchers will then "insert marker genes from bacteria into the cells and 
return the genetically altered cells to the patients from which they were 
taken," said institutes spokesman Frank Mahaney. 
</P>
<P>
The tool used to insert the bacteria gene is a mouse leukemia virus that has 
been "disarmed" so that it cannot cause disease, Mahaney said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers hope the genetically altered TIL cells will allow them to 
determine why a promising new form of cancer treatment that uses such cells 
helps some cancer patients but not others. 
</P>
<P>
In TIL therapy, scientists remove tumors from cancer patients and use a human 
growth factor, called interleukin-2, to produce large amounts -- up to 10 
trillion -- of the cancer-fighting TIL cells. The cells are then put back into 
the cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers think it should be easy to trace the activity of the genetically 
altered TIL cells because they are designed to be resistant to an antibiotic 
that kills normal cells. Blood or tissue samples will be used for those 
tracking tests. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said he hopes the test will pave the way for therapy in which TIL 
cells can be genetically altered to produce substances that will improve their 
efficiency in killing cancer cells.

BAN SOUGHT ON INSURERS' CONTRIBUTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BILL WANTS TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENCE OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>

Moving to prevent insurers from dominating their government regulator, a state 
senator introduced legislation Thursday that would prohibit the industry from 
contributing campaign funds to candidates for the new elective office of 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) told a press conference he feared that, 
without the ban, insurance companies would use campaign contributions to 
control an office that had been created by Proposition 103 to protect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we have, I think, some very strict rules and regulations as it applies 
to contributions to this particular office, we run the risk that it . . . could 
in fact become basically an agent of the very industry it was established to 
regulate," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, including a 20% premium rate rollback, Proposition 103 
calls for the election of a state insurance commissioner beginning in 1990. 
Currently, the insurance commissioner is appointed by the governor. However, 
the provisions of Proposition 103 are on hold, awaiting a review of its 
constitutionality by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Barrow of California Common Cause, a nonprofit group supporting campaign 
financing reform, said the insurance industry already has demonstrated its 
ability to invest huge sums in political issues and races by pouring at least 
$65 million into last fall's insurance initiative campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions Unfair 
</P>
<P>
However, David Fountain, public information director for the Assn. of 
California Insurance Cos., insisted the industry has not abused its right to 
make campaign donations and that it would be unfair to force restrictions on 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Why not take similar action, he asked, against lawyers who contribute to 
judicial races or bankers and bond houses that pour campaign money into races 
for state treasurer and controller? "Right now it's popular to jump on the 
bandwagon of whipping the insurance industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain questioned the constitutionality of Hart's bill because its 
prohibitions would apply to contributions from insurance agents and brokers as 
well as insurance companies and political action committees. "I don't think you 
can stop individuals from participating in the election process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barrow said similar bans had been successfully enacted in North Carolina, 
Delaware and Washington. In all, 11 states have elected insurance 
commissioners. In states without contribution restrictions, he said, industry 
donations tend to "overwhelm" the election process. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hart and Fountain predicted the bill had a "good chance" of passing, 
particularly in the political climate created by the defeat of insurance 
industry-backed initiatives in November. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the ban on contributions, Hart's bill would prohibit the elected 
commissioner from accepting speaking fees and from taking a job in the 
insurance industry for two years after leaving office. The bill also would 
require candidates for insurance commissioner to disclose all income sources 
for the two years before filing for office.

CHILD-CARE CENTERS SET FOR JOB-SEEKING MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federally funded after-school child-care centers, designed to free up welfare 
mothers so they can find jobs or enter training programs, will open later this 
year at four Los Angeles housing projects, Mayor Tom Bradley announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The centers, which will serve 245 school-age children, will be set up in 
community rooms on city Housing Authority property with a 1-year, $329,190 
grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"The women of the projects will benefit . . . greatly," Leila Gonzalez-Correa, 
Housing Authority executive director, said at a news conference at the Ramona 
Gardens housing project. "I believe the residents want to lift themselves out 
of that cycle of poverty." 
</P>
<P>
One center at Nickerson Gardens in Watts, the city's largest housing project, 
will serve about 150 school-age children. About 30 to 35 children will be 
served at each of the other centers -- at Ramona Gardens in East Los Angeles, 
Pueblo del Rio in South Los Angeles and Normont Gardens in Wilmington, Bradley 
aide Wendy Greuel said. 
</P>
<P>
The money for the program is part of $3 million distributed this year by HUD to 
housing projects nationwide for child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The centers are slated to open in March, but some may not be ready until June. 
</P>
<P>
The free or low-cost child care will enable welfare parents to get jobs or take 
job-training classes, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
A new state law requires single mothers or fathers on welfare who have 
school-age children to go to work, enter job-training programs or risk losing 
their welfare payments.

USE OF STEEL PIPES SUGGESTED FOR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A marine engineering consultant has recommended that plastic-coated steel pipes 
be used instead of wood pilings to reconstruct the Redondo Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The steel pilings under a concrete deck would provide greater resistance 
against the kind of storms and fires that destroyed most of the pier last year, 
the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Crumpley, project engineer for Long Beach-based firm Moffatt &amp; Nichol, 
told the Redondo Beach City Council that construction and maintenance costs for 
a pier using the steel pipes would also be lower than costs for four other 
options studied by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said a Japanese company, Nippon Steel, has developed a plastic pipe coating 
that effectively resists salt-water corrosion for up to 70 years. In the 
recommended design, the pilings would connect through steel caps to a concrete 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
Up to half of the $6-million pier reconstruction project will be financed by 
the state under the Natural Disaster Assistance Act, City Manager Tim Casey 
told the council.

RUSH IS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT OF NEW CAL STATE SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Rush, who has been dean of San Diego State University's North County 
Center in San Marcos, has been named vice president of the new Cal State San 
Marcos and will take responsibility for the new campus until a president is 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
Rush's appointment was announced by W. Ann Reynolds, chancellor of the 
California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
"His expertise will be invaluable in coordinating the transition to a 
full-service campus," Reynolds said. "There are literally thousands of details 
involved in creating a new campus, and it is imperative that an able 
administrator be on the scene to oversee those details. Dr. Rush's familiarity 
with the site and with the operations of the North County Center will be a 
great asset." 
</P>
<P>
A new president for Cal State San Marcos is expected to be named this summer, 
and will assume responsibility for the campus by September. The university is 
expected to open to upper-division students in the fall of 1992, and to 
freshmen and sophomores in 1995.

REVISED GROWTH-MANAGEMENT PLAN DESIGNED TO BYPASS CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to avoid "analysis paralysis" as the San Diego City Council prepares to 
tackle anew the politically thorny issue of growth-management, two council 
members and Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Thursday offered a plan to quickly adopt 
some of the key provisions of a growth-control ballot measure defeated by 
voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, developed by Council members Bob Filner and Judy McCarty and 
endorsed by O'Connor, encompasses some of the major components of last fall's 
Proposition H, a City Council-backed growth-control plan rejected by a 
55.5%-44.5% margin. Although sharing goals with Proposition H, the plan differs 
significantly from the ballot measure in that it eschews annual housing caps as 
a method of controlling growth. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the proposal -- dubbed "A City That Works" by its authors -- seeks 
to provide a conceptual guideline on growth policies intended to balance 
environmental protection against the need for sufficient development to 
"preserve a climate conducive to economic growth," the council members said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortcut Through Process 
</P>
<P>
San Diego voters' rejection of both Proposition H and a more stringent citizen 
growth-control initiative on last November's ballot set the stage for a renewal 
of last year's protracted debate on the subject. McCarty and Filner described 
their plan as a shortcut through round two of that potentially lengthy, costly 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way to accomplish most of our goals without having to spend millions 
of dollars and taking months to do it," Filner said at a news conference in his 
City Hall office. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty added: "We don't need more consultants, we don't need more studies and 
charts and endless hearings. This is a way to do these things now." 
</P>
<P>
Filner also argued that it was significant that he and McCarty -- "two people 
perceived to be at opposite ends of this debate" -- crafted the three-page memo 
sent to other council members Thursday. While Filner is regarded as one of the 
strongest environmentalists on the council, McCarty has compiled a strong 
pro-development record during her first three years at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that, if we could agree, the council ought to come to an 
agreement," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
The two council members expressed hope that their colleagues could adopt their 
proposal as early as next week, when the council is scheduled to consider 
various growth-control proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Although McCarty said the proposal contains "nothing new," Filner stressed that 
its value lies in its brevity, which stems from their conscious effort to 
address the complicated growth issue "in a concise way . . . that people can 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
"It tries to come up with a reasonable, sensible protection of sensitive lands 
while recognizing that there has to be some flexibility," the councilman said. 
"This is a pragmatic attempt to balance competing concerns. . . . Nobody's evil 
because they're . . . trying to protect the environment or no one's evil 
because they're trying to develop property." 
</P>
<P>
The Filner-McCarty plan sets broad goals in four basic areas: neighborhood 
preservation, the funding and timing of public facilities, protection of 
sensitive lands and overall environmental goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conform Zoning 
</P>
<P>
With an eye on preserving single-family neighborhoods, the council members 
recommend that the Planning Department schedule hearings to make zoning conform 
with all community plans by August. Under the plan, city planners would also 
identify proposed "single-family preservation areas" in communities throughout 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
One of the focal points in recent growth debates has involved the provision of 
public facilities such as streets, parks and libraries necessitated by new 
developments. McCarty and Filner suggest that the city take steps to accelerate 
so-called "turnkey development" policies, ensuring that developers build needed 
roads, parks and other public facilities before buyers move into new homes. 
</P>
<P>
By linking growth and public facilities "very directly, very pragmatically, 
very clearly," Filner said, the city will be able to accomplish many of the 
same goals that last November's propositions sought to attain through 
controversial annual caps on housing construction. (As a corollary, the 
Planning Department is reviewing an O'Connor proposal that would establish 
stand-by housing limits that could be implemented in the event of runaway 
growth in a particular area.) 
</P>
<P>
In accord with Proposition H's goals, the plan unveiled Thursday also would 
protect environmentally sensitive lands, with individuals or communities having 
options to propose revisions to which areas would be preserved in a natural 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The Filner-McCarty plan also would establish broad environmental goals, 
including adoption by July of a traffic-reduction plan incorporating the 
provisions of last November's Proposition K, an advisory measure calling for 
companies that employ at least 25 workers to offer staggered work hours in an 
effort to reduce peak-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Their other recommendations include establishing a curb-side recycling program 
within three years, preparing an open-space bond measure for voter 
consideration in 1990 and developing a water reclamation program.

PUBLIC POWER GROUP URGES PANEL TO REJECT SDG&amp;E-EDISON MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s proposed merger with Southern California 
Edison would have a "substantial and adverse impact" on utility competition in 
the Western United States, according to the American Public Power Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based group Thursday asked federal regulators to reject the 
proposed merger "as it is now structured" or give municipal utilities increased 
access to the massive web of electric transmission lines that a combined Edison 
and SDG&amp;E would own, power association attorney Alan H. Richardson said. 
The association represents many of the nation's 2,000 publicly owned utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) to take into account 
the needs of all utilities in the Southwestern region," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grown in Importance 
</P>
<P>
Transmission access has grown in importance to municipal utilities and would be 
of tremendous importance should a government agency in San Diego acquire 
SDG&amp;E's existing system in order to stymie Edison's proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Municipalities "quite often are like islands in the middle of an investor-owned 
utility," Richardson said. Too often, municipal utilities that can buy power 
elsewhere are stymied because investor-owned utilities won't carry that power 
on their lines, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
The power association has asked federal regulators to institute transmission 
guidelines similar to those included in the recent merger between Pacificorp, a 
Portland-based utility holding company, and Utah Power &amp; Light, a Salt Lake 
City-based utility. Federal regulators have demanded that the resulting utility 
make transmission space available to municipal utilities and other electric 
power companies. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that order was signed, Edison began "a barrage of objections," 
Richardson said. "Edison has orchestrated objections from a number of other 
investor-owned utilities who are seeking to modify the (Pacificorp) order or 
find ways to ensure that a precedent was not established." 
</P>
<P>
Edison, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rosemead-based SCEcorp, "did oppose that 
order, along with a number of other utilities," Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps 
said Thursday. "We thought it would be detrimental to the interests of our 
(electric) customers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Set Precedent 
</P>
<P>
The power association, which was joined by the National Rural Electric 
Cooperative in the Thursday filing, maintained that the Pacificorp order should 
set a precedent because "nationally, there are other (investor-owned) utilities 
that also will be seeking to merge . . . and the same questions will arise," 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, "individual utilities have built their own transmission lines 
with little thought for other utilities in the region," Richardson said. "But 
we've got to think in broader terms . . . and transmission is the key." 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot increase competition in this industry by adding more producers of 
power," Richardson said. "You have to have transmission access." 
</P>
<P>
The energy commission is one of half a dozen federal and state regulatory 
agencies that must approve Edison's merger with SDG&amp;E. Edison shareholders 
will vote on the merger at the company's regularly scheduled annual meeting 
April 20. SDG&amp;E shareholders will vote on the merger at a meeting April 18.

ALTRUISM, BUSINESS JOINED AT FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man on the phone sounded desperate. He had been working at a factory for 13 
years but had not been promoted -- because he is Latino, he suspected. What 
should he do? 
</P>
<P>
Moments before, an exasperated woman called seeking help in collecting $1,000 
that her former landlord had borrowed more than a year ago. Neither caller 
spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
The director of Centro de Proteccion Familiar (Center for Family Protection) 
set up appointments to help solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Director Ana Rosa Rodriguez told the man that the center's staff could write 
letters to his supervisor and to the company president explaining the 
situation. She would also refer him to the state Department of Fair Employment 
and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez assigned one of her mediators to work with the other caller and the 
former landlord. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged No Fee 
</P>
<P>
There was no charge to either client. 
</P>
<P>
The same services could be provided by a number of publicly funded, nonprofit 
social service agencies, but Centro de Proteccion Familiar has a distinguishing 
characteristic: It is a business run by executives who mix altruism with 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
The center is the brainchild of Spanish Research &amp; Marketing, a South 
Pasadena-based advertising and marketing firm that specializes in the Latino 
market. It sees itself as a way to help first- and second-generation Latinos 
adjust to life here, while generating business for doctors and other 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
It tries to build good will in the Latino community by providing free services 
such as translation of rental agreements and other legal documents, mediation 
services for tenants and consumers and information on immigration questions, 
among other things. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, counselors come across people who need medical, legal and 
insurance services. Dennis Delmonte, one of three principals of Spanish 
Research &amp; Marketing, says the center has generated hundreds of referrals 
for doctors and other health professionals, who pay from $3,000 to $5,000 a 
month to be part of the cooperative marketing campaign. More than 60 
professional health offices and an insurance company participate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving Something Back 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we've done very well," Delmonte said. "We had a sense we owed 
something and wanted to give something back. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The center's first office was opened in the Pico-Union district of Los Angeles 
in 1986. A second office was established in Montebello last July, and a third 
was opened in Santa Ana last month. Rodriguez said a fourth office will be 
opened in San Bernardino within two months. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Research &amp; Marketing was established in 1978 by Jorge Azpiazu, who 
was born in Argentina, and Tito Alvarez, a native of Puerto Rico. Delmonte, who 
said his parents are from Puerto Rico and Chile, became a partner later. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative marketing campaign for lawyers they opened in 1978 became 
Centro de Proteccion Legal, a subsidiary. Delmonte said lawyers from about 350 
offices in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego 
counties pay from $1,500 to $9,600 a month to participate in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly fee buys them a marketing program, which includes group advertising 
in Spanish-language media, instruction in how to treat Latino clients and other 
assistance.

DEFENDANT IN PORT FRAUD MISSES ARRAIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arrest warrant was issued Thursday for a San Ysidro man who failed to show 
up for his arraignment in a much-publicized fraud case involving the San Diego 
Unified Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo Olivarria-Castillo, 54, is in Mexico, and his attorney, Jan Ronis, said 
in court that he has not heard from him since the grand-theft charges were 
filed Jan. 12. Last week, Ronis said Castillo was on vacation in Mexico, but 
Thursday afternoon he said he still had not heard from him. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick issued the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was a sales representative for the Genuine Auto Parts/Napa store 
downtown, which allegedly provided phony invoices to the Port District. The 
invoices sought payment for merchandise never delivered to the district. 
Instead, prosecutors claim, the invoices were used to mask the purchase of 
private items for Port employees and their friends, items such as car repairs 
and stereos. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged are two former Port workers -- Rudi Enriques, 37, and Richard 
Cersosimo, 48 -- and Paul Manes, 49. Manes worked for the auto parts store. 
</P>
<P>
The other three men will be arraigned Feb. 2.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: RUSTY PELICAN'S ECLECTIC COOKERY COMES TO ROOST IN 
MISSION VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of these fine days, food historians will classify a peculiarly American 
branch of world gastronomy as "suburban cooking." 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has been with us at least since the 1950s, when women's 
magazines introduced bizarre dishes, compounded of packaged ingredients, that 
the magazines assured their readers were "smart" and modern. 
</P>
<P>
Convenience is a hallmark of this style of cooking, but "gourmet" qualities, no 
matter how unlikely, always are implied. Take, for example, the "skillet 
lasagna" introduced by a manufacturer in the early 1970s. It bears not the 
slightest resemblance to real lasagna, but its soupy consistency and 
foreign-sounding name make it an exemplar of suburban cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant chains came along well after suburban cooking developed. Several 
chains have adopted some of its features, especially an insistence on creating 
dishes that sound foreign while being familiarly and comfortably American in 
most other respects. One of the nicer things that can be said about 
restaurant-style suburban cooking is that it has remained largely in the 
suburbs, leaving city dwellers untroubled by its homespun pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
But incursions are being made. In San Diego, the natural spot for an invasion 
is Mission Valley, which, because of its freeways and low-slung shopping 
centers, is in many ways a suburban island in the city. It is here that the 
Rusty Pelican chain has chosen to open a branch. 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine a la Rusty Pelican, in many ways the epitome of restaurant-style 
suburban cooking, must strike a responsive chord, because the place seems 
remarkably busy. Visits were made on Monday and Tuesday evenings, which are 
graveyard nights for most eateries, and on both occasions the dining rooms were 
still full at 9 p.m., an hour at which most restaurateurs start to think about 
locking up. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Rusty Pelican seem so suburban in its style -- other than the 
decor, which includes a rusty-looking pelican sculpture near the entrance -- is 
the way it plays fast and loose with elements of foreign cooking to produce 
what are essentially American results. (Sometimes the results are ersatz, and 
hard to classify in any cuisine.) 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say that the cooking lacks savor, because some dishes are rather 
good. But there is an air of amateurism about others that suggests cheerful 
experimentation in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
You need look no further than the first entry on the menu to find a prime 
example of this jumbling of various cuisines to produce an original, if 
slightly skewed, dish. Called ichiban, its menu description reads "bites of 
fresh seafood and shrimp marinated in sake, soy sauce and thyme. Skewered, 
broiled and served with chili ancho (sic) mayonnaise." 
</P>
<P>
The name and marinade (except for the thyme) are Japanese; the mayonnaise, 
nicely heated with crushed ancho chilies, is nouvelle Southwestern, and the 
technique is both international and American barbecue. The result of this wild 
mix of styles actually tastes pretty good (especially because of the sauce), 
which just goes to show that suburban cooking does have its moments. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list goes directly to the sources with Japanese sashimi and 
all-American shrimp cocktail and raw clams and oysters. An entry that specifies 
mussels steamed in a "spiced Pernod cream and wine broth" sounds like 
suburban-style French. 
</P>
<P>
The menu concentrates heavily on seafood (a montage of iced fish, frozen in 
active poses in a glass case, dominates the foyer), but offers chicken and 
steak as well, and generally takes a "something for everyone" approach that 
includes many of the types of cooking currently in favor among Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, pasta, in the form of fettuccine topped with clams or 
salmon and a "creamy Alfredo sauce." It cannot be said too many times that 
there is no such thing, since Alfredo is a method of combining ingredients, not 
a prepared sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant tosses an excellent Caesar salad at the table, a good choice for 
diners who order their entrees a la carte. Full dinners include the choice of 
overly thickened clam chowder; simple green or spinach salads, and such side 
dishes as baked or deep-fried potatoes, sliced tomatoes and mixed vegetables. 
(These last, lightly and happily steamed to the al dente stage, are sprinkled 
with a strong grated cheese that not only does them no good, but also is at 
odds with many of the entrees.) 
</P>
<P>
Among standing entrees are a tarragon-lemon-mustard-flavored grilled chicken 
breast that, in its list of flavorings, is convincingly French; however, the 
chicken was somewhat underdone and the flavorings had been used too sparingly 
to make any impact. A dish called "firepot shrimp" seems to hint at the Chinese 
in its name, although the menu simply describes it as "succulent sauteed shrimp 
smothered in a piquant sauce." The shrimp were overcooked and dry, and the 
sauce seemed largely composed of Szechuan chili oil, which is hot, if not 
particularly flavorful, on its own -- it is meant as a seasoning, not as a 
principal ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
The daily fish list is lengthy and impressive, and offers a profusion of 
unsauced char-broiled and sauteed specimens, including Lake Superior whitefish, 
local shark and halibut, Louisiana catfish and king salmon from Oregon. The 
list also offers plenty of gussied-up dishes that return us to the fishy realm 
of suburban cuisine, such as the mahi mahi Mokihana, "marinated in a homemade 
African-style barbecue sauce." 
</P>
<P>
The char-broiled Hawaiian ahi in "Chinese pesto sauce" seemed more Japanese 
than anything else because of the strips of pickled ginger that topped the 
fish; pesto is Italian, and when anything Italian suddenly is classified as 
Chinese, we know we're in the land of unrestrained improvisation. Ahi is a 
beef-like fish that can stand up to strong garnishes and sauces, and this was a 
healthy slab, although the treatment was not impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is true to itself to the last, and concludes with desserts that run 
from a very respectable homemade cheesecake to a wildly odd pecan pie topped 
with chocolate mousse, a combination that seems unlikely in theory and is awful 
in practice. But the cheesecake is quite good, the filling creamy and spiked 
with a strong hint of cinnamon.

50% PAY RAISE FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are told that a 50% pay raise for senior government officials, members of 
Congress, and federal judges is necessary to attract and keep the best leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that a raise will assure us of more leaders of Dan Quayle's and 
Ronald Reagan's intellectual caliber?

50% PAY RAISE FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is ludicrous for Congress to ask for a 50% raise. This is the Congress which 
has refused for eight years to raise the minimum wage from $3.35. This is the 
Congress, which in the name of tackling the deficit, has cut the pay of 
Medicare workers and has cut back in other areas. This is the Congress which 
must make hard decisions in the future about the financial future of many. 
</P>
<P>
They look stupid to the average American family making $29,000 a year for 
tacking on such a huge pay increase for themselves, and it is insidious that 
they should do it in such a way. If there is a problem with some members taking 
unwarranted speaking fees, they should simply prohibit those speaking 
engagements.

FALL-OFF IN BUSINESS GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study by the Conference Board reveals a leveling off of corporate 
charitable giving even as profits have been on the increase. The figures 
reflect continued emphasis on education and a continued decline in support for 
health and human services -- a trend that has compounded the problems of 
social-service agencies that have been the targets of significant government 
cuts during the Reagan Administration. Yet the prospects are not as gloomy as 
the figures suggest. 
</P>
<P>
The study covers the year 1987. Preliminary indications suggest that 1988 
figures will reflect an increase, with a major rebound likely this year. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 328 leading corporations showed an increase in contributions of 
less than 5% in 1987, compared with annual increases of more than 10% in the 
previous decade. When the giving of all companies -- large and small -- is 
counted, the total for 1987 is the same as for 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The 328 leading companies gave educational institutions 37% of their 
contributions, health and human services 27%, civic and community activities 
14%, the arts 11%, and a variety of other interests 11%. Education has 
maintained a relatively stable share of the total giving, but the percentage 
for health and human services has been declining for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey also finds that during 1987 increases in corporate profits 
significantly outpaced rises in contribution budgets," the board reported. "One 
example: While the manufacturing companies reported an aggregate increase of 
20% in corporate profits in 1987, their contribution budgets rose by 4%. The 
result, of course, was a dip in the ratio of contributions to pretax income." 
</P>
<P>
The pattern of giving has been made somewhat unpredictable by reorganizations, 
mergers and leveraged buyouts. In 1986, for example, RJR-Nabisco gave its 
corporate headquarters office building in North Carolina to Wake Forest 
University, a gift valued at $40 million. And in 1987, after General Electric 
swallowed RCA, it gave the Sarnoff Laboratories in New Jersey to SRI 
International, a donation valued at $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Research by the Council for Financial Aid to Education suggests a "pronounced 
upturn in 1989 of 5% to 10%," we were told by Hayden W. Smith, senior vice 
president. Indeed, his analysis suggests that the plateau in giving has just 
been a delayed reaction to the decline in corporate profits that began in 1980. 
Profits did not regain the level at which they had peaked in 1979 until 1987. 
Despite falling profits, there had been an unprecedented increase in corporate 
giving, doubling from 1979 to 1986. That represented an increase in giving from 
less than 1% of pretax profits in 1979 to 1.99% of pretax profits in 1985. 
Profits are now setting new records, up 30% in the last two years, inspiring 
projections of significant increases in corporate giving this year.

50% PAY RAISE FOR FEDERAL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incredibly, The Times has endorsed the 50% pay increase for Congress, federal 
judges, and top executive officials (editorial, "Washington Pay Day," Jan. 8). 
In its endorsement, The Times calls the increase "sensible and long overdue." 
Hogwash! Strangely, the endorsement is silent on the matter of perquisites 
(pensions, tax exemptions, allowances, medical benefits, and various other 
privileges and amenities). 
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader and former Sen. William Proxmire maintain that 
when the monetary value of these perquisites is added to the current salaries 
these positions are adequately compensated. The Times editors should read the 
article of Dec. 19 (Part I) which outlines these perks in detail. Let's have a 
reconsideration of the endorsement.

STEADY AS SHE GOES, ON COURSE TO DISASTER?; 
</P>
<P>
LACKING A COMPASS, BUSH TEAM MAY TOO EASILY ACCEPT A TILT TO LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BETHELL, Tom Bethell is the Washington editor of the American Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Establishment is back," a Washington Post editor wrote a few days ago, 
"not just the individuals and the pedigrees but the state of mind." David 
Ignatius, the editor of Outlook, noted that Secretary of State-designate James 
A. Baker III was busily consulting with his predecessors in a way that was 
reminiscent of "the best and the brightest" at the outset of John F. Kennedy's 
Administration. Andover, Yale and Princeton are back in the saddle. The new 
buzzwords in President Bush's Washington are said to be bipartisan foreign 
policy and partnership with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
How long is this chumminess likely to last? Lurking beneath the comparison with 
the best and the brightest is the implicit prediction of disaster ahead. 
Kennedy's Ivy Leaguers soon strolled into the quagmire of Vietnam. Does a 
similar fate await Bush's team, so many of whom come from a comparable 
background? 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives fear that this might be the case. Bush clearly regards 
conservatives as one among many interest groups to be placated, not as the 
source of a philosophy that is perilous to ignore. By all accounts, policy in 
the Bush Administration is to be determined by a pragmatic weighing of 
conflicting advice. This sounds fine, but in practice it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a philosophy of government it is difficult to assess the 
merits of advice given by conflicting experts. President Jimmy Carter stayed up 
till midnight in the Oval Office agonizing over rival reports on energy policy. 
To deregulate or not to deregulate? Meanwhile, we waited in gasoline lines. 
Armed with a philosophy, President Ronald Reagan decided right away, and by 
mid-afternoon could usually head off to the family quarters upstairs. This is 
not to say that a free-market philosophy (Reagan's, in the case of energy 
policy) is always right, but some philosophy is needed when decisions have to 
be made every day, and often quickly. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear at present that Bush has such a philosophy. The public service 
that his patrician father urged on him merely restates the problem of 
government. It does not solve it. Washington is currently celebrating the 
belief that the new skipper has arrived at the White House without a compass. 
This is a pleasant prospect for Beltway hands, who have a compass of their own 
and will be only too happy to let Bush use it. It comes with a built-in 
Democratic "tilt," and suggests a course to the left of center. 
</P>
<P>
It is considered tactless to point out that the present consensus in Washington 
was achieved by the Reagan Administration's latter-day adoption of Democratic 
policies. Somehow in the last two years Reagan mislaid his compass and borrowed 
the Beltway's model. Bush has strongly signaled that he intends to continue 
using it. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives believe that this course -- steady as she goes -- will end in one 
disaster or another. And they note the irony: Reagan's capitulations came late 
enough in the day that their effects would not be experienced on his watch, but 
on that of his successor. 
</P>
<P>
The principal architects of Reagan's emerging pragmatism, it is widely believed 
in Washington, were Secretary of State George P. Shultz and James Baker. Now, 
as the incoming secretary of state, Baker will justly inherit the whirlwind. 
Here are a few of the storm warnings. 
</P>
<P>
A new agreement in Southern Africa, signed after the November election, could 
easily lead to the Marxist takeover of Namibia and its permanent enthronement 
in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua the Contras have been abandoned in all but name. Cubans and 
Soviets will now have a freer hand to continue their surreptitious military 
advance in that country, from which tens of thousands of Nicaraguans are 
fleeing to the United States. Bush has suggested that he will "take a look at" 
our refugee policy, and has hinted at the worst solution: more federal aid for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador's economy has been reduced to shambles by U.S. economic aid, and 
its government is propped up by U.S. military aid. Nothing has been done to 
address the Latin American debt problem, the "Baker plan" having failed. Only a 
move toward free markets will help Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Peru. Yet 
bailing out U.S. banks as a prelude to further loans, which appears to be 
Baker's strategy, is the one course of action guaranteed to postpone the shift 
to free markets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all these countries are threatened by leftward-moving governments. 
But the real danger lies in the Soviet Union, precisely because their economy 
appears to be collapsing. No longer can the Soviets believe that they will 
overtake us by peaceful means. Militarily they are still strong, but this 
cannot long outlast economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
Prudently, we should calculate that their military commanders may soon start 
thinking what is for us the unthinkable: Use it or lose it. And so we should be 
thinking of defense -- strategic defense. But the Establishment, the one that 
is now "back" and running things in Washington, does not want to defend 
America. And it does not want to because it is afraid to. "This tremendous 
opposition to introducing a defensive element to the U.S. deterrent strategy," 
Air Force Chief of Staff Larry D. Welch said recently, "has to be one of the 
most mysterious pieces of political chemistry we've seen." Meanwhile, James 
Baker wants to continue pursuing arms control. In this connection, arms-control 
director Gen. William F. Burns told me recently that the nearly completed START 
agreement will entail dismantling half of our existing nuclear submarines.

SIZING UP PRESIDENT BUSH: EFFECTIVE, NOT A DAREDEVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAYMOND PRICE, Raymond Price writes a syndicated column in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will not be a clone of President Reagan. But how different will 
he be, and in what ways? 
</P>
<P>
The short answer to the first question is very, and to the second, most. Not 
different in the basic objectives that he seeks, but different in the ways in 
which he pursues them. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan touched a certain mystic chord in the nation's heart. A Bush 
presidency will be more prose and less poetry. Reagan kept his eye on the goal. 
Bush will focus more on the means of reaching it. Reagan had an unparalleled 
ability to reach out and touch millions of Americans at once through 
television. Bush will reach out and touch many more people individually, and 
will track more closely the inner workings of his own Administration. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush has always had an adventurous spirit, but has followed it in a 
measured way. In World War II he became the Navy's youngest pilot, and a good 
one -- he won the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals -- but being 
a good combat pilot means being effective, not being a daredevil. After college 
he set out on his own for the oil fields of Texas, but carefully kept his ties 
to the banking world of the Northeast. He doesn't shrink from risks, but he 
prefers prudent risks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest influences on his life was his father, U.S. Sen. Prescott 
Bush, who was also a managing partner of the elite New York investment-banking 
firm of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
As a senator Pres Bush didn't make large waves. That wasn't his style. But he 
did win high respect from his Senate colleagues. He had a firm sense of right 
and wrong, and held himself to rigorous standards of personal conduct. An 
ardent internationalist, he helped persuade Dwight Eisenhower to get into the 
1952 presidential race. He was courteous, sometimes even courtly, with a 
conservative's instinctive distrust of government panaceas but also a firm 
belief that government exists to serve the public, not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Call it social conscience or a patrician sense of noblesse oblige, but the 
whole Bush family was imbued with a deeply rooted sense of public duty. To the 
Bush clan, public service is not someone else's responsibility. It's theirs. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush is not a theoretician. He does not have an intellectual turn of 
mind. He habitually deals with the concrete, not the abstract. He does have a 
keenly honed sense of how the world works. As U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations, head of the U.S. mission to China and director of the CIA, he saw the 
real world beyond the U.S. borders. And there is a down-home quality about his 
thought processes that creates real empathy with people on an individual basis 
while leaving his view of the bad guys and how they operate in the world 
remarkably unclouded. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this down-home quality and his own familiarity with Washington, the 
snake-oil salesmen who so heavily populate the Beltway area won't find him to 
be an easy sell. He has heard their pitches before. He knows the words -- and 
also the music. 
</P>
<P>
It's no coincidence that for years his closest political confidant and 
collaborator has been Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III. Baker is 
called a pragmatist. To the rigid ideologue a pragmatist is a person without 
principle. In the real world a pragmatist is often one who maneuvers to get as 
much of what his principles dictate as he can, then moves on to the next 
battle. Ideologues make better copy because they make livelier drama. But 
mixing in some pragmatism makes better policy. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, of course, the "inconsistencies" game will begin. Analysts not capable of 
holding two thoughts in their heads at the same time will point to separate 
Bush initiatives and declare them inconsistent with one another. Already the 
game has begun. To 90% of the Beltway crowd, kinder and gentler means one 
thing: fatter federal social programs funded by higher taxes. Bush doesn't 
believe that taxes are necessarily kind and gentle. 
</P>
<P>
But if people read his lips correctly, the new President should not be a font 
of major surprises. By and large, he is the sort who says what he means and 
means what he says and who doesn't feel that he has to raise his voice to make 
his point. By listening more closely, those who at first find his actions 
puzzling may in time find them less so.

doors of America's drug lords . . . watch the dope dealers fight back . . . 
Right after this commercial message. 
</P>
<P>
It has been called tabloid television, shows that titillate with little 
substance and much sensationalism. Critics scowl, but the ratings prove that 
this is what America likes to watch. It is presumed that there is a wide berth 
of believability between network television news and shows like Geraldo 
Rivera's assault on Al Capone's secret vault. It is also presumed that if "one 
picture is worth a thousand words," you can't argue with what five minutes' 
worth of videotape shows. Last weekend both suppositions were proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
We cut now to Long Beach, where a news crew for NBC's "Today Show" had secreted 
a camera and microphone in the car of a black man who claims that Long Beach 
police officers are racists. The NBC cameras were to capture proof of this on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
What we television viewers eventually saw was a confrontation between the 
police critic and a white officer who had stopped the car. We saw the man get 
out of the car, agitated and complaining, and the officer responding; the audio 
was heavily censored, bleeping out the officer's use of obscenities. Next the 
officer appeared to be pushing the man into a plate-glass store window. We 
heard the man screaming over silhouetted images of him apparently being 
manhandled by the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Was this a news report or tabloid television? Did NBC violate its own policy by 
staging, or coming close to staging, a news event? To the average viewer, the 
tape proves police abuse. Or does it? 
</P>
<P>
What didn't the tape show? 
</P>
<P>
Consider this incident from a police officer's point of view: 
</P>
<P>
Police make traffic stops probably hundreds of times a day throughout 
metropolitan Los Angeles. For most people who are stopped, it's a disquieting 
experience. Most people do not jump out of their cars when stopped by police, 
and most certainly don't become confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the case in Long Beach. The police critic had his own agenda. He 
got out of the car -- another man stayed in the driver's seat -- walked toward 
the two officers and, in keeping with his script, refused to obey their 
commands. This man, himself a police officer (now on a stress disability 
leave), knew from experience exactly how far to push the officers to evoke a 
dramatic response. He played his role perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
Most police officers in this situation will be asking themselves: Why is the 
guy doing this? Is he trying to divide our attention? Is he armed? What's the 
driver doing? Is he going to come out firing? 
</P>
<P>
While these life-threatening concerns are flashing through the officer's mind, 
the responsibility of the moment is to establish control of the situation. 
Talking tough, offensive as it sounds to most people, sometimes has its place. 
</P>
<P>
Next the videotape showed the storefront glass breaking. The police critic 
maintains that his face was pushed into the window, yet when he was interviewed 
the next day, close-up on camera, there was no evidence of injury to his face. 
The officer, however, cut his hand severely enough to require stitches. What, 
or who, shattered the window? The full videotape may -- or may not -- answer 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
The police critic's screaming voice was heard over murky pictures that 
supposedly showed the officer doing something to cause the man pain. Actually 
the shadowy images, filmed from across the dark street, only dramatically imply 
mistreatment. Unfortunately, NBC accepted it as factual. 
</P>
<P>
No, these pictures will need a lot more than a thousand words to explain, in an 
investigation that will dissect exactly what happened and how the officers 
handled it. If misconduct is determined, it is likely that the officer will be 
disciplined -- and probably sued by the police critic. NBC should cooperate and 
provide all the videotape that records the incident, not just the high-drama 
part that was broadcast. This is how a fair investigation is conducted -- with 
all of the available evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The unsettling thing about this event is that it gives police something else to 
worry about besides surviving the next "routine" traffic stop: Are they being 
set up for ambush by another edition of tabloid TV?

FROM HIGH HIGHS TO LOW LOWS, NANCY REAGAN HANDLED HER JOB WITH GRIT AND GRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman is a columnist in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years ago, as Ronald Reagan was being inaugurated President of the United 
States, the woman beside him caught the eyes of a dear friend in the crowd. At 
that second, she remembers, "both of us were thinking the same thing: Nothing 
would ever be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
She was right. Nancy Davis Reagan wasn't sworn in. She never held a public 
office. She wasn't paid a public salary. Nothing in the Constitution gave her 
power or place in the government. But from 1981 to 1989 she played the most 
public of private roles imaginable. She was the President's wife and the 
country's First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nancy is going home with the guy who brought her. 
</P>
<P>
What are the images that she will leave behind, the photographs in our national 
scrapbook? The devoted wife staring in fixed adoration as her husband spoke. 
The fashion plate in Adolfo dresses and borrowed jewels, a Second-Hand Rose. 
The activist against drugs who drove home a three-word message to American 
parents and kids: Just say no. The fiercely loyal worrier and star-gazer who 
made her husband's enemies her own. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan will be judged as President. Nancy will be judged, as women often 
are, by a much more elaborate set of criteria: wife, mother, presidential 
adviser, activist, woman. 
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning this First Lady had little of the Teflon coating that 
protected her husband's surfaces from the painful scratches of public 
criticism. She was labeled frivolous one year and intrusive another. She was 
called a clothes horse in the first term and a dragon in the end. She was 
criticized for caring about china and for caring about Russia. For being X-ray 
thin and for being power-hungry. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when all the images of women were in flux, the opinions about this 
woman were more than ambivalent. Those who admired her independent efforts 
against drugs often parodied her protective defense of her husband. Those who 
lauded her as a wife often lambasted her as an inner-circle adviser. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable if she looked out of that White House window and said, 
"Some days I have the feeling that if it's raining it must be my fault." 
</P>
<P>
Every First Lady has felt the heat of the White House lights. Dolley Madison 
was criticized for her snuff, Mary Lincoln for extravagance. Mrs. Roosevelt was 
called a busybody, Mrs. Truman reclusive. "Our expectations are unrealistic," 
says Sheila Tate, who was Nancy Reagan's press secretary for four years. "There 
is a sense that everything the First Lady does is subject to discussion. Most 
First Ladies go through a baptism by fire. I don't care how well prepared they 
think they are." 
</P>
<P>
Not even private problems stay on hold in the White House, nor do they stay 
private. A simple chronology of the life events in this First Family reads like 
an entry on a stress chart. 
</P>
<P>
In her time in non-office, Nancy Reagan had a husband shot and diagnosed with 
colon cancer. She lost her father and her mother and a breast to cancer. As a 
stepmother, she was for a time estranged from her stepson. As a mother, she has 
been alienated from a daughter whose novel was a thinly veiled attack. Through 
it all she was expected to perform perfectly as hostess and wife and drug 
czarina. 
</P>
<P>
We can leave it to the historians to divine her influence on the governing of 
America in these years. All she says is this: "It's silly to suggest that my 
opinion should not carry some weight with a man I've been married to for 35 
years." 
</P>
<P>
We can let the sociologists determine if she had a lasting influence on the use 
of drugs in America. The one thing that the First Lady has is the ability to 
focus attention. Now we will see how short our attention span is. 
</P>
<P>
But we don't need experts to assess what credit is due to the woman who married 
her job and carried it out under the hot, white lights that bathe Pennsylvania 
Avenue. She, too, has completed a term -- what Martha Washington once called 
"the lost years" -- in a role of enormous influence and little freedom. 
</P>
<P>
There is no official transition team for First Ladies -- just boxes and moving 
vans passing in the driveway. The spotlight has already shifted from the 
Reagans to the Bushes, from the size and style of one woman's family and dress 
to that of another. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Nancy Reagan's advice should be included in any non-job description 
passed from one resident to the next. "Once you're in the White House," she has 
said, "don't think it's going to be a glamorous fairy-tale life. It's very hard 
work, with high highs and low lows. Since you're under a microscope, everything 
is magnified. So just keep your perspective and your patience." 
</P>
<P>
The woman who is leaving on the President's arm did that. And she did it with 
grit and a goodly measure of grace.

CALABASAS HOTEL, OFFICE PROJECT TURNED DOWN FOR 3RD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite being scaled back by its owners, beautified by its designers and 
endorsed by its harshest critics, a proposed $150-million Calabasas hotel and 
office project was rebuffed again Thursday by Los Angeles County officials. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners refused for a third time to approve the 67-acre project 
planned by Ahmanson Commercial Development Co. for the southeast corner of 
Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas at the western edge of the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners said they want a guarantee that the project will be built in 
manageable phases before they allow construction to begin for 12 buildings and 
13 parking lots on the last major commercial site in exclusive Calabasas Park. 
</P>
<P>
The project has the backing of the influential Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn., 
which has spent two years negotiating with Ahmanson officials over such things 
as height, traffic and preservation of a hilly buffer zone between the project 
and nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Issues 
</P>
<P>
But three months ago, county planners refused to approve the project until 
questions about traffic control were answered. 
</P>
<P>
A month after that, Ahmanson officials returned with the answers about traffic 
control -- but were told that commissioners considered the project ugly and 
wanted it redesigned and reduced in size. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson executives returned Thursday with a new, pared-down design. In it, a 
proposed 13th building was dropped and nine proposed six-story buildings were 
lowered to five floors each. 
</P>
<P>
Architect William H. Fain, whose other projects include expansion of UC Irvine 
and a new 6,000-acre town in Hawaii, promised that the new look would include 
"view corridors" from Calabasas Road, extra landscaping and a "less formal, 
softened" layout of offices around a proposed 250-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Interchange 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson Vice President William Loadvine pledged that most of the project's 
future traffic would be funneled to a new $10-million Parkway Calabasas-Ventura 
Freeway interchange to which his firm is contributing $6 million. As a result, 
Calabasas' picturesque clapboard Old Town village would remain relatively 
unaffected by the project, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners, however, said they are still uneasy over the 
1.4-million-square-foot project. Although the redesign has trimmed 250,000 
square feet from the original proposal, the project's huge size still would 
require close coordination between the project's builders and the builders of 
the new interchange, commission member Betty Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom -- who previously called the project's design 
"somewhat bleak" -- said Ahmanson has made an effort to improve its looks. He 
said the commission's decision to delay consideration of the project until Feb. 
15 "will give us an opportunity to see the dust settle." 
</P>
<P>
Myra Turek, president of the homeowners association, said her group's support 
of the project also hinges on an Ahmanson guarantee that succeeding phases of 
construction will not begin if the initial phases cause traffic congestion in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and Feb. 15, however, "we would not be opposed to them chopping off 
more floors from those buildings," Turek said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Moving In 
</P>
<P>
The new delay could cause more headaches for Ahmanson. Residents have begun 
moving into a newly completed subdivision of $1-million homes on a hillside 
west of the project site, and newcomers are unhappy with the Ahmanson plans, 
said home buyer Donna Beebe. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Spring -- who moved to the new Westridge tract late last year after 
living for 17 years in an older Calabasas neighborhood -- said her new 
neighbors are eager to preserve "the charm of old Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
She said her neighbors will ask next month that planners shave Ahmanson's 
proposed buildings to three stories.

BERNSON SEEKS TO LIMIT BUILDING IN NORTHRIDGE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Development of new buildings in a large section of Northridge would be 
restricted until city planners can develop a parking and traffic-improvement 
plan for the area, under a proposal expected to win preliminary Los Angeles 
City Council approval Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes the area, proposed the building 
restrictions for the section bounded by Reseda Boulevard on the west, White Oak 
Avenue on the east, Chatsworth Street on the north and Parthenia Street on the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge, which is within the area, would not be affected because 
the city has no control over development of educational facilities on 
state-owned land, Bernson said. He added that he has worked with the university 
to alleviate parking and traffic problems, including developing a plan to 
extend Plummer Street through the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions would remain in effect until city planners can prepare a 
parking and traffic-improvement plan for the area and possibly new, permanent 
limitations on the size and types of permitted projects. Bernson noted that the 
development plan for the area has not been reviewed for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, who customarily defer to colleagues on matters in their 
districts, are expected Wednesday to order a draft of the restrictions' 
ordinance. The ordinance would have to go to the Planning Commission for public 
hearings, come back to the council and then go to Mayor Tom Bradley for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The area around the campus suffers from inadequate parking and from traffic 
congestion, Bernson said. "We want to make sure those things get solved in 
conjunction with any development that takes place in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the proposed ordinance is not a building moratorium. It would 
require property owners to obtain special approval for projects from the City 
Council, which could require parking and traffic improvements as a condition 
for approval. At present, council approval is not required if a project 
conforms to zoning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is in line with a growing practice in Los Angeles to require 
developers to reduce the traffic their projects would add to city streets. 
Traffic improvements are required before a new project can proceed in the Los 
Angeles International Airport area, Warner Center and Westwood.

MONTROSE DDT SITE STILL TOXIC; 
</P>
<P>
EPA FINDS WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION OF WATER BASINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contamination from a shuttered Harbor Gateway chemical plant that manufactured 
DDT for 35 years is more widespread than earlier believed and has tainted 
underground water basins as well as nearby homes and businesses, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has reported. 
</P>
<P>
Recent EPA tests found the banned pesticide and another dangerous chemical -- 
the solvent monochlorobenzene, or MCB -- in the Bellflower and Gage aquifers, 
which run underneath the site of the Montrose Chemical Corp. but do not supply 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
In both aquifers, MCB, which can cause liver and kidney damage, was much more 
prevalent than DDT, a suspected carcinogen. In the Bellflower aquifer, the one 
closest to the surface, the tests showed MCB at concentrations of 600,000 parts 
per billion -- 10,000 times the maximum standard proposed by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Two deeper aquifers -- the Lynwood and Silverado aquifers, which do feed into 
the drinking water supply -- have not yet been tested, although tests are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The lower aquifers are separated from the upper aquifers by a natural layer of 
clay, which water company officials say has generally protected the drinking 
water supply from contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assessing the Threat 
</P>
<P>
Johanna Miller, who is supervising cleanup of the site for the EPA, said 
officials are "confident that if it has reached a drinking water aquifer, the 
contamination would not have yet reached an actual drinking water well." 
</P>
<P>
The closest well is two miles away and has turned up no evidence of 
contamination, according to officials at the Dominguez Water Co., which 
maintains it, and the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District, 
which reviews tests conducted by all the water companies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
John Joham, district general manager, said he is not concerned about the EPA's 
findings at the former Montrose plant. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we want to keep our eye on it. We're not going to go ahead and 
ignore it and stick it in a file someplace and let it get dusty." 
</P>
<P>
The 13-acre Montrose site, on Normandie Avenue near the intersection of the 
Harbor and San Diego freeways, has been targeted for placement on the EPA's 
"Superfund" list of the worst toxic waste sites in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Concentration of DDT 
</P>
<P>
The Montrose Chemical Corp. manufactured DDT there from 1947 until 1982, when 
an EPA investigation revealed unusually high concentrations of DDT in surface 
water runoff and sediments leaving the property. The plant is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted since that time continue to reveal toxic waste on and off the 
site. Miller said that "through each phase of our investigation, we have 
discovered that the contamination has traveled farther than we would have 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said EPA officials were particularly surprised to find DDT in the two 
upper aquifers, because DDT is not generally thought to be soluble. However, it 
apparently mixed with the solvent MCB, which allowed it to spread. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ground water contamination, the most recent round of EPA 
tests revealed significant levels of DDT in dust and soil samples taken from 23 
homes and businesses near the Montrose site. The EPA report said the 
contamination is not serious enough to produce "any immediate health effects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Are Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
Area residents, however, are skeptical. And they are frustrated over the 
long-delayed cleanup of the site, which was originally scheduled for completion 
in 1986 but will not begin for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a wait-and-see game," complained longtime resident Bob 
Campbell. "They make tests, they say 'Yes there are contaminants there' . . . 
and then the next thing you know, they're going to make more tests."

THE PLAN WAS SIMPLE. SO WAS CARRYING IT OUT. THE PROBLEM WAS GETTING STARTED.

Michael Schuman wasn't trying to move a mountain. He just wanted to move a 
simple wooden bungalow to a park in Newhall that housed other historical 
buildings preserved by the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, "it might have been easier to move a mountain," said Schuman, 
a society member who was project co-director. "What was working was Murphy's 
Law, with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
It took several tries in recent weeks to successfully move the 64-year-old 
house from its original location in Valencia to the William S. Hart Park. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's move went off without a hitch. Getting started had been the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Schuman, who watched as the bungalow was finally moved before dawn Thursday, 
said the historical society had originally planned to move the house in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 12, society members had gathered to bid the house farewell and wait for 
movers to whisk it off on its five-mile trip down Magic Mountain Parkway and 
San Fernando Road to the park. They waited and waited. Then they waited some 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"When the mover didn't show up, we got suspicious," said society member Carol 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone call revealed that San Joaquin Movers, a Bakersfield company, also 
had been contracted to relocate a historical house in the Antelope Valley. 
"When he should have come here, he went to Palmdale," Schuman said. 
</P>
<P>
The next time, the move was canceled by rain. Then there was the time the mover 
couldn't get over the Grapevine because of snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that as a junior high principal I had experienced every frustration 
known to man," said Schuman, a retired educator. "I thoroughly believed that 
until I came up with this house." 
</P>
<P>
The bungalow, which was built in 1925 by Southern California Edison Co., was 
one of the few houses of the era not destroyed when the St. Francis Dam 
collapsed and flooded the valley in 1928, Schuman said. The historical society 
plans to restore the house and turn it into a museum about the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the house was finally in place. Schuman was relieved. "I knew one 
day we would move it."

was placed on new site Thursday. TORU KAWANA / Los Angeles Times

BODY IDENTIFIED AS GRANADA HILLS WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abody found floating in San Pedro Channel was identified Thursday as that of a 
50-year-old Granada Hills woman who had been missing since Christmas Eve, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Margo Barbera was spotted Wednesday afternoon by a Catalina Express 
helicopter pilot shuttling tourists between Catalina Island and San Pedro, 
police said. The body was retrieved from the channel about 11 miles south of 
San Pedro harbor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbera's family had reported her missing Christmas Eve, Detective Robert 
Iannessa said. Her car was found 10 days later near Point Mugu in Ventura 
County, he said. Authorities speculated that she may have entered the water 
near where her car was parked and that her body may have floated to the spot 
where it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
There were no indications of foul play, authorities said. An investigation was 
continuing, and the Los Angeles coroner's office had scheduled an autopsy.

REPAIRS TO CLOSE RAMPS ON VENTURA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several on- and off-ramps of the Ventura Freeway will be closed for repairs 
this weekend, according to the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
From 9 p.m. Friday to 5:30 a.m. Monday, Caltrans will close all De Soto Avenue 
ramps, both eastbound and westbound. The Tampa Avenue westbound and eastbound 
off-ramps and Ventura Boulevard eastbound on-ramp at Vanalden Avenue will be

MAN GETS PRISON TERM FOR KILLING BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man was sentenced to eight years in prison Thursday for fatally 
shooting his brother after an argument. 
</P>
<P>
Crispin Ahumada Hernandez, 38, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 
Dec. 15 shooting of Pedro Hernandez, 30, in their Woodman Avenue apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, who lived in the apartment with three other men, had been 
arguing, police said. Hernandez shot his brother in the upper body with a 
.38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the shooting, Hernandez admitted to his three roommates that he had 
killed his brother, police said. Hernandez said his brother had asked to be 
shot, the roommates told investigators. Police said they found no sign of a 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a part-time janitor, was originally charged with murder. But he 
pleaded guilty to the lesser offense after he and prosecutors agreed to a plea 
bargain.

LION WOMEN AT HOME FOR LEAGUE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount University women's basketball team will be in action at 
home for the first time in more than three weeks, playing host to Gonzaga 
University tonight and the University of Portland on Saturday in West Coast 
Athletic Conference action. Both games begin at 7:30 in Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are 9-7 overall (the only winning record among the eight conference 
teams) and 1-1 in the WCAC. In their conference opening weekend, the Lions won, 
57-56, at Santa Clara but lost, 69-60, at USF. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Lynn Flanagan leads the Lions at 11.9 points per game, followed by center 
Tricia Gibson and forward Regan O'Hara at 9.3 each and guard Kristen Bruich at 
8.3. O'Hara had 12 rebounds in each game last weekend. The Lions, who have lost 
three of their last four games -- all on the road -- are averaging 63.7 points 
while allowing 60.9. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga, the defending conference champion, leads the WCAC at 2-0 despite a 
6-10 season record. However, the Bulldogs are 0-4 on the road. Gonzaga forward 
Carla Curfman was named WCAC Player of the Week for her 28-point game against 
San Diego. Overall, guard Jennifer Mountain leads Gonzaga in scoring at 15 
points per game, followed by Curfman at 13.4. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, 3-12 overall and 1-1 in the WCAC, is last in the WCAC in scoring, 
averaging 58 points. The Pilots, 0-5 on the road, may be without injured point 
guard Ursula Lovely. ALAN DROOZ

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: COURT BATTLE LOOMS FOR BROTHERS IN LIONS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Drooz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will be brother against brother Saturday when Loyola Marymount plays a 
conference basketball game at the University of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Portland is off to a disastrous start at 1-14, but one of the Pilots' bright 
spots has been the play of guard Josh Lowery, its leading scorer. The Lions 
have freshman Terrell Lowery, a backup point guard of great promise and the 
Portland star's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
When they face off, Terrell Lowery said, it will continue a lifelong rivalry. 
Josh is three years older. Growing up in Oakland, Terrell said, "we played 
against each other all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Josh, a 6-3 redshirt junior who transferred out of San Diego State, is the only 
Pilot averaging double figures, scoring 14.5 points per game. He's not shy 
about putting it up. "He's more of a flat-out shooter," said Terrell, a 
combination point and shooting guard. "He'll pass it, but he'd rather shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Terrell, 6-1 1/2, is averaging 5.8 points and plays sporadically in Coach Paul 
Westhead's rotation but has had good games, with a high of 18 against U.S. 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Josh is highly regarded as a baseball shortstop and has been drafted twice by 
the Cleveland Indians, after high school and again last year. Terrell favors 
basketball. "We're different types of people," Terrell said. "I liked to do 
different things. I played second base, he played shortstop. He played baseball 
in the summer. I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Terrell has been following his older brother. On Saturday, they 
finally end up on equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery isn't the only Loyola player with a talented brother in the same sport. 
Lions star Hank Gathers doesn't have to go far to check out brother Derrick, 
who is having an outstanding year at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick, a 6-3 guard, leads the Matadors and is among California Collegiate 
Athletic Conference scoring leaders with an 18.5 average. Hank, elder by 10 
months, often played on teams with his brother in their native Philadelphia and 
would have dearly loved to see him in a Loyola uniform. Derrick played at Santa 
Monica City College last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very good player. He's a very good three-point shooter (35 for 81 this 
season). He could certainly play here," said Hank, whose exploits have tended 
to overshadow Derrick. Hank leads the NCAA in scoring and rebounding, but the 
6-7 forward said he hates to have to play against Derrick: "He's one of the 
best defensive players I've ever seen. I wouldn't want him sticking me. He's 
like (Oklahoma star) Mookie Blaylock -- he's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Who would win a duel of Lowery brothers versus the Gathers? "We'd win," Terrell 
Lowery said somewhat uncertainly. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers laughed and said: "I don't think it would be much of a comparison. 
We'd just post 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
After a shooting slump that stretched through several games, Loyola guard Jeff 
Fryer shot the lights out against DePaul last Saturday. His 42 points tied him 
with Greg Goorjian for most points scored by a Loyola guard. It's also the 
third-highest total in a Loyola game. His performance earned him West Coast 
Athletic Conference Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer, who has been the focus of opposing defenses lately and entered the game 
shooting less than 40%, hit nine of 14 shots from three-point range and 13 of 
22 overall. Several of his baskets came from beyond the NBA stripe in Rosemont 
Horizon, legitimate 25-footers. One time, when Fryer was near the DePaul bench, 
Blue Demons Coach Joey Meyer told him, "Open your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
It's the second time Fryer set a personal best on national television. He 
scored 28 points in the final game last season against North Carolina. Each 
time, on CBS-TV, Fryer was the Chevrolet player of the game in a losing cause, 
which Coach Paul Westhead humorously noted: 
</P>
<P>
"Fryer's got two Chevies in the garage now. I just wish we'd win a game." 
(Players don't actually get a gift. Chevrolet makes a donation to the school in 
their name.) 
</P>
<P>
Streak Starter: It may just be coincidence, but since Kevin Shaw's insertion 
into the Cal State Dominguez Hills starting basketball lineup, the Toros had 
not lost going into Thursday's game against UC Riverside. Shaw, a forward who 
has spent most of the last two seasons on the bench awaiting his chance, has 
played more minutes in the last five games than in his previous two years. The 
defense-minded 6-3 junior has averaged three points and four rebounds a game 
since he became a starter. Shaw got his chance when Kenyatta Kalisana went out 
with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA made several more entries into the record book after Loyola 
Marymount's recent 162-144 victory over U.S. International. Along with the 
Lions producing the first 90-point half in NCAA history (93) and the teams 
combining for the most total points (306), the game set marks for: 
</P>
<P>
* Most players on one team with 30 or more points: three (Loyola -- Hank 
Gathers 40, Enoch Simmons 38, Jeff Fryer 30). 
</P>
<P>
* Most total players with 30 or more points: five (USIU's Gary Williams had 40, 
Demetrius Laffitte 34. 
</P>
<P>
* Most shots taken in a game: 245 (Loyola 124, USIU 121); 
</P>
<P>
* Most points ever against a Division I team (Loyola's 162. Loyola and 
Nevada-Las Vegas have scored 164 against non-Division I opponents); 
</P>
<P>
* Most points ever by a losing team (USIU's 144, erasing old mark of 142 set by 
Utah State in triple overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA was also happy to report that the new records eliminated the need, in 
several cases, to distinguish between overtime and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Erasers are being kept handy. The teams meet again Jan. 31 at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills point guard Robert Barksdale has averaged 16.3 points and five 
assists and shot 52% in his last eight games. In that streak, the sophomore has 
made 12 of 23 shots from three-point range, 26 of 30 free throws and has 
committed only 11 turnovers . . . Loyola is the only basketball team to score 
more than 100 points against DePaul in Joey Meyer's five years as head coach. 
The Lions have done it twice this season -- and lost both games . . . With 
1,105 career points, Enoch Simmons is five points away from moving into the 
13th spot on Loyola's career scoring list. With 288 points this season, Simmons 
has topped his previous season high.

NORTHRIDGE OFFENSE FAILS TO CLICK IN 86-59 LOSS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't so long ago that a victory didn't seem like it was enough for Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
If it didn't come with the Matadors scoring in triple figures, then it wasn't 
quite good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Loyola Marymount syndrome: In a 5-game span, CSUN exceeded 100 
points 4 times. 
</P>
<P>
My, how times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Against Cal State Bakersfield at Civic Arena on Thursday, the Northridge 
offense sputtered all night -- with the exception of an 8-minute span in the 
second half, and by that time, it was too late. The 19th-ranked Roadrunners 
were already -- beep, beep -- running wild on their way to an 86-59 blowout of 
the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
In this one, Northridge struggled long and hard just to reach double figures. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's 10th point didn't come until 11:26 had passed. A jump hook by Todd 
Bowser made the score 22-10. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser's basket, which accounted for one-third of his point total, was the only 
scoring Northridge did during a span of more than 10 minutes in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, Bakersfield registered 23. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? It is easier to chronicle what went right for CSUN, which 
dropped to 1-1 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., 10-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
To keep it short: hardly anything. 
</P>
<P>
"They took us right out of everything we wanted to do," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy 
said. "They truly dominated us in every facet." 
</P>
<P>
Facets such as . . . 
</P>
<P>
Shooting percentage: Advantage Bakersfield, 55.7% to 32.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Free-throw shooting: Bakersfield, 80% (16 of 20) to 44.4% (8 of 18). 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding: Bakersfield, 47-36. 
</P>
<P>
The only category in which Northridge had the edge was the only one in which it 
prefers to lose -- turnovers, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, the preseason favorite to win the CCAA, evened its conference 
record at 1-1 and improved to 12-3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the week, Roadrunner Coach Pat Douglass was telling Bakersfield 
sportswriters that Northridge would be the team to beat for the conference 
championship. He altered his tune ever so slightly after watching his team turn 
CSUN into a Wile E. Coyote divot. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think Northridge is one of the top three teams in the conference," he 
said. "This just proves that if we play well, we can play with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge tried to make a game of it with a mild rally midway through the 
second half, shaving 10 points off what had been a 23-point margin with 16 
minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Becker hit a jump shot to make it 66-53 with 9:53 remaining, but the 
Matadors turned the ball over 6 of their next 9 trips down the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Only 4 minutes after narrowing Bakersfield's lead to 13, CSUN again trailed by 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said that the Matadors simply tried to rush things too much. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is controlled frenzy and offense is all poise," he said. "You have to 
separate the two." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's play in the first half illustrated Cassidy's point. While 
creating havoc on defense, the Roadrunners seemed to have no problem shifting 
into an offensive mode. 
</P>
<P>
Roadrunner guards Wade Green and Noel Nash managed to penetrate the Matador 
defense -- pun intended -- both to score and pass off. 
</P>
<P>
Green had 11 points and 11 assists. Nash had 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's freshman center, Von Bennett, scored a game-high 18 points and 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser, CSUN's center, had 6 points and 7 rebounds. Derrick Gathers had 17 
points to lead the Matadors and Darren Matsubara added 13.

VALLEY FOURSOME EMBROILED IN CRISIS AT SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A day after asking himself "should I stay or should I go," Damon Greer offered 
no apologies for taking part in a San Jose State player boycott of a Big West 
Conference game at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, a freshman point guard and 1988 graduate of Cleveland High, is one of 10 
players who left the team Wednesday after complaining of harsh treatment and 
negativity surrounding the program of Coach Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Sean Davis, a 1987 graduate of El Camino Real, also joined 
the walkout. Kevin Logan, a non-scholarship player and a 1988 graduate of 
Westlake High, and starting center Jan Svoboda of Glendale, a senior, decided 
to remain with the team. San Jose State lost to Fullerton, 82-60, the Spartans' 
sixth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said that past player complaints to administrators had fallen on deaf 
ears and that previous attempts to foster a better player-coach relationship 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the first group to stand up to him," said Greer, a reserve who has 
played in 11 games for the 5-12 team. "I've talked to other players who wanted 
to but didn't make the move. We did and we stick by it." 
</P>
<P>
The boycotters left school -- which is on a semester break -- Thursday and 
spent the day discussing their plans with a San Francisco attorney, Paul 
Menzoni of the Melvin Belli law firm. Greer said that the players who left will 
not return long as Berry remains. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has their own coaching style," Greer said. "We're sick of the way he 
comes down on us. Our confidence is totally shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to enjoy this. Everybody here comes from a good program -- I 
came from Cleveland -- we all know what it takes to win, the sacrifices you 
need to make. We know what hard work is, but we don't need this." 
</P>
<P>
Several boycotting players said in a press conference Wednesday that Berry's 
verbal tirades and negative reinforcement made practices unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you just need a pat on the back," Greer said. "When it's all 
negative, negative, negative, negative, you start to believe it, that you can't 
do it, that there's something wrong with you." 
</P>
<P>
Greer said that the group had not spoken with school administrators since 
Wednesday and had no idea whether their scholarships are at stake. Sports 
information director Lawrence Fan said that all 10 players boycotting the team 
are on scholarship. The boycotting players' athletic scholarship status may be 
determined in the next week, university spokeswoman Karen Rosenzweig said. 
</P>
<P>
Berry on Thursday blamed the frustration of losing close games and faulty 
guidance for the players' problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They got some bad advice from the people they listened to," Berry told the 
Associated Press. "The negative was really something they cling to." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Berry and the team broke down when all 14 members met 
with the coach Tuesday afternoon to air their grievances. The following day, 
Greer said, some players reneged on their promise not to play, including Logan 
and Svoboda. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something that just sort of happened," Greer said. "We all looked at it 
very carefully and went in as a team. Everybody was together and then the four 
that are down (in Fullerton) now just sort of trickled off in their own 
direction after speaking with the coach." 
</P>
<P>
Logan and Svoboda joined Dwain Daniels and Tom Desiano as players who did not 
go along with the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Randy Hoffman said that Berry would not be fired based on 
player complaints and would remain until the end of the season. Hoffman said in 
a press release that it was not the university's policy to dismiss coaches 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said that he would continue the season despite the player walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Greer indicated that none of the boycotting players have contacted others 
schools about transferring and added that the players would meet today to 
discuss their options.

BELL-JEFF, NOTRE DAME TO SQUARE OFF IN LEAGUE'S INAUGURAL SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It might not be worthy of Super Bowl-type hype, but Saturday night's San 
Fernando Valley League showdown between Bell-Jeff and visiting Notre Dame 
promises to be a super shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
The first-year rivals in the fledgling league are 3-0 in league play and 
playing at the top of their games. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff (15-1) is led by 4 senior scoring threats -- Nick Sanderson (22.9 
points a game), Greg Dunn (15.9), Chris Dyer (12.1) and Ray Witt (10.3). 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (9-8) is coming off a 101-40 thumping of former Del Rey League rival 
Alemany, and although the Knights have struggled to surpass the .500 mark, 
Coach Mick Cady says that the hard times are in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys," Cady said emphatically, "are still hungry to gain a little 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Senior forwards Brian Jones and Ken Hicks have dominated for the Knights. Jones 
is averaging 25.2 points a game. Hicks, who has recovered from a preseason 
ankle injury, is averaging 19.8 over 7 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones is going to shoot it, Hicks is going to shoot it," Bell-Jeff Coach Joe 
Dunn said. "You got to pay attention to both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Other league coaches are paying close attention to the 7 p.m. game. The winner 
will be the front-runner for the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll either be a close game that can go either way, or Notre Dame will blow 
them out," Chaminade Coach Mike Lynn said. "But with Bell-Jeff, you've got to 
be able to score because they can score from anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Said St. Genevieve Coach Scott Smith: "I think Notre Dame is a little stronger, 
but I think it will be close."

of those cute mascots that are all the rage. The problem is that Simi Valley's 
true mascot, the Pioneer, isn't all that cuddly -- it looks more like Davey 
Crockett after a 3-day hike. 
</P>
<P>
So, this season, a 6-foot chicken, dressed beak to claw in yellow feathers, 
struts around Simi Valley's gym and high-fives players, schmoozes with the 
cheerleaders and generally whips the place into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the most humorous part of the Simi Valley chicken's shake and bake is 
when it merely stands in proximity to Mike Wawryk, the Pioneers' 6-5 center. 
Wawryk and the chicken, which also dons a Simi Valley uniform, wear the same 
number -- 31. The chicken, however, wears an away uniform, which brought the 
inevitable question to Wawryk: "Do you switch uniforms on the road?" 
</P>
<P>
Wawryk said that they didn't share Pioneer duds and added, "I think it's nice. 
I thought it was funny when I first saw it." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Wawryk gets a little ribbing from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
No panic yet: Three losses in 5 Marmonte League games for Newbury Park have 
been somewhat of a surprise for a team that was 9-2 entering league play, but 
the Panthers are not fretting. In fact, a mention of the dry spell brought only 
a promise from forward Wayne Cook, the team leader in scoring and rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be there," he said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
By there, Cook meant in the race for the league title. But to get there, 
Newbury Park must start in Camarillo, where tonight the Panthers will play the 
Scorpions (4-1 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten bound: Chaminade lineman Steve Rosen (6-3, 245) has verbally committed 
to attend Northwestern after visiting the Big Ten school last week. Rosen also 
had been recruited by New Mexico State, Rutgers and the Naval Academy but made 
a decision after his only visit. 
</P>
<P>
The frown of renown: There is a more than passing resemblance between Cleveland 
forward Bobby McRae and former NBA star Maurice Lucas, whose scowl was as 
legendary as his bruising style of play. 
</P>
<P>
First, there are the facial similarities. "I never really thought about it that 
way, but I can see it," Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell said. "I guess he does 
look a little like Lucas." 
</P>
<P>
Second, there is the intimidation factor. Like Lucas, who before his retirement 
last season was often called the meanest man in the NBA, McRae has the look of 
a hit man when on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby has the ultimate game face," Braswell said. "When he's on the court, he 
does not smile. He's very intense." 
</P>
<P>
McRae, a 6-4 junior, is also Cleveland's best defensive player and routinely 
guards the opposition's best front-line player. He has been no offensive 
liability, however. McRae has made 28 of 54 field-goal attempts (53%) and is 
averaging 7.9 rebounds a game while playing in the shadow of Division I-bound 
Warren Harrell (New Mexico State) and Lucious Harris (Cal State Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
When Braswell looks at McRae, he is reminded of another Cleveland player known 
for his intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think he looks like Trevor," Braswell said of 1986 graduate 
Trevor Wilson, now a starting forward at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Missing Lancers: Perusers of basketball box scores may have noticed that guard 
Nate Conner and forward Sean Watkins did not start for Grant (10-3, 2-1) in 
last week's 57-51 victory over Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Although Conner and Watkins were benched for disciplinary reasons, neither 
player was really in Lancer Coach Howard Levine's doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing drastic," Levine said. "But both players missed a practice last 
week. . . . We have a rule that if you miss a practice, you don't start in the 
next game." 
</P>
<P>
Conner and Watkins both started in Grant's 58-38 victory over Van Nuys last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Add Grant: Levine has been pleased with the recent play of junior forward Setro 
Terzian, who scored 19 points and grabbed 27 rebounds in 2 games last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He's finally starting to assert himself," Levine said. "He took it upon 
himself to take the initiative at the offensive end of the court against Reseda 
and it showed."

<P>
A Santa Monica Bay halibut bite exploded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Spray from Redondo Sportfishing caught 31 flatties. Capt. John Ridder 
said during every drift move he made, anglers using live squid and cut squid 
had hook-ups. 
</P>
<P>
All the legal fish weighed from 6 to 27 pounds, and several larger fish came 
unbuttoned from the hooks and parted lines. 
</P>
<P>
On the local shallow rock fish front, anglers are scoring on good-size sculpin 
that have invaded in near-record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Angler Earl Larson of San Pedro was catching two sculpin at a time aboard the 
Matt Walsh out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing and brought up an albino spotted 
sculpin, an unusual catch in California waters. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was put into a bait receiver at the landing for safe keeping to be 
delivered to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. Unfortunately for the museum, the rare 
fish flipped out of the tank and escaped into L.A. Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The rock cod outer islands boats on two-day trips have been consistently 
hauling in limits of reds and lings. 
</P>
<P>
The King Harbor Marlin Club's 17th annual awards banquet for its 1988 
tournament was held Saturday night in Torrance.

240-pound, 8-ounce fish. 
</P>
<P>
The award for largest marlin went to Stan Eckland of Torrance, who caught a 
187-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Jenny Austin of Torrance caught a 107-pound, 8-ounce 
marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Junior angler award went to Kyle Shorene of Hermosa Beach for most fish and 
weight caught. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hawks of Torrance received the albacore award for his 25-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
An open house will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday to inspect the new 
22nd Street Landing in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle manufacturers will display 1989 products. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Javier Gonzales of Gardena, on a two-day trip at San Nicholas Island aboard the 
Aztec, coaxed a rock cod out of the rocks. The cow awarded him the whopper of 
the week when it weighed in at 27 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Asatourian of Torrance won the jackpot on the Sea Spray with his 
27-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Blalock of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Pacifica at Tanner Bank, caught 
a 22-pound ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lindstrom of Redondo Beach, fishing aboard the Blackjack at Hidden Reef, 
won the jackpot with his 19-pound ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Richards of Hermosa Beach, fishing aboard the Sharpshooter in Santa Monica 
Bay, caught a 13-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished Twin Roads and anglers 
caught 60 sculpin, 11 halibut and seven sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip fished the bay and returned with 56 sculpin, 45 
sand bass and 10 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O shallow rock cod trip accounted for 295 rock cod and one cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished the Sunset Beach area for 53 
sculpin, 31 halibut and 11 rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Pat Higgins of Lawndale used plastic worms to catch an 11 1/2-pound bass at 
Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Bena Nishinuro of Hawthorne used a marshmallow and caught a limit of trout at

BURNHAM TO DEFEND TITLE IN SUNKIST 500-YARD RUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa will be the featured high school performer at the 
Sunkist Invitational indoor track and field meet at the Sports Arena today, but 
the boys' seeded 2-mile run could offer the most talented field of the meet, 
which starts at 4:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, Track and Field News' national female high school athlete of the year 
in 1988, will be matched against Angela Rolfe of Dorsey and Roslyn Mack of St. 
Francis (Mountain View) in the 500-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is the defending state champion in the 100 and 200 meters and Rolfe is 
the defending state champion in the 400. Mack placed fourth in the 400 in the 
1988 state championships at Cerritos College in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' 2-mile run will feature Brian Grosso of Walled Lake, Mich., Bryan 
Dameworth of Agoura and Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso won the Kinney national high school cross-country championships in San 
Diego on Dec. 10 while Dameworth placed fourth and Williamson finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hartman of Canyon and Craig Lawson of Granada Hills, seventh and 10th in 
the state Division I cross-country championships, also will compete. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley will renew his rivalry with 
Eric Smith of Redlands in the 880-yard run and Todd Lewis of Burbank will 
challenge Francis O'Neill of San Pasqual High in Escondido in the seeded mile. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman defeated Smith for the Southern Section 4-A Division 800-meter title 
last June, but Smith (fifth) finished ahead of Bateman (eighth) in the state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis placed second in the 1,600 in last year's Southern Section 3-A 
championships and O'Neill placed fourth in the state championships in the same 
event.

Sun Microsystems Inc. said net income for the second quarter more than doubled 
to $29.5 million. Revenue rose 91% to $448.3 million. The Mountain View, 
Calif., high-tech firm said the shortage of memory chips, crucial to Sun's 
high-performance workstations and servers, abated somewhat toward the end of 
the quarter. "Yet, despite the increase in production and shipments resulting 
from improved component availability, the high rate of incoming orders in the 
second quarter again resulted in the largest quarter-end backlog in Sun's 
history," the firm said.

Charles Schwab Corp. reported that its profit for 1988 fell 70% to $7.4 
million, compared to that of 1987. Revenue fell 16% to $392.2 million for the 
year, mainly because of reduced retail participation in the stock market, the 
San Francisco-based discount broker said. For the fourth quarter, the firm 
reported profit of $600,000, contrasted with a loss of $14 million for the 
year-ago period.

Digital Equipment's second-quarter net income fell 15% from the year-ago period 
to $280 million. Revenue rose to $3.2 billion, up 14%. The Maynard, Mass., 
firm, which is the nation's second-largest computer maker, said the results 
were in part because of a period of heavy investment in new programs and 
business expansion and a 28% revenue gain from international business.

Caterpillar Inc.'s earnings slipped 4% in the fourth quarter to $163 million 
despite better sales, but it still managed to earn a record profit for the full 
year. Even with the dip in quarterly profit, Caterpillar said 1988 profit was a 
record $616 million, up from $350 million in 1987. The Peoria, Ill.-based 
heavy-machinery manufacturer said higher costs in the fourth quarter came from 
a new labor contract, higher employment, factory modernization investment and 
more expensive materials. During the final quarter, revenue rose 17% to $2.66 
billion. For the year, Caterpillar said annual sales rose to $10.43 billion 
from $8.18 billion in 1987.

PEOPLE: GE APPROVES SHAKE-UP AT KIDDER PEABODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Electric Co. has announced a management shuffle at its Kidder Peabody 
Group, the Wall Street investment house that has provided its share of problems 
since GE took control in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
GE Capital, the company's financial services division, stated that Michael A. 
Carpenter, an executive vice president of GE Capital, has been named president 
and chief executive of Kidder Peabody Group. Silas S. Cathcart, a former GE 
director brought in as an interim chief executive in 1987, will stay on as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Max C. Chapman Jr., a longtime Kidder employee who had been running the group 
from his position as president of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., the broker-dealer 
unit, resigned to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
Kidder suffered a major blow to its reputation when it became embroiled in the 
Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandal. The 124-year-old firm agreed in 1987 to 
pay $25.3 million to settle civil charges with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The episode also prompted GE to make aggressive management changes at the firm 
in response to what it perceived as management weaknesses that led to Kidder's 
involvement in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The management shake-ups at Kidder are seen by many as highlighting the 
problems that can occur when smokestack companies try to bring new types of 
business into their corporate fold, as has happened frequently this decade. 
</P>
<P>
GE management generally has gotten excellent marks for the handling of its 
expansion into financial services. But analysts say some clashes are 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for industrial companies to own Wall Street financial firms. They 
drive the creative people out. Creative people feel limited, suffocated," said 
one analyst, who asked not to be named.

Profit taking and a weaker dollar took the bloom off a brief blue chip rally 
Thursday, holding Wall Street to a marginally higher close just short of its 
immediate pre-crash level. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues rose 0.36 to 2,239.11 after 
picking up 24.11 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The widely followed barometer had a session high of 2,254.64 Thursday -- the 
first time it has surpassed the level where it stood before the October, 1987, 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day before the crash, the average closed at 
2,246.74. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to 4 in New York 
Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 192.03 million shares, up from 
187.54 million in the previous session, and the highest NYSE volume so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Underlying Health' 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there were still signs of strength on Wall Street, and they 
expected the market's 1989 rally to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's entitled to at least a day or two of flatness," said Michael 
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. He pointed to the advance-decline 
ratio as a indication of the market's underlying health. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported Thursday that its consumer price index rose 0.3% 
in December, bringing the increase in the index for all of 1988 to 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The latest inflation report was lower than most economists had predicted and 
contributed to the positive atmosphere on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
However, brokers say the market's strength has not seemed to derive from 
economic news, but rather from a gradual easing of the fears that have 
persisted that the Federal Reserve will move interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9%, up from 8.938% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, stock prices closed lower in Tokyo, giving back a portion 
of the previous day's advance to record highs. The Nikkei 225-share index fell 
43.15 points to 31,311.40. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a brisk rally faltered as Wall Street turned mixed and investors 
paused to assess the outlook, dealers reported. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed up 18.7 points to a new post-crash high of 1,910.8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Central banks slammed the dollar lower Thursday, cooling a rally that had 
brought the U.S. currency to its highest levels since early October. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said one round of dollar selling by nine central banks 
was unsuccessful, but a second round drove the dollar lower against most 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar sales were accompanied by West Germany's central bank raising two key 
interest rates, a step intended to make yields on German securities more 
attractive and keep investors from switching from marks to dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar had gotten as high as 129.8 Japanese yen and 1.88 marks before the 
successful attack by the central banks at mid-morning in New York. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the dollar had risen strongly despite two negative reports: a 
bigger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and a record Japanese trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was due for a pullback, at least a temporary one, said Frank Conte, 
vice president for foreign exchange at Barclays Bank in New York.

REMEMBERING AMY IN HEAD AND HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read several pieces by Theroux in the past, most of which I have 
enjoyed. However, I have begun to notice a disturbing pattern in her writing -- 
she likes to play God. 
</P>
<P>
The first story that comes to mind is one about a severely deformed puppy born 
to the Theroux's dog. Rather than leave the poor creature with its mother and 
littermates, where sustenance and comfort could be provided, she removed it to 
some back corner of her utility closet to die a lonely and probably painful 
death. Humane euthanasia at the vet's was apparently never considered. 
</P>
<P>
Now again, Theroux has taken it upon herself to pressure two desperate young 
people into a decision regarding the life or death of an infant. She can't even 
seem to allow the child's parents to have a private conversation -- she 
eavesdropped when asked to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure Theroux is well-meaning, but she always seems to feel that she knows 
best and is going to see to it that her will prevails, a will that prefers to 
get rid of whatever is ugly, undesirable or unpleasant, like the puppy.

EXPLAINING THE REASON FOR ADJUVANT THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: The papers have been carrying stories about how women with breast 
cancer should have adjuvant therapy. Will you please explain what this is. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You are probably referring to a National Cancer Institute Clinical 
Alert, which suggested that systemic adjuvant therapy may be beneficial if it 
is begun within six weeks of removal of a breast cancer. Adjuvant refers to 
treatment given in addition to the primary treatment. In the case of breast 
cancer, surgery is the primary treatment; adjuvant therapy may consist of 
radiation, chemotherapy or hormones. 
</P>
<P>
In general, physicians have used systemic adjuvant therapy in breast cancer 
patients whose lymph nodes contained cancer cells at the time they underwent 
surgery. Women whose breast cancer had not spread to lymph nodes generally did 
not receive systemic adjuvant therapy. 
</P>
<P>
I would advise any of my readers who may be concerned about these stories to 
discuss their feelings with their physician.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: CLUES TO FAMILY CHURCH AFFILIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans, being a mixture of national and ethnic groups, differ greatly when 
it comes to religion. Knowing the ethnic origins of your families will provide 
clues to their likely church affiliation. However, other factors must be 
considered when you begin to search for church records. 
</P>
<P>
Where your families lived is important -- and when. For example, if you have an 
early New England line, they probably were Congregationalists, Baptists or 
Quakers; if you descend from pioneers of the Middle Colonies, your families may 
have been Dutch Reformed, Lutheran, Quaker, Presbyterian or Catholic. Possibly 
they were Mennonites, Amish, Moravians, Baptists, Methodists or another 
Christian denomination. On the other hand, if yours are Deep South roots, your 
ancestors may have belonged to the Church of England or Anglican, which was 
called Protestant Episcopal after the Revolution, or they could have been 
Quakers, Moravians, Baptists, Presbyterian or Methodists. 
</P>
<P>
Most Colonial Dutch families belonged to the Dutch Reformed or were 
Anabaptists; Scandinavia and northern Germany ancestors were usually Lutheran 
or Reformed Lutheran. Swiss and German families from the Rhineland, Westphalia 
and Holstein often were Pietists, Anabaptists, Mennonites, Amish or Moravians. 
French ancestors may have been Catholic or Huguenots. 
</P>
<P>
In those denominations that practiced infant baptism (christening) you will 
find the full name of the person baptized, his age or date of birth, the place 
of birth or christening, names of parents, places of residence and the names 
and relationships (sometimes) of witnesses or sponsors. Some church records do 
not include birth or baptism entries -- but you may find other information such 
as admissions, removals, certificates of membership, communicant lists, lists 
of ministers and disciplinary proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Some church records include marriage records. Special marriage registers were 
kept by many churches, but others merely listed marriage information among 
other entries in church books. Even if the church records do not include 
marriage information, careful reading of church minutes will enable you to 
pinpoint an approximate date if you note when Amanda Jones ceases to be 
mentioned and John Henderson and his wife, Amanda, are. 
</P>
<P>
Church records also often include information pertaining to death, burials, 
funerals and memorials. 
</P>
<P>
Start your search for church records in the microfilmed records of the LDS 
(Mormon) Family History Library. This library has the greatest single 
collection of church (all denominations) records in the world, and through its 
hundreds of branch libraries you may borrow via interlibrary these films. 
</P>
<P>
Determine the likely church of your ancestors. Next, study the history of the 
particular locality where they lived. Determine which churches existed at that 
time. Most local histories will include information about the early churches 
with formation dates of churches in that town or county. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have this information, consult the Locality microfiche at the LDS 
Family History Libraries. Check under both "State/Churches" and 
"State/County/Churches."

Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is barking back at Delta Air Lines for removing her from 
a jetliner because she refused to keep her two dogs in their cages. The actress 
has filed a $10-million suit against the airline alleging that she "was not 
treated in a first-class manner" by the "servants and employees" of Delta. 
"They started it," Gabor attorney Bernard Cohen said of Delta. "She's not going 
to retreat. She's on the offensive." Gabor's attorneys filed suit in Palm Beach 
County, Fla., where the actress lives. Gabor, 69, was escorted off a Delta 
plane at the Atlanta airport Jan. 6 when she insisted that her two Shih Tzu 
dogs should be allowed to ride in the passenger compartment instead of in their 
cages. When Delta employees repeatedly asked the actress to put the dogs in 
their carriers, the airline said she "insulted the Atlanta agents with 
vulgarities" and used words that were "less than ladylike." Police officers 
were called onto the airliner to escort Gabor and her two pets off the plane. 
Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate said the airline found the suit "quite 
interesting but totally unwarranted." The suit also accuses Delta spokesman 
William Berry of defaming Gabor when he described the incident to the news 
media.

Ronald Reagan leaves Washington today, but images of the retiring President by 
nearly 40 artists, including Andy Warhol and Red Grooms, continue on display in 
a new exhibit titled "Reagan: American Icon" at Bucknell University's Center 
Gallery in Pennsylvania. The Reagan interpretations feature works done in the 
past eight years and range from flattering to critical. "It's unprecedented 
that a President has had contemporary artists do this many images of him," said 
Robert P. Metzger, the gallery's director. The show includes two Warhol 
screenprints of Reagan in Van Heusen shirt advertisements published during the 
President's acting days, and a mock wooden toy by Red Grooms showing Reagan and 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev standing on a missile connected to four 
wagon wheels titled "Nuclear Nuts." ALEENE MacMINN

Leonard Slatkin, whose contract as music director and conductor of the St. 
Louis Symphony Orchestra was scheduled to end in 1991, will stay with the 
symphony for an additional two years through the 1992-93 season, it was 
announced Thursday. Slatkin, born and reared in Los Angeles, became assistant 
conductor of the symphony in 1968 and assumed his current post in 1979. Slatkin 
and the St. Louis Symphony have signed exclusive, five-year, multi-disc 
recording contracts with BMG Classics, the international recording company that

GOOD CLASHES WITH EVIL UNDER THE PUNISHING 'SUN OF SATAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True grace is to forget. . . . The supreme grace would be to love ourselves. . 
. . Human agony is beyond all an act of love." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Georges Bernanos 
</P>
<P>
In "Under the Sun of Satan" (opening today for one week at the Nuart), Maurice 
Pialat plunges us into a slate-gray world where good and evil, love and hate 
war implacably under a punishing sky. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the film is the novel by Georges Bernanos, whose books also 
inspired Robert Bresson's classic films "Diary of a Country Priest" and 
"Mouchette," and it's a story which Pialat, an unbeliever, has adapted with 
unusual devotion. He keeps the shiveringly pure line of the plot, strips the 
dialogues to a hard, blanched core. 
</P>
<P>
An ominous hush breathes over his landscape, with its steep hills, icy plains, 
tangled forests. The boundaries between the two contending forces become misty, 
confusing. The devil adopts the guise of a smiling Good Samaritan, plants a 
cold kiss on the hero's lips. God seems distant, remote. The hapless people 
buffeted between them remind us of the mad howl of Shakespeare's Lear: "As 
flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport." 
</P>
<P>
The action, set in provincial France around the 1920s, revolves around two 
characters who, presumably, embody the extremes of good and evil. Father 
Donissan (Gerard Depardieu) is a young priest who mortifies his flesh in his 
quest for godliness -- whipping himself, wearing a hair shirt. Mouchette 
(Sandrine Bonnaire) is a wanton teen-ager who becomes pregnant, accidentally 
kills one rich lover, confesses her crime to another and is plunged into the 
abyss after a chance confrontation with the suddenly all-knowing Donissan. 
</P>
<P>
It is Bernanos' and Pialat's point that the priest and murderess are not 
opposites, but spiritually akin: that Donissan, by revealing Mouchette, may be 
succumbing not to God's will, but Satan's. Donissan's quest for absolute purity 
is, in its way, as terrifying as Mouchette's reckless pursuit of desire. Both 
priest and girl search for something beyond the visible, mundane surface, and 
Satan loves Donissan, his mortal enemy, just as God loves the wayward, luckless 
Mouchette. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu and Bonnaire have done some of their best work for Pialat, and both 
achieve here, as before, an almost animalistic spontaneity, a holy on-screen 
savagery. But the crescendoes are all Bonnaire's. Depardieu becomes like a wild 
animal trainer lashing the beast within his own bosom. Shambling, lurching 
painfully through sacristy, forest or farmyard, Donissan is a saint, clumsily 
tying himself to the stake. 
</P>
<P>
Pialat has cast himself as a kind of mediator, Donissan's superior, the urbane 
Father Menou-Segrais, who knows his own carnality, sees the follies of both 
saintliness and sin. Good and evil are ultimately not incarnated in individual 
characters here but in the forces that gather around them, and the synthesis is 
aesthetic as well as moral. 
</P>
<P>
Pialat has always had a style -- restless, propulsive, fixated on the 
spontaneous truth of a scene -- which suggests, more than any of his French 
colleagues, John Cassavetes. And two opposing cinematic streams seem to be 
merging here: on one hand, the rigor and crystalline grace of Bresson, who 
wants his actors never to express any visible emotion; on the other, the 
emotional explosiveness of Cassavetes, who wants his actors to prod, probe and 
tear themselves open. They coexist, eerily, in a tremulous balance. Once again, 
spirit and flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Good and evil are subjects so vulgarized and cheapened by hordes of 
opportunistic, empty, un-moral movies that it may be hard for audiences to 
focus on them. For some, "Sun," which was booed by the crowed when it won the 
Cannes Film Festival grand prize in 1987, will be a movie of punishing 
ambition, hammering severity. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Pialat and his two great actors, Depardieu and Bonnaire, make good on 
their ambition. They give mystery and power to a story of spiritual struggle. 
If the opening of "Sun" (Times-rated Mature for adult themes), in a succession 
of grisly interiors, casts an oppressive pall, the film begins to surge with 
emotion when Pialat moves Donissan to the hillsides, beneath the cold sky and 
under Satan's dark and sinister sun. 
</P>
<P>
And it keeps moving inexorably to a splendid climax. That emotion is the 
blackened current that drives on to the end, toward death or grace, redemption 
or damnation, the occasional darkness of good, and evil's bright illusions.

'DISCARNATES' TAPS COMMON DESIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Discarnates" (Little Tokyo Cinema 1) connects with our deepest longings in 
a remarkably potent fashion. Who, after all, has not yearned for a reunion with 
long-gone loved ones? The challenge, of course, is to make such an encounter 
convincing and to give it some larger purpose. Director Nobuhiko Obayashi 
accomplishes this and more in his graceful, mysterious heart-tugging fantasy of 
the supernatural, which Shinichi Ichikawa adapted from Taichi Yamada's novel. 
</P>
<P>
Harada (Morio Kazama) is a dapper, successful, 40-year-old writer of TV soap 
operas. He lives alone in a handsome, sleekly modern flat in a building in 
which all but one of the other apartments have been converted to offices. 
</P>
<P>
One night Kei (Yuko Natori), a beautiful but distraught young woman -- and his 
sole neighbor -- knocks on his door and introduces herself, seeking company and 
clutching a bottle of champagne. Harada, tired from a long day, dismisses her 
but subsequently succumbs to her charms. On another night Harada boards a 
subway, on a seemingly abandoned line, and ends up in Asakusa, Tokyo's ancient 
and colorful amusement and shopping district, where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
In an old vaudeville theater he encounters his father (Tsurutaro Kataoka), who 
takes him home, where his mother (Kumiko Akiyoshi) insists he stay for dinner. 
The only catch is that Harada's parents were killed in an accident when he was 
only 12. 
</P>
<P>
Obayashi makes shrewd use of settings and of a particularly haunting theme from 
"Madame Butterfly." Harada's childhood home is as idealized as his parents are, 
as it is as warm as his apartment is cold in its shades of gray. His young 
parents are a humble, carefree couple devoted to each other and to their only 
son. They see him as he was as a child and are proud of his success as an 
adult, and do not see him as the middle-age man he has become, a self-absorbed, 
competitive striver who has discarded his wife and neglected his own son. At 
heart, "The Discarnates," which takes its title from an archaic word meaning 
"stripped of flesh," is a cautionary tale with which many can easily identify. 
</P>
<P>
So firm is Obayashi's control that he can get away with both the sentimental 
and the bizarre. Harada is splendid as a man transformed by experiences as 
mind-boggling as those James Stewart underwent in "It's a Wonderful Life." The 
rest of the cast is equally satisfying. You may well come away from "The 
Discarnates" (Times-rated Mature for some sex and for some sequences too 
intense for youngsters) surprised by the intensity of its emotional impact.

THE BIG SOUNDS OF GORDON GOODWIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be that the kindest thing one can do for Gordon Goodwin is to refrain 
from calling his energetic gang of players a big band. Given the negative 
commercial stigma attached to those words, it's probably better to just say 
that the 10-piece ensemble he brought into Bon Appetit on Wednesday night 
sounded like one of the most exciting groups in town. 
</P>
<P>
The truth, however, is that Goodwin's compositions and players did exactly what 
big band music once did, but hasn't much done lately: synthesized the many 
currents of music taking place at any given time into a collective expression 
that is topical, entertaining and creative. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every piece Goodwin's band performed in the evening's late set was 
filled with a lively spirit, bright and airy ensemble voicings, and solid 
soloing. Opening with a crisply rhythmic "Over And Over, Again And Again," 
Goodwin quickly shifted into the samba rhythms of "Meet Me at the Carnival" and 
a lovingly conceived to Bill Evans titled "For Bill." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Goodwin, the leader's wife, was featured on a set of three numbers, 
singing with a lovely dark-toned timbre and a strong blues phrasing -- most 
notably so on "Since I Fell For You" and a Goodwin &amp; Goodwin original, "I 
Had a Dream We Said Goodby Last Night." 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin's innate sense of whimsy, one of his many appealing qualities, 
dominated "Down the Middle to Worthy," a tribute to the L.A. Laker forward 
which was written, predictably and humorously, on the chord changes of "Sweet 
Georgia Brown." A tribute to a different kind of sporting character, "Surf 
Dude," was almost as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every member of the band soloed on one piece or another. Among the 
most outstanding examples were Clay Jenkins' eccentric, Swing-inspired trumpet 
improvisations, Dan Higgins' hot alto saxophone lines, and Goodwin's 
blues-based tenor solos. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening's real star was Goodwin's belief that large instrumental 
ensemble music (for lack of a less problematic label) is still alive and 
kicking. Call it by whatever name you like, Gordon Goodwin's band and the music 
he writes for it are something very special, indeed. DON HECKMAN

A GENTLE PISANO AND STOCKWELL GET A JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Wednesday night's temblor provided a pretty good jolt to the small Comeback 
Inn in Venice -- though it left no visible damage -- it was amazing that 
guitarists John Pisano and John Stockwell could even continue to play, let 
alone complete the interrupted song "Cascades" with invention and musicality. 
But those qualities were in abundance during the lengthy one-set performance 
that revealed two artists with very diverse perspectives often coming together 
as one. 
</P>
<P>
Pisano, who has deep be-bop roots, used a classic and open bodied jazz guitar, 
getting a dark, steely sound on the latter. Stowell, an Oregonian with a flair 
for impressionistic forays, used a solid-body electric model that, by employing 
a synthesizer, at times sounded like an electric piano and a steam calliope as 
well as a ringing-toned guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Standards like "Stella by Starlight" and "You and the Night and the Music," 
along with Brazilian items such as "O Grande Amor" and "Picture in Black and 
White," with Stowell playing the melody, followed by solos, made up the 
program. Pisano's firm rhythmic sense and keen melodic conception served as 
contrast to Stowell's proclivity for fanciful flight, but on "You and the 
Night" and "One Night Samba" both men played more as one than two. 
</P>
<P>
Though the accompaniment of a bass player and drummer was occasionally missed, 
the mostly gentle sounds the men offered reminded us what quiet music can do -- 
relax the mind, and ease the commotion that makes up so much of our daily life.

MEAT PUPPETS AIM FOR THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In front of a Roxy crowd conspicuous for the number of major-label talent 
scouts on hand Wednesday, the Meat Puppets was on its best behavior -- little 
of the indulgent spaceyness and carelessness that had plagued some past 
appearances and plenty of the glistening, compact, left-of-center rock that put 
the band at the top of the underground a couple years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing, too. After spending those couple years unable to make good on its 
major-league potential, this could be the Phoenix trio's last chance for a shot 
at the big time. Given those circumstances, you could almost hear the label 
reps ticking off the band's pluses and minuses in their heads during the first 
of two sets Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A plus for good vibes; the Puppets evoke the sunny desert mind-set as well 
as the Beach Boys do the sand 'n' surf scene. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another plus for musicianship; Curt Kirkwood is a phenomenally nimble 
guitar player, and the interplay he creates with his bassist brother Chris and 
drummer Derrick Bostrom is often complex, and yet still sloppily (in a good 
way) spontaneous. This is true throughout the band's range, from shimmering 
ditties to head-banging crunchers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One more plus for intangibles; there's a certain endearing quality to these 
three long-haired ragamuffins. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A minus for singing; Curt Kirkwood doesn't just strain for the high notes, 
he strains for every note. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A minus for depth; the most prominent -- and sometimes sole -- emotion 
evident in the Puppets' songs is whimsy, though some new material at least felt 
(words were hard to pick out) like the band was exploring new territories. 
</P>
<P>
Added up, the Meat Puppets landed in the plus column Wednesday, a band that 
still deserves a shot at the majors. STEVE HOCHMAN

ROBERT FRIPP AND HIS CRAFTY LEAGUE AT BOGART'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last four years, Robert Fripp, the innovative guitarist noted for his 
work with King Crimson, collaborations with Brian Eno and his own brand of 
"Frippertonics," has been conducting seminars and offering courses under the 
auspices of the West Virginia-based Guitar Craft Services. According to Fripp, 
more than 600 guitarists have taken these courses, many of them playing at one 
time or another in his performance group billed as "the League of Crafty 
Guitarists." 
</P>
<P>
There might have been only 14 musicians in the version of the League that 
played at Bogart's on Wednesday night, but, together with Fripp, they made up 
for the other 586. With all musicians maintaining Fripp's passively alert 
decorum, the League produced a stimulating, often startling array of voicings. 
With several guitarists doubling parts, playing tangent harmonies or utilizing 
rhythmic delays, the group had an orchestral timbre, its bass lines sometimes 
resembling the stops of a great cathedral organ. 
</P>
<P>
Fripp's music is rooted in European modernism: The compositions generally 
bypassed the more familiar guitar formulas (blues/country/rock), producing a 
cerebral collage of repetitious minor and augmented runs. At times it had the 
feel of harried insects working in a state of advanced anxiety, while other 
pieces had the lyrical lilt of complicated Irish jigs. One imagines that if the 
rhythms were written out, they'd resemble a sexy form of algebra. 
</P>
<P>
Fripp and company's splendid display of interval hopscotch was techniquely 
remarkable, sonically diverting and often just plain beautiful. The League's 
Southern California swing was set to continue with shows Thursday at the Coach 
House in San Juan Capistrano, tonight at the Japan America Cultural Center in 
Los Angeles and Saturday at the Bacchanal in San Diego. CRAIG LEE

New York sculptor Joel Shapiro forges a curious blend of Minimalism and 
geometric abstraction in a series of new pastel drawings. Staunchly traditional 
modernist work that poses formal questions concerning line, mass, color and 
space, the drawings -- all untitled -- offer few clues as to how Shapiro 
intends that they be interpreted, and that theoretical ambiguity is 
simultaneously chic and worrisome. It's always hip to play it close to the 
vest, yet there's something vaguely fretful about these stark compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's basic recipe involves one or more squares of intensely saturated 
color, tilted and cocked at odd angles, while floating in a smudged white 
field. Jaunty, almost recklessly self-confident, the work exudes the breezy 
good taste of a cover for the New Yorker magazine, yet one can't help 
suspecting that there's something academic and perhaps a bit pedantic afoot.

"The city never looked that good," a middle-aged man said enthusiastically the 
other day as he gazed at Larry Cohen's gently idealized paintings of Los 
Angeles. If Cohen's subjects were panoramas of Cincinnati or Passaic you can 
bet local interest would be a good deal milder. What he does, after all, is not 
terribly remarkable. It is a question of organizing familiar topography into 
views -- the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway, the visible 
area from the top of Westridge, downtown L.A. as seen from Micheltorena. To 
perform this act of local homage, as every landscape painter knows, you divide 
your canvas into horizontal zones of alternately dark and light areas and 
generalize the details. 
</P>
<P>
Things perk up a bit when a specific light effect dominates a scene. In "View 
of Bay/Pacific Palisades," the shadow that creeps inexorably across waves, the 
strip of sand, the street and the hills have the majestic effect of a 
visitation from a Supreme Being. But for the most part, these paintings seem 
little different in spirit from those turned out generations ago by the first 
sun-struck visitors to our shores. 
</P>
<P>
If Cohen is obliged by modern-day realities to include signs of the 
congestedness of urban life, he doesn't seem to have an opinion about it. Nor 
does he (like Wayne Thiebaud in San Francisco) invent new ways of painting the 
same old sights. Attractive, familiar, unthreatening, his paintings don't 
recreate Los Angeles; they just copy it according to time-tested formulas. It's 
too late in the day to be satisfied with that. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 
Melrose Ave., to Feb. 4.) CATHY CURTIS

If you agree with the notion behind an exhibition called "Art as Religion," 
that art is a way for individuals to contact something greater than themselves, 
you may come to this group show expecting some kind of revelation. If so, 
you'll be disappointed. There are no revelations here. But it's the concept not 
the art that's at fault. Theme shows tend to use art to illustrate a point only 
peripherally related to the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
There are solid and evocative pieces in this show, but the context makes the 
them come off like pseudo relics from a quasi religious art community. There is 
the monkish asceticism of Lance Letscher's lead covered "Table, Bowl And Spoon" 
and the contemporary ritualized garments of Craig Roper's midwestern polyester 
leisure suit. Burial crypts that taunt death are suggested by Yolande McKay's 
sealed cement boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Petibon tackles all the theological-cum-art-world conundrums in his 
amusing installation. Cameron Shaw turns a bottled inner tube into a venerated 
assemblage relic. Liz Young's macabre humor deals with the sordid side of 
religion, pushing penance into physical torture. David French debunks the 
sacredness of the all hallowed object with a rip-off and a price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The show at least puts us in touch with newcomer Lori Precious' untitled 
bottled baby series and her long steel bird house with its icon altar of bird 
wings. As venerations of the fragile side of life, her aesthetic is as 
sensitive as Annette Lemieux's museum love story is refreshing.

Have you ever wondered what kinds of lighting the experts use in their homes? 
Are you entirely clear about the distinctions between a Watt-Miser 120-Watt 
Indoor Reflector Flood and a 3-Way Soft-White Reader Light? New York artist 
collaborators Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler have cooked up an installation with 
eight discs of sandblasted glass, each inscribed with the name of a man and a 
room in a house, and each illuminated by a different type of General Electric 
bulb. The men are supposedly real-life GE lighting specialists who use the 
designated bulbs in one of the rooms of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Ericson and Ziegler make a practice of working with non-art materials and 
finding unexpected sorts of things to analyze and pigeonhole. Their work 
contains both a subversive intellectuality and a sly visual appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Each bulb casts a distinctive pattern of light (a "distinctiveness" that is 
really mass-produced, of course). Because the piece hangs in the gallery, the 
viewer is likely to begin to analyze each bulb's light-emitting quality only to 
realize that the aesthetic quality of the light is really bound up with the 
utility of the object. (If you're buying a bulb for your bedroom, you're likely 
to choose it because of the kind of light it throws.) 
</P>
<P>
So here you are, holding the concept of "bedroom" or "kitchen" or "closet" in 
your mind while trying to match it with the kinds of light thrown by various 
bulbs. You're performing the same kind of mental gymnastics you're apt to do in 
front of a conceptual piece of art (which this is) and simultaneously realizing 
this is what you do in a utilitarian, daily-life context. Clever stuff, and 
rather delicious at that. (Burnett Miller Gallery, 964 N. La Brea Ave., to Feb.

****"The International Tournee of Animation, Volume I: The 19th Tournee." 
Expanded Entertainment, $39. 
</P>
<P>
This collection of 14 excellent shorts from nine countries showcases the 
diversity of world animation. Dujan Petricic's outrageous re-telling of "Romeo 
and Juliet" (Yugoslavia) with monsters, and "Charade" (Canada), John Minnis' 
Oscar-winning parody of parlor games, recapture the hilarity of the classic 
Hollywood cartoons. A second Academy Award-winner, Borge Ring's "Anna and 
Bella" (Holland), in which two aged sisters reminisce about their shared lives, 
shows how a talented artist can capture the most deeply felt emotions in a few 
simple lines. An exceptional package of films. Information: (213) 473-6701.

NOSTALGIA, GUMBO SET VILLAGE APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN

<TEXT>
<P>
When I walked into the Village Bar-B-Que, a man at the register greeted me 
warmly and grabbed a menu. "One for dinner?" he said. "Or are you meeting 
someone?" 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be three," I said and peered down the row of pine booths to see if my 
friends had arrived. Just as I spotted them in the last booth, they called my 
name. "There they are," I pointed. "Here I am," I called back to them. "Hey! 
Hi! I can't believe you beat me here!" I suddenly realized I was just hollering 
these happy greetings the length of the restaurant. Such noisomeness is not 
particularly like me. But I wasn't to blame. There are so many pigs -- plastic 
pigs, wooden pigs, pig signs, pig memorabilia, pig paintings -- adorning the 
Village Bar-B-Que's walls, it pulled the hog caller right outta me. "Hey 
Richard," I sang, "Hey Joooo-leee!" 
</P>
<P>
"We like this place already," Julie said as I sat down. "Especially that play 
car." She pointed to a yellow, kid-size roadster in a row of toy tractors, tin 
trucks and an antique miniature steamroller: the Village Bar-B-Que is as much a 
private toy and nostalgia museum as a restaurant. Warm, cozily dim lighting 
comes from hanging, glass-shaded, converted gaslights from 1917. Tin signs 
advertise Kayo soft drinks, Chesterfields and Old Gold Cigarettes -- "not a 
cough in a carload." Flowers hang in old Roseville pottery wall vases. We 
looked and looked and kept forgetting to look at our menus. Our waitress, 
obviously used to such distraction, cheerfully forgave our inattention. "You 
think this is a lot of stuff?" She sniffed. "Wait'll we get that back room 
remodeled and the owner fills it up." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, we turned our attention to our menus, which were divided between 
special Creole entrees, barbecue and sandwiches, and Julie asked a question 
nobody could answer: "Are spareribs like extra ribs? . . . Like some auxiliary 
set on a pig?" 
</P>
<P>
We started with a hot-link appetizer; good, garlicky sausage rounds served with 
toothpicks; and a "Creole" gumbo, which I thought was some of the tastiest, 
most authentic -- and reasonably priced gumbo -- I've had in these parts. The 
sausage was spicy, the chicken cooked to shreds, the sauce rich and murky and 
thick and there was file powder served on the side so that we could thicken it 
even more. Then Julie tried to stump us again with another question. "What is 
file anyway? Is there a file plant?" 
</P>
<P>
Luckily -- or not -- I had recently done some research on the subject, so I 
gave a little speech about how file is a powder made from dried wild sassafras 
leaves. Sassafras leaves are used as a flavoring agent, an aromatic stimulant, 
a diuretic and a diaphoretic (sweat-producing agent); also, they're helpful for 
skin eruptions, rheumatism, gout and arthritis. My 1979 edition of "Joy of 
Cooking," however, says that file powder has been banned by the Food and Drug 
Administration as carcinogenic and suggests that "to reproduce its mucilaginous 
texture, use tapioca flour." 
</P>
<P>
After the dinner, I called George Bigner, technical director at Zatarain Foods 
in Louisiana, to clarify this last point. "It's true that the FDA banned the 
root and woody portions of the sassafrass plant, because they have been able to 
isolate safrole, a known carcinogen, in those parts. But they have not been 
able to isolate it in the leafy portion. We have been in close contact with 
both the FDA and USDA about file's possible carcinogenic properties, and I have 
to say I really don't think there's a problem," George said. "In fact, the 
source of all the concern has come from that paragraph in 'The Joy of Cooking.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
During the meal, I tell my friends, "Back in the early '70s, some hippies I 
knew in North Carolina used to take sassafras as a psychedelic." 
</P>
<P>
Julie was wide-eyed. When our friendly, wonderfully good-natured waitress 
reappeared, Julie said, "Did you know that file powder is a psychedelic 
carcinogen?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is," the waitress said, "but people sure go crazy for our 
gumbo." 
</P>
<P>
Along with our gumbo, we tried some hush puppies, which were too heavy and 
dense and dry and not crunchy enough but probably would've been just fine for 
their original (namesake) function. 
</P>
<P>
For dinner, Richard tried the shrimp Creole, spicy rice covered with a pretty 
good Creole sauce. "It's good, but I think the shrimp aren't very tasty," he 
said. Julie and I both had barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
A statement on the front of the menu had warned us that the barbecue is served 
with sauce on the side. "Since we start with ribs of the highest quality, lean 
and meaty, and barbecue them slowly and patiently for hours in hickory-wood 
smoke . . . we feel you should have the opportunity to taste the delectable 
product undisguised." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Julie's chicken and ribs came from the kitchen looking like, 
well, plain old meat -- the spareribs, especially, which I'm accustomed to 
seeing all drippy with sauce, were oddly unappealing, not even toasty brown 
but, well, the color of boiled pork -- although they're obviously not boiled. 
Sauce came on the side in little paper souffle cups and, although both the hot 
and mild sauces were delicious, they didn't disguise the fact that the 
spareribs and the white meat of the chicken were dry. 
</P>
<P>
I'd ordered the Texas-style ribs -- hot. The thick beef ribs, although smoky 
and tasty, were also dry, but I liked the way they were cunningly hot. And my 
sauce didn't come on the side -- the cook had dipped my ribs back in the 
kitchen, and done so before cooking them too. It took awhile for the hot sauce 
to kick in, but then we were all snuffling merrily into our I--RIBS bibs. 
</P>
<P>
"What this place needs is antique tissue-holders on each table," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we got Wet Naps for our hands and then dessert. The sweet potato pie 
wasn't sweet, which I liked but Richard didn't. "It tastes like a vegetable 
rather than a pastry," he said. The peach pie was classically good, but the 
bread pudding, served with an intoxicating, rum-rich hard sauce, was downright 
heady. 
</P>
<P>
After we were done eating, we lingered for an hour more, chatting and enjoying 
the memorabilia. I may have wished that the food were more inspired, but the 
amusing atmosphere and the good-natured staff couldn't have made us feel more 
relaxed. I mean, how uptight could we be sitting in a room full of toys and 
looking at a pig-shaped sign advertising Big Red's Pig Farm?

LITTLE BIT OF NASHVILLE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
RHYTHM RIDERS REMIND AUDIENCES OF THEIR ROOTS IN THE SOUTH, MIDWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

First things first. This ain't the Grand Ole Opry and we're not listening to 
Loretta Lynn or Randy Travis. Or Buck Owens or Hank Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
We're not in Nashville. We're in the Little Nashville, the country and Western 
club in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Who would know the difference? Certainly not the Rhythm Riders, the house band, 
which for the last decade has tried to transport audiences back to their 
Midwestern and Southern roots. Every Wednesday through Sunday night, the group 
charms audiences with both original compositions and familiar country tunes 
like Randy Travis' "All My Ex's Live in Texas," and Patsy Cline's "I Fall to 
Pieces." The band's repertoire includes Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley songs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the audience comes here for acid rock, they can forget it," laughed Johnnie 
White, 63, lead singer/steel guitar player/club owner. "There are a lot of 
country fans in the Valley. Many were born in the Midwest and moved out here. 
And if they like to dance, we've got the beat for them." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday night, most of the audience -- a typical weekend night 
crowd is 200 -- took his advice. The dance floor was packed with couples who 
were alternating between slow embraces and faster two-steps. Lead guitarist 
Calvin Davidson said that flexibility is why the band feels so comfortable at 
the Little Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played other clubs that cater to the two-step and the 10-step dance 
crowd and you have to play the current hit material," Davidson said. "Here it's 
more relaxed. You can play original rock 'n' roll too." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Little Nashville patrons eschew the dance floor and opt for pool, 
darts or conversation in the dark, smoky club. Or they order a meal from the 
steak-and-potatoes menu. 
</P>
<P>
White first started the Rhythm Riders in 1946 in Memphis. But his show business 
career has included stints as a nightclub singer in Chicago and Detroit and as 
a radio and television host in Iowa and South Dakota. On one half-hour country 
and western variety television show, White said, he sang, introduced other 
performers and showed one-hour Western movies in 15-minute segments. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the time to do the whole thing in one day," he said, so the 
15-minute movie portions would air on four successive days. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, White learned that another group had copyrighted the Rhythm 
Riders' name, so he renamed the band "Johnnie White and the Sons of the West." 
He kept that name until last year, when he heard radio station KCSN play one of 
his old songs that had been recorded by the original group. White decided then 
to return to the Rhythm Riders' name. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, after six years nonstop on the road in the Midwest White figured that 
it was time to settle down. His daughter had moved to California and he wanted 
to be near her. So he bought a club. 
</P>
<P>
He changed its name from Dubby's to the Little Nashville. He brought his band 
with him, although none of those members are part of the current lineup. 
(Besides White and Davidson, the band includes John Stevenson on bass guitar, 
Roy Perkey on fiddle and Nicky Ortiz on drums). Only White remains from the 
original group. 
</P>
<P>
For a lot of fans, White said, that's enough. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people come in here and ask whether that could possibly be the same 
Johnnie White from South Dakota and Iowa," White said. "They remember me from 
the road. It's like reliving the old days." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for Perkey as well. At 64, he's been playing fiddle for a 
half-century. "This is all I do and I love it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other band members do studio work and have played in other groups. The 
quintet only rehearse when they have to learn a new song. White does the 
majority of the singing, blending his soothing voice with the band's lively 
guitar arrangements. Occasionally guest vocalists will join in. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the lineup, White tries to stick to one main objective. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a song like it was recorded, with the right tempo and sound," White 
said. "It sounds like Buck Owens or Randy Travis. We don't mess up or deviate. 
The younger generation will take one of the standard tunes and when they get 
through, it's unrecognizable. The true country fans want to hear it like it was 
originally recorded." 
</P>
<P>
Like it was sung at the Grand Ole Opry. 
</P>
<P>
Like they're really in Nashville.

WHEN YEARS, NOT DOLLARS, COUNT FOR SUCCESS IN THE THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE DOOR IN AGOURA SURVIVES BY PRESENTING MAINSTREAM FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

How do you measure the success of an Equity waiver theater? According to Gale 
Trumbeaux, the executive producer of the Stage Door Theatre in Agoura, 
longevity -- rather than profitability -- is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eight years we've been in operation, many little theaters in Los 
Angeles and the Valley have closed their doors," said Trumbeaux, 50. But the 
49-seat Stage Door continues to survive by offering mainstream fare, such as 
Neil Simon and Agatha Christie. "Wait Until Dark" and "Deathtrap," and Simon's 
"Chapter Two" and "Same Time Next Year" have been among its most successful 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has been closed for minor repairs since mid-December, but Trumbeaux 
plans to reopen the Stage Door tomorrow with Noel Coward's "Private Lives," in 
which she will star. 
</P>
<P>
Trumbeaux's introduction to show business came at age 17 with her marriage to 
Fred Astaire II. "I spent 7 years living in the Fred Astaire household" in 
Beverly Hills, she said, "and I absorbed a strong feeling for show business 
through my surroundings." She added, "We had an elegant life, including 
servants and travel and lots of visiting royalty -- both the real and the 
Hollywood variety." 
</P>
<P>
When the marriage ended, Trumbeaux found herself a "Cinderella in reverse." "I 
didn't get a penny in alimony or child support," she said, "although I do have 
some wonderful furnishings and silverware which the Astaires were kind enough 
to give me." 
</P>
<P>
When a second marriage ended, Trumbeaux moved with her two sons -- one from 
each marriage -- from Northridge to Agoura Hills. Although she had no business 
or theater experience, Trumbeaux persuaded a friend who was an actor to open 
the Firelite Dinner Theater in Ventura. From 1969 to 1979, Trumbeaux drove from 
her home in Agoura to Ventura, gaining experience in acting and directing. 
Finally, tired of the drive, she decided to look for something closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
"For years I had been aware of an old building located at the corner of Agoura 
Road and Lewis Street," Trumbeaux said. "It was a momma-papa market and gas 
station at one time but had been vacant for years. The owner thought I was 
crazy to try to put a theater in there, so I had to act a lot more confident 
about it than I felt." 
</P>
<P>
Trumbeaux rented the space, borrowed $5,000 from her parents and transformed 
the 1920s-era general store into a small theater with a 9-by-13 foot stage. She 
purchased seats from the Shrine Auditorium for $5 apiece and, in November, 
1980, opened with Simon's "Plaza Suite." 
</P>
<P>
No one associated with the theater is paid, but Trumbeaux has a file of actors, 
directors and technicians who are available to help her meet her goal of 
mounting a production every 6 to 8 weeks. Occasionally she tries to branch out 
and stage some not-so-traditional productions. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to mount some Tennessee Williams plays a few years ago and they 
bombed," she said. But "I'm going to try 'Death of a Salesman' as a favor to an 
actor friend in March. I can afford to take a chance like that every few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Shelley, the "actor friend" who will play Willie Loman in the Arthur 
Miller play, is a 28-year veteran of theater and television. He recently 
completed a television pilot (with Howie Mandel) titled "Past Imperfect," 
played a police sergeant in the TV series "Crazy Like a Fox" and a teacher in 
the syndicated series "Fame." He played Loman several years ago in an 
off-Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the Stage Door Theatre is like a gym," said Shelley, who has acted in 
and directed many of the local productions. "It helps me keep my acting muscles 
in shape." 
</P>
<P>
After many years of commuting to Los Angeles, Karen Machon, an actress with a 
2-year-old son who lives in Agoura Hills, became a part of the Stage Door 
Theatre's "repertory group" to "keep my skills honed." She, too, has appeared 
regularly in series television -- she starred with Dennis Weaver in "Stone" and 
made guest appearances on such TV dramas as "Police Story" and "Columbo." 
</P>
<P>
"Gale has virtually no ego," Machon said. "Unlike others in this business, she 
provides an ideal atmosphere for actors to flourish creatively." 
</P>
<P>
"Gale's no prima donna," said Marc Alaimo, a television and movie actor who 
recently appeared in "Educating Rita" at the Stage Door. "She vacuums, cleans 
the bathrooms and books the cast and crew of every play. She also begs, borrows 
or steals the props and scenery." 
</P>
<P>
The Stage Door is also a place where relatively inexperienced actors and 
directors can gain experience. Julie Silver, a 27-year-old graduate of UCLA's 
Theater Arts Department, works full time as a draftsman and will direct the 
Stage Door's production of "Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary, but I'm doing my research. I've worked with Gale and Dave Shelley 
before so I'm looking forward to the chance," Silver said. And, she added, she 
enjoys working without the pressures imposed by a professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
Trumbeaux says she "ekes out a living" through her work at the Stage Door. "I 
pay the rent -- for both the theater and my home -- and put food on the table" 
from the proceeds at the box office. "But I live very simply," she added. "I've 
owned my house for more than 20 years so my payments are small. I don't have 
any charge accounts. I have no medical or life insurance. It's not a life style 
most people would want, but it suits me because I'm doing what I want to do."

A convicted robber who had escaped from the California Men's Colony in San Luis 
Obispo eight years ago turned himself in because he wants to "start fresh," 
prison officials said. The fugitive, Dennis L. Wedge, 31, had escaped in 1981 
after serving one year of a six-year sentence for a robbery committed in San 
Bernardino, Associate Warden Gail Lewis said. After showing up at the Central 
California prison, he told officials he has "led a crime-free life" in another 
state since his escape and wants "to clear things up and start fresh," Lewis 
said. She said Wedge would be charged with escape.

The nation's mayors, declaring their readiness to cooperate with the Bush 
Administration, urged the incoming President to add $10.7 billion to President 
Reagan's budget for urban aid. "The last Reagan budget recommended additional 
cuts in urban programs which, over the last 10 years, have shouldered an 
overwhelming burden in the battle to reduce the deficit," the mayors said in a 
statement issued at the close of their annual winter meeting in Washington. The 
mayors said that during Reagan's eight years in office, the cumulative budget 
for key urban programs was cut by nearly 82%. Mayor Arthur J. Holland of 
Trenton, N.J., president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said a delegation of 
mayors met with Bush a few weeks ago and left with the impression that "the 
President-elect was sensitive to our needs and would do everything he could to 
help meet those needs."

Attorneys for accused child killer Joel Steinberg concluded their case by 
blaming his lover for the death of the child they raised, claiming Hedda 
Nussbaum killed the little girl in a jealous rage. Steinberg's lawyers steered 
clear of a possible last-minute insanity defense -- despite indications they 
might use one -- and instead revealed to the jury for the first time in the 
12-week murder trial what their client maintains happened the night Lisa 
Steinberg, the 6-year-old girl he and Nussbaum raised but never adopted, was 
battered into a fatal coma. "Hedda caused the injury to Lisa. She did it 
herself in a fight," attorney Ira London said during the five-hour defense 
summation in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Yugoslavia named Ante Markovic, 64, a liberal reformer from Croatia, as new 
premier in a move to try to pull the country out of its economic crisis. 
Analysts saw Markovic's appointment by the collective state presidency as 
evidence that a political compromise might have between struck between Serbia 
and Croatia, the country's two largest republics. It also signaled that 
Yugoslavia might move more firmly toward economic reforms that party 
conservatives resisted last year as the country plunged into its worst 
political and economic chaos since World War II. Markovic, whose appointment 
must be approved by Parliament, will succeed Branko Mikulic, whose government 
resigned Dec. 30.

SOVIET CRIME RATE UP 17% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet crime rate rose nearly 17% last year as President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's reform programs unwittingly contributed to a rash of assaults, 
robberies and thefts, according to an interview in the Communist Party 
newspaper Pravda. Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin noted that attacks on 
police increased and street crime rose by more than 40%. He said that 
Gorbachev's reforms, while making Soviet society more open, created 
"complicated, at times painful processes of self-cleansing, an increase in 
civil and ethnic self-awareness." He cited Latvia and Estonia as specific 
examples of the latter and added that many criminals released from labor camps 
under legal reforms have been unable to find work because state industries are 
cutting back and some have returned to crime.

Surrealist painter Salvador Dali's condition worsened after he developed 
pneumonia and an inflamed lung, according to the hospital in Figueras, Spain, 
where he is being treated. Dali, 84, suffers from heart problems for which he 
has been hospitalized three times in the last two months. His personal 
physician, Dr. Carlos Ponsati, said that he is in critical condition with a 
high fever and that X-rays showed he was getting worse by the hour. Doctors 
have ruled out moving him to a larger institution in Barcelona, about 60 miles 
from Figueras, because of his fragile condition, Spanish news reports said.

Fifteen years after Congress enacted a law to protect endangered species, most 
of the nearly 500 types of animals and plants show no signs of recovery and 
many continue their slide toward extinction, a congressional study said. The 
General Accounting Office criticized a practice by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service of concentrating on high-profile species, such as the bald eagle and 
Aleutian Canada goose, over species on the verge of extinction. "Instead of 
giving priority to the most endangered species and to those actions needed to 
prevent extinctions in the foreseeable future, as required by its guidelines, 
FWS instead is concentrating recovery funds on species with high 'public 
appeal' and those approaching recovery," the GAO wrote. "FWS officials told GAO 
that the desire for a positive public view of the program . . . is motivating 
its actions." Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), who requested the study by the 
congressional watchdog agency, said the GAO's conclusions "reinforce my own 
view that a more serious and professional approach to protecting endangered 
species is required if the goals of federal law are to be met."

The five presidents of Central America apparently have agreed to hold a 
long-delayed regional peace summit Feb. 8-9 in El Salvador, Nicaraguan 
officials said. A senior Foreign Ministry official said the summit, postponed 
four times since last August, "is almost a sure thing". A government statement 
said Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega telephoned the leaders of Guatemala and 
Costa Rica to confirm the dates. President Oscar Arnulfo Arias of Costa Rica, 
who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his regional peace plan, had asked that 
a meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 be postponed until President-elect Bush takes 
office today.

TIMING IS THE KEY IN QUAKE CALCULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
For seismologist Lucille Jones, Wednesday night's 5.0 magnitude earthquake 
happened at exactly the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Caltech's sophisticated new computer had gone on the blink, 
making it impossible to get instant readings of earthquake magnitudes and 
locations. Also, the seismologist in charge of the regional earthquake 
monitoring network -- a woman who is reluctant to take vacations for fear of 
missing an earthquake -- had just left for Hawaii . . . on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
And Jones, who had been trying since 9 o'clock to get her 2-year-old son to 
sleep, finally succeeded a little before 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
That's when a sharp jolt brought Jones scurrying to Caltech's earthquake lab, 
where she and a crew of eight or nine other scientists began the hasty task of 
determining the size and location of the quake and notifying government 
agencies that might have to handle injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
The team, representing Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey, runs a network 
of 256 earthquake reporting stations scattered from Big Sur and Mammoth Lakes 
to the California border. Several stations are located on Santa Catalina and 
other offshore islands. 
</P>
<P>
The far-flung network automatically feeds 25,000 bits of information each 
second into two banks of computers at Caltech's Pasadena campus. But any time 
the instruments detect a quake of 4.0 magnitude or greater, the scientists go 
to work. If it happens at night, an alarm sounds on campus and night-shift 
school employees put out a call -- by telephone or beeper -- to the 
seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Respond Like Firefighters 
</P>
<P>
They respond much like firefighters, racing the clock to reach their computer 
keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so critical that we'll run red lights or speed, but we'll drop 
whatever we're doing and come," said seismic analyst Steve Bryant, who lives a 
few blocks from the lab. Like many quake experts, Bryant often can tell much 
about a temblor's size and location as soon as he feels it. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby quakes produce sharp, short vibrations. Far-away quakes create slower 
motions. Many times, if he is sitting or lying very still, he can roughly 
calculate that distance and the quake's general size in his head. But not on 
Wednesday. This one caught Bryant off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the shower," he said. "They do hit us at some of the worst times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raced to Lab 
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's quake caused a few minor injuries, seismologists could 
tell immediately that the temblor was one they would need to analyze. Jones did 
not wait for a phone call. She raced to the lab in about 10 minutes, 
encountering several other staff members who had beat her there. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest arrivals confirmed the quake by looking through computer printouts 
of activity at the monitoring stations. All 256 stations picked up the quake, 
the seventh 5.0-or-greater temblor to strike Southern California since 1987. 
(Typically, about four such quakes are reported each year statewide.) 
</P>
<P>
Scientists then turned to their computer terminals and seismographs to 
undertake more detailed studies. Comparing the times when the shock waves 
arrived at various stations, they placed the epicenter south of Malibu in Santa 
Monica Bay. They looked at the amplitude of the chart readings. On many of the 
seismographs, the needles had swung off the charts. But enough data was 
available to gauge the magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Crews Informed 
</P>
<P>
The calculations took about 20 minutes, far longer than they might have with a 
new, high-powered computer that is inexplicably on the fritz, Jones said. But 
the findings were announced just in time for television news crews waiting 
outside the lab door shortly before 11:30, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant described the quake as moderate, not quite large enough to be damaging. 
Its location, believed to be on the Torrance-Wilmington fault, was several 
miles offshore, and it was relatively deep, about 7 miles down. Those two 
factors helped keep down injuries and property damage, the seismic analyst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The typical Los Angeles-area quake is about 4 miles down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said the quake was felt over a relatively large geographic area in part 
because it occurred at such a late hour of the evening. "At 11 o'clock, a lot 
of people are in bed, and they're fairly still," he said. "That helps."

OFFICER HITS THE PRIME TIME WITH VIDEO CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last 14 months, Don Carlos Jackson has kept a video camera close at 
hand as part of a campaign that has made him, possibly, the most hated cop in 
squad rooms around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Whether driving his Corvette through Marina del Rey on the way home from a date 
or sitting in a van with friends in Watts, Jackson has been ready to tape 
fellow police officers in action. 
</P>
<P>
By his own estimate, he has stopped as many as 300 times to watch police as 
they question others. And sometimes he has used himself as bait, driving 
through neighborhoods where he suspects a 30-year-old black man might draw some 
attention from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave, calls his patrols a 
"litmus test" of how Los Angeles-area law enforcement agencies treat black 
people. And in most cases, he admits, the police have passed the test -- 
officers have acted with restraint even when he pestered them to justify why 
they arrested someone or to explain what law empowered them to ask a car's 
passengers for identification. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of his "stings" were unspectacular and his tapes drew dust on 
the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
But this week Jackson hit prime time. 
</P>
<P>
With an NBC television camera capturing the action, two Long Beach police 
officers stopped him and a friend for allegedly weaving across traffic lanes. 
Audiences nationwide watched as Jackson got out of the car, hesitated before 
putting his hands over his head and argued with Officer Mark Dickey, who then, 
with a stream of obscenities, apparently pushed Jackson's face into a plate 
glass window. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tactics Debated 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI have begun 
investigations of the Saturday night incident. And Jackson's tactics have been 
debated from the opinion pages of newspapers to the Los Angeles barber shop he 
uses. Some have questioned his actions, while others have asked: Who is Don 
Jackson and what is he trying to prove? 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said in an interview that he did not welcome the violent confrontation 
that made him a celebrity, but neither was he displeased by the reverberations 
of the Long Beach officer's action. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was sitting in the back of the police car," he said, "as much pain as I 
was in, I had a slight smile on my face. I said to myself, 'This guy has done 
all the work for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in the close-knit fraternity of law enforcement, the incident only 
solidified the feeling of most that Jackson is an enemy of the officer on the 
beat. Police officials in a number of departments had already cautioned their 
troops to be on the alert for the off-duty Hawthorne sergeant. Jackson himself 
said he had heard of his photograph being used as a squad room dart board. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not one of us," one Hawthorne officer said. "He's not a cop anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Jackson is a man born into the police fraternity and one who knows 
firsthand what it feels like to have to defend yourself against brutality 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a career sheriff's deputy, his life was built on a bedrock of 
conformity and assimilation, at least until it was remade by the troubling 
issue of race. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was bused from Los Angeles' inner city to mostly white Birmingham High 
School in the San Fernando Valley during the late 1970s. There he followed the 
advice of his father, Woodrow, who retired in 1984 after 29 years with the 
Sheriff's Department, and who said he taught his son to prove himself with hard 
work, "not with free promotions or affirmative action or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Student 
</P>
<P>
Elected captain of Birmingham's wrestling and football teams, Don Jackson "was 
one of the most popular kids on campus," recalled the school's athletic 
director, Louis Ramirez. "He was a hard worker who never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson said his high school years left him with some bitter memories as 
well -- such as the racial taunts of a white student who had a neighboring 
locker. 
</P>
<P>
He portrays himself as an intense teen-ager who kept his emotions inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I was completely by myself, and that has been consistent in my life," he said. 
"You can't afford to fight all the time, so you just go about your business." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, "I always felt, it's got to stop somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from California Lutheran College, Jackson joined the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department as a deputy in the County Jail. About 1 1/2 years 
later, in 1982, he was hired by the Hawthorne Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Good Qualities 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues who would later criticize his public campaigns admitted that Jackson 
was a good officer. One superior, Capt. David Barnes, described him as an "an 
intelligent, articulate, good-looking guy." 
</P>
<P>
But like many law enforcement officers, Jackson found that the people he dealt 
with sometimes questioned the force he used. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Hawthorne was sued in 1982 by a man named Gilberto 
Campos, who alleged that Jackson assaulted him without provocation outside 
Hawthorne Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that he merely defended himself from Campos, whose elbow was 
dislocated as he was wrestled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Although Campos was convicted in Inglewood Municipal Court of battery on a 
police officer, the city eventually agreed to pay him $3,500, Hawthorne City 
Atty. Michael Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not the First Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also acknowledged that he was the target of two minor complaints from 
prisoners in Ventura County Jail but said he had "never been found guilty of 
excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson portrayed such complaints as a price of certain professions. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors, lawyers and police officers are all vulnerable to people who believe 
that their conduct" is not proper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints did not hold back his career. He was promoted to sergeant in 
December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson said his work in Hawthorne, where 86% of the department's officers 
are white, was marred when some of his colleagues called him and other blacks 
"nigger." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was also subjected to racist jokes, such as the time a white officer 
waved a white-female doll in his face and said, "Come on Jackson, I know you 
want a white woman." 
</P>
<P>
"After two years I said, 'I'm not gaining anything by being quiet,' " he 
recalled. "I felt I was less of a man when I was putting up with that all the 
time, when it was totally disrespectful to me." 
</P>
<P>
Other Hawthorne officers say that Jackson overreacted to minor taunts that once 
seemed not to bother him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relations Strained 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, relations were strained, and department officials were relieved when 
he was placed on stress disability in April, 1987. Jackson also filed a 
lawsuit, still pending, accusing the Police Department of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
He currently receives $224 a week, about one-fourth of his pay when he was on 
regular duty. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson will not be granted a disability retirement until city officials 
determine that his stress condition is "permanent and stationary," said Doug 
Gates, Hawthorne's employee relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he makes due on his scant salary by "eating less" and living in 
his father's Inglewood condominium. His grandmother loaned him $4,000 to buy 
his video equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he resolved to begin his public fight because of an incident soon 
after he left active duty. 
</P>
<P>
Woodrow Jackson, 61, was driving home from a family gathering when he was 
stopped by police in Pomona. The elder Jackson subsequently filed a $50,000 
claim against that city, alleging that without provocation, two white officers 
grabbed him and slammed him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The experience made his "very strong" father cry, Jackson said, adding, "For me 
to see him crying was the ultimate injury." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona officials would not release details of the case, but said they expect to 
reject Jackson's claim within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed a Group 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Jackson formed Law Enforcement Officers for Justice, eventually 
recruiting about 60 other police officers, most of them black, from around Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The group publicly supported complaints of officers and citizens of racism and 
misconduct in several police departments, including those in Santa Monica and 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1987, Jackson was also carting around his video camera looking 
for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
He said he went to a series of communities -- including Beverly Hills, El 
Segundo, Glendale, Manhattan Beach and Torrance -- to test the response of 
police. In each case, officers confronted him without using excessive force, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he believes most police officers "are good guys and they are just 
trying to do their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"But you have 10%, 15% or 20% who are making everybody's life miserable because 
they are brutalizing people and then making other people react with antagonism 
toward police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Westwood Incident 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has drawn more than his share of antagonism as well, much of it after 
he drove six black youths to Westwood last February and then videotaped Los 
Angeles police as they questioned and searched the youths. He said the 
experiment showed that the officers were stopping blacks indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, in an videotaped speech played at 
police roll calls soon after, said Jackson was guilty of "a crazy, crazy, 
stupid, idiotic act." 
</P>
<P>
"You got cops out there who are already stressed out," said Inglewood Police 
Chief Ray Johnson, whose officers got into an argument with Jackson when he 
videotaped them making an arrest. "They are terrified. And now what do they do? 
Do they back off, or do they continue to do their jobs? 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Jackson) is trying to become a martyr. He is going way, way beyond 
what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Be Admired 
</P>
<P>
But Garland Hardeman, a Los Angeles policeman who is a friend and adviser to 
Jackson, said other officers should admire him. 
</P>
<P>
"What he has done is an obligation that we all should take," said Hardeman "No 
organization that has the power police do can (operate) on internal monitoring 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the NBC producers approached him about demonstrating one of his 
"stings" for television, leading him to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
To one of his former Hawthorne colleagues, who asked to remain anonymous, it 
was a case of Jackson using his police experience to "push all the right 
buttons" to provoke a confrontation once his car was pulled over. He noted that 
Jackson did not remain seated, as most motorists would when approached by a 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson admitted that he may have frightened Long Beach Officer Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't bait a good cop," he said. "I'm giving police what they see all 
the time -- both law-abiding black people and non-law-abiding black people. And 
they are not taking the time to discern which is which. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Dickey) went from giving me a command (to raise his hands) to using 
maximum force, which was more than was necessary," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drinking Suspected 
</P>
<P>
But Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, said Jackson was under suspicion of 
drunk driving because his car was weaving and that Dickey used "proper police 
tactics" in pushing the uncooperative Jackson up against a building. The 
breaking of the window was an "unfortunate" accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has been a busy man in the days since the incident, besieged by 
requests for interviews and feelers from movie producers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he knows, however, that agitating other policemen is an avocation that 
could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"I wake up at night sometimes, sweating," he said. "I have a dream that I have 
been shot or I get hurt. But I don't let (fear) take over." 
</P>
<P>
He also knows that policemen are not the only people who question what he does. 
</P>
<P>
When he slipped into a Los Angeles barber shop this week for a quick trim 
between television interviews, Jackson found several black men discussing "that 
Hawthorne guy." 
</P>
<P>
He said the customers did not recognize him, as one declared: "That guy is too 
damn radical. He's running around stirring up trouble all over the place. . . . 
The police are just trying to do their job." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson asked the man if "that guy" might be trying to point out a pattern of 
police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, the man bellowed, "Why, he ain't got no way of proving 
that!" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and his father laughed at the story. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm up against," Jackson concluded later, "is that even blacks side with 
the police. There is a presumption that the police are doing their job, and 
you've got to overcome that by giving people clear evidence."

 $60,000 AWARDED FOR CULTURAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded $60,000 to the Cultural 
Foundation, a San Fernando Valley group that is trying to build a cultural 
center in the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will help pay for a design competition that will provide 
architectural plans for the center by early summer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Foundation envisions an "Arts Park L.A." including a 2,500-seat 
concert hall, an open-air performance glen, a natural history museum and a 
cluster of workshops and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved is a legal challenge by environmentalists to use of the basin, 
which is a flood-control area under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of 
Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to the project is a potential $70-million price tag. 
Foundation officials said they will begin a fund-raising campaign once the 
architectural plans are completed.

 SLUMLORD PAYS FINES, TO BEGIN JAIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After rejection of his appeal, convicted slumlord William H. Burkhalter Jr. has 
paid $18,700 in fines and penalties and been ordered to surrender Feb. 23 to 
begin serving a 45-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Burkhalter, 56, was convicted by a Los Angeles Municipal Court jury on Feb. 24, 
1987, of 22 violations of fire, safety and health codes at a 63-unit apartment 
building at 1723 W. 9th St. He was sentenced by Judge Suzanne Person on March 
3, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Person also ordered him to perform 250 hours of community service at County-USC 
Medical Center and 750 hours at the U.S. Mission. In addition, he was placed on 
36 months of summary probation. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Richard Robb said Burkhalter, who no longer owns 
the now-vacant building, appealed to Superior Court, contending that the 
sentence was excessive. But the higher court's appellate department rejected 
the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Person told Burkhalter to report to her Sept. 28 on his progress in completing 
the community service.

WIDE AREA TAINTED BY OLD DDT FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contamination from a shuttered Harbor Gateway chemical plant that manufactured 
DDT for 35 years is more widespread than earlier believed and has tainted 
underground water basins as well as nearby homes and businesses, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has reported. 
</P>
<P>
Recent EPA tests found the banned pesticide and another dangerous chemical -- 
the solvent monochlorobenzene, or MCB -- in the Bellflower and Gage aquifers, 
which run underneath the site of the Montrose Chemical Corp. but do not supply 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
In both aquifers, MCB, which can cause liver and kidney damage, was much more 
prevalent than DDT, a suspected carcinogen. In the Bellflower aquifer, the one 
closest to the surface, the tests showed MCB at concentrations of 600,000 parts 
per billion -- 10,000 times the maximum standard proposed by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Two deeper aquifers -- the Lynwood and Silverado aquifers, which do feed into 
the drinking water supply -- have not yet been tested, although tests are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The lower aquifers are separated from the upper aquifers by a natural layer of 
clay, which water company officials say has generally protected the drinking 
water supply from contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assessing the Threat 
</P>
<P>
Johanna Miller, who is supervising cleanup of the site for the EPA, said 
officials are "confident that if it has reached a drinking water aquifer, the 
contamination would not have yet reached an actual drinking water well." 
</P>
<P>
The closest well is 2 miles away and has turned up no evidence of 
contamination, according to officials at the Dominguez Water Co., which 
maintains it, and the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District, 
which reviews tests conducted by all the water companies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
John Joham, district general manager, said he is not concerned about the EPA's 
findings at the former Montrose plant. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we want to keep our eye on it. We're not going to go ahead and 
ignore it and stick it in a file someplace and let it get dusty." 
</P>
<P>
The 13-acre Montrose site, on Normandie Avenue near the intersection of the 
Harbor and San Diego freeways, has been targeted for placement on the EPA's 
Superfund list of the worst toxic waste sites in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Montrose Chemical Corp. manufactured DDT there from 1947 until 1982, when 
an EPA investigation revealed unusually high concentrations of DDT in surface 
water runoff and sediments leaving the property. The plant is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted since that time continue to reveal toxic waste both on and off 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Through each phase of our investigation, we have discovered that the 
contamination has traveled farther than we would have expected," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
He said EPA officials were particularly surprised to find DDT in the two upper 
aquifers, because DDT is not generally thought to be soluble. However, it 
apparently mixed with the solvent MCB, which allowed it to spread. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dust, Soil Samples 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ground water contamination, the most recent round of EPA 
tests revealed significant levels of DDT in dust and soil samples taken from 23 
homes and businesses near the Montrose site. The EPA report said the 
contamination is not serious enough to produce "any immediate health effects." 
</P>
<P>
Area residents, however, are skeptical. And they are frustrated over the 
long-delayed cleanup of the site, which was originally scheduled for completion 
in 1986 but will not begin for at least another year.

CROSS SET ABLAZE OUTSIDE BLACK FAMILY'S HOME; 
</P>
<P>
4 HAD MOVED TO SANTA CLARITA 2 MONTHS AGO TO LIVE 'SOMEPLACE THAT WAS SAFER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A black man, who said he moved his family to Santa Clarita from Sepulveda two 
months ago because he wanted to live "someplace that was safer," discovered a 
burning 8-foot cross in front of his house early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Quals, 31, said he had just quieted his restless 9-month-old son with a 
pacifier about 2 a.m. when he spotted the blazing cross through a front window 
of his home on Crestview Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'This can't be California,' " Quals said. 
</P>
<P>
Quals said he did not see who burned the cross and has not received any 
threatening telephone calls or letters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything at this point," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. 
Harvey Cantor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fence Dispute 
</P>
<P>
But Quals told deputies that the cross-burning may have been related to a 
dispute he is having with the Hidden Valley Homeowners Assn. over his plans to 
build a fence, Cantor said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Granen, president of the 271-member homeowners group, said that some 
association members have criticized Quals' plans to build a fence. The members, 
Granen said, objected to the fact that the fence would block their views and 
would not match the housing development's architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that it's not related to this incident," Granen said of the fence 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Granen said the association's board has offered a $1,000 award for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly that racism has no place in our community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quals said he was awakened early Thursday by the cries of his infant son, 
Derrick Jr. Quals said he did not realize at first that the orange glow he saw 
through a window was the burning cross. The cross, made of wooden 2-by-4s, was 
jammed into loose dirt next to the house's brick walkway. 
</P>
<P>
Quals said he called the emergency 911 number. The first firefighter to leap 
off the fire truck minutes later was a black man, Quals said. Neither of them 
knew what to say, Quals recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he was just as disenchanted as I was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighter doused the flames with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Stores 
</P>
<P>
Quals, who owns a string of liquor stores, said he and his wife, Janice, moved 
to Newhall because they thought their neighborhood in Sepulveda was declining. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to move someplace that was safer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Quals, shaken by the incident, did not speak with reporters. The couple 
also have a daughter, English, 4. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the morning, neighbors walked over to the Quals' house to offer 
support and sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say other than I'm sorry," Lynn Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you sick," Jamie Alexander said. "I didn't think these things 
happened anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council released a statement expressing sympathy for the 
family and outrage over "this frightening and inexcusable attack." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added: "We will not tolerate such criminal activity in the city 
of Santa Clarita." 
</P>
<P>
Quals said he paid $500,000 for the Spanish-style home and will not leave the 
upscale community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a runner; I'm a fighter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of Santa Clarita last February, a 6-foot cross was burned in 
front of the home of a black teen-ager, adopted by a white couple, in Saugus. 
Later, Kory William Linder, 19, of Canyon Country was arrested and pleaded no 
contest to one count of misdemeanor terrorism and was sentenced last June to 30 
days in jail, 30 days of community service and three years' probation.

NASH, AIDE ORDERED TO TRIAL IN '81 DEATHS OF 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted drug dealer Eddie Nash and his former bodyguard were ordered Thursday 
to stand trial in the 1981 killings of four people in Laurel Canyon for which 
the late porn star John C. Holmes was tried and acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, once described by Holmes as "the most evil man I've ever known," and 
Gregory Diles were ordered to stand trial on four counts of murder, one count 
of attempted murder and special circumstance allegations that could qualify 
them for a death sentence if they are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge Marion Obera upheld the charges after a 2-week 
preliminary hearing. Nash, 59, and Diles, 40, remain in custody without bail 
pending arraignment in Superior Court on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pathological Liar' 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys argued that the prosecution's star witness, Scott Thorson, a 
former lover of the late entertainer Liberace, was a "pathological liar" and 
that the charges should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But Obera disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Thorson has made false statements under oath in civil matters, but I do 
not have a reasonable doubt about his testimony (in the criminal preliminary 
hearing)," the judge said. ". . . I don't think Mr. Thorson is so brave that he 
would make something up like that against Mr. Nash. I think he feared Mr. 
Nash." 
</P>
<P>
Thorson testified that Nash admitted feeling responsible for events that led to 
the four killings. Thorson said Nash never admitted ordering the July 1, 1981, 
killings to avenge a $1-million robbery of drugs and cash at his Studio City 
home, but that Nash later lamented that he had sent Diles and Holmes to the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt he was responsible for sending Mr. Holmes and Mr. Diles there and it 
had all turned into a bloody mess," Thorson testified. "He felt the whole thing 
had gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four people found bludgeoned to death had participated in the 
robbery, authorities said. They were William Deverell, 42, and Ronald Launius, 
37. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Victims 
</P>
<P>
Also slain in the house on Wonderland Avenue were Barbara Richardson, 22, and 
Joy Miller, 36. A fifth person, Launius' wife, Susan, 25, survived severe head 
injuries, but has been unable to identify the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, whose real name is Adel Nasrallah, was sentenced in 1982 to eight years 
in state prison for possessing cocaine for sale, and was later paroled. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson sued Liberace in 1982, claiming that in return for being the 
entertainer's former live-in chauffeur and lover, the entertainer promised him 
$70,000 a year for life. The suit was settled out of court in 1984. Liberace 
died of AIDS in February, 1987.

BOTH SIDES IN NIGHT STALKER TRIAL ALLEGE 'GROUP BIAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer, 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense and prosecution lawyers in the impending Night Stalker trial have 
accused one another of systematically excluding people of certain races from 
serving on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations, made late Thursday afternoon, forced Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Michael A. Tynan to order the lawyers back to court this morning to 
argue over the charges. 
</P>
<P>
If either side is unable to refute the charges, Tynan may have to declare a 
mistrial, which would force jury selection for the long-delayed case to begin 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is alleging that co-prosecutors Phil Halpin and Alan Yochelson have 
systematically excluded black women and Latinos from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy district attorneys are alleging that Daniel Hernandez, defendant 
Richard Ramirez's lawyer, has systematically excluded Anglos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
The development is unusual because lawyers usually never have to explain why 
they have excused prospective jurors while exercising routine "peremptory" 
challenges. It is even more unusual for both sides to make such allegations of 
racially motivated exclusion in picking a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a lawyer uses a peremptory challenge only when he believes a juror 
may be biased against him or his client. State law defines such a challenge as 
one for which "no reason need be given. 
</P>
<P>
After the charges surfaced Thursday, Tynan said from the bench that "the 
numbers require me to hold a hearing," referring to the alleged number of 
jurors who might have been excused by the lawyers because of ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
The jury now has six Latinos and five blacks. A sixth black juror was excused 
for misconduct Tuesday for having said he would not condemn a Latino to die 
because there already is a disproportionate number of minorities on the 
nation's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Jury 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's allegations of "group bias" arose during the selection of a 
13-member alternate jury, one of whom would be picked at random as the 12th 
juror. The trial, set to start Jan. 30, may take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of group bias was the subject of a landmark 1978 California Supreme 
Court ruling that such systematic exclusion "violates the right to trial by a 
jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community" under the 
state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, known as People vs. Wheeler, the court said that if a trial judge 
finds credible evidence of group bias, the party accused of discriminating must 
prove that its peremptory challenges had not been "predicated on group bias 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Such reasons have to be "very specific and factual," one prominent defense 
lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If such a showing cannot be made, the trial judge must then declare a mistrial, 
according to the People vs. Wheeler decision. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, an all-white jury had convicted two black men of murdering a 
white grocer during a robbery. The high court examined the trial record and 
found that the men's defense attorneys had made "a prima facie showing" that 
the prosecution had exercised its peremptory challenges against black jurors 
"on the ground of group bias alone." The court then reversed the convictions 
and ordered a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a Latino drifter from El Paso, Tex., is accused of murdering 13 Los 
Angeles County residents in a spree of nighttime residential attacks that left 
many others injured. He also faces 30 additional felony counts here -- as well 
as a 14th murder charge in San Francisco and attempted murder and sexual 
assault counts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has been held in Los Angeles County Jail since he was captured by 
citizens in East Los Angeles on Labor Day Weekend in 1985. Jury selection in 
the case began July 21.

UCLA IS ITS OWN WORST ENEMY BUT STILL WINS, 94-84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's 94-84 victory over Arizona State Thursday night before a crowd of 5,896 
at Pauley Pavilion probably says more about the sorry state of the Sun Devils 
than it does about the strength of the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that the Bruins weren't impressive at times, especially in 
the second half, when they outscored the Sun Devils by more than 20 points 
before Coach Jim Harrick cleared his bench in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, though, is fast sinking into the depths of the Pacific 10 
Conference without its leader, Tarence Wheeler, a sophomore point guard who 
injured his right knee 2 weeks ago and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we really showed some progress as a team," said Sun Devil Coach 
Steve Patterson, who wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
ASU's previous 3 losses were by 24, 29 and 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils, though, stayed even with UCLA throughout a sloppy first half 
that probably was the Bruins' worst of the season. 
</P>
<P>
It was so bad, in fact, that Harrick gathered his players just before the start 
of the second half and admonished them. 
</P>
<P>
What did he tell them? 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'If we ever get an opportunity to go to the NCAA tournament, 
we've got to have a little bit of pride in our game,' " Harrick said. " 'It 
starts right here and right now -- develop some pride and show that you can 
come out and play every night.' " 
</P>
<P>
Harrick was delighted with the Bruins' response. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who held a 36-35 advantage at halftime, steadily widened the gap, 
finally putting the Sun Devils away with a 15-2 run that gave UCLA an 83-62 
lead with 5 minutes 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Darrick Martin capped the spurt with an acrobatic 3-point play, 
hanging in the air as he was fouled by Matt Anderson and flipping a layup over 
his head and into the basket as he was falling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Bruins showed that they're a very explosive team," Patterson said. 
"We played with them for perhaps 35 minutes, but in one 5-minute stretch, they 
sort of cut our throats." 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Bruins' record to 10-4, including a 5-1 conference 
mark that moved them into sole possession of second place in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, which will play USC Saturday at the Sports Arena while UCLA 
plays at Stanford, fell to 8-7 and 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bruins, Martin enjoyed his most productive game of the season, making 6 
of 7 shots, including both of his 3-pointers, and scoring a season-high 16 
points to go with 5 assists and 3 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Don MacLean made 7 of 10 shots and had 21 points, 8 rebounds and a 
season-high 4 assists; Trevor Wilson had 18 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists, 
and Pooh Richardson had 19 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Edwards led Arizona State, scoring 19 points (on 9-of-13 shooting) and 
grabbing 8 rebounds. Edwards, a 6-foot 7-inch, 237-pound forward who started 
his college career as a football player at TCU, also had 2 technical fouls, 
drawing his second for throwing an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they like Edwards, to tell you the truth," Patterson said of the 
officials. "For some reason, officials think he's overly aggressive and rough 
around the edges. Or maybe he looks too much like a football player." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick didn't think it was a particularly physical game. 
</P>
<P>
"Not from our standpoint," he said. "We haven't touched anybody yet." 
</P>
<P>
For a half, the uninspired Bruins were mostly awful, turning the ball over 11 
times in the first 20 minutes and generally looking sloppy even when things 
went right. 
</P>
<P>
Would it behoove the Bruins, Harrick was asked, to play better against 
Stanford, winner of 8 straight games before losing Thursday night at Cal? 
</P>
<P>
"Against any good team it would behoove you not to play like we did in the 
first half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State, though, isn't a good team, especially since it is playing 
without its 2 best players, Wheeler and center Emory Lewis, who has not played 
this season because of a stress fracture in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
And so, UCLA was able to survive its own ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we were in a little bit of a hurry," Harrick said. "But we 
settled down." 
</P>
<P>
Once they did, the Sun Devils were finished. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
According to Sports Illustrated, Athletic Director Peter Dalis of UCLA 
suggested this week that universities that have shied away from incoming 
freshmen who do not meet the academic requirements of the NCAA's controversial 
Proposition 48, including UCLA, might break off from the NCAA and play among 
themselves. Thursday, Dalis said that UCLA has no intention of breaking from 
the NCAA. His suggestion, he said, was that schools with similar academic 
philosophies might form their own division within the NCAA. He added, however, 
that the idea probably was not practical. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has awarded a scholarship to backup center Keith Owens, a former walk-on. 
There had been a question as to whether the Bruins had a scholarship to give. 
Because of recruiting violations in the case of Carl Pitts, who never played at 
UCLA, the Bruins had 2 scholarships taken away this year by the NCAA. . . . 
Guard Matt Anderson, who had been starting for Arizona State, was demoted by 
Coach Steve Patterson but came off the bench to score a career-high 18 points.

SUPER BOWL XXIII: CINCINNATI BENGALS VS. SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS;

COMMENTARY;

THIS IS THE TIME TO GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're running a reality check in Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to look in the mirror, America. Are you sure you know where your soul 
is? 
</P>
<P>
The local riots have cast a shadow over Super Bowl XXIII that won't go away. 
What are you going to say: "All that's left is sporadic violence; pass me one 
of those deviled eggs with the caviar on top."? 
</P>
<P>
Dismay is written on the faces of the local organizers. Miami did everything 
Los Angeles did and Seoul did. It built the hotels, scheduled the parties, put 
up replicas of 28 team helmets on the light poles on I-95, the route to Joe 
Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The suites and luxury boxes were readied, the yachts and limos assembled. The 
caterers designed their pavilions for the corporations' game-day brunches 
outside the stadium, with potted palms, giant TVs, big-name rock bands and 
buffets with pate de foie gras and vintage wines. 
</P>
<P>
The stars descended: eight astronauts, John Cougar Mellencamp, the Bangles, 
Maureen Reagan, Burt Reynolds, Willie Nelson, Maria Conchita Alonso, Julio 
Iglesias, Linda Ronstadt, Robin Williams, Billy Joel, Christie Brinkley, 
Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful brokered: The Miami Herald reported that Sen. Edward Kennedy got 
10 rooms for valued contributors at the 
booked-to-capacity-for-this-weekend-since-the-dawn-of-time Sonesta Beach Hotel 
on Key Biscayne by calling Alan Fein, a Miami lawyer and Democratic Party 
activist, who in turn called Steve Sonnabend, whose family manages the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The league, adroit as any Los Angeles agency at public relations and aware that 
unfettered hedonism, though the order of the day, doesn't really play, took 
pains to demonstrate it has a social conscience, too. 
</P>
<P>
It made a charitable grant . . . and put out a release to advertise the fact: 
</P>
<P>
"MIAMI -- The National Football League will award $5,000 educational grants to 
two deserving South Florida black high school seniors this spring, NFL Director 
of Equal Employment David Cornwell announced today. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" 'Commissioner (Pete) Rozelle and the NFL owners want to make sure that there 
are direct benefits to the local minority community from the Miami area's 
hosting of Super Bowl XXIII,' said Cornwell." 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch, whipping up the froth for its commercials, flew in Spuds 
McKenzie and the Spudettes, passed out "Bud Bowl I" baseball caps and threw a 
party where you could meet Bob Costas and Paul Maguire and have your picture 
taken with the famous pooch. 
</P>
<P>
How big is the Super Bowl? Companies advertise their advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser Busch is happy to tell you it paid $1 million to shoot the spots, $4 
million for the commercial time and an amount it doesn't want to disclose to 
promote the project. 
</P>
<P>
There were the usual tales of let-them-eat-cake ribaldry. A dentist in 
Hollywood, Fla., offered a ticket and use of his car and condo for $15,000 as a 
joke . . . and got takers . . . and got on TV. 
</P>
<P>
All this is standard Super Bowl fare, phenomena that have been noted for years 
and smiled at. 
</P>
<P>
Did they suggest a skewing of societal priorities? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe, but no one ever really seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Is there something we're missing? There are a lot of people who aren't invited, 
who are poor and getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cincinnati Bengals' hotel, Eddie Brown could have watched his old 
neighborhood burn. Brown, who could run a 4.4-second 40 and catch passes, was 
upwardly mobile and moved out. 
</P>
<P>
An entire black middle class has emerged . . . and moved out of the ghettos, 
leaving what is known as the permanent underclass with little hope and no role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of poor blacks in Miami is aggravated by peculiar local factors: the 
successive waves of immigration from Central America; the psychic wound of 
seeing the Cubans rise to civic power; the tendency of Hispanic employers to 
hire Hispanics; the strain caused by competing demands on already-limited 
social services. Super Bowl XXIII didn't cause these riots; this was the fourth 
time in the 1980s that Overtown or Liberty City or both have gone up. 
</P>
<P>
In all fairness, when the riots hit, NFL officials did manifest concern. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, most of the concern they expressed was for their pretty game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rozelle Tuesday: "I feel for (the Miami organizers). The one big plus is 
that it's early in the week." 
</P>
<P>
One big plus? 
</P>
<P>
There was the difficulty in the media of discerning the different levels of 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
From USA Today: 
</P>
<P>
"MIAMI -- When he arrived . . . NBC's Merlin Olsen sensed a pall -- and it 
wasn't just the sad reports of the nearby riots. Few were talking about the 
game. You know, Cincinnati vs. San Francisco in Sunday's Super Bowl on NBC 
(5:18, EST, kickoff). 
</P>
<P>
" 'The only time I can remember sensing this kind of unanimous appraisal of the 
outcome was Super Bowl XV in New Orleans -- the Raiders and (Philadelphia) 
Eagles,' (Olsen said.)" 
</P>
<P>
NBC meanwhile, was in the process of deciding whether the riots were part of 
this story. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Michael Weisman, head of the sports division, 
said that he would include a segment on the riots in the 2-hour pregame show, 
"if it impacts on the Super Bowl . . . right now, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
This week was to mark Miami's new vibrancy. It was once the salvation of this 
game, giving the NFL its first sellout after Super Bowl I in Los Angeles played 
before 30,000 empty seats in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The league was so grateful, it returned twice in the next 3 years. But it grew 
tired of the cramped Orange Bowl and the hotels raising prices over even the 
normally usurious winter rates, and it hadn't brought the game here since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Miami was only playing the party game that has worked so well for everyone else 
-- throw a big bash, wine and dine the VIPs, shoot off some fireworks and let 
the world know there's a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some citizens for whom the same old deal prevailed were aroused 
Monday night by the sight of a policeman shooting an unarmed motorcyclist, who 
was being pursued by another officer for nothing more than a speeding 
violation. On such acts is history borne and on such reactions are our 
consciences tweaked. 
</P>
<P>
And if they are, that's the one big plus.

SCORING TOUCH GONE, KINGS FALL TO ISLANDERS 
</P>

It's as apparent as the ache in Wayne Gretzky's left side, the pain in Tim 
Watters' neck or the lump in Glenn Healy's throat. 
</P>
<P>
The King Capades, the flashiest show on skates, has taken a hiatus, at least 
temporarily. After scoring goals faster than owner Bruce McNall can count the 
coins in his collection, the Kings came within 4 minutes Thursday night of 
being shut out by the New York Islanders, the team with the worst record in the 
National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after ex-Islander John Tonelli scored twice within 69 seconds to avoid 
the Kings' first shutout in 219 games, King defenseman Steve Duchesne did 
everything short of slipping a banana peel in front of the Islanders' David 
Volek in an effort to trip him but failed, allowing Volek to score the 
empty-net goal with 22 seconds left that sealed the Islanders' 4-2 win over the 
Kings before 14,552 fans at Nassau Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to trip him," said Duchesne, the only man back after the Kings blitzed 
Islander goalie Kelly Hrudey for a full 40 seconds in an effort to score the 
tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make him fall, but I couldn't. He's very strong. I just lost my 
grip, and they scored." 
</P>
<P>
The loss, the second straight on this trip, dropped the Kings 10 points behind 
first-place Calgary, a 7-2 winner over Boston, in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of games have not been good for us," said Tonelli, who scored 
2 goals here the last time he faced his former mates in a 4-3 win in December. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing a lot of little battles out there, and when you're losing the 
little battles they grow to be big ones." 
</P>
<P>
The fight is that much tougher with a subpar Gretzky, who didn't skate in 
practice Wednesday, went 2 periods Thursday night without a shot on net, then 
hit a post in the third before finally assisting on Tonelli's second goal. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has a pulled muscle in his left side, and while he said that's no 
reason to stop playing, his game has clearly suffered. He was on the ice for 4 
goals by the St. Louis Blues Tuesday night in the Kings' 5-2 defeat by the 
Blues, and he was on for all 4 Islander goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders took a 2-0 lead on power-play goals by Brent Sutter and Pat 
LaFontaine in the first period, then put Healy under siege in the second 
period, outshooting the Kings, 18-4. 
</P>
<P>
While the Kings failed to get a shot in the last half of the period, Pat 
Flatley made it 3-0 at 16:13, scoring from right in front after Gretzky tipped 
an Islander pass directly to Islander defenseman Richard Pilon. 
</P>
<P>
Healy was flattened with 5:27 left in the game when a rising slapshot by Sutter 
from just inside the blue line struck him in the throat. He remained in the 
game, though he was in no mood to sing in the showers afterward. "We're not 
surprising anybody anymore," Healy said. "Things came easy for us early in the 
season -- we scored a lot of goals. We have to start doing the small things 
again to turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
Other teams, Tonelli said, are taking advantage of the Kings physically. The 
absence of the Kings' toughest defenseman, Ken Baumgartner, still recuperating 
from the flu, was compounded by the unavailability of Watters, who strained his 
neck in St. Louis and is on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The Islanders were getting the best of things bodywise," Tonelli said. "They 
were checking us closely, keeping us from going up (the) ice. We have to learn 
to fight that off and not accept it." 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders, who outshot the Kings, 38-23, kept getting the best of the 
Kings. Hrudey robbed Duchesne with a glove save of his blast 4 minutes into the 
final period, and Mike Krushelnyski and Gretzky hit posts before Tonelli 
finally broke through, stealing a bad clearing pass from Bryan Trottier and 
beating Hrudey with a slapshot from the top of the left circle at 16:06. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see Trots make a mistake like that very often," said Tonelli of the 
embattled Trottier, a long-time All-Star whose playing time has been cut 
considerably. "It had to be an honest mistake, because you never see him make a 
mistake like that." 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli took a pass from Gretzky and pulled the trigger again from about 15 
feet away to make it 3-2 at 17:15, and he was on the ice for the Kings' last 
futile flurry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to understand that the last half of the season will be much tougher 
for us," Tonelli said. "We have to pick it up a step." 
</P>
<P>
And it's no time to take a break, Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sore," he said of his side. "But you've got to play 80 games. It's as 
simple as that."

TEXAS IS IN LOVE WITH RUN-AND-FUN BASKETBALL 
</P>

AUSTIN, Texas

<P>
Tom Penders entered the reception hall in the Erwin Center, the University of 
Texas' plush, 16,000-seat arena, to applause, and threaded his way between 
tables to the microphone at one side of the room. Munching popcorn and sipping 
mixed drinks in the hall, known unofficially as the Burnt Orange Room, were 
several hundred Texas fans, the most orange-blooded of the 12,647 who had just 
witnessed the Longhorns' game with Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Penders, Texas' first-year coach, answered questions about the game and then 
told the gathering: "It's important to do this even when we lose." More 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Texas had, only an hour earlier, lost an important Southwest Conference 
basketball game to Arkansas. But if someone had wandered into the Burnt Orange 
Room without seeing the game, he easily could have gotten a different 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no unrealistic expectations here," Penders said later. "People are 
telling me after the game, 'Please hang in there, coach. We're just happy to 
have you here.' They're cheering up." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about appreciative people, a man, fortyish, standing behind Penders in 
line at an Austin grocery store plunked down a $100 bill and offered to pay for 
Penders' groceries -- and this was six months before Penders would even coach a 
game. Penders, taken aback, declined the man's offer and later asked Steve 
Ross, UT's basketball publicist, "Hey, what exactly happened here?" 
</P>
<P>
If Penders, the former Columbia and Fordham coach, is enjoying a nice, cozy 
honeymoon in Austin, it's because Texas fans and Texas basketball are just now 
reconciling after a long separation. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, Penders, hired by Texas after two 20-win seasons at Rhode Island, has 
given UT fans plenty to shout about in a 12-3 season. But more important than 
the record is the way Penders' upbeat personality and up-tempo game have 
revitalized a program that had languished under Bob Weltlich, the Bob Knight 
protege who replaced the popular Abe Lemons in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is asking Tom for a national championship," said John Danks, a former 
UT player and coach under Lemons who is now a lobbyist in Austin. "We're just 
excited to have a competitive team and happy players. Regardless of what 
happens this year, we know we have a chance to go somewhere in the future. 
Under Weltlich, we didn't have that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Ready, willing and able to play Penders' up-tempo style, the Longhorns have 
scored more than 100 points six times and savored every minute of it. "Perfect 
choice," said junior guard Travis Mays, whose nine three-pointers against Rice 
last week set an SWC record. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lemons in the late '70s, Texas made a move as a basketball school. NIT 
champions in 1978, the Longhorns appeared destined for greater things in '82 
when they got off to a 14-0 start. But that team lost 11 of its final 13 games 
when one of its stars, forward Mike Wacker, suffered a severe knee injury. 
Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds fired Lemons when the season was finished. 
</P>
<P>
The situation only got messier when Weltlich, who had dragged the Mississippi 
program into the 20th century, failed to produce at Texas. Weltlich was a 
Knight foot soldier, all right, but without the championship banners, and his 
six seasons were marked by community apathy and player unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling Weltlich's practices, which were closed to the media and public, Mays 
said: "He'd have us diving on the floor. He was breaking our bodies down. At 
this point in the season under Coach Weltlich, we would be tired. Coach Penders 
understands. We'll play hard, win a game, he'll give us a day off. But Coach 
Weltlich would have us in here the next day going just as hard. We were all 
banged up. My freshman year, I was hampered with injuries. My sophomore year, 
injury after injury after injury. It was the abuse, the physical abuse, we were 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
After last season, in which the Longhorns were 16-13 and first-round losers in 
the SWC tournament, Dodds called the players in to discuss Weltlich. The 
players told Dodds they were tired of Weltlich's walk-it-up style and constant 
negativism. The meeting pushed Weltlich over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, in the East, Penders' Rhode Island team was pushing the ball up-court 
and beating Missouri and Syracuse on the way to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. 
Dodds noticed, and he sought Penders out for an interview at the Final Four in 
Kansas City. Dodds says he needed only "about 15 minutes of one interview" to 
know he had his man. Penders had been talking to Rutgers about the coaching 
vacancy there, but when he heard what the Texas job paid -- a total package of 
$200,000 a year -- he jumped on it. (Only four seasons ago Penders was earning 
about $40,000 a year and paying for his parking space at Fordham.) 
</P>
<P>
Texas had an antidote for Weltlich, and, after 17 years of toiling in musty, 
bandbox gyms, Penders had found basketball heaven, a school with first-class 
facilities and deep pockets. "Everything is there," he said. "It's the first 
situation -- well, I've been in such lousy situations. My total recruiting 
budget at Fordham was about one-tenth the size of what we have here." 
</P>
<P>
Penders certainly walked into a nice situation. He inherited a full complement 
of players, four of them returning starters, good people -- "Nobody's come up 
to my office and asked for his monthly payment" -- as well as good athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But he must create a recruiting presence for the Longhorns, who, in Danks' 
words, "haven't out-recruited anybody for anybody in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
To Texas' facilities and resources, Penders has added his run-and-fun style and 
the ultimate weapon, national television exposure. Cashing in a chip from his 
Rhode Island success, he hustled up a network TV game (CBS) for Texas at 
Vanderbilt Saturday. The Longhorns' non-conference schedule next season will be 
tougher -- including games with LSU, Oklahoma, Florida and Cal-Santa Barbara -- 
bringing more TV opportunities and, Penders hopes, opening more recruiting 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Penders wants to tie up the high school talent in Texas, much of which now 
leaves the SWC, while bagging a big-time national recruit or two. Texas thought 
it might get one last fall in Jamal Faulkner, the 6-7 forward from Christ the 
King High School in New York. Faulkner visited Texas but ended up signing with 
Pitt. Said Penders: "I think if we had a year under our belt here, we would 
have had him." 
</P>
<P>
In the Burnt Orange Room these days, they would not disagree.

WILANDER LOSES, AND LENDL TRIES FOR NO. 1 
</P>

MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After just 2 matches, Mats Wilander is gone from the Australian Open, but his 
No. 1 ranking may not be going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander's sudden and shocking departure from the year's first Grand Slam, the 
result of a straight-set loss early Thursday evening to Ramesh Krishnan of 
India, sent the rest of the top men's singles players elbowing each other to 
replace him as defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilander, who lost to Krishnan, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), may keep his No. 1 
ranking after all. There is only one player who can replace him: Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl can become No. 1 again in the near future, but only if he wins the 
Australian Open, which would give him enough points to move ahead of Wilander 
in the computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl won his second-round match Friday morning, defeating Carl-Uwe Steeb, 6-2, 
2-6, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, top-seeded Steffi Graf breezed through a 47-minute, 6-0, 
6-1 victory over Marianne Werdel. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who fought off 3 match points before finally losing, had a simple 
explanation for what went wrong: "I just played terrible." 
</P>
<P>
After being forced to go 5 sets before winning his first-round match, Wilander 
knew he was far from the top of his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I came into the match in a bad way," he said. "I don't know. To me, 
it's just been difficult to motivate myself after the U.S. Open because that, 
for me, was such a big thing." 
</P>
<P>
Since his success at the Open, when he replaced Lendl as No. 1 in the world, 
Wilander has fallen upon hard times. He was an early loser in the Nabisco 
Masters and then was a shocking loser to West German Steeb in the Davis Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander lost in 5 sets after being up 2 sets and a break. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after his latest disappointment, Wilander said he is going to consider 
taking a break from tennis. He said the last time he had such a concentration 
lapse, he tried something different. 
</P>
<P>
"That was in 1986 and that was from playing bad," he said. "This is from 
playing good, I guess. Then, I took time off and got married. I'm already 
married, so I can't do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Unexpected as Wilander's defeat might have been, it was not the first time a 
defending champion or top-seeded player lost in the second round of a Grand 
Slam. 
</P>
<P>
It last occurred in 1987, when top-seeded and defending champion Boris Becker 
lost in the second round at Wimbledon to Peter Doohan. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan said of Wilander: "This is probably the worst I've seen him play." 
</P>
<P>
Stefan Edberg, seeded No. 4, turned in another strong performance and won his 
second-round match Friday, defeating Heiner Moraing of West Germany, 6-4, 7-5, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Other men's singles winners in early matches Friday were Johan Kriek, Darren 
Cahill, Thomas Muster and Amos Mansdorf. 
</P>
<P>
They advance to the third round with Becker and Miloslav Mecir, who won matches 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Sukova and Hana Mandlikova won their matches Thursday, as did Martina 
Navratilova, who defeated Jenny Byrne, 6-4, 7-6. Pam Shriver moved to the third 
round with a difficult 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Sarah Loosemore.

MORNING BRIEFING: MAGAZINE GETS BACK INTO SWIM OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Sport magazine swore off swimsuit issues, giving readers a sports 
calendar instead. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no sexy pictures there . . . but you don't have to hide it from your 
kid either," the magazine's editor said in a message in the January-February 
1988 issue. 
</P>
<P>
It must not have sold too well. 
</P>
<P>
Sport's latest issue recently hit the stands with a dark-haired model on the 
cover, appropriately dressed for what the headline called its "hot swimsuit 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Said executive editor Kelly Garrett: "Our readers are going to be happy that 
Sport magazine changed its mind." 
</P>
<P>
Add Swimsuit: Sport is reviving its swimsuit issue as Sports Illustrated 
prepares for the 25th anniversary of its swimsuit edition. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated's initial swimsuit issue was designed to brighten up the 
dark days between football and baseball, when Northern cities are snowbound. 
The swimsuit issues have sparked protests that the sections are sexist. Despite 
the complaints, Publisher Donald Barr said that Sports Illustrated had fewer 
than 50 cancellations because of last year's swimsuit issue. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated expects to sell nearly 5.5 million copies of the 1989 issue 
-- which hits newsstands Feb. 6 -- compared with 3 million for regular issues. 
Inside Sports has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands, hoping to sell 
850,000 copies, compared to the usual 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Sports' first swimsuit issue was a parody of Sports Illustrated's, 
showing pretty women in swimwear with rolled-up copies of the competition's 
swimsuit issue. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jerry Croft of Inside Sports: "It was so well received that we decided we 
would keep doing our own every year." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Swimsuit: Publisher Lew Green of Sport makes no apology for the change 
in philosophy on swimsuit issues. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "What we are showing here is appropriate for a young male audience. 
It's part of what sports are all about." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, insists that he's not selling 
autographs when he organizes shows featuring popular players. 
</P>
<P>
But if you wanted to have a baseball legend's autograph at the show Rose 
promoted last Saturday through Monday in Atlantic City, N.J., you had to pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Aaron cost $15. Harmon Killebrew was a bargain at $7. Willie Mays cost 
$12. If you wanted Mickey Mantle, you had to buy a $150 "superticket," which 
allowed you one signature from each of the living major league baseball players 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rose said: "We don't make anybody pay for an autograph. We have an 
admission to get in the place, and the selection is there if you want it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like paying to get into a show. Then, if you want popcorn, you pay 
for the popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Eddie Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals grew up in the Overtown 
section of Miami, and his family now lives in Liberty City, two parts of town 
where riots have broken outthis week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm respected in the area," said Brown, who was an All-American at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was willing to go into his old neighborhood and try to calm 
things down, Brown said: "I'm not that respected." 
</P>

Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, at a speaking engagement in Omaha: "I don't think 
there is anybody else in this world who can be happier than me. There might be 
some guy in China who can tie me or something, but nobody can beat me."

NEWSWIRE: NOTRE DAME CORNERBACK COLLAPSES, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Satterfield, a Notre Dame cornerback who previously attended Notre Dame 
High School in Sherman Oaks, collapsed and died in a nightclub near South Bend, 
Ind., early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield, 22, died at 3 a.m., EST, at Pawatang Hospital in Niles, Mich., 
after collapsing at O'Tay's Nightclub in Niles, about 5 miles from the Notre 
Dame campus, sports information director John Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary autopsy indicated that Satterfield, 22, had suffered a seizure, 
followed by cardiac arrest, according to Notre Dame physician James M. 
Moriarity. 
</P>
<P>
Test results showed no alcohol or drugs in Satterfield's blood at the time of 
his death, Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only significant findings of the autopsy examination were an inequality of 
the size of the coronary arteries and the presence of increased fluids 
surrounding the brain tissue," Heisler said. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield and the Notre Dame team attended a White House reception in honor 
of its national championship on Wednesday. He was with defensive end Darrell 
Gordon and tailback Mark Green when he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was feeling fine," Gordon told the South Bend Tribune. "He had been dancing 
some earlier, but we were just sitting there at the table, just talking and 
joking, and all of a sudden he collapsed to the ground. It looked like he was 
having a seizure." 
</P>
<P>
After playing for Coach Kevin Rooney at Notre Dame High, Satterfield went to 
South Bend as a walk-on and was awarded an athletic scholarship last August. He 
was listed as a 6-foot, 181-pound cornerback and appeared in 2 games in 1988, 
shifting to offense and rushing twice for 9 yards.

The presidents of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and of the 
organization's Presidents Commission said they would recommend postponing the 
enactment of Proposal 42, the controversial proposal to tighten academic 
eligibility guidelines for freshmen athletes. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Georgetown University and the Southeastern Conference, a 
meeting was held Thursday to discuss "the wide range of academic, athletics and 
socio-economic concerns" arising from Proposal 42's passage, the NCAA said in a 
statement. The NCAA Academic Requirements Committee "wanted no changes made in 
Proposition 48 (now in force)," the statement said, adding that "the majority 
of the Division I chief executive officers of the Presidents Commission 
concurred." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, NCAA President Albert M. Witte and Martin Massengale, chairman of 
the Presidents Commission, "will recommend to the NCAA Council and the Division 
I membership of the Presidents Commission that legislation be introduced at the 
next convention to postpone any changes" until a study of Prop. 48 is 
completed.

The NCAA rules committee voted down a proposal that would have established a 
tiebreaking system in football. The plan would have given each team 4 downs 
from the opponent's 25-yard line. The teams would have alternated until one 
scored, with the other then given a chance to respond.

AFTER SLOW START, ELLIOTT FINISHES OFF USC, 97-69; 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA ALL-AMERICAN MISSES DUNK, THEN GETS HOT, ENDS UP WITH 26 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sean Elliott, Arizona's All-American forward, slithered to the basket for an 
easy dunk early in the second half of Thursday night's game against USC. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd held its breath in anticipation of an electrifying jam. Would it be a 
360-degree reverse? A double pump? 
</P>
<P>
The ball slipped out of Elliott's hands and off the rim. Talk about an 
embarrassing moment. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott more than made up for his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the dunk, Elliott missed just one other shot, scoring 26 points 
as the Wildcats defeated the Trojans, 97-69, before 4,387 fans at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After a miserable start in which he missed 6 of 8 shots and scored only 7 
points in the first half, Elliott scored 19 points in the second half, hitting 
5 of 7 shots, including a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott also had 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 blocked shot in 34 minutes. After 
Elliott left the game with 5:52 remaining, the crowd headed for the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring in double figures for the 89th consecutive game, Elliott moved into 
second place on the Pac-10 career scoring list, passing UCLA's Reggie Miller. 
Elliott has 2,116 points, 210 behind Bruin Lew Alcindor's record of 2,336. 
</P>
<P>
"Elliott is a great player," USC Coach George Raveling said. "We tried to make 
him work as hard as he could to make his shots. We tried to wear him down." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans smothered Elliott with a tenacious defense in the first half, 
double-teaming him whenever he touched the ball. It was so rough that Elliott 
got a bruise on his forehead. He held an ice bag to his head as he talked to 
reporters after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really intense," Elliott said. "They came after me at the beginning of 
the first half. I didn't adjust in the second half. I just kept shooting. The 
shots I was taking were perfect shots and I figured the law of averages had to 
catch up." 
</P>
<P>
Center Anthony Cook, the other half of Arizona's 1-2 punch, scored 23 points 
and had 7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cook also said USC played a physical game, accusing the Trojans of dirty 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
USC center Chris Munk was ejected after getting too physical with Cook with 
10:17 left in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Munk) was throwing a lot of cheap shots. That's why he got ejected," Cook 
said. "One time I was taking the ball out of bounds and he grabbed my . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction was to hit him. Then I got to the bench, and (teammate) 
Bryan David said he (Munk) had got him in the same place. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he (Munk) got his schooling from. I've seen people get 
dirty, but that's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Munk had a different version of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Cook's comment, Munk said: "He said that? I didn't grab him there. 
That's bogus. I don't remember anything like that taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Munk said he was ejected for setting an illegal pick on Cook. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stepped up to set a pick and he ran right into me," Munk said. "The ref 
made the call he thought was necessary in his eyes, and I can't argue with it." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said: "I don't think there was anything personal. I didn't see the 
play, but the referee was adamant that he (Munk) was out. There wasn't much I 
could say. I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The ninth-ranked Wildcats are 13-2 overall and 7-1 in the Pac-10. After losing 
its fifth straight game, USC fell to 7-9 and 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
Although USC stayed with Arizona for the first 16 minutes of the game, rallying 
within a point, the Wildcats closed out the first half with a 15-6 spurt and 
wound up embarrassing the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm puzzled," Raveling said. "In the first half, I thought we played good 
basketball except for our foul shooting. In the second half, we looked like we 
came out of the locker room and put on different uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm greatly disappointed that we didn't come out with more enthusiasm in the 
second half, particularly since we were playing against a nationally ranked 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman led USC with 20 points, and Chris Moore added 14. Guard 
Anthony Pendleton, USC's leading scorer, had just 4 points. He missed 4 of 5 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott said he was rattled by Wednesday night's earthquake. "I almost 
slept with my shoes on," he said. "When the earthquake hit, I was ready to jump 
off the third-floor balcony. It was like a truck hit the hotel." . . . Laker 
General Manager Jerry West and and his assistant, Mitch Kupchak, attended the 
game, presumably to scout Elliott. Arizona plays Villanova Saturday at Tucson 
in a nationally televised game. . . . USC plays Arizona State Saturday at 3 
p.m. at the Sports Arena.

Leonard Taylor had 21 points and 12 rebounds, leading California to a 75-64 
Pacific 10 Conference upset of 20th-ranked Stanford Thursday night at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Cal (13-5 overall, 4-3 in the Pac-10) scored 14 consecutive points and held 
Stanford scoreless during 5 1/2 minutes late in game to take command. The Bears 
hit 24 of 29 free throws in the second half, including 16 in a row at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lichti scored 18 points for Stanford (13-4, 5-2).

<P>
Oregon State 71, Washington 70 -- Gary Payton scored 14 of his 19 points in the 
second half, and the Beavers rallied from a 13-point deficit to beat the 
Huskies at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers (11-4, 4-3) scored 11 straight points to take a 70-61 lead with 
1:46 left and held on despite making only 1 of 5 free throws down the stretch. 
</P>

<P>
Loyola Marymount will play the Northwest portion of its West Coast Athletic 
Conference basketball schedule with games against Gonzaga at Spokane, Wash., 
tonight and at Portland Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (8-6) are tied for first in the WCAC with St. Mary's and Pepperdine 
at 2-0. Gonzaga (10-5) and Portland (1-14) are both 1-1 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola continues to lead the nation in scoring with an average of 113 points a 
game, behind its high-scoring trio of Hank Gathers, 33.9 points; Jeff Fryer, 
23.8, and Enoch Simmons, 20.6. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga is 5-1 at home but has a thin lineup without center Paul Verret, who 
broke an ankle recently. Guards Doug Spradley and Jim McPhee carry the load, 
combining for an average of 40 points a game. ALAN DROOZ

49ER WOMEN HAND SAN DIEGO STATE FIRST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State's women's basketball team once again stumbled in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs came into Thursday night's game against Cal State Long Beach with a 
14-0 record and ranked 12th in the nation -- and lost, 99-80, before 1,484 fans 
at the University Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, San Diego State carried a 15-0 record into the Long Beach game 
and lost. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25 years these two teams have been driving up and down the San Diego 
Freeway to play one another, Long Beach is 47-1. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the presence of Chana Perry, San Diego's talented center, could 
invigorate a listless Aztec team. Meanwhile, the 49ers (11-4) were as peppy as 
they have been all season. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach took over sole possession of first place in the Big West Conference 
with a 5-0 record. San Diego State (14-1) is in third place in the conference 
at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Coach Earnest Riggins had a hand in inspiring the Long Beach team. In 
Thursday's editions of the San Diego Union, Riggins had "guaranteed" a win. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini said only that she was aware of the boast. 
</P>
<P>
The 49er players, however, told the full story. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what got us really going," Shameil Coleman said. "Joan got fired up, 
and when she gets fired up, we can't help getting fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Riggins said his comments were taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Perry's teammate were taken out of their game with an uninspired performance in 
their most important game to date. "Chana was ready to play, but she had no 
supporting cast," Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
She hardly needs support. Perry led all scorers with 33 points and 10 rebounds. 
She is the third-leading scorer in the nation and the fourth-leading rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in a class by herself," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach sputtered in the first half but clamped a smothering full-court 
press in the second that shut down San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected the press," Riggins said. "We didn't think we'd have the that much 
problem with it. We thought our guards would do better." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs relied on a freshman at point guard, 5-foot 4-inch Crystal Lee, and 
an injured shooting guard, Julie Evans. Lee's inexperience was damaging to San 
Diego -- she committed 11 of her team's 22 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
After holding an 8-point lead at the half, the 10th-ranked 49ers poured it on. 
Coleman had the best game of her career, scoring 27 points in 26 minutes. She 
was also the team's leading rebounder with 9. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night of balance for Long Beach. Six players scored in double figures. 
Guard Traci Waites had 16 points, 8 assists and 5 steals. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers didn't have a big lead until the waning minutes, which is 
uncharacteristic of a team that is accustomed to scoring in huge chunks. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get big spurts," Bonvicini said. "We just methodically kept them out 
of the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs got off to a fast start, taking a 10-5 lead not even 3 minutes into 
the game. The 49ers worked their way back and forged as much as a 12-point 
lead. They led, 48-40, at halftime. All of the 49ers were shooting cold, save 
Shameil Coleman. The senior forward scored 12 of Long Beach's first 16 points. 
Coleman led all scorers at the half with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was led by Perry, who had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had 42 rebounds to San Diego's 34 -- the first time in 2 years that 
the Aztecs have been out-rebounded.

HUNTER COMES THROUGH FOR CALGARY IN 7-2 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Calgary Flames expected big things from Mark Hunter when they acquired him 
in a preseason trade, but the veteran wing had not lived up to expectations -- 
until Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter broke a season-long slump with 4 goals at Boston, powering the Flames 
over the Bruins, 7-2, for their 30th win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been 15 games without a goal," said Hunter, who was a 32-goal 
scorer with the St. Louis Blues last season. He had scored just 7 in 36 games 
this season with Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those nights when the puck was bouncing for me, and they kept 
going in." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins completed a string of 4 games without suspended coach Terry O'Reilly 
and went 1-2-1 in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 6, Montreal 4 -- Rookie Jody Hull's power-play goal midway through the 
third period capped a 4-goal flurry in a 5:43 span as the Whalers overcame a 
4-goal deficit to defeat the Canadiens at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The win marked the first time in their 10-year National Hockey League history 
that the Whalers had won a game after trailing by 4 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford, which ended a 3-game losing streak, beat Montreal for the first time 
in 6 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, St. Louis 0 -- Bob Froese recorded his first shutout in 3 
seasons as the Rangers beat the Blues at St. Louis to take undisputed 
possession of first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Rangers' goals was scored by Tony Granato, who has 9 goals and 5 
assists in his last 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Froese, who led the NHL with 5 shutouts in 1985-86 while with the Philadelphia 
Flyers but hadn't posted any since, recorded his 13th career shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 5, New Jersey 4 -- Ken McRae scored his first 2 goals of the season, and 
the Nordiques got 3 goals in the second period to beat the slumping Devils at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Nordiques' second in 3 nights over the Devils, losers of 4 
of their last 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
McRae, who was called up Jan. 16 from Halifax of the American Hockey League, 
took a pass from Marc Fortier and flipped the puck over Devil goaltender Bob 
Sauve's glove at 13:38 of the second period to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Minnesota 3 -- Daniel Marois scored with 1:20 remaining in 
regulation as the Maple Leafs tied the North Stars at Toronto.

THE GREAT GOWN DUST-UP;

<P>
A TANGLED TALE OF DESIGNS FOR THE INAUGURAL DRESSES FINDS THREE HAPPY STUDENTS 
AND AN OCEAN OF SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first fashion flap of the new Administration erupted this week, even before 
the inaugural oaths were read. 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted question of what Marilyn Quayle, wife of the incoming vice 
president, will or will not wear will be answered today when she appears for 
the day's events, from swearing-in through inaugural balls, in the 
just-announced hand-made original designs of three Los Angeles fashion 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy designer Victor Costa, whose dresses she was first reported to have 
chosen, could not be reached for comment. He was in Washington to attend the 
full schedule of festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Heroes of this week's fashion drama are the three students at Los Angeles' 
Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, who were selected last November 
by Mrs. Quayle to design her inaugural clothes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labors in Secret 
</P>
<P>
Denise Ervin, Dan Caudill and Allison Miller have toiled on their historic 
sewing project ever since, without leaking a word to the press. Once the word 
got out Wednesday, the three said: "We were shocked. We're still shocked. We're 
very excited. We're thrilled." They were talking from Washington, where they've 
been holed up at a hotel for a week, putting finishing touches -- and 
re-touches -- on their designs. 
</P>
<P>
Not so heroic, according to the vice-presidential press office, were designer 
Costa and some fashion press, who not only released incorrect news about 
Quayle's choice, but compounded the error by mentioning anything at all about 
Marilyn Quayle's inaugural clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted no mention of Mrs. Quayle's choices until after the 
President-elect's wife announced hers," press aide Barbara Balzano said. "We 
did not want to look as if we're upstaging Barbara Bush, which is something of 
which we've already been accused." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush didn't make it any easier. Apparently in a whimsical mood, she told 
Women's Wear Daily on Monday, "I'm not telling. I don't know why, but I'm not. 
It's just fun not to." (The fashion trade paper nonetheless revealed in that 
same article, that New York designer Arnold Scaasi had designed the gown Mrs. 
Bush would wear to the ball.) 
</P>
<P>
The students got their job because Mrs. Quayle wanted to advance the cause of 
America's student designers, Balzano said. Quayle first contacted the school's 
Washington branch, which doesn't have an advanced program and so forwarded her 
request to the main L.A. campus, where officials selected the three students 
most likely capable of doing the needed work. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think our parents are more excited than we are. My mom cries every 
time I talk to her," said Allison Miller, 24, of Long Beach, who designed 
10-year-old Second Daughter Corinne Quayle's inaugural outfit: a robin's egg 
blue wool dress and cream-color wool coat and beret. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caudill Swearing-In Suit Designer 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Caudill, 22, who lives with his parents in Orange County, designed Mrs. 
Quayle's swearing-in suit. It's of royal blue wool with dropped shoulders, 
intricate seaming, has a matching coat and modified bowler hat. Caudill says 
his school is considering this "a homework project, but it's harder than any 
homework we've ever had." Without their instructor, Hubert Latimer, Caudill 
said, "we might never have gotten through." Latimer is in Washington with the 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Ervin, 32, who designed the inaugural ballgown (but will not describe it 
"because we're waiting for Mrs. Bush to describe hers first") is from Omaha, 
Neb., where she was a costume designer at Omaha Community Playhouse for 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The three students are in the institute's Advanced Study Program, which has 
eleven students this semester and which they describe as being "like a fashion 
graduate school." 
</P>
<P>
The students say that after being selected, they did preliminary sketches and 
assembled fabric swatches while in Los Angeles. Then they flew to Washington on 
about Dec. 7, where they showed their ideas to Mrs. Quayle in her office 
opposite the White House. They saw her again on Dec. 8, when she selected the 
styles and colors she preferred. They then went home to sew, and returned a 
week ago for fittings and alterations. Their final fittings were Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During all this time, Victor Costa was apparently under the mistaken assumption 
that his jade green silk dress with portrait neckline would be worn by Quayle 
to the inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Quayle did come here and make selections," Bob Miller, managing director 
of the Costa firm, said Wednesday. "She selected a color and style of gown in a 
tea length. Then we got a call that that she wanted it full length. Her office 
told us it was needed by a very definite date. It became a much more important 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
"We even went out and bought the beautiful silk satin at retail (prices) 
because we didn't want to order it (wholesale) and take a chance of being 
late." 
</P>
<P>
The dress arrived at Mrs. Quayles's on time; she has paid for it and now owns 
it. Whether it will come out of the closet for any event this weekend, no one 
really knows for sure.

WHAT THE PARADE WILL PASS BY

<P>
When George and Barbara Bush set out from the Capitol in their new $600,000 
armored limousine for today's inaugural march, they'll travel a 
much-transformed Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As they near the parade's end and turn toward the White House, they'll view the 
crown jewel of the avenue's $1.5-billion renovation, the Willard Hotel, the 
once vacant Beaux-Arts hotel that was restored to its original opulence and 
reopened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and a host of other buildings and parks are among the major new 
sights that have swept Pennsylvania Avenue since 1961, when President John F. 
Kennedy rode the boulevard for his inaugural and saw a historic street so 
battered, filthy and dreary that he demanded that it be rebuilt to an image 
befitting America's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken almost 30 years, more than $1.5 billion and the efforts of a 
public agency working with private developers to fulfill Kennedy's demand. 
</P>
<P>
But now, gone are the shuttered shops, saloons and cheap hotels. New parks and 
lights, as well as restorations of historic buildings, have given Pennsylvania 
Avenue a clean, expensive look on the inaugural parade route. When the Bushes 
set out today on that path, stretching from the Capitol to the White House, to 
their right will be the newly completed Meade Plaza, featuring the relocated 
18-foot marble monument to Civil War Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade. 
</P>
<P>
To their left will be the dramatic, angular East Building of the National 
Gallery of Art, designed by architect I. M. Pei. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will continue past the Andrew Mellon Memorial Fountain, whose 
54-foot wide bronze basin is the largest ever cast in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cages of Canaries 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes will zip by John Marshall Park, one of five new park plazas 
completed since the last parade. The park connects the avenue to Judiciary 
Square, where cages of yellow canaries lined the walls of Ulysses S. Grant's 
1873 inaugural ball. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Marshall Park's stair-stepped garden and fountains is the gleaming, new 
Postmodern Canadian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up past 6th Street, the Bushes will ride past two elaborately 
refurbished office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Next they will see Washington's most laughed-at monument. The Temperance 
Fountain, featuring entwined dolphins beneath a water crane, symbolizes the 
superiority of water over demon rum. It was donated to Washington by San 
Francisco dentist Henry Cogswell in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Moving along, the Bushes will pass the Federal Trade Commission and another new 
park, Market Square Park Navy Memorial. The park features a 100-foot-wide disk 
inlaid with a map of the world, fountains and a 7-foot statue titled, "Lone 
Sailor." Military bands give concerts there in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houses U.S. Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, on the south side, will be the sprawling National Archives, 
designed by John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Built in 
the 1930s, its 75-foot-high exhibit hall houses the U.S. Constitution, the 
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
As much as those documents are a part of American history, Pennsylvania Avenue 
has been a key, colorful byway of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Pierre L'Enfant -- hired by George Washington to plot a capital in 
the 10 square miles ceded from Virginia and Maryland -- envisioned Pennsylvania 
Avenue as a sparkling boulevard of foreign embassies with unobstructed, 
breath-taking views between the Capitol at one end and the White House, 14 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
But the avenue evolved differently. During the Civil War, a section of 
Pennsylvania Avenue at 14th Street became the city's red-light district. The 
man selected to care for this area was Gen. Joseph Hooker, who distinguished 
himself to such an extent that ladies of the night became known as hookers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissions Appointed 
</P>
<P>
By the 1930s, the shops and boarding houses began to make way for a wall of 
Neoclassical office buildings. In the 1960s, the avenue was a hodgepodge of 
drab office buildings and run-down stores. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon appointed a series 
of commissions to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But a turning point did not come until 1972, when Congress established the 
Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. to supervise the refurbishing of the 
avenue in tandem with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the agency's major plans have come to fruition since the last inaugural 
parade in 1981. (Ronald Reagan's 1985 parade was canceled because of bitter 
cold weather.) Many feel the street has never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
But amid the beauty of the boulevard, there is also a lingering sadness. On a 
normal day, the homeless roam up and down the street. One man has set up a 
permanent residence of sorts, a configuration of plastic and cardboard, right 
in front of the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House. 
His scrawled sign proclaims him to be a war veteran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless to Be Removed 
</P>
<P>
On parade day, the homeless will be removed from the avenue, though police have 
refused to discuss their plans for how this will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes, on the inaugural march, will pass between the J. Edgar Hoover FBI 
Building on their right and the Department of Justice on their left. The chunky 
FBI Building may not be pretty but it's one of Washington's most intriguing 
tourist attractions, especially the display of the "10 Most Wanted" criminals 
list. 
</P>
<P>
To spruce up the sprawling FBI building's Pennsylvania Avenue facade, the 
development agency is installing panels with eight life-sized figures of George 
Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Abraham 
Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office development, 1001 Pennsylvania Ave., will pop into view 
next. The 785,000-square foot facility includes a central atrium and 
incorporates a number of old architectural facades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saved from Wrecking Ball 
</P>
<P>
On the left is a building that dominates this area of the avenue, the 
Romanesque-style Old Post Office Building, whose soaring observation tower 
brought it the nickname "Old Tooth" and made it the tallest building in 
Washington. Preservation groups had to fight to save it from the wrecking ball 
before an enormous restoration effort turned the building into a shopping 
gallery and 10-story office complex. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the Old Post Office is the Evening Star Building, built 
in Washington's Beaux-Arts style to house the afternoon newspaper. Its finely 
detailed white marble facade is being spruced up as part of a rehabilitation 
project that eventually will contain 212,000 square feet of office and retail 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Another new office complex appears next, across from the massive Federal 
Triangle office building complex. The Bushes then pass yet another park, 
renamed Freedom Plaza in 1988 in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A block 
long, Freedom Plaza is one of the major public spaces on the avenue and is the 
first of three parks spanning the next three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Freedom Plaza, the Bushes can see a brand-new shopping, hotel and 
office complex, and the restored National Theater. Washington's oldest theater, 
it first opened in 1835 and reopened in 1984 after a major face lift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Held Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The next block contains Pershing Park and just beyond it, the dazzling, 
renovated Willard Hotel and Office Building. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln held occasional staff meetings in the Willard lobby. Franklin Pierce, 
Calvin Coolidge and Harry S. Truman all stayed in the hotel, where King wrote 
his "I Have a Dream" speech and where guest Julia Ward Howe wrote the words to 
the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" on hotel stationery. 
</P>
<P>
Howe might have written another battle hymn if she could have looked into a 
crystal ball and seen the coming of the 1989 inaugural prices. The Presidential 
Suite, which has been rented out this week and includes a separate dining room, 
a grand piano, four-poster king size bed and a spa, goes for $2,300 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The parade route then makes a right turn where Pennsylvania is rerouted to jut 
around the White House, passing the giant Treasury Building and Garfinckel's 
Department Store before taking a left back onto Pennsylvania Avenue, now in 
front of the White House grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street will be Lafayette Square, a large park that has become the 
parking spot for protest groups a lunch spot for office workers and home to 
many homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The parade ends just past the White House, and the Bushes then can move into 
their new home.

INAUGURAL EVENTS SHOW MINORITY SUPPORT OF GOP 
</P>

<P>
Mario Castillo surveyed the members of his gala dinner table on Wednesday night 
and grumbled, "I think I'm the only Democrat here." 
</P>
<P>
So why was Castillo, a Washington-based lawyer, attending the Hispanic American 
Inaugural Ball to celebrate the incoming Republican President? "I wanted to see 
what the competition was doing," he said. "And they're doing damn well." 
</P>
<P>
That praise was echoed by Republicans and Democrats at the half a dozen or so 
events this week hosted by minority groups as part of the week's inaugural 
festivities. Besides the galas, blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans and 
Native-American inaugural committees and special-interest groups have planned 
prayer breakfasts, luncheons, receptions and awards presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Heralding the new Administration and President George Bush is just one of the 
priorities at the events, where networking also is an important chore. 
Democrats, independents and even nonpolitical types are attending the inaugural 
events, checking out the competition as well as making those 
once-every-four-years contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering why we lost the election," Castillo said as he picked up a 
program for the Hispanic ball and flipped through the pages. "Now I know. Look 
at these names! They're organizing! The (GOP) went after the upwardly mobile 
Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acceptable Language 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, former staff chief for the House Agriculture Committee, wasn't even 
offended by Bush's campaign reference to his half-Latino grandchildren as the 
"little brown ones." Castillo said he felt Latinos hadn't perceived that remark 
as racist. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a term of endearment," he said. "My mother used to call me 'the little 
black one' because I was darker than my brothers and sisters. What Bush did was 
reach out to the Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said he was worried about the Democratic Party's future. "And I'm not 
even a politician," he said. "My father's a Democrat and he voted for Bush. I 
don't know," he added with a shrug. "These people are in for the long run. But 
we have four years." 
</P>
<P>
As mariachis played on stage in the ballroom of the Washington Hilton on 
Wednesday night, Los Angeles businessman David Lizarraga made his way through 
the crowd of 1,500, shaking hands and talking with friends. This Democrat also 
had praise for the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has appointed two Hispanic cabinet members and that has to be recognized 
and applauded," Lizarraga said, referring to Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos 
and Interior Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan, both of whom were at the gala, 
also attended by the President's son, Jeb Bush, and his wife, Columba. 
</P>
<P>
Of George Bush, Lizarraga said: "He's my President now, and he's going to be a 
do-er President. . . . He's really embracing people all over the country, and 
the fact is, he attracted a great percentage of the Democratic vote." 
</P>
<P>
Although blacks and Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Michael Dukakis in the 
last election, some minority group members in the Republican Party are 
convinced that Democrats will see their party lose its luster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Family Values 
</P>
<P>
"I think (they) are going to see that with the Bush Administration, Democrats 
don't have anything to offer," said Willie Durazo, president of a service 
corporation in San Diego. "The (GOP ideology) is a lot closer to our culture, 
in terms of family, religion, community and taking care of our own." 
</P>
<P>
Ninfa Laurenzo, a Houston restaurateur, added: "I think we have all come of age 
and we have to make a choice. I believe in free enterprise -- I'm a 
businesswoman." 
</P>
<P>
Across town, where the Asian Pacific American Presidential Inaugural Ball was 
under way, 1,000 or so guests dined on traditional buffet food and danced to 
big band music at the Willard-Intercontinental Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a good function for people to network," said Robert Hsueh, a 
Dallas lawyer. "And not just on a domestic level, but international, as well. 
There are foreign business delegations and dignitaries here, people from the 
Republic of China, Korea, Thailand." 
</P>
<P>
The ball offered a rare chance for guests to mingle, chat and polish contacts, 
said Hsueh, who added: "This is a nonpartisan event. There is no strong 
political tone." 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of cabinet appointments was a "touchy" one, noted Hsueh, a member 
of the Asian American Outreach Committee appointed by Bush to scout for 
qualified applicants to serve in the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see he has appointed an outreach committee," Hsueh said of the 
President. And though there have been no Asian-American appointments yet by the 
new Administration, he said he remains "hopeful. It's not that we don't have 
qualified applicants." 
</P>
<P>
At the ballroom entrance, Jeanne Lin, 24, was at the ticket reservation table 
looking over receipts, hoping to make it into the party before it was over. 
</P>
<P>
Lin -- a law school student from Potomac, Md., and a member of the Federation 
of Young Asian American Republicans -- said her interest in politics was 
sparked by her parents. But she noted: "There are not a lot of Asian-Americans, 
especially women, involved in politics. Maybe my generation will change that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Your Way Up 
</P>
<P>
Lin found it easy to see the GOP'S attraction for Asian-Americans. "There are 
many similarities with the Asian ideology," she said. "In my opinion, those who 
come over as immigrants work very hard to earn money and work their way up. And 
my image of the Republican Party is that you make your way up in society, and 
work very hard." 
</P>
<P>
The American Indian Inaugural Committee holds its ball tonight at the 
Washington Plaza Hotel, promising traditional dances as well as a 
Country-Western band for 1,000 guests. 
</P>
<P>
The gala's purpose, said Mitchell Bush, president of the American Indian 
Society, is to "Celebrate the continuing relationship of the American Indian 
with the United States. . . . It's also an opportunity for tribal leaders to 
meet, and for lesser-known tribes to make themselves known." 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Shown Harjo remains "cautiously optimistic" about the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Harjo, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, a 
lobbying group, added, "Certainly the new President is smart and 
issue-oriented. For Indian issues, I think that will bode well because we will 
have a better opportunity to have our issues be given serious consideration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prayer Breakfast 
</P>
<P>
The week's inaugural events began Monday with an ecumenical prayer breakfast in 
celebration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That event was hosted 
by the American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural Afro-American Committee. 
The committee also hosted a business awards luncheon and awards dinner. (Among 
the honorees at the latter event was Myrlie Evers, Los Angeles City Board of 
Public Works commissioner.) 
</P>
<P>
Thaddeus Garrett Jr. is co-chairman of that group, which also sponsors of an 
awards luncheon and dinner this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the prayer breakfast symbolized Bush's intention to be president of 
all the people," said Garrett, president of a Washington-based economic trade 
development consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Why are some of his Democrat friends attending the events? "I think they 
recognize first that we won the election, and second they are responding to 
Bush's open door." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is thrilled with Bush's appointments of blacks to Cabinet and other 
posts. "That's not being done under a Democrat," he said. "Actions speak louder 
than words, and you can't help but receive that as George Bush meaning 
business."

FOCUS ON: . . . DANCE: CHOREOGRAPHER STILL DANCING ON 'SUDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Will success spoil Javier Velasco? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all, not at all," said Velasco, in the wake of his whirlwind brush with 
fame as choreographer of "Suds." 
</P>
<P>
Velasco was tagged to choreograph the '60s-style rock musical for a workshop 
production at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. But it was destined for more. 
When "Suds' " three-week cycle at the Rep expired, the show gained a new lease 
on life as a subscription series production for the Old Globe, garnering rave 
reviews from local critics and the generally staid Globe-goers as well. 
</P>
<P>
That catapulted the home-grown musical revue all the way to New York, and 
thrust its fledgling choreographer into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after choreographing the show with another cast for a Toronto run, Velasco 
is back in San Diego for the second coming of "Suds" at the Rep's Lyceum Stage. 
This "Suds" explosion could be quite a head-turner for a 27-year-old 
choreographer whose credits were limited to college productions and 
apprenticeships before this project. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Velasco says, "I'm a hard person to get excited about things. I wasn't 
thinking about getting good reviews or whether the show would get good reviews. 
We were just some friends working together." 
</P>
<P>
When Velasco started his own dance training at a vocational high school in San 
Diego in 1980, he said had no serious designs on dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated dancing with a passion," he said. "But, when I went for an audition, 
they told me everyone has to dance. The choreographer showed me the movements, 
and I realized I could do that. From that day, I decided I wanted to become a 
dancer." 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, he began playing supporting roles to respected dance makers, 
such as Jack Tygett at USIU and the Wards at Starlight, but "Suds" was his 
first solo assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"Director (Will Roberson) was leery about using me, so he called me in and 
asked me what my choreography would be like," said Velasco. "I told him, 'I 
want the choreography to be clever. If you want the show to be funny, get 
someone else.' He said, 'Fine.' But it turned out funny anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I like redefining the steps and doing them in an offbeat way," Velasco said. 
"The choreography in 'Suds' has a lot to say about the quirkiness of the show. 
It poked fun at the period -- in a loving way. I was the youngest person in the 
group, but from the first rehearsal, they put themselves in my hands. They 
trusted me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his instant success as a choreographer, Velasco still is not optimistic 
about his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trained into obsolescence," he said. "I was trained not as a ballet or 
jazz dancer, but as a musical theater dancer. They don't make those kind of 
musicals any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, my day will come again, and they'll be looking for choreography 
with an individual stamp -- with great dance sections and large dance 
ensembles," he said. "I like teaching, and I've worked with modern dance and 
ballet companies. But that's not really where my heart is. I'm still searching, 
because my heart is in musical comedy. I'm the standard bearer, trying to bring 
it all back." EILEEN SONDAK

<P>
Old age can be a terrifying place. 
</P>
<P>
The betrayals of the body -- the stiffening legs, the rheumy eyes, the wavering 
hands -- all mirror an increasingly hostile environment. It's a world made up 
of a triple threat: those who ignore the very existence of the elderly, the 
street thugs who prey upon their weaknesses and relatives whose suffocating 
kindnesses reduce them to children. 
</P>
<P>
Into this inhospitable world enter odd couple Nat and Midge, characters in Herb 
Gardner's "I'm Not Rappaport" at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre through Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Nat, an 81-year-old Jewish man, and Midge, an 80-year-old black man, share a 
Central Park bench, where they drive each other crazy because their coping 
mechanisms are as different as the cultures they come from. 
</P>
<P>
Midge, a superintendent who knows the score, clings to reality. If people don't 
want to see the old, that's fine. He'll work the night shift and play the 
invisible man. If a street punk threatens to beat him up if he doesn't pay him 
3 bucks to be walked home, fine. He'll pay the toll and say, "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Nat is more from the Blanche du Bois school of thought. He doesn't tell what's 
true so much as what ought to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Is someone trying to take advantage of his friend? He'll pretend to be a lawyer 
with a powerful organization that protects the elderly's rights. Is the punk 
trying to rob him? Like the good Socialist he still is, Nat will gladly give 
the kid half the money he has on him -- $11 -- but he will not let the $3 be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Nat is Blanche, then the world is his Stanley Kowalski, beating him 
down with reality. He may drive the punk off one day. But the kid will be back 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Not Rappaport," a Tony-award winning Broadway hit, toured most of the 
country with stars Judd Hirsch -- who picked up his own Tony for Nat -- and 
Cleavon Little. It skipped San Diego, but the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre is 
presenting the local premiere as its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Don Alan Croll as Nat and Lance Roberts as Midge deliver 
warm and winning performances that promise to grow over the run. 
</P>
<P>
Croll, in particular, is a luminous study in the chiaroscuro of an indomitable 
spirit with a swiftly deteriorating body. His grand schemes gain poignancy from 
their contrast with the age spots on his forehead (kudos to Dianne Holly's 
makeup job), the squint of his eyes, his hands quivering like hummingbird 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, in contrast, could show Midge's age more. He has mastered the role of 
comic foil; now he needs to take more time with the dramatic reactions. What 
James A. Strait's direction needs to emphasize is that Midge, who has the 
slightly smaller part, is nevertheless the all-important truth teller here. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast varies in quality. The best are Allison Brennan as Nat's 
daughter, Clara, and David Wright, as a loan shark known as the Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the characterizations lack force. As Danforth, the tenant in 
Midge's building who comes to the park to fire Midge, Ken Parratt is curiously 
calm and non-reactive when Nat tries to pull one of his cons on him. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest puzzle of the production is why the set, by Robert Earl, goes for a 
two-dimensional Disney-like effect rather than the gritty reality of Nat's and 
Midge's world. Where do these brightly colored, cut-out trees and clear, 
well-lit tunnel come from, anyway? Hey, guys, this is supposed to be New York. 
Where are the graffiti? But its flaws are mere scratches on the real star of 
the show, which is the marvelous script. 
</P>
<P>
For old fans of Gardner's "A Thousand Clowns," the good news is that even the 
despair Gardner attaches to old age has not dimmed his belief in the redemptive 
power of imagination. For those who still hold a place in their hearts for 
crazy Murray, the comedy writer in "A Thousand Clowns" who ditched the 9-to-5 
life in order to enjoy existence, and then returned to the grind because he 
loved his child more than himself, he is back in the person of Nat. 
</P>
<P>
Time can ravage the body. But the heart is the final arbiter of whether we are 
old or young. "I'm Not Rappaport" is a magical tribute to the power of that 
heart. 
</P>
<P>

What is a futures contract? What is a futures margin account? What is hedging? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know the answers to these questions, you are not alone. Futures 
markets are among the most important -- but least understood -- facets of our 
economy. And attention to them has increased sharply in the wake of revelations 
that federal investigators have uncovered massive fraud among brokers at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, two of the nation's 
biggest futures exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a primer on how the futures markets work: 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: What are the commodities markets? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Think of the 12 commodity markets operating in the United States as you 
would the New York or American stock exchanges. However, this is not a place 
where stocks are bought and sold. Instead, the trading is in "futures 
contracts" for a variety of agricultural products -- wheat, corn and pork 
bellies are among the best known -- and financial instruments, such foreign 
currency and Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do these markets exist? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the beginning, the commodity markets were created to protect farmers from 
unexpected and uncontrollable fluctuations in the prices of their crops. These 
days, however, more than just farmers want to protect their positions, and the 
commodities markets have expanded. For example, banks, insurance companies and 
pension funds can protect themselves from interest rate fluctuations by 
participating in futures contracts offered on Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
Typically there are two groups of people who enter into futures contracts: 
speculators and hedgers. Speculators want to profit from fluctuating prices; 
hedgers -- including farmers -- want to protect the market value of their 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is a futures contract? 
</P>
<P>
A: Futures contracts are financial commitments between two parties for the 
delivery of a specified amount of a certain commodity at a specific date in the 
future. The specifics of these contracts are set by the markets on which they 
trade. Contracts generally range in value between $10,000 and $40,000 and can 
reach as high as $1 million, but participants rarely put up the full amount. 
Instead, they make a deposit, typically 10% to 20% of the contract's value. The 
deposit is known as margin, and the account in which this money is held is 
called a margin account. 
</P>
<P>
A key point to remember is that only 3% of the commodities that are the subject 
of these contracts are ever exchanged, notes David Shimko, assistant professor 
of finance at USC. These futures contracts are not about taking possession of a 
commodity; they are about protecting a price position in that commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do these futures contracts work? 
</P>
<P>
A: Let's go back to the farmer. A wheat grower who must get $4 per bushel to 
break even on his crop can be wiped out if an oversupply of wheat at harvest 
drives the market price down to $2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
However, he can protect himself against falling prices by getting into a wheat 
futures contract requiring him to deliver 100,000 bushels of wheat at $4 per 
bushel on a certain date. Although he has no intention of actually selling his 
wheat to the buyer of his futures contract, he has effectively locked in a 
$4-per-bushel return. If the price of wheat drops to $2, he will sell his wheat 
to the mill for the market price, but because of his contract, his loss at the 
mill is offset by his gain on the futures contract. He's a happy farmer. 
</P>
<P>
A speculator, however, who believes that wheat prices are on the rise can make 
money by investing in a $4-per-bushel contract and waiting for the contract to 
rise in value as wheat prices rise. If a drought severely damages a portion of 
the wheat crop and the bushel price of the remaing crop rises to $6, the 
speculator on this contract has scored a big win. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the speculator's winnings are paid by the farmer. Here's how it 
works: The farmer sells his wheat for $6 a bushel at the mill. But his apparent 
$2-per-bushel profit must be used to cash out his original futures contract. By 
the time the dust settles, the farmer gets $4 per bushel and the speculator has 
made a $2 per bushel profit. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can you participate in the futures market? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you're a farmer, your local bank may allow you to sell contracts through 
its hedging service. Speculators -- and this definitely includes the average 
investor -- can get into the market in a variety of ways. Your stockbroker can 
open an account for you in one of the commodity markets; you can invest in a 
commodity futures pool that is similar to a mutual fund; or, if you can meet 
the minimum financial requirements, you can open your own trading account on 
one of the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, you must maintain a cash balance in your account equal to 10% to 20% 
of the value of the contracts in which you've taken a position. It sounds easy, 
but it isn't. The value of the contracts in every trader's account is totaled 
at the end of every trading day, and the accounts are credited and debited by 
the amount the contracts fluctuated during the day's trading. This practice is 
called "marking to market." So if the wheat contract fell one cent per bushel 
and your contract was for 100,000 bushels, your account is debited $1,000 and 
the farmer's account is credited with $1,000. If the deduction causes your 
account to fall below margin requirements, you will be asked to deposit 
additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why are futures so risky? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can lose far more than your original investment. Through margin 
accounts, you only have to put up a small fraction of the total value of the 
contracts you trade. But if the price of the commodity or financial instrument 
declines by a certain amount, you may be subject to a "margin call" requiring 
you to put up more cash to maintain your margin account. 
</P>
<P>
Because of margin, a decline of just a cent in the price of a commodity could 
mean that you lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. If the price falls far 
enough, you could lose your entire initial investment plus additional money you 
invested to maintain your margin account. On the other hand, a rise in price 
could mean you earn far more than you invested. Many investors enter 
commodities with the hope of hitting enough big winners to more than offset 
losses on other trades, but as much as 90% of individual investors lose money 
in the futures market. 
</P>
<P>
Futures also can be risky because prices can move quickly after unpredictable 
events, such as changes in weather conditions. Individual investors generally 
don't have immediate access to such information, putting you at a considerable 
disadvantage to professional traders who can follow and act on events on a 
minute-by-minute basis. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are futures ripe for fraud? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fraud can occur on trading floors when futures brokers manipulate or 
misrepresent prices to customers to pocket part of the profits entitled to 
investors. This practice is central to the current federal investigation of 
trading practices at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Fraud also is rampant when unscrupulous brokers or other salespersons 
misrepresent the riskiness of commodities investments, usually through 
telephone pitches to unsophisticated investors. Earlier this week, for example, 
federal charges were filed against 18 former employees of First Commodity Corp. 
of Boston, alleging that they defrauded more than 2,600 investors of $23 
million. The defendants were charged with using high-pressure sales tactics to 
persuade customers to invest in high-risk commodity ventures that they 
misrepresented as low risk. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are futures regulated? 
</P>
<P>
A: The futures markets are principally regulated by the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission, an independent federal agency that critics contend is more 
lax than the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The various futures exchanges also oversee member brokerage firms that trade on 
those exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
HOW A COMMODITY TRADE IS MADE 
</P>
<P>
1. A customer places an order with a broker. The broker completes an order 
slip. That slip must be stamped showing the exact time the order was received 
from the customer. 
</P>
<P>
2. The broker phones the order to a clerk or other staff person on the floor of 
the exchange where the trade must be executed. The clerk also prepares an order 
slip which must also be time stamped. 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD OPPORTUNITY: The broker never executes the trade, instead pocketing the 
customer's money. This practice, which is rare, is called "bucketing." 
</P>
<P>
3. The clerk takes the order slip to a floor broker in a "pit" where the 
particular commodity or financial instrument is traded. 
</P>
<P>
The floor broker executes the trade through an "open outcry" system of trading. 
In that system, the broker uses hand signals and shouts to communicate his 
trade (whether he wants to buy or sell, how much and what price). Another 
broker or trader willing to make that trade signals or shouts back, and the 
deal is made. 
</P>
<P>
Once the trade is completed, the brokers must record that on their order slips. 
They also must signal to a price reporter at that pit who records the trade and 
in turn reports that to the exchange's clearing operation. The clearing 
operation makes sure that all trades are matched up (each buy order must be 
accompanied by an identical sell order, and vice versa). Trades that are not 
matched up must be reconciled before the next day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD OPPORTUNITY: Brokers and traders may miscommunicate in trading with each 
other, or may err on the terms of their trades. Because these trades still must 
be reconciled through the clearing process, brokers may misrepresent trades to 
customers to avoid eating any losses. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers and traders also may collude with each other to manipulate the price of 
their transaction, allowing them to skim some of the profit entitled to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
4. The floor broker gives the order slip, with information about the completed 
trade, is given back to the clerk who in turn calls the original broker who 
took the customer's order. That broker informs the customer that the trade has 
been completed. The broker also may be required to report the trade to the 
exchange's clearing operation. 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD OPPORTUNITY: The brokers may misrepresent the trade to the customer, 
saying that they sold the commodity at a price of $5 when in fact the trade was 
made at $6. The broker pockets the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also could "replace" the customer's trade with another identical trade 
made for their own accounts at another time of the day that was less 
profitable. The brokers claim the more profitable trade for themselves and sock 
the customer with the less profitable transaction.

JAMES FLANIGAN: FUTURES PITS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Flanigan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So undercover FBI agents, wearing hidden recording devices on the floors of 
Chicago's commodity exchanges, are said to have evidence of traders making 
money improperly at the expense of investors. 
</P>
<P>
That wouldn't surprise anybody who knows the lore of the raucous, old-fashioned 
commodity markets. Commodity speculation is a game where tradition cheerfully 
accepts that 90% of the players lose money and where an old joke of the 
business goes: "What's the quickest way to make a small fortune in commodities? 
Start with a large one!" 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the fact is, not many people are hurt directly. Commodity futures attract 
relatively few individual investors, and commodity investors of any kind, 
corporate or individual, number only in the hundreds of thousands, compared to 
the 30 million Americans who invest in stocks and bonds. More people know 
calculus than know the commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
But the markets are important nonetheless, which is why you're likely to see a 
major federal investigation, followed by reform and tighter regulation from 
Washington. Like so much else, the 150-year old commodity markets of Chicago 
are now an integral part of global finance. 
</P>
<P>
They are where banks and nations hedge their risks on hundreds of billions in 
currency trading, where banks hedge interest rates and investment managers 
hedge stocks and bonds -- not to mention where farmers and grain merchants 
since the 1840s have hedged against price movements in corn, cattle and 
soybeans. "The markets are a risk management facility for the American 
economy," Clayton K. Yeutter, the newly appointed secretary of agriculture and 
a former head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, once said grandly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bets Settled in Cash 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a bank wants to offset its risk on interest rates, it can do so 
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or Chicago Board of Trade by purchasing or 
selling futures contracts on Treasury bills or bonds. The Treasury bill 
contract represents a promise to deliver $1 million worth of T-bills at a 
future time and at a specific interest rate. The June, 1989, contract traded 
the other day, for instance, at an effective interest rate of 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
That means the buyer -- say, a bank hedging its interest rate risk on a loan 
portfolio -- has locked in a rate of 8.2% in June. The seller, perhaps another 
bank, hopes that interest rates decline in the interim, so it can buy T-bills 
on the open market at a lower price to satisfy its obligation to the buyer and 
make a profit on the difference. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind that this is not the stock market, and people aren't buying 
and holding T-bills or corn or wheat. They are betting on the movements of 
prices or interest rates, and so they generally settle their bets in cash. 
</P>
<P>
It is of necessity a fast-moving market, needing lots of betting to keep price 
movements from jumping around wildly. That is why speculators are welcomed -- 
such as the floor traders and brokers, called "locals" in Chicago, among whom 
the FBI reportedly worked undercover. 
</P>
<P>
Also, such a market needs a way to buy and sell contracts at a small fraction, 
or margin, of the face value. Farmers can't put up a crop's full value to hedge 
their risk on a crop; banks can't put up millions to hedge millions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cash deposits on big contracts are marginal. The T-bill contract 
on the Merc can be bought for an $800 deposit (but you have to keep $50,000 in 
cash on deposit with the exchange to qualify as a player). 
</P>
<P>
So an $800 cash bet swings $1 million worth of T-bills, with each 1% movement 
in the T-bill interest rate representing $10,000. And on an average day, more 
than $2 billion worth of T-bill contracts will be traded by floor brokers 
shouting and waving at each other across a pit. 
</P>
<P>
The abuses in such a market are age-old and recognized by veteran players. If a 
trader sees a big order coming from a major bank, say, it is a simple matter to 
step in front of the order, buy for himself and profit as the big order affects 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran commodity investors say there is often a disturbing gap between the 
price at which an order is entered and the price they get. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kind of abuses FBI agents are said to have seen and heard, and 
why reform is coming to the colorful world of fast-talking floor traders. 
</P>
<P>
There are others reasons, too. The traders and their methods are an anachronism 
in a day when computers can efficiently bring together buyers in Tokyo and 
sellers in Milan. The expertise that traders alone supplied is now available on 
a digital network. 
</P>
<P>
So after the inevitable investigation, more automation is sure to come. And the 
markets will be more tightly regulated by Washington. Regulation of commodity 
markets may curb but won't end abuses -- 56 years of securities regulation 
hasn't stopped Wall Street from scheming. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a matter of protecting the franchise. The United States has the 
world's most liquid and proficient capital markets. That's an asset worth 
policing and a reputation worth preserving. Reform is coming to the Chicago 
markets so the world will know that the U.S.A. casino runs a clean game.

AMERICAN SAVINGS LOWERS INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Savings Bank, the successor firm to troubled American Savings &amp; 
Loan, has cut the interest rates it pays on deposits to bring them more into 
line with its large California competitors, the head of the company said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mario J. Antoci, American Savings Bank's new chief executive, said average 
interest rates on deposits have been lowered by two-tenths of a percentage 
point in the last three weeks -- a move that he said led to only a small loss 
in savings even though rates in general were rising. American Savings has $13.2 
billion in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Antoci's moves at American Savings Bank are being followed closely by his 
competitors, especially in the intensely competitive area of deposits. Interest 
on deposits account for most of any thrift's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Applaud It' 
</P>
<P>
Hobbled by deposit outflows sparked by large losses, American Savings &amp; 
Loan often paid high rates for savings because it needed the money to maintain 
its liquidity. That, in turn, angered its rivals, which had to raise their 
rates to meet the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Any step to have a more rational pricing for deposits is a good move and we 
applaud it," Keith Russell, president of Glendale Federal Savings, said. 
</P>
<P>
Antoci's remarks, made to reporters in Los Angeles, are part of his campaign to 
convince the public that American Savings is now a healthy and responsible 
financial institution, free of the financial turmoil that had buffeted the firm 
since 1984. Texas tycoon Robert M. Bass bought the company Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new company," Antoci said. "It's not the old American. . . . That's 
the message I've got to get out." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the sale to Bass, Stockton-based American Savings &amp; Loan was 
divided into two financial institutions in a move that placed the healthy loans 
and stable deposits into a separate company known as American Savings Bank. The 
problem assets and unstable deposits were placed in another thrift known as New 
West Federal Savings, also being run by Antoci. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Modest' Asset Growth 
</P>
<P>
In other remarks, Antoci said: 
</P>
<P>
* American Savings' assets would not grow at all in 1989 and only "modestly" in 
1990. Thereafter, he said, he expects the thrift to grow at a rate of about 8% 
a year. American Savings Bank has about $15.7 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
* The company is looking for a location in Orange County or Los Angeles County 
to consolidate its far-flung Southern California operations. American Savings 
has major offices in Sherman Oaks, Irvine, Fullerton and Whittier. The 
headquarters will stay in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
* American Savings will keep its lending simple, making mostly single-family

million cash in exchange for their 2.8 million shares in Media General after 
Sugarman's unsuccessful takeover attempt of the Richmond, Va.-based newspaper 
publisher and newsprint recycler last spring.

GREAT WESTERN PROFIT RISES

<P>
Great Western Financial said its earnings in 1988 grew 17% to $248 million, 
including $59.7 million earned in the fourth quarter that was more than four 
times what it earned in the last quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western is a financial services firm with $33 billion in assets whose 
operations include Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills, one of the country's 
largest thrifts. Chairman James F. Montgomery said the 1988 results represented 
the second most profitable year in the firm's history. 
</P>
<P>
"These earnings were the result of record loan volume and excellent 
performances in each of the company's four core businesses: real estate 
lending, mortgage banking, retail banking and consumer lending," Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenfed Inc., the parent company of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan, said its net income fell in the second quarter and six months ending Dec.

RECORD QUARTER CLOSES B OF A'S PROFITABLE YEAR

<P>
BankAmerica Corp., capping its first profitable year since 1985, on Thursday 
reported record earnings for the final quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based company -- the nation's third-largest banking 
organization and the parent of Bank of America -- said it earned $265 million 
in the fourth quarter, up more than fourfold from $60 million in the same 
period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive profitable quarter for the company, which once 
appeared to be in turmoil because of troubled loans, primarily to Third World 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly results boosted profit for 1988 to $726 million, in sharp 
contrast with the previous year's $955-million loss, the company's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter profit was increased by last year's agreement between Brazil and 
its creditor banks on a debt restructuring that ended that country's moratorium 
on interest payments. For BankAmerica, the pact brought in back interest 
payments totaling $351 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company also cited increased business, reduced operating expenses and low 
credit losses. 
</P>
<P>
Don Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in San Francisco, said 
the results were better than expected and led him to sharply increase his 
earnings estimate for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you take out all the statistical noise in the numbers," Crowley said, the 
result reflects "a very solid performance" by a bank with more than adequate 
loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts have speculated that BankAmerica, which has not paid a 
dividend since recording its first annual loss in 1985, may reinstate it before 
the company's annual meeting in April. But Chief Financial Officer Frank Newman 
told reporters in San Francisco that he cannot yet say when the dividend will 
be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica common stock closed at $19 a share, up 87.5 cents, in trading 
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Several big New York-based banking companies -- including J. P. Morgan &amp; 
Co., Citicorp and Chase Manhattan -- also reported big gains earlier this week 
attributed in part to the resumption of payments by Brazil, which had suspended 
them from early February, 1987, to the beginning of last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, big banks reported mixed results. Bankers Trust New York 
Corp., the nation's ninth-largest banking group, reported fourth-quarter income 
of $185.5 million, down from $284.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
It blamed the drop on a $309.9-million decline in foreign exchange and other 
trading revenues, which dwarfed its $95-million pretax gain in payments from 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
But Bank of New York, which last year acquired Irving Bank Corp. to become the 
nation's 10th-largest bank organization, said fourth-quarter income rose to 
$54.7 million from $45.9 million.

The Navy has suspended two private defense consultants from any government 
contracting pending the outcome of federal indictments against them in the 
Pentagon fraud scandal, the Defense Department announced. The Navy has barred 
William Parkin, his firm Crest Inc., Fred Lackner and his firm Acris Associates 
from contracting with any federal agency until legal proceedings are resolved, 
the Defense Department said. Parkin and Lackner pleaded innocent last week to 
charges of conspiring with officials of Teledyne Industries and Navy 
procurement official Stuart Berlin to use inside information on procurement

SHAMROCK BOOSTS POLAROID BID, THREATENS PROXY FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamrock Holdings boosted its hostile takeover bid for Polaroid Corp. from $2.4 
billion to $3.1 billion Thursday and vowed to launch a proxy fight to oust the 
company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The move by the Burbank investment company -- which is owned by the family of 
Roy Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney -- surprised stock traders and 
analysts. It revived what appeared to be a stalled takeover attempt for 
Polaroid, the instant photography company based in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the new offer puts pressure on Polaroid to counter with a 
defensive move, such as selling a minority stake or promising shareholders part 
of the money it expects to get this year from winning a patent infringement 
case against Eastman Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
"It caught Polaroid with their heads low. They had to go into a huddle this 
morning," said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with the Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of a proxy fight at Polaroid's annual meeting, scheduled for May 9 
in Wellesley, Mass., adds a key twist to the six-month-old battle because 
Polaroid lacks a staggered board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
A staggered board is a defensive shield used by most large companies to prevent 
a majority of directors from being swept out by dissident shareholders at any 
one time. Typically, about one-third of a company's directors on a staggered 
board face election each year. 
</P>
<P>
All 12 of Polaroid's directors, including 10 outside board members, face 
election in May. To replace them, Shamrock needs the support of only a simple 
majority of the shares voted at the meeting. Shamrock said its nominees to the 
board will be committed to selling Polaroid, either to Shamrock or a higher 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid's only comment was that its directors will review the offer and advise 
shareholders later. Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold said the offer was 
raised and the proxy fight threatened because Polaroid's directors have 
steadfastly spurned Shamrock's bids. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still enough of a Pollyanna in me to believe the outside directors 
will believe this is a reasonable offer. They ought to call me up, invite me in 
and see if we can work out something," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock's bid is being raised $5 a share. The company, which already owns 4.9 
million Polaroid shares, is offering $45 each for the shares it doesn't own, 
including 9.7 million disputed shares held by a Polaroid employee stock plan. 
Shamrock contends that Polaroid placed the shares in the stock plan illegally 
last year as an anti-takeover move. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Delaware Chancery judge upheld Polaroid's stock plan, a decision 
Shamrock is appealing to the Delaware Supreme Court. Under its new bid, 
Shamrock said, the offer will be raised to $47 a share if it succeeds in having 
the 9.7 million shares ruled invalid. 
</P>
<P>
In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Polaroid rose $3.125 a share to 
$39.875. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock said it expects $1.61 billion of the money it needs to come from 
banks, with $1.4 billion coming from the investment banking firms Drexel 
Burnham Lambert and Wertheim Schroder and a partnership that Shamrock formed 
called Emerald Isle.

Adolph Coors Co. said it would abandon the "Original Draft" label it began 
putting on its flagship beer seven months ago, saying too many customers 
thought the brew's ingredients had been changed. New labels on cans and bottles 
that will reach store shelves in three weeks will simply say "Coors," said Mike 
Marranzino, brand director for the brewer, which has its headquarters in 
Golden, Colo., west of Denver.

JAPAN PLANS 6.6% INCREASE IN '89 BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Finance Ministry unveiled Thursday a $483-billion draft budget for fiscal 
1989, offering few major surprises in a document that would moderately boost 
defense spending and foreign aid and make progress toward phasing out 
deficit-financing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal recommends a 6.6% increase over last year's general account 
budget, the largest increase in eight years. Having been endorsed Thursday by 
the Cabinet, it will be subject to haggling by various government agencies 
before formal Cabinet approval Tuesday. The budget will then be put to a vote 
in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry recommended increasing outlays for foreign aid by 5.9%, to 
$6 billion, in keeping with Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's pledge to channel 
$50 billion into development assistance over five years. 
</P>
<P>
That amount is expected to increase slightly after negotiations with the 
Foreign Ministry. Once "soft" loans from the government's fiscal investment 
program are taken into account, the total amount of Japan's foreign aid in the 
fiscal year beginning April 1 should exceed $10 billion, said Hideichiro 
Hamanaka, director of research in the ministry's Budget Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Japan budgeted more for foreign aid than the United States for the first time 
in fiscal 1988. It is not yet certain whether Japan overtook the United States 
as the world's top donor, however, because final figures on disbursements are 
not known. Estimates are that it spent about $10 billion, compared to $8.8 
billion in U.S. foreign aid in the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense spending would be raised in the new budget to $31.1 billion, a 5.2% 
increase identical to that of the past two years. The Defense Agency had 
requested a 6.13% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming economic growth of 4% for the year, as the government now forecasts, 
the 5.2% increase would represent 0.999% of Japan's estimated gross national 
product, and would barely squeeze under the de facto defense spending cap of 1% 
of the GNP. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the proposed defense budget was a 16% increase in the amount the 
government pays for "burden sharing," or support of U.S. troops stationed in 
Japan under a mutual security pact. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that economic expansion will bring a 13.1% rise in tax revenue, 
the Finance Ministry moved to cut the fiscal deficit to $56.9 billion, or 
11.8%, of total expenditures. That would be the lowest rate in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction keeps the government on its timetable of phasing out the issuance 
of deficit-financing bonds after fiscal 1990, Hamanaka said. Heavy deficit 
spending in recent years has left Japan strapped, with a burdensome 
debt-service ratio of 19.3% of its general account total. 
</P>
<P>
Public works spending remained flat, but the normally parsimonious Finance 
Ministry appropriated $54.4 million for the construction of two new shinkansen, 
or "bullet train" lines, widely believed to be political pork-barrel projects.

MICRO D AGREES TO BE ACQUIRED BY INGRAM INDUSTRIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Micro D Inc., the nation's largest wholesaler of personal computer products, 
agreed Thursday to be acquired by its majority shareholder, Ingram Industries 
of Nashville, Tenn., in a $43.9-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after Ingram boosted its cash tender offer for the 41% of 
Micro D it doesn't already own from $12.50 a share, or $37 million, to $14.75 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram first proposed a buyout to Micro D management on Dec. 14, but Micro D 
rejected the $12.50-a-share offer as inadequate. Ingram responded by taking the 
same offer directly to shareholders last week. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Ingram Industries' president, E. Bronson Ingram, said the company 
would not increase its offer because its financial review indicated that Micro 
D was unlikely to achieve its projected sales growth for 1989. Company 
officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Headquarters in Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Ingram said last week that it intends to merge Micro D with Ingram Computers, 
its computer products distribution subsidiary based in Buffalo, N.Y. Micro D 
Chief Financial Officer Godfred P. Otuteye said the merged company would have 
its headquarters in Santa Ana, where Micro D already is based. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Ingram "has expressed its desire to keep the current management in 
place" but that no final decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D sales are expected to top $525 million in 1988.

CHARGES ADDED IN NEWPORT SECURITIES CASE

<P>
Federal prosecutors filed a new racketeering indictment in the 
Princeton/Newport Partners securities fraud case, increasing the number of 
felony counts to 68 from 35 and adding charges that the firm's top executives 
engaged in illegal trading through the U.S. unit of a British investment house. 
</P>
<P>
The five officials of Princeton/Newport, a small securities firm with offices 
in Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, were first indicted in August. The firm 
has since gone out of business, citing the pending racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
The case centers on an alleged scheme by the five to generate illegal tax 
losses through phony stock trades. Much of the allegedly illegal trading took 
place in transactions with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But the new indictment 
also charges that the officials made similar trades through S. G. Warburg, Rowe 
&amp; Pitman, Akroyd Securities Inc., a subsidiary of London-based S. G. 
Warburg Group. The Warburg unit isn't charged with any crimes in the indictment 
but is listed as a "co-conspirator." 
</P>
<P>
The case has received wide attention because it is the first time the U.S. 
attorney's office in New York has used the racketeering statute against the 
principal owners of a securities firm. The law, the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, allows prosecutors to freeze assets pending 
a trial and provides for strict penalties if defendants are convicted, 
including forfeiture of assets and lengthy prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
A new indictment had been expected for some time. A trial is scheduled for June 
5. The new indictment also adds charges related to the filing of allegedly 
false tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The indicted Princeton/Newport officials are James S. Regan, Jack Z. 
Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki, Paul A. Berkman and Steven B. Smotrich. As in 
the original indictment, the one filed Thursday also names a former Drexel 
trader, Bruce L. Newberg, as a defendant.

In Act II of Mozart's "Die Zauberflote," a dejected Papageno contemplates 
suicide because he feels that without the woman he loves, his world will 
crumble. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Opera's Papageno had the entire Orange County Performing Arts 
Center audience momentarily convinced that was exactly what was happening when 
a 5.0 earthquake struck Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Right in the middle of the suicide solo -- what a way to go!" a slightly 
shaken Stephen Dickson said after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought people were moving sets backstage. Then I thought it was an 
airplane flying very close to the building. Actually, earthquake never entered 
my mind. . . . In this case, ignorance is bliss." 
</P>
<P>
Audible gasps and chatter rippled through Segerstrom Hall as people realized 
that the rumbling was a quake, not a special effect. Everyone remained in their 
seats until the temblor subsided. 
</P>
<P>
When the building began to shake at about 10:55 p.m., Dickson was singing 
Papageno's baritone solo in which the comic bird-catcher decides to hang 
himself because he has been separated from Papagena, the woman he loves. He 
postpones a decision, pleading with the audience to talk him out of it. As he 
waited for a response, the hall began shaking and audience members whispered 
and nervously checked with neighbors to verify that it was an earthquake. There 
was no break in the music, and after the disturbance ended, Papageno sang his 
next line in German: "All is quiet." 
</P>
<P>
After the performance, center president Thomas R. Kendrick said no damage to 
the center was reported. He said the building was designed to withstand 
earthquakes: "This is a rugged building. . . . The worse that could happen is 
that the house lights would go on and the standby systems would activate."

Near the epicenter of the quake, The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu reported no 
damage from Wednesday's temblor. "Objects are installed to mitigate effects of 
an earthquake," a museum spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptures and decorative objects are secured to pedestals and tables, and the 
bases of sculptures are equipped with ball bearings, a movable system similar 
to that employed in the foundation of earthquake-proof buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The "Kouros," the Greek figure that is one of the museum's major pieces, is 
held together under spring tension, a new technique, that allows the statue to 
flex rather than jolt under the force of a temblor. Broken in seven pieces, the 
statue, thought to be damaged during a quake in antiquity, is threaded with 
springs rather than the usual method of using metal posts. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 engineering study found that the museum could withstand a 6.5 quake on 
the Malibu-Santa Monica fault, likely to cause the most damage in the vicinity, 
with no structural damage. ELIZABETH VENANT

A survey of movie houses and major film distributors showed that no mishaps 
interrupted filmgoers, with theater personnel reporting nothing out of the 
usual during the quake. Chains such as Mann, Laemmle, Cineplex and AMC had no 
reports of power outages in any of their theaters. SHAUNA SNOW

The whole lotta shakin' did little to interfere with the whole lotta shakin' on 
the local rock concert scene. In West Hollywood, Curt Kirkwood of the 
Phoenix-based Meat Puppets was resting in the Roxy dressing room between the 
band's two shows Wednesday and hardly noticed the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"(Opening band) Pygmy Love Circus had just done its sound check," Kirkwood said 
Thursday. "Then someone said, 'Did you feel that?' I said I just thought it was 
the kick drum. . . . I always think I feel earthquakes (in Los Angeles) 
though." 
</P>
<P>
But Wally Ross, publicist for the band's label, SST Records, had a different 
suggestion: "It was the Meat Puppets that caused the earthquake."

"You could hear and feel the rumble moving from stage left to stage right" at 
the Shubert Theatre in Century City, said "Les Miserables" stage manager Scott 
Faris. "The turntable sounded like a drum." 
</P>
<P>
Reece Holland, who plays Marius, was singing "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables." 
The quake emptied a few of the chairs in the auditorium, as several people 
headed for the exits. But Holland kept singing, and even steadied the nearby 
chair and table with his hand. He got a rousing ovation as soon as the tremor 
stopped -- before his number was completed, said Faris, "and the applause 
continued well into the next scene." 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that went through my mind was to sing louder," Holland said. 
"It was one of the scariest things in my life, but it'll make a good story to 
tell Johnny Carson." Meanwhile, two of the actors who play ghosts of the 
revolutionaries, in a lineup behind Holland, ran off stage. They were two of 
the Californians in the company, said Faris, who also reported that "the follow 
spot operators, suspended over the auditorium, were scared to death." DON

5 CHILDREN AND MOTHER RESCUED;

TRAIN HIT CAR SECONDS LATER

A Santa Fe Railroad worker pulled a young mother and five screaming children 
from a stranded car seconds before a passenger train struck it at a Buena Park 
railroad crossing Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad man fell during the rescue of the last child and injured his right 
shoulder. Otherwise, no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Police, a witness and railroad officials called the rescue "heroic" and 
"breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving the kids to school," said Lorraine Ruiz, a 26-year-old single 
parent. "I also had along my niece and nephews -- my sister's children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lives in Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz lives on Franklin Street in northern Buena Park with her two children, 
Vincent, 5, and Justine, 3. Thursday morning she had her niece, Candice, 8, and 
two nephews, Adam, 7, and Andrew, 2, in her car. 
</P>
<P>
"I take care of Justine and Andrew in my home, and I was driving the others to 
Emery School," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving (east) down Artesia (Boulevard), and there was a red light at 
the stop signal at Artesia and Dale (Street). I stopped at the red light on 
Artesia, and while I was stopped I heard a train go by. I heard the 'ding, 
ding' of the railroad crossing (barrier going back up), and when the signal at 
the intersection turned green, I made a left turn onto Dale and drove (north) 
across the railroad tracks." 
</P>
<P>
But Ruiz was caught off guard when a second train approached the crossing as 
she drove her 1967 Chevrolet across it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of the crossing when I heard the 'ding, ding' again and 
saw the barrier going down. The barrier behind me went down on the trunk of the 
car. I thought I'd back up, but I couldn't back up. I had the car in neutral. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked to the right, and there was a train coming. You know, it was like a 
blur. I was thinking, 'This is like a scene from a movie I saw.' It was a 
blur." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Otero, 44, of Anaheim, a Santa Fe Railroad worker for 18 years, was in a 
Santa Fe truck near the railroad crossing. He and Tony Moralez, 32, of 
Hesperia, a track supervisor, were waiting to make a routine inspection of 
tracks in the area. Otero said he saw Ruiz drive her car to the middle of the 
Dale Street crossing, then stop when the barrier signal started going down in 
front of her. 
</P>
<P>
"An Amtrak eastbound train had first gone by, just before she drove up, and the 
barrier was going down this time for a westbound Amtrak," Otero said. "There 
was nothing in front of her to stop her. The gate was going down in the other 
lane; the oncoming traffic. All she had to do was keep on driving forward. 
</P>
<P>
"But she stopped. I saw she wasn't moving at all. She tried to go in reverse, 
but by that time the gate had already come down on the trunk of her car. Tony 
said to me, 'Joe, go see what you can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said she was probably confused at this point. The five children in the car 
heard the oncoming train and started screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go backward, but I couldn't," she said. "The motor was still on, 
and the car was in neutral. I turned to the children in the back seat and said, 
'A train is coming! Climb up to the front seat! Hurry! 
</P>
<P>
"And then, right in front of me, a man was there. He was yelling at me, 'Go! 
go!' It was confusing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put It in Drive and Go!' 
</P>
<P>
Otero said: "I ran over there and said, 'Lady, put it in drive and go!' The 
train was still far enough away that she could have done that. But I don't know 
why she didn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
"She was scared. She was confused. The kids were screaming. And by that time 
the train was really coming; it was coming toward the car at about 50 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said: "This man by the car then started yelling at me, 'Get out of the 
car, the train is coming!' So I opened the door. I didn't panic. I started 
lifting the children out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Otero helped the children climb out. "I told them and their mother, 'Run!' 
because I knew what would happen with the impact," he said. "I knew it would 
send debris all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed the last little one -- he's only about 2 or 3 years old -- and I 
started running. I slipped on the grass and fell, and since I didn't want to 
fall on the little kid, I turned to my right and fell on that shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escaped Flying Bits of Metal 
</P>
<P>
In the truck, Moralez watched the rescue unfold as the train surged forward. He 
said the train crashed into the car at about the time that Otero fell to the 
ground. Fortunately Otero, the mother and the children were all far enough away 
from the impact to escape flying bits of metal and glass, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe says he had about 10 seconds from the time he got the last kid out, but 
personally I think it was less than that," Moralez said. "All of this was 
happening in just a few seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Otero and Moralez comforted the crying mother and the children at the scene. 
Otero got a ride for the older children so they could continue to school. 
</P>
<P>
"Candice is the only one who was really upset after it was all over," Ruiz 
said. "The principal at her school gave her some help and counseling. The other 
children all seem OK. As for me, I can't talk about it hardly without crying. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really thankful for that man (Otero), because without him, I would have 
never been able to get all those kids out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crash Totaled Car 
</P>
<P>
"The car is totaled. And it's sad, because I worked hard to buy that car. I 
haven't had a job in about a year and a half because I have no baby-sitters, 
and I have to take care of the younger ones. I used to be a counseling 
assistant at Fullerton College. I don't know what I'm going to do without my 
car." 
</P>
<P>
Otero said: "She was crying about the car after it was all over, and I told 
her, 'Lady, you can always get another car. Just be glad you and the children 
are alive.' That's what is important." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Fullerton railroad depot Thursday afternoon, Santa 
Fe Railroad officials proudly applauded Otero's heroism. 
</P>
<P>
"The railroad's director of safety said it sounds like he (Otero) would be a 
good nominee for the Carnegie medal" for heroism, said Mike Martin, Santa Fe's 
manager of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hero Downplays Role 
</P>
<P>
Otero was treated at St. Jude Hospital &amp; Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton 
for an injured right shoulder. At the press conference, he modestly downplayed 
his role on the railroad tracks that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I have eight children of my own," he said. "There were others there at the 
crossing, and they weren't doing anything, so I thought I better do something 
to help. No, I wasn't concerned for my safety, because the main thing was 
getting them out. I just wanted to do something. I couldn't just stand there 
and watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just doing what I would hope anyone would do if my family was in such a 
situation."

AIRPORT CONTRACTORS THREATEN WALKOUT, CITE NON-PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Claiming that they have not been paid in months, several subcontractors 
involved in construction of the new John Wayne Airport passenger terminal 
threatened Thursday to walk off their jobs, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Murphy, the county's airport project director, said that he immediately 
asked Taylor Woodrow Construction California Ltd., the prime contractor on the 
terminal project, to account for $6.2 million that the county has already paid 
it. Murphy said he expects a reply today or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Taylor Woodrow, which is based in New York but has offices in 
Irvine, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractors' threats are only the latest in a series of problems that 
the terminal project has encountered -- problems that began when the original 
prime contractors' bids came in much higher than expected. In recent months, 
there has been speculation that the terminal's opening date of April 1, 1990, 
may be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one of the subcontractors on the terminal project said that about 
six firms claim they have completed substantial portions of their work but have 
received no money or very little money for periods going back as far as August. 
Other subcontractors said the dispute may involve as many 10 or more firms, 
some of which are owed money on additional work that they were asked to perform 
beyond that required by their original contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only put out a certain amount of dollars for only so long before you 
run into trouble if you don't get paid," said Jack Garoutte, vice president of 
Rebar Engineering Inc., one of the subcontractors involved in the dispute. 
"Some companies may not be able to continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
Rebar has a $900,000 contract to supply reinforcing steel for the terminal 
project. Garoutte said his firm has performed about two-thirds of its assigned 
work and has been owed $400,000 since the end of November. Another $118,000 is 
owing for December but is not yet overdue, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting two different stories -- one from Taylor Woodrow and one from 
the county," Garoutte said. "Taylor Woodrow says it hasn't been paid by the 
county, but the county says that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
The terminal project is part of a $300-million airport expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Begley, project manager for HPV, a consulting firm that is overseeing 
the expansion, said that he personally expedited delivery of a payment of 
county money to Taylor Woodrow recently to ensure that a particular 
subcontractor was paid. But he said he later learned that the subcontractor had 
not received the money. 
</P>
<P>
"We're investigating the situation to see what happened," Begley said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Luera, president of Avance Engineering Co., a Covina-based excavation 
firm, said that Taylor Woodrow owes his company $250,000 and that Avance has 
not been paid for 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
"All indications," Luera said, "are that we won't be paid on it for another 3 
or 4 months. . . . One subcontractor has been finished for a long time and 
hasn't been paid since September." 
</P>
<P>
Luera said Murphy had asked him and other subcontractors Thursday to give him 
information about the alleged non-payments. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing that, and we hope this gets resolved right away," Luera said. 
"We're fairly small. . . . As far as I know we're the only minority contractor 
out there, and we're fairly new. This is what puts small companies out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Luera said his firm has worked for Taylor Woodrow on other projects and had no 
trouble getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
The terminal project has been controversial from the beginning, when all the 
bids for the job of prime contractor came in $19 million to $20 million above 
the $40 million that the county had budgeted for it. That led to a major 
redesign of the project to cut costs by $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have charged that the county should have called for new bids 
rather than accepting the low bid and then ordering cutbacks. But airport 
manager George Rebella has argued that the county could not afford to delay 
construction because income from airlines using the new facility is needed by 
April 1 of next year to start repaying the bonds sold to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
Others believe that the team of architects who designed the terminal relied on 
grossly inaccurate cost estimates for construction materials, especially steel. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Rebella said Thursday they are confident that the subcontractors' 
complaints will not delay the terminal's completion. "They wanted a meeting 
next week," Murphy said, "but I felt it was important to get on this today so 
the matter can be resolved right away."

PLANNING COMMISSION NOMINATION MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Nordeck, a former mayor of Manhattan Beach who owns the Trabuco Oaks 
Steak House in Trabuco Canyon, was nominated to the County Planning Commission 
Thursday by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve Nordeck comes to the position with significant experience in land-use 
matters and familiarity with the public policy," Vasquez said in a statement. 
"A former mayor, councilman and school board president, he is skilled in 
receiving public input and reviewing technical data." 
</P>
<P>
Nordeck's nomination will go to the Board of Supervisors for formal approval on 
Jan. 24. He will replace George Osborne, who has been on the commission since 
January, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne, a former director of the county Environmental Management Agency, was 
recently appointed by the city of Fullerton to the County Water District Board 
of Directors. He said he was resigning from the Planning Commission to focus 
his attention on water problems. 
</P>

BUSH BACKERS CAUGHT UP IN INAUGURAL WHIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some are along for the first time and not even sure which events they will 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Others are veterans of this sort of thing, and their itineraries are planned 
down to the minute. 
</P>
<P>
Most had to know at least one influential person to be invited. 
</P>
<P>
Others hope to meet a lot of influential people by the time it is all over. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a good bet that all of them have one thing in common: They have been 
solid backers of George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County contingent in Washington for today's inauguration of George 
Bush as 41st President of the United States numbers in the hundreds. And for 
just about every one of them, it promises to be the celebration of the year. 
(Except, perhaps, for those who slip away to Florida on Sunday for the Super 
Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
Those with invitations and tickets will be part of an intimate gathering of 
more than 100,000 at numerous festivities revolving around the outdoor 
inauguration ceremony and parade -- outdoors, that is, if the weather permits. 
</P>
<P>
At Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1985, recalled Orange County Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, "we lost the parade" and the swearing-in ceremony was moved 
indoors because of bitter cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to the parade . . . this year," said Wieder, who arrived 
in Washington on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach labor relations attorney Roger H. Schnapp vividly recalls just 
how cold it was at the last presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Schnapp and his wife, Candice, accompanied friends from Texas to the 
Inaugural Gala. Their friends provided the limousine and driver, who 
unfortunately was not very well acquainted with Washington streets. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping off his passengers, the driver never found his way back to pick 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
The stranded couples, resplendent in long dresses and black ties, finally found 
their way to a subway station for the return trip to their hotel, said Schnapp, 
who arrived in Washington on Tuesday night intending to use a local driver this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third inaugural I've been to with my wife, and I was to the first 
(Richard M.) Nixon inauguration," Schnapp said. "The . . . tickets have been 
far harder to get to this one. People are coming to this one from all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"There seem to be more events, not necessarily formal inaugural events. There 
are more events geared toward families and children." 
</P>
<P>
"And there are probably more non-official events going on," said Schnapp, whose 
invitations to various functions came "from a variety of different sources," 
including congressmen with whom he deals on behalf of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We generally spend a little time up on the Hill, but it's a social event. It's 
nice to see them (congressmen) when you're not asking for something or trying 
to persuade them to vote on a bill," Schnapp said. "The longer you're active in 
politics, the more friends you make, so it's more fun to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Candice Schnapp met former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) at one inaugural 
when she stepped backward in an elevator and landed squarely on the one-time 
presidential candidate's foot. 
</P>
<P>
"She was horrified," Schnapp recalled. "He was very, very gracious, (saying) 
'Don't worry about it, darling.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in Washington this week is a politician like Wieder or even a 
hobnobber with politicians like Schnapp. Some are politically smaller fries. 
</P>
<P>
"Like so many other people have said, it'll be a really fun trip and a great 
experience, and I think it will benefit me when I come back to the county in 
further endeavors," said Richard Schroeder, 20, president of Republican Youth 
Associates of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
When Schroeder left his classes Tuesday at UCLA, where he is majoring in 
economics, he was uncertain exactly how he would spend his time during the rest 
of the 5-day celebration in Washington that began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding is that we will be doing some work at some events just 
helping people find their seats or taking tickets at the door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In that way, Schroeder and Rhonda Carmony, 18, a clothing store cashier and 
vice president of Republican Youth Associates of Orange County, will be on hand 
for many of the inaugural activities. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine is head of credentials for the Inaugural Committee," Carmony 
said. "He got the tickets. Hopefully, I have enough for all my friends. He told 
me he'd get me a ticket to everything, and I'm just betting on that." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who has been a Republican "as long as I can remember," and Carmony, 
who has been a Republican "ever since I was old enough to know better," both 
attended the Republican national convention last summer in New Orleans to see 
Bush's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a great experience," Schroeder said of the inaugural 
celebration. "One thing I learned in New Orleans is that you meet a lot of 
people. It's really good for meeting people and to basically become more active 
in the party and do bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he might like to hold public office himself, but "later in life, 
like when I'm 35 or 40." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach psychiatrist Bob Amstadter ranks the inaugural activities "among 
the healthiest priorities" for himself and his family, according to his wife, 
Barbara, who is president of a real estate sales firm. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is a psychiatrist," she explained. "My husband is also a rabid 
Republican. "I'm so excited I can't tell you. It's just a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I have an 8-year-old son who thinks he is going to meet George 
Bush. He's told every kid at school he is going to shake George Bush's hand. I 
hope he is not disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, who no doubt has shaken the hand of George Bush, was a bit disappointed 
at the first inauguration she attended. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we were starry-eyed and bushy-tailed," she recalled. "We had our 
ball tickets stolen out of our envelope. When we picked them up, it was an 
empty envelope." 
</P>
<P>
Attending her third inauguration this year, Wieder said she has since learned 
"how to fight for our tickets." 
</P>
<P>
This time, "everything is in hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"What is so exciting is that this is turning out to be a bigger turnout than 
the previous Reagan inaugurations," she said. "Seeing the curtain rise on 
another Administration gives you a feel for the direction in which this country 
could be going." 
</P>
<P>
It gives Don Hallman a patriotic chill. 
</P>
<P>
"Just going back there is kind of a patriotic thing," said the 26-year-old 
field representative for Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). "It's a 
200-year-old tradition. I think it's something I am going to remember for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
For Everett Kaplan, the arrival of this momentous event meant aging overnight. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Kaplan was 15 years old. After one high-speed day of formal 
functions in Washington, he awoke Wednesday morning 16 years old. OK, so it was 
his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he was on a rigorous schedule. By midday Wednesday, Kaplan, a Newport 
Harbor High School junior, had attended a breakfast meeting and an orientation, 
visited the House of Representatives, listened to a speech by Congress' 
youngest member, had lunch at the Air and Space Museum, visited a Japanese 
exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution and was preparing to attend a black-tie 
affair at the Kennedy Center for the Arts. And the inauguration was still 2 
days away. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan is one of about 500 high school students from around the nation in 
Washington as part of the 1989 Youth Inaugural Conference sponsored by the 
Congressional Youth Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the pomp and circumstance, for Kaplan "the most interesting thing 
. . . is I met a girl from Germany in the Air and Space Museum. We got to 
talking about high school and the differences between her and me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping in the summer to spend some time abroad." 
</P>
<P>
But for most, the pomp and circumstance holds center stage. Has all this hoopla 
grown out of proportion? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's quite appropriate," said 17-year-old Juan Carlos Zarate, student 
body president of Santa Ana's Mater Dei High School. 
</P>
<P>
"The sense of history you get . . . engenders in me, at least, a real pride in 
America."

WEEKEND CLOUDS LIKELY BUT RAIN IS DOUBTFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's taste of summerlike weather should last through today, 
the forecasters said Thursday, but temperatures probably will drop a bit when 
clouds move in on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Predictions of possible rain on Sunday, however, were growing more faint. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like only a slight chance of precipitation," said meteorologist Dave 
Beusterien of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
With a high-pressure area over Utah pushing inland winds down the hillsides, 
Santa Ana temperature readings again resembled those of early July. Thursday's 
high was 79 degrees after an overnight low of 47. 
</P>
<P>
Relative humidity ranged from 45% to 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Beusterien said the temperature should be in the upper 70s today and possibly 
as high as 80, dropping to the mid-70s Saturday and the mid-60s Sunday, when 
light winds off the ocean should bring cloudiness. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said there might be some variable high cloudiness 
today and Saturday with fog along the coast by Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty north-to-northwest, 15-to-20-m.p.h. winds below the canyons should begin 
decreasing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches, which have attracted plenty of swimmers, sunbathers and surfers 
during the pleasant weather of the past couple of days, are expected to have 
3-foot surf today and Saturday from Santa Barbara to San Diego.

OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON SHRUB REMOVAL: IS IT A DIG AT THE HOMELESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Santa Ana city officials said shrubs and trees were uprooted as part the 
maintenance plan for the Civic Center Plaza, but critics say the action is just 
another effort to make life more inconvenient for the city's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Citing an earlier city policy of discarding the possessions of the homeless 
stashed behind the same shrubbery, Robert Cohen, director of the Orange County 
Legal Aid Society, said he sees the new action as "part of the package of 
dealing with the homeless as a negative instead of dealing with them as people 
who have problems." 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like an incredible coincidence," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Doby, the city's recreation director, said the landscaping changes were 
part of the city's annual maintenance plan and had nothing to do with the 
homeless. "Our consideration is revamping the area every 5 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Doby said the junipers and other shrubs, which often are used as shelter by the 
homeless, were uprooted from around Civic Center buildings as part of the 
revamping and to redo the irrigation system. The older shrubbery is being 
replaced with flower beds that are more colorful and require less maintenance, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Legal Aid Society sued the city on behalf of two homeless men 
to discontinue a policy of discarding the bedrolls of the homeless. As a 
result, the city now stores found bedrolls at Centennial Park, where they may 
be claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Doby said city workers send any bedrolls or personal items that are labeled 
with names to the park, which is about 4 miles from the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
But Cohen said Thursday that the homeless are only allowed to claim their 
belongings 2 hours each week on Tuesdays and Fridays. He said the Legal Aid 
Society filed an amended complaint to the original lawsuit over the access 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems they've gone out of their way to make things inconvenient for the 
homeless," Cohen said. "You wonder what they're going to do next."

L.A. GANG MEMBER ACQUITTED BY JURY IN SANTA ANA SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles gang member who was implicated in a double slaying in the streets 
of Santa Ana more than 4 years ago was found not guilty of murder on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury in Santa Ana, after deliberating almost a week, acquitted 
Frank W. Halstead, 22, of Echo Park of all the charges against him -- murder, 
attempted murder and conspiracy. He could have faced a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Look at the Evidence' 
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy!" Halstead shouted in a telephone interview after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad that the jury was willing to look at the evidence and not let 
the fact that gangs were involved taint them into distorting the facts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Halstead, the driver of a car filled with Los Angeles Diamond Street gang 
members one night in September, 1984, was accused of pulling out a handgun and 
giving it to a passenger during a confrontation with a group of Santa Ana gang 
members in the 2000 block of West 5th Street in Santa Ana. The passenger was 
convicted in an earlier trial. 
</P>
<P>
Shot and killed that night were Frank Villa, 21, and Anthony Silerio, 18. 
</P>
<P>
There was some dispute at Halstead's trial over whether the defendant was in 
fact reaching for a gun in the car and whether he acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Also in conlict was testimony over who among the gang members on the street 
that night initiated the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County prosecutors maintained that the Los Angeles gang members provoked 
the confrontation by cruising down the streets of Santa Ana shouting "Diamond 
heads!' -- their gang affiliation -- and verbally harassing Santa Ana gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
But Halstead maintained that he and his friends were just in Santa Ana to have 
a good time. In Los Angeles, they had met several girls from Santa Ana who 
invited the young men to return with them that night for a party, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Santa Ana, Halstead maintained, the young men were confronted by 
members of Santa Ana's F Troop gang in a gray station wagon that blocked their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Halstead said in the interview that the Diamond Head gang members from Los 
Angeles had no dispute with Santa Ana's F Troopers. "We never even heard of 
them before that night." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss details of the confrontation but said: "I didn't do 
anything wrong. I was innocent." The interview was cut short when Halstead's 
family members objected to his speaking with the press. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Middleton nor defense attorney Arthur 
Goldberg of Los Angeles was available late Thursday to comment on the case. The 
jury returned its verdict late in the afternoon in the courtroom of Judge John 
J. Ryan.

CHAPMAN WILL DROP 6 SPORTS AND STAY IN NCAA DIVISION II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chapman College will eliminate six sports from its athletic program while it 
continues to compete on the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II 
level, school officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Men's volleyball, women's tennis, men's and women's cross-country and men's and 
women's track and field will be dropped beginning the 1989-90 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the school's board of trustees came after months of speculation 
that the school would drop to Division III. Some school officials felt that the 
college would be more competitive at the lower division. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a much clearer direction and a mandate from the board which we've not 
had in a long time," Chapman's acting President Jim Doti said Thursday. "We can 
put behind us the ongoing questions about what level we should be at." 
</P>
<P>
Men's and women's basketball, women's volleyball, baseball, men's and women's 
soccer, softball, men's tennis and water polo will remain as intercollegiate 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches of the eliminated sports will not have their contracts renewed, Doti 
said. Charlie Appell is the coach of men's and women's cross-country and men's 
and women's track and field, John Hancock is the coach of women's tennis and 
John Burns is the coach of men's volleyball. Only Appell was a full-time coach. 
</P>
<P>
Appell's contract expires on Aug. 31, Hancock's and Burns' contracts end May 
31. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we're remaining Division II, it's not a day for celebration," 
Athletic Director Walt Bowman said. "We're losing some good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Appell said: "They didn't tell me why (my sports are being cut), they never do. 
I have already done my scheduling for next fall. Until 2 days ago, I didn't 
think there was anything to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Doti said the decision to cut the sports was based on student involvement and 
spectator appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Those sports did not enhance -- as others do -- the student life on campus," 
Doti said. "The programs we kept have the potential for success." 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating the six sports, the school will be in a better financial 
position, according to Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
However, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball and baseball 
will be the only sports to offer scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman also said the women's basketball coach would become a full-time position 
next year. Current women's Coach Paul Kahn is a part-time employee. Kahn has 
guided the Panthers into the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament in 
each of his 2 seasons at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
But Bowman said the school will conduct a "nationwide search" for a women's 
coach, as well as a men's basketball coach to replace Kevin Wilson, who was 
fired in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I've earned the full-time position," Kahn said. "But, so far Walt 
hasn't talked to me about the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that Kahn and Rich Prospero, who is the men's interim basketball 
coach, were welcome to apply for the positions. 
</P>
<P>
The other sports that have been retained -- softball, men's soccer, men's 
tennis and water polo -- will receive funding, but beginning next fall, 
athletes in those sports will not receive scholarships. Athletes already under 
scholarship will continue to receive funds. 
</P>
<P>
There are no athletes under scholarship in the sports that were eliminated, 
Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman did not say how many scholarships the school would offer next school 
year, only that "it's below the NCAA limit." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ends weeks of speculation and concern among the members of the 
school's athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
"This place has been extremely tense for days," one coach said. "Everyone's 
been on edge." 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they delayed the release of the decision until everyone 
in the athletic department could be informed. Bowman met with coaches Thursday 
afternoon and then with the student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted our people to hear about it from the school first," Bowman said. 
"And we wanted time to anticipate any questions."

RODRIGUEZ STATUS REMAINS UNCLEAR FOR FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Cal State Fullerton gymnastics season opens tonight without a decision on 
whether men's team captain Eli Rodriguez will be permitted to compete while he 
awaits trial on a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was suspended after his involvement in the stabbing of a former 
teammate in September. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dick Wolfe, citing a shortage of available gymnasts, says it will be 
mathematically impossible for Fullerton to win without Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough people to field five gymnasts in each event without him," 
Wolfe said. "We would have to take 0's, and you can't win if you do that." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was allowed to resume practicing with the team in November after the 
charge was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
But Athletic Director Ed Carroll said the matter is "still under review" and 
that he didn't know if he would make a decision before the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a definite timetable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The men take on San Jose State and the women take on Stanford. ROBYN NORWOOD

University High School broke open a close game in the third quarter and coasted 
to a 56-38 victory over foul-prone Newport Harbor in a Sea View League girls' 
basketball game Thursday at University. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans (15-4 overall, 4-0 in league play) made 24 of 39 free throws; 
Newport Harbor hit 3 of 7 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (3-13, 1-3) had 4 players foul out in the fourth quarter after 
the Trojans had built a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Davis and Denise Gandara each scored 18 points for University. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor trailed, 22-16, at halftime and scored the first 4 points in the 
third quarter to trail by 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
But University went on a 12-2 run, including a technical foul on Newport Harbor 
Coach David Barela. 
</P>
<P>
"We rebounded a lot better in the second half," University Coach Doug Sorey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who scored 5 of her 18 points on free throws, grabbed 12 rebounds. 
Stacey Giem led Newport Harbor with 17 points before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the trap and that stopped Giem from getting off her shot," Sorey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
University scored the first 12 points of the game and took a 13-4 lead by the 
end of the first quarter. LARRY NISTA

BIG INCREASE IN S&amp;L CONSOLIDATIONS PREDICTED; 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT EXPERT NOTES TAX BENEFITS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE ELIMINATED NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The great year-end rush to buy insolvent savings and loans may be only a 
precursor to a greater number of mergers and acquisitions in the S&amp;L 
industry this year, a local accounting expert predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining tax benefits coupled with other incentives will fuel a "substantial 
increase" in S&amp;L consolidations in 1989, said Peter Capobianco, national 
director of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.'s financial institutions group. 
</P>
<P>
Capobianco, who works out of Leventhal's Newport Beach office, would not 
estimate how many insolvent S&amp;Ls would be acquired this year, but he 
pointed out that about 400 insolvent institutions are still operating 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, federal regulators merged 179 bankrupt S&amp;Ls into healthy firms, 
closed 26 more and infused cash and notes into 18 others to stabilize them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the major basket cases, such as American Savings &amp; Loan and Beverly 
Hills Savings &amp; Loan, were revived with new owners and federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"This coming year could be the final opportunity for investors who seek to buy 
out troubled thrifts to take advantage of tax credits," Capobianco said. The 
tax benefits that spurred so many mergers last year have been reduced this year 
and are scheduled to be eliminated next year, under current tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board is urging the Congress to reinstate the full 
effect of the tax benefits to aid the agency's effort to salvage the insolvent 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Capobianco's prediction of more mergers comes amid howls from Congress that the 
tax benefits are robbing the U.S. Treasury of billions of dollars in taxes that 
should be paid in the coming years by profitable companies that have picked up 
the insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
In December alone, federal regulators said they gave buyers nearly $17 billion 
in assistance in arranging the mergers and acquisitions of 75 S&amp;Ls 
nationwide. That assistance will generate about $4 billion in tax breaks, about 
half of which will go to buyers and the rest to the bank board's deposit 
insurance unit, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in Orange County, the state's biggest graveyard for failed S&amp;Ls, 
regulators spent or pledged more than $5.7 billion in rescuing four insolvent 
S&amp;Ls and closing two others. The assistance to the four S&amp;Ls rescued 
should generate at least $1.1 billion more in tax benefits, according to 
figures provided by Capobianco and the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
The companies that bought insolvent county S&amp;Ls last year can take 
advantage of hefty benefits for the next 10 years: 
</P>
<P>
* New American Holdings Inc., the Irvine company used by the Robert M. Bass 
Group of Ft. Worth to buy American Savings &amp; Loan, received $1.7 billion in 
federal assistance, which will generate about $870 million in tax breaks. The 
company will get 25% of the benefits, FSLIC the rest. 
</P>
<P>
* Michigan National Corp., a suburban Detroit banking firm that bought Beverly 
Hills Savings &amp; Loan in Mission Viejo, received $983 million in federal 
assistance, which will generate $159 million in tax breaks. The company will 
get $87.5 million, with the rest going to FSLIC. 
</P>
<P>
* Downey Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, which bought Butterfield Savings 
&amp; Loan in Santa Ana, received $281.1 million in assistance and will get to 
use $150 million of the tax benefits generated, Capobianco said. 
</P>
<P>
Total figures for deals involving Butterfield and Ramona Savings &amp; Loan in 
Orange, which was bought last February by Midwest Federal Savings &amp; Loan in 
Minneapolis, were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Those tax benefits do not include an unknown amount of so-called tax loss 
carry-forwards, which are tax benefits that insolvent institutions get from 
losses sustained in previous years, said Bobby Hughes, the bank board's tax 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board is calculating how much in total tax benefits, including the tax 
loss carry-forwards, has been generated by nearly $39 billion in federal 
assistance involved in all deals in recent years. More than $37 billion of that 
assistance from the bank board's deposit insurance unit, the Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corp., came during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the tax benefits included in the transactions, it would probably cost 
us more to fix the problems caused by all these insolvent" savings and loans, 
said William Fulwider, a bank board spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Capobianco said the bank board offers other incentives, such as waivers from 
certain federal regulations and cash assistance and FSLIC promissory notes.

ARCHIVE CORP. REPORTS 39% RISE IN PROFITS FOR FIRST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archive Corp., a Costa Mesa manufacturer of tape drives for computers, said it 
earned $3.2 million for the first quarter ended Dec. 30, a 39% increase over 
last year's profits of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 36% during the quarter, to $36 million from $26.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it had finished buying back 1 million shares of stock during 
the quarter because it believes that the tape drive market will grow faster 
than the overall computer market. 
</P>
<P>
Tape drives convert information stored on computer tapes to signals a computer 
can use. 
</P>
<P>
Archive said it had also cut costs during the quarter to improve its gross 
margin, a measure of efficiency obtained by subtracting the cost of the 
products from sales revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The company also began selling products for the Apple Computer Macintosh market 
for the first time during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Archive announced earlier this week that it had signed a multi-million-dollar 
agreement with H. Ross Perot, who will invest in the development of new 
products at the company. 
</P>
<P>
Archive said the prospects for the remaining three quarters of its fiscal year 
are "excellent." MICHAEL FLAGG

UNIFIED-EUROPE MARKET PUSH RAISES FEARS;

NATIONS INVOLVED HAVE DIFFERENT AXES TO GRIND

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent months some of Britain's leading business tycoons have appeared in 
newspaper advertisements selling not their own products but the prospect of the 
year 1992. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the 12-member European Economic Community will attempt to form a 
single internal market free of trade barriers and big enough to counterbalance 
the traditional economic and industrial dominance of the United States and the 
thrusting power of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The action promises both opportunity and danger. To break down historic 
continental rivalries, almost as bitter in the marketplace as on the 
battlefield, requires a complex web of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The British want free trade without loss of sovereignty. The Germans want to 
penetrate other countries' markets but are reluctant to dismantle their own 
barriers. The French see an opportunity to strengthen their domestic economy as 
well as their international influence while forestalling long-dreaded U.S. 
dominance. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller countries see themselves sharing a larger pie. The poor ones have 
already received a promise of more development funding. 
</P>
<P>
How far it should all go is still a matter of intense debate, and considerable 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the Common Market's 
executive branch, favors a sort of European superstate in which, within a 
decade, 80% of central economic decisions will be made in Brussels, Belgium. 
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has dismissed that vision as "airy 
fairy." She rejects any notion of the "Identikit European." She clings to a 
latter-day Gaullist view of a Europe of separate and distinct nations. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany wants a European central bank, a social 
compact covering common standards for workers' rights and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
He says: "Europe cannot take shape unless its citizens identify with it. That 
is why, for me, the social dialogue is a vital part of the living 'Europe of 
Citizens.' " 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other leaders would side with him. Thatcher will have none of it. 
For her, 1992 will bring in a single European market but not a United States of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"From our prime minister's perspective, 1992 is about extending Thatcherite 
free markets from a national to a European plane," says William Wallace of the 
Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House. 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "We are all aware (that) in the American market you have to play by 
American rules. If you want to have an international economy that is not 
entirely run on American rules, you have to have a strong European market." 
</P>
<P>
Britain has consistently been the odd man out in Europe, complaining about 
loose budgeting and profligate farm spending. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the British government has spent millions of dollars on an 
advertising campaign in which the country's most successful entrepreneurs have 
urged their less enterprising colleagues to be prepared for what is about to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a rush of takeovers and mergers is under way as U.S. and Japanese 
companies seek a solid base in Europe and European companies seek a broader 
continental network, all in anticipation of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
There is resentment here that French nationalized companies are buying a stake 
in the British private sector, when British companies cannot make 
counter-sorties into certain sectors of the French economy. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans are overcoming their traditional opposition to hostile 
takeovers to seek part of the continental action but seem less ready to 
dismantle their own monopolies.

PBS 13-PART DOCUMENTARY SERIES LETS PARTICIPANTS TELL STORY OF NUCLEAR AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA BRENNAN, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first atomic explosion, in July, 1945, in the desert of New Mexico, changed 
the world forever. Since then, nations with nuclear weapons and those without 
have been obliged to do their political maneuvering in a world that could 
destroy itself. 
</P>
<P>
PBS' 13-part documentary series, "War and Peace in the Nuclear Age," premiering 
Monday, sets out to examine a subject of major importance both now and in the 
future, as well as to offer a retrospective on how we arrived at the atomic 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Zvi Dor-Ner, who began the project in 1984, noted: "All the 
nations who have nuclear weapons say they need them to preserve peace. . . . 
Yet they have risked nuclear war to preserve other values they believe in. This 
tension is the story of 'War and Peace in the Nuclear Age.' 
</P>
<P>
"We tell the story through its participants -- neither heroes nor villains, 
simply ordinary people thrust into situations of extraordinary magnitude and 
complexity." 
</P>
<P>
Although the film makers had hoped to arrive at solutions, they eventually 
concluded that they had no answers. Instead, they settled for trying to 
increase understanding. Each installment has been planned to cover a theme and 
historic period. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's opener, called "Dawn," goes back to the scientific experiments of 1932 
that led to the development of the atomic bomb, and to the desperate days in 
the spring and summer of 1945 that preceded the first nuclear explosion at 
Alamogordo. 
</P>
<P>
The man responsible for developing the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, 
recalls: "A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent. I 
remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita: 'Now I am 
become Death, destroyer of worlds.' " 
</P>
<P>
The following installment is "The Weapon of Choice," tracing how two former 
allies, the United States and the Soviet Union, became adversaries, each able 
to wield a nuclear arsenal.

ANN CONWAY: BIG NAMES DECORATE DINNER'S GUEST LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guess who's coming to dinner? 
</P>
<P>
Norman Lear, Judith Krantz and Sir Daniel Donahue, a frequent escort of Loretta 
Young, are among the glitterati who plan to attend the gala opening Feb. 4 of 
the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
On the menu: something continental with a Scandinavian flair, whipped up under 
the sophisticated eyes of chefs from Gustaf Anders, an elegant restaurant that 
will open in South Coast Village mid-February (owners Wilhelm Gustaf Magnuson 
and Ulf Anders Strandberg recently closed their fashionable La Jolla dining 
spot to become part of the Orange County scene). 
</P>
<P>
On view: an ensemble of loaned collectibles -- Krantz's pricey snuff boxes, 
Alice Avery O'Neill's whimsical tea caddies, some of developer Art Birtcher's 
rare antiques -- that will be part of the center's premier exhibit, "California 
Style: Collectors and Collections." 
</P>
<P>
The center, a dream come true of Capistrano antiques authority G.R. (Gep) 
Durenberger, is the first of its kind on the West Coast. And, if the prediction 
of Stanley Barrows, dean emeritus of the Parsons School of Design in New York, 
comes true, it will become the Cooper-Hewitt -- the museum for decorative arts 
in New York -- of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz is among Durenberger's treasured clients, and it was at a bash in her 
stylish Los Angeles home last fall that Lear and his wife, Lyn, met 
Durenberger. Now, they -- Durenberger and Krantz -- met through interior 
designer Joan Axelrod, wife of George Axelrod, producer ("The Manchurian 
Candidate") and screenwriter ("Breakfast at Tiffany's"). 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to attend: revered designer John Saladino, a Notre Dame chum of 
Durenberger who has done interiors for such clients as Susan Harris, creator of 
television's "The Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
One notable who hoped to attend but sent sad regrets: Bill Blass, the designer 
whose clothes are frequently worn by Barbara Bush. He's sending party favors 
instead, flacons of Blass fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
(By the way, according to insiders, it was supposed to be a gown by Blass or 
Arnold Scaasi that the new First Lady would wear when she whirled about the 
inaugural balls. Scaasi won.) 
</P>
<P>
Pearls of wisdom: Speaking of Barbara Bush's favorites, Kenneth Jay Lane's 
boutique of faux jewels at South Coast Plaza is being overrun by seekers of 
pearls, a la the kind Mrs. Bush sports on a regular basis. "Sales are up 25%," 
said Melissa Parker, vice president and fashion director for Lane in New York. 
</P>
<P>
(You probably know this, but Lane was a favorite designer of the Duchess of 
Windsor. In fact, Lane was so favored that the duchess was buried in one of his 
unreal diamond belts.) 
</P>
<P>
Lane is betting that Barbara Bush will don his pearls when she dresses for 
inaugural festivities. "I'm sure she'll wear them to the inauguration," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker is quick to remind you that Nancy Reagan also loves Lane's double- and 
triple-strand necklaces, which sell for $135 and $155, respectively. "He 
created them for Bill Blass a few seasons ago," she said. "Blass wanted 
something smart and savvy for his daytime suits." 
</P>
<P>
So what is it about pearls? Why are they the chosen necklace of classic women? 
"Ah, they are the perfect accessory," Parker said. "Very flattering. They give 
a woman a nice glow. When the light hits her face, it also bounces off the 
pearls and emphasizes the cheekbones. Everyone looks pretty in them." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the fact that double and triple strands "conceal neck wrinkles," 
Parker piped. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lane, well, look for him to visit his store in April. He loves to pop by 
Costa Mesa on his way to Swifty Lazar's annual Oscar party.

HOUSE CALLS; 
</P>
<P>
FROM FOOD TO FITNESS, YOU NAME IT AND THERE'S PROBABLY SOMEONE WHO WILL DELIVER 
IT TO YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NEEDHAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the trendy who "cocoon," for the plebeians who play couch potato, for those 
too busy for the freeways or too angst-ridden to drive, life can be lived at 
home. The good life. The swell life. The I'm-OK-who-cares-about-you life. 
</P>
<P>
Too tired to shop for groceries? Call Grocery Line, minimum order $50, fee 10% 
of the bill. Too flabby to show up in a gym? Call Body Sculpting. For $40 per 
1-hour session, three times a week, payable a month in advance, Jeff Bathiany 
will bring his gym and exercise equipment in his van to your house. Too 
disheveled to go to the beauty parlor? No problem, Rendezvous Images will come 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
In days of yore, the milkman delivered. The kid from the grocery store pedaled 
his bike to your door with your order. The doctor made house calls. Eventually, 
the milkman disappeared, though the guy from the pool service started coming 
by. The grocery store stopped delivering, and the gardener showed up instead. 
The doctor traded in the trusty black bag with a stethoscope and tongue 
depressor and stayed in the office with a million-dollar machine that diagnosed 
diseases almost before they were discovered. But people started delivering 
bottled water to your house. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the pendulum is swinging back in Orange County -- at least in 
neighborhoods where they eat Brie rather than Velveeta and drink wine from 
glasses instead of straight from a bottle wrapped in a brown bag. 
</P>
<P>
"Our typical client has the money to spend on the car; they have a nice car, 
and they don't have a lot of time to take care of it," said Bruce Strysik, who 
owns a car "detailing" business. The average cost to a Strysik customer is $100 
a month, for which the car is washed weekly and waxed and detailed monthly. 
Basically, a good detailing leaves a car looking better than when it left the 
showroom and features thorough vacuuming and loving attention to chrome, 
rubber, tires and wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the majority of our customers have a Mercedes," he said. "We of 
course will do any kind of car, but I would say we do more Mercedes than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
For the stay-at-homes who want good entertainment, there are sound engineers 
and audio-video suppliers like Greg Steffani, who works for a San Juan 
Capistrano company called Home Electronic Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Steffani's company is installing a $180,000 system in a house being built that 
will cost more than $4 million when it's done. The system includes doors that 
open as people approach and close behind them, a specially designed column in a 
bathroom that swings around and unveils a TV, and a living room couch that 
pivots so people on one end of the L-shaped couch won't have to look over their 
shoulders when a projector pops up from the floor, a screen comes down from the 
ceiling and the movie starts. 
</P>
<P>
Steffani's firm has also done jobs for $2,000. "Almost everything we do, 
somebody has a little something extra they want," he said. Sometimes they want 
to control a downstairs videocassette recorder from an upstairs bedroom. 
Sometimes they want speakers in showers and saunas, or under water in the 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Business is good, Steffani said, because of all the new construction in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
For the evening's entertainment on the newly installed video system, there are 
stores that will deliver the cassette you've been meaning to see. There's a 
hitch with orders from the Video Station, though: The customer has to order a 
pizza from the restaurant next door, as well. The pizza person delivers the pie 
and the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cresci, owner of the Mission Viejo video store, said the system started 
out of necessity: There were too few parking spaces at the shopping center 
where his shop is located. The movie charge is $2.50 a day, same as pick-ups at 
the shop. 
</P>
<P>
The pizza-and-movies combo "is just another thing that we do to be different, 
to be competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those seeking finer fare than pizza, Restaurant Express will pick up a meal 
at a nice restaurant and deliver it to the home. The price is just $4 more than 
what the restaurant charges for on-scene diners, and instead of tipping the 
waiter one greases the palm of the delivery person. 
</P>
<P>
The bare-cupboard crew, meanwhile, can find help from Grocery Line. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach firm began operations in September and provides customers 
with a catalogue of 3,000 items available from the Pacific Ranch Market. A 
partner in the company, Frank Greenberg, said orders placed from 8 a.m. to noon 
are delivered by 5 p.m. to "an affluent client base" from Irvine south to San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said 98% of the company's customers are women and estimated the 
household income at $60,000 to $80,000 a year. His customers are "more 
concerned with quality and service than they are with price," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
By storing orders in a computer, the company can file the customer's 
preferences in such matters as cuts of meat, ripeness of vegetables and color 
of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
If no one's home, refrigerated items are placed in an ice chest; the delivery 
person sometimes picks up a check for the groceries left in the same place, 
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
How about thefts from an unguarded ice chest? Greenberg said his company 
delivers to "upscale neighborhoods . . . not an area where there's a lot of 
pilferage. . . . Most of their neighbors wouldn't be caught dead stealing a 
carton of milk." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bathiany sees people who want to work off their calories away from health 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Bathiany has a small van with a stationary bicycle and two exercise machines 
that he brings to clients' homes three times a week, serving people who believe 
that gyms are too crowded and "you're always waiting for your machine." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "people find any excuse not to go" to a gym. They say, "I need gas 
in the car, I've got dinner cooking," Bathiany said. When the van shows up at 
the house and Bathiany rings the doorbell, it reminds his body builders they've 
already paid nearly $500 a month in advance, so they'd better start pumping 
iron. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bathiany's fee is about 20 times what some gyms charge, he said his 
clients look at it as "just part of their monthly bill" for various services. 
He consults on nutrition as well and tries to get people used to a routine of 
working out that will eventually spur them to join a gym. But he has had 
customers for 2 years, he said, because "they go to a gym, quit, go to a gym, 
quit," and then go back to him. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fischer, president of an ad agency, said that although Bathiany isn't 
actually a company employee, "I just look at it as someone (else) on my 
payroll" when it comes time to write the monthly check. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to develop some healthy habits that would turn into a natural 
regimen for me, which it has," Fischer said, adding that he has "lost 25 pounds 
of fat and gained maybe 8 pounds of muscle" since starting to work out with 
Bathiany nearly 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds, said his neighbors started 
complaining about the van, so he now meets Bathiany and the mobile gym at a 
supermarket parking lot in Newport Beach 3 nights a week for his workouts. 
</P>
<P>
For those with shining cars, well-fed and well-exercised bodies, a good haircut 
is always important. Again, they don't have to drive to the beauty parlor, 
though they do have to walk out the front door. 
</P>
<P>
Max Derseweh and his wife, Maureen, have a rolling beauty salon that makes 
house calls for a minimum of four people. Haircuts run $23 for men and $30 for 
women, done at one of two "stations" in a customized 30-foot-long van, which 
also has an upstairs waiting room. Derseweh said many of his customers are 
working women or women at home with children who don't want to battle traffic 
to get their hair done. 
</P>
<P>
He said a survey last year on women's issues in Southern California "showed 
that the average woman spends 40 minutes driving to and from the hair salon. If 
you can eliminate that time . . . we like to believe we can give this type of 
service and more quality time with the family." 
</P>
<P>
Derseweh figures his typical customer gets her hair done every 4 to 6 weeks, 
and a fingernail treatment every 2 to 3 weeks. He's hoping to get a van just 
for nails one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
When a van or RV -- or even a car -- needs routine maintenance, Pam Baksa, 
owner of California Auto Clinic in Santa Ana, is willing to send someone to the 
house. The minimum charge is $65, and Baksa said that covers most bills. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the firm's mobile business is towing motorists whose cars break down, 
she said, but there are people who prefer to get preventive work done on their 
chariots at work or at home. 
</P>
<P>
"People are extremely busy today, especially in the Orange County area," Baksa 
said. "Time is of the essence. It's sad but true, we don't have a lot of time 
to waste. We're always in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Few things can slow down a person in a hurry more than chasing a recalcitrant 
pet that has just seen a cat or dog carrier appear, conjuring up visions of a 
trip to the vet. Even if the animal is tracked down and captured, there's the 
barking, meowing, whining and wailing en route to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Mooradian has a shortcut for all that. Mooradian runs a van service through 
the Newport Harbor Animal Hospital and Newport Hills Animal Hospital, coming to 
the house to pick up the pet and take it in for its shots, grooming or medical 
treatment. "I pick (the animals) up in the morning before people go to work and 
bring them back at night," said Mooradian, who has customized his van with 
kennels to accommodate dogs of all sizes, from Chihuahuas to German shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
If the hospital does not offer the service free to a customer, Mooradian 
charges from $8 to $24 for a round trip, depending on the distance, and donates 
$1 of that to the organization Guide Dog Boosters of America, which supports 
the use of guide dogs by blind people. Although he can bring a veterinarian out 
with him in an emergency, he said most of the three to seven animals he moves a 
day are simply being ferried from their homes to the animal hospital and back 
in his van. 
</P>
<P>
Other at-home services include swimming lessons, from, yes, YMCA. The West 
County Family YMCA offers swimming classes for people using their back-yard 
pool. The Y, which asks for pool donations because it does not have a pool of 
its own, pays for the insurance and organizes the classes of about five 
children each. Last year, 20 to 30 families donated their pools, according to 
Janice Patrick, executive director of the West County Family YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know how to swim but don't know how to use a computer can get help 
too, from college student Martin Anderson, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson charges $50 an hour, with a 1-hour minimum, to come to a customer's 
house and explain how to use that spiffy-looking computer that did everything 
except slice bread in the store but just sits there like a dumb piece of 
furniture now that it's home. Anderson said he has occasionally repaired 
computers but prefers to show someone how to use the machine or to change the 
programming so it can do what the buyer thought it would do. 
</P>
<P>
And, miracle of miracles, there's actually a doctor in the county who makes 
house calls. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dean S. Wood, a 51-year-old specialist in internal medicine, moved from the 
San Fernando Valley in 1982 and found Orange County "overloaded with doctors" 
practicing in his specialty. He joined with other doctors who made house calls 
so he could "become employable right away." 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he limits his practice to about 200 patients, nearly all of whom are 
"elderly with a lot of medical problems" and find it difficult to travel to a 
doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Although he doesn't charge extra for house calls and figures he could make 
twice as much money by maintaining an office practice and catering to wealthier 
patients, "I certainly know that I'm needed," Wood said.

HOT TOPICS: SWEETS, ITALIAN, ORIENTAL LEAD FAVORITE FOODS LIST

"Catch air." 
</P>
<P>
That's what they came to see Saturday night, when people of all ages met on 
common ground, packing the floor of the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
What brought a crowd of about 1,600 fans together was the Vision Street Wear 
2-Hip King of Vert Finals -- a freestyle bicycle competition that favored those 
who could soar the highest and pull off incredible airborne tricks aboard their 
BMX bikes. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-Hip series, one of several competitions throughout the United States, 
combines the finesse of bicycle freestyle with the thrills of half-pipe 
skateboard riding. 
</P>
<P>
During the competition, the riders -- six professionals and eight amateurs -- 
took turns on a specially constructed, 50-foot-by-10-foot, wooden half-pipe 
ramp. Their objective was to reach the top of each side and continue on into 
the air to heights of up to 15 feet, where twists and turns were performed. The 
contestants were judged on skill, difficulty of maneuvers and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Hoffman, a 17-year-old amateur rider from Oklahoma City, not only won 
Saturday's amateur competition, but also was allowed to compete in the 
professional event -- and took first place, worth $2,200 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"Hoffman is the best as far as I am concerned," said Gary Laurent, 22, of Las 
Vegas, who finished second in the amateur division. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman also received the Amateur of the Year award, while Brian Blyther, 20, 
of Ontario, was named Pro of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the thrills of the 2-hour competition came when Hoffman performed a 
"fakie" -- going up into the air facing forward, then coming back down and 
riding down the vertical ramp backwards. 
</P>
<P>
As the announcer encouraged the crowd with endless "let's make some noise" 
requests, Blyther pulled off a pair of 540-degree turns in a row on both sides 
of the ramp. However, when he attempted a 900-degree turn -- his last maneuver 
of the night -- he fell and re-injured an ankle that he had previously broken 
attempting the same trick last November at a show in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Blyther finished second in the professional division and took 
home $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was represented Saturday by rider Josh White, 21, of Huntington 
Beach. White, who graduated from high school in Oregon before moving to the 
Southland, finished last in the pro division. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an injured foot and wasn't even going to enter, but my managers wanted 
me to compete," he explained. "I wasn't in near the kind of shape I should have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
White began freestyle bicycle competition 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something different, kind of new and exciting," said White of the sport 
that has become his full-time job. He said he competed in 15 to 16 contests 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing I could ask for in my sport is getting to travel everywhere," 
he said. "I've been to about 40 of the 50 states, Japan, France and England. . 
. . But California is where I want to live for sure."

SHOPPING: VITTADINI MAINTAINS AN ORGANIZED CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With clothes tucked neatly into cabinets and not a mannequin in sight, the new 
Adrienne Vittadini store at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court looks more like a 
million-dollar closet than a fashion boutique. And that's exactly how the 
fashion designer planned it. 
</P>
<P>
"Adrienne wanted a store that wouldn't feel like a store," says Ross Manning, 
owner of the new Crystal Court boutique. "She wanted women to feel like they 
are walking into a grand wardrobe. She wanted it dramatic and sophisticated, 
but extremely practical and elegant. Like the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Vittadini, the 44-year-old Hungarian-born designer of softly structured women's 
knitwear, has expanded her lines in the past few years to include evening wear, 
swimwear, scarfs and handbags. Parts of her collections are found in almost 
every major department store in the country, but Vittadini recently launched an 
effort to open boutiques so that nearly everything in her collections can be 
found in one spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Crystal Court store, her third and newest boutique, will carry about 500 
new items each season, about $150,000 worth of merchandise at any one time, 
according to Manning. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 2,000-square-foot shop was designed by Milan architect Gai Aulenti, 
who was also responsible for restoring Venice's Palazzo Grassi as an art museum 
and for designing the new Musee d'Orsay in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Shipped in 18 crates last fall, components of the salon were designed and 
custom-made in Italy and reassembled at Crystal Court. Italian craftsmen made 
everything from the 26 hand-milled, bleached beechwood cabinets to the 52 brass 
clothes rods, as well as the 24-foot-long glass-topped beechwood table on which 
the floral arrangements and visual props designed by Larry Laslo are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Laslo and Vittadini collaborate on the look of everything Vittadini does except 
the clothes: the gift boxes, the floral arrangements, the window displays and 
the design props seen throughout the store. During a visit from New York to 
oversee completion of the boutique, which opened at the end of November, Laslo 
said Vittadini's operation is similar to Ralph Lauren's in that every aspect of 
the business is programmed to look the way Vittadini and Laslo want it to look. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very uniform throughout the collection," Laslo said. "Every detail is 
planned and designed as one statement, from the gift boxes to the window 
designs." 
</P>
<P>
The windows in all three Vittadini boutiques (the others are in Beverly Hills 
and St. Louis) are changed weekly to reflect the evolution of the collections, 
Laslo said. "There is constant newness, and her windows must reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
Although the store's overall design is a traffic stopper -- a huge domed 
ceiling with a skylight tops the built-in cabinetry -- the various elements are 
purposely understated to draw attention to the clothes. For example, beechwood 
was chosen as the shop's motif because of its subtlety; the clothes stand out 
dramatically against its pale grain, Manning said. "The store was really 
designed with the clothes in mind. It's meant to be a showcase for the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
That collection keeps growing and is constantly exploring new territory, 
Manning added. Among the most recent additions are the designer's 
pearl-studded, hand-knit sweaters ($190), which can be paired with a number of 
cotton, black-and-white separates. 
</P>
<P>
Also new are the hibiscus-print cotton tops, wide-legged pants and silk shirts. 
Prices in the store range from $35 for a scarf to $400 for an evening outfit. A 
long, black-and-white striped knit tunic -- a Vittadini signature piece -- 
sells for $145. 
</P>
<P>
The designer's spring line is gradually filling up the Crystal Court store, 
replacing last season's holiday and cruise wear. Inspired by the movie "White 
Mischief," many of the pieces have a '40s look: navy-and-white, wide-legged 
career trousers; silk jumpsuits and long skirts. 
</P>
<P>
Desert shades and safari-inspired sportswear, dropped torso dresses and linen 
separates are also prominent. So are bold red-and-white striped pants and sheer 
striped shirts and long, poppy-printed jackets. The spring evening wear uses 
lots of black and white, with hand-knit sweaters, silk blouses and rhinestone 
bows.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev congratulated President Bush on his 
inauguration today and expressed hope that superpower relations will be stable 
during his term in office, Tass press agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In his message to the new President, Gorbachev said Bush is coming to power in 
an atmosphere of improved Soviet-American ties. "Further joint efforts by the 
Soviet Union and the United States will make it possible substantially to bring 
closer the solution of the most painful problems of the present time, above all 
those connected with the need to eliminate the threat of war," Gorbachev said.

A panel formed to investigate the slaying that touched off this week's racial 
violence met for the first time today as civic and community leaders sought to 
maintain calm for the Super Bowl weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't go on having racial disturbances every five years -- if this goes on, 
the whole city is going to burn down," said the Rev. Richard Barry, chairman of 
the 11-member panel of police officers and black residents. The board will 
investigate the death of Clement Lloyd, 23, an unarmed black motorcyclist shot 
in the head by a Latino police officer Monday. Riots triggered by the shooting 
left one man dead and seven others shot in two black neighborhoods. Thirteen 
buildings were torched and others were looted.

<P>
George Herbert Walker Bush was inaugurated 41st President of the United States 
today, describing the nation at the end of the Reagan era as prosperous and at 
peace but promising that "a new breeze is blowing." 
</P>
<P>
He then jubilantly led his inaugural parade to the White House, stepping out of 
his limousine twice to walk a short part of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The new President, holding hands with his wife, Barbara, waved to cheering 
onlookers as he walked between his car and a Secret Service vehicle along 
Constitution Avenue and again along a stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. Vice 
President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, followed a similar pattern in their 
car farther back. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Republican Bush told Democratic congressional leaders that his 
would be "the age of the offered hand." To the world, he said the offered hand 
would be "a reluctant fist," which once made, would be "strong and . . . used 
with great effect." 
</P>
<P>
The noontime transfer of power had to be as satisfying to Ronald Reagan as to 
Bush. Not since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1961 had a President finished a full 
two terms, and it had been 60 years since a President bequeathed office to a 
man of his own party. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 p.m., Bush recited the 35-word oath of office, resting his left hand 
on two Bibles held by his wife, Barbara. One edition was a family Bible; the 
other was used by George Washington at his swearing-in 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200,000 Watch Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
Bush took the oath at the West Front of the Capitol, standing on a red-carpeted 
stage behind a clear, bulletproof shield. A crowd estimated at 200,000 spilled 
across the Capitol lawn to witness the ceremony under cloudy skies and mild 
temperatures that hit 50 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Bush was sworn in by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a 
21-gun salute boomed over the Capitol and echoed off the marble monuments. 
</P>
<P>
After his inaugural address, the Bushes escorted the Reagans to a waiting 
helicopter. It carried the Reagans to Andrews Air Force Base, detouring briefly 
to circle low over the White House. At Andrews, Reagan reviewed the troops one 
final time before flying into retirement in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Just carry on." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's final words in Washington: "Just carry on." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush was asked about saying goodby to Reagan. "I was trying to keep the 
tears from running down my cheeks. After eight years of friendship, it was 
pretty tough," the new President said. 
</P>
<P>
Before leading the inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White 
House, Bush and his wife attended an elegant luncheon with congressional 
leaders in the marbled Statuary Hall in the Capitol. House Minority Leader Bob 
Michel presented Bush with an engraved portrait of Martin Van Buren, the last 
vice president to be elected President -- 152 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The incoming vice president, former Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, just 41 years old, 
took his oath at 11:57 a.m., his hand on a family Bible as he followed the 
words read by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. His wife, Marilyn, and 
their three children stood with him. 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Bush won applause with his vow against drugs: "This scourge 
will stop." It was perhaps his most specific promise in a speech that offered 
few details on a Bush agenda. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke directly to Democratic congressional leaders, saying the nation needs 
"compromise where there has been dissension." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Republicans and Democrats have often been too mistrustful, an 
attitude he traced back to the Vietnam War. "The final lesson of Vietnam is 
that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With that Bush said he meant to put out his hand to the Speaker of the House, 
Jim Wright, and to the majority leader of the Senate, George Mitchell. "This is 
the age of the offered hand," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He nodded directly to Wright and Mitchell, sitting among the VIPs near the 
lectern. Wright raised his hand in acknowledgment; Mitchell sat passively. 
Later the leaders met with Bush and watched as he signed papers formally 
nominating his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's address was to the nation as much as to Congress. He called for a "new 
activism" across the generations, saying, "America is never wholly herself 
unless she is engaged in high moral purpose. We as a people have such a purpose 
today. It is to make kinder the face of a nation and gentler the face of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless," he said, and 
Americans who cannot free themselves of "whatever addiction -- drugs, welfare, 
demoralization that rules the slums." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said "the old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone 
could end these problems. But we have learned that is not so. And in any case, 
our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"But will is what we need," he said. " . . . we will do the wisest thing of 
all: We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always 
grows: the goodness and courage of the American people."

With a trumpet salute, Bush was introduced at the ceremony one last time as

Dan Quayle was sworn in as vice president of the United States today, but 
failed to take the entire oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle placed his left hand on the family Bible held by his wife, Marilyn, and 
solemnly recited the vice president's oath of office, administered at his 
special request by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating after O'Connor, Quayle said: "I, J. Danforth Quayle, swear that I 
will support and defend the Constitution of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor failed to read out the following phrase, "against all enemies,

ISRAEL EASES CURB ON USING PLASTIC BULLETS;

Israel today authorized troops to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians burning 
tires and blocking roads and ordered all 1,200 schools in the West Bank shut 
indefinitely because of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, meanwhile, rejected peace proposals by Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, the man behind Israel's "iron fist" clampdown, and members of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud Party also criticized him. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin had called Thursday for a period of calm to prepare for elections in the 
occupied territories, leading to autonomy followed by a confederation between 
the West Bank and either Israel or Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
A senior defense source said the new easing of firing orders meant that 
noncommissioned officers could use plastic bullets to shoot stone-throwers, 
fleeing protesters and anyone blocking roads. 
</P>
<P>
An army spokeswoman said: "Because of severe disturbances in the latest period, 
in which (Arab) school students from (the West Bank) were active, the military 
government has ordered the closure of all schools . . . until an appropriate 
atmosphere for studying is created." 
</P>
<P>
Rabin's get-tough policy, which also allows troops to demolish the homes and 
close the stores of stone-throwers, has led to record numbers of Arab 
casualties in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians rejected Rabin's peace proposals as an attempt to bypass the PLO 
and the creation of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is not accepted by us. We don't accept elections in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip because we have got our leadership -- the PLO -- and we want to 
tell Mr. Rabin that he should not close his eyes," said Hilmi Hanoun, the 
veteran mayor of Tulkarem. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows very well we have a leadership for the Palestinians. If they want 
real peace, they know where they should go," he added.

BEA LILLIE, 'WORLD'S FUNNIEST WOMAN,' DIES AT 94

Bea Lillie, who was billed as "the funniest woman in the world" during a long 
theatrical career in Britain and the United States, died today at her home in 
Henley-on-Thames, her conservator said. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
"She just went this morning, peacefully, at 8:47 a.m.," said John Phillip Huck, 
who was associated with the actress for 40 years and was named her conservator 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Lillie was a master of elegant double-entendres and sharp ripostes delivered 
with a flourish of an enormously long cigarette-holder. She was, in the title 
of her 1973 autobiography, "Every Other Inch a Lady." 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born May 29, 1894, in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
She first appeared on a British stage in 1914 and made her American debut in 
1924 in a revue produced by Andre Charlot, and for two years she alternated 
between London and New York in his revues, which also starred Noel Coward and 
Gertrude Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, she appeared in New York in Coward's "This Year of Grace," which had a 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, Lillie took a dramatic role as the nurse in the New York premiere of 
George Bernard Shaw's "Too True to Be Good," but then returned to working in 
revues. Those included "At Home Abroad" in 1935, "The Show Is On" in 1936 and 
Coward's "Set to Music" in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, she also appeared in London in "All Clear." 
</P>
<P>
During the war she was a tireless entertainer of troops with sketches and 
Coward's one-act play, "Tonight at 8:30." 
</P>
<P>
She had married Sir Robert Peel, a descendant of the 19th-Century prime 
minister, in 1920. Peel died in 1934 and their only child, also named Robert, 
was killed during military service in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the New York stage in 1944 with "Seven Lively Arts" and was in 
"Inside U.S.A." in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
From 1952 to 1956, she toured the world in a one-woman act, "An Evening with 
Beatrice Lillie," which won a Tony Award in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958 she starred in London in "Auntie Mame," and made her last stage 
appearance in New York in 1964-65 in "High Spirits," a musical version of 
Coward's "Blithe Spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Her film credits included "Exit Smiling" in 1927, "Around the World in Eighty 
Days" in 1956 and "Thoroughly Modern Millie" in 1967.

Workers at Moscow's Lebedev Physics Institute nominated the physicist and Nobel

Egyptian police were looking for about 30 Muslim militants Thursday after an 
attack on a police station in which one man was killed, security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
They said a group of fundamentalists, apparently seeking weapons, attacked a 
police station on Tuesday at El Minya, 150 miles south of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Sobhi Yehia Saad, a 27-year-old member of the banned Jihad organization, was 
killed when security forces moved in to stop the attackers from ransacking the 
police post in an apartment block next to a mosque where the militants have set 
up their stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists regard most music, television shows and dancing as 
blasphemous and are seeking to enforce strict Islamic laws in several 
districts.

BUSH, THE INSIDER, WILL FORGO THE USUAL KITCHEN CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look for a Kitchen Cabinet from George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush takes the oath of office today, he will become the first new 
President in many years who will not have an inner circle of advisers -- former 
business associates, card-playing cronies, Army buddies and the like -- who 
serve as an informal but indispensable corps of non-governmental advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, his two predecessors, Bush has himself 
been a Washington insider for most of the past two decades. He has retained a 
few friends from his earlier days as a Texas oilman -- notably James A. Baker 
III, Nicholas F. Brady and Robert A. Mosbacher. 
</P>
<P>
But they will be in the real Cabinet, not the Kitchen Cabinet: Baker as 
secretary of state, Brady as Treasury secretary and Mosbacher as Commerce 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The close associates whom Bush has developed more recently have worked in his 
vice presidential office and on his presidential campaign, and they too will be 
part of the government. These include C. Boyden Gray, formerly counsel to the 
vice president and soon to be chief White House counsel; David Bates, deputy 
chief of the vice president's staff and soon to be Cabinet secretary; Chase 
Untermeyer, a longtime personal aide who is soon to be personnel director, and 
Andrew Card, a campaign operative who will be a top deputy to the White House 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any evidence so far of any kind of insiders' group," said 
Alexander B. Trowbridge Jr., head of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, a 
longtime acquaintance of Bush's from the business world and a former Commerce 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflection of Style 
</P>
<P>
"All the people he's picked for the main economic policy areas seem to have a 
longstanding close relationship of trust with George Bush," Trowbridge said. 
"These are people he's been talking to for years, and they've been on a 
first-name basis with him for years. But they also know their way around 
Washington and the ways of government. That makes a potent combination, and we 
haven't had that for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a distinct outside advisers clique is a reflection of Bush's 
management style. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush wants another viewpoint on an issue, he is more likely to call on a 
wide array of acquaintances than a few longtime cronies, those close to him 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very open and approachable person," said Richard Rahn, chief economist 
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and husband of Bush's key speech writer, Peggy 
Noonan. "He sure makes a lot of phone calls. He touches base with an enormous 
number of people. That's always been his habit, and it was even more so in the 
campaign. We're not going to have one of those presidencies where the man in 
the White House cuts himself off. It won't be like Johnson, Nixon, Carter, even 
Reagan -- who all had their barriers." 
</P>
<P>
If Bush did have a Kitchen Cabinet, former White House National Security 
Adviser Richard V. Allen said in an interview several months ago, "the numbers 
would already be in three digits, maybe four." 
</P>
<P>
That is a sharp departure from his immediate predecessors, who came to the 
White House as outsiders intent on changing the Washington way of government, 
and relied on longtime friends for advice on doing it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Over Appointments 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, when Reagan swept into office promising to curb an entrenched 
government bureaucracy, considerable influence was vested in a shadow cabinet 
of conservative Western businessmen: Holmes Tuttle, Joseph Coors and Justin 
Dart among them -- who provided suggestions and observations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Reagan's pre-inaugural Kitchen Cabinet is believed to have been behind 
some of the new President's initial Cabinet appointments. 
</P>
<P>
During his term, Carter depended heavily on a tight inner circle, largely drawn 
from the political and business world in Georgia, where he had been governor. 
Some critics blamed the outsiders' sway for the problems Carter had in making 
Washington's government machinery work for him. 
</P>
<P>
The last previous elected chief executive before Carter, Richard M. Nixon, 
plotted his moves with a coterie of Southern California public relations men 
and political tacticians who were little known until the Watergate scandal 
exposed his presidency's inner workings.

<P>
The unrestricted fare between the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles has 
been raised by 15%, making it the most expensive shuttle in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning on Thursday, American, United and USAir raised the fare on the 
315-mile trip to $148 from $129 each way. 
</P>
<P>
The fare hike applies to flights from San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in 
the Bay Area and to airports in Los Angeles, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario and 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
United said the fare hike was necessary to keep pace with fare increases 
elsewhere, and the airline called the increase "modest." 
</P>
<P>
The fare hike means the per-mile cost to fly between the Bay Area and Los 
Angeles is 47 cents. In contrast, the unrestricted fare between Washington, 
D.C., and New York is $99 each way, or 46 cents per mile. The Dallas to Houston 
shuttle is $59 one way, or 25 cents per mile. 
</P>
<P>
American, United and USAir control more than 90% of the business on flights 
between the Bay Area and the Los Angeles Basin, according to the U.S. 
Department of Transportation.

TEXACO INC. ACCEPTS $3.24-BILLION BID FOR CANADIAN OIL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texaco Inc. said today it will sell its 78% interest in Texaco Canada for $3.24 
billion in cash to Imperial Oil Ltd., Canada's largest integrated oil company, 
which is controlled by Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
If the rest of Texaco Canada's shareholders agree to sell their shares to 
Imperial, the deal will be worth $4.15 billion in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The sale marks one of the last steps in Texaco's restructuring since it emerged 
from bankruptcy after its multibillion-dollar lawsuit with Pennzoil Co. over 
the acquisition of Getty Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco Canada is the fourth-largest oil company in Canada, and the sale 
attracted several bidders, including Australia's Alan Bond. The agreement will 
allow Imperial a limited right to use Texaco's trademark for up to two years, 
while the Texaco-branded inventory is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Winning the bidding is a great coup for New York-based Exxon, already the 
world's largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exactly the price we were expecting," said oil analyst Richard Pzena at 
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The definitive agreement requires Imperial to tender for the remaining shares 
for the same price of $34.36 per share that will be paid for Texaco's 78% 
interest. There are about 4,500 small shareholders in Texaco Canada.

restructuring," said James Kinnear, Texaco president and chief executive 
officer, "we can focus on implementing the planned distribution of $1.7 billion 
to our shareholders, which we intend to announce just as soon as practical."

RJR NABISCO TO SELL S. AFRICA FIRMS

RJR Nabisco Inc.'s prospective new owner said today that it will sell the 
food-tobacco giant's holdings in South Africa, two days after Michigan withdrew 
from a fund used to help finance the record $24.53-billion takeover because of 
a new state law barring investments in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the New York investment house that won the 
bidding for RJR late last year, confirmed reports that it plans to sell Royal 
Beechnut to the division's South African management and to sell South African 
Preserving Co. as soon as possible after the takeover is formally completed. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures, made via Kohlberg's public relations agent Kekst &amp; Co., 
appeared to be a reaction to the announcement Wednesday by Michigan officials 
that they would prohibit a $110-million state pension investment in a Kohlberg 
fund that will help finance the RJR deal. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Treasurer Robert A. Bowman said such an investment conflicted with a 
law effective Jan. 1 banning state investments in companies with ties to South 
Africa.

A $35,000 racehorse being taken to a track in New Jersey was killed when the 
trailer carrying it jackknifed into a guardrail on Interstate 95, throwing it 
down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Motoring Dean, a 7-year-old pacer that had been listed as a 15-to-1 long shot, 
died about an hour after the accident despite rescue efforts by emergency 
medical technicians. 
</P>
<P>
The horse had been scheduled to make its first start in a year Thursday night 
at the Meadowlands, competing for a $7,500 purse in a mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Paquette of Wrentham, Mass., the horse's owner, trainer and driver, was 
driving south on the highway when another car cut him off, state police said. 
Paquette told troopers the trailer jackknifed when he put on his brakes, 
causing his pickup to roll over and crash into the guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
The horse was thrown out of the trailer and tumbled down the hill into a tree, 
breaking a leg.

West Germany's Claudia Leistner all but locked up the women's title as she took 
a commanding leading after today's original program at the European Figure 
Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Leistner skated to a lively version of big-band music that earned first-place 
marks from the judges. She had led after the school figures. 
</P>
<P>
With a factored placing of 1.0 with the free skating left, she would have to 
finish fourth or worse in the final program Saturday afternoon to lose the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Skating last, I had to wait a long time," Leistner said. "They all came back 
laughing or crying. But I felt good on the ice and I hope I can do it 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
If she skates as well as she did in the original program, she will not have any 
problem succeeding Katarina Witt as European champion. 
</P>
<P>
The next three places are extremely tight. Second was British champion Joanne 
Conway, who pleased the home crowd with a clean but safe routine. Third was the 
Soviet Union's Natalie Lebedeva and fourth was East Germany's Simone Lang. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets have won both titles already decided. Larisa Selezneva and Oleg Makarov 
won the pairs event and Aleksandr Fadeev captured the men's crown. 
</P>
<P>
Fadeev won his fourth European championship since 1984 despite being penalized 
by a British judge for his costume in Thursday's men's original program.

The Washington Huskies landed one football player, but lost another. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Mincey, a cornerback from Pasadena City College, has told the Huskies 
he plans to sign a letter of intent Feb. 8 to play football for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Glen Cavanaugh, a 6-foot-4, 265-pound lineman from Gonzaga Prep High School 
in Spokane, said he will attend Stanford University, the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer reported today. Washington and Washington State both 
recruited Cavanaugh. 
</P>
<P>
Mincey, who prepped at Los Angeles' Dorsey High School, also was recruited by 
UCLA, USC, Pittsburgh and Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies rarely recruit junior college football players. They've signed only 
six transfers, three of them kickers, in the last seven seasons.

RACE BOARD CHIEF CONFLICT ALLEGED

The chairman of the California Horse Racing Board is an executive for the firm 
that insures one of the race tracks licensed by the board, but he has not 
listed that on his conflict-of-interest statements, The Sacramento Bee reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Liscom is a senior vice president of Oland International Co., a Los 
Angeles insurance brokerage that is paid more than $1 million in annual 
premiums by Hollywood Park Operating Co., which runs races at Los Alamitos Race 
Track in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Liscom told the newspaper that he was not required to disclose the association. 
He said he has nothing to do with the Hollywood Park policy and has an attorney 
general's opinion relating to his previous employment saying he did not need to 
report the connection. 
</P>
<P>
As a governor's appointee, Liscom is required to file an annual report listing 
his sources of income and gifts with the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
His 1987-88 statement does not list his firm's relationship with the track. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Olson, a Sacramento attorney representing the board in a lawsuit brought 
by a harness race horse organization, said Liscom sought an attorney general's 
opinion on an identical situation shortly after his 1984 appointment, when he 
worked for another firm that had a race track policy. That opinion said he did 
not have to disclose the relationship because he was only an employee of the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I have had no conflict of interest whatsoever," Liscom told The 
Bee. "Integrity and ethics have always been important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Franchetti, who is representing the harness race horse organization, 
said the association is significant. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear to us there is a clear conflict that should have been 
declared," Franchetti said.
