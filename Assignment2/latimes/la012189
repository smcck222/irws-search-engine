Looks like the petition is mightier than the magnum. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Alliance for Survival -- the folks who trade teddy bears for toy 
guns -- took offense at a vast sign above a Venice boardwalk clothing store 
that shows a hooded man leveling a handgun of anti-aircraft caliber at a target 
that seems unsettlingly like whoever happens to be looking at the sign. 
</P>
<P>
The sign at the Local Heroes shop struck alliance director Jerry Rubin as "a 
very violent and negative message . . . that if you wanna be a local hero, pick 
up a gun and start firing it." 
</P>
<P>
Someone had already taken up the challenge and played fast-draw, pocking the 
sign with bullet holes. "That proves my point," says Rubin, "that violence 
begets violence." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Rubin evidently begot what he wanted: action. After the alliance 
began circulating petitions outside the store to have the sign modified, the 
owner agreed to "alter" it within a week. Says manager Molly Monjauze, "It will 
be toned down." 
</P>
<P>
Three or four decades ago, it was the stuff your mother swore you must have 
lost, when in fact she had just gotten tired of cleaning it up, and threw it 
away on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's under glass at a new Melrose gallery, at prices that would make Mom 
drop her Electrolux: Jiminy Cricket bubble gum, a Captain Marvel tie clip, a 
Howdy Doody record player and Li'l Abner barrettes, all the ephemera of 60 
years of cartoons and comics. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Bernie Shine finally decided to clean his house. 
</P>
<P>
The devoted "Mickeyologist" turned his private mania into the Shine Gallery, 
shelf and wall space for his 20 years of cartoon collectibles in every medium: 
chalk, plastic, paper, tin, Bakelite, ceramic. 
</P>
<P>
Much opening-night chatter was the gnashing of teeth by people who had once 
owned "one of those" and cursed their housecleaning impulses. An Ingersoll 
"Three Little Pigs" watch, originally about $5, commanded more than $1,000, and 
a little 1922 Toonerville Trolley, the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks, was 
priced at $750. You could, however, snag a ceramic Bambi for as little as 40 
bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Ron and Nancy might have thought they were leaving politics behind when they 
moved to St. Cloud Road in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong-o. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath, running against his former colleague Zev Yaroslavsky in the 5th 
City Council District, played neighborly host and canny politician with a gift 
and a campaign pitch to the Reagans before the Reagans even got here. 
</P>
<P>
Thwarted by security, McGrath was forced to mail what he wanted to 
hand-deliver: a couple of pine seedlings, a case of Stolichnaya vodka -- now a 
politically correct beverage -- and a letter that read in part: 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome home to California and to the 5th Council District . . . I am from the 
Valley side of the district, the side chosen by Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, 
by Tom Selleck and Bob Hope. . . .Your interests are now my interests. As your 
councilman, I would work to see to it for instance that tour buses are kept off 
the streets where you and your neighbors live." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath is sure the Reagans would drink to that proposal -- with or without 
Stolichnaya.

AL MARTINEZ: TEARS FOR A DREAM IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man called Rodriguez flew out of Los Angeles on Thursday to live in Spain, 
leaving behind a driveway stained with his wife's blood and the angry memory of 
an episode of brutality that transformed their dream into a nightmare. 
"Criminals took our future," he said to me the day he left, "and they tore it 
to shreds. I don't know if we'll ever come back." And then he cried. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez isn't his real name. He was afraid to have me use it, he said, 
because he still has relatives living in America and doesn't want them hurt, an 
irony not lost in a nation long glorified as a haven for the oppressed. You 
might recognize his real name if you heard it. He was a soccer star for 20 
years in Latin America and Spain, and at his retirement was being paid $1 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
After months of searching, Rodriguez bought a house in an affluent area of the 
San Fernando Valley and took a year to turn its 6,000 square feet into the kind 
of home he had always wanted for his family. They moved in two days before 
Christmas: Rodriguez, his wife, a teen-age daughter and a younger son. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where we would stay," he said in a voice that trembled. "This is where 
we would put down roots." But on Thursday, Jan. 12, on a driveway that has come 
to symbolize his family's anguish, the dream died. It was only 20 days old. 
</P>
<P>
We'll call his wife Elana. She left their dream house at 2 in the afternoon to 
shop and meet their daughter. Rodriguez was visiting friends. Later, he would 
pick up a car that had been shipped from Spain. Colombian-born, he had lived in 
the United States for 22 years but also held Spanish citizenship to play for 
Spain's national team, a situation that kept him continually on the road. But 
now all the wandering, all the road trips, all the instability was over. They 
were family again. They were home. 
</P>
<P>
Elana parked her 1987 Mercedes in the driveway. She and Maria, 16, were about 
to get out of their car when both doors were abruptly jerked open. Two men in 
their 20s pulled them onto the driveway, grabbed their purses, ripped off their 
jewelry, punched Maria once and began a vicious and unprovoked beating of her 
mother. Not a word was said. They took the Mercedes and left Elana unconscious 
on the driveway, her blood staining the concrete. Maria screamed, "They've 
killed my mother!" 
</P>
<P>
Both women suffered concussions. Maria's eye was blackened and an ear torn when 
her earrings were ripped off. Elana's shoulder was dislocated by the fists that 
pounded her with lunatic frenzy. Rodriguez says there wasn't six square inches 
of her body that wasn't bruised. "'When I got to the hospital, the first thing 
she said to me was 'Let's get out of this country.' " 
</P>
<P>
Elana was hospitalized for three days. On the day of her release, she and their 
two children left for Spain. They never set foot in their dream house again. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez went back to the house last Sunday. He saw his wife's blood on the 
driveway, like crimson patterns of evil etched in concrete. "I went crazy," he 
said. "I smashed doors, I kicked walls. When I left, I knew I would never go 
back to that house again. I had movers take everything and ship it to Spain. I 
gave the keys to my brother. I don't care what he does with the house. The 
dream is over." 
</P>
<P>
In two hours Rodriguez would catch a plane to Madrid. Would he ever return to 
America? Had the violence against his wife and daughter translated to hate for 
the country he once loved? There were tears in his eyes, but his jaw was set in 
anger. They would surely come back to visit relatives, but as for living in 
America again . . ." I don't know," he said. "I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
What he hates is not the country. "There is crime all over the world," he said. 
"We are just another statistic. I don't accuse the United States. I accuse 
those men who took my future in this country away from me." 
</P>
<P>
The tendency is to mock a rich man fleeing from an incident that most likely 
will never be repeated; to chide him for so hastily abandoning the dream of a 
lifetime, like a soldier surrendering a hard-won mountain top. But who am I to 
judge the depth of his family's terror? Fear, someone wrote, leaves a rusty 
taste, and anyone who has ever been afraid, either for himself or for someone 
he loves, knows how long the taste can last. 
</P>
<P>
I keep thinking about the stains of blood on the driveway and the tears 
Rodriguez shed for his dream in America. In ways we may never understand, he 
cries for us all.

 PLANE ON WAY TO L.A. LOSES WING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A panel broke off the left wing of a Los Angeles-bound Boeing 757 after 
takeoff, forcing the Eastern Airlines flight to return to Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 105 passengers or crew of six was injured, said Robin Matell, an 
Eastern spokesman in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The plane left Atlanta at 8:04 p.m. Thursday and was near Birmingham, Ala., 
when the pilot noticed the problem, said Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It was climbing at 28,000 feet and the captain felt a shudder and heard a 
noise," Matell said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane returned to the Atlanta airport an hour later, Matell said, and the 
passengers were transferred to another flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern is investigating the incident to try to determine what caused it," 
Matell said. "We'll keep the plane out of service until we find out exactly 
what happened."

BOND PROPOSAL WOULD PUT SALES TAX TO WORK SOONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A regional commission charged with spending $2.25 billion in sales tax revenue 
to upgrade the county's transportation system on Friday proposed a financing 
plan that would accelerate construction of the improvements and save more than 
$282 million. 
</P>
<P>
The plan could speed up construction of the regionwide transportation network 
improvements by three years, and could accelerate some major projects by as 
many as six years, said San Diego City Councilman Ed Struiksma, a member of the 
San Diego County Regional Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
A financial analysis conducted for the commission recommends that it sell bonds 
to raise money for early construction of some large, expensive projects. 
Revenue from the half-cent sales tax increase authorized by voters in November, 
1987, would be used to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Would Increase Cost 
</P>
<P>
In research conducted for the sales tax hike referendum, "the overwhelming 
consensus of cities and towns was that, in those instances where we could 
provide capital improvements -- freeways, roads -- ahead of time, we should 
bond," Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on the borrowed money would increase the cost of the projects by $116 
million, from $1.612 billion to $1.728 billion, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
But freeway users would save $298.8 million from reduced congestion delays, 
$45.3 million by traveling on more direct routes and $54.3 million from the 
lower accident rate that would result by shifting motorists off local roads and 
onto freeways, according to the analysis. Total savings after the $116-million 
cost is subtracted would be $282.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also would save money under the plan by building projects 
earlier, before prices for construction and materials rose, Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 64% of the projects would be built on a pay-as-you-go basis, while 36% 
would be constructed with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Proposition A, the referendum authorized a half-cent sales tax 
increase for 20 years, raising the county sales tax to 6.5%. A subsequent 
half-cent tax hike approved in June to finance jail construction raised the 
sales tax to 7% on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition A revenue is to be split three ways to pay for local street, 
freeway and public transit improvements. Some major projects it will finance 
include the construction of 8.6 miles of California 52 from Tierrasanta to 
Santee, and a six-mile Mission Valley trolley line from San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium to La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is composed of each city's representative to the San 
Diego Assn. of Governments, will meet Friday to decide whether to distribute 
the financing plan for review by governmental agencies countywide.

INMATES CAN GET ABORTION WITHOUT COURT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inmates at the County Jail at Las Colinas will be able to obtain abortions 
without getting a court order first, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said 
Friday in announcing a change in the old policy that required women to pay for 
the surgery and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Alan Fulmer said the new policy, which became effective this week, will 
also make it possible for the county to pick up the cost of the procedure for 
women who cannot afford it. Under the previous policy, an inmate had to obtain 
a court order and pay for the abortion and the time incurred by deputies 
assigned to accompany her to the hospital or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The change was necessary in order to bring the county and Sheriff's Department 
into compliance with existing law and court decisions, Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping in line with court decisions on abortion. A review of current 
court cases showed that we were not in compliance with the law," he said. " . . 
. Under the old policy, we viewed abortion more like elective surgery . . . and 
not recognized as something that we had to pay for." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fulmer, abortion demands have not been a major issue at the 
women's jail. A quick check of its medical records showed that, last year, 
authorities received only one request for an abortion, Fulmer said, and that 
inmate decided not to go through with it. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors will be made available to inmates who request abortions, he said, 
adding that the official jail policy will not be to encourage abortions, but to 
make inmates aware of all of the options available to them.

COUPLE IN LA JOLLA CRY FOUL OVER STATE DENIAL OF ELDERLY-CARE LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary O'Rourke has her Irish up over governmental bureaucracy in general and 
over the people in particular who have labeled her gracious home "unfit" and 
claimed she's running the "Worst Little Boarding House in La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, she claims, state officials are trying to run her out of business 
so that her "guests" will be forced to move to the large, new nursing homes 
that have opened in recent years and are lacking patients. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke and her husband, Raymond, opened O'Rourke Residential Care Home in the 
shadow of the posh La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club in 1975 and, for five years, 
did a thriving business in caring for the elderly under a residential care home 
license. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambulances Not Welcomed 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that her enterprise creates a bit of disruption in the quiet 
La Jolla Shores neighborhood just a block or so from the palm-lined beach. The 
inevitable emergency ambulance arrivals in the wee hours of the night haven't 
been welcomed on the otherwise-quiet Lowry Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
There's no love lost between O'Rourke and her neighbors, but she says she has 
no proof that they are using their considerable influence to prevent her from 
running her care home. 
</P>
<P>
"There's another Mary O'Rourke living around here," she said. "Maybe they have 
the two of us mixed up. Maybe we are being blamed for things that she did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, O'Rourke said, the state Department of Social Services took over from 
the county the enforcement of licensing for residential care homes, and she 
found herself in instant trouble. But state officials say they have always 
issued the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a teacher of handicapped children before I retired and had thought to 
open my home to them," O'Rourke said. But county welfare officials urged her to 
turn her energies to the elderly because of the great need for small, 
neighborhood-based care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
When the state took over the inspections and licensing, O'Rourke said, she 
found that her spacious La Jolla Shores residence wasn't up to par, despite its 
million-dollar view and its half-acre of pines and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewal Refused 
</P>
<P>
When her license came up for renewal in November, 1981, the state inspectors 
refused to grant her another. Since then, O'Rourke said, "I've been harassed 
and driven crazy by inspectors and court hearings and such." 
</P>
<P>
In the seven years since she lost her license, O'Rourke has continued to care 
for elderly people in her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I rent rooms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
State licensing inspectors say a residential care home, by any other name, is 
still a care home when its guests require aid in everyday activities such as 
dressing, walking or maintaining cleanliness. And a residential care home 
requires a state license. 
</P>
<P>
Mary O'Rourke now has as guests a woman, bright-eyed and cheerful, who will 
soon celebrate her 102nd birthday, and another elderly roomer in her 80s, a 
former dancer and the spitting image of Martha Graham, who is confined to a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"We had seven fire inspections one year, when there is only supposed to be 
one," O'Rourke complained. "They want us to have an 8-foot-wide hallway. Who 
has an 8-foot-wide hallway? And why?" 
</P>
<P>
Licensing inspectors visited the O'Rourke home this week, asking the elderly 
guests whether they were happy, asking them if they knew what day it was and 
where they were. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets my guests terribly, and those people shouldn't be coming out here 
while this matter is in court," O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Delmast of the state licensing office in San Diego differs with O'Rourke's 
assessment. It is the care that the elderly are, or are not, receiving that is 
causing the state to try to close down the O'Rourkes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hersant, the licensing office bureau chief, agrees. It is not the sumptuous 
surroundings that do not measure up, it is the level of care required by the 
O'Rourkes' tenants. And these elderly people require aid that is not being 
provided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Sanders, the state deputy attorney general who has been trying to shut 
down the O'Rourkes' care home for more than three years, said the battle has 
been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state denied renewal of the license in 1981, he explained, the 
actual closure order was not issued until Sept. 6, 1985, because of appeals 
filed by the O'Rourkes' son, Albert. 
</P>
<P>
"Most families, confronted with the inevitable, would have given up and found 
some other way to earn a living. But not the O'Rourkes," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
After the O'Rourkes continued to operate a residential care home despite a 
court injunction against it, Sanders filed a criminal contempt-of-court 
complaint against them. 
</P>
<P>
During the contempt hearings, Judge Richard Huffman -- then a Superior Court 
judge who has since been elevated to the appellate bench -- became concerned 
that Mary O'Rourke was mentally incapable of understanding the charges against 
her and ordered her to submit to a psychiatric examination, which she failed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge declared a mistrial and ordered a re-examination of O'Rourke in six 
months. Earlier this month, attorney Albert O'Rourke said his mother had not 
kept the appointment for a re-examination in December because she was 
physically unable to. Superior Court Judge Michael Greer set a new examination 
date for Feb. 3 and continued the case until March 7, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, O'Rourke continues to play hostess to her elderly guests, 
convinced that she, not the state, knows how to keep them healthy and happy. 
</P>
<P>
For $65 a day, she is supplying a fine home, plenty of food, lots of tender 
loving care to her guests, she claimed, and "I don't think the state has any 
right to stop me."

A one-time Jewish presence in China, notably in Shanghai, will be relived this 
Passover season in a visit mixed with nostalgic and business motives. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Abner Weiss of Beverly Hills' Beth Jacob Congregation was recently in 
China to finish arrangements to serve kosher food at the upcoming International 
Assembly of Jews in China, to be held April 18-23. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the event say it indicates that the Chinese government's desire 
to attract international investment and business from Jewish communities. Yosef 
Tekoah, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and a one-time Shanghai 
resident, said the return trip will be "a tangible restatement of our faith in 
Jewish survival and our friendship toward China." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that China does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, the 
event is "a welcome development," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The first modern Jewish settlement in the country was in Shanghai in the 19th 
Century, mostly by Iraqi Jews seeking new business opportunities. The Jewish 
population in the city swelled to more than 20,000 during the pre-World War II 
flight of refugees from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings once important to the Jewish settlement will be identified by signs 
during the visit. The group will also visit Beijing.

The Rev. Stanley E. Olson, the last Los Angeles-based bishop of the old

in Santa Barbara. The church is a 350-member congregation of the new 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Olson was not elected a bishop when the 
Lutheran Church in America merged with two other denominations in 1987. Olson 
will be installed as pastor March 12.

RACIAL GAP: LINGERING PROBLEM FOR BLACKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Socially, Color Line Is Still Drawn in Nation's Capital," Part 
I, Jan. 17: 
</P>
<P>
Why is it called apartheid when we talk about it happening in South Africa and 
apartness when we talk about racial divisions in "Chocolate City," the capital 
of the United States? And what, exactly, is the difference? Do we accept a lame 
explanation, such as voluntary versus involuntary segregation because many 
black Americans supposedly say they choose not to mingle with whites? 
</P>
<P>
As to the "courageous" order by Gov. Michael Dukakis to the Massachusetts 
executive branch to stop making purchases from companies with ties to South 
Africa, will he also order them to stop dealing with companies based in 
Washington, the city he would have loved to reside in?

<TEXT>

Reagan's farewell speech was a masterpiece of deception filled with hypocrisy. 
He failed to mention the scandals in his Administration, how he has been 
anti-labor, restricted civil rights, ignored the homeless, supported cuts in 
Medicare, VA, education, health and child care programs, tax increases for the 
middle class, surtax on senior citizens receiving Medicare, curtailed 
information to the media and finally approved the 50% pay raises which boosts 
his own pension -- in addition to the $49,000 pension he receives from 
California. I say: Good riddance!

Two articles caught my eye on Jan. 15. One was "Security Guards Seal Off 
Anti-Apartheid Students" (Metro). "Thirty high school and junior high school 
students spent the second day of a sit-in Saturday at the South African 
Consulate in Beverly Hills protesting anti-apartheid policies." One student 
stated, "All of us feel strongly that what's going on in South Africa is 
unacceptable by any human standards." 
</P>
<P>
Another article on the front page, "Jim Crow's Ghost Lurks in New South," 
stated Atlanta is split almost in half racially. The city's public schools, 
with a 92% black student enrollment, are among the most segregated in the 
nation. Also economic discrimination is one of the most persistent forms of 
anti-black prejudice in the South. 
</P>
<P>
Many other forms of racial discrimination were covered in this excellent 
article. I respectfully submit: Let's clean up our own racial discrimination 
mess in the U.S. first. After we clean up our own back yard, let us turn out 
attention to South Africa's problems.

PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Reagan presidency should be judged on the basis of Reagan's goals and of 
those who share his political philosophy. Black leaders give Reagan a failing 
grade, because he has opposed many social programs that they favor. Leaders of 
women's organizations give Reagan a failing grade, because he has opposed 
abortion, comparable worth, and the equal rights amendment. Other critics 
include supporters of gay rights, who accuse Reagan of ignoring the AIDS 
epidemic, and pacifists, who favored a nuclear freeze when Reagan was sending 
missiles to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
I don't recall President Reagan running for office as a feminist, a gay rights 
activist, or an advocate of more social welfare spending. Reagan's political 
agenda can be summed up by four goals: (1) cut taxes, (2) build up our 
military, (3) appoint conservative judges, and (4) slow the tide toward a 
welfare state. He's been crusading on behalf of these positions since he 
campaigned for Barry Goldwater in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Under Reagan, the top tax rate has gone from 70% to 33%. Our military buildup, 
including the installation of nuclear missiles in Europe, has reversed Soviet 
expansionism and led to the INF agreement. Three conservatives have been added 
to the U.S. Supreme Court and a fourth has been elevated to chief justice; he's 
appointed approximately 50% of our other federal judges. Even the deficit, 
which President Reagan sees as his greatest failure, will prove to be an ally 
in the fight against an ever expanding welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said of his Presidency, " . . . Not bad, not bad at all." Even 
in his self-evaluation, he was conservative. He deserves an A.

PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his farewell address, President Reagan's closing comments concern the view 
from his White House window. He sees a "shining city on the hill . . . more 
prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago." 
</P>
<P>
In easy sight of the White House are people living in the park; Washington has 
achieved the "honor" of being No. 1 in violent deaths, due, no doubt, to the 
huge increase of drug use in that city. 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to have the name of the stuff they use to clean the White House 
windows.

RACIAL GAP: LINGERING PROBLEM FOR BLACKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The articles by Times staff writers Lee May ("Stereotypes Haunt Black 
Achievement," Part I, Jan. 9) and Ron Harris ("Minorities in TV: Black, White 
Issue," Part I, Jan. 11) spotlight the lingering problem of racism in our 
country. Such exposure of the prejudices and intolerance toward other human 
beings was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
What those very timely articles may have done is to rouse the conscience of 
those who are the staunchest racists but who will never admit it. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite true as they acknowledge, great strides have been made since 
slavery and the beginning of this century, especially during the civil rights 
movement and remedial legislation; nevertheless, we have a long way to go 
before the stigma of racism can be significantly remedied in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is deserving of praise for featuring those articles on the front 
page. If other publications do half as much to contribute toward the solution 
of this complex problem, within the next decade or two, we may witness a nation 
which has conquered one of the vices which has caused much pain and human 
suffering in our country. I hope and pray that the above will be accomplished. 
Genuine racial harmony may become a reality.

PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gimme that ol' time religion" with its thumping music and its sportive 
apostasy, kept running through my head as I watched President Reagan recite his 
final address lines (Part I, Jan. 12). 
</P>
<P>
Again he pointed upward to the shining house, or city, on a hill, i.e. heaven. 
But our weary priest had recited his well-worn catechism all too often. And his 
tone was more querulous than convincing. He climbs no hills. Perhaps his words 
were designed only to catch the last of the unwary, the remaining true-blue 
believers. Perhaps it was just an exercise in pure nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps he should have left us with only that -- the shining city as 
stand-in for the sunset our hero and heroine now ride into -- but he didn't. He 
went querulously on to excuses, redrafted as boasts, for his performance as 
President. What he had done, in summary, was to propagandize a threat which 
didn't exist, to build a war machine we couldn't afford and which endangered 
the lives and health of Americans it was designed to "protect," which reduced 
industrial America to second or third place in the world and which exacerbated 
the dislocations in a society increasingly run for an irresponsible elite. 
</P>
<P>
But the boasts were real enough: His Administration has created 19 million jobs 
-- "We've learned to service Japanese cars," it's said -- and we are respected 
around the world -- meaning our warships and gunships can anywhere and threaten 
anyone, other than one of the great powers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course he is defensive. Prof. Paul Kennedy's perceptive book, "The Rise and 
Fall of the Great Powers," is available somewhere in the White House, and it 
begs for an answer. We are dismantling our power while seeming to build it up 
exactly as the British, Spanish, Dutch, etc. did before us, writes Kennedy. In 
the face of these ineluctables Reagan's assurance that present policies are to 
continue is hardly a reassurance. Our spree is over. It's Monday morning in 
America.

DRUG CENTER MAY HAVE TO UNDERGO SITE IMPACT STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a six-hour public hearing on locating the Nancy Reagan Center for 
drug-abuse treatment in Lake View Terrace, a Los Angeles zoning official 
appeared to be leaning toward ordering an extensive review of the project's 
potential effect on the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to me that there is a lot of confusion and a lot of 
misunderstanding about this project," said Darryl L. Fisher, associate zoning 
administrator. "I have to consider if it wouldn't be possible that an 
environmental impact report would resolve a lot of those questions." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he will decide within two weeks whether to require the report, 
which would delay the project several months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Open in Spring 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Phoenix House, the nonprofit company proposing the center, said 
they want to open the facility by spring because the former First Lady is back 
in California. She would have an office at the center, but her duties have not 
been announced. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi said during the hearing that he will ask the City 
Council on Tuesday to require the environmental study. Fisher said he will 
determine the feelings of the council before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people attended Friday's hearing at the Lake View Terrace Recreation 
Center, more than half of them supporters of the center who wore yellow buttons 
that read "Save Kids." Most of the supporters were clients, counselors or 
teachers from other Phoenix House programs -- in Santa Ana and Venice -- who 
were bused in for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Also among them were a sprinkling of San Fernando Valley residents who have 
decided to support the center. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Nobles, managing partner of the Van Nuys-Pierce Park apartments in 
Pacoima, said that although his efforts to clean up the area's drug and crime 
problems have helped, "we need Phoenix House. What we are doing is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Finn, widow of Councilman Howard Finn, who represented Lake View Terrace, 
said that during tours of other Phoenix House centers, she was impressed with 
how grown-up and clean-cut the youngsters were. 
</P>
<P>
"If only we could have such a haven for cure as Phoenix House on every block," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
When Pacoima public-housing advocate Mary Cooley heard about plans for the 
center, she was against it. But she said she changed her mind after her 
drug-addicted daughter was referred to the Phoenix House facility in Turlock by 
Mayor Tom Bradley's Valley assistant, Doris (Dodo) Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sometimes a lot of us operate out of fear instead of out of reason," 
Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters emphasized Phoenix House's track record in other locations and the 
need for in-patient drug treatment in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said there are blemishes on that record and noted that the hospital 
site is within 25 yards of homes. They also noted that the site is on the edge 
of an already drug- and crime-riddled area. 
</P>
<P>
They said the northeast Valley shoulders more than its share of halfway houses, 
juvenile detention centers and sanitariums. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reached the point of saturation where this community is about to give 
up . . . and stop fighting," said Fred Taylor, political adviser to the 
Minister's Fellowship of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inappropriate Use 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said an environmental study would prove that the center is an 
inappropriate use of the former Lake View Medical Center site. 
</P>
<P>
But Phoenix House representatives said that while they do not welcome the 
additional expenditure of time and money that such a study would require, they 
believe that it would vindicate them. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental study would only mean "there's going to be a period of time 
where we're saying the same thing we're saying now, just in greater detail," 
said Larraine Mohr, senior vice president for Phoenix House's California 
properties. "There is no environmental impact of this facility." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney George J. Mihlsten said the center would generate far less traffic and 
other nuisances than the Lake View Medical Center did before it closed three 
years ago. Mihlsten, known as one of City Hall's most effective lobbyists, said 
he is representing Phoenix House at no charge because he believes in its cause.

KORENSTEIN ASKS IRS INQUIRY INTO FUNDAMENTALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein said Friday that she will ask 
the Internal Revenue Service to investigate a tax-exempt fundamentalist group 
to see if it is illegally using donations to defeat her. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, who faces eight challengers for her West San Fernando Valley seat, 
called the California Coalition of Traditional Values a group of "right-wing 
fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members said earlier this week that they have targeted Korenstein for 
defeat because of her support of a counseling program, called Project 10, for 
gay and lesbian students as well as her support for the district's three 
school-based health clinics that dispense birth control devices and 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"Their goal is to impose their narrow extremist morality upon our nation by 
force of law," Korenstein told a news conference at her district office. She 
said involvement by the group in the campaign "goes against the separation of 
church and state." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition founder Louis Sheldon said Friday that the Orange County-based 
organization, which opened an office in Van Nuys last year, has not violated 
any laws and plans only to provide information on candidates to members of more 
than 50 fundamentalist congregations in the West Valley. Sheldon, a registered 
Sacramento lobbyist and veteran demonstrator against gay rights, dismissed 
claims that groups outside the Valley will interfere in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only educate those in the Valley; we cannot endorse or oppose," Sheldon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein called for all candidates to reject involvement with the coalition. 
She said support of the coalition is more likely to hurt than help candidates 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
But candidate Barbara Romey said she hopes to gain from the group's involvement 
in the race. Earlier this week, Romey said she believed that West Valley 
constituents favor a return to "traditional values." 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone picks me because they like my principles and ethics, then I want 
their support," Romey said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said he met Romey during a protest against Project 10 and believes that 
she "has more interest in family values" than Korenstein. He said he has not 
met Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Romey lost to Korenstein in a bitter 1987 campaign to complete the term of 
board member David Armor, who resigned. 
</P>
<P>
She opposes both the Project 10 counseling program and the dispensing of birth 
control at school health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein on Friday defended her support of the two programs. Counseling is 
needed for students facing a variety of adolescent problems, including gangs, 
drugs and questions of sexual preference, she said. She supports the health 
clinics, including one at San Fernando High School, because parental consent is 
required before students can obtain birth control devices, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon said his group has not targeted school board President Roberta 
Weintraub, the East Valley board representative who also supports the two 
programs and is up for reelection in April, because her challengers do not 
share the group's view as closely as Romey does.

AGOURA BAND HELPS HAIL THE FORMER CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan probably wasn't humming "California Here I Come" 
when the last strains of "Hail to the Chief" faded Friday and he departed 
Washington with a round of emotional goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of Agoura teen-agers helped make certain Reagan heard the 
California tune after he arrived in Los Angeles to start his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura High School band got last-minute marching orders to help welcome 
Reagan back to California by serenading him with the tune and several other 
songs in welcoming ceremonies as he and his wife, Nancy, arrived at Los Angeles 
International Airport. Also on hand were the USC Marching Band, a Salvation 
Army band and a Mexican-style mariachi band. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 excited musicians, flag twirlers and pompon girls hastily learned on 
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning how to perform the Marine and Navy hymns 
and the "Eagle Squadron Parade March." 
</P>
<P>
They said the fact that Reagan once owned a ranch a few miles from their school 
had nothing to do with their invitation; neither was the fact that Reagan 
started his political career by winning a post on the soil conservation 
district that serves the Agoura area. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that a coordinator of the welcoming ceremonies, producer Jerry 
Naylor, lives in Agoura and has heard the band play, said Agoura High 
bandmaster John Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a unique situation," Mosley said. "They were going to just have college 
bands, but somebody said, 'Why not have a high school band?' " The invitation 
was extended Sunday, he said, but the band did not receive a music list until 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor, a former rock 'n' roller who became the lead singer of The Crickets 
after Buddy Holly died in a 1959 plane crash, is a veteran Republican Party 
campaign worker. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 invited guests attended the airport reception. After meeting with 
Mayor Tom Bradley, actor Robert Stack and others, the Reagans where whisked by 
motorcade to their new home in exclusive Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a bittersweet several hours this day," Reagan told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Before landing, Reagan told reporters aboard an Air Force plane that "it was 
hard to say goodby" after eight years as president.

It wasn't hard for the USC band to say goodby to the Agoura High Band after the

HILLSIDE HOUSES ON POLES; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING BAN SOUGHT TO PROTECT 'STILT STREET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A fragile neighborhood of stilt houses in Sherman Oaks that rode out 
Wednesday's earthquake received support Friday against a different upheaval: 
intense land development around it. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky called for a moratorium on 
construction of large houses on Oakfield Drive near a world-famous row of 
houses that are perched on poles above a steep canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they will decide next week whether to ask city planners to 
slap strict controls on the hilly site, which is visible to thousands of 
motorists who travel daily on Beverly Glen Boulevard between the San Fernando 
Valley and Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 20 stilt houses and others who consider the eye-catching row a 
Los Angeles architectural landmark have sought such protection since a 
developer began building large, conventional houses on small, empty Oakfield 
Drive lots eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that huge homes on 20 leftover lots would overwhelm the 
neighborhood and destroy the architectural integrity of the area, known to 
outsiders as "Stilt Street." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this helps save this mountainside," stilt-house owner Virginia Hadfield 
said Friday. "I hope the moratorium will do what it sounds like it will do." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky asked that the city prohibit new houses taller than 30 feet and 
require side-yard and front-yard setbacks of at least five feet. He also asked 
for a ban on new houses that cover more than half of their lots. 
</P>
<P>
Building rules, Yaroslavsky said, "have resulted in the development of homes 
out of scale for the hillside community in which they are built." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Krotinger, an aide to Yaroslavsky, said the moratorium proposal will 
undergo four public hearings during the next several months before it comes up 
for a final City Council vote. She said a one-year moratorium would give city 
planners time to decide if permanent controls are needed to preserve the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The one-of-a-kind neighborhood was designed by architect Richard J. Neutra and 
was built in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the stilt houses have been featured in movies and television shows, 
usually as examples of the ultimate in wacky Los Angeles architecture. 
</P>
<P>
But Neutra's pole design is viewed as anything but frivolous by architectural 
experts, conservationists and those who live in the 40-by-50-foot, one-level 
homes that are suspended 30 feet above a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimum of Grading 
</P>
<P>
The stilt houses were built with a minimum of grading and designed to blend 
into the oak-studded canyon that extends more than a mile south of the Ventura 
Freeway, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are integrated into the hillside and into nature," stilt-house owner 
Steve Sadd said Friday. "This is a geologically unstable area. We're very 
pleased with what happened today. We think it will ultimately benefit everybody 
by preserving a scenic area." 
</P>
<P>
Sadd said the small lots on the hillside are left over from a 1930s-era 
subdivision. A housing tract begun today in the area would have far fewer lots 
on the same acreage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Ralph Lewis said he was disappointed that the city did not act sooner 
to protect the area. He said vibrations from recent excavation work and 
construction trucks have already damaged some of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just finished patching cracks in my walls caused by the trucks on 
Wednesday, the day of the earthquake," Lewis said. "Afterward I checked and 
none of the cracks had reopened." 
</P>
<P>
That's proof, Lewis said, that man is a bigger threat to Stilt Street than 
Mother Nature.

An alleged gunman wounded by San Diego police in a K mart store in Scripps 
Ranch pleaded innocent Friday to several charges. 
</P>
<P>
A wheelchair-bound Ben Perrin, 24, is accused of shooting a police dog Nov. 15 
and exhibiting a weapon in a threatening manner. A SWAT team was called after 
the gunman held police at bay for more than nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
Perrin was shot repeatedly by police after he allegedly shot the dog, which 
attacked and bit him. He has been in the hospital since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick set a preliminary hearing for Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick set bail at $50,000 but ordered a bail-review hearing for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
During the November confrontation, Perrin allegedly grabbed a .22-caliber rifle 
from K mart shelves and loaded the gun with his ammunition. He did not take any 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The store and 11 others in the shopping center on Mira Mesa Boulevard were 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Perrin was reportedly upset over breaking up with his girlfriend and said at 
the scene that he wanted to commit suicide.

Police arrested a teen-ager in connection with a series of downtown stabbings 
Thursday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Elias Belasco Florez, 19, was among a group of three to seven teen-agers who 
allegedly attacked three men between 9 and 9:30 p.m. outside the Carl's Jr. 
restaurant at 401 Broadway, across from Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. the group allegedly attacked Damaja Cumberland, 18, stabbing him 
three times in the chest, lower left abdomen and left leg, police said. 
Cumberland was in good condition Friday at Mercy Hospital, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, police said the same group attacked Troy Edward Barnett, 
age unknown, stabbing him in the left thigh as he tried to enter the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:20 p.m., police said, the group attacked William Deebs, 25, who was being 
punched as officers. Deebs was stabbed once in the upper left back. 
</P>
<P>
Florez is being held in County Jail in lieu of $10,500 bail. Police believe the 
stabbings were gang-related and are seeking other suspects.

Special-circumstances allegations that could bring the death penalty were filed 
Friday against a parolee charged with killing a 17-year-old girl in a vacant 
house in East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Ray Roberts Jr., 33, is accused of strangling Melissa Orchulli on July 
12. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Denise McGuire said she will seek the death penalty against 
Roberts if he is convicted of first-degree murder. McGuire said the special 
circumstances allege that the murder occurred during the commission of a sex 
crime and a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts will be arraigned Wednesday, when a trial date will be set. 
</P>
<P>
Orchulli was a 10th-grader at Twain Eastern Satellite, a continuation school. 
Her body was discovered by a prospective renter of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Several teen-age girls testified at Roberts' preliminary hearing that he 
approached them and asked to take photos of them. The girls said they refused 
to go into the vacant house. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who is back in custody, was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon 
in 1986.

AGOURA HILLS MAN HELD AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura Hills man led sheriff's deputies, California Highway Patrol officers 
and two police helicopters on a wild, hourlong chase that ended when the man 
rammed his car into a patrol car after he had been cornered on a dead-end 
street, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Carlton Webb, 29, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon -- his car -- on a police officer, reckless driving, drunk driving and 
evading arrest, Deputy Dan Cox said Friday. Webb was jailed at the department's 
Malibu station in lieu of $8,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started about 9 p.m. Thursday near Reyes Adobe Road in Agoura Hills 
when deputies spotted a car speeding on the Ventura Freeway at more than 100 
m.p.h., Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
For 62 minutes, the car weaved through Agoura Hills, Thousand Oaks, Westlake 
Village, Woodland Hills and Calabasas before entering a dead-end road in 
Topanga Canyon, police said. Trapped, the driver shifted his car into reverse 
and rammed a sheriff's patrol car, damaging the front end. 
</P>
<P>
Webb got out of the car and swung at one of the deputies, Cox said. Webb was 
subdued, handcuffed and taken to the sheriff's station in Malibu.

THOMPSON'S WALKOUT DOES NOT GENERATE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though I support the position of John Thompson and others who say that 
(college-entrance) tests discriminate against the lower socioeconomic athlete, 
I am angry at statements, made by many coaches, that show bias against the 
community colleges. For example, some coaches have complained that "Kids will 
be forced to go the junior college route." 
</P>
<P>
It is well documented that some of the finest teaching in the country (that's 
teaching, not research) is done at the community college level.

Proposal 42 should be used to penalize schools -- not athletes. In this way, if 
a school graduated a specified percentage of Prop. 48 student/athletes (try 
75%), then the school would be allowed to give scholarships to Prop. 48 
students. 
</P>
<P>
But if a school failed to graduate that specified percentage of Prop. 48 
students, it would be relegated to Proposal 42 status (meaning no scholarships 
for those students who do not meet academic requirements.) 
</P>
<P>
The only loser then is the coach who is more concerned with wins than the 
academic progress of his players.

John Thompson should do us a favor. The next time he walks off the court in 
protest of an NCAA rule, he should keep walking and never come back. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson feels as though students from lower socioeconomic areas are being 
discriminated against. I agree! Those individuals have been cheated out of a 
quality education. But how about that student-athlete who excels academically 
but loses the basketball scholarship to someone who does not even belong in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's what I call discrimination.

Now his students have learned how to react to a complicated situation, just

HOCKEY VIOLENCE COLUMN IS GIVEN POOR MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Ostler's misguided voyage through hockey violence and the mind of Marty 
McSorley leaves innocent readers ill-informed and hockey fans irate. 
</P>
<P>
First off, hockey violence is a result of poor rules and inconsistent 
officiating. As Wayne Gretzky states, the rule should be, if you fight, you 
leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
Second, violence is only promoted by the media. That's a fact, we get more 
pictures and clips of fights than good goals. 
</P>
<P>
Last, Ostler missed the point in his article. He interviewed McSorley, who 
stated that he "does not like to fight," yet Ostler turned Marty's words around 
and glamorized it.

HERE IS A SURE WAY TO END ILLEGAL PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's one sure way to halt the seemingly endless illegal payment scandals in 
college athletics: Make the payments legal. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, student-athletes are not allowed to share in any of the huge 
revenues they often help bring in for their schools. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody objects to students getting paid for working in the university bookstore 
or cafeteria. So why shouldn't their classmates be rewarded for their athletic 
skills and effort? 
</P>
<P>
Only a few are able to go on to earn a living as professional athletes. It's 
time to cut the hypocrisy and catch up to the real world.

I have been surfing longer than Richie Collins has been alive, and I can

CLEVELAND MAKES MOST OF TRIP TO GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one knew for sure exactly how long it had been since the last time Cleveland 
High's basketball team had packed up its running game, its press, its armload 
of Division I talent and all its depth, tossed it into the bus and hauled it 
over to Granada Hills for a neighborhood get-together. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Braswell, Cleveland's coach and a former Cavalier player, guessed it had 
been at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Johnson, Granada Hills' coach, reckoned it was about 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer for Highlander fans should be, "Not long enough." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind not playing them," Johnson said with a forced smile after 
Cleveland's 102-74 North Valley League win Friday night. "They're just the best 
team in the Valley by far. The rest of us are trying to find out who's second 
best." 
</P>
<P>
That's the scary part. The Valley's second-best team just might be Cleveland's 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
But first, a little on Lucious Harris, Cleveland's 6-foot, 5-inch Long Beach 
State-bound forward who scored a game-high 35 points on 14 of 21 field-goal 
attempts. He made 2 3-point shots and 5 of 6 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you guard a guy who can shoot like that?" Johnson asked no one in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
After missing his first shot, Harris was good on his next 7 and 9 of his next 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it tonight," Harris said. "We came out with a lot of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Said Braswell: "I didn't realize he scored that many points. He really had to 
take over and he did." 
</P>
<P>
Harris took on that role because guard Adonis Jordan scored just 7 points, more 
than 13 below his season average, and fellow forward Warren Harrell (12 points) 
got into early foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, however, managed to hang on to Cleveland's shirttails for much 
of the game, although the Highlanders never led after a 5-3 start. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed, 70-60, early in the fourth quarter until the Cavaliers picked up 
the pace in time to score 32 of the final 46 points and improve to 15-2, 5-0 in 
league play. The victory was Cleveland's 12th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's vaunted press -- which forced 21 of Granada Hills' 33 turnovers -- 
and depth stifled the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Etienne Graves scored 7 points in the fourth quarter when the outcome was still 
in question, Eddie Hill scored 16 and Andre Chevalier and Mike Butler each 
added 4 points -- all at crucial times. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the best we could over a period of time, then they just wore us down," 
Johnson said. "We really worked on breaking (the press), but it's hard to 
practice against. We'd get frustrated and start rushing it. We had all kinds of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Center Alvin Brown led Granada Hills with 17 points, Jamal Brantley had 14, 
Joey Rosas 13 and Aaron Lattimore and John Johnson 10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell said that the real turning point may have come at the end of the first 
quarter when, as the buzzer sounded, a prankster turned out the lights and the 
gym went black. The court was pelted by toilet paper, cups, licorice sticks . . 
. in short, anything that could be thrown a substantial distance. 
</P>
<P>
A technical foul was called and Hill made both free throws. On the ensuing 
possession Harris slammed in an alley-oop from Jordan to give the Cavaliers a 
29-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for Johnson, some good that came of the teams' reacquaintance, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we know something about them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They know not to invite them back.

Nothing much has changed for the Kennedy High girls' basketball team. The 
Golden Cougars, who have not lost a league game in 11 seasons, ran their North 
Valley League record to 5-0 this season by taking a bite out of visiting El 
Camino Real, 65-52. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy forward Dawn Coleman led all scorers with a game-high 30 points and had 
12 rebounds to spark the win. She also ignited 3 key rallies, 2 in the second 
half while scoring 29 of Kennedy's final 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman dominated the third period, scoring all 12 Kennedy points after being 
held to just 8 in the first half. Then Coleman scored the first 8 points of the 
final period to lead an 11-4 spurt that produced a 54-40 lead with 3:50 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering who was going to come out and play tonight," Kennedy Coach 
Toya Holiday said. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores rallied briefly, putting together a 10-2 run to pull to 
within 6 of Kennedy, 56-50, with 2:05 left. But the Golden Cougars iced the 
game by scoring the next 7 points. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real was paced by forward Alex Guidi's 17 points and 10 rebounds. 
Guidi, a senior, scored 10 of the Conquistadores' first 11 points but Kennedy 
still led, 16-11, after the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real Coach Neils Ludlow had mixed feelings after his Conquistadores 
(9-5, 4-1) dropped their first league game. 
</P>
<P>
"We played OK in spots (but) made a lot of mistakes," Ludlow said. "You have to 
give Kennedy a lot of credit, they played well and put a lot of pressure on us. 
It was their defense that forced us to miss a lot of the shots we used to 
make." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real threatened to make a game of it early in the second quarter, 
pulling to within a point of Kennedy with a pair of quick baskets. But the 
Golden Cougars called a timeout to regroup with 6:30 remaining in the half, 
then went on a 15-4 run during which Coleman contributed 7 points. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Falicia Stanley added 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for Kennedy (7-2, 
5-0).

</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 60, San Fernando 59 -- Jason Steele provided the defense and

RESEDA RALLIES, BEATS VAN NUYS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aggie Garcia keyed a fourth-quarter rally that wiped out a 14-point Van Nuys 
High lead and forced an overtime, allowing Reseda to escape with a 60-57 
Mid-Valley League win Friday at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The Regents, two-time defending City Section 3-A Division champions, trailed by 
2 at halftime, and the deficit grew to 14 after Stacie Toon scored 12 of her 25 
points in the third quarter. Toon also dominated the boards through 3 quarters 
and finished with 21 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Garcia and Jennifer Marzahl, who combined for 32 rebounds, neutralized Toon 
in the final period as Reseda outscored Van Nuys, 23-9, to tie the score, 
55-55, at the end of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Marzahl scored 3 of her team-high 19 points, and Cheryl Hightower added 2 of 
her 17 in overtime to secure the victory. Garcia finished with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda (10-3, 5-0 in league play) remained unbeaten in Mid-Valley action 
heading into Wednesday's game against North Hollywood (11-3, 4-0), a rematch of 
last season's 3-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys (8-4, 4-1) suffered its first league loss. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 63, Monroe 38 -- Claudia Rocha scored 21 points and had 19 
rebounds to lead North Hollywood to a Mid-Valley League win. Sophomore guard 
Jacinda Sweet added 20 points and 7 assists for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 49, San Fernando 32 -- Junior guard Julie Koppekin scored a team-high 12 
points for Taft in the West Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jane Kim added 10 points for Taft (1-8, 1-4), which recorded its first 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 48, Cleveland 42 -- Ericka Miller, Mara Phillips and Tammy Matoba 
combined for 33 points as the Chancellors (8-1, 5-0) won a West Valley League

points. 
</P>
<P>
Grant 45, Birmingham 44 -- Melissa Sullivan scored 14 points and Shenia Smith 
added 8 points and 22 rebounds as the Lancers (4-5, 2-3) eked out a Mid-Valley 
League win at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>

DAVE DISTEL: IT'S QUIET NOW, BUT '93 MIGHT BRING RELAPSE OF SUPER MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little quiet around here, huh? 
</P>
<P>
Here it is Super Saturday, and there's nothing to do but go to the beach, 
barbecue on the patio, swat tennis balls or, as I know the game, search for 
golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to Super Bowl fever hereabouts? 
</P>
<P>
It seems like forever since we had all that hype and hoopla, since hordes of 
visitors descended upon us in their private jets and motored among us in their 
rented limousines. It seems like forever since every saloon, restaurant, 
shopping center and hotel rocked in what was more an ongoing celebration than 
the buildup to a football game. It seems like forever since Washington's 
35-point second quarter turned yet another Super Bowl into a Super Bore, 
proving that even San Diego couldn't control everything. 
</P>
<P>
That was a mere year ago, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are mere pockets of enthusiasm, as expressed by one fellow who 
showed up at the office Friday in an Ickey Woods Shuffle T-shirt. Fortunately, 
he left his tiger-stripped beret and knickers at home, where he can wear them 
in solitude come Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another colleague's allegiance to San Francisco was more subtly displayed -- a 
red sweater and gold necklace. 
</P>
<P>
"Niner fans are more sophisticated," she sniffed, "than him." 
</P>
<P>
Thus chastised, Ickey's fan removed his T-shirt and shuffled off to his desk. 
</P>
<P>
This is the way this week has gone, since the Super Bowl is a game once again 
rather than our game. 
</P>
<P>
But when in the world is this game going to come back to where everyone but 
Denver's players did it best? 
</P>
<P>
After all, when a columnist wrote last year that there should be a law that the 
World Series and the Super Bowl always be played in San Diego, National 
Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle was supposed to have responded: "Not 
a bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
It probably seems a bit impatient to be wondering when San Diego will get this 
game again, except that no dates are available until after the next 
Presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
The next two games are scheduled for New Orleans ('90) and Tampa ('91) and it 
appears that the 1992 game will be another token visit to an ice capital in the 
Northern U.S. . . . a la Pontiac, Mich., in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
By my reckoning, San Diego's next shot would then be in 1993. By then, it would 
be about time Super Week got back to where it enjoyed its finest hours. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, San Diego's biggest challenge would be to surpass itself . . . from 
opening bid through execution. 
</P>
<P>
Recall that in 1984, when San Diego went after and got the 1988 game, it 
promised to expand the stadium capacity from 60,000 to 75,000 and waive rent. 
Further, it surrendered concession and parking revenues to the NFL. It even 
turned Torrey Pines Golf Course into the NFL's private country club for the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, San Diego also just happened to have perfect venues for some 
of the "other" events of Super Bowl week . . . namely parties. San Diego does 
know how to do a party. 
</P>
<P>
And the weather came up just like what we had this week, which was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, when it comes to negotiations, one side normally expects the 
other to offer just a little bit more the next time around. And so it will be 
that San Diego essentially will be bidding against itself for the 1993 game, 
which will likely be awarded early next year. 
</P>
<P>
To get the attention of the NFL owners, who can be a rather demanding bunch, I 
have put together a little list of perquisites that might be tacked on to those 
provided in 1988: 
</P>
<P>
* The NFL will once again get exclusive use of Torrey Pines, but the City 
Council and Board of Supervisors will volunteer to caddy. 
</P>
<P>
* Lindbergh Field will be open only to private jets. Plebeian travelers, such 
as fans and media, will be bused from Burbank, Orange County and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
* Each NFL owner will have the exclusive use of a hotel. In the interests of 
parity, the owners with the worst teams will get the biggest and best hotels. 
</P>
<P>
* Restaurants will prioritize seating according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
* Freeways will be closed to all but limousines and team buses. 
</P>
<P>
* Shamu, arriving in a special tank, will do the coin toss with his tail. 
</P>
<P>
* Tiger River will be reconstructed at the 50-yard-line for halftime 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
* Nervous coaches will have no concern for security, because each team will 
practice in a different corner of Camp Pendleton. Each will be assigned a 
Marine division. 
</P>
<P>
If this isn't enough to get the Super Bowl and Super Week back to San Diego, 
let them be cursed to play it forever in Miami . . . or Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, I suppose we can count our blessings that the city is not 
overrun by people doing some looney little dance step.

NEW MEXICO IS NOT WHAT SDSU NEEDS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when the San Diego State basketball team needs an easy touch to snap out 
of its first 3-game losing streak of the season, the schedule offers New 
Mexico, winner of 7 of the past 8 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos (9-5) enter today's 2 p.m. game at the San Diego Sports Arena after 
an 81-63 victory Thursday night at Hawaii and are tied with Colorado State and 
Texas El Paso for first place in the Western Athletic Conference at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
It is a much-improved team from the one that lost at home to University of San 
Diego, 64-53, on Nov. 27. That team was still adjusting to a new coach, Dave 
Bliss (formerly of Southern Methodist) and his new ways. But since losing 4 of 
their first 6, the Lobos have lost only once in the past 6 weeks -- 64-62 at 
Colorado State Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"They're coming on; they have really gained some momentum," SDSU Coach Jim 
Brandenburg said. "They're steamrolling right now." 
</P>
<P>
That is just the opposite of what has happened to the Aztecs lately. Since 
starting the WAC season with home victories over Colorado State and Air Force, 
SDSU (8-7, 2-3) has gone into a midseason slump, mostly because of shooting 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 53.4% in their first 11 games, the Aztecs have shot 40.9% in the 
past four. Their overall shooting percentage has fallen below 50% -- to 49.9% 
-- for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from what we considered a good-to-decent shooting basketball team 
and a pretty good passing basketball team to pretty mediocre," Brandenburg 
said. "We were doing a better job of distinguishing shots early on. 
</P>
<P>
"What is really important is to get the ball in everyone's hands and do it 
frequently. We have to get back to the point where we are getting good ball 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg cited the Aztecs' season-low five turnovers in a 80-61 loss at Utah 
last Saturday as symbolic of the team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"That might have been a career all-time low for turnovers, and that is because 
we didn't do anything with the ball," Brandenburg said. "Show me somebody who 
doesn't turn the ball over, and I'll show you someone who doesn't do anything 
with the basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs also have been hurt by the recent difficulties of center Mitch 
McMullen. Although he still leads the team in scoring (15.5 points per game) 
and rebounding (8.5), his production of the past four games has mirrored the 
Aztecs' troubles -- he has averaged 9.8 points and 6.8 rebounds in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said McMullen's play has been affected by a sore Achilles tendon 
and a cold that slowed him on last week's trip. But there will be no relief for 
McMullen this afternoon -- the Lobos feature two 7-footers, 7-2 sophomore Luc 
Longley and 7-0 Rob Loeffel. 
</P>
<P>
Longley has been slowed by tendinitis in his right foot and likely will see 
limited action. But while an injury to McMullen would leave the Aztecs without 
an experienced replacement, the Lobos can turn to Loeffel, a 3-year starter who 
lost his job to Longley early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico features a balanced lineup that also includes senior power forward 
Charlie Thomas (18.9 points and 8.9 rebounds), shooting guard Rob Robbins (16.2 
points) and point guard Darrell McGee (8.6 assists). 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg calls the Lobos even better than UTEP, which defeated the Aztecs, 
76-65, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Their inside game is good," Brandenburg said. "Their perimeter shooting is 
good. The balance between both seems to be right on. They have got their 
full-court fast break going. And they press well in the three-quarter court. It 
seems to me like they might be as versatile as I have ever seen them." 
</P>
<P>
As for what that means for his Aztecs and their hopes of breaking out of this 
slide, Brandenburg could only look for a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"You just persevere until you turn it around," he said.

<P>
The University of San Diego men's basketball team had a chance to win and came 
close Friday, but the Toreros instead lost for the fifth time in a row and 
third time in the West Coast Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco won, 63-58, before 1,685 fans in Memorial Gym. San Francisco 
improved to 9-7 and 1-2, while USD fell to 5-10 and 0-3. But the game was 
closer than the final score. 
</P>
<P>
With USD trailing by four, freshman forward Gylan Dottin drove the baseline, 
scored and was fouled by James Bell. Dottin hit the free throw to make it 57-56 
with 1 minute 26 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After a missed San Francisco shot, Dondi Bell rebounded for the Toreros. USD 
called timeout to set a play to Bell. It was there, but Bell missed a short 
jumper. San Francisco rebounded, and USD's Danny Means fouled Kevin Mouton. 
</P>
<P>
Mouton made both free throws to put San Francisco ahead, 59-56. USD missed a 
3-point shot, and USF's Jeff Christian was fouled and made both free throws 
with 28 seconds left. Randy Thompson scored on a tip-in with 11 seconds left to 
pull the Toreros within 61-58. But James Bell made two free throws with 6 
seconds left to finish the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"We got it to one, called a timeout and called a pretty good play," said USD 
Coach Hank Egan. "We just came up a little short. Dondi Bell is a warrior. He's 
got great pride, and he's going to be a good one." 
</P>
<P>
In the final 8:39, San Francisco made 14 of 14 free throws. The Dons finished 
shooting 87.9% from the line (19 of 21). USD, on the other hand, continued to 
have problems at the line: 11 of 24 (45.8%).

COCOA SOARS ON RUMORS OF SOVIET BUYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices soared nearly 7% Friday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; 
Cocoa Exchange in a rally led by trade houses amid rumors of a large cocoa 
purchase by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, orange juice futures fell sharply; precious metals made 
strong gains; energy futures lost ground; grains and soybeans were lower; 
livestock and meat futures were mixed, and stock index futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa settled $77 to $94 higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 
$1,461 a metric ton. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was rooted in a surge of physical cocoa buying overseas, some of 
which was attributed to the Soviet Union, although analysts had their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little skeptical as to thinking the Russians would come into the market 
in such an unsophisticated fashion as to drive the price up in a big way," said 
Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I emphasize my own skepticism," echoed analyst Arthur Stevenson of 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, "but, nevertheless, that's one of 
the things we heard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juice Futures Sag 
</P>
<P>
The rally occurred against the backdrop of a meeting in London of the 
International Cocoa Organization. The cocoa cartel is seeking a means for 
stabilizing prices, which have been in a downward trend because of a glut of 
cocoa following four years of excess production. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice plummeted on the New York 
Cotton Exchange in reaction to news that a large Brazilian orange juice 
processor had cut its price to wholesalers by nearly 19% to $1.50 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Orange juice settled 2 cents to 4.55 cents lower, with March at $1.4095 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
The silver futures market shook off its recent weakness and climbed sharply on 
New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting renewed concerns about inflation, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver for spot delivery fell below $6 an ounce early this month and the low 
price apparently has attracted some buyers, said Sharon Ziemian, an analyst 
with Citibank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"For some years now, silver has always been a good buy under $6," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures also climbed, borrowing some of their strength from silver, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $4.80 to $5.10 higher, with February at $409.30 an ounce; silver 
was 20.7 cents to 22.5 cents higher, with March at $6.245 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange on weakening chart 
signals and profit taking after a strong rally earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 to 42 cents lower, with February 
at $18.86 a barrel; heating oil was 0.60 cent to 1.15 cents lower, with 
February at 52.60 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.32 cent to 1.08 
cents lower, with February at 51.78 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade on selling 
linked to an improving supply outlook. Grain futures finished narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's Agriculture Department crop report showing larger than expected 
soybean supplies continued to weigh on the market, and reports of improved 
growing conditions in South America added to the bearish price outlook, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 1/4 cent lower to 2.25 cents higher, with March at $4.45 a 
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent lower, with March at $2.6775 a bushel; 
oats were unchanged to 3 cents lower, with March at $2.34 a bushel, and 
soybeans were 10.75 to 15 cents lower, with March at $7.505 bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle futures fell moderately while pork futures finished mixed on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle were 0.15 to 0.30 cent lower, with February at 72.70 cents a pound; 
feeder cattle were 0.15 to 0.58 cent lower, with January at 84 cents a pound; 
live hogs were 0.35 cent lower to 0.10 cent higher, with February at 43.85 
cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.85 cent lower to 0.30 cent 
higher, with February at 40.25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Stock index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
where the contract for March delivery of stocks represented by the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500 index settled 0.50 point lower at 288.75. The contract is 
worth $500 a point.

PREVIN CONDUCTS BRAHMS REQUIEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparisons can be odious -- but they are also inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
For the third of the 12 programs he leads with the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
this season, music director Andre Previn has put together a provocative and 
exigent agenda: Benjamin Britten's oft-neglected Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) and 
Johannes Brahms' familiar "Ein Deutsches Requiem." 
</P>
<P>
Britten's wondrous, purely instrumental, liturgically based canvas had not been 
heard on any Philharmonic concerts since 1971 -- when Lawrence Foster 
introduced it to subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Brahms Requiem, last performed at these concerts seven years ago, has 
long been a specialty -- as are many Brahms works -- of former music director 
Carlo Maria Giulini. On that occasion, in October, 1982, Giulini led it with an 
affecting and transcendent sense of calm (his soloists were Kathleen Battle and 
Sigmund Nimsgern). Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music 
Center, the reading achieved by Previn and the Philharmonic, in collaboration 
with the Los Angeles Master Chorale and soloists Dawn Upshaw and Thomas 
Hampson, went beyond tranquility and resignation, the emotional outer shell of 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
In Previn's aggressive but equally sensible approach, Brahms' wide musical arch 
became bridged with contrasts, supported by myriad colorful details, integrated 
in its formal and textual resonances. 
</P>
<P>
Though broad in scope, this performance never grew noisy or outspoken, never 
lacked for continuity. Previn shaped each of its movements in clear 
relationship to the others and paced the total masterfully. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic's playing proved as inspired as its leader's vision, and the 
L. A. Master Chorale, mellow and sumptuous in sound, textually sensitive, 
technically impeccable and abundant in legato, has seldom sung so tellingly. 
</P>
<P>
In the baritone solos, Hampson brought to Brahms' exposed challenges all the 
richness of tone, word connection and sensitivity to musical line that seem to 
characterize, with equal weight, his international opera and recital 
appearances. Upshaw's pure and gorgeous sound, though not invariably used for 
text-coloration, added luster to the fifth-movement solo. 
</P>
<P>
Before intermission, Previn and the orchestra gave a vehement, clarified and 
potent performance of the Sinfonia da Requiem, another touching installment in 
the conductor's ongoing survey of Britten's works.

A RELEVANT FACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Lawrence Christon's bashing of comedian Jerry Seinfeld ("Laughing on 
Empty," Jan. 17): 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Christon appreciates social relevance. And certainly nothing 
is wrong in that. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that he demands it, as if perpetually posed on the edge of his 
seat for some piquant moment when the heavens open to reveal Deeper Truth. The 
merely hilarious, then, being short of that moment, apparently causes Larry to 
take his toys and go home. 
</P>
<P>
While comedy certainly benefits from the likes of the Lenny Bruces and the Mort 
Sahls, to be so myopic as to demand such of everyone discounts the 
contributions of the Three Stooges, "I Love Lucy," David Letterman -- and Jerry 
Seinfeld.

FACES: SUPER MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LEONARD FEATHER

<TEXT>
<P>
Lois Boileau has the best of two worlds. She presides over Le Cafe, the popular 
room in Sherman Oaks, and the gourmet market next door. As a singer, she can 
hire herself to perform in the Room Upstairs, an intimate 70-seat venue over Le 
Cafe. She'll be singing there tonight, backed by Lou Forestieri's quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hollywood, Boileau was a vocal natural from age 3. "My mother noticed I 
had perfect pitch and can sing difficult songs. At 11, I began operatic 
training, but I always listened to jazz -- Ella, Billie Holiday, Sarah, Dinah, 
Peggy Lee." 
</P>
<P>
Before her high school graduation, her career was under way: Local jobs, shows 
in Las Vegas, Civic Light Opera. But she says, "Professionalism scared me. I 
really wanted to be a wife and mother." 
</P>
<P>
Married in her teens, she had three children. After the marriage ended she 
found "a marvelous man whose art work you can see in the Room Upstairs. He was 
my second husband, a clinical psychologist. I became a lay therapist and worked 
with him for 17 years, until he died some 10 years ago." She is now married to 
Jay Hodes, a physician. 
</P>
<P>
Her son Dale had the idea of launching a sidewalk cafe. The restaurant opened 
in June, 1979; the following New Year's Eve Lois Boileau introduced the talent 
policy upstairs. For a while she was the only singer; later, with the help of 
Bill Henderson, Joyce Collins, Sue Raney and others, the music expanded from 
two to five to seven nights a week, with Boileau concentrating on the business 
end and singing a couple of nights a month. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau's children all help out. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter Diana, who also does film editing, handles the beverages and bar; 
Dale, my older son, books the talent -- he's also going into personal 
management -- and Paul operates the kitchen, is the comptroller, and he's a 
computer whiz. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they all have peripheral outside interests, but believe me, when you're 
in the restaurant business, your other interests have to be peripheral."

'SUDS' RETURNS TO SAN DIEGO, POLISHED TO NEAR-PERFECTION; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO COUNTY

<P>
They whooped. They whistled. They hollered and clapped and stomped. "Suds" was 
back at the San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Stage on Thursday night, and 
the full-capacity crowd was clearly happy to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the fans waiting in the wings: the closing date of "Suds" is 
Feb. 12, but no one at the box office, where as much as $11,000 worth of sales 
have been made in one day, will be surprised if the show is extended. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the question remains: Has the show's brief off-Broadway sojourn spoiled 
the little show that sprouted in a Rep workshop, bloomed at the Old Globe and 
strutted its stuff for three months in New York, with a side trip to Canada 
thrown in for good measure? 
</P>
<P>
Nah. This slender, but surprisingly tensile story about a young girl who finds 
love and wisdom, and 50 knock-em-dead songs from the '60s, in a fluff and fold 
Laundromat is better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of working on the show, there's the feeling that "Suds," 
at last, is close to being in as final a form as it's going to get. A good 
thing, too, since the producers are entertaining visions of a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Now the story -- silkily directed by Will Roberson -- is finally as clear as 
the vocals. The show's four crackerjack performers wear the parts they created 
like second skins. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy (Christine Sevec) is a poor little Cinderella type, having the most 
pathetic of birthdays -- her pen-pal boyfriend dumped her and her cat died -- 
when she is visited by not one but two guardian angels. 
</P>
<P>
These, however, are no ordinary sisters of mercy. Dee Dee (Susan Mosher) is an 
Annette Funicello, Sandra Dee, "That Girl!" sort of caricature rolled up in 
one. She wants to teach Cindy about how to land a man and live happily ever 
after. Her songs, naturally, are of the "I Will Follow Him" and "Today I Met 
the Boy I'm Going to Marry" -- her show stopper -- variety. 
</P>
<P>
Marge (Melinda Gilb) is an altogether different kick in the Capris -- her style 
of dressing, along with tight, low-cut blouses and spiked patent leather heels. 
She's a career angel, and her theme song is "Respect," with a couple of torchy 
"Town Without Pity" and "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" numbers thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Gunderson gives the women plenty to practice their wiles on as Everyone 
Else, from a bewildered Maytag repairman, to a cute guy in the Laundromat, to 
Johnny Angel -- the angels' guardian angel who is disguised, at one point, as a 
dumpy Mrs. Halo in frowzy bathrobe and curlers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not hard to believe that this would add up to a special birthday for 
Cindy. This would add up to a special birthday for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
The show itself is like a party with the flood of music (arranged by Gunderson) 
and lights (Kent Dorsey), dancing (Javier Velasco) and clever costumes (Gregg 
Barnes) that keep the Laundromat theme going with blouses made out of "Suds" 
towels, stoles out of a string of sponges, a skirt made out of a "Suds" laundry 
bag and, at one point, a guitar from a bottle of detergent with a very long 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, too, they've got a dramatic first act break now: the arrival of Melvin 
Dudman as Cindy's dreadful Mystery Date. The curtain falls on the "Will she or 
won't she go with him?" question. The only problem is that the show forgets to 
deal with that decision when the second act starts. 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe there's one kink left. 
</P>
<P>
The "Suds" saga, the story behind the story, is part of what plays so well to 
local audiences. After all, this started when Gilb, Gunderson and co-creator 
Bryan Scott were offered a free slot at the Rep's Lyceum Space out of 
friendship and, on the spur of the moment, came up with this bit of fluff and 
fold to fit that space. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough of a story to charm New York audiences, who traveled to "Suds" 
through the chilly, dangerous streets of the steely city, looking for something 
that would justify the trouble they took to get there. 
</P>
<P>
With the right spots, this show could and should go on to have a nice shelf 
life. And who knows, if they negotiate the rights for 50 more songs, we may 
have "Suds II" on our soapy hands some day.

<P>
Three cheers for Ken Adams' blasting of the L.A. Times' love affair with New 
York City (Saturday Letters, Jan. 14). 
</P>
<P>
But Mr. Adams is too general in his complaint. The chief culprit is Dan (Brooks 
Atkinson Is My Idol) Sullivan, who makes a yearly trek to Broadway to tell us 
all about shows that we might be able to see in two years, if a Los Angeles 
company is formed, that is. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite of Broadway Dan's New York reviews concerns Mike Nichols' recent 
production of "Waiting for Godot." Here was a show that sold out long before it 
opened; that was so packed that they had to hold a lottery to determine who 
could see it. It was a production that had nothing to do with L.A., but Dan 
spent half a page telling us about it. In the meantime, our Equity Waiver 
theater is relegated to one column in Stage Beat on Fridays. Jeesh!

'DOLPHIN COVE' MAKES SPLASHY BOW ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lassie has nothing on Slim and Delbert, the dolphins who hang out at "Dolphin 
Cove" -- which also is the name of their new CBS series that premieres at 8 
tonight (Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Slim and Delbert are not only bright and graceful. They're also psychic -- they 
can sense when a swimmer is in trouble, one cove away, and lead rescuers to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
They're not really the stars of the show. That title goes to Frank Converse, as 
a recently widowed dolphin researcher, and to Trey Ames and Karron Graves as 
his children. 
</P>
<P>
In the initial episode, written by series co-creator Peter Benchley of "Jaws" 
fame, this American family arrives in Australia, where a wealthy dolphin lover 
(Nick Tate) is bankrolling Converse's studies of dolphin lingo. 
</P>
<P>
The most compelling performance in the show is from Graves, whose character 
hasn't spoken since the death of her mother. Naturally, she has a great 
affinity for Slim and Delbert, but she doesn't get along so well with her new 
therapist (Virginia Hey). 
</P>
<P>
Converse is rather cold and stolid for such a warm, soft series. But "Dolphin 
Cove" does offer Graves, the dolphins, pretty shots of Queensland and the 
currently chic status of Australia, personified here by aboriginal actor Ernie 
Dingo as Converse's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Benchley also took care not to wrap everything up in the first episode, so 
perhaps there is hope for "Dolphin Cove" in its struggle against the ratings 
currents. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Damski directed the premiere for executive producers Dick Berg, Allan 
Marcil and John Masius. Ron and Valerie Taylor ("Jaws," "The Blue Lagoon") are 
the underwater cinematographers. DON SHIRLEY

SPY SHENANIGANS IN NBC'S 'BROTHERHOOD'

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of the Smothers Brothers? Well, these are the Spy Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Saul (code name: Romulus) and Chris (code name: Remus) are incredibly great CIA 
agents on the lam from John Eliot, their brilliant boss and mentor who removed 
them from an orphanage when they were small and raised them as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Why does Eliot (Robert Mitchum) now want them dead? Will Romulus (Peter 
Strauss) lead him to Remus (David Morse)? Will Remus lead him to Romulus? Will 
Romulus get Israeli spy Col. Erika Bernstein (Connie Sellecca) to put down her 
Uzi long enough to make love instead of espionage? Will Eliot's face move? 
</P>
<P>
Finding out is not worth the cost of sitting through NBC's "Brotherhood of the 
Rose," an idiotic, plodding, barely watchable two-parter airing at 9 p.m. 
Sunday and Monday on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
The plot involves a sort of neutral zone of secret sanctuaries where double, 
triple and quadruple agents of all nations can frolic, chew gum, share diet 
sodas and hang out together in peace. Co-conspirators here are 
producer/director Marvin J. Chomsky and writer Gy Waldron, whose adaptation of 
David Morrell's book is an exercise in stupidity that no performers could 
overcome. Not that it helps that the puppy dog Morse is miscast as a killing 
machine and Mitchum is a marble-esque Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
Some mess. As one character asks: "What the hell is this?" Exactly. HOWARD

<P>
Q My fiance is divorced and is paying alimony to his ex-wife. I would like to 
know if any of my salary could be held accountable to his ex-wife after we 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
K.M., 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
A Your earnings after marriage would be considered community property and would 
be liable for any alimony payments your husband has incurred from a previous 
marriage. However, if you deposit your earnings in an account separate from 
that of any community property funds, those earnings would not be considered 
community property and would not be subject to any alimony obligations. 
</P>
<P>
You should also be aware that if any community property from your marriage is 
used to pay such alimony payments, and your husband had separate property of 
his own, your community property is entitled to be reimbursed by his separate 
property for the amount which was paid to his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q My life has been a mess for the past year or so. I have been in and out of 
hospitals and have finally gotten my health back. I just recently got a new 
job, and it looks like I'm starting to straighten out my life. I tried to buy a 
car but was told that I had bad credit because of an unpaid judgment against 
me. I don't know anything about this judgment. What can I do to fight it? 
</P>
<P>
J.G., 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A There are two ways that you could get the judgment set aside, and have a new 
trial. The first way is if you never received notice that you were being sued. 
The time limit within which you must file for the relief is 2 years after entry 
of the default judgment if no notice of entry of the judgment was given, or 6 
months after written notice of entry of the default or default judgment was 
given to you. The clerk's office in the court which issued the judgment can 
give you this information. 
</P>
<P>
The second way to obtain relief is to ask the court to set aside the judgment 
on the basis that the judgment was obtained through your mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise or excusable neglect. To qualify for this method, you must provide the 
court with a reasonable explanation as to why you did not contest the lawsuit 
against you. The time period to file for this relief is within a reasonable 
time not exceeding 6 months after the judgment was taken against you. Again, 
the clerk's office can provide you with whatever information you need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q I got a fix-it ticket for no taillights a year ago and didn't bother to take 
care of it. A friend said that I could be arrested. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
T.S., 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A Yes, you could be arrested for failing to appear in court on the ticket. When 
you signed the ticket, you promised to appear in court on the date which the 
officer wrote on the ticket. When you failed to do so, you could be charged 
with the misdemeanor offense of failure to appear in court. Normally, the court 
will issue a warrant for your arrest. You should take care of this ticket as 
soon as possible to avoid being arrested.

JOSEPH BELL: THE FANS LOSE WHEN ANGELS RAISE THE DEVIL WITH PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today I want to speak up for the baseball fans of Orange County who 
consistently pour more than 2 million yearly admissions into the California 
Angels' cash box. I contribute modestly to that total. I probably go to 25 
games a season, and I live and die -- mostly die -- with the Angels every 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Angel management is messing with Wally Joyner's head again by forcing 
him -- with tough talk or no talk at all -- to arbitrate his 1989 salary, and I 
can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner -- in case you follow lacrosse and aren't up on baseball -- is one of 
the premier first basemen of the game. He's young, and he's very, very good. He 
may even be what they call in the trade a "franchise player" -- meaning the 
team can be built around him for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a pleasant, easygoing young man, and if he worked for me, I'd do my 
darndest to keep him happy so he could concentrate on hitting home runs instead 
of brooding over his treatment by the front office. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels seem to have adopted a calculated policy of making Joyner -- and 
several other key players, including pitcher Kirk McCaskill -- unhappy, a point 
that Times sports columnist Gene Wojciechowski made trenchantly several weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing caught this so dramatically as the recent defection of catcher Bob 
Boone after the finest year of his career. Angry at the cavalier treatment he 
received from the Angel front office, he signed with Kansas City for a symbolic 
annual raise of $1. 
</P>
<P>
After the Boone fiasco, Angels owner Gene Autry said his general manager needed 
to establish a friendlier and less militant relationship with his players. 
People like me who pay to watch the Angels play thought that this finally meant 
a change in Angel management style. Some change -- if the current handling of 
Joyner is any example. Asked about this, Autry told The Times' Ross Newhan: 
"It's part of the system." 
</P>
<P>
The system he's talking about believes in treating human beings like 
automatons: You plug in $1 million, and they hit and throw and catch. Sure, 
many of them are overpaid and their agents are frequently barracudas. But the 
agents aren't on the field. The players are, and if they've been demeaned by 
their own front office, it is going to affect their play. 
</P>
<P>
I've always believed this, but I'm not an expert, so I called one to find out. 
Art Resnikoff is a former UCI psychologist who now divides a private practice 
between Orange County and Santa Monica and specializes in sports psychology 
(he's the resident shrink this year for the Loyola Marymount basketball team). 
</P>
<P>
"I've always looked at the Angels," he told me, "as a team that has much more 
ability than their performance on the field shows. The Boone episode gets to 
the heart of that. It's obvious it wasn't a business decision that drove Bob 
Boone away. The issue here was a player wanting to be recognized and 
appreciated for his accomplishments. What he said quite simply by his action 
was, 'I'm not getting the recognition I should get here in relation to what I 
was contributing to this organization.' You've got to be real psychologically 
blind not to learn from this experience." 
</P>
<P>
Resnikoff believes strongly that in any line of work "money is important but by 
no means the most important motivating factor. People want recognition for the 
work they do. Good managers in business know that, but it hasn't seemed to 
penetrate professional sports. The way a player is treated emphatically affects 
his performance on the field." 
</P>
<P>
He feels that the tribal rite of negotiating baseball contracts each winter -- 
especially with the Angels -- turns unnecessarily into a strong-arm contest. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets into winning or losing as soon as ego gets tied up in the 
negotiations," he said. "One way to win in that situation is to depersonalize 
the other party, but that's very destructive behavior because people have 
feelings. So it comes down to a question of 'How do I win?' instead of 'How do 
I solve the problem without anyone winning?' " 
</P>
<P>
I think that's what Gene Autry, in his mild way, was saying after the Angels 
lost Boone. It's time now for him to raise his voice. There are a lot of us in 
the cheap seats who want a World Series in Anaheim as badly as Gene Autry does.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: $150,000 ADVANCE BACKS WRITER'S CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newspaper feature writer Robert Ferrigno wasn't sure he was making the right 
decision when he quit his job last July in order to devote full time to 
finishing his novel. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided it was getting too hard to do both. I wasn't getting any 
sleep," said Ferrigno, 41. "By that time I was about half way through. I 
figured if it worked out, it would be great, and if it didn't I could get 
another job at another newspaper. But I just had a sense that things were going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Did they ever. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Long Beach resident signed with William Morrow &amp; Co./Avon, 
which is paying him an impressive $150,000 advance for the hard cover and 
paperback rights for his as-yet unfinished first novel, "The Horse Latitudes," 
a mainstream thriller set primarily in Newport Beach and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of foreign rights to England and Italy will earn Ferrigno another 
$100,000 in advances. He's also anticipating foreign sales to Germany, France 
and Japan and there's talk of a movie sale. 
</P>
<P>
While that's enough to inspire struggling novelists everywhere -- and send 
fellow journalists scurrying to their personal computers -- Ferrigno learned 
just how fortunate he is after a reporter friend sent him a survey of authors' 
incomes: The average annual income of published authors, according to the 
survey, is only $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of put it into perspective," Ferrigno said. "Let's just say I'm a 
grateful guy." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his decision to quit his job with the Orange County Register, 
Ferrigno said, "If I had known how little most writers make on their first 
books, I don't think I'd have had the guts to quit. My wife and I had talked 
about it for a long time. I must say, she kept pushing me to take a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno, who continues to teach journalism part time at Cal State Fullerton, 
is currently ensconced in his Belmont Shores apartment where he is completing 
the last 50 pages of his novel. He plans to turn in his completed manuscript 
within a month, and "The Horse Latitudes" is expected to be in bookstores by 
early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno explained that the novel's title refers to a part of the Atlantic 
Ocean where the trade winds die down, causing the old sailing ships to be stuck 
for weeks at a time. In order to lighten the ships, the crews would throw cargo 
overboard, and when they were really desperate, they would throw over the 
horses on board. 
</P>
<P>
The title is a metaphor for the novel's main character, Danny DiMedici, who, 
Ferrigno said, "has to get rid of a lot of emotional baggage to get on with his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
As Ferrigno explains his main character, DiMedici is in his early 30s, divorced 
and still in love with his ex-wife, Lauren Smith, a successful Newport Beach 
industrial psychologist. "His wife gets into trouble and disappears. In his 
attempt to find and help her, he gets drawn into a really nasty set of 
circumstances. The line between the good guys and bad guys gets kind of 
blurred." 
</P>
<P>
The novel, he said, is both a crime story and a love story. "The more 
(DiMedici) follows his passions, the more enmeshed he gets in murder and 
mayhem." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno had been thinking about the novel on and off for a year but did not 
begin writing it until shortly after his 2-year-old son, Jake, was born. That 
meant spending virtually every free hour he had working on the book. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno said it made a big difference once he was able to devote all of his 
time to it. "It wasn't even so much the extra time, it was just that you had 
nothing else to distract you: The idea that I had nothing to think about but 
making the rent and finishing the book." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno's wife, Jody, is a speech therapist with the Ocean View School 
District in Huntington Beach. "I was real lucky she had a good job and was 
willing to take the loss of income, but like I said, she was more gutsy about 
it than me," he said. "She always had a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno's impressive advances are also an indication of how much confidence 
both he and his literary agent, Sandra Dijkstra of Del Mar, had in the novel. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno met Dijkstra at the Squaw Valley Writers Conference run by UC Irvine's 
Oakley Hall in August and sent her a copy of his work-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," Dijkstra said, "beautifully written, a dynamite read, a book you 
couldn't put down." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing she had "something valuable," Dijkstra took Ferrigno's two-thirds 
completed manuscript to New York in late October. 
</P>
<P>
Her first stop was at a top publishing house, where an editor Ferrigno had met 
at the writers conference already had read a copy of his manuscript. The editor 
told Dijkstra she was going to give it one more reading and make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the publishing house offered a $25,000 advance -- for not one, 
but two books: "The Horse Latitudes" and Ferrigno's next novel. 
</P>
<P>
Dijkstra told them that she wasn't terribly impressed with the offer but that 
she would talk to Ferrigno. "I spoke to Robert and told him, 'I think we can do 
much better, but it's a gamble.' He said, 'Let's turn it down.' " 
</P>
<P>
The next day the publishing house came back with a $25,000 offer, this time for 
only "The Horse Latitudes." When Dijkstra turned it down, the publisher came 
back again with another offer of $50,000. But, they told Dijkstra, that would 
include world rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No way,' " recalled Dijkstra. "It was an excellent house for the book 
and the editor was a brilliant fiction editor, but we began to feel they were 
nickel-and-diming us." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno said the offer was indeed difficult to turn down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gamble," he said. "Every writer is eager to have someone like his 
work, but I think at that point it was sort of (a question of) how much faith 
do you have in yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, "both Sandy and I are poker players." 
</P>
<P>
Dijkstra and Ferrigno were prepared to put the book up for auction to see what 
the market would bear, but then William Morrow &amp; Co. came in with what 
Dijkstra refers to as a "preemptive bid." 
</P>
<P>
Dijkstra had given a copy of the manuscript to Douglas Stumpf, the senior 
editor at William Morrow who had bought Newport Beach author Michael Chabon's 
first novel, "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," for $155,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Stumpf received the manuscript, Dijkstra received a call from 
his boss, Howard Kaminsky, director of the Hearst Publishing Group, which owns 
William Morrow &amp; Co. and its associate soft cover company, Avon. Kaminsky 
asked Dijkstra not to do anything until they spoke to her. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot: Morrow and Avon offered $150,000 for two Ferrigno books. Still the 
gambler, Dijkstra turned it down. But the gamble paid off. Morrow and Avon 
finally agreed to pay that amount for "The Horse Latitudes" alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really heady," recalled Ferrigno. "It really was a sense of like you're 
walking in this gold cloud." 
</P>
<P>
Says Dijkstra: "It's a really terrific way to begin Robert's writing career, 
and there's nowhere to go but up from here. I have great confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
"In this age of megadvances with Stephen King getting $25 million for his next 
four books, it's possible this ($150,000 advance) won't sound like much. But 
first fiction is a hard sell, and generally speaking first fiction usually 
brings in under $10,000, a fact the reading public is unaware of. Robert's 
advance is a whopping big advance for an unknown author with an incomplete 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
While thrilled by his good fortune, Ferrigno said there's more to it than 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also good in terms of what it represents: My book will get out there," he 
said. "With that kind of money, it will get a lot more press and attention from 
everybody. The reason you write a book is you want people to read it. That kind 
of money means to me that people in the publishing world think this is a book 
people are going to want to read." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno obviously needn't worry about having to look for another newspaper 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are really good," he said. "I couldn't have written a better happy 
ending."

DEMOCRACY'S BIG DAY -- JOY AND PAGEANTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The peaceful transfer of power in America -- what George Bush called 
"democracy's big day" -- was celebrated Friday with moments of pageantry, 
solemnity, joy and politics as tens of thousands crammed into the monumental 
center of Washington to wait, jostle and crane for the barest glimpse of the 
inaugural excitement. 
</P>
<P>
On an extraordinary sunlit winter's day, with winds sending swirls and clusters 
of cloud across the sky, President Bush made the wait worthwhile for thousands 
of well-wishers by emerging from his new $600,000 limousine three times during 
the inaugural parade, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue with his wife, Barbara, 
at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching Mrs. Bush's hand, the new President, hatless but wearing a gray 
overcoat and scarf in the sometimes biting wind, waved happily to the crowds 
who cheered in return and then shouted, "No, no, no," whenever nervous Secret 
Service bodyguards succeeded in ushering the Bushes back into the limousine 
with the "USA-1" license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see him walking?" a woman cried out to her children at the corner of 
Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street. "You got to see him and wave to him. All 
right!" 
</P>
<P>
Bush handled the mixed mood of the day -- the blending of happiness and history 
-- with great ease and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Minutes Late 
</P>
<P>
He actually took his oath of office on the West Front of the Capitol a few 
minutes late -- just after the noon hour set by the Constitution for the end of 
the term of President Reagan. Perhaps to make up for the lost moments, Bush, a 
hand on both the Bush family Bible and on the Bible used by President George 
Washington at his inauguration 200 years ago, got ahead of himself in repeating 
the oath, breaking in before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist could finish 
reading the first few words. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush soon calmed, his serious features forming into a half-smile as the 
oath neared its end and finally breaking into a full smile, practically a 
happy, boyish grin, when it was over. Then, for the first time as President of 
the United States, he heard a military band play "Hail to the Chief" in his 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the symbol of an American presidential inauguration was 
demonstrated most clearly by 43-year-old Cynthia Levi of Chattanooga, Tenn. She 
had shown up before dawn at 4:30 a.m. to become first in line for the standing 
room at the foot of Capitol Hill. A Democrat, she explained simply: "I'm here 
because he's our new President." 
</P>
<P>
Other patient enthusiasts included Paul Gleason, a history teacher from 
Lincoln, Ill., and his wife, Cheryl. "We're used to standing," he said. "This 
is my fifth inauguration." 
</P>
<P>
Levi and the Gleasons were joined later by more than 100,000 others -- 
including a group of seniors who spelled out the message, "Good Luck Mr. 
President," with a single letter on each of their blue shirts. All crowded 
beneath the hill to see and hear a distant figure of a new President take the 
oath and then deliver his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from most inaugural addresses, Bush, who had attended a 
non-televised service at St. John's Church on Lafayette Square across from the 
White House in the morning, included a formal prayer in his own speech. Calling 
it his first act as President, he prayed to the heavenly father to "write on 
our heart these words: 'Use power to help people.' " 
</P>
<P>
With five enormous flags hanging from the Capitol -- two copies of the 13-star 
flags from the first days of the republic in 1789 and three modern 50-star 
flags -- Bush stressed the continuity of American history. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington, the President said, "would, I think, be gladdened by this 
day. For today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity 
these 200 years since our government began." 
</P>
<P>
In a message to schoolchildren watching the inauguration on television screens 
in their classrooms, Bush said: "Thank you for watching democracy's big day." 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural parade, led by Bush and a presidential honor guard, also linked 
the new Administration with history, for inaugural parades have been a hallmark 
of presidencies since Andrew Jackson on horseback led his followers down 
Pennsylvania Avenue in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 12,000 marchers, 54 bands, 79 floats and 457 horses took part in 
Friday's parade along the 2.2-mile route between the Capitol and the White 
House. For some it was old hat. Robert Auguste, a trumpeter for the Connecticut 
1st Company Governor's Foot Guard, has marched in every parade since the John 
F. Kennedy inauguration of 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to feel proud and patriotic because you're involved in it," said 
Auguste, a 54-year-old plumber. 
</P>
<P>
Some were obviously not supporters of Bush. Paul DiTeodoro, a 20-year-old 
member of the Purdue University marching band, wore a badge under his uniform 
supporting the defeated Democratic candidate for President, Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis of Massachusetts. But he was good-natured about his difference. "It's 
better not to be too bitter about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some high school students muted their excitement somewhat. Jane McDonald, who 
marched with Shawnee Mission Northwest High School of Kansas, said: "I like 
George Bush and I'm glad I came. But it's kind of cold. . . . I hope we get to 
go to the Super Bowl next year." 
</P>
<P>
"We came because we want to see Bush," said 13-year-old Lauren Rubin of 
Rockville, Md. "And so we could get out of school." 
</P>
<P>
A number of protest signs cropped up along the parade route when President and 
Mrs. Bush passed by. Some called on the new Administration to "Keep Abortion 
Legal" and "Free Nicaragua." In one case of special pleading, followers of 
Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., the political extremist recently convicted in a fraud 
case, carried signs demanding: "Pardon LaRouche." 
</P>
<P>
But the protesters, though accepted without rancor, were vastly outnumbered by 
the cheerers and clappers along the parade route, including a large number who 
chatted in Spanish to their children, pointing out the strolling Bushes to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mrs. Bush, wearing high-heeled shoes, often had to trot to keep up 
with the President along Pennsylvania Avenue, she rarely fell behind during all 
the many events of the day, chatting with friends, blowing kisses, waving, 
flicking a speck off the cheek of an Episcopal minister outside St. John's 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
And there was little doubt about the affection for her. When the Bushes showed 
up at church in the morning, some in the crowd of onlookers applauded Bush but 
shouted, "Hey, Barbara," at her. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Walbrecht of Alexandria, Va., attending only her first inauguration 
despite living in the Washington area for 20 years, said that she had done so 
partly because she liked the Bushes so much. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially Barbara," she said. "She's marvelous. She's a grandma. I'm a 
grandma. I say good for her."

JUDGE OKS PLAN FOR HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
RULING CLEARS WAY FOR $922-MILLION OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $922-million plan for new office buildings, hotels, shops and apartment 
buildings in downtown Hollywood was adopted fairly and according to law, 
despite charges that the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency acted 
fraudulently and violated state guidelines in drafting it, a Superior Court 
judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the long-awaited ruling, Judge Barnet M. Cooperman removed the last major 
hurdle blocking a major overhaul of the community's commercial sections. 
Proponents of the plan, including Hollywood-area City Councilman Michael Woo, 
hailed the decision as a milestone in the long, arduous effort to revive the 
flagging movie capital. 
</P>
<P>
"What we had was a resounding victory for those who want Hollywood to move 
forward," Woo said of the ruling. "I think a cloud has been lifted from above 
Hollywood. Now we're going to be able to move faster than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year redevelopment plan, adopted by the City Council in early 1986, 
provides a basic development blueprint for an area of 35,000 residents -- the 
most populous redevelopment zone ever established in Los Angeles. The plan 
seeks to foster development in 1,100 acres encompassing the busy Hollywood and 
Sunset boulevards. The plan, for example, envisions new buildings and modern 
storefronts around such tourist attractions as Mann's Chinese Theatre and the 
corner of Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and big-business interests have fought bitterly over the plan almost 
since it was proposed in 1983. Residents, fearful of worsening traffic 
congestion and possible condemnation of homes, battled to defeat the plan or to 
substantially reduce the amount of development it allowed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger-Scale Development 
</P>
<P>
Big-business interests -- including landowners such as Pantages Theatres, 
Golden West Broadcasters and Sunset-Gower Studios -- favored a plan permitting 
larger-scale development. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, representing most 
of those landowners, was able to control more than half the seats on the 
25-member citizens committee that helped to draft the plan under state 
redevelopment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the final plan contained significant compromises on zoning issues, it 
was seen as favoring large-landowner interests. Residents filed suit soon after 
the plan was adopted, alleging that the City Council and redevelopment agency 
pushed for redevelopment against the interests of homeowners whose concerns 
were not adequately considered. The suit charged that the CRA conspired with 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to stack the citizens committee and thus 
draft a plan favorable to big business. 
</P>
<P>
The court, noting the seriousness of the charges, took months to review the 
10,000 pages of records on which the lawsuit was based, Cooperman said. The 
judge on Friday reported finding no evidence of wrongdoing during any part of 
the plan's preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"The case has been a complicated and time-consuming one," Cooperman said. "The 
allegation of fraud is serious. The court very carefully considered the 
evidence, and the plaintiffs, in the court's judgment, produced no credible 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they would consider appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference Friday, Woo and CRA Chairman Jim Wood 
confidently predicted that the ruling would mean an end to a troublesome 
roadblock. Because of the lawsuit, they said, the county had been withholding 
property-tax revenues set aside each year for Hollywood's redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Those frozen funds now total $1.6 million, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of the lawsuit . . . frees up that money," Woo said. "We (no longer) 
have to operate on a shoestring." 
</P>
<P>
Although the CRA has begun spending some money in Hollywood, the agency now 
will be able to pour in substantially more to begin paying for improvements 
such as parking structures, low- and moderate-income housing, and social 
programs. The property taxes available for Hollywood are expected to increase 
substantially each year as real estate values escalate. It is hoped that public 
spending by the CRA will in turn draw increasing numbers of private developers 
to Hollywood, spawning both commercial construction and new housing. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the area's first two major commercial projects are expected to 
break ground near the busy corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400-Room Hotel 
</P>
<P>
The largest, the Hollywood Promenade, is expected to bring a 400-room high-rise 
hotel, an entertainment museum and a multimillion-dollar office complex to 
vacant land surrounding Mann's Chinese Theatre. That project -- unsuccessfully 
challenged in a separate lawsuit -- is expected to be completed near the end of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, on the site of a torn-down hotel, the Hollywood Galaxy 
project is planned to include six movie theaters, outdoor restaurants and a 
number of retail shops, plus an underground garage. That project may be 
completed even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Welsh, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said more is on the 
way. Architects are rumored to be designing a new entertainment center on 
Pantages Theatres property near Hollywood and Vine, he said, and plans are 
under way for a remodeling of the old Paramount Theatre building. 
</P>
<P>
Additional developers will likely move into Hollywood now that the legal 
challenge to redevelopment is apparently over, Welsh predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this opens the gates," he said. "It was an exciting day for us in 
Hollywood . . . who believe in the redevelopment of this world-famous area. I 
realize that very probably the verdict will be appealed, but I'm very pleased 
with the judge's extensive research before rendering his verdict. That 
encourages me to think that the opinion will be sustained on appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who deplored the prospect of significant new development, said they 
hope to challenge the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Norton Halper, a member of the citizens group Save Hollywood Our Town, which 
filed the suit, said large-scale commercial development would destroy the 
community flavor that exists in much of the project area. "It's not all 
run-down; it's a very nice area here," Halper said. "The community atmosphere . 
. . will be destroyed to make Hollywood a big entertainment center." 
</P>
<P>
SHOT member Brian Moore said: "This judge disagrees with the citizens of 
Hollywood. We definitely expect to appeal. We always said it would be decided 
in the appellate court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertain on Appeal 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners' attorney Christopher Sutton expressed uncertainty about an 
appeal. Legal fees so far have totaled $300,000 to $400,000, he said, and 
residents have raised less than $60,000 to offset them. His law office has 
handled most of the case as a public service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Praising Cooperman as a fair and thorough judge, Sutton said his case was 
hampered because testimony was limited to the 10,000-page administrative 
record. Additional testimony that might have persuaded the judge of fraud was 
not admitted during the months of trial because the scope of the trial was very 
narrowly drawn, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to rely on testimony from (the CRA's) own staff," Sutton said. "They 
were free, I believe, to testify to suit themselves. In my opinion, I think 
there was creative testimony and convenient memories" on the part of CRA staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
CRA attorney Kay Reiman called the assertions "sour grapes." Reiman said the 
voluminous public record and the dozens of witnesses gave Sutton more than 
enough opportunity to present his case. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his shot," she said. "That was it." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he now hopes to ease some of the bitterness that has divided the 
community.

BUSH SPEECH: TIME TO 'TALK AS NEIGHBORS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A President is neither prince nor Pope," George Bush told his fellow citizens 
Friday in his first public utterance as President. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, discarding traditional high-flown rhetoric along with his topcoat, Bush 
made clear on this bright and blustery day that his view of his new job was far 
from grandiose or imperious. Instead, with the sun on his face and the wind in 
his hair, Bush presented himself as your basic plain-spoken, good-intentioned, 
friendly neighborhood chief executive. One with a patrician sense of duty and 
bent toward good works. 
</P>
<P>
Every inaugural address has its own objectives, shaped by the man and the 
times. In Bush's case, his main goal was to begin defining himself as a 
political personality and leader. In the process, he sought to accomplish 
another significant purpose: to create a national mood of reconciliation after 
the polarizing controversies of the Reagan era. 
</P>
<P>
"We meet on democracy's front porch," said Bush, putting a homey perspective on 
the marbled splendor of the Capitol's historic west front. With tens of 
millions watching him across around the land, Bush referred to his inauguration 
as "a good place to talk as neighbors, and as friends." 
</P>
<P>
And in what was probably the most visually striking passage of his address he 
turned to Democratic congressional leaders seated at the platform and promised 
them "the offered hand" of bipartisan cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people await action," he asserted. "They didn't send us here to 
bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan." 
</P>
<P>
In presenting himself as a generous-spirited leader willing to meet his 
opponents at least halfway, Bush sought to focus a political image that has 
remained remarkably hazy for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Own Attitudes Were Blurred 
</P>
<P>
Though he has had a long public career -- including active involvement in three 
presidential campaigns -- Bush has been the instrument of other men's 
convictions in most of his previous jobs, including the vice presidency. The 
outlines of his own instincts and attitudes have remained blurred. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made an earlier effort to explain himself and his innermost beliefs to his 
countrymen, in his widely praised "I am that man" address accepting the 
Republican presidential nomination last summer. But the favorable impression he 
created was soon blurred and marred by the sound and fury of a notably negative 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday he sought to regain the pre-campaign focus by returning to what 
Temple University rhetorician Herbert Simons called "the lofty tone" of his 
convention acceptance speech. "He was trying to say, 'I'm not the guy who ran 
those nasty campaign commercials,' " Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also leaned heavily on what Bryn Mawr's Marc Ross, a specialist in the 
political uses of television, called the "moral stuff about generosity, a kind 
of old-line noblesse oblige." 
</P>
<P>
"America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral 
principle," Bush declared. Then, in an echo of the hope stated in his 
acceptance speech for "a kinder and gentler nation" he added: "We as a people 
have such a purpose today." 
</P>
<P>
"It is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly self-revealing passage that both typified Bush and helped 
bolster the harmonious mood he was trying to create, the new President offered 
the country a lofty version of family values. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions," he said. "We cannot hope 
only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to 
give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a 
citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush remembers his family," said Temple's Simons. "And he is trying to 
incarnate America in the likeness of his own family." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added a touch of steel to the gentle image he sought to convey, much as he 
had in the acceptance speech when he made his "read my lips" not to raise 
taxes. This time, mindful of the sensitivity of the defict issue among 
Democrats who control both houses of Congress, he found another target for his 
determination besides fiscal policy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and 
express our intolerance," said Bush in one of his few unsmiling moments. "And 
the most obvious now is drugs. . . . Take my word for it: This scourge will 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to show he can be a tough guy," said Kathleen Jamieson of the 
University of Texas, author of "Eloquence in an Electronic Age." "He translated 
that into the pledge to crush the drug traffic." 
</P>
<P>
And Bush reinforced his uncharismatic view of the presidential role with a 
relatively comfortable assessment of the nation's domestic condition and a 
sanguine view of international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a peaceful, prosperous time," he said, " . . . a proud, free 
nation, decent and civil." 
</P>
<P>
Abroad, Bush also found reason to be optimistic. "For a new breeze is blowing, 
and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn," he said. "For in man's heart, 
if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is 
passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree." 
</P>
<P>
By emphasizing the relative tranquility of the times, Bush made it easier and 
more natural for himself to fulfill the other major function of the speech -- 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
In broader terms, he tried once and for all to put an end to the divisive 
anguish of the Vietnam War. " . . . Friends, that war began in earnest a 
quarter of a century ago; and, surely, the statute of limitations has been 
reached . . . the final lesson of Vietnam," he added "is that no great nation 
can long afford to be sundered by a memory." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Bush's effort to establish his own personal and political identity 
required him to separate himself from his predecessor in terms of style and 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offered No Anecdotes 
</P>
<P>
And some critics missed the "Great Communicator's" skill. Bryn Mawr's Ross 
found Bush's effort to raise the nation's moral consciousness unconvincing 
because, unlike Reagan, he offered no concrete examples or anecdotes to explain 
what he meant. "There was almost no personalization, no link to real people," 
Ross complained. 
</P>
<P>
And Stephen Hess, now a Brookings Institution senior fellow and a former speech 
writer to Republican Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, 
said: "He pushed all the right buttons, but it was not a memorable speech," a 
result that Hess attributed to Bush's studiously low-keyed tone. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush may not care whether his words go down in history books. In his first 
day on the job, he seemed more concerned with trying to convince voters who 
last November entrusted him with the nation's destiny that they made the right 
choice.

TIBET'S HUNGER TO BE FREE SYMBOLIZED BY DALAI LAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LHASA, Tibet 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Dalai Lama picture? Dalai Lama picture?" was the incessant request that 
foreign tourists visiting Tibetan monasteries in recent years heard from 
maroon-robed monks and nomadic yak-herder or peasant pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
But these days Tibetans no longer need to beg foreigners for the pictures. The 
once-banned photographs of their exiled leader are being openly sold at stands 
in front of central Lhasa's Jokhang Temple, the holiest site of Tibetan 
Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese say we have religious freedom," said a Tibetan man, who declined 
to give his name, "so the Tibetan people are taking such freedom. They can 
always say, 'The Dalai Lama is our religious leader. This has nothing to do 
with politics.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, however, has a great deal to do with politics. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a month ago, his supporters staged a demonstration near the 
Jokhang Temple calling for Tibetan independence from China. Paramilitary police 
fired on the protesters, felling several. 
</P>
<P>
Western tourists who witnessed the Dec. 10 incident said at the time that a 
monk carrying the banned mountain-and-snow-lion flag of Tibetan independence 
had been killed, and that one or two other people also appeared to have died. 
</P>
<P>
The man carrying the flag was a monk from Drepung Monastery who died 
immediately from a bullet to the head, according to a young monk from another 
Lhasa area monastery. The monk spoke Thursday with this reporter, the first 
foreign journalist allowed to visit Tibet since the incident. He said that two 
other people were seriously injured in the police firing, but that as far as he 
knew they had not died. 
</P>
<P>
The martyrdom of colleagues in this and two earlier protests has fueled a 
fervent sense of Tibetan nationalism among young Buddhist monks, and the harsh 
Chinese tactics in suppressing those pro-independence demonstrations have done 
nothing to upset a trend toward increased religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, an appearance of calm has been restored in the Jokhang area. There 
are larger quantities of religious artifacts and Tibetan handicrafts for sale 
in the temple area market than has been the case for years. A year ago it was 
difficult to buy even a tiny pin bearing the Dalai Lama's picture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acts of Worship 
</P>
<P>
Now, every day several thousand pilgrims wind their way through the temple. The 
women clad in black robes with brightly colored aprons, the men in sheepskin 
coats, they pour melted yak butter into flaming lamps as acts of worship before 
Buddhist icons enshrined in side halls of the main temple. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the temple, hundreds of worshipers perform prostrations that they hope 
will bring them a better life in a future reincarnation. 
</P>
<P>
Stalls in the market area around the temple offer woodblock-print Buddhist 
scriptures; bright red, green or yellow prayer flags; fragrant leaves that are 
burned as incense; a variety of Buddhist artworks, and a wide range of Tibetan 
handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
There are two police stations in the immediate temple area, and plainclothes 
officers mingle with the crowd, but the uniformed police presence near the 
temple and throughout the Tibetan quarter of the city is very light. 
</P>
<P>
This reporter saw two truckloads of police pass through the city Thursday, 
however, and in the western half of Lhasa, where most Chinese live, uniformed 
police or soldiers are seen frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 10 incident was preceded by two bloody clashes, on March 5 of last 
year and Oct. 1, 1987. On each of those occasions, pro-independence protests 
were put down by paramilitary police firing into angry crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Each demonstration has been followed by a sweep of arrests of suspected 
activists and a period of denial of access to Tibet by Beijing-based 
correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
The March 5 protest, which came at the end of the annual Monlam festival, is 
believed to have left at least eight people dead, including protesters and a 
Chinese policeman. As many as 14 people died in the 1987 clash. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency reported Thursday that two Tibetan men 
accused of killing the Chinese policeman in March have been convicted. One was 
given a suspended death sentence, which could be carried out in two years 
unless commuted to life imprisonment for good behavior, and the other was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, the news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that 22 other participants in the March 5 uprising also 
were given prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Lhasa remained calm late into the evening Friday. It was not clear what sort of 
reaction there might be to the sentences, or even whether news of them was 
widely known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Religious Freedom 
</P>
<P>
The policy that Beijing is attempting to carry out in Tibet is quite clear: a 
limited revival of religious freedom, combined with an absolute ban on 
pro-independence activities, which are viewed as treason. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with this policy, which began about a decade ago, major monasteries 
destroyed during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution have been gradually 
restored. For instance, the official newspaper China Daily reported that the 
mummified remains of five high Tibetan lamas, desecrated by Red Guards during 
the Cultural Revolution, have been returned to their sacred resting place, the 
Great Stupa of the Pashi Lhunpo Lamasery in Xigaze, Tibet. That structure, 
wrecked by the Red Guards, has been rebuilt and is scheduled to be reopened 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of monks at each monastery is still limited to several 
hundred, the Chinese policy has been flexible enough that strong centers of 
monastic life have revived at the three great monasteries of the Lhasa area: 
Sera, Drepung, and Ganden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occasional Independence 
</P>
<P>
Despite the placing of what activist monks allege are spies within these 
monasteries, the Chinese have been unable to control ideological life in them. 
</P>
<P>
"Sera, Drepung and Ganden are all the same," a young monk said Thursday at Sera 
Monastery. "They want independence for Tibet. But the Chinese have guns, and 
the Tibetan people have no guns. All they can do is demonstrate." 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, Tibet has sometimes been part of China and sometimes 
independent. The Qing Dynasty incorporated Tibet into its empire. But Tibet 
enjoyed de facto independence from the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 until 
the Chinese Communists established control of the region in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Activist Tibetans believe that the protests of the past 16 months -- together 
with the opening of Tibet to Western tourists, who serve as witnesses -- have 
created momentum for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Many also seem to believe that the Chinese authorities have no choice but to 
allow gradually increased religious freedom, because a Cultural 
Revolution-style crackdown on religious activity would only increase 
anti-Chinese sentiment and add to Beijing's difficulties in controlling the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Anniversaries coming up in February and March may prove to be occasions for 
further protest. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Monlam Festival begins next month. Some monks say they are afraid 
to attend, while others say they may use the occasion for another 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go, we'll demonstrate," a monk at Sera Monastery said Thursday. "Even if 
they shoot, we're not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Some activists, however, predict that March 17, the 30th anniversary of the 
Tibetan uprising that led to the Dalai Lama's exile, is the most likely date 
for another major demonstration of pro-independence sentiment.

SOVIET MISSILE CUTS COULD UPSET NATO MODERNIZATION 
</P>

Although North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials publicly welcomed the 
Soviet plan to reduce short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, they said 
privately Friday that the move could upset NATO plans to modernize its own 
tactical missile force. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement Thursday by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
that Moscow would cut back its short-range nuclear weapons in East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia and Hungary was viewed here and in Brussels as a way of making 
it politically difficult for the West German government to accept NATO's 
proposals to modernize its own short-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clever Soviet Ploy 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very clever ploy by the Soviets," said a senior NATO official in 
Brussels on Friday. "They get rid of old tactical nukes that they don't need 
anyway, and this puts heavy political pressure on Bonn." 
</P>
<P>
And a senior defense analyst in Bonn declared: "It is going to be much harder 
to push a nuclear modernization program through the Bundestag (West German 
parliament). And I think that was the real purpose of the Soviet announcement." 
</P>
<P>
NATO experts estimate that the Soviet army has about 1,300 to 1,400 short-range 
nuclear launchers -- short-range is defined as less than 300 miles -- with its 
forces in Eastern Europe, while NATO has only 88 aging U.S. Lance missiles, 
with a range of 70 miles. 
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain a credible deterrent, NATO commanders, backed by 
governments in Washington, London, Paris and elsewhere, have called for the 
modernization or replacement of Lance missiles before they become obsolete in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also has expressed support for the NATO 
decision to upgrade the Lance. But leaders of the opposition Social Democratic 
Party reject the modernization proposal, in part because public opinion polls 
show that West Germans are increasingly hostile to the basing of nuclear 
weapons in their country. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of whether to modernize the short-range NATO missiles, all of which 
would be based in or near West Germany and designed to be used there, has 
become a serious political issue, which Kohl would like postponed until after 
the national elections late next year. 
</P>
<P>
Already a continuing source of friction between West Germany and its NATO 
allies, the issue could split the governing Bonn coalition between Kohl's 
Christian Democrats, Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich-Genscher's Free Democrats 
and the Christian Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
The upgrading proposal has not received full endorsement from Genscher, who has 
been a leader in seeking East-West arms reductions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Their Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze indicated Thursday that Soviet troops that President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev promised last month would be withdrawn from Eastern Europe would be 
taking their weapons systems with them. NATO officials note that the 
short-range missiles mentioned by Shevardnadze are probably assigned to the six 
army divisions that Gorbachev referred to when he made his announcement of a 
troop cut to the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 7. Gorbachev offered more 
details about those cuts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That comes to about 24 launchers but means they would still have an 
overwhelming number left," said a NATO official. "And where would they remove 
the missiles to? Could they be quickly moved back?" 
</P>
<P>
Western alliance members say that NATO has voluntarily reduced its own 
short-range nuclear stockpile, mostly artillery shells, by 2,400 warheads since 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
But public attention has been focused on Soviet arms-reduction overtures. The 
West Germans are preparing for a Gorbachev visit sometime this spring, and as a 
West German strategist put it Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"Washington and London won't like it, but I would expect another dramatic offer 
by Gorbachev to reduce his short-range missiles -- making it even more 
difficult for the West German government to vote for nuclear modernization."

STALIN'S WAR LEADERSHIP CRITICIZED IN SECRET MEMOIRS OF KEY MARSHAL

Pravda on Friday published previously secret sections of the memoirs of World 
War II Marshal Georgy Zhukov that blast Josef Stalin's war leadership and blame 
him for the annihilation of thousands of Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The memoirs in the Communist Party daily shattered the Soviet image of Stalin 
as a war hero. 
</P>
<P>
The dictator depicted himself as the savior of the Soviet Union during the war, 
which killed at least 20 million in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The image has endured despite Western studies that blame a large part of the 
Soviet losses on Stalin's purge of the Red Army officer corps in the late 1930s 
and on his refusal to believe that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler could turn on him 
and order a German invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Zhukov was deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet armed forces during the war, 
second only to Stalin himself. Zhukov is considered a hero of the defense of 
Moscow and Stalingrad. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda quoted Zhukov's daughter, Maria, as saying the marshal's memoirs often 
have been cited by Stalinists as proof that Stalin was a magnificent leader 
rather than the criminal portrayed in recent Soviet publications. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria Zhukova said key sections of her father's writings were left hidden 
in his safe for publication at some future, less dangerous, date. 
</P>
<P>
"Many thousands of outstanding party workers, members of the armed forces, 
faithful patriots of the motherland and talented leaders of the country were 
annihilated by the order of Stalin," from 1937 to 1939, Zhukov wrote. "Of 
course, one cannot forgive Stalin." 
</P>
<P>
The full page of excerpts in Pravda included Zhukov's report that Stalin played 
no role in directing the war effort.

SOVIET PHYSICISTS SUPPORT SAKHAROV'S PARLIAMENT BID

<P>
In a major rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, Soviet 
physicists Friday nominated Nobel laureate Andrei D. Sakharov to run as a 
candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming vote in favor of the 67-year-old human-rights advocate by his 
colleagues at Moscow's leading physics institute came only two days after his 
candidacy was rejected by the governing board of the Academy of Sciences. The 
attempt to prevent Sakharov from running for a revamped Soviet Parliament has 
outraged Soviet intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
During a marathon session that ended late Wednesday, the governing board of the 
Academy of Sciences selected 23 scientists as candidates to fill 25 specially 
reserved seats in the new Congress of People's Deputies. Sakharov and several 
other leading reformers, including the former director of the Soviet space 
institute, Roald Sagdeyev, failed to win nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sakharov Supported 
</P>
<P>
During secret balloting Friday at the prestigious Lebedev Institute, the 
physicists supported Sakharov's candidacy by a vote of 1,543 to 22. The outcome 
was more an expression of respect for Sakharov as a man who stuck by his 
principles during difficult times than a specific endorsement of all his 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, however, used the occasion to outline his hopes for a multiparty 
system, public control over the KGB security police, and the convergence of 
communism and capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sakharov has publicly expressed his support for President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, in recent months he seems to have become increasingly concerned 
about the slow and uneven pace of reform. In a question-and-answer session with 
physicists, he described the political situation in the Soviet Union as 
"extremely complicated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Far From Delighted' 
</P>
<P>
"I am far from being delighted about all the things that have happened in our 
country over the last year. In many ways, our domestic policies have either 
been indecisive or incorrect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sakharov, who acted as an unofficial Kremlin envoy to the troubled 
Transcaucasian region last month, said he was particularly dismayed by a 
government crackdown against leading Armenian nationalists. He called for the 
release from prison of members of the outlawed Karabakh Committee, which has 
been campaigning for the secession of the largely Armenian-inhabited region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner outlined a detailed political program which, 
if implemented, would totally transform the Soviet Union. He called for total 
freedom of movement and association. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sakharov has now been nominated as a candidate from the October 
electoral district of Moscow, it is by no means certain that his name will 
appear on the March 26 ballot. Under the complicated voting procedures, it is 
still possible to strike down his candidacy during the so-called "pre-electoral 
campaign" if more than two candidates have been nominated.

The unrest marked the most sustained display of dissatisfaction with the

PHILIPPINE ANTI-BASE RALLY FOILED BY BACKERS, TROOPS

Opponents of U.S. military bases called off a rally planned Friday at the Subic 
Bay Naval Base after troops stopped them at checkpoints and residents marched 
in counterprotest. 
</P>
<P>
Shops closed and public transport came to a halt in Olongapo, the city where 
the U.S.-run base in located. Mayor Richard Gordon spoke of "a people's strike 
in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
"They will be stretching their luck too far if they insist on coming after 5," 
he said of the protesters. "I'm sorry for them, but I'll have to send them 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of the bases turned back to Manila after approaching within 10 
miles of the city because their rally permit expired at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'God Bless America' 
</P>
<P>
At least 10,000 residents spilled onto the streets for boisterous marches as 
riot police stood nearby. One group of several hundred marched down a street 
with a band playing "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Many people in this city of 150,000 depend on the base for their living. 
</P>
<P>
The group of more than 2,000 activists who oppose any U.S. nuclear weapons on 
Philippine territory planned to hold a rally at the gates of the base in 
Olongapo. 
</P>
<P>
However, soldiers manning at least five checkpoints delayed the group, 
prompting one protester, Sen. Josephine Valentinne of Australia, to say that 
the Philippines "is a country being run by the military." 
</P>
<P>
"We've come here with a peaceful mission," she said. "We have not come to upset 
anyone or to disturb the peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Infiltrators 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers said they were looking for weapons and infiltrators from Communist 
rebel or other groups. 
</P>
<P>
The rally at Olongapo would have been the second such demonstration by the 
group in two days. On Thursday, after arriving in a motorcade from Manila, the 
group marched toward the gates of U.S.-run Clark Air Base about 30 miles from 
Olongapo. However, it was blocked about 300 yards away by riot troops and 
thousands of local residents supporting the base. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcade was organized by several groups opposed to the bases. 
</P>
<P>
The United States maintains six military installations in the Philippines. 
Washington considers them vital to Western defense interests in the Pacific and 
Indian Oceans and is seeking to extend the lease on them after it expires in 
1991.

JETLINER DROPS ENGINE AFTER TAKEOFF, RETURNS SAFELY TO CHICAGO

A Piedmont Airlines Boeing 737 jetliner "lunged" and lurched after one of its 
engines fell off shortly after takeoff Friday, but the pilot landed the plane 
safely and none of the 32 people aboard were injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 12 hours after a wing panel fell from an Eastern 
Airlines Boeing 757 near Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont Flight 1480, with 27 passengers and five crew members aboard, had 
taken off from O'Hare International Airport for a non-stop flight to Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"At approximately 1,000 feet, or just moments after takeoff, the right engine 
separated from the aircraft and landed on airport property," said Dave Shipley, 
spokesman for USAir Inc., which owns Piedmont. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death," said passenger Dante Pacioni, 56, a private pilot who 
had a view of the wing that lost the engine. 
</P>
<P>
The plane "lunged to the left" when the engine broke away, he said, but the 
pilot maintained control and guided the craft back to an emergency landing at 
O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
The wing panel that fell from Eastern's Boeing 757 on Thursday night was the 
third such incident on that type of aircraft and was the subject of a service 
bulletin, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, made mainly of fiberglass, fell from Eastern Flight 83, which had 
left Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport bound for Los Angeles with 110 
people aboard. The plane returned to Atlanta. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has issued a special service bulletin on the panel, indicating some 
problems with its installation, said Jay Golden, chief of the Atlanta office of 
the National Transportation Safety Board.

THE INAUGURATION OF GEORGE BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
IT TAKES WIFE'S HUG AND PUNCH TO MAKE BIG DAY BECOME REAL

<P>
This is what George Bush said he would do on Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"6 a.m. -- catch 3 news shows. Drink Coffee -- Play with grand kids -- Pray -- 
Go to WHouse -- Go to Cap Hill -- Get Sworn in." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that is what he did, adhering to that abbreviated agenda, written in 
his own hand a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, at 12:02:26 p.m., he recited the simple, 35-word oath of office, an 
ever-so-slight smile kept forming on his lips as he paused during the swearing 
in, and George Herbert Walker Bush became the 41st President of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time of excitement, nostalgia, solemn ceremony, more nostalgia, and 
then exhilaration. And it was a day of much more than that brief schedule Bush 
scribbled for an aide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Begins in Blair House 
</P>
<P>
Just as Bush said it would, the day began at 6 a.m. Bush, according to his 
wife, Barbara, was the first to rise in Blair House, where the Bush family -- 
George, Barbara, children and spouses, and 10 grandchildren passed the 
pre-inaugural night. The day was not scheduled to end until he visited the last 
of 12 inaugural balls and arrived at home for the first night in the White 
House at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was a playful George Bush who spied reporters and camera crews outside Blair 
House, the government guest house. He parted a curtain to tap on the windows, 
ducking back by the time the cameras had swung around to capture his image. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nostalgic new President who confessed, after bidding farewell to 
Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the U.S. Capitol after the swearing-in ceremony, 
that he could barely contain his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks. After eight years 
of friendship, it was pretty tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
sh Reagan Salutes Bush 
</P>
<P>
As they parted, citizen Reagan gave Bush a salute from the steps of the waiting 
U.S. Marine Corps helicopter, and Bush, now the commander in chief, returned it 
crisply. 
</P>
<P>
And it was a momentarily confused new President who confessed that when Sen. 
Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) addressed him as "Mr. President," he remained mute. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm standing there, waiting for President Reagan," Bush said, adding that 
"something between an affectionate hug and a kidney punch" from the woman he 
calls "the silver fox," his white-haired wife, told him he was now the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
But, all in all, it was not a terribly hectic day for the new chief executive 
and the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and silver tie -- chosen without any "big 
thought," an aide said -- Bush, accompanied by his wife, made a quick trip out 
of Blair House to attend a service at the 174-year-old St. John's Church, 
across Lafayette Park from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee in White House 
</P>
<P>
Then, joined by Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, they had 
coffee in the Blue Room of the White House with the Reagans. During the brief 
visit to the White House, Secret Service agents placed the inaugural license 
plate, USA 1, on a new, $600,000 armored limousine that was put into use for 
the first time for the trip to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans, Bushes and Quayles, emerging from the White House at 11:01 a.m., 
left en masse for the Capitol, Reagan and Bush riding together. 
</P>
<P>
What, Bush was asked, was the theme of the august day? 
</P>
<P>
"Continuity, plus," he replied, finally, after eight years as vice president, 
on his way to claim the presidency on his own. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony complete, and the Reagans on their way to Los Angeles, Bush 
stopped briefly at a luncheon of grilled cheese and chicken nuggets for his 
grandchildren, and then dined at a more elegant luncheon in the Capitol 
rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Dan, we're waiting for you," he called out good-naturedly at one 
point as the new vice president lagged behind as they moved through a corridor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs Cabinet Nominations 
</P>
<P>
Before he left the Capitol, the new President signed the papers sending the 
Senate the nominations of his Cabinet and another paper proclaiming Sunday a 
day of prayer -- the first official documents he signed as President. 
</P>
<P>
With the White House briefly vacant, a moving van pulled up to the front door, 
facing north on Pennsylvania Avenue, and the last of the Reagan's personal 
items were removed. Much of their furniture, which was replaced by 
government-issue items, had been shipped to California last October. 
</P>
<P>
Two other vans pulled up to unload the Bushes' goods, which were quickly moved 
into the mansion by a team of 93 members of the White House residential staff. 
</P>
<P>
And even before Bush was sworn in, the jumbo color pictures, 19 inches by 23 
inches, that decorated the stairwell near the Cabinet Room with scenes of the 
Reagan years were replaced by Frank Posey, a White House picture framer. Down 
came a picture of the 77-year-old President, chain saw in hand, attacking the 
brush at his Santa Barbara ranch; up went pictures of the new President; with 
dozens of Bush family members outside a church in Kennebunkport, Me.; with 
predecessors Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter; casting a line in the surf of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cabinet Room, the portrait of Calvin Coolidge of which Reagan was so 
proud was removed. So too was the portrait of William Howard Taft. In came a 
bust of Theodore Roosevelt and a painting of the signing of the Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oval Office, a collection of miniature saddles was taken out, as were 
two military landscapes. In went a collection of six Chinese porcelain plates 
and two paintings -- one of the Grand Teton mountains and one of Gookin Falls, 
in Rutland, Vt. They were selected by the White House curator, for Bush's 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
On a table behind the President's desk and on a credenza, about 20 framed Bush 
family pictures were quickly displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's choice for a desk -- constructed out of timbers of the sunken and 
raised HMS Resolute as a gift of British Queen Victoria to the United States -- 
will remain in the Oval Office. Reagan's chair, which he used as governor of 
California, was rolled out, and in came the chair Bush used in his vice 
presidential office down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Bush -- who visited the Oval Office for daily briefings with Reagan over the 
past eight years -- decided after the long inaugural parade not to visit it for 
the first time as President until today. 
</P>
<P>
In the top center drawer of his desk, said White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater, he will find a handwritten note from Reagan, wishing him well.

CONTROVERSY LEFT BEHIND AS QUAYLE TAKES ON ROLE OF BUSH UNDERSTUDY

James Danforth Quayle assumed the vice presidency Friday with pomp and 
celebration, on a sun-streaked day virtually without the contentiousness and 
controversy that marred his five-month transformation from little-known Indiana 
senator to the second-highest official in the land. 
</P>
<P>
And while clearly elated, Quayle early on assumed the role of loyal understudy 
he will have to play as President Bush's second-in-command. He smiled and waved 
reservedly, occasionally jumped out of his parade limousine to greet crowds -- 
following the same gesture from Bush -- and otherwise added little to the 
public record of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
In short, he became George Bush's George Bush -- the 44th vice president of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O'Connor Recites Oath 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the shift to high office came moments before noon, when Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor recited the vice presidential oath to Quayle, 
standing on a massive podium before the majestic west front of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the vice president stood his wife, Marilyn Tucker Quayle, smiling 
proudly as she held the family's 1890 Bible, and their children -- Tucker, 14, 
Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I, James Danforth Quayle, swear that I will support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States," Quayle declared. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor unintentionally omitted the next line of the oath -- "against all 
enemies foreign and domestic" -- leading Quayle to do the same. But after 
reciting the rest of the pledge, O'Connor added a hasty "Congratulations." 
Quayle beamed. 
</P>
<P>
In the other major public event of the day, Quayle won warm reviews from the 
crowds that stretched along the inaugural parade route from the 
bunting-bedecked Capitol to the White House, the new home of Quayle's senior 
partner, Bush. 
</P>
<P>
And Quayle, 41, returned their fervor by three times jumping out of his 
limousine. Their three children preceding them, Quayle and his wife held hands 
and walked down the street, waving shyly in comparison to the more physically 
exuberant Bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Later, using a loudspeaker built into his black limousine, Quayle saluted the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Have a great day!" he exclaimed. "See a lot of smiles!" 
</P>
<P>
Coatless, Quayle also offered a mock-serious warning to parade-goers perched on 
nearby roofs and windowsills. "Don't fall off -- you might hurt someone," he 
chided. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the crowd, Quayle supporters were plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great. Exciting! It is history," said 33-year-old Ray Frye of 
Harrisonburg, Va. "We like George Bush. And we like Dan Quayle, too. They will 
be a great team." 
</P>
<P>
Added 13-year-old Lauren Rubin, a schoolgirl from Rockville, Md.: 
</P>
<P>
"We came because we wanted to see Bush . . . and so we could get out of school. 
And Quayle is kind of cute, too." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one protester tried to resurrect the discord that has marked 
Quayle's entry into national politics. Carrying a sign that proclaimed, "Dan 
Quayle for President," the man offered a caustic explanation for his support: 
"We need a draft dodger in the White House." Quayle was besieged during the 
campaign with questions about his enlistment in the National Guard during the 
Vietnam War, when Guard enlistments were often seen as a means of avoiding 
service in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of Quayle's day, as routine as when he was Indiana's junior 
senator, stood in stark contrast to the regal traditions to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Dining on a simple breakfast of Grape Nuts, orange juice and a sip of coffee at 
his McLean, Va., home, Quayle early Friday turned to his first decision of the 
day: picking the passage to which he would open the 1890 family Bible when he 
took his oath. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, a devout Christian, chose three finalists, leaving the vice 
president to select his favorite. He picked the final verse of the 29th Psalm: 
"The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people 
with peace." 
</P>
<P>
After the inaugural parade, the Quayles were to attend the 12 inaugural balls, 
dancing along with the Bushes. Marilyn Quayle was not expecting much from her 
partner, Quayle joked recently, despite the two years he spent in dancing 
school as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Marilyn thinks I'm terrible," he said, adding bemusedly that he could find no 
reason to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Although Friday marked Quayle for new duties, not all of the routines will 
change. The Quayles will remain in their McLean, Va., home, pending renovations 
to the vice president's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. The residence, as it 
was configured before the Bushes' departure, does not have adequate space for 
the three Quayle children, aides to the new vice president have said. The 
family expects to make its formal move in early February. 
</P>
<P>
As for the job, Quayle said Thursday that he intends to make a substantive mark 
on the vice presidency, despite the predictions by some in the new 
Administration that he will disappear entirely from view for long stretches of 
time.

'BUSH BLUE' REPLACES 'REAGAN RED' IN FIRST LADY'S BALL GOWN

Just as "Reagan Red" became the trademark of Nancy Reagan, "Bush Blue" made an 
immediate impact Friday as First Lady Barbara Bush chose her favorite color for 
both her historic inaugural ball gown and the wool coat she wore while holding 
the Bible during the swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The dress was created by New York designer Arnold Scaasi and the coat by Bill 
Blass. Scaasi said that he was thrilled by the prospect of having the ball gown 
-- a sapphire velvet and satin creation -- displayed for years to come in the 
Smithsonian's popular "First Ladies' Dresses" collection. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that exciting?" Scaasi said. "I never thought I'd be going down in the 
annals of history, but I guess I am." 
</P>
<P>
The gown featured a low, square neckline and velvet bodice with closely fitted 
sleeves. The satin skirt was draped asymmetrically on the right, ending in a 
bow high on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Proclaiming herself to be the role model of "fat, wrinkled, white-haired" 
women, Mrs. Bush has been making fun of high fashion during the inaugural 
festivities, telling people to take a good look at her now because she will not 
always be this well-groomed. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a great sense of humor," Scaasi said.

A commuter plane carrying 26 passengers lost power Friday and made an emergency

A man was charged with stealing a forklift after leading police on one of the

"I guess you could say we had a high-speed chase at 7 m.p.h.," police Lt. 
Ronald Waugaman said.

Clinton J. Gandy, 48, of Greensburg, allegedly hopped on the forklift Thursday, 
turned the key, which had been left in the ignition, and drove off. An employee 
of Overly Manufacturing Co., which owns the vehicle, called police, and a 
cruiser quickly caught up with the driver. 
</P>
<P>
"When he saw the car, he just turned around, smiled, waved and kept on going," 
Waugaman said.

Gandy finally pulled over and was arrested. He was arraigned on charges of 
theft, receiving stolen property and drunken driving.

NEW ERA BRINGS WORRIES FOR SECRET SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
The opening of a new era could be read Friday in the faces of bodyguards along 
Pennsylvania Avenue as President Bush jumped three times from his limousine to 
walk along the inaugural parade route and wave to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Tense, anxious and slightly exasperated, the agents of the Secret Service are 
quickly trying to adjust to the peripatetic and unpredictable Bush after eight 
years of guarding Ronald Reagan, whose carefully scripted style grew ever more 
tightly controlled after the attempt on his life in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The agents are blunt about which style they prefer. "If we had our way, he 
would not leave the White House," Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams said 
recently. Bush, however, is equally blunt in telling both the agents who guard 
him and the reporters who cover him that he does not intend to be tied down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready to Go Out 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeatedly has told anyone who asks that he will leave the White House to 
buy bagels, eat Chinese food, grab some ice cream or go shopping "if I want 
to." 
</P>
<P>
And in the weeks between the election and his swearing-in, he has demonstrated 
that he means what he says, going out before Christmas, for example, to get a 
suit fitted at a downtown clothing store and to buy gifts at a nearby Crabtree 
&amp; Evelyn perfumerie. 
</P>
<P>
All that is familiar to the Secret Service guards who protected Bush as vice 
president and during his campaign, some of whom have begun to joke about 
watching their colleagues on the White House security detail get used to the 
new style. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has always shown a streak of independence. At his home in Kennebunkport, 
Me., he has reveled in maneuvering his powerful cigarette boat, the Fidelity, 
between the sand bars and shoals he knows by heart, leaving behind the faster 
craft piloted by less sure-handed agents. On his latest vacation there, over 
the Thanksgiving holiday, he caused a near stampede of agents and reporters 
when he decided to take an impromptu shopping stroll through the village. 
</P>
<P>
At major events such as the inauguration, the agents have many ways of 
protecting the President -- sharpshooters on rooftops, bulletproof plastic 
screens and metal detectors to check each person entering the Capitol lawn 
Friday where the viewer galleries were set up. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, however, secrecy has been, and continues to be, Bush's favored 
protective device. As his thinking goes, the threat is greatest when there is 
an open event, planned far enough in advance to allow potential assassins to 
gain access. If he simply decides at 7 p.m. one night to go eat Chinese food, 
it is impossible for anyone to anticipate, he reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Now, agents say, Bush appears to be going out of his way to be unpredictable to 
put everyone, including his protectors, on notice that the old order is no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many of the agents who protected Bush as vice president will 
now be protecting Dan Quayle, who also has tried to preserve some spontaneity 
in his public life, although, as he told reporters during the fall campaign, he 
worries periodically about the personal risks. 
</P>
<P>
"You let your mind wander from time to time, particularly when you get to an 
event and agents come up and say, 'Well, we've had this warning or we've had 
that,' " Quayle said in a conversation in an airport hangar in Owensboro, Ky. 
"I say, 'Well, do the best you can.' "

250 BUSH RELATIVES MAKE PRESENCE FELT

One of George Bush's first acts as President was to pick up his 2-year-old 
granddaughter, Marshall, and give her a hug as he entered the inaugural parade 
reviewing stand Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, shoeless in white tights, a dark blue dress with white lace collar 
and a white bow in her blond hair, promptly planted a kiss on the cheek of 
"Gampy," which is what 10 grandchildren call the new leader of the Free World. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was typical of the easy-going affection that marks the huge Bush 
family, whose presence has dominated inaugural activities this week. About 250 
children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces, 
nephews and in-laws streamed in from 22 states and three foreign countries for 
the big celebration. They filled up both a local hotel and every guest room in 
the White House Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons to Reagans 
</P>
<P>
Bush, like his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, has taken the political posture of a 
champion of family values, and he highlighted them in his inaugural address. 
But unlike the Reagans -- who were estranged from their daughter, Patti Davis, 
and seldom saw Michael, or his children -- the Bushes exuberantly surround 
themselves with their family. Michael is Reagan's son from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
And it is going to stay that way, Barbara Bush said in a CBS-TV interview on 
the eve of the inauguration of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have our children and their friends over and our friends and their 
children over," she said. "We've done that every Sunday of our married life and 
we're not going to change on that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother on Hand 
</P>
<P>
Bush's 87-year-old mother, Dorothy, the widow of Sen. Prescott Bush of 
Connecticut, was on hand for the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol, along 
with the new President's four sons, daughter and other kin. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked onto the inaugural platform, Bush leaned over and kissed his 
mother, who has been suffering from a bad back and calcium deterioration in her 
bones. She said after her son took the oath that she felt "very exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved his remarks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush spoke of the need to care for homeless people who are "lost 
and roaming," and for children "who have nothing, no love, no normalcy." He 
also said that there are "young women to be helped who are about to become 
mothers of children they can't care for and might not love." He added that 
"they need our care, our guidance and education, though we bless them for 
choosing life." 
</P>
<P>
As a clan, the Bushes tend to express their emotions freely, and shortly before 
the inauguration, Bush's son, George Jr., said in an NBC-TV interview that he 
expected it would "hit hard" when "I see my dad have his hand on the Bible and 
his right hand up, with mother holding it, looking out over the mall . . . . 
All of us will be restraining ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Son Neil added, with a laugh, that "we've had a history of teary-eyed" 
experiences.

Before moving into the White House, about two dozen members of the immediate 
family stayed at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said that the family had turned parts of Blair House into a 
playpen. 
</P>
<P>
With grandchildren running around, "I wonder that some flying missile will 
clean out some plates over there," he said, jokingly.

Amid toys strewn everywhere, Barbara Bush was observed by reporters Thursday 
playing "Simon Says" with the grandchildren.

Draws Parallel to Mrs. Truman 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush said in the CBS interview that she has two goals as First 
Lady: "I'd like to make George happy, and I'd like to do my own thing." In that 
respect, she said that she would follow the example of Bess Truman, President 
Harry S. Truman's wife.

<P>
George Jr., Neil and Jeb all have expressed interest in running for office. 
</P>
<P>
George Jr., 42, an oilman from Midland, Tex., ran unsuccessfully for Congress 
in 1978 and said that he may run for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Jeb, 35, resigned his position as secretary of commerce in Florida to work on 
his father's presidential campaign. Now he is a real estate developer in Miami. 
</P>

BUDDHIST MOURNING RITES HELD FOR CHILDREN SLAIN AT STOCKTON SCHOOL

<P>
Incense burned and Buddhist monks in saffron-colored robes chanted prayers of 
mourning Friday as the immigrant families of children slain in this week's 
schoolyard massacre were joined by scores of other members of Stockton's Asian 
community in vigils of grief. 
</P>
<P>
City officials readied the city's Civic Auditorium for a Monday memorial 
ceremony for the families and friends of a Vietnamese student and four 
Cambodian pupils gunned down in the playground at Cleveland Elementary School 
Tuesday by armed drifter Patrick Edward Purdy, who killed himself with a single 
pistol shot to the head. 
</P>
<P>
A separate funeral for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, the Vietnamese student killed in 
the shooting spree, will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
Vu-Duc Vuong, executive director of the city's Center for Southeast Asian 
Resettlement, said citizens throughout California will be asked to take part 
Monday in a five-minute period of silence starting at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Five minutes for five children who are dead," Vuong said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Improved 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the 29 students injured in the attack remained in hospitals Friday, 
but in almost all cases, their conditions were reported improved. One teacher 
was also wounded and remains hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Buddhist priests led prayers at the homes of three Cambodian families Friday in 
mourning ceremonies that last three days and three nights. More than 100 people 
gathered at the Village Oak apartments, where the families of two victims, 
8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old Sokhim An, live. Neighbors provided the five 
robed monks with incense, rice and money during their vigil. 
</P>
<P>
But a similar vigil at the home of a third victim, Rathanan Or, 9, was marred 
by a bitter reunion between the dead boy's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Ly, 40, a Cambodian refugee from Ohio who recognized his son's face among 
televised pictures of children slain in the mass shooting spree, met for the 
first time since 1979 with family members grieving for his son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watching News 
</P>
<P>
Ly said he was watching a news report about the massacre Tuesday morning in 
which five children and the gunman were killed when he spotted the picture of a 
9-year-old victim he recognized as his lost son. In a telephone call later that 
day, a Stockton official verified that "my son had been killed at school." 
</P>
<P>
"I almost passed out," Ly said. 
</P>
<P>
Now remarried with a 2-year-old son, Ly flew alone to Stockton on Thursday, 
where he was reunited with In Or, 36, Rathanan's mother and Ly's former wife. 
</P>
<P>
Ly insisted that Or knew of his existence in Ohio. Or had told reporters after 
Tuesday's shooting that her husband was reported killed in a firefight in 
Cambodia a decade ago. Or said Friday that she had no idea Ly had survived, and 
she complained that Ly had not been in touch with her or her children since he 
arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He never introduced himself as the father of my boy until he was dead," Or 
said. "If he loved the kids, why didn't he come to support his child?" 
</P>
<P>
Ly said he had been in touch with his former family by sending money. He also 
said that soon after he had emigrated to Ohio, he learned that his wife and 
children were living in Stockton and tried unsuccessfully to visit them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I learned they were alive, I flew out here, but she didn't meet me," Ly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, who had been a captain in the Cambodian army, said that he became separated 
from Or, then three months pregnant with Rathanan, when the country was 
occupied by Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
He said he made his way to Thailand and came to the United States in 1980, 
settling in Canton, Ohio, where he has worked since as a cook in a 
German-American club. When he first arrived, thinking his family had perished, 
Ly said he remarried. He said that Or has been angry with him since she learned 
that he was alive and had a new wife. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the five victims are being aided by funds provided by the San 
Joaquin County Victim/Witness Assistance Program. The state-supported agency 
will provide up to $2,800 for each funeral and up to $46,000 for hospital and 
counseling expenses for victims and relatives, said Diane Beatrice, a 
spokeswoman for the county district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice added that "thousands and thousands of dollars" have been donated to 
the Cleveland School Memorial Fund, a program set up to help the families of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. George Deukmejian, in an unusual letter to Atty. Gen John K. 
Van de Kamp, asked Friday for a complete report on Purdy's criminal record and 
detailed information about his weapons purchases. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van de Kamp said the attorney general will cooperate fully with 
the governor and provide him with whatever information he requests. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said in Sacramento that Deukmejian 
is seeking the information to help him assess various legislative proposals 
stemming from the shooting, including a proposed ban on the sale of 
military-style assault weapons, such as the AK-47 that Purdy used. 
</P>
<P>
"The deaths of five children and the injury of 30 others, all victims of a 
wanton and senseless act by a person who had a criminal record, raises a number 
of questions," Deukmejian said in his letter to the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy was buried Friday in Lodi, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sahagun reported from Stockton and Braun from Los Angeles. Staff writer Richard 
C. Paddock in Sacramento also contributed to the article.

LAWYERS START UNIT TO BACK LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Los Angeles lawyers have banded together with the local chapter of 
Planned Parenthood to advocate legal protection of abortion and other family 
planning rights. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 attorneys, many from prestigious law firms, will be lobbying and 
writing court briefs in support of family planning issues, according to Anne H. 
Egerton, a partner in the firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson. The group had its 
first meeting Friday, the 16th anniversary of the landmark Roe vs. Wade 
decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the right to reproductive choice is facing its greatest test 
in 16 years, " Egerton said, noting this month's decision by the U.S. Supreme 
Court to decide the constitutionality of a Missouri law intended to limit 
access to abortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Choice 
</P>
<P>
The Planned Parenthood-affiliated group, which will be called Lawyers for 
Choice, will meet with legislators on family planning issues, organize a public 
speakers bureau to discuss family planning issues in the community and provide 
financial assistance for pro-choice issues. A similar organization was formed 
by Planned Parenthood in the early 1970s, but it was disbanded after the Roe 
decision legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first tasks for the new group will be to file legal briefs in the 
case, American Academy of Pediatrics vs. Van de Kamp. In that case, the 
constitutionality of a new state law requiring written consent from parents or 
judges before a minor can have an abortion was challenged by a group of medical 
associations and health care providers. The California Supreme Court refused to 
order enforcement of the law, and it is before the state Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"The response at the first meeting was overwhelming," said Ruth Liberman, 
spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the largest private provider 
of reproductive health care services in Los Angeles County. She noted that 
similar professional groups will be organized soon, including Physicians for 
Choice and Clergy for Choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Expected in July 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers' group was organized first because of the U.S. Supreme Court case, 
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, which will be decided in July. The 
case is receiving extraordinary public attention because the conservative high 
court is believed ready to change directions on abortion, Liberman said. 
</P>
<P>
Liberman said the newly organized Lawyers for Choice and other women's rights 
advocates fear that a high court ruling upholding the Missouri law would invite 
other states to enact even more restrictive abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri law bans use of public funds for counseling a woman to have an 
abortion, forbids public employees from performing or assisting in abortions 
and forbids them to be performed in public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The state law, however, does not put restrictions on abortions in private 
clinics, where more than 90% of Missouri's abortions take place.

CALTRANS TO SEEK RULES FOR TRUCKS ON FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Transportation Director Robert K. Best announced Friday that he will 
meet next month with top trucking and shipping industry officials to discuss 
the possibility of restricting large trucks on freeways during peak rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the meeting came with release of a study commissioned by the 
state Department of Transportation showing that while large trucks account for 
only 2.5% to 5.5% of all traffic, they account for 20% of the delays caused by 
accidents, mechanical breakdowns, spills and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report found that large trucks cause a disproportionate share of 
traffic congestion, authors of the $300,000 study did not agree with Gov. 
George Deukmejian and other Administration officials that restricting 
commercial truck traffic on freeways during peak hours is a potentially good 
solution to the freeway congestion problem. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian first raised placing restrictions on big rigs during his State of 
the State address earlier this month. The governor so far has not made any 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The report -- ordered by the Legislature and prepared for Caltrans by Cambridge 
Systematics Inc., a private consulting firm -- assessed the causes of gridlock 
and congestion on urban freeways and was called the first of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Many Cars 
</P>
<P>
It concluded that passenger cars -- more precisely, too many passenger cars -- 
not big trucks, are the primary cause of traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with trucks, the report said, was not that their number was 
excessive but that their mishaps and breakdowns were more serious and took 
longer to clear up. "The volume of large trucks on the freeways does not have 
an inordinate impact on peak-period congestion," it said, "but truck-involved 
incidents and accidents do have a significant effect." 
</P>
<P>
If restrictions were placed on trucks during peak hours, the report said, 
"Average freeway speeds would increase slightly, but a ban would not provide 
significant relief from peak-hour congestion." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the study said that restrictions on trucks would increase 
average freeway speeds during peak periods from 40 m.p.h. to 42 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report said business would have to pay a huge economic cost if 
night and off-peak-hour deliveries were required. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that restrictions on big trucks would affect 17,000 businesses 
in Los Angeles at an estimated annual cost of $1.5 billion. In San Francisco, 
8,000 businesses would be affected at a cost of $710 million a year, according 
to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The study defined big trucks as those with at least three axles and weighing 
26,000 pounds or more. Included in the classification were those that pull 
trailers, 18-wheelers, concrete mixers, garbage haulers, beverage and fuel 
trucks. Vans, light delivery trucks, pickups and mail vehicles were not 
considered large trucks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courts' Role 
</P>
<P>
The report, noting that the federal government has broader regulatory authority 
over the trucking industry than the state, warned that courts "have 
consistently struck down state laws that have attempted to impose truck bans 
based on general concerns about congestion and safety." 
</P>
<P>
As a first step toward solving the problem of truck-caused congestion, the 
report recommended that the state expand and improve its traffic management 
programs in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. It called for the state 
to strengthen its efforts to prevent accidents and equipment breakdowns through 
its licensing, equipment maintenance and safety inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
Best said he will meet with trucking industry officials Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know to what degree shippers and receivers dependent on truck 
deliveries can realistically be expected to shift receiving and shipping times 
to non-peak travel hours," he said.

D.A. JOINS CALL FOR GRAND JURY INQUIRY OF JAIL INFORMANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office has 
joined two leading defense lawyer organizations in calling for an independent 
grand jury investigation of the use of jailhouse informants, it was learned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson confirmed the move, saying: "We 
thought it was in the public interest that they conduct an independent review. 
. . . It's a matter of public confidence in the system." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson confirmed that he and two other top prosecutors, Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Curt Livesay and Richard Hecht, director of the district attorney's branch 
operations, met recently behind closed doors with a committee of the 23-member 
Los Angeles County Grand Jury that concerns itself with criminal justice 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, which was asked last month by defense lawyers to conduct a more 
far-reaching investigation, has not announced whether it will conduct an 
inquiry. Attempts to reach spokesmen for the panel Friday night were 
unavailing. 
</P>
<P>
Calls for investigations have come in response to disclosures that began last 
October when longtime informant Leslie Vernon White demonstrated that he could 
gather enough information to fabricate the murder confession of a defendant he 
had never met. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the district attorney's position said prosecutors want 
the grand jury to conduct a review of the use of jailhouse informants by police 
agencies and the district attorney's office, but steer clear of reviewing 
individual cases in which informants testified, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suggested that reviewing individual cases would be time-consuming 
and have little impact since only courts have the power to reverse convictions 
found to have been obtained with perjured informant testimony, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has said it is encouraging defense attorneys to 
challenge in court any questionable convictions involving informant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The source said the district attorney's office, which usually provides an 
attorney to advise the grand jury, should not be involved in providing legal 
advice during a grand jury review, and noted that such advice could come from 
the state attorney general's office, the county counsel's office or from a 
"special counsel" appointed by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, in confirming the source's account, said: "Suffice it to say that we 
just decided that we should not be the body that advises them on this. . . . We 
have our own focus of inquiry (aimed at reviewing jailhouse informant cases and 
bringing questionable cases to court for review) and we're doing that. But if 
theirs is to be truly independent, it ought to be truly independent of us too." 
</P>
<P>
Gigi Gordon, a spokeswoman for the defense lawyer groups who requested in 
December that a special prosecutor be appointed to advise the grand jury in a 
more far-reaching investigation involving possible criminal misconduct, said 
Friday night: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the grand jury will act upon the D.A.'s request. I think it is the only 
right thing to do, that an outside agency investigate. But I think it should be 
more than an investigation into (the) policy (of using jailhouse informants.) 
If they're going to investigate only the policy, who is going to investigate 
any misconduct committed by members of their office? Who is going to 
investigate any misconduct commited by members of the Sheriff's Department?"

'IT'S PRETTY SENSATIONAL STUFF' AS HUDSON'S LOVE LIFE UNFOLDS IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a revealed in court this week that a man hid behind a barbecue pit and 
watched Rock Hudson and his former lover have sex next to the Jacuzzi after a 
birthday party at the late actor's home. 
</P>
<P>
But the man behind the barbecue isn't the only voyeur who has emerged in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The press and a parade of curious onlookers have staked out the courtroom in 
downtown Los Angeles each day to hear about the former leading man's secret 
love life, the subject of more than 20 years of rumors and speculation. Today, 
it is the center of a lawsuit, filed by Marc Christian, 35, Hudson's former 
lover, who is suing Hudson's estate and personal secretary for allegedly 
conspiring to conceal that Hudson was dying of AIDS for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, a former bartender, claims he suffered extreme emotional distress 
when he found out about Hudson's illness, because they continued to have 
frequent, high-risk sex for eight months after Hudson's illness was diagnosed 
as AIDS. The testimony has been so risque that lawyers have repeatedly 
apologized to the jury for the questions and responses deemed necessary to 
uncover the truth in the case. 
</P>
<P>
So far the onlookers have not been been disappointed. Besides the graphic 
details of the extended love affair and active sex life between Hudson and 
Christian, they have been regaled with a series of unexpected and sensational 
tales. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Hudson refused to take Christian to a state dinner at the White House because 
he feared that Nancy Reagan would discover he was gay. Christian testified that 
Hudson told him, "Nancy Reagan would figure out our relationship because she's 
a very bright woman." 
</P>
<P>
* Pat Boone's wife, Shirley, performed spiritual incantations over Hudson's 
body minutes after the actor died of complications from AIDS in his Beverly 
Hills home on Oct. 2, 1985, at age 59. She was speaking in tongues while 
holding Hudson's legs, saying, "Please get the AIDS out of his body," Christian 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
* Hudson's personal secretary, Mark Miller, allegedly asked Christian to 
recruit young men to have sex with the actor, "to kind of spice things up," 
Christian said. He said he politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
* After Hudson died, Christian began work on a book about their relationship, 
"Between Rock and a Hard Place," but has since abandoned the project. 
</P>
<P>
* Hudson was paid $2.5 million for a guest-starring role on six episodes of the 
television soap "Dynasty" in 1984. At the time, he had lost nearly 30 pounds 
because of his illness. Christian advised Hudson not to do the series, saying 
he looked like a "walking cadaver," but Hudson persisted. "I'm not going to 
turn down 2.5 million bucks," Christian quoted the actor as saying. 
</P>
<P>
* Hudson purposely left the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences out of 
his will because he never liked the organization. He left his estimated 
$8-million estate to a trust. 
</P>
<P>
* Hudson not only had AIDS, he also had herpes, Christian said. Although 
Christian has continued to test negative for the AIDS virus, repeated medical 
tests show that he has the antibodies for herpes. He claims he did not have 
herpes before his relationship with Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
To catch these juicy tidbits on film, photographers and television producers 
have been jockeying for camera position in the courtroom while longtime court 
observers spend hours following the trial. At one point, a television monitor 
was set up in the hallway outside the courtroom, drawing a huge crowd of 
attorneys, court clerks and idle jurors from other cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shocking, that's why we come," said Sam Brotman, one of about six retired 
men who are courtroom regulars. "It's pretty sensational stuff. We read about 
it at the beginning and decided it was more interesting than the murder trial 
we were watching." 
</P>
<P>
The trial so far may have dispelled some romantic notions Hudson's fans have 
held of him. He was treated as a hero in the fight against AIDS when it was 
revealed during a 1985 television broadcast that the actor had contracted the 
disease, even prompting a telephone call from President Reagan. But that same 
broadcast triggered Christian's lawsuit, and subsequent testimony that Hudson 
purposely lied to his lover so that they could continue to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
Christian has portrayed Hudson as a loving partner, but a person gripped by 
self-denial, who steadfastly refused to reveal his own illness or take steps to 
protect others. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that the late film star said, "they get what they deserve," when 
they watched a television program about the spread of AIDS in gay bathhouses. 
And he told the jury that when he asked Hudson what he would do if the actor 
contracted AIDS, Hudson replied, " 'I'd have one last good (sex act) and then 
I'd say 'goodby cruel world.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even after Christian confronted Hudson when the actor was being treated for his 
illness at UCLA Medical Center, Hudson refused to apologize, Christian said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Christian has been painted by defense attorneys as a 
money-grabbing opportunist who used his relationship with Hudson to further his 
ambitions for an acting career. The attorneys have pointed to a series of 
interviews Christian gave to Penthouse, the "Larry King Show," the "Phil 
Donahue Show," "Good Morning San Francisco" and others to publicize his suit 
after Hudson's death. 
</P>
<P>
Yet under cross-examination, Christian testified that he has never sought 
professional psychiatric treatment for his alleged mental distress, in part 
because he was reluctant to make public his private moments with Hudson.

SMOG AGENCY AUDIT CASTS DOUBT ON ITS PREDICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 60% of 179 firms audited by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District have under-reported the air pollution they cause, prompting the smog 
agency to question its own predictions of when air quality standards will be 
met in the nation's smoggiest urban area. 
</P>
<P>
The district's air pollution regulations and plans for future controls are 
based in large part on estimates of existing air pollution. If the latest audit 
by the district is representative of widespread reporting errors by polluting 
companies, it would make it more difficult for the four-county air basin to 
meet its goal of achieving federal clean air standards by the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
However, district officials stressed Friday that it is too early to draw any 
conclusions. They noted that the 179 firms audited represented only a fraction 
of the 24,000 companies that have permits from the district. They also said the 
audit involved only one of several pollutants that contribute to photochemical 
smog, and that not all the companies audited were randomly selected. Further, 
they said, two-thirds of the type of pollutant that was subject to the audit 
are produced by motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how representative that sample is. It's hard to draw conclusions 
from it," said Eugene F. Calafato, chief assistant to AQMD Executive Officer 
James M. Lents. "Clearly, there could be some impact, but at this point it's 
very hard to know what since the data is as sketchy as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Still, AQMD governing board Chairman Norton Younglove observed: "Our cleanup 
program is only as good as the data we receive on who is generating all this 
pollution." Younglove said most of the mistakes by companies in reporting their 
emissions were "honest errors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees Based on Pollution 
</P>
<P>
District officials, however, noted that this is the first time firms have been 
audited since a small pilot program in 1985. They said that some companies may 
have intentionally underestimated their emissions since the fees they pay the 
district are based on the amount of pollution they produce. The audit examined 
only one pollutant, reactive organic gases, sometimes called hydrocarbons. 
Companies are charged a $240 fee for every ton of hydrocarbons they report 
emitting. 
</P>
<P>
William Dennison, director of the district's engineering division, said Friday 
that the audit of the 179 companies resulted in assessing an additional 
$669,000 in fees and penalties. The fees generate about half the district's 
$23.5-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
Dennison said: "We anticipate that largely throughout the sample we looked at 
that these were honest errors. We know in some cases they were clerical 
errors." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies under-reporting emissions, however, made smaller errors, 
the district said. On the other hand, about 20% of the firms over-reported 
their emissions and were given refunds on their fees by the district. Only 
16.6% of the firms produced accurate estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enforcement Action' 
</P>
<P>
The district's six auditors also found that some of the firms were emitting 
more than allowed under their air pollution control permits. 
</P>
<P>
"In these cases we are taking appropriate enforcement action," said Edward 
Camarena, AQMD deputy executive officer for operations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the AQMD, the top 15 companies, ranked in order of the extra fees 
they had to pay, based on re-estimated 1987 emissions, are: 
</P>
<P>
Western Insulfoam, Chino, $29,221; Sundance Spas Inc., Chino, $23,346; B. P. 
John Furniture Co., Santa Ana, $19,581; Solvent Coating Corp., Gardena, 
$17,774; Ramco, City of Industry, $15,093. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald Douglas Astronautics Co., Huntington Beach, $12,588; Southern 
California Gas Co., Northridge, $11,749; Stainless Steel Products, Burbank, 
$11,146; Metropolitan Circuits Inc., Santa Ana, $10,091; Kimberly-Clark Corp., 
Fullerton, $9,945. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Furniture, Los Angeles, $9,038; Times Mirror Press, Los Angeles (sold in 
1988 to GTE Directories Press), $9,038; Blafer Woodfinishes, Los Angeles, 
$8,917; Natter Manufacturing Corp., Temple City, $8,134, and 1-Day Paint and 
Body, Anaheim, $8,134. 
</P>
<P>
To assist firms in producing more accurate reports, the AQMD said it will hold 
two free public workshops on Jan. 25 on how to prepare the emission reports. 
The workshops will last four hours and will begin at 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. at a 
building next door to AQMD headquarters, 9350 Flair Drive, El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
The audits will be ongoing. The district said it plans to examine at least 10% 
of the reports filed each year.

JURY DEADLOCKS IN LETTER-BOMB TRIAL; MISTRIAL DECLARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case of a millionaire real 
estate broker and an Israeli-American woman charged with mailing a fatal letter 
bomb to a Manhattan Beach computer company after jurors announced that they 
were hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
After five days of deliberations that some jurors said disintegrated Friday 
into a shouting match, the jury announced that it was deadlocked 6 to 6 on the 
real estate broker, William Ross, and was leaning 10 to 2 in favor of 
convicting his alleged associate, Rochelle Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said they do not know whether they will seek to retry the 
case, but defense lawyers said they will ask U.S. District Judge Dickran 
Tevrizian next week for judgments of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm disappointed that he wasn't acquitted completely. The man is 
innocent, and I think the jurors indicated there was a strong feeling as to his 
innocence," said Mitchell W. Egers, attorney for Ross, a Hawthorne real estate 
broker accused of hiring Manning and her husband to mail the bomb as a result 
of a business dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Nancy Wieben Stock had described Ross, 52, as a man of 
"quiet cowardice" who became enraged when Manhattan Beach businesswoman Brenda 
Crouthamel Adams demanded repairs on a bungalow he was selling her and refused 
to give him an exclusive listing on her own home. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Ross contacted Manning's husband, Robert Manning, an old 
associate of his from the Jewish Defense League, and hired the Mannings to mail 
a bomb to Adams' computer company in July, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
A secretary for the company, Patricia Wilkerson, 32, was killed when she opened 
the parcel, plugged it into the wall as an accompanying letter instructed, and 
the device exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution presented evidence that Rochelle Manning's fingerprints were 
found on the letter and Robert Manning's fingerprints were on the cardboard 
package in which the device was mailed. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also tracked two telephone calls from Ross's office to the office 
and home of Robert Manning on the day of his argument with Adams. Robert 
Manning is also charged in the case, but he is a fugitive, now living in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Ross's attorneys said there was no evidence that it was Ross who made the 
telephone calls and argued that the wealthy businessman, who owned nearly a 
dozen pieces of property in Los Angeles worth $1 million, had no reason to kill 
someone over the sale of a modest bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's attorneys, Michael Adelson and Alan Rubin, said her fingerprints 
could have gotten on the letter "in a hundred ways at a hundred different 
times" and undoubtedly got there before the letter was typed. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the jury, William Farrer, a Huntington Park teacher who held out 
for acquittal of both defendants, said jurors began shouting in frustration 
toward the end of their five days of deliberations, although he admitted, "I 
was by far the most abrasive person." 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't think the evidence was there for either of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With Manning, he said, "the evidence was incontrovertible that she touched the 
paper, and believable that she may even have folded the paper. But it's a very 
long step from that to conclude she had the intent to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Farrer said the purported link between Ross and the Mannings was "very weak." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the testimony seemed to center on the two phone calls (from Ross's 
office) and it wasn't proven who the parties were on either end of the phone 
calls," he said. In addition, he said, "there was no proof that the so-called 
confrontation (between Ross and Adams) was anything out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, he said, was a "strong-willed" woman who herself listed as many as 15 
people who might "harbor grudges" against her. 
</P>
<P>
Another juror, Dillena Okray, also said the government's case was not strong 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the evidence that was presented was pretty weak, and the jury was more 
or less put in a situation where they had to grasp at straws to reach any kind 
of decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Okray admitted that the fingerprint evidence against Manning was strong, but 
was not conclusive, she said. "We didn't rule out the idea that she typed it, 
but why would she type it, knowing that it was going to be sent with a bomb?" 
</P>
<P>
The judge scheduled a hearing for next Friday to set a new trial date and 
consider any motions from the defense.

 ANOTHER WALKOUT BY STUDENTS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 students at George Washington High School in South Los Angeles 
walked out of class Friday morning to protest the lack of progress in a 
contract dispute between the school district and its teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, the second such protest at a Los Angeles high school this 
week, was peaceful and ended after about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's demonstration, a number of students indicated support for Los 
Angeles Unified School District teachers' demands for pay increases. But the 
students also expressed concern that they may suffer if the teachers do not 
file their fall semester grades with the district. Some students need those 
grades, due Feb. 3, to apply for college. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' union officials have said semester grades may not be filed with the 
district if a settlement is not reached. But they have promised not to do 
anything that would thwart the students' academic progress and have discouraged 
students from walking out of classes. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have promised students that they will produce official 
grades and transcripts one way or another.

 MAN ARRESTED, RARE SWORDS RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two rare Japanese swords, part of a $1-million collection stolen in a 1981 
Hollywood Hills burglary, have been recovered and a Hawthorne man arrested on 
suspicion of receiving stolen property, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Hawthorne police said they arrested Richard Gonsalves, 55, 
Thursday night after searching his home and finding the two swords, one of 
which dates from the 15th Century and is reportedly worth $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The swords were among 150 taken eight years ago from the home of Willis M. 
Hawley, a leading collector and expert on Japanese swords, Los Angeles Police 
Detective Bill Martin said. Several of the swords stolen in the burglary have 
been recovered, but more than 100 are still missing, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest investigation began when several people called police in the last 
several weeks to report that Gonsalves had offered to sell them the swords, 
Martin said. Gonsalves was released on $5,000 bail.

A WORKOUT, NOT A HANDOUT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESSMEN OFFER IDLE HOMELESS A CHANCE TO EARN SOME MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Every day, Kenny Kahn could stand on the balcony of his office overlooking 
Santa Monica's cliff-side Palisades Park and watch scores of homeless sleeping 
on benches or asking for handouts. 
</P>
<P>
One day just after Christmas, the 47-year-old criminal attorney simply got 
tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the park, and an old dude asked me for spare change," Kahn said this 
week. "I started to give it to him, but then I said, 'How'd you like to work?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Picking Up Trash 
</P>
<P>
Kahn gave the man a plastic bag and paid him $7 to pick up trash for an hour. 
The next day the man returned with another homeless man. And soon Kahn was 
hiring a crew of 14 homeless people to regularly sweep the park and beach of 
garbage and debris. All work for two hours at $7 an hour each. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn's effort attracted the attention of several lawyers and businessmen who 
wanted to participate. On Friday, Kahn announced the formation of a nonprofit 
organization -- People Encouraging People -- to oversee the project, which he 
said has received $5,000 in pledges. 
</P>
<P>
The strange alliance of businessmen and the homeless is a marked contrast to 
often-tense relations between similar groups in many cities. Even in Santa 
Monica, where attitudes toward the homeless are lenient, officials frequently 
receive complaints about the swelling number of homeless who gather at 
Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Kahn and his associates said they want to represent part of the "new 
activism" that President Bush called for in his inaugural address by showing 
how private groups can help put the homeless back to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to complain, or you can do something about it (the homeless 
problem)," said shop owner Paul Minor, who provided the homeless workers with 
yellow T-shirts. "You can put your head in the sand and not see the problem, or 
you can own up to it." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kahn gave a small pep talk to 14 homeless workers before they fanned 
out from a picnic table to begin picking up trash. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think you don't want to work, that you just want a handout," he 
told the group. "Our job is to turn that image around. . . . This is not a 
charity. This is not a freebie. We're working!" 
</P>
<P>
Kahn readily admitted that his effort amounts to little more than a "drop in 
the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
But he has high hopes. Kahn said he will now be able to solicit and accept 
money to hire additional homeless workers. Until now, Kahn said, he has had to 
turn away many people asking for work because he did not have money to pay 
them. 
</P>
<P>
News of the project spread by word-of-mouth in the homeless community, and 
reaction was mixed. Some homeless Friday seemed indifferent, others skeptical, 
while the participants seemed cautiously enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me something to do instead of just sitting around," said Peter 
Panagiotis, 28, who said he has lived in the park for about three months. "I've 
got nothing better to do, and I'm always around, so why not?" 
</P>
<P>
But another transient scowled, "I know all the money coming in, they (the 
homeless) ain't going to see any of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Gathering Spot 
</P>
<P>
Palisades Park, which overlooks the Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Coast 
Highway, has for some time been a popular gathering point for many homeless, 
who park loaded shopping carts underneath the palms or camp out until police 
make them move on. A feeding program run by residents has been in operation in 
the park for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the food and work programs and lenient local attitudes, the transient 
community has suffered some troublesome developments recently. On Dec. 21, two 
homeless men were found murdered in Santa Monica's Crescent Bay Park, about 
three blocks from Palisades Park. A third transient was charged in the slaying.

PANEL URGES MORE HOSPITAL CARE FOR AIDS SUFFERERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Commission on AIDS, citing the need for more medical 
care for the growing numbers of AIDS sufferers, approved guidelines Friday 
urging county hospitals to make more room for patients and asking private 
hospitals to designate AIDS wards. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were two of several that the commission made that are aimed 
at providing greater inpatient and outpatient care for victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. The suggested measures require approval of the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Included are proposals to establish social service and mental health programs 
for AIDS victims, expand outpatient care at hospices and provide a "county 
ombudsperson" to coordinate AIDS-related services for patients at county 
hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have given what we consider to be a comprehensive guide to what is needed 
to (deal with AIDS) in the county," said Dr. Wilbert Jordan, who chaired the 
commission's Access to Medical Care Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"This is reality," he added. "We have a problem, and this is the best way of 
approaching it to, 1, deal with treating those patients and, 2, cut down the 
rate of infection of people who are not infected." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a physician and director of the AIDS clinic at Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center, said he hopes to enlist the support of conservative 
supervisors who have resisted some of the commission's previous efforts to curb 
AIDS, including programs aimed at intravenous drug users and homosexuals, who 
are at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we have a plan that takes into account each 
group's uniqueness and doesn't just focus on one group. This gives parity to 
all groups affected by AIDS, including blacks, Hispanics, the gay community, 
children and expectant mothers," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gates, the county's health services director, said he supports the 
recommendations in general but wants to review them more closely and report to 
the commission next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Cost Estimates 
</P>
<P>
The commission did not attach detailed cost estimates to its latest proposals, 
nor did it say where the funds would come from other than to say the county 
should sponsor legislation to increase state and federal aid to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The panel suggested that the county explore cooperative agreements with private 
hospitals to help them set up AIDS-dedicated wards and that ways be found to 
reimburse the hospitals for the added costs. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners called for an increase in the number of AIDS victims treated 
at county-run outpatient facilities to 3,000 visits a month for those with AIDS 
or AIDS-related complex or to 10,000 visits a month from people infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus who have yet to develop AIDS symptoms. 
</P>

About 1,600 AIDS or ARC patients are being seen monthly at county hospitals, 
with most of those at County-USC Medical Center, but only a small number of the 
asymptomatic HIV-positive patients are being treated at county facilities, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cordova, administrator at County-USC Medical Center, told commissioners 
that there are plans to expand outpatient care for up to 5,000 patients a month 
at his facility, more than triple the current load. But the commission, in its 
report, also stressed the need to boost the capacity of inpatient care at 
County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some community activists warned that a 20-bed AIDS ward scheduled 
to open in the fall at County-USC is too small for even the 50 to 60 AIDS 
patients already housed there. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to me to be talking about an inpatient care facility 
that's a year away that provides only one-third the need," said Phill Wilson, 
chair of the Black and Gay Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals came a day after the county Department of Health Services 
released its monthly statistics, which showed 6,135 confirmed AIDS cases in the 
county as of Dec. 31, 1988, including 48 children. Eighty-three cases are 
awaiting investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the percentage of AIDS cases involving Latinos rose 
from 16% to 17%.

RETURN ENGAGEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
ANDERSON AT SUPER BOWL AGAIN, THIS TIME IN BOOTH

<P>
Ken Anderson is at such a safe remove from this Super Bowl that his most 
physical preparation so far involves makeup. What a difference VII years make, 
huh? 
</P>
<P>
This same week in 1982, he was getting ready to wear Jack Reynolds, who had his 
own ideas about facial applications. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was the Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback then, a principal player in 
that season's National Football League championship game against the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
As you may remember, he came out of that with the NFL's more traditional 
pancake makeup, bruised and intercepted, and without the ring. The 49ers, with 
a third-year quarterback by the name of Joe Montana, won that game, 26-21. 
</P>
<P>
For the rematch, 7 years in the making, Anderson has taken to the lofty perch 
of the press box. He has gone to quarterback heaven, where he analyzes the 
action for the hometown radio and TV stations. The preparation may not be as 
desperate as it was in 1982, but it is not much more casual. 
</P>
<P>
"Call me back in 20 minutes," he says from his hotel room in Miami, "I've got 
to help edit the piece for tonight's Bengals show." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, he apologizes. "Uh, I'm just putting on my makeup for the 
5:30 show . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, the hurly-burly of that day's news cycle receding into 
relative calm, he has the time -- some -- to talk about that game 7 years ago 
and the curious setup for the rematch. As little time as he has had in his dual 
role as reporter-throwback -- "You wouldn't believe the calls I'm getting about 
that game. I simply can't return them!" -- he has been able to reflect on this 
game's dynamics, most of which he set in motion: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Walsh, the 49ers' coach. Walsh scouted Anderson at Augustana College 
in Rock Island, Ill., and helped make him the surprise first-round choice in 
the 1971 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, the Bengals' quarterback coach in those days, then helped this 
collegiate mystery develop into a Pro Bowl passer and assured Walsh's own fame 
as an offensive genius. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sam Wyche, the Bengal coach. Walsh and Wyche go way back, mentor and 
apprentice. That's curious enough. But it was Anderson who might have sped 
Wyche on his way to a coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, the draft was held in June," Anderson remembers. "And, as you 
know, Sam had been quarterback the 1970 season before I was drafted. And then 
he was traded to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
What Anderson is saying, however politely, is that he ran Wyche out of town, 
where he was just beginning to settle in as the team's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Montana, still the 49er quarterback. Although Anderson passed for 300 
yards in that Super Bowl, nearly twice what Montana did, Montana won the duel. 
At least, Montana, who threw no interceptions to Anderson's 2, got the ring and 
the car. But the intervening years have thrown Montana into a role reversal. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he's the aging quarterback," says Anderson, who was 32 then, "and Boomer 
(Esiason) is the young lion." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson observes all this from a safe, though still partial, perspective. He 
retired after the 1986 season, having finally yielded his position to Esiason 
the season before. And he gradually made his way into the broadcast booth, 
part-time at first but now as a mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
His new career is almost accidental. At no time did he set out to become the 
next Joe Theismann or Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"After I retired, the radio station (WKRC) asked if I could lead into their 
pregame show. And then I went on their postgame show. Then they asked if I 
could do a call-in show on Mondays. And then, could I come in and talk on 
Fridays." 
</P>
<P>
By February of last year, he was doing a morning radio show, a 5:30 p.m. sports 
show for WKRC-TV, and an hour-long radio call-in show in the afternoon. For 
Super Bowl week, he has been doing a Bengal special from 11:30 to midnight each 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's a steady job," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
It figures that Anderson would have a steady job. He always has. Among his 
remarkable achievements in the NFL is that he managed to stay 16 years with the 
team that drafted him. He's football's version of Johnny Bench. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say so," he says, laughing at the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, considering his pedigree, it was remarkable that he was drafted at 
all. He had gone to Augustana, a Division III school, to play basketball, not 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's next-door neighbor in Batavia, Ill., not far from Chicago, was Dan 
Issel, and no matter how celebrated Anderson later became, the sign at the edge 
of town for many years read, "Welcome to Batavia, Home of Dan Issel." 
</P>
<P>
But he tried out for football, an afterthought really, became a starter his 
senior year and began to attract scouts with his arm and mobility. The Bengals 
passed over Theismann to pick this relative unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, there is little wondering why. Anderson's talents aside, and they 
were considerable if unspectacular, his personality suited the equally 
conservative Bengals and Cincinnati perfectly. He was quiet -- some said boring 
-- efficient and loyal. Not only did he choose to live in Cincinnati, now and 
forever, but he negotiated with his bosses without benefit of agents. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder owner Paul Brown gushed, "He's Americana at its best, wholesome and 
disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
That might have been owner's code-talk, a kind of smirking about an underpaid 
worker. But it is clear that Anderson has benefited in the long run. His 
longevity, as both player and citizen, has assured him legend status in 
Cincinnati. Though he went through times when he was as much booed as cheered, 
he is now beloved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people get what I call selective memory," he explains. "You become 
better in their minds." He pauses and laughs. "I know I do in mine." 
</P>
<P>
If he didn't get the Bengals over the hump in the Super Bowl, he nevertheless 
anchored a growing franchise through the 1970s. Along the way, he acquired a 
reputation for precision and leadership. He was a study in right-headed 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Once, he completed 20 of 22 passes. Once, he completed 20 in a row. Four 
seasons, he led the league in passing. And nobody has since touched his 1982 
season, when he completed 70% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
His legacy is such that when Esiason completed a scoring pass in a recent 
playoff game, the surprised announcer reported that it was the first such pass 
in Bengal history that wasn't thrown by Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, he may be better remembered as the losing quarterback in the 1982 
Super Bowl. "I'm still disappointed about that," he says. "We made mistakes 
early and we lost." 
</P>
<P>
That game was a rare one in Super Bowl history. It was close. The Bengals had 
chances, lots of them, to win. 
</P>
<P>
If you were a Bengal fan, you mostly lamented the third-quarter drive that 
stalled on the 1-yard line with the Bengals behind, 20-7. If fullback Pete 
Johnson, the human bowling bowl, runs over the 49ers' Reynolds on just one of 
his two rolls off tackle, Super Bowl history might be different. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one everybody focuses on," Anderson says. "But what I remember are 
the interceptions. I threw one, they went for a TD. And then one of our 
receivers fumbled a pass down on the 10. They marched back and scored. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course there was that goal-line stand, but just as important, what I 
remember, we had closed the gap to 20-14 early in the fourth quarter and we had 
the 49ers backed up. It's third and long and Montana rolls out. If we held 
them, then . . . " 
</P>
<P>
His voice trails off when talking about these missed opportunities. There's no 
difference in the world like the one between a Super Bowl winner and loser. 
</P>
<P>
"Not ever having been on the winning side, I can't say what I've missed," he 
says. "But I'm very happy with my life right now. I don't have any complaints. 
Let me put it this way, it's not something that haunts me." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has always been prepared to move on after football, anyway. He began 
working on a law degree almost as soon as he became a Bengal. And although he 
has never practiced, he does have something to fall back on. 
</P>
<P>
Also, before radio and TV offered him a career choice, he was running two beer 
distributorships, one in Northern Kentucky, another in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing Anderson knew was that no one game, or even a football career, 
would amount to a life's work. It's nice to be remembered, he says, but it's 
good to keep things in perspective. He never did replace Dan Issel on that 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as that goes," he says, "I don't think there's a Dan Issel sign 
anymore." 
</P>

BARNES SETS INDOOR BEST MARK IN SHOTPUT AT 74-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, after a meet at Jonesboro, Ark., shotputter Randy Barnes found 
himself at the wrong end of a semi-automatic rifle held by an alleged drunk in 
a hotel parking lot. This week, after arriving in Los Angeles, Barnes was 
jolted out of bed by an earthquake. Some people thought it was just him 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
This guy never knew the indoor track and field season could be so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 22, caused a rumble of his own Friday night at the Sports Arena before 
a crowd of 10,004 in the Sunkist Invitational. It may not have registered on 
the Richter scale. But officials measured the fifth and last of his throws at 
74 feet, 4 inches, a world indoor best mark and the ninth best throw of all 
time, indoors or outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The previous world indoor best was held by Switzerland's Werner Guenthor at 
73-0 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' record, naturally, is an American indoor best. But it might also count 
as an American record, period. The only American ever to throw farther is Brian 
Oldfield, but his 75-0 doesn't count as a record because the performance came 
while he was a professional. 
</P>
<P>
After Barnes' throw, the shot was impounded by officials of The Athletics 
Congress, which governs the sport in the United States. It will be measured to 
determine whether it meets size specifications for record consideration. Even 
though they both weigh 16 pounds, indoor shots usually are larger in 
circumference than outdoor shots. 
</P>
<P>
That was the only world best set in this meet, but there were some other 
competitive events. Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom beat Greg Foster in 
the 55-meter high hurdles, avenging a loss last Saturday at Dallas, and Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee, in her first sprint ever, won the women's 60-yard dash. Evelyn 
Ashford didn't run because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
In an upset, Doug Padilla won the 3,000 meters in a meet-record 7:57.02. Or at 
least it would have been considered an upset if the Olympic steeplechase 
champion, Kenya's Julius Kariuki, had been in any kind of shape at all. He 
failed to finish. Or at least that was the official word. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's still running," meet promoter Al Franken said. 
</P>
<P>
Franken had a right to be chagrined, considering that he consented to 
renegotiate Kariuki's appearance fee, upward, of course, earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scott proved that he wasn't ready to relinquish his title as the United 
States' best miler, at least not on this night. He won in 4:00.80, holding off 
2 runners who are supposed to be the event's future in this country, Olympian 
Jeff Atkinson and NCAA champion Joe Falcon of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Barnes had decided to sit out the last throw, he wouldn't have had a 
bad night. He had three other throws over 70 feet. The second-place finisher, 
Jim Doehring of San Clemente, had a best of 64-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the record was very attainable," said Barnes, who had the second- best 
throw (71-10) ever by an American in the Dallas Morning News Games last 
Saturday at Dallas, despite the incident early that morning in Jonesboro. The 
rifle wasn't loaded, but the man and his companion still were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that if I didn't get the record, somebody else would. I don't want to 
spend my entire career on the heels of somebody else. I wanted a world record 
sometime in my career." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, who lives in College Station, Tex., said the record means more to him 
than an Olympic gold medal would have. Going into the last round last summer at 
Seoul, Barnes was leading. But East Germany's Ulf Timmermann won with a clutch 
throw. Barnes finished second. 
</P>
<P>
"That gave me a title, silver medalist," Barnes said. "I needed that. I was 
tired of being considered this young kid with so much potential. But this is 
even more special. Breaking a world record means that you've done something 
that nobody has done before. They give Olympic medals every 4 years." 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S 55-METER HURDLES -- Through the first four hurdles, it looked as if 
Foster might win for the second time this indoor season against Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But the fifth and last hurdle proved too much for Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom won in 6.98 seconds to Foster's 7.02. Tonie Campbell, bronze medalist 
at Seoul, was third in 7.13. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight week, Foster false-started and had to sit in the blocks 
on the second start or risk disqualification. And just like last Saturday at 
Dallas, he was able to catch Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
They were even through the fourth hurdle, which they both scraped. But then 
Foster collided with the fifth hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was relieved to win, Kingdom didn't feel as if he has gained an 
advantage over Foster, a two-time world champion who didn't qualify for the 
Olympic team last year because of a broken arm. They are scheduled to meet 
several more times this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how many races you win," Kingdom said. "You still have doubts. I 
didn't erase them tonight. I still didn't run a clean race." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said he has to work on his start. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S 60-YARD DASH -- Joyner-Kersee was invited to Friday's inauguration, but 
she didn't attend. Nothing personal against George Bush. She just said that she 
is tired of traveling. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be a wise decision. Ashford, who was supposed to run against 
Joyner-Kersee, went to the Inauguration Gala Thursday night in Washington and 
came home with the flu. She attended the meet but wasn't able to run. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Joyner-Kersee, competing in a sprint for the first time since she used 
to challenge her brother, Al, outside their house in East St. Louis, Ill., had 
to beat a good field. Also entered were Olympians Gail Devers-Roberts, formerly 
of UCLA, and Juliet Cuthbert of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she didn't get a sprinter's start, standing almost straight up out 
of the blocks, Joyner-Kersee won in 6.68, just off Ashford's meet record of 
6.66. Devers-Roberts was second in 6.76 and Cuthbert third in 6.81. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a big old Clydesdale out there," said Joyner-Kersee, who is 
sprinting so that she can improve her speed for the long jump. "I'm too big to 
be in the sprints." 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S 60-YARD DASH -- Emmit King won in 6.15 to Brian Bridgewater's 6.27. But 
the most interesting aspect of the race was former high school sensation 
Houston McTear's comeback after 4 years away from the sport. He finished fourth 
in 6.49. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't feel too badly except that he would have liked to have gotten 
a better start. He had to stay in the blocks after false-starting once. 
</P>
<P>
"They took my start away from me," he said. "That's one thing I can still do. I 
can still react to the gun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

RIOTS, REFUGEES WON'T KEEP ORIOLES FROM MIAMI

<P>
Despite the rioting and unrest that disrupted Super Bowl Week, the Baltimore 
Orioles say they are not concerned about their spring-training program in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The developments of the past week, coupled with the influx of Nicaraguan 
refugees that has transformed Bobby Maduro Stadium, where the Orioles train, 
into a refugee center, fueled speculation that the Orioles would hasten their 
departure from the site they have used for spring-training camp for over 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"You call it a development; can I call it an occurence?" asked Larry Lucchino, 
president of the Orioles. "It is an unfortunate and sad occurence, but no, I 
don't think it will have any long-term impact on our spring-training plans." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Lucchino dismiss the notion that the Orioles would be affected 
this year, but treasurer Bob Flanagan did not rule out the possibility of the 
club eventually returning to Miami on a full-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to find a suitable site to house both the major- and minor-league 
personnel, the Orioles this year have shifted the first two weeks of spring 
training to Sarasota County. They will shift to Miami March 1 and play all but 
two of their home exhibition games at Bobby Maduro Stadium, which is within two 
miles of the Overtown district that has been the scene of most of the 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles have long expressed a desire to have one spring-training facility, 
and Sarasota County is trying to build a 7,500-seat stadium to lure the team 
there permanently. 
</P>
<P>
The migration of thousands of Nicaraguans to Miami, where they have been housed 
at the stadium, has added to the uncertainty of the situation. Flanagan, 
however, expressed confidence that the Orioles' camp would not be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Caeser Odio, who is Miami's city manager, has been very up front about the 
problem he has (with the influx of Nicaraguans)," said Flanagan. "It is a 
situation with which we have great empathy. But he (Odio) also understands we 
have a schedule, that people expect to see games at the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan has high praise for Odio. "A lot of cities would do well to have a 
city manager like him," said Flanagan. "He has been a spearhead behind Miami's 
drive to keep the Orioles there and he's a very aggressive guy. 
</P>
<P>
"His problem (in competing with smaller Florida towns) is that he doesn't have 
the land they have in places like Port St. Lucie. But he's a fighter and he 
hasn't given up on the idea of finding a way to keep us in Miami beyond this 
year. He was in Washington recently and he came in to see me because he had 
another idea and he wanted to bat a few things around." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if that meant the club had not ruled out the possibility of returning its 
minor-league operation to an all-purpose facility in Miami, Flanagan replied, 
"Heck no, we haven't given up on that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
It had been a foregone conclusion that as soon as the Orioles found an 
acceptable location, with a park big enough to handle exhibition crowds, they 
would quickly desert Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles will hold their early workouts this spring at the old Kansas City 
Royals' Baseball Academy, where the minor-leaguers will also train, and there 
is talk of a stadium being built in that area. 
</P>
<P>
But no long-range commitments have been made by either side, and Flanagan 
insists that Odio is making certain Miami isn't out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, the Nicaraguan refugees currently living in Bobby Maduro Stadium 
will be relocated beginning next week. When it is time for the Orioles to take 
over, "it will be yours" Odio told Flanagan.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS; 
</P>
<P>
YUGOSLAV TEEN IS EMERGING AS NEXT PRODIGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The future of men's tennis appears to be 17 years old, 6 feet 4 inches tall, 
left-handed and Yugoslavian. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Goran Ivanisevic, who up until 2 weeks ago had won only one Grand 
Prix match in his life. But quicker than you can spell his name, he is in the 
round of 16 here at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Ion Tiriac visited Leiman, West Germany, and began twitching his 
forest of a mustache in the direction of a red-haired teen named Boris Becker, 
tennis has been waiting for another prodigy to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic may be the one. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely has the chance," said Tiriac, who does not manage the 
Yugoslavian teen-ager but does advise him. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the technical ability and the physical ability," Tiriac said. "He has 
so much ability and fluidity. In 2 years, he should be in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
On a cloudy Saturday morning, Ivanisevic was impressive while defeating Tom 
Nijssen of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4, 6-0, in a third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ivanisevic's sixth consecutive victory because he had to survive three 
qualifying matches to enter the main draw. Going into the match with Nijssen, 
Ivanisevic was confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure I was going to beat him," Ivanisevic said. "I am very happy I came 
in without pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic was ranked No. 371 before the tournament in Adelaide, Australia. He 
got into that tournament as a lucky loser and reached the quarterfinals, where 
he lost to Mark Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the lanky player with the big serve also showed he has a big 
temper. Ivanisevic received 5 umpire warnings in 3 matches, threw his racket 
several times and once disgustedly hit a ball that struck a ball girl. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to work on his mental ability now," Tiriac said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Ivanisevic in the round of 16 were Michiel Schapers of the Netherlands, 
Jonas B. Svensson of Sweden, Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia and South African 
Christo van Rensburg, who defeated Woodforde, 2-6, 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Schapers defeated 12th-seeded Swede Mikael Pernfors, 6-7, 7-5, 7-6, 6-0; 
Svensson downed Australian Wally Masur, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, and Mecir beat 
Jason Stoltenberg, another Australian, 6-2, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw, Hana Mandlikova won her third consecutive 3-set match, 
3-6, 6-3, 9-7, over Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands; Helena Sukova defeated 
Lisa O'Neill of Australia, 6-2, 6-1, and Catherine Tanvier of France upset 
10th-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-2, 6-3. Australian Belinda Cordell shortened 
the comeback of Andrea Temesvari of Hungary, 1-6, 7-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova was clearly favored against Czech Jana Novotna, whom she 
dispatched, 6-2, 6-2, but if Navratilova is lucky enough to run up against 
Steffi Graf in the Australian Open final, she knows it clearly would be an 
uphill race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the underdog," Navratilova said. "I am. Steffi has won everything in sight 
and I have not." 
</P>
<P>
In late matches Friday night, 13th-seeded Pat Cash hung on to defeat Richey 
Reneberg, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, and in a battle of Americans, 10th-seeded 
Aaron Krickstein swept past Jeff Tarango, 6-3, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was later announced that Cash was fined $500 for an audible obscenity. John 
McEnroe was fined for verbal abuse of a linesman after his 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 
victory over Australian Brod Dyke. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although John McEnroe is a staunch ATP supporter, he is not entirely happy with 
the new 1990 tour setup. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, it's good, but I mean it's almost the same tour and I don't think 
the top players had enough involvement in the whole situation." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current Grand Prix rules, players are required to compete in 14 
tournaments, which include the 4 Grand Slam events. But in the ATP tour there 
are 11 tournament commitments in addition to the 4 Grand Slams, for a total of 
15. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played any more than about 12 tournaments in about 4 years, so to 
think that I'm going to play 15 is crazy," he said. "I can tell you right now, 
I'm not going to." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe also sounded an ominous warning to the lesser open series tournaments, 
such as the $250,000 Volvo/Los Angeles event. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the tournaments that are going to get hurt are those open series that 
have minimum prize money," he said. "I don't think that the players are going 
to play those tournaments and I think that there's going to be a big problem. . 
. . "

REVOLUTIONARY BOAT FROM SAN PEDRO CHALLENGES FOR LITTLE AMERICA'S CUP

A revolutionary sailboat from the Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club in San Pedro will 
start a best-of-7 series against the Australian defender of the Little 
America's Cup here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The competition -- known formally as the International Catamaran Challenge 
Trophy -- is for Class C catamarans 25 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Class C catamarans are distinct for their airfoil wing-type sails, which 
inspired the design of the 60-foot Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran Dennis Conner 
sailed in a lopsided, 2-race defense of the America's Cup against New Zealand's 
130-foot monohull last September. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro boat, dubbed Wingmill, features an airfoil that rotates top to 
bottom like a pinwheel when the boat tacks or jibes (alters course across the 
wind direction). It will be sailed by brothers Steve and Brian Dair of San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The defender will be Edge II, a conventional Class C cat to be sailed by Simon 
McKeon and Dave Churcher.

At Wengen, Switzerland, Marc Girardelli, bidding for a third World Cup overall 
title, broke an 8-year record on the circuit's longest downhill course and 
widened his lead over defending champion Pirmin Zurbriggen. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli skied the 4,185-meter run in 2 minutes 26.54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian-born skier completed a 7-day sweep of the two most difficult races 
on the circuit. He won last week on the equally hazardous Hahnenkamm course at 
Kitzbuehel, Austria, the first downhill victory of his 10-year career.

BOYCOTTING SAN JOSE ST. PLAYERS OBTAIN LEGAL COUNSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The 10 San Jose State basketball players who are boycotting practices and games 
in protest of Coach Bill Berry's treatment of them may sue if their 
scholarships are revoked, a lawyer with Melvin M. Belli's firm said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The players, who have accused Berry of "mental cruelty" and refused to practice 
or play again until Berry resigns or is fired, met with attorney Paul Monzione 
Thursday and are scheduled to meet today with Belli, the San Francisco lawyer 
who has been called the "king of torts." Belli did not meet with the players 
earlier because he was out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned that these young men don't lose any of their scholarship 
benefits or their right to play for the school," said Monzione, who termed 
Berry's treatment of the players "shocking" according to what the players had 
told him. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State has backed Berry but has not announced a decision regarding the 
scholarships, which under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules could be 
rescinded before the new semester begins next week, since the players left the 
team voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Before San Jose State lost to Cal State Fullerton Thursday with a makeshift 
team that included four football players, Athletic Director Randy Hoffman 
indicated that the scholarships likely will be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
"If a student-athlete makes a decision, they need to be responsible for it," 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated attempts to reach Berry for comment Friday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, the athletic director, backed Berry repeatedly on Thursday, 
acknowledging that last year he had told Berry to "mellow" in his treatment of 
players and officials this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's done that," Hoffman said. "I don't know if it's a requirement for 
athletes to be happy all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Steve Elling and Gary Klein contributed to this story.

<P>
Cal State Fullerton, which snapped a 7-game losing streak Thursday night with 
an 82-60 Big West victory over San Jose State, plays host to Utah State in 
another conference game tonight at 7:30 at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (6-8 overall, 1-4 in the Big West), are led by forward Cedric 
Ceballos, who scored 23 points and had a career-high 20 rebounds against San 
Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State, which won the conference tournament last season and was one of the 
favorites -- along with Nevada Las Vegas -- to win the conference title this 
season, was routed by the Rebels, 102-80, Thursday night in Las Vegas. The 
Aggies (6-10, 4-3) are led by guard Reid Newey, who scored 22 points against

Tom Lewis and Marty Wilson each made a pair of free throws in the final 39 
seconds to lift Pepperdine to a 69-64 West Coast Athletic Conference victory 
over Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (11-7), who remained in a 3-way tie for the WCAC lead with St. Mary's 
and Loyola Marymount at 3-0, trailed by as many as 10 points in the first half 
and never led by more than 7 after intermission against the Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (1-15, 1-2), trying for its second victory in a row after breaking its 
21-game losing streak last weekend, led, 35-25, with 5 minutes to go in the 
first half and still had a 37-33 advantage at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine took a 56-49 lead in the second half, but Portland came back to tie 
the score at 57-57 on Steve Hutchinson's rebound basket with 4:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
A slam dunk by forward Dexter Howard and Lewis' 18-footer boosted the 
Pepperdine lead to 61-57 with 3:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Portland closed within 1 point 3 times, the last at 65-64 on Bart Koenitzer's 
tip-in with 51 seconds to go, but Lewis sank a pair of free throws with 39 
seconds left, and after a Pilot miss, Wilson hit 2 more to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Shann Ferch each scored 15 for Pepperdine, while Lewis added 14. 
Erik Spoelstra scored 14 and Andy Johnson 13 for the Pilots.

Something had to give Friday night at Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion when the St. 
Mary's Gaels played the Santa Clara Broncos. The Gaels were 5-0 in road games 
while the Broncos were 7-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Well, St. Mary's still is undefeated in away games after routing Santa Clara, 
76-48. The Gaels led from start to finish. An early 13-0 run gave them a 17-2 
lead with 11:52 to play in the first half. St. Mary's, which had lost 84 of the 
previous 118 meetings with Santa Clara, led at halftime, 43-25. 
</P>
<P>
Al Lewis scored 14 points and Erick Newman added 12 to lead St. Mary's, which 
remained in a 3-way tie for the West Coast Athletic Conference lead with 
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount at 3-0. The Gaels are 15-1 overall. Santa Clara 
(11-5, 0-3) was led by by Jeffty Connelly with 18 points and Jens Gordon with 
17. 
</P>
<P>
USF 63, U. San Diego 58 -- Both teams were winless in the WCAC going into the 
game at San Francisco, but Kevin Mouton led the Dons to victory over the 
Toreros by scoring 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco (9-7, 1-2) was playing without star center Mark McCathrion, whose 
father died earlier in the week. Joel DeBortoli added 14 points for the Dons.

Fryer, a 6-2 junior who scored a career-high 42 points in last Saturday's 
122-108 loss to DePaul, scored 37 points, and Gathers had 31 points and 13 
rebounds as the Lions beat the Bulldogs for the third straight time. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Loyola a 3-0 WCAC record and kept the Lions (9-6) in a 3-way 
tie for first place with Pepperdine and St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jim McPhee had 34 points and 12 assists, both career highs, and guard 
Doug Spradley scored 26 points for Gonzaga (10-6, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied nine times in the first half, which ended in a 49-49 tie. 
Loyola broke from a 63-63 tie midway through the second half with an 11-2 run 
and never trailed again, although Gonzaga pulled within 99-97 on Spradley's 
3-point shot with 4:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt if we could keep the game at a fast pace, the game would go our way," 
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "Both teams played with a lot of intensity. 
Although there will be some people who won't believe it, our pressure defense 
was a key factor." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said that in addition to his scoring, Fryer came up with a key steal 
late in the game that led to a basket and a 108-99 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, all he was was a straight-up shooter," Westhead said of Fryer. 
"With maturity, he now has those twists and turns that really give opponents a 
lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which makes an average of 9 3-point shots a game, was 8 of 26. For the 
season, the Lions, who have missed more 3-pointers than 5 of the other 7 WCAC 
schools have attempted, are 137 of 372. Fryer was good on 5 of his 15 3-point 
attempts. He leads the conference with 58 3-pointers.

WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA;

<P>
BRIDESMAID GOODBYE HALO FACES 4 IN EL ENCINO

<P>
A week from today, when Alysheba is officially named 1988 horse of the year, 
boosters for Personal Ensign will groan about the undefeated filly's misfortune 
of coming along in the wrong year. 
</P>
<P>
Personal Ensign, whose 7 for 7 record in 1988 would have been good enough to 
win horse-of-the-year honors in most any other year, is not the only filly 
whose career has been ill-timed. Consider Goodbye Halo, who turns up a 
bridesmaid every year and will try to reverse the trend when she makes her 
debut as a 4-year-old today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Goodbye Halo started her career with an 8-length victory at Belmont 
Park. She then won the Demoiselle at Aqueduct by 10 lengths. Sent to trainer 
Charlie Whittingham after that, she won the Hollywood Starlet by 3 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo was kept on the sidelines for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. 
Epitome won the race, clinching the Eclipse Award for best 2-year-old filly, 
with Goodbye Halo finishing second in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
Epitome's overall record hardly compared to Goodbye Halo's -- she had only 1 
victory against maidens in 6 starts before the Breeders' Cup. In retrospect, 
there is little question about who would usually win if the 2 fillies raced 
each other often. Eclipse voters have been unpredictable, but this time they 
considered the Breeders' Cup as everything and gave the title to Epitome. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Goodbye Halo added 4 more major stakes wins to her record. But this 
time she was in a league with Personal Ensign and Kentucky Derby winner Winning 
Colors, and 3 failures on grass -- a surface she will never race on again -- 
dimmed her record. In the Breeders' Cup Distaff, with Personal Ensign beating 
Winning Colors at the wire, Goodbye Halo finished third, only a half-length 
behind the other 2 fillies, a stellar performance that was quickly forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Deservedly, Winning Colors was voted champion 3-year-old filly, with Goodbye 
Halo settling for another second in Eclipse voting. Personal Ensign will lose 
the vote to Alysheba for horse of the year, but she won the title for best 
older filly or mare. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Goodbye Halo will be running against only 4 others in the $100,000 El 
Encino Stakes. Her nemeses from last year are on the sidelines, Personal Ensign 
having been retired and soon to be bred to Mr. Prospector, and Winning Colors 
getting a rest until later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo hasn't won in almost 7 months, but her 5 starts in that stretch 
also deserve footnotes: 3 ill-advised races on grass, that narrow defeat in the 
Breeders' Cup and a fourth-place finish in the Alabama at Saratoga, where she 
bled from the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
In the El Encino, Goodbye Halo will be reunited with Pat Day, the Midwestern 
jockey who hasn't been aboard since they won the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill 
Downs, the day before Winning Colors won the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Santa Anita hopes to resume grass racing with the running of the 
$150,000 San Marcos Handicap at 1 1/4 miles. Track officials closed the turf 
last Monday, in the wake of complaints from owners, trainers and jockeys about 
the condition of the divot-scarred grass course. Two horses that broke down in 
grass races last weekend had to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, jockeys approved the condition of the grass course, which was 
given the chance to dry because of higher temperatures and no rain. 
</P>
<P>
Putting, second to Great Communicator in the Hollywood Turf Cup last week, will 
carry high weight of 120 pounds in the San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
For owner John Valpredo, bad luck came in triplicate the day Feraud broke down 
on Santa Anita's grass course. Feraud, destroyed a few days later, was going to 
be insured for $90,000, Valpredo said, but the policy wasn't completed in time. 
The morning Feraud was injured, a Valpredo filly needed more than 100 stitches 
to repair an injury suffered in a training accident. Later that day, Valpredo 
learned that one of his mares had died at the farm. 
</P>
<P>
The trickle of fines continues against Santa Anita trainers after post-race 
positives for illegal medications. Arthur Hirsch was fined $750 by the stewards 
after his horse, Tip a Sou, was disqualified following a second-place finish in 
a race Jan. 5. . . . Pat Valenzuela, who broke a cheekbone in a spill on Dec. 
28, resumes riding this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Drysdale won another race Friday, giving him 9 victories with only 17 
starters at the meeting. . . . In a national vote by jockeys, Larry Snyder was 
picked as the winner of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. The 46-year-old 
Snyder, winner of 5,855 races, has spent most of his career in the Midwest. The 
award is named after the jockey who died after a spill at Santa Anita in 1946.

Mark McCumber grabbed a share of the lead moments before darkness halted 
second-round play in the $700,000 Phoenix Open golf tournament Friday. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber completed two trips over the windblown TPC course in 133, putting him 
in a tie, at 9 under par, with Billy Glasson. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber, a member of the United States' winning World Cup team last fall, had 
a second-round 69. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hard day. It started in winds and ended in darkness. The last 
two holes I couldn't see the greens," McCumber said. 
</P>
<P>
Glasson, playing in the worst of the gusty winds, shot a 68, which included an 
18-foot birdie putt on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve players, including challenger Ben Crenshaw, did not complete their 
rounds because of darkness. They marked their positions and were scheduled to 
return early this morning to complete second-round play. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw was at 7 under par with 1 hole to go.

BOXING / EARL GUSTKEY;

<P>
BANKE IS GETTING TO PAYOFF PUNCH 5 YEARS AFTER TURNING PROFESSIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Earl Gustkey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Banke, sweat still streaming off his body, stripped tape from his hands 
and marveled at the little warrior he had just beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe that guy," he said. "The harder I hit him, the more he kept 
coming. I was beginning to wonder if I could get him out of there." 
</P>
<P>
But you knew that deep down, he knew he would. You could see it in his eyes, 
even in the one under the long, open cut. 
</P>
<P>
Banke is a hot super-bantamweight. He improved his record to 18-3 after taking 
out Ramiro Adames in 6 rounds one recent night at the Forum, in what might 
stand up as Los Angeles' fight of the year. Or, at least until Banke fights 
again, which could be in May. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after turning pro, the hard-hitting Banke, who earned $4,500 for the 
Adames win, is finally closing in on some medium-big money fights, and the 
boxing people at the Forum would just as soon they be held in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of developing talent here in our tournaments and then having them 
move on to Las Vegas or Atlantic City as soon as they have big names," said 
Forum matchmaker Antonio Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis is trying to sign Banke to a 2-fight deal that could make him a double 
world champion and earn him $100,000 or more. Banke, who fights for Bob 
Richardson's All-Heart Boxing Club in Quail Valley, Calif., has already earned 
$100,000 at the Forum by winning its bantamweight championship tournament last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But here's how the Forum is trying to map out his immediate future. Banke, who 
entered the Adames bout ranked ninth by the World Boxing Council, won a Mickey 
Mouse title by beating Adames, something called the WBC Continental Americas 
super-bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
But there's nothing Mickey Mouse about his next two projected bouts. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis wants to match Banke next with Mexico's Daniel Zaragoza for the latter's 
WBC super-bantamweight championship. At roughly the same time, May, the Forum 
would also like to match Jesus Poll of Venezuela against Juan Jose Estrada, 
champion of the World Boxing Assn.'s junior-featherweight class, which is the 
same weight class as the WBC's super-bantamweight. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, if he beat Zaragoza, would then get the Poll-Estrada winner, and an 
opportunity to add a second marquee title. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, no one except Banke would have predicted any of this. A 
youngster from Azusa, he was a competent amateur, though never a headliner. In 
a 175-bout amateur career, he was sometimes a regional champion, but never a 
national-class boxer. He was not in the 1984 Olympic team picture, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Banke, though, surprised everyone by blossoming as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
"In the amateurs, in 3-round bouts, the idea is to throw as many scoring 
punches as possible," Banke said. "People didn't know I could hit hard until I 
was a pro, when I could set up my weight right, and really deliver a punch." 
</P>
<P>
Banke, setting up in the ring, looks like a mini-Tyson, with his fists carried 
high against his jaw, his feet flat and spread apart. He wings in blows like 
cannon shots. He also has a set-up punch that collapses defenses. 
</P>
<P>
It's a short, hard left hook, delivered low to the rib cage. It has a way of 
exposing chins. Within a week after stopping Adames, Banke was back in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the gym and back on the road," said his trainer, Wes Ramey. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul, like our other fighters, does 6.2 miles every day in 40 minutes or less. 
Paul was in great shape for Adames. He's doing a lot of things correctly right 
now -- he's throwing short, hard punches; his legs are bent just right, and 
he's keeping his weight on top of his feet. Believe me, his best fights are all 
ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hearns was right. The Hit Man tossed out the following at a press 
conference here last week to announce the Sumbu Kalambay-Michael Nunn fight 
March 25: "I know Marvin Hagler is in the gym, training, so I know he's at 
least thinking about coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Hearns' tip was confirmed by a call to Hagler's former co-manager, Pat 
Petronelli, who said Hagler is indeed back in the Petronelli Gym in Brockton, 
Mass., but isn't talking. 
</P>
<P>
"Marvin is running and working out in the gym every day," Petronelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been in here regularly for about a month. He weighs about 169. He hasn't 
said anything to us about wanting to fight again, and we haven't asked him. 
He's pretty busy with his sportswear business. After he works out, he goes into 
an office he uses here to work on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is, if Marvin feels he can get back into shape, he'll sit down and 
talk to us about his plans." 
</P>
<P>
A comeback by Hagler would require promoter Bob Arum to add another bracket to 
his middleweight "tournament." Hearns-Sugar Ray Leonard II is close to being 
made -- June 12 and 22 are the working dates -- and Kalambay vs. Nunn and 
Roberto Duran vs. Iran Barkley, Feb. 24, are set. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Correction: The Weaver triplets -- Floyd, Lloyd and Troy -- are Mike Weaver's 
brothers, not his sons. . . . Paul Gonzales of East Los Angeles, still pursuing 
a world flyweight title fight, has signed to meet unranked Abe Garcia in 
Sacramento Jan. 25. If Gonzales wins, and doesn't get a title fight after 
Garcia, there's talk of a Southland "King of the Flyweights" battle at the 
Irvine Marriott between Gonzales and Ricky Romero of Torrance.

OFF-ROAD GRAN PRIX CIRCUIT OPENS AT ANAHEIM STADIUM 
</P>

<P>
Another competitive race for the manufacturers' cup in the mini- pickup class 
begins at 7:30 tonight at Anaheim Stadium in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road 
Championship Gran Prix. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota has won the cup 6 straight times since its inception in 1983, but a new 
drivers' lineup and some strong competition could end its domination. 
</P>
<P>
Defending mini-pickup class champion Steve Millen has shifted from dirt racing 
to the International Motor Sports Assn. GTO sports car racing. He has been 
replaced on Team Toyota by 20-year-old Robby Gordon of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon was voted the sport's rookie of the year in 1988 and was the youngest 
recipient of the All-American auto racing award. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran teammate Ivan Stewart was second in the series last year, and showed he 
hasn't slowed any by recording the fastest lap (38.04 m.p.h.) in a practice 
session Wednesday on the man-made, one-third-mile course that includes 700 
truckloads of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Evans, factory driver for Jeep, and Roger Mears, factory driver for 
Nissan, are expected to be strong contenders after struggling in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Evans won at Denver and was leading at Las Vegas before he crashed in the final 
events of the 1988 season. Mears has won only 2 stadium races since 1985, but 
he has taken over operating controls of the team and recently completed a new 
5-acre test center in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda, a close runner-up to Toyota last year, has disbanded its team because of 
disputes with promoters over restrictions on its engines, but veteran driver 
Glenn Harris will continue to drive a Mazda for a tire manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Thompson of Sunset Beach blew two engines testing his Chevrolet last week 
and will be limited with last year's equipment that has 15 less horsepower than 
his 1989 model truck. 
</P>
<P>
The series also features classes in 1600cc dune buggy, 4-wheel All-Terrain 
Vehicle, odyssey, ultrastock and motorcycle racing.

EUROPEANS TO DISCUSS DUTIES ON U.S. GOODS 
</P>

European foreign ministers will likely delay implementation of tough duties on 
some U.S. imports in an effort to defuse tensions over a ban on hormone-treated 
meat from America, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Community will meet 
Monday to discuss the conflict sparked Jan. 1 when the trading bloc banned 
imports of U.S. meat from cattle treated with growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
The United States retaliated by imposing, also on Jan. 1, higher tariffs on a 
variety of products from the community, also known as the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
Nico Wegter, a community spokesman, said the foreign ministers will be asked to 
implement as soon as possible counter-measures that would slap stiff duties on 
American dried fruit and walnuts. The package was tentatively approved earlier 
this month by the governments' representatives in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
But other officials said a number of countries apparently want to defer setting 
an effective date in order to give the two sides more time to resolve the 
dispute, particularly with George Bush taking office as President. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Untreated Meat 
</P>
<P>
Many countries, said one official, want to "see if there's still a possibility 
of getting the new Administration moving." 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the ministers may also want to 
await the outcome of a Feb. 8 meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. The EC intends to ask the 96-nation GATT to declare the U.S. retaliatory 
measures in violation of the international body's rules. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, officials have been following reports that some small U.S. 
slaughterhouses and packaging firms have offered to ship untreated meat to 
Europe. "It is an encouraging sign and should be explored to see how far this 
can go," said an official. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the officials said, it was likely the foreign ministers would 
decide to continue watching the situation and discuss it again in February or 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was touched off by an EC decision to prohibit for health reasons 
meat from animals treated with growth hormones. The United States -- which 
exports about $100 million of such meat to the EC annually -- contends that the 
use of certain hormones to fatten animals, a common practice among American 
farmers, does not pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has urged the Europeans to let GATT's Committee on Technical 
Barriers to Trade, also known as the Standards Code Committee, decide the issue 
on scientific grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The EC has insisted that GATT should consider only whether the community has 
the right to impose such a ban to protect the health of its consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But there was some hint the community was shifting its position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1-Year Delay on Ban 
</P>
<P>
Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trading official, told the European Parliament, 
the community's legislative body, on Thursday that scientific factors could be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
"One doesn't need to exclude the scientific judgment in the total framework of 
this problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wegter denied that Andriessen's remarks represented a shift, but other 
officials saw the comments as marking a weakening of the European position. 
</P>
<P>
The meat ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the trading bloc agreed 
to a one-year delay. The EC refused further U.S. appeals for a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the United States imposed 100% duties on boneless beef, pork 
hams and shoulders and a variety of other European products. The sanctions are 
worth about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to allow a grace period until the end of January for 
sanctioned products to enter their borders. This applies to goods in transit 
before Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed goods represent a tiny fraction of the estimated $166 billion in 
trade last year between the United States and the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
Common Market members are: France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United 
Kingdom.

BRAZIL SAYS MORATORIUM ON DEBT PAYMENTS IS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAO PAULO, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Jose Sarney said in an interview published Friday that Brazil would 
declare a new moratorium on its foreign debt if it is unable to meet 
obligations to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Sarney told the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper that the government would not 
rule out declaring a moratorium on Brazil's $115-billion debt, or at least 
using this possibility as a way to pressure creditors during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The payment of the foreign debt is a logical question. If there's money, pay. 
If there's no money, don't pay," Sarney said. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil declared a moratorium on $67 billion of its commercial debt in February, 
1987, but ended it last year after reaching a new agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that Brazil is on the verge of a new debt moratorium was fueled by 
statements by Finance Minister Mailson Nobrega that Brazil could suspend 
interest payments if reserves fell to a critical level. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Sarney said Brazil's level of reserves was at a "difficult 
point." 
</P>
<P>
"The creditors know the situation and they know better than anyone that the 
payments will have to remain within the limits of our reality. There is no 
magic," the president said. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has said the country's reserves are about $5 billion. 
Bankers estimate them at $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The debt problem has also come to the fore since the government last week 
launched a new economic austerity plan designed to beat inflation of nearly 
1,000%. 
</P>

"Of what use are measures to control inflation, the public deficit and the 
internal debt if they are not accompanied by measures in the foreign area? 
Everything is narrowly connected," Sarney said.

BUILDERS PREDICT A 7.4% DROP IN HOUSING STARTS

<P>
The nation's home builders on Friday forecast a 7.4% decline in housing starts 
and a 5% drop in new home sales this year, continuing a three-year decline. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast by the National Assn. of Home Builders came a day after the 
Commerce Department reported 1988 housing starts of 1.49 million, an 8.2% 
decrease from 1987's 1.62 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, NAHB economist David Seiders said housing starts will 
remain above 1 million at an estimated 1.38 million. "Frankly, that's not a bad 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seiders and other economists appearing Friday at the NAHB's annual meeting in 
Atlanta said that they expected the Federal Reserve Board, the nation's central 
bank, to maintain a tight rein on credit, causing interest rates to rise early 
in the year to restrain inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is destined to slow down in 1989. It has to," said Seiders, 
although he added that "it would take a policy mistake" to bring about a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of adjustable rate mortgages since the last round of rising 
interest rates also presents a new problem, the economists said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Michaelis, the chief economist for the forest products firm Weyerhaeuser 
Co., said mortgage holders could find themselves paying as much as $10 billion 
more in house payments as increasing rates are reflected in their loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people have had a positive experience" with ARMs, he said, but now will 
face higher payments. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital, admitted that the 
phenomenon may cause delinquency rates to increase, but said the overall effect 
is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
The economists estimated that ARMs account for about $500 billion of the total 
$2-trillion mortgage debt.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said the average interest rate on 
one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages rose to the highest level in more than 2 
1/2 years this week. The average rate on the most popular type of 
adjustable-rate mortgage, the kind with caps on how high the rate can go, was 
8.58%, up from 8.54% a week earlier. That was the highest level since May 9, 
1986, when the rate was 8.59%, the agency said. The average rate on 30-year, 
fixed-rate mortgages this week was 10.71%, down from 10.81% a week before.

ROBERT HILBURN: WILL TV WIN SPOT IN HALL OF FAME?

TV or not TV? 
</P>
<P>
That's one question facing -- and dividing -- the 37-member board of directors 
of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, whose annual induction dinner has become the 
record industry's most exclusive gala. 
</P>
<P>
A second question: After four years of being held at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel 
here, should the dinner be moved -- at least for one year -- to Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
The probable answer to both questions, according to a Times survey of key board 
members this week: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
The nine board members who were questioned -- including seven of the 10 
executive committee members -- thought it desirable to hold an induction dinner 
in Los Angeles, possibly as early as next January. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Krasnow, chairman of Elektra Records and induction dinner committee 
chairman, said after the 4th annual dinner Wednesday night that he favors an 
event in Los Angeles to give the West Coast a "greater sense of involvement" in 
the Hall of Fame -- a nonprofit organization designed to honor rock music's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
(Ground breaking on a $48-million building in Cleveland to house the Hall of 
Fame is scheduled for next year.) 
</P>
<P>
Though there are nearly a dozen Los Angeles record executives on the Hall of 
Fame board of directors (including David Geffen, Berry Gordy Jr., Quincy Jones, 
Jerry Moss, Mo Ostin and Joe Smith), the Hall has a heavy New York emphasis. 
All 10 members of the executive committee, for instance, are based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour Stein, president of Sire Records and president of the board of 
directors, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to get them totally involved as soon as possible and 
what better way than to have the dinner on their home ground?" 
</P>
<P>
The television matter is considerably more delicate. 
</P>
<P>
While board members are sensitive to complaints that the annual affair has an 
elitist tone ("a party for just 1,000 people in tuxedos," quipped one 
director), most fear that turning it into a television special would destroy 
much of the evening's informal character. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the dinner is an unusually warm affair that attracts rock's biggest 
stars. Not only are the induction speeches frequently as eloquent as the 
artists' best music, but the musicians always engage in a lively, largely 
spontaneous jam at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Jann Wenner, executive vice president of the Hall of Fame board of directors 
and editor-publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, is the most outspoken proponent 
of a television tie-in. He predicted this week that the board of directors will 
approve a television agreement, quite likely in time for the fifth annual 
ceremonies next January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just such a stunning event that it is wrong not to let (more) people see 
it, and I think we can come up with a format that doesn't destroy the 
(integrity) of the evening," he said in an interview Thursday. "There are 
plenty of really tasteful, talented producers or directors to do it. If it 
doesn't work, we don't do it the following year. But we ought to try." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1,100 industry insiders who paid up to $1,250 a ticket for the sold-out 
soiree Wednesday, the Hall of Fame induction dinner was most certainly a night 
of memories. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Pete Townshend and Tina Turner were among the 
pop notables who showed up to salute the latest crop of inductees, including 
performers Stevie Wonder, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, Dion and the 
late Otis Redding. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Hall of Fame has been able to get such a star-studded turnout 
since it was begun in 1986 is that there is no overt commercialization. The 
artists are free to let their hair down. The affair is videotaped, but only for 
the Hall of Fame archives. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid it (television) will spoil it," Seymour Stein said in an interview 
this week. "I feel we are putting ourselves and this wonderful thing at risk. 
Would Bruce Springsteen feel free to come and get on stage if he knew it was a 
television show?" 
</P>
<P>
Though other board members -- including Michael Leon, A&amp;M Records senior 
vice president, concert producer Bill Graham, Springsteen manager Jon Landau, 
and Bob Altshuler, CBS Records vice president of press and public affairs -- 
expressed similar concerns, most said they believe a show is inevitable, or at 
least a one-time trial. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the show would be a source of income for the foundation. The 
board of directors reportedly received a $1 million-plus offer from a cable 
network for the rights to this year's dinner. But the issue of "sharing" the 
event with the public appears to be an even larger factor in making the board 
lean toward giving television a one-year trial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Allen Grubman, secretary-treasurer of the board of directors, said: 
"The reason we'd do it isn't the funds, but to give the public a chance to see 
(the ceremony). The question is whether we can have television involved and 
still (maintain) the spirit we had Wednesday night." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Freston, president of entertainment for the MTV Networks and a member of 
the Hall of Fame executive board, said the cable channel has proposed to tape 
the entire four-hour show and present it in its entirety at a later date. Betty 
Bitterman, vice president of original programming at HBO, said HBO is also 
talking with the Hall of Fame directors about a show, perhaps an edited 
two-hour special. 
</P>
<P>
Said A&amp;M's Leon: "I have reservations about television, but we also realize 
the importance of making the public feel part of what we're doing. After all, 
it's the public that really creates these heroes. They are the ones who respond 
to the music that makes it all possible." 
</P>
<P>
REGARDING THE LOS ANGELES MOVE: Some Hall of Fame board members said it might 
make sense to switch to Los Angeles in a year when several West Coast bands are 
being inducted. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Hall of Fame guidelines, which declare an artist becomes eligible 25 
years after the release of his or her first record, several influential 
California artists will become eligible during the next five years. Among them: 
the Byrds, Doors, Mamas and Papas, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Janis 
Joplin, Buffalo Springfield and Creedence Clearwater Revival. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's ceremony, however, is likely to be dominated by British acts. Among 
the eligible bands: the Who, the Kinks and the Yardbirds. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION IN LOS ANGELES: Stevie Wonder will headline a benefit on March 5 at 
Universal Amphitheatre for the Minnie Riperton Fund of Concern Foundation and 
Concern II. Tickets go on sale Sunday. . . . Burning Spear, Judy Mowatt and 
Pato Banton will be among the acts at the eighth annual Bob Marley Day 
festivities, Feb. 5 at the Long Beach Arena. . . . The Stylistics, the 
Dramatics and the Chi-Lites play the Celebrity Theatre Feb. 24 and the Wiltern 
Feb. 26. . . . Amy Grant will be at the Forum on March 2.

PLAYWRIGHT USES 'MORE LIGHT' TO FUEL HIS IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's nightmare time at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
A 16th-Century Pope goes to sleep and dreams of heaven in Snoo Wilson's 
sociological fantasy, "More Light," opening tonight at the Lex Theatre in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Along for the bumpy ride are Shakespeare (played by a black woman); Queen 
Elizabeth I; royal astrologer Dr. Dee; a forger named Kelly; a barmaid born to 
a witch and Bacchus, and the renowned freethinker/period-pop hero Giordano 
Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
"The play is introduced by the Pope," explained the sandy-haired and 
mild-mannered British writer, who was drawn to the real-life story of Bruno, a 
Franciscan monk who dabbled in various kinds of magic, was excommunicated and 
eventually burned at the stake for heresy. "In the Pope's dream -- which I see 
as a sort of Tom &amp; Jerry nightmare -- he has to catch Bruno, have him 
brought back and burned properly." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old writer (who was christened Andrew James Wilson -- "but I lost 
those names at an early age; even my American Express card says 'Snoo' ") 
became interested in Bruno in 1984, when the Royal Shakespeare Company asked 
him to write an adaptation of the monk's commedia dell'arte play "Il 
Candelario" ("The Candlemaker"). 
</P>
<P>
"It's really three plays knitted into one, about five hours long -- and has no 
discernible structure," he mused. "There's some debunking of hypocritical 
attitudes, a couple of chunks of cuckoldry -- but it's basically very long and 
not terribly good. I mean, I'm sure it is good, but it hasn't exactly stood up 
to the test of the ages. Bruno was not a man of the theater; he was a man of 
ideas. And he was much more interesting (than his play)." 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Lex production of "More Light" was delayed by a week because 
of the labor dispute between Actors Equity and ATLAS -- a coalition of Equity 
Waiver theater operators. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's last visit to the United States was for the 1988 staging of his and 
Ray Davies' "80 Days" (a musical adaptation of Jules Verne's "Around the World 
in Eighty Days") at the La Jolla Playhouse. An earlier Wilson play, "Vampire," 
was presented in Los Angeles at the tiny City Stage in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of his work has been done in England. 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoys collaborating, much of Wilson's writing is done alone. "You 
have to trust your nose," he noted, "that certain things are hot. I'm an 
imaginationist. You can still play by the rules of the theater; the rules of 
the theater are much kinder than you can possibly imagine. I mean, they do 
allow for a certain amount of play. For instance, there's a point in this where 
the Pope gets turned into a fly and falls into Shakespeare's inkwell. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturalism can be sublime," he allowed, "but it's just not my cup of tea. This 
play speaks to my own escapism, my own fears. It's about eternity, the universe 
-- all the stuff that turned Bruno on. For me, the cutting edge of drama is 
being able to turn things around, so people can see it from the other end. 
Sure, I want them to be engrossed. They have to be, because the first act is 
one hour and 12 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has just written a new play, "We, the People," about a woman who 
thinks she's the Queen of England, has no trouble being labeled a "political" 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am political," he said seriously. "I can talk the hind legs off of 
freethinking and ideals versus repression and structure. (Even in Bruno's 
story) there are parallels. I'm not Italian or Catholic. But the problems are 
the same: the individual versus the state. I think it's an endless equation -- 
and something the current power in England has got badly wrong." Yet he remains 
optimistic: "Bruno had an extraordinarily positive attitude toward the 
universe. I'm not averse to thinking thoughts like that."

'MUNCHAUSEN'S' MARKETING WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"He won't get far on hot air and fantasy," sniffs The Right Ordinary Horatio 
Jackson in the upcoming movie "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." 
</P>
<P>
Horatio Jackson, a symbol of the chilling winds of reason and rationality 
blowing into the 18th Century, was deriding his fantastical, whimsical nemesis 
-- the Baron von Munchausen. He could just as well have been echoing Terry 
Gilliam's modern-day detractors. 
</P>
<P>
With "Baron Munchausen," the controversial director of "Time Bandits" and 
"Brazil" has delivered to Columbia Pictures the most expensive, ambitious film 
of his career, a two-hour fantasy epic exploding with special effects. Despite 
a massive advertising campaign, the film opened in Germany Dec. 8 to lukewarm 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the European-produced film had barely arrived at Columbia's Burbank 
studio when some Hollywood skeptics began predicting its early demise at the 
box office. (Though that didn't stop Joel Silver, producer of the hits "Die 
Hard" and "Lethal Weapon," from recruiting Gilliam to direct his upcoming 
"Watchmen," a film being adapted from the comic book.) 
</P>
<P>
"Baron Munchausen," which Columbia has screened privately for select 
journalists and industry officials, puts Gilliam's awesome imagination on vivid 
display. But even Columbia executives concede that it won't be easy to market 
an 18th- Century fantasy starring a 10-year-old girl (Sarah Polley) and an 
English actor without much name recognition here (John Neville). 
</P>
<P>
By contract, the studio cannot even advertise the film's biggest name, Robin 
Williams, who makes an uncredited appearance as a moon king whose head spins 
off. 
</P>
<P>
The film presents Columbia President Dawn Steel with her most challenging 
marketing job since she assumed control of the studio a year and a half ago. It 
was her predecessor, David Puttnam, who agreed to buy the theatrical and TV 
rights to the film in most countries, including the States, and who convinced 
Columbia's RCA video arm to buy the video rights. But it will be up to Steel to 
recoup the company's $20.5-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining production costs were absorbed by European investors and Film 
Finances, the company that insured "Baron Munchausen's" original $23.5-million 
budget against cost overruns. Film Finances now estimates the movie's direct 
cost at "less than" $40 million. But a Film Finances official would not be more 
specific, nor would he provide a figure on such additional indirect costs as 
interest payments and overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Columbia's new marketing team huddled to assess marketing strategies 
for the film. It was the first week on the job for Buffy Shutt, the studio's 
new marketing president and her equally new executive vice president for 
marketing, Kathy Jones. Last fall, the studio brought in Susan Pile, formerly 
at Fox, to act as a marketing and publicity consultant on the film. All three 
women worked with Steel when she was at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia executives are attempting to look beyond traditional marketing 
notions, using terms like "psychographics" instead of "demographics" to 
emphasize their efforts to target an audience with the same mind-set, rather 
than targeting specific age groups or income levels. As one studio official put 
it: "The film has multiple audiences that don't split into pure demographic 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia has tentative plans to release "Baron Munchausen" March 10 for 
exclusive showings in 50 to 60 towns and cities that are likely to be 
receptive. That includes college towns where comedy troupe Monty Python (of 
which Gilliam is a member) is popular, and areas where residents turned out in 
big numbers for "Time Bandits" in 1981. The studio also is preparing research 
screenings to test the reactions of children. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is an extraordinary movie and we are supporting it," Steel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's cause for concern: The film opened six weeks ago to mixed 
reviews in West Germany and unenthusiastic audience reception. The $40-million 
investment in the film, said the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, "can be seen every 
minute . . . (the film) surges and boils and roars and sizzles." The camera 
moves as if "the creditors were looking over its shoulder," the magazine added. 
</P>
<P>
The national daily paper Frankfurter Allgemeine, in its review, said: "During 
the longer stretches, one gets the impression someone has seen lots of Fellini 
films, and then said: 'I can do the same, but better.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Suddeutsche Zeitung of Munich commented: "It is a hectic film, with hardly 
a pause for breath. It is a noisy film that one can't really believe, even 
though it is about Baron Muenchausen ." 
</P>
<P>
But TZ, another paper in Munich, called it a "really beautiful, exciting fairy 
tale . . . fast and witty." 
</P>
<P>
Since its Dec. 8 opening there in 252 theaters -- considered a wide release in 
West Germany -- the film has dropped from third to 15th among its competition 
and has grossed only $2.4 million, according to Erich Kocian, editor of 
Blickpunkt: Film. In neighboring Austria, the film sank so badly after the 
first week that its distributor, Neue Constantin, stopped reporting its 
grosses. 
</P>
<P>
All that despite Neue Constantin's massive advertising and publicity campaign, 
which blanketed both Germany and Austria. "The papers and magazines were full 
of advertisements," said Kocian. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the film's fans, like Playboy critic Bruce Williamson, contend that 
German audiences were more hostile because the folklore of Baron Munchausen -- 
who in real life was a yarn-spinning soldier for Frederick the Great -- is an 
integral part of German culture. Some Germans would be bored by the idea of the 
film, Williamson said in an interview. Others might be offended because it 
didn't conform to their own notions about the baron. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the film is generating a mixed reaction among the handful of 
critics who have seen it -- much as Gilliam's earlier films did. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, whose review appears in the April Playboy, said he thought the 
movie was "terrific and imaginative." GQ's Kenneth Turan said in an interview 
that he loved the film's "richness . . . Gilliam has a really unique view of 
fantasy." Both critics had praised Gilliam's previous films. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollywood's two trade papers, Daily Variety and the Hollyood Reporter -- 
the first major American publications to print reviews -- were not impressed. 
Variety's Todd McCarthy complained that the film "falls short in wit" while the 
Reporter's Duane Byrge decried it as a "noisy and overly abstruse 
fantasy-adventure." Variety flatly stated that the film "has no chance of even 
approaching break-even." 
</P>
<P>
Another cause for concern at Columbia are the results of two market research 
screenings conducted last October in Paramus, N.J., and Roosevelt Field, N.Y. 
While some in the audience liked the film, others walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, however, dismisses those results, noting that his films always defy 
traditional Hollywood marketing precepts. "You've got to prepare an audience 
for it," Gilliam said during a recent telephone interview from his London home. 
</P>
<P>
"Baron Munchausen" has been plagued by production problems and bad publicity 
for more than a year. The cost overruns on its original $23.5-million budget 
posed the most serious troubles, but there were others. In the midst of 
production hold-ups, the film's best-known actor, Sean Connery, walked out on 
his role. (He was later replaced by Robin Williams.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the film is now the target of a lawsuit from producer Allan A. 
Buckhantz, who owns the rights to the original 1942 German film based on the 
baron's life. Buckhantz, who has spent 20 years trying to remake that film, 
accuses Columbia of copyright infringement. Columbia maintains that the film 
and its title are based on German folk tales in the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
In December, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered Columbia to put a 
disclaimer on Gilliam's film and its advertisements -- pending a trial on 
Buchkantz's allegations. The disclaimer requirement, stating that Gilliam's 
film is not a remake of the 1942 German classic, applies internationally, but 
not in the States. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gilliam has nothing but kind words about Columbia's handling of "Baron 
Munchausen." That's a switch for a director who has plenty of reasons for what 
he calls his "hate-hate relationship with Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam's 1981 "Time Bandits," which cost only $5 million to make, was turned 
down by every major studio in Hollywood. Avco Embassy Pictures finally picked 
it up and the film went on to become a moderate hit, grossing $42 million at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil," Gilliam's next film, became the source of a public feud between the 
director and its distributor, Universal Pictures, which wanted to edit it to 
make it shorter and more light-hearted. (Universal's version of "Brazil" 
recently aired on TV for the first time.) 
</P>
<P>

production of "Baron Munchausen," Gilliam may be feeling a little nostalgic

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CHANGING OF THE GUARD A BREEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Hail to the chief. 
</P>
<P>
He'd been at the White House many years, not without controversy. He had many 
fans, but he also had countless detractors and enemies. They accused him of 
manipulating the TV camera, of not knowing what he was talking about, of making 
a fool of himself, of being too rigid, of being too superficial, of being too 
narrow, of being too much of an actor. They even made jokes about his hair. 
</P>
<P>
But now the inauguration is over, so America won't have Sam Donaldson to kick 
around anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's transition of power from Ronald Reagan to George Bush in the White 
House was accompanied by a transition of power from Donaldson to Brit Hume on 
ABC's White House beat. 
</P>
<P>
Both transitions were peaceful and orderly. 
</P>
<P>
As ABC's Peter Jennings put it Friday just before Bush was to take the oath of 
office: "This is the end of the Reagan/Donaldson Administration." 
</P>
<P>
But not all of the Reagan/Donaldson prominence. While working on a possible 
magazine series for ABC and continuing as a regular on "This Week With David 
Brinkley," Donaldson will surely be even more visible than Reagan. What else is 
new? 
</P>
<P>
During his 12 years of covering the White House, Donaldson became at once the 
most famous correspondent in TV history and a controversial metaphor for the 
ever-swelling imperial mediacy. Just as his microphone became almost an 
extension of his right hand, Donaldson's regular stand-ups from the White House 
fixed him as a physical -- although not a philosophical -- extension of the 
presidency. Perhaps, more than any other journalist, he has symbolized the 
electronic media's growing influence in politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
So, if Reagan-to-Bush was akin to "a father turning over his family business to 
his son," as CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl noted Friday, the same could be 
said of Donaldson-to-Hume. And that reporting business -- given its instant 
accessibility to the public on a regular basis -- is one of enormous 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
"A new breeze is blowing," President Bush said in his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
A calm breeze. As many TV reporters noted Friday, the very nature of the 
inauguration itself epitomized an exhilarating component of American democracy. 
"It is an ennobling thing to see," NBC's John Chancellor observed about "this 
orderly, decent, civilized transfer of power." He added: "There you see it on 
your screens." 
</P>
<P>
Some of us could see it on our screens. Too few of us. 
</P>
<P>
The drafters of the 20th Amendment obviously did not foresee televised 
inaugurations when they prescribed a date rather than a day as the start of new 
presidential and vice-presidential terms. Hence, schoolchildren and those who 
worked outside the home Friday were excluded from watching this "ennobling 
thing" that should have been available to all Americans. Doesn't inauguration 
day deserve national-holiday status? The awesome irony here is that somehow 
more Americans will watch Sunday's Super Bowl than will have watched George 
Herbert Walker Bush be sworn in as 41st President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Including the pre-inaugural pomp and post-inaugural parade, the event was a TV 
spectacular that lasted much of the day, producing not only magical pictures 
but also the inevitable last-minute Reagan/Bush comparisons and forecasts for 
the new White House. 
</P>
<P>
Energizing atmospheric changes almost always accompany such transfers, however. 
So the Bush term and the traditional honeymoon accorded new Presidents began 
simultaneously, with TV analysts mostly pouring on verbal confetti and 
submerging negatives in the euphoria of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the inevitable trivia leading to the inaugural address of the 
pork rind-loving Bush. "Pork rind -- what are they?' ABC's David Brinkley 
asked. "You know what bacon is -- just use your imagination," Donaldson said. 
Jennings said he still didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Dan Rather joked on CBS about having pictures of the Bush limo's license 
plates being changed. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor gave his assessment of Vice President Dan Quayle, finding him not 
"the airhead . . . that people said he is." Added Chancellor: "People in our 
business have gotten the Dan Quayle story wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Contrasting with that was Quayle's appearance this week on "CBS This Morning," 
where Kathleen Sullivan asked him about a campaign where he often was ridiculed 
as the kind of guy who might walk from the men's room with a piece of toilet 
paper stuck to his shoe. In all straight-faced seriousness -- no joke intended 
-- he replied: "The campaign was a great experience. I don't wish that 
experience on anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was Rather or Jennings and Brinkley or Tom Brokaw and Chancellor 
with Bryant Gumbel on NBC, there was something comforting about the words of 
anchors on this particular day. They, too, are voices of continuity, rather 
like electronic bureaucrats of the airwaves whose careers somehow become our 
most visible unifying links between presidential administrations. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the passing of the baton to Bush from Reagan, ABC's Jennings 
recalled what Jimmy Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, had written in 
his book "Crisis" about how abruptly the trappings of power vanish once a 
President leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
Right up to the moment of Reagan's swearing-in, Carter had entertained hopes 
that America's hostages in Iran would somehow be released. Immediately after 
the Reagan inauguration, Jordan called the White House situation room for an 
update on the hostages, but was told that "classified information is no longer 
available to you" because only moments earlier Carter had ceased being 
President. Period. Exclamation point. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Reagan had ceased being President, Sam Donaldson ceased being 
ABC's White House correspondent, and watched perhaps for the last time as 
Reagan and Nancy walked toward a deafening chopper. 
</P>
<P>
"Any final thoughts?" a familiar voice shouted at Reagan. But the former 
President didn't seem to hear Donaldson's final question. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jennings welcomed Hume to his new White House beat. "Peter," began 
Hume, "I'd of course like to thank Sam . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The new breeze blows.

HOW TO GET A RUNNING START ON SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been called the largest pregame party this side of Miami. It could be 
called the Doo Dah of foot races. 
</P>
<P>
But it is best known as the Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10K Run and Fitness 
Expo. Everyone from the serious runner to the serious partier will feel a part 
of this event. There are no age restrictions, costumes are encouraged, and 
there's $4,600 to be won -- but set your alarm. The party begins at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Awards will be given to the top three finishers in each age class and in 
wheelchair and baby buggy jogger divisions (men and women). 
</P>
<P>
The centipede and six-pack divisions (groups of 10 or 6 runners connected by a 
common costume) will also compete for a $500 prize, which will go to the high 
school athletic program of the team's choice. There are no eligibility 
requirements for this race, except maybe a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
For the overall winners, $1,000, $500 and $300 will be awarded in men's and 
women's divisions. World-class runners Steve Cram of England and Alejandro Cruz 
of Mexico are signed up to compete, along with Jacqueline Hansen of Santa 
Monica, whose influence helped get the women's marathon and 10,000-meter races 
into the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Runners and spectators can examine or purchase health products and services, 
clothing, food and drink at the Fitness Expo, open 6-11 a.m., just west of the 
race starting point. 
</P>
<P>
The racing begins at 7:50 a.m. on North Harbor Drive at Beryl Street in Redondo 
Beach, and will end about 9:30 a.m. -- in plenty of time for football fans to 
see the opening kickoff of Super Bowl XXIII. The $16 entry fee includes a 
T-shirt. For pre-registration or information, call (213) 376-6913.

A HEADS-UP BOAT TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
GAGGLES OF GEESE, THOUSANDS OF DUCKS, A MULTITUDE OF SHORE AND LAND BIRDS -- 
AND, FINALLY, A SOARING EAGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Way out on Lake Cachuma, somewhere between the call of the loon and the honk of 
the Canadian goose, there is the amazing spiel of naturalist Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"At Lake Cachuma we have seeds that walk, spiders that fly, plants that catch 
fish and trees that predict rain," Taylor says to his Eagle Tour passengers 
aboard the Cachuma Queen, "and there are 276 varieties of birds, including 
three dozen species of waterfowl on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
But only one Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's tour-boat passengers are surprised when, in the middle of the lake, he 
cuts the outboard. Soon they will be even more surprised when Taylor begins 
discourses on such topics as capitalism and conservation, differences between 
goldeneyes and common mergansers, the natural history of Spanish moss and how 
to cook a coot. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, passengers on the bobbing boat savor the quiet of the lake 
and the reflection of the Santa Ynez Mountains on the water's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor smiles. To say he had a captive audience is supreme understatement. With 
an actor's instinct, the naturalist stretches out his Harold Pinter-like 
dramatic pause until his passengers begin to fidget. He then begins his first 
discourse of the day about Lake Cachuma, which is just northwest of Santa 
Barbara: 
</P>
<P>
"Who's the best fisherman on the lake?" Taylor asks. 
</P>
<P>
"The cormorant," answers a young woman, who, judging from the way she clutches 
her high-powered binoculars, bird checklist and Peterson "Field Guide to 
Western Birds," is a serious bird watcher indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Good guess," Taylor declares. "The cormorant is a big eater, excellent at 
diving for fish. And extremely smart. I swear that bird knows when the trout 
truck arrives and where we'll stock the lake. But actually, the cormorant is 
the third-best fisherman around here." 
</P>
<P>
"The eagle," answers a safari-suited fellow who looks as if he had stepped from 
the pages of the Banana Republic catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Another good guess," Taylor says. "The bald eagle's feet are adapted for 
fishing. The eagle has little bumps on its toes so that when it swoops down to 
get a fish swimming close to the lake's surface, the bird can hold onto its 
dinner. The eagle is the second-best fisherman on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
The sly grin working at the corners of Taylor's mouth and the twinkle in his 
eyes lets the passengers know they've been had. "Yeah," he says with mock 
bravado. "You're looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
Groans and laughter are overpowered by the roar of the outboard as Taylor 
throttles the Cachuma Queen toward the north shore. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the eagle and the cormorant, and with all kidding 
aside, Taylor may very well be the best fisherman on the lake. As a teen-ager, 
he won several national casting titles. These days, he teaches "The Art and 
Science of Fly-Fishing," both "academically" at UCLA and "hands-on" in the 
wilds of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a mountain of a man with a winning grin, may be entertaining to tour 
passengers, but he's anything but to the lake's rule-breakers when he finds 
them fishing in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor came to be a park ranger rather late in life because, he says, "I was 
spending too much time in the corporate world and not enough time in the 
natural world." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the better part of two decades as a salesman for a sporting goods 
distributor before becoming Lake Cachuma Recreation Area's park naturalist 
seven years ago. Early attempts to market his tours as water nature trails and 
wildlife cruises were not very successful. Then the eagles discovered Lake 
Cachuma and Taylor and county park officials had a product to market. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor stops the boat again. "This is a free-enterprise lake," he declares. 
"Fees collected for day use, camping and tours completely pay for this park, 
and no local tax dollars have to be collected." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers, expecting to learn about fish, not free enterprise, are a bit 
baffled. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for your support," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor thinks capitalism, in the manner that it's practiced at Lake Cachuma, 
can promote conservation. Fees collected from wildlife-watching tours could go 
to help preserve animals and their habitat. Whale watchers helped save the 
whale, elephant-seal watchers helped save the elephant seal, and perhaps eagle 
watchers can help save the eagle, Taylor reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, on this overcast Friday morning, the eagles are elusive. True, the 
passengers already have sighted gaggles of geese, thousands of ducks and a 
multitude of shore and land birds, but Taylor feels compelled to provide at 
least one glimpse of an eagle on any Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are they?" Taylor mutters under his breath as he pilots the boat into 
isolated inlets and scans the high crags and snags where the eagles roost. 
</P>
<P>
America's national bird migrates south from the Pacific Northwest and western 
Canada to the warmer climate and more abundant food sources of Central and 
Southern California. Eagles often winter in the same spots preferred by 
migrating waterfowl -- the state's inland lakes such as Cachuma -- where food 
is plentiful and human intrusion is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Cachuma's eagles arrive in November or December and stay until mid-March. 
Wildlife experts believe that birds wintering at Lake Cachuma come from the San 
Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declining Population 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, there were nesting pairs of bald eagles in 24 
California counties. By 1950, only eight counties could count reproducing 
pairs, the decrease partially attributable to the use of DDT from the 1940s to 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor cries with a mixture of triumph and relief. "An immature, high 
in that oak tree." 
</P>
<P>
Binoculars are trained on a brownish-black bird, all but camouflaged in the 
branches of the distant tree. The largest raptor in North America (with the 
exception of the captured condors in the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos) is not 
all that majestic from such a distance. 
</P>
<P>
Every Eagle Tour is different, Taylor says. Sometimes passengers get an 
eyeball-to-eyeball look at an eagle perched on a snag near shore. At close 
range, when the observer can see the white head and tail, the large, yellow 
hooked bill and talons, America's national symbol is truly an impressive sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor exclaims. "High in the sky!" 
</P>
<P>
Eagles in flight are beautiful to behold. Unlike some other large birds, eagles 
soar with their wings almost flat. With a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, they create a 
dramatic and distinctive silhouette against the clear winter sky. 
</P>
<P>
And the flight of this eagle on this day has made Taylor a happy man and 
delights the tour-boat passengers. Now he can talk of other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want the lake at first," Taylor confesses. "It (building a dam 
to impound the Santa Ynez River) half-drowned a beautiful valley and it wrecked 
one of the best steelhead fishing rivers in the state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chumash Artifacts 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other people disliked the proposal to form the lake, but when 
water-short Santa Barbara resorted to rationing during 1948, the dam and lake 
were approved by local voters. Congress appropriated funds and the project was 
completed in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The lake also covered up a lot of human history, Taylor says. "My brother and I 
picked up four truckloads of Chumash artifacts and took them over to the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History." 
</P>
<P>
It was the abundance of steelhead trout in the river that brought the Chumash 
to the area and later attracted several generations of anglers. Dedicated 
fishermen say the Santa Ynez River once compared favorably with the Klamath as 
one of the state's best steelhead-fishing rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned with the demise of the trout stream, the California Sport Fishing 
Protection Alliance recently filed a complaint with the State Water Board. The 
alliance wants a study done on how the fishery might be restored. Taylor, too, 
would like to see the wild river of his youth restored, but for now, his 
priority is protecting the lake's 42 miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I regard the lake as a wonderful resource -- as a way to enhance wildlife 
habitat. This is a remarkable place for birds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For beginning bird watchers who've traveled long distances for the chance to 
sight a bald eagle, it's almost bird-watching blasphemy to opine that eagles 
often are not the most intriguing part of the Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are sometimes more delighted by the great multitude of birds -- the 
flocks of geese taking flight or the clouds of canvasbacks traveling in long, 
V-shaped formations. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's the antics of the diving ducks that are most remembered. The 
canvasback, a diving duck with a white back, rusty-red head and long black 
bill, is almost always sighted on the lake. And visitors are all but certain to 
see the bufflehead, one of the smallest diving ducks, a chubby white fellow 
with a black back that buzzes more like a fly than a bird. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Blue Heron 
</P>
<P>
Other divers include the small, brown, pie-billed grebe and its cousin, the 
eared grebe. Because grebes ride stern up in the water, they always seem to be 
in danger of sinking. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's longest-legged resident is the great blue heron. Its long neck, 
regal bearing and great size make it one of the most photogenic of birds, and 
its habit of standing motionless for long periods on one leg make it an easy 
target for amateur photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"Cachuma is a great place for the beginning bird watcher," says Joan Lentz, 
co-author with Judith Young of "Birdwatching: A Guide for Beginners" (Capra 
Press). "There are more than a dozen species of ducks, four species of grebes 
and a couple of loons -- a real wealth of wintering bird life. 
</P>
<P>
"The lake's low water level means you can get fairly close to a lot of water 
birds," Lentz explains, "and don't forget the perching birds in the park's oak 
woodland -- acorn woodpeckers, Western bluebirds, goldfinches, juncos and lots 
of sparrows." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has a breezy approach to bird watching, which may be just what the 
beginner needs to get off to a good start, says author Young, "but, uh, he 
didn't tell his coot story to a boatload of Auduboners, did he?" 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . yes. 
</P>
<P>
"The coot is the Rodney Dangerfield of the bird world," Taylor declares. "It 
doesn't get any respect." 
</P>
<P>
He and the passengers watch one of the gregarious gray, white-billed birds 
skitter over the lake's surface on its huge feet and lunge awkwardly into the 
air. Not only is it a graceless flyer, but it has a grating kakakakaka call. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ugly duckling-like bird is kind of cute and one serious birder 
nearly drops her binoculars when Taylor blithely asks: "Know how to cook a 
coot?" 
</P>
<P>
None of the cooks on board dares hazard a guess. 
</P>
<P>
"First you pluck it, then leave it in a stream overnight. Then you put an apple 
inside the bird and wire it to a split green log. Smoke the coot over a 
campfire 3 1/2 hours or until golden brown." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone on board but the Auduboner realizes Taylor is pulling their legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Then throw away the coot and eat the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Bobcat, fox and coyote prowl Cachuma's shoreline. About 70 beaver families live 
by the lake. Unlike their river-dwelling cousins, Cachuma's beavers don't build 
dams. Instead, they occupy burrows in the mud banks. 
</P>
<P>
While much wildlife inhabits the lake's shores, a few visitors expect a thrill 
at every turn. "Some visitors expect the Disneyland jungle boat ride," Taylor 
complains. "There aren't any pop-up rhinos and recorded bird calls out here. 
It's all real." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's Nature's Way' 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes too real. 
</P>
<P>
On some occasions, the natural history lesson comes from Charles Darwin rather 
than Walt Disney. During one cruise, Taylor maneuvered the tour boat into an 
isolated inlet and he and his passengers watched, enthralled, as not 30 feet 
away a doe and two fawns nibbled at the lakeside brush. It was an idyllic 
scene, pretty as a post card . . . until a mountain lion, with the big cat's 
legendary quickness, burst out of the bushes and killed the doe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to read about survival of the fittest in a textbook; it's 
another thing to see it acted out before your eyes," Taylor comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it was a little like watching the murder of Bambi," admits 
Taylor, "but that's nature's way and it's not my job to interrupt it." 
</P>
<P>

It may be that last Saturday's Fete X Five ("Feast Times Five") gala for the 
March of Dimes will be remembered as the first local fund-raiser to touch off 
an international furor. If so, blame it on event chairwoman Luba Johnston, who 
just put her lips together and whistled, and lured five of the world's most 
talented chefs away from their own restaurants and into the kitchens at the 
Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The Champagne Ballroom was, for that one night, not only San Diego's top 
restaurant but one of the best in the world, featuring the culinary efforts of 
a team that included Paris restaurateur/chef Michel Pasquet; Michel Richard of 
Citrus in Los Angeles, and the New York trio of Daniel Boulud of Le Cirque, 
Michel Fitoussi of Regine's and Jean Jacques Rachou of La Cote Basque. 
</P>
<P>
Any one of them would have been a strong draw; the five together guaranteed 
that the party sold out its 550 seats by mid-December. Proceeds are expected to 
handily exceed the $130,000 raised by the 1987 event. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who has directed a number of major galas and reprised her role as 
Fete X Five chair, said that putting together the evening was worthwhile, if 
not exactly a slice of angel's food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Act to Follow 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's tough to follow your own act," she said. "It was a challenge 
for me. But I'm so happy I did it twice, because the evening is fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
It was Johnston's Gallic Gang of Five who made the gala fantastic, and they 
were enticed away from the home fires by noted New York Times food writer and 
former master chef Pierre Franey, who said it was the first time the group had 
worked together. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all friends of mine, and they all agreed to come the moment I asked 
them," Franey said. "It's the best group I could have assembled -- what they're 
doing is not easy, but they care. They do care." 
</P>
<P>
The guests cared, too, especially for the quintet of unusual appetizers that 
circulated during the cocktail hour. Those in search of hors d'oeuvres 
perfected a kind of dive 'n' dip routine that was a cross between the Icky 
Woods Shuffle and the Hustle. If one wanted to grab one of Richard's quail 
egg-caviar canapes or a triangle of Rachou's country pate, it was necessary to 
dart athletically through the crowds that thronged the reception-hour buffets. 
The scene was peaceful only in the vicinity of Fitoussi's "Italian cigars," 
roulades of prosciutto, avocado and mozzarella that many guests described as 
dull. 
</P>
<P>
While the scene at the cocktail reception 
</P>
<P>
bordered on the frenetic, the atmosphere in the kitchen was almost 
preternaturally calm. The chefs, their sous chefs (each had brought at least 
one assistant) and the hotel staff did their best to give the impression that 
the evening was nothing more than business as usual, although none except the 
hotel's banquet chefs have the habit of preparing 550 dinners at once. 
</P>
<P>
Sheraton Executive Chef Bob Brody, who coordinated the effort, said he wasn't 
even faintly intimidated by the presence of so much talent in his kitchen, 
although his tone seemed to indicate a different point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great, it's just excellent," Brody said of the evening's fare. "There's a 
depth of flavor that doesn't exist with the nouvelle cuisine stuff. You're not 
dealing with kids here." 
</P>
<P>
That perception was shared by members of the event committee who were detailed 
to greet the chefs at the airport. Gala co-chair Dixie Unruh was amazed by 
Boulud's baggage, which included a crate filled with the frozen veal stock he 
had confected in his New York kitchen. "He even brought his own bacon, and we 
have bacon here, for goodness' sake," she said. "These chefs are so particular 
about everything!" 
</P>
<P>
That particularity showed up during dinner, which began promisingly with 
Richard's eggplant terrine, grew brilliant with Boulud's roasted swordfish in 
Sherry vinegar sauce, survived Rachou's old-fashioned stuffed veal loin and 
continued with Pasquet's heady goat cheese salad. The finish was devasting to 
anyone who thought he already had seen the best that pastry chefs have to 
offer; it consisted of sugar "apples," each blown like glass from a 
green-tinted sugar cube and filled with a lime mousse. It made believers out of 
those who previously had scoffed at the fussiness of French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Since the evening revolved around food, one focus was the auction of dinners to 
be prepared at some of the city's grander homes. Restaurateurs George Munger 
and Bertrand Hug wielded the gavel under which meals were sold at, among 
others, Kathy and George Pardee's (the builder himself will serve as chef) and 
Virginia and Jack Monday's, where Jorg Dosseger will wield the saute pans. In 
all, the auction added about $11,000 to the gala's net proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonas Salk, whose Salk Institute was built with March of Dimes funds, 
headed up the guest list with his wife, artist Francoise Gilot. Among others 
were Cecil Green, San Diego Padres acting president and March of Dimes chapter 
chairman Dick Freeman; Tawfiq and Richel Khoury; vintners John and Martha 
Culbertson; Charles and Sue Edwards; Audrey Geisel; Charles and Rene Taubman; 
George and Martha Gafford; Donald and Lois Roon; Frank and Joanne Warren; Sheri 
and Ben Kelts; Bill and Jeanne Larson; Jacque Powell; Neal and Linda Hooberman, 
and Bill and Alma Spicer.

The number of building permits for multi-family housing issued during the first 
11 months of 1988 sagged 26% contrasted with the same period of 1987. Although 
most of the drop took place in the county's unincorporated areas, Santa Ana, 
Laguna Beach and Irvine also recorded large decreases. Here's how the various 
cities compare, with the list rendered from largest decreases to largest 
increases:

El Dorado High School, playing without two important reserve players and with 
two starters hampered by injury, defeated Cypress, 56-45, in an Empire League 
boys' basketball game Friday at El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest point total for the Hawks this season (they average 74 
points). But it was enough to keep El Dorado undefeated in league play and a 
game ahead of Cypress. El Dorado is 15-4 overall, 5-0 in the league. Cypress is 
9-10, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress came back from a 17-point first-half deficit to get to within three 
with 1:56 remaining in the game. But the rally fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing reserves Shaun Facione (right knee) and Tim Murray (sprained 
ankle and fractured left wrist) this week for an indefinite period, and with 
starters Matt Luke and Mike Renaud hampered with minor injuries, the Hawks took 
control early. 
</P>
<P>
They had surged to a 6-0 lead on baskets by Luke, Renaud and Jerome Facione 
before Cypress scored with 4:35 remaining in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to playing 9-10 guys a game," El Dorado Coach Wayne Carlson said. 
Losing coach Shaun Facione and Murray "takes away a little bit of our options." 
</P>
<P>
But Jerome Facione powered the El Dorado offense in the first quarter with 8 of 
the team's 16 points. He finished with 12. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, the Hawks built a 17-point lead, largely behind Luke. He 
scored 6 of his 14 points in the quarter. He also finished with 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, Luke killed us on the boards," said Cypress Coach Kevin 
Loftus. "And they did exactly what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half we geared up our defense and took away their break." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress closed a 15-point halftime gap to trail by only by nine going into the 
final period. But El Dorado got a free throw by Facione with 1:47 remaining and 
two baskets from Luke with under a minute to go for the 11-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 73, Katella 54 -- Los Alamitos outscored Katella, 27-10, in the 
third quarter, with forward Geoff Graham scoring 9 of his 11 points in the 
quarter. The big quarter came after Katella (6-11, 2-3) had cut Los Alamitos' 
10-point first-quarter lead to 4 (27-23) by halftime. Mike Wilson scored 14, 
Graham and Brent Overbeek each had 11 for Los Alamitos (8-12, 3-2). Brian 
Yourstone led Katella with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Loara 59, Esperanza 51 -- Tes Whitlock scored 21 points and had 7 assists to 
lead host Loara (3-13, 1-4). Joe Gaudio added 14 points and 8 rebounds, and 
Brad Leonard had 10 points and 7 rebounds for Loara, which took control by 
outscoring Esperanza, 14-5, in the second quarter to lead, 30-20, at the half. 
Esperanza is 6-13, 0-5.

Servite High School started something it couldn't finish against Mater Dei 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars kept close to Mater Dei, the second-ranked team in Orange County, 
through the first quarter and into the second. 
</P>
<P>
But Mater Dei took control late in the first half, and then Dylan Rigdon scored 
17 third-quarter points to lead the Monarchs past Servite, 79-56, in front of 
1,500 at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (20-2, 4-0) remained in first place in the Angelus League. Servite 
dropped to 11-7, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any letdowns," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. "We 
struggled a bit early but then we got things going." 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon, a 6-foot 4-inch senior guard, had 31 points to lead all scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morris, who had 15 points, opened the game for Mater Dei with a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Johnson, who led the Friars with 15 points, answered with a 15-footer, 
prompting the Servite fans to litter the court with streams of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
A technical foul was called on Servite. Rigdon made both shots and Mater Dei 
was on its way to an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Servite rallied to get within 2 points twice, late in the first quarter and 
early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Mater Dei took control of the boards in the second quarter and went on a 
late run, including a free throw by Rigdon and stolen pass and basket by Dan 
O'Neil at the buzzer, for a 37-22 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon then started his assault with about 6 minutes left, hitting a 10-foot 
jump shot. He ended the quarter scoring 5 points within the closing seconds.

VICTORY LEAVES TRABUCO HILLS ALONE IN FIRST PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There was some question whether Laguna Hills High School lost its poise, fell 
victim to frustration or flat out quit Friday night in its Pacific Coast League 
showdown against Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little question which is the best team in the league after 
Trabuco Hills overcame a 11-point deficit to score a convincing 66-48 victory 
in front of a capacity crowd at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (12-5, 4-0) claimed sole possession of first place with the 
victory, after trailing, 30-19, with only 1:31 remaining in the first half. The 
Mustangs trimmed the deficit to 30-26 before halftime and then pounded Laguna 
Hills in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (11-7, 3-1) managed to score only 7 points in the next 15 minutes 
and couldn't get out of the gymnasium fast enough once the game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much what happened in the second half, it was the final minute 
and a half of the first half that turned the game around," said Joe Reid, 
Laguna Hills coach. "We gave up 8 straight points and the guys came into the 
locker room at halftime mad and ticked off. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't play this game effectively when you're mad. Maybe football, but not 
basketball. Once they got the lead, that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Randy Kriech tied the score, 30-30, with 6:45 remaining in the third 
quarter and then the Mustangs poured it on. Center Rick Swanwick scored 17 of 
his game-high 30 points in the second half, including a 3-point play with 4:30 
remaining in the third quarter to push Trabuco Hills ahead, 54-36. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick made 13 of 22 shots, had 21 rebounds and blocked 3 shots, but it was a 
play by teammate Tim Manning late in the first half that turned the game 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Manning grabbed an errant pass while falling out of bounds and somehow managed 
to flip the ball behind his back to a teammate. Trabuco Hills turned the 
turnover into a basket and the momentum took a huge swing in the Mustangs' 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the play of the game," said Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills coach. "It was 
an inspiring play that fired up the guys at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf also credited a change in defensive strategy for turning around the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a little too tricky in the first half," he said. "We tried a zone press 
and they were beating us over the middle. I decided to forget it and go back to 
our man defense. Basic fundamental defense won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sheff was the only consistent player for Laguna Hills. Sheff scored 19 
points, including several acrobatic 3-point plays. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge 66, Laguna Beach 60 -- Joe Cohen scored 22 points, 12 in the third 
quarter, to lead Woodbridge at home. Bryant McLemore added 11 points, all in 
the second quarter, for the Warriors (5-10, 3-1). Woodbridge also had a 
productive night at the line, making 21 of 28 free throws. John Trevino scored 
17 for Laguna Beach (7-10, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
Orange 78, Costa Mesa 77 -- Carlos Duran made 2 free throws with 8 seconds left 
for host Orange (3-11, 1-3). Duran scored 11 points. Rick Afalava scored 22 
points and John Rodriquez 18 for the Panthers. Young Chang scored 26 points and 
Tuan Vu 25 for Costa Mesa (1-13, 0-4).

SADDLEBACK STARTS FAST, HOLDS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Such are the sweet times, hoop-wise, at Saddleback High School these days that 
the big concern is that the team might be too good for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Saddleback beat Sea View League rival Tustin, 61-48, in front of 1,200 
at home. The Roadrunners got out to a big lead by playing a near flawless first 
quarter, then nearly blew that lead and then had the fortitude and talent to 
build the lead again. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn how to play with a big lead," said Pat Quinn, Saddleback's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you're going to have a problem, that's a problem to have. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is 18-1, 3-1 in league, and ranked No. 1 in Orange County. But it 
has had a history of blowing big leads this season, most recently last week's 
game against Estancia in which Saddleback led by 18 but had to hold on for a 
3-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Saddleback had a 21-3 lead after the first quarter. His team rich in 
quickness and athleticism, Quinn is able to use an aggressive, overplaying 
defense that produces turnovers and in turn, points. 
</P>
<P>
"We depend on our defense to feed our offense," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback forced 7 turnovers in the first quarter, 5 of those were steals and 
4 led directly to baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback made 7 of 12 shots from the floor and outrebounded Tustin, 12-2, in 
the quarter. Tustin (11-8, 1-3) didn't get its first field goal until just 50 
seconds remained in the quarter, and was having such a hard time bringing the 
ball up court that it attempted just 4 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But, by halftime, Tustin had cut the lead to 29-23, outscoring Saddleback, 
20-8, in the second quarter, and outrebounding Saddleback, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's lead was cut to 4 points, 36-32, with 3:30 left in the third 
quarter when Jason Moore converted a layup. 
</P>
<P>
But then came 3 Saddleback steals and 4 consecutive baskets that gave it a 
44-32 lead by the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-7 run by Saddleback in the first 4 minutes of the fourth quarter built the 
lead to 59-39 after which the game went into a sort of cruise control. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Saddleback had 14 steals and forced Tustin into 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Simon had 18 points for Saddleback, Crain Marshall had 17 and Malru Dottin 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Dylan Steiler scored a game-high 23 points, picking up the slack for 
guard Cheavly Ly (19 points a game), who was benched in the first half for 
disciplinary reasons. Ly played in the second half, scoring 7 points. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 65, Corona del Mar 52 -- Mike Curtis scored 26 points to lead host 
Estancia (16-2, 3-1). The Eagles led, 16-11, at the end of the first quarter 
and 31-20 at halftime. Augustin Heredia scored 18 points for Estancia. Matt 
Herrington and Matt Cwiertnia each scored 13 points for Corona del Mar (11-6, 
2-2). 
</P>
<P>
University 63, Newport Harbor 57 (OT) -- Dave Dieter made 6 of 7 free throws in 
overtime for University (7-11, 2-2) at Newport Harbor. In the fourth quarter, 
University led, 53-50, but Craig DeBusk made a 3-point field goal with 1 second 
left to send the game into overtime. Dieter scored 19 points and Stephan Mumaw 
16 for University. Chris Lee scored 20 points and Paig Parish 17 for Newport 
Harbor (11-8, 0-4).

Southern California College recorded its second-largest margin of victory in 
school history with a 120-75 victory over host Christ College of Irvine Friday 
night in a Golden State Athletic Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards' 45-point margin was 5 points fewer than in their 132-67 victory 
Jan. 7. That also was against Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
SCC jumped to a 10-point lead in the first 6 minutes, increased it to 27 points 
at the half and pulled away from there. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to do some things different," Christ College Irvine Coach David Wild 
said. "We didn't stop, we played them, but they're good." 
</P>
<P>
SCC (15-2 overall, 4-0 in conference play) put in its reserves 10 minutes into 
the game, but that didn't seem to make much difference. SCC's Kyle Lundy led 
all scorers with 26 points and 6 assists in about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to pull back and work on some man-on-man (defense) and some offensive 
things we're having trouble with," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "They wouldn't 
do it, they just kept the pressure on. That's our style. 
</P>
<P>
SCC's Terry Scruggs scored 24 points, pulled down 10 rebounds and made 4 
steals. Albert Gay led Christ College Irvine with 19 points. SCC outrebounded 
Christ College Irvine, 36-18.

THE CHICAGO COMMODITIES PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSEUP: FROM PLATINUM TO PORK BELLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by MELANIE PICKETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trading pits in Chicago may seem far away from most consumers, but many of 
the farm and financial products represented there and elsewhere in the futures 
markets are part of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
When traders talk about pork bellies futures, they are speculating on the 
eventual price of bacon. When investors show interest in frozen concentrated 
orange juice futures, they are betting on whether a cold freeze this winter in 
Florida will affect the price of juice. They even speculate on the price of 
heating oil and cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
Take corn futures, for instance, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. Long 
before a farmer's corn crop is ready for harvest, he makes a contract to 
supply, say, 5,000 bushels of corn on a certain date at an agreed upon price. 
</P>
<P>
That contract to supply the corn then develops a financial life of its own. For 
months, while the corn is still growing, the contract is traded back and forth 
and its price goes up and down. The national outlook for the corn crop, 
weather, international demand, crop diseases and government subsidies all 
affect the supply and demand for corn and, thus, the price of the futures 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at some of the more popular and better-known items traded in the 
futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE YEN: The yen is the official currency of Japan. The U.S. trade deficit 
and the strength of the Japanese economy cause the yen to rise and fall against 
the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Speculators buy yen futures on the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange's international money market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
T-BONDS: Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. government with maturities of 10 
years or longer to finance long-term debt. Trading in T-bonds futures 
represented about 30% of major futures trading in 1987. Traded on the Chicago 
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P 500 INDEX: The Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating firm has compiled an 
index of 500 stocks intended to represent broadly the stocks traded over the 
counter and on the New York and American stock exchanges. This index goes up 
and down based on the prices of the 500 stocks. Trading in futures contracts is 
based on expectations of how the S&amp;P 500 will perform. Traded on the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOYBEANS: Used extensively as livestock feed in the form of soybean meal. 
Soybean oil is used to make such food products as shortening, margarine, 
cooking and salad oil and other products such as paint and varnish, resins and 
plastics. Futures and options are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COCOA: Cocoa is primarily used in chocolates and candles of all kinds, as well 
as in semiprocessed products such as cocoa liquor, butter and powder. Traded on 
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLATINUM: Platinum and its associated metals, rhodium and palladium, are used 
in catalytic converters in cars. Japan is the world's largest consumer of 
platinum jewelry. Platinum and palladium futures are traded on the N.Y. 
Mercantile Exchange, and platinum futures are also traded on the Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange for Industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PORK BELLIES: The layer of meat and fat from the underside of hog from which

MILLIONS LINE UP FOR A SHOT AT $40 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

He may have been standing in a 15-minute line to buy $4 worth of lottery 
tickets on a lark Friday, but Harry Anderson denied he was buying into 
"Lottomania." He said he knows his chances of winning the $40-million jackpot 
are one in 14 million. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents and grandparents would be spinning in their graves if they knew the 
government was taking the poor people's money like this," said Anderson, a 
computer programmer from South Pasadena, while waiting his turn at the Olympic 
gift shop in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson and millions of other Lotto players up and down the state queued 
in pharmacies, liquor stores, markets, restaurants and convenience stores in 
pursuit of the third-largest payoff since the California Lottery began. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rexsteiner, owner of an Anaheim convenience store, said the Lotto rush 
started early Friday as morning commuters stopped in for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"From 6 to 8 in the morning we sold a lot more Lotto (tickets) and Quick Pick 
because of the fact that the pot is large," Rexsteiner said. "We've had no 
lines, but there's been a lot of activity all day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference in Strategies 
</P>
<P>
David Mejia, a convenience market clerk in Costa Mesa, said he has noticed a 
difference in the buying strategies of his Lotto customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had as many people as we expected, but those who have come in buy 
$20 or $30 worth of tickets, much more than they normally buy," Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Mejia and Rexsteiner say they like playing Lotto, only Rexsteiner 
had already purchased a "winning ticket." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got this one wrapped up already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Jackson, who lives on disability payments, bought two lottery tickets 
at the Palace International Cafeteria on San Francisco's Market Street, where 
the line of hopeful customers stretched out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"With this $2 I could have bought another blouse at Goodwill," she said. "But . 
. . they say once in your life you are supposed to experiences riches. I 
haven't yet." 
</P>
<P>
The stakes began to swell this week as Wednesday's $22-million jackpot went 
unclaimed, marking the third game in a row without a winner. The prize money 
was rolled over into today's game, which is expected to provide $40 million for 
the person or persons, if any, able to pick all six winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
California Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said the prize, although far less 
than October's world record of $61.98 million, would be the eighth-largest 
lottery jackpot ever awarded in the United States. Four of the top 10 jackpots 
nationwide have been won in California, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales Thursday reached $3.9 million, far more than the $1.5 average 
revenue for that day of the week, McNabb said. Lotto playing hours were 
extended for an extra hour Friday, to 11 p.m, but officials said they expected 
the longest lines to materialize at 6 p.m. today, one hour and 45 minutes 
before closing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$40 a Month 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Columbus Pharmacy in Los Angeles' Chinatown, Dave Osborn, a 
plumber from Newport Beach, said he has been shelling out $5 a week for tickets 
since the lottery's inception. He has won only once -- collecting $5. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he could have spent the money on a vacation, he mused. Yet he said he 
has no regrets. "I figure I could blow $5 on something a lot worse than a 
chance to win $40 million," he said.

Francisco contributed to this story.

BLINDNESS PUTS UP HURDLE FOR SPELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick, spell kaleidoscope. But wait, that's not fair. You just saw the word. 
</P>
<P>
Now try spelling it without looking at it. Without using a pencil and paper to 
scribble it down. Without even visualizing the letters. A little more 
difficult, right? 
</P>
<P>
That's what 11-year-old Scott Blanks had to do to win the Anaheim City School 
District spelling bee this week. Scott, who has never seen a written word 
because he was born blind, had to rely solely on his memory and his smarts to 
capture the prize. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a sixth-grader at Clara Barton Elementary School in Anaheim, correctly 
spelled kaleidoscope after the other finalist slipped up. Then he clinched the 
contest by correctly spelling psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to remember the spelling of a word after I've read it somewhere," Scott 
said. Although he could not really explain how, Scott said he sees the word in 
his head "in a sense," without knowing what the letters look like. 
</P>
<P>
A blind person learns spelling after "a lot of practice, which Scott does. He's 
a very bright boy," said John McGowan, who teaches the visually handicapped at 
Clara Barton. "It is unusual for a blind person to be a good speller." 
</P>
<P>
Even being an avid reader, which Scott is, does not necessarily help a blind 
person spell, McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Braille is not always a literal transcription, he said. Although there is a 
Braille symbol for every letter of the alphabet, when words are transcribed 
into Braille, they often are abbreviated, using Braille signs, he said. For 
example, the letter b in Braille also stands for the word but, and c also 
stands for can. 
</P>
<P>
 A word in Braille can consist of both letters and contractions, he said. For 
example, the word forgettable in Braille becomes the symbol for for, plus the 
Braille sign for the letters g-e-t-t-a, followed by the Braille sign for the 
syllable ble. 
</P>
<P>
"The spelling ability of the blind, of course, is comparable to that of anyone 
else," McGowan said. "But through Braille, it becomes more difficult." Scott, 
he said, "has to compensate with his memory." 
</P>
<P>
And while the other contestants in the spelling bee were allowed to scribble 
their words on paper to see if they looked right, Scott couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
And he did miss a few words -- mayonnaise, ukulele and incandescent, for 
example -- but the other finalist, Millicent Encarnacion of Benito Juarez 
Elementary School, missed them, too, so the competition continued. (Scott said 
he had never even heard the word incandescent before, so he had little hope of 
getting it correct.) The contest became a bit of a cliffhanger at the end, 
McGowan said, with Scott and Millicent both spelling words correctly, then both 
spelling them incorrectly, for about 10 minutes before Scott finally won. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he studied for the bee with his mother, who read difficult words for 
him to spell aloud. "If I got it wrong, she'd tell me," he said. Despite its 
difficulty, spelling is important for the blind, McGowan said. Scott, he said, 
writes his assignments on a computer specially programmed with a voice 
synthesizer. (The computer speaks out loud the letters as he types them, and 
then speaks the words and sentences he has written.) Teachers can see if he has 
misspelled a word when he turns in a printout of his work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruining a First Impression 
</P>
<P>
"It's particularly important for the visually handicapped to be able to use a 
typewriter and a computer to communicate with the sighted," McGowan said. Yet, 
a misspelled word can create the impression that the blind person is stupid or 
illiterate, he said. "It can ruin a first impression." 
</P>
<P>
Scott did not hesitate to enter the spelling bee, just as he has not been 
afraid to tackle any challenge in life, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who is in the program for gifted students at school, "is very bright. He 
amazes me. If he wasn't my own child, I'd say, 'Gosh, look at him,' " said Judy 
Blanks. 
</P>
<P>
He rides a bicycle, although other people learning to balance a two-wheeler 
rely much on sight. True, the bike has training wheels on it, but Scott's 
parents know it is time to take them off. Scott cannot ride any distance alone, 
but his parents may tie a rope from his bike to his father's bike to guide him. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also rides a scooter and can roller skate. "He doesn't have an attitude 
(of being handicapped). He's not frightened of things. He tries a lot of 
things," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he also likes more sedentary activities, such as playing video games 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorize the Sounds 
</P>
<P>
"I memorize the sounds. . . . I can't explain it," he said, describing his 
playing technique. Among his favorite games are Pole Position, a simulation of 
driving a car on a race course, and Asteroids, in which he shoots down objects 
in space. He is also a fan of horror movies, apparently because of the action 
and sounds, McGowan said. And when most people look away during the gory parts, 
"I don't have to," Scott said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
When he grows up, Scott would like to be a zoologist "because I like animals a 
lot," or a computer programmer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott lives in Los Alamitos, but the school district there sends its visually 
handicapped students to the Anaheim school. McGowan has been his teacher since 
Scott was in preschool. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott is in class with sighted children, McGowen said, his classmates can 
take notes or look up something later in books. But Scott has to remember what 
has been said or read to him. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott qualified for the Gifted and Talented Education program several 
years ago, it "had nothing to do" with his blindness. McGowan said. "In fact, 
it was despite" it. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Scott, his spelling bee days are over for a while. Although 
he won the contest as the best of the sixth-graders from Anaheim's 21 
elementary schools, he lost out in the countywide competition Thursday night, 
McGowan said.

GRANT BOYS PLANS TO QUIT SELLING SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of one of the largest gun stores in Orange County said Friday he will 
stop selling such military assault weapons as the AK-47 rifle, the type used to 
kill five grade-school pupils in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Garell, president of the Grant Boys store in Costa Mesa, said the retail 
gun dealers must "wake up and face facts." 
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is on the wall that these types of weapons with massive 
firepower have little true purpose," said Garell, who also sells camping and 
outdoor gear. "I believe they are going to be banned eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Garell, in a move that he expects will be criticized by other weapons dealers 
and owners, said he will cease selling all semiautomatic assault weapons at his 
Newport Boulevard store after his current inventory is exhausted. He added that 
he plans to contact local law enforcement agencies about purchasing the assault 
firearms he now has in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Garell said he was "greatly disturbed" by the killings Tuesday in Stockton by 
an unemployed drifter armed with a Soviet-designed AK-47 rifle and a handgun. 
He said his decision to discontinue sales was prompted by statements from Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and others calling for a statewide ban on 
several assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Those assault weapons include the Israeli Uzi and the U.S.-made AR-15, a 
semiautomatic version of the M-16 military weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Listening to Gates -- a pretty conservative, pro-gun guy -- you realize that 
these weapons don't belong in certain hands," said Garell, whose company has 
been in business 40 years. "And to say that (some) guns sold at legitimate 
stores don't find their way into the wrong hands is wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Kahn, owner of B &amp; B Sales, one of Southern California's biggest 
gun retailers, said a ban on sales of semiautomatic rifles would do nothing 
"but improve the odds for criminals." Kahn, who last year sold more than 40,000 
weapons through his North Hollywood and Westminster stores, said the problem is 
the court system, which allows "convicted criminals back on the street" too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn said the bulk of individuals buying assault weapons are military veterans 
who like to have the weapons for reasons of nostalgia, or recreational gun 
owners who like going to the desert to "shoot at cans." 
</P>
<P>
Some even buy them for personal protection, said Kahn, though he conceded a 
handgun is a better form of defense at close range because it is easier for the 
average person to aim and fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surge in Sales Expected 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday's shootings, Kahn said, the AK-47 was "losing its appeal . . . 
but now there will probably be a surge in sales again." He explained that some 
people who had not been aware that assault weapons were readily available and 
relatively inexpensive likely will be in the market for them now. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, most assault rifles, unlike handguns, can be purchased 
over the counter with no waiting period. A handgun purchase involves a 
state-mandated background check that usually takes 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
If a background check was required for assault weapons, Garell said, the 
Stockton gunman might not have been able to buy the AK-47 he used. Patrick 
Edward Purdy, a high school dropout, had a long history of arrests on a variety 
of misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who favors a complete ban on the 
sale of assault weapons, said the Legislature "at the very least" should 
require a background check before one of the high-powered rifles can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any constructive reason why anyone should own one of those," 
Bergeson said. "They are simply used to carry out warfare on private citizens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban Sought 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Stockton killings, several California lawmakers, including 
state Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), have said they 
plan to introduce legislation to ban the sale of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But Fred Romero, Southern California field representative for the National 
Rifle Assn., said talk of adopting new laws is "simply a knee-jerk reaction." 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the average citizen will lose," Romero said in a telephone 
interview from his Simi Valley home. "What you'll be doing is disarming the 
average man and woman, making them more vulnerable to the bad guys, who will 
have no problem obtaining those weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Though opposed to a strict ban on sales, Romero said his organization would 
favor creation of a central data bank to which gun dealers could have access by 
computer to check backgrounds of assault weapon buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The semiautomatic weapon used by Purdy is one of more than 80,000 AK-47s 
imported into the United States from China during the past 3 years. Purdy 
purchased his weapon, which has a magazine that can hold as many as 75 bullets, 
in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese AK-47 can be purchased for less than $300, while a fancier 
Czechoslovakian version generally sells for twice that. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that the price of the AK-47 has much to do with its 
popularity," said Charles Yoon, owner of Central Sporting Goods in downtown 
Santa Ana. Yoon said he sold about 10 of the Chinese models last year but 
added: "It's not all that popular. Most people want handguns." 
</P>
<P>

ARSON FIRE DESTROYS 1 BUSINESS, DAMAGES 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gasoline-fed arson fire destroyed a Garden Grove travel agency and damaged 
three other businesses in a strip shopping center Friday morning, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began inside Travel World, 8907 Westminster Blvd., about 3 a.m. and 
spread to three other businesses through the attic, Garden Grove Fire 
Department Capt. Bill Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gasoline was used to accelerate the fire," Dumas said. "It was poured into the 
business and set afire." Investigators do not have any suspects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took 34 firefighters about an hour to contain the fire, which caused 
$400,000 in damage to the travel agency, an escrow company, a beauty college 
and a financial planning office.

CANCER PATIENT HOME AFTER MARROW OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old cancer patient who successfully underwent an operation last month 
to help his body produce white blood cells was released Friday from St. Joseph 
Hospital in Orange, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Summersgill, diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1982, had been under 
protective isolation at the hospital since Dec. 20, when he received a bone 
marrow transplant, hospital spokesman Dennis Gashen said. 
</P>
<P>
Hematologist and oncologist Richard W. Opfell said the transplant enabled 
Summersgill's body to produce disease-fighting white blood cells without 
transfusions. Summersgill was in good spirits Friday when he left the hospital 
wearing a protective mask to prevent infection and should be under the 
supervision of visiting nurses for no more than a week, Opfell said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's now producing white blood (cells) very nicely," Opfell said. "He has a 
50-50 chance of living out a normal life span without any other problems with 
the Hodgkin's disease." Without the transplant, Summersgill's chances of 
surviving 5 years would have been 10% or less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Summersgill was resting at home Friday and was unavailable for comment. His 
wife, Tammy, said she is optimistic about her husband's recovery and happy to 
have him home. So are their children, 9 and 4, who eagerly awaited his return, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so glad to have daddy back. They couldn't sleep last night."

Suspected Molester Closely Guarded in Court 
</P>
<P>
Suspected child molester James A. Hydrick appeared for arraignment in West 
Orange County Municipal Court on Friday with five deputy marshals closely 
guarding him. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick, an expert in karate who faces 13 counts of child molestation, was 
denied a restraining order for what his attorney called "verbal abuse by 
deputies" in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Michael Beecher also postponed Hydrick's arraignment until Feb. 
6 at the request of public defender Pamela Boyd. The request was "a defense 
tactic," Boyd said later. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said she sought the restraining order because sheriff's deputies at County 
Jail verbally abused Hydrick. Beecher told her that specific complaints should 
be directed to jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrick, 29, sat in a booth enclosed by a metal screen as two deputy marshals 
stood behind him. Three other marshals stood by the front entrance to the 
courtroom. The extra security precautions were taken because Hydrick is 
considered an escape risk, Lt. Les Weaver of the marshal's office said. Hydrick 
reportedly has escaped from at least three jails.

Hydrick was returned to Orange County earlier this month from a Georgia jail to 
face the molestation charges. Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski said the charges 
involve a small group of Huntington Beach boys that Hydrick allegedly 
befriended while living there last year.

GRANDAD SAYS BONE PIECES AREN'T LAURA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The grandfather of Laura Bradbury, who disappeared more than 4 years ago from a 
family campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, angrily repudiated a 
televised report Friday that said skull fragments found in the Morongo Basin in 
1986 were those of his granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Baloney!" Dana Winters said. "Don't you think if they had found that the 
skeletal remains had matched up that they would have notified the parents? 
Don't you think that's the logical thing?" 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-TV reported Friday evening that recent DNA testing at an unnamed "eastern 
laboratory" on the skull fragments indicated a "99% probability of a match" 
with the Huntington Beach child, who was 3 years old when she disappeared on 
Oct. 18, 1984. The station did not cite its sources for the report. 
</P>
<P>
Winters said his son-in-law and daughter, Mike and Patty Bradbury, were 
recently asked by the news media to comment on those tests. The couple were out 
of town Friday and not available for comment, but Winters said they both 
discredited the DNA test results. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Cited 
</P>
<P>
The missing girl's grandfather said that the Bradburys had cooperated with 
investigators for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department more than 2 
years ago, when the bone fragments were first discovered. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, a forensic anthropologist at Cal State Fullerton was unable to 
determine whether they were Laura's. In fact, anthropologist Judy Suchey found 
that the fragments were from a child between the ages of 2 and 5 who had been 
dead for less than 2 years, but she was unable to determine either the sex of 
the child or its ethnic origin. 
</P>
<P>
"And Patty and Mike also couldn't believe the skull was ever Laura's because 
the location where it was found was in an unaccessible area and impossible for 
a child to get into," Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
"But isn't it interesting how whoever is quoting this latest test never reveals 
the source? And if it's a testing laboratory, well, tell me which one. Doesn't 
it seem odd to you? Like as if someone is trying to get publicity?" 
</P>
<P>
Since Suchey's examination, the Bradburys have not been contacted by any 
scientific laboratory, Winters said, indicating that any blood tests that would 
be needed for DNA analysis had to have been taken 2 years ago. At that time, 
several San Bernardino sheriff's spokesmen, including Sheriff Floyd Tidwell, 
discounted the tests, saying that "not enough positive evidence" was found to 
say conclusively that the skull was Laura's. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we could tell was that it was a skull of a human child," Phil 
Alexander, chief deputy coroner of San Bernardino County, told The Times 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Winters said that Mike Bradbury hasn't stopped looking for his daughter, 
despite reports that he and Patty Bradbury have given up hope and planned to 
get on with their lives. The couple do not believe that the fragments are 
Laura's, and Mike Bradbury has expressed anger at authorities for how the 
investigation was handled, Winters added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Truth to Report' 
</P>
<P>
"As far as Mike and Patty are concerned, there is no truth to this report and 
no truth that they have given up," Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-TV reporter Dave Lopez said that the fragments analyzed under the DNA 
process were studied at the request of the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. 
That department, however, has refused to confirm or deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Bradbury, who has waged a dispute for several years with the San 
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, has suggested she will not believe any 
study that involves that agency. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS-TV said a final report on the DNA analysis is due within the next 60 days.

HE'S A 13-TIME LOSER FOR DRUNK DRIVING -- NOW PRISON LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Buena Park man who has been convicted of drunk driving more than a dozen 
times has been charged with the same offense again and could be sentenced to 3 
years in prison under a new state law, even though he has never injured anyone 
in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sean O'Brien, 39, has been charged with felony drunk driving under a 
law that calls for more serious punishment for repeat drunk drivers. In the 
past, drunk driving has been treated as a felony only if someone was injured or 
killed in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, a person with three drunk driving convictions within 7 years 
may be charged with a felony if he is arrested again on the same charge, said 
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Margaret A. Powers. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said O'Brien has been convicted of driving under the influence of 
alcohol 13 times since 1974. Two other drunk driving charges against O'Brien 
were reduced to reckless driving, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that law was meant for anybody, it was meant for him," Powers said. She 
said it was "a miracle" that O'Brien had not injured or killed someone. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento, O'Brien has not 
had a valid driver's license since 1977. A DMV spokeswoman said O'Brien cannot 
even apply for a new license until April 17 because of past drunk driving 
convictions. If he does apply, he must meet with a referee who will decide 
whether to reinstate his license. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was arrested Tuesday by Buena Park police after he allegedly drove 
through a red light. His blood alcohol test registered 0.24, well above the 
legal limit of 0.10, police said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was first charged with misdemeanor drunk driving, but Powers decided on 
Wednesday to file the case as a felony when she learned of his history of 
convictions. O'Brien also has a drunk driving case pending in West Orange 
County Municipal Court in Westminster as a result of a 1988 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
A judge appointed the public defender's office to represent O'Brien. Deputy 
Public Defender Donald Ronaldson said he could not comment on the case because 
his staff has not had time to review it. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said O'Brien has served only two sentences in Orange County Jail after 
drunk driving convictions. He served a year beginning in April, 1985, after 
pleading guilty, and another 18 months beginning in January, 1986, in a second 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, taking his license away didn't deter him," she said. "The only 
thing we can do is keep him in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Cater, president of the Orange County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, applauded the law permitting the stiffer charge against O'Brien, 
calling it "an important new tool for law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done to get these people who are lethal weapons driving up 
and down the street," Cater said. "Hopefully, this will." 
</P>
<P>
Cater said 10 to 15 other states have laws similar to California's new statute. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we should consider confiscating their vehicles like we do with drug 
dealers," Cater said. "Maybe that way they won't be able to drive." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien is being held in Orange County Jail and is scheduled to be arraigned 
Thursday.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: THEY'VE EARNED A SHOT AT NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You think Dick Coury isn't losing a few thousand winks of sleep this week? You 
think Fritz Shurmur hasn't entered the Insomniac Hall of Fame yet? Tossing and 
turning has become their favorite pastime these recent nights. Pillow punching 
finishes a close second, with milk and cookies a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
The cause for all this sleeplessness is some boyish ambition, some unexpected 
off-season excitement. It seems the two Ram assistants find themselves among 
the finalists for a pair of National Football League head coaching jobs -- 
Coury for the Kansas City Chiefs vacancy and Shurmur for the Cleveland Browns 
opening. Both positions are plums. And both men want a job offer very much. 
</P>
<P>
Coury is 57. Shurmur is 56. They have been football coaches for almost their 
entire adult lives. They have stared at miles of game film, had more chalk 
talks than most elementary school teachers. Football is what they love. It is 
what they know, what they are. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, they were Young Turks. Coury was at USC, Shurmur at Wyoming. 
The NFL would soon be theirs for the taking. They'd spend a few seasons 
learning this and that as assistants and then some smart general manager would 
be knocking on their door with a head coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
Well, 20 years have passed and there hasn't been a single rap on wood. There 
have been inquiries, sure, but no NFL offers. 
</P>
<P>
Coury's name surfaced once for the Houston Oilers job a few years back and 
Shurmur's resume has been passed around on occasion. But that about does it. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Coury and Shurmur didn't try for jobs; they did. But there was always 
a certain circumstance or a pecking order or a mandate from an owner that 
foiled them. Shurmur said enough was enough and became a career assistant. 
Coury, still smitten, took chances. 
</P>
<P>
So intrigued was Coury with a head coaching spot that he happily accepted a 
place in the World Football League and the Portland Storm in 1974. The league 
folded and Coury returned to the NFL for 7 more seasons as an assistant before 
he got the urge again. This time, he took a head coaching job with the Boston 
Breakers of the United States Football League, where he won coach of the year 
honors in 1983 and United Van Lines client of year as the Breakers moved from 
Boston to New Orleans to Portland before Coury jumped ship and ended up with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Now he tries for one of those elusive jobs in the NFL, of which there are only 
28. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I'm so close in this one," Coury said in a telephone interview 
from Mobile, Ala., where the Ram coaching staff has assembled, in part, to 
prepare the South team for today's Senior Bowl. "It's what you work for, and 
there's not very many of them. I'm excited. I'd just like to find out (the 
decision)." 
</P>
<P>
Coury thinks he'll get a fair shot, though a Kansas City television station 
reported Friday that former Browns' Coach Marty Schottenheimer, will be named 
the Chiefs' head man on Tuesday. For starters, Coury and new Chief President 
Carl Petersen go way back, which helps. Coury also has those nearly two decades 
of professional coaching experience. And he has another theory, which revolves 
around this idea of, older is better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what has really helped it is a guy like Jerry Burns (who will be 62 
Tuesday)," Coury said. "He took over the Vikings job and turned that franchise 
around. Then Marv Levy (60) takes Buffalo to the playoffs. I don't know if 
there's any substitute for having coaching experience. I think teams have gone 
back to thinking experience is hard to come by." 
</P>
<P>
In his formal interview, the Chiefs asked Coury all sorts of questions. They 
asked him to pretend he had just been hired. It's Jan. 21: take us through the 
year. What's your plan? What will you do? Who will you hire as assistants? Why? 
What do you want to accomplish defensively and offensively? What's your 
off-season program? Yak, yak, yak. 
</P>
<P>
You think Coury wasn't prepared? He's been waiting years to hear those 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur is another story. He had all but given up on a head coaching offer. He 
wanted one, of course, but not enough to reach for the phone every time a 
position became available. He had become selective and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have the best assistant's job in the National Football League," he 
said. "If I had the opportunity to make the choice (between a head coaching 
offer and returning to the Rams), it would not be an easy one." 
</P>
<P>
That's right, too. It might take Shurmur maybe, say, 5 or 10 seconds to tell 
the Browns yes, and the Rams adios. 
</P>
<P>
A strange thing happened to Shurmur shortly after the job opened in Cleveland. 
He found himself wondering what it would be like to run a team. He found 
himself wanting to run a team. And then he did something he hasn't done in a 
long time. He picked up the phone and called Art Modell, owner of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"But the job was open for a week or 10 days before I actually got involved," 
Shurmur said. "I really don't want to be the kind of guy who applies for every 
job." 
</P>
<P>
But now that he has, he wouldn't mind a job offer. Neither would Coury, who has 
spent time with Shurmur discussing this unique situation of two Ram assistants 
up for two head coaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually sleep well all the time," Shurmur said. "But lately I roll around 
thinking about it a little bit. It's on your mind, you bet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coury: "You dream about getting an opportunity as a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Then here's to sweet dreams and two old assistants who deserve one legitimate 
crack at the big time.

BARNES MAKES THE RIGHT MOVE AT THE RIGHT TIME; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA VALLEY RUNNER'S DECISION PAYS OFF IN RELAY VICTORY AT SUNKIST MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Kenny Barnes of Santa Ana Valley High School saw the slightest of openings, so 
he took it and passed a pack of runners on the inside of the track. He had to, 
there wasn't time to waste waiting for a bigger, or safer, opening. 
</P>
<P>
And never mind that his move into the lead violated every rule of track 
etiquette. There's nothing illegal about it, it's just considered bad form. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnes could be excused for his overeager move. He was running the fourth 
leg of the boys' rated 8 x 160-yard relay for in the Sunkist Invitational 
Friday in the Sports Arena. The race requires each runner to complete just one 
circuit of the track before handing off to a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
It's such a short race, one contested only indoors, that there isn't a moment 
to waste. And Barnes knew it, so as soon as he saw his chance, he blew by a 
runner from Eisenhower and into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
When he handed off to the next runner, Eddie Jones, the Falcons were on their 
way to victory in 2 minutes 20.1 seconds. Leuzinger was second in 2:20.4 and 
Eisenhower was third in 2:20.9. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley provided one of the highlights for Orange County athletes in 
the high school portion of the Sunkist Meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the Eisenhower runner) was in my way," Barnes said. "I had to do what I 
had to do. I was anxious to take the lead." 
</P>
<P>
The only remaining question after Barnes made his move was whether Leuzinger 
would be able to catch the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
But Brennan Lowe, Santa Ana Valley's anchor runner, held on to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we had it," Barnes said. "I just had a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's Eddie Lavelle found smoother sailing in his boys' seeded mile 
race, but the race proved to be a bittersweet experience, nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
He finished second behind Andy Samuelson of Rampart High in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. Lavelle ran 4:23.2 to Samuelson's 4:23.1. 
</P>
<P>
Lavelle took the lead after 4 laps of the 160-yard track and moved swiftly 
ahead. Only Samuleson and Jimmy Rodriguez of Santa Ana Valley stayed close, and 
they trailed by 10 and 20 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But with a little less than 80 yards to go, Samuelson pulled abreast of Lavelle 
and powered ahead to win. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was third in 4:25.8. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to run around 4:20," Lavelle said. "I just have to be happy with 
how I did and congratulate the guy from Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist Notes 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley's winning boys' 8 x 160-yard relay team was made up of: Ivan 
Dang, William Dancy, Daniel Kemp, Kenny Barnes, Eddie Jones, Justin Mills, Hung 
Chau and Brennan Lowe. Dancy also was second in the long jump with a leap of 22 
feet 8 inches. ... The Capistrano Valley boys' 2-mile relay team of Neil 
Stevenson, Brian Tucker, Bill Gould and Sean Douglas won race two in 8:25.3, 
beating Eisenhower (second in 8:27.9) and Camarillo (third in 8:30.4. . . . 
Corona del Mar's Greg Shryock won the boys' rated mile in 4:29.1. Shryock 
waited until there were 3 laps to go before moving into the lead, then held off 
Jamie Lugo of Valencia. Lugo ran 4:29.2 for second. . . . Kaci Keefer of 
Woodbridge came from behind on the last lap to win race two of the girls' 500 
in 1:11.9. . . . Laurinda Mulhaupt of Capistrano Valley, fourth a year ago, won 
race two of the girls' 880 in 2:26.9. Allison Franke of Canyon, favored to win 
the girls' long and triple jumps, did not compete because of a pulled leg 
muscle. In her place, Canyon sophomore Claire Whetlan jumped 15-7 1/4 for 
second.

RODRIGUEZ REINSTATED, LEADS FULLERTON GYMNASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton gymnast Eli Rodriguez was ruled eligible Friday, just 
before the Titans' season opener against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
With Rodriguez, the Titans pulled off a come-from-behind, 261-258.20 victory at 
Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was suspended after his involvement in the stabbing of a former 
teammate in September. He was allowed to return to practice in November but 
whether he would be allowed to compete was unknown until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans trailed entering the final event, the high bar. Rodriguez (9.60), 
Diego Lopez (8.80) and Sven Lode (8.75) swept the event to give Fullerton the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez also finished first in the rings (9.40) and won the all-round 
competition (55.55). 
</P>
<P>
In the women's competition, Fullerton's Stacey Harris won 2 of 4 events to lead 
the Titans to a 186.20-180.20 victory over Stanford.

GARDEN GROVE ARTS PANEL TO SUGGEST 'GLORY' TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Garden Grove panel studying the arts will soon recommend a number of 
fund-raising proposals, including the possibility of taxing the Crystal 
Cathedral's annual "Glory of Christmas" and "Glory of Easter" extravaganzas to 
support smaller presentations, a panel member said. 
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations prepared by the 15-member Blue Ribbon Committee on the 
Arts, appointed by the Garden Grove City Council last summer, include: 
</P>
<P>
* Asking voters to increase the tax on hotel and motel rooms by 1.5%, which 
would raise about $200,000 annually for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
* Negotiating a joint-use agreement with the Garden Grove Unified School 
District for the 1,500-seat Don Wash Auditorium. The agreement would call for 
the city to spend $225,000 for air conditioning and a face lift and would 
permit use of the facility by various performing arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishing a body to disburse arts funds appropriated by the City Council, 
thus "depoliticizing" the process. 
</P>
<P>
* Exploring the possibility of funding a 500-seat theater in Village Green 
Park, in addition to the 550-seat Festival Amphitheatre and the restored, 
172-seat Gem Theater. 
</P>
<P>
* Changing the city's motto to "city of arts and festivals" from "city of youth 
and ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the Crystal Cathedral's "Glorys" is named in the report, the 
commission member said, but it suggests studying the possibility of a tax on 
live entertainment in venues of more than 500 seats put on by profit-making 
organizations. The only performances that fit that category, and the ones 
members had in mind, the committee member said, are the "Glorys." 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for Glory Productions said the pageants are considered 
nonprofit, religious programs that provide funds to operate the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The two pageants, each with more than 100 volunteer performers, feature angels 
suspended from the ceiling of the 3,000-seat cathedral and live animals. Every 
year, they attract visitors from around the country for the month preceding 
each holiday. More than 120,000 tickets were sold, at $14 to $25, for the 1988 
version of "The Glory of Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendations are expected to be presented to the City 
Council in early February. Twice in the past 12 months, municipal funding for 
the Grove Theatre Company and the Garden Grove Symphony became a source of 
controversy when several council members opposed subsidies for the two groups.

SLONIMSKY REGALES WITH TUNES, TALES; 
</P>
<P>
MULTITALENTED MUSICOLOGIST, 94, EMPHASIZES HIS PLAYFUL SIDE AT UC IRVINE 
APPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Nicolas Slonimsky, a singular figure in 20th-Century music, regaled a UC Irvine 
audience Thursday night with his piano playing, his singing and tales from his 
remarkable career. 
</P>
<P>
The 94-year-old musicologist, who was born in Czarist Russia to a family of 
intellectuals and came to the United States in 1923, has distinguished himself 
as a pianist, composer, author and conductor who in the '30s became an early 
advocate of Charles Ives, Edgar Varese and Henry Cowell. Of that, he pronounced 
himself "very proud." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years he has worked primarily as a lexicographer, compiling such 
music reference works as the seventh edition of Baker's Biographical Dictionary 
of Musicians. He published his autobiography, "Perfect Pitch," in 1988. 
Slonimsky wanted to call it "Failed Wunderkind: A Rueful Autopsy," but the 
title was nixed by his publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a black suit, bright-red sweater, white shirt and pink, 
salmon-shaped tie, Slonimsky emphasized his playful side in his musical 
selections Thursday. He performed two of the first songs he composed in the 
United States, "The Pepsodent Song" and "The Castoria Song" -- dramatic 
Russian-flavored numbers with lyrics taken directly from '20s magazine ads. 
"Mothers, relieve your constipated child" is a line from "The Castoria Song." 
</P>
<P>
Slonimsky also used the piano to illustrate some of his work in devising new 
musical scales, work that continues to be influential in jazz and other 
circles. "I decided to reconstruct all scales, a sort of perestroika," he 
explained. Also, he said, "I wanted to annoy people" -- especially his 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive rocker Frank Zappa, familiar with Slonimsky's work with scales, 
called him in 1981, and several days later, Slonimsky found himself performing 
one of his own compositions at a Zappa concert at the Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium. It's a tale the iconoclastic Russian delighted in telling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unnatural friendship, but it is a friendship," Slonimsky said. Zappa's 
daughter Moon Unit, who with her dad scored a novelty hit called "Valley Girl" 
several years ago, even taught Slonimsky the basics of Valley talk. "I spoke 
five or six languages before I met her," Slonimsky said in his vestigial 
Russian accent, proceeding to reel off several favorite Valley phrases, 
including "totally awesome." He also announced that he had named one of his 
beloved cats Grody to the Max. 
</P>
<P>
Irreverent to the end, Slonimsky ended his performance by playing a snippet of 
the overture to Wagner's "Tannhauser" on the piano -- with a hairbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Some anxious moments followed the appearance: Paramedics had to be summoned 
when Slonimsky suddenly became ill. Posing for photographs about 30 minutes 
after his presentation in the university's Fine Arts Gallery, he slumped in his 
chair, grew pale and appeared short of breath. 
</P>
<P>
He was moved quickly to a bench, where he lay quietly until the paramedics 
arrived. His vital signs were pronounced normal, and he had recovered enough to 
get worried onlookers laughing with his one-liners. (Paramedic: "Have you had 
the flu recently?" Slonimsky: "Yes, I did have a terrible flu -- in 1918."). 
</P>
<P>
Slonimsky agreed to be taken to nearby Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian for 
further examination but later changed his mind and was driven to his home in 
Los Angeles. Reached at his home Friday, Slonimsky said he was feeling fine. 
"It turned out to be a gas attack -- a poison gas attack," he quipped.

POSTNUCLEAR GETS OK TO SELL BEER BUT FACES APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Club Postnuclear has cleared one government hurdle in its effort to win 
permission to sell beer. But it will have to answer further objections from 
Laguna Beach officials who question whether the new rock nightclub should be 
allowed to abandon its no-alcohol policy. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-2 vote Thursday night, the city Board of Adjustment gave club owner 
William (Max) Nee the OK to sell beer at Postnuclear, which opened in July at 
775 Laguna Canyon Road. But Councilman Dan Kenney said Friday that he will 
appeal the board's decision -- which means, under city law, that the City 
Council will have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
"When Postnuclear was originally approved, the council was given assurances 
that alcoholic beverages would not be served ever," Kenney said. "I have strong 
reservations about a place that allows 18-year-olds inside and is serving 
alcohol. If he wants to serve alcohol, (admission) should be 21 and over as far 
as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Board of Adjustment set new conditions for the club's 
operations, conditions Nee considers "very severe." 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that people are drinking beer outside the club and littering the 
area, the board ruled that Postnuclear's management must post a security guard 
in the club parking lot to monitor any drinking and be responsible for cleaning 
the lot every night. 
</P>
<P>
The board ordered a hearing in 6 months to determine whether Postnuclear has 
abided by those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
These restrictions, said Nee, don't "leave us any margin for error. My feeling 
is that we're (being held) responsible not only for our patrons after they 
leave the premises, but for anyone who decided they would like to drink beer in 
their car" outside the club. "My concern is that if (city officials) come down 
and see a problem, they can close my place down." 
</P>
<P>
Under the permit approved by the board, the club can operate 7 days a week from 
7 a.m. to 2 a.m., and can sell beer from 6 p.m. until closing. Only those 18 or 
older may be admitted, and patrons who want to drink beer would have to produce 
two forms of identification. (Beer-drinkers would be given a hospital-type 
wristband.) 
</P>
<P>
Board members Cynthia Love, Salvatore Maddi and Ann McDonald voted in favor of 
the permit, while board chairman Jeffrey Powers and Barbara Metzger were 
opposed. Nee said that the only public comment on his proposal at a hearing 
earlier this month had been favorable: Robert Bartlett, owner of an adjacent 
shopping center, had told the board that allowing Postnuclear to sell beer 
could curtail littering outside the club. 
</P>
<P>
Nee, who argued his own case before the Board of Adjustment, said he will 
probably hire a lawyer to represent him in the as-yet unscheduled appeal 
hearing before the City Council.
