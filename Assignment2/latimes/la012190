RICHARD EDER: THE WEIGHT OF LIGHTNESS; 
</P>
<P>
PICTURING WILL BY ANN BEATTIE (RANDOM HOUSE: $18.95; 230 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Jody married her first husband, Wayne, she had a premonition of their 
future as she looked down at his hand curved around her waist: 
</P>
<P>
"His fingers were perfectly placed but you could see how lightly their touch 
registered. Either the thing he touched was ephemeral, or his touch made it so; 
this many years later, she still wondered which. But in that instant, she had 
realized that she would slip through Wayne's fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Beattie's new novel, her first in five years, takes up once more the 
lightness and hollowness that go with the narcissism of the '70s and '80s. 
Liberation from so many outside commands -- of religion, duty, guilt, 
repression -- leaves the body, free of its chains, in a state of weightlessness 
that is quite the opposite of flying. 
</P>
<P>
In "Picturing Will," much darker than her previous work, the lightness has a 
consequence much more tangible than brittle disquiet. In a scene of pure 
horror, a victim is produced: Jody and Wayne's little boy, Will. A world freed 
of bonds falls apart, and the children fall through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, loosely retrospective, looks back 25 years or so to Jody and Wayne's 
brief marriage and the birth of Will, and samples some selected points along 
their lives since then. They begin as some sort of flower-children; they live 
briefly on a farm where she takes care of the horses and he reads, talks 
vaguely about going to college, and eventually walks out. 
</P>
<P>
Jody, with a little help from her father, moves to Charlottesville, Va., gets a 
job in a camera shop, learns photography and makes a living taking wedding 
pictures. She meets Mel, a partner in a New York art gallery; they become 
lovers, and he urges her to marry him, move to New York and concentrate on 
serious photography. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually she does. Mel gets her a show at one of New York's hottest 
galleries, partly because her work is brilliant and partly as a trade-off with 
Haverford, the gallery's ultra-trendy owner. Haverford wants Mel to work for 
him; Mel agrees. Artistic brilliance will make it in New York but you need 
angles as well. 
</P>
<P>
Jody, a devoted if nervous small-town mother, takes to the New York scene as if 
she had been made for it. She becomes a star, with Haverford's help. Will is 
all but forgotten. Mel, moving away from the world she is moving into, 
discovers his own vocation as a parent. He seizes upon it with a devotion that 
is genuine and well-meaning, but that is also as essentially narcissistic as 
Jody's stardom. 
</P>
<P>
One of the book's features is Mel's parenting diary, containing his reflections 
about children and what they need. These are thoughtful but magazine-shallow; 
there is an uneasy leadenness to them. Instead of genuine discovery, the 
reflections are a mirror into which Mel can peer, hiding his own fears and 
unhappinesses by dressing up as a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne is a narcissist of another, rougher kind. He has settled in Florida where 
he works as a gardener, sits in bars and seduces women. He is married to his 
third wife, Corky -- Jody was his second -- and is thinking of leaving her 
because she wants a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne can stand nothing that will claim him. He can't stand women's exhaustion 
when they have babies. "It was numbing, like trudging through wet sand," he 
reflects. Babies themselves frighten him with their helplessness. He cannot 
even think of himself -- fearful as he is of claims -- except in the third 
person. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, we get only brief glimpses of Will. What we see is the hollowness 
that surrounds him: a flaky mother turned star, a flaky father turned 
near-psychopath, and a kindly, unctuous, role-playing stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
The book's central episode tells of the damage. When Mel drives Will to visit 
Wayne in Florida, Haverford volunteers to come along. He brings Spencer, the 
young son of one of his former artists, ostensibly to keep Will company. 
</P>
<P>
If Jody, Wayne and even Mel are each monsters in their own way -- a way not of 
deliberate evil but of an absence of necessary good -- Haverford is the devil 
for our times. He is the ultimate evil of ultimate nonbeing. Jody, so dependent 
on him, can't even remember his name properly; she calls him Haveabud. 
</P>
<P>
Haverford-Haveabud is reptilian, powerful in his world and utterly bent upon 
his own pleasures. A figure out of a Warhol diary, he takes a particular 
pleasure in little boys. 
</P>
<P>
In a Florida motel, Will witnesses sex between the art dealer and Spencer, his 
small protege. He is tentatively, not conclusively, drawn in, but the 
witnessing is horror enough. It marks him. It is a more-than-Gothic scene, 
brilliantly laid out. It tells of a child, as terribly abandoned as a Calcutta 
orphan in the plenty and indulgences of our fashionable world. 
</P>
<P>
There are other moments of great skill in the writing of "Picturing Will." 
Beattie describes Jody picking up her Leica camera: "You suddenly felt more 
delicate but at the same time more connected to things, the way you felt when 
you slipped a ballet slipper on your foot." She writes of the neo-formality of 
the trendy New York scene, where no one is called Steve or Ed any more, but 
Steven and Edward: 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was into high seriousness so that now even dogs were named Humphrey 
or Raphael." 
</P>
<P>
Her portrait of Haverford's baleful rise in the art world is worthy of Tom 
Wolfe. He takes an overweight Brooklyn painter, renames him Luther, puts him on 
a diet, has his pores cleaned and invests in a $200 shirt which he repossesses 
after the opening. 
</P>
<P>
The novel states clearly the evil of our lightness. But as a novel, it is not 
very successful. Jody, Mel and Wayne are hollow, to be sure, but hollowness 
prolonged becomes tedium. Mel's almost-wise diary makes a point, but we are 
stuck with the almost. 
</P>
<P>
Beattie, at her best, has been able to endow her brittle people with verve, 
wicked humor and a dazzling curve of flight. Here they flap along in a 
discouraged half-light. Even Will, his ordeal past, grows into an adult gray.

LESSONS IN LETTING GO;

<P>
MIDSTREAM BY LE ANNE SCHREIBER (VIKING: $18.95; 307 PP.; 0-670-82819-X) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, A new collection of Mairs' essays, Carnal Acts, will be 
published this year by Harper &amp; Row.

<TEXT>
<P>
For many, the death of a parent provides a baptism into mortality. As long as 
they are alive, our parents stand between us and death just as they once stood 
between us and childhood's monsters. Whatever happens to us, knowing our 
parents have gone through similar experiences and survived, we take heart. The 
parent who dies leaves a child vulnerable in a new way. She stands now at the 
head of the line. Symbolically, at least, she's next. 
</P>
<P>
In "Midstream," Le Anne Schreiber portrays honestly the angry, betrayed, 
bewildered, anxious child who must watch her mother dwindle and die of 
pancreatic cancer. In coming to terms with the complexities of this process, 
she offers each of us painful but ultimately reassuring insight into our own 
capacity for confronting such loss. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual privileges of Schreiber's life set her experience apart from that 
of many. Her parents are comfortable enough financially to afford whatever 
medical treatment her mother requires. She is able to sojourn for weeks at a 
time to Italy; to buy a large house in Upstate New York and renovate it 
extensively, and still to travel to her parents' home in Minnesota whenever she 
is needed. Without a husband, lover or children, she can devote her attention 
fully to her parents, spared the emotional tug-of-war that illness and death 
often initiate in even the most harmonious families. The reader reaps the 
benefits of her privileged circumstances, however, in that, without an outside 
job to distract her, she can devote larger amounts of time than most people 
have to the journal from which "Midstream" is formed. 
</P>
<P>
Some elements of this record, which spans a little more than two years, are 
more successful than others. Clearly, Schreiber intends to set up a tension 
between life-affirming acts, such as buying and transforming an old house, and 
her mother's inexorable decline. Too often, however, the treatment of the 
former seems to strain self-consciously after effect. 
</P>
<P>
In passages describing trout-fishing or tramps through the woods, one hears a 
persistent undertone: How like Annie Dillard I am, discovering and celebrating 
nature! But Dillard's capacity for conveying astonishment is absent. Portions 
treating of her house seem to strive for but generally miss the sense of the 
obsessive involvement that Tracy Kidder or Witold Rybczynski capture. Such 
material works only when it is funny, as when she discovers that the creatures 
she's been aiming to catch are actually catfish, and the trout she's caught 
have been hooked by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The book comes alive, paradoxically, when Schreiber faces her mother's death. 
The relationship between mother and daughter, though not particularly frank, is 
affectionate and forceful: "I have never been able to stand the sight of Mom in 
pain," Schreiber writes at the beginning of their ordeal. "I respond to it 
bodily." Pain, then, is something both must endure in their separate ways, and 
she depicts it in its various forms unflinchingly but without either melodrama 
or ghoulishness. Although, after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, Bea 
Schreiber lives longer than anticipated, recovery is impossible. As her son, 
Mike, himself a doctor, tells his sister, without conscious irony: "They 
succeeded in killing the mother tumor, but the daughters are flourishing." 
</P>
<P>
As Bea's health deteriorates steadily, we experience the involution of the 
small household: "I can hardly remember the last time any of us have talked 
about anything other than Mom's medical condition." Alone with her parents, 
Schreiber feels familial roles shift: "Until now, Mom has led the way, showing 
us by her sustained hope and good spirits that what she is suffering is 
tolerable. . . . Now it is time for us, for Dad and me, to demonstrate by our 
responses to her that what is happening is still tolerable, that she is still 
Bea." 
</P>
<P>
But of course she isn't -- not the Bea she wants to be -- and Schreiber feels 
helpless to get her to "stop desiring the body she had lost." Pressured by her 
brother and his wife to prepare Bea for dying, she reflects wryly, "It is easy 
for someone at a distance to think there is some abstract state called 
'acceptance of death' and that you can maneuver a sick person into it at your 
convenience. Here, on location, Mom is not cooperating." But no one, she 
discovers, can be entirely ready to let go; the day after Bea's death, she 
acknowledges, "I would always have wanted one more contact, no matter how much 
time we had shared. I will always want one more contact." 
</P>
<P>
"This journal is turning to trash," Schreiber observes toward the end. "There 
is too much riot of bodies and souls to bring into ordered telling. . . ." But 
it is precisely the sense of chaos and immediacy that redeems the book. 
</P>
<P>
By drawing us into her mother's dying, Schreiber permits us to share the welter 
of responses such a loss arouses. "Midstream" may not make us entirely ready, 
but it eases and enriches our preparations.

PET STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me predict what will happen if pressure is put on pet stores not to carry 
dogs. Pet stores will go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Now, people who have had bad experiences with sick dogs will say, "Great, 
that's what they deserve," but where will an 8-year-old get his first parakeet? 
As urbanization grows, where is a 6-year-old going to see her first frog? Pet 
stores act like zoos to a vast population. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't they quit carrying dogs? This is obviously the simplest answer: 
economics. The rent in most malls is exorbitant. Dogs are the biggest-ticket 
item. As a pet store owner, I decided years ago not to sell dogs. When asked 
why by customers, I say, "The quality of the animal I can purchase isn't the 
quality I would want to sell." I tell people to go to dog shows, see the best 
of breed, ask questions. The newspaper is full of dogs for sale, and you get to 
see the parents at the same time. Also, as long as there are animals in 
shelters, people should go there first. I'm afraid this falls on deaf ears. 
After all, it takes away the fun of bringing home a cute puppy.

<P>
Morris Dees hits hate groups where it hurts the most -- in their pocketbooks 
("The Long Crusade," by Richard E. Meyer, Dec. 3). But we need laws to protect 
targets of hate based on group differences before damage can be inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
How such laws will stand the tests of constitutionality as to "free speech" 
rights has already been established by Supreme Court decisions and other 
guarantees found in the Bill of Rights and our Constitution. Surely, these 
guarantees, the established civil right laws that prohibit wide areas of 
discrimination in various fields, and our being signatories to the Genocide 
Convention Treaty, can guide legislators and "civil liberty" absolutists in 
drafting laws that would end advocacy of bodily harm based on hate toward human 
beings because of differences. 
</P>
<P>
History teaches us that where differences are not reconciled, wars grow out of 
the conflict.

I was shocked when I read one of your viewers' comments on the Dec. 18 episode 
of "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a viewer completely missing the point of the show! The viewer 
ridiculed the show, claiming that it poked fun at an overweight woman. The 
woman was not overweight! She had a perfect figure except for a large derriere. 
The show highlighted how superficial people can be, judging each other on 
physical traits. Your viewer asked "Whatever happened to intelligent writers?" 
I ask "Whatever happened to intelligent viewers?"

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LAST PLACES: A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH BY LAWRENCE MILLMAN 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 242 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By SONJA BOLLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence Millman recounts his adventures as he traveled the old Viking route 
across the North Atlantic from Norway to Newfoundland. Setting out from Bergen, 
he passed through the Shetland Islands, the Faroes, set in at Iceland, 
Greenland and Labrador, finally arriving in Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
Probably much like the Vikings, Millman strayed from his path whenever he 
sniffed a good story. A whale hunt in the Faroes is too much for him to resist. 
There are the inevitable dangers of primitive travel; On one expedition, 
Millman loses his way in an Icelandic lava field. He includes also the 
descriptions of curious native customs so indispensable to travel writing: In 
an Eskimo village, Millman mortally offends his host by refusing to sleep with 
the hostess. Along the way, Millman collects myths and folktales from the 
people he visits, which, interspersed with his descriptions of land that has 
remained unchanged for eons, lend his narrative a quality of suspension in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tales of traditional life, Millman regales the reader with his 
experiences of modern Nordic life. Recuperating in a Reykjavik Salvation Army 
hostel from a particularly strenuous adventure, Millman finds himself the 
center of a literary controversy during a weekend of heavy drinking. One 
Icelander professes his boozy love for the English language on account of three 
writers -- Shakespeare, Poe and Ray Bradbury -- and immediately begins slurring 
a quote from Henry V: "Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of 
Iceland." This escalates into full-scale warfare when another drinking 
companion defends the honor of the poet Tomas Gudmundsson against all comers. 
In this highly entertaining account, Millman makes the frozen North seem to 
burst with life and color.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: ALL ABOUT EVE; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT DO WOMEN THINK? PERHAPS THE ORIGINAL FIRST LADY COULD TELL US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MY MISCHIEVOUS correspondent -- Patti Garrity of Manhattan Beach -- asks me: 
"What woman in history would you most like to meet?" She says a friend at her 
health club asked the question of her. 
</P>
<P>
She says: "I took all of two seconds to say, 'Boy, would I like a word or two 
with Eve.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, a ludicrous question. It has no built-in rules. Is one 
limited to women in history who are now dead? Or is one allowed to choose such 
living legends as Katharine Hepburn, Queen Elizabeth or Greta Garbo? 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the language barrier would eliminate such women as Cleopatra, who 
spoke no English; Boadicea, the fierce British queen who almost drove the 
Romans out of England but who spoke only ancient Celtic, and Eve herself, who 
spoke God-knows-what language. 
</P>
<P>
We do know that Adam's and Eve's first words (and thus history's) were perfect 
palindromes: When Adam said, "Madam, I'm Adam," Eve replied, "Eve." 
</P>
<P>
From Mark Twain's translation of Adam's diary, we know that it was Eve who 
named the animals, not Adam. I'd like to ask her how she came up with 
hippopotamus and platypus. Also I'd like to ask her where Cain's mate came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
Language also eliminates Marie Antoinette. Marie probably had learned some 
English from the court, but I doubt that it would permit much badinage between 
us. But I'd like to ask her whether she said, "If they have no bread, let them 
eat cake." She may have been frivolous, but she was also compassionate. I 
suspect that what she really said was, "If they have no bread, give them cake." 
</P>
<P>
One thinks inevitably of Joan of Arc, but I wouldn't know what to say to her, 
even if she spoke English. I would like her to know that I think she got a raw 
deal from the English court that tried her for heresy and sentenced her to the 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
Will Durant described Madame de Pompadour as "one of the most remarkable women 
in history, dowered with such beauty and grace as blinded most men to her 
sins." She not only seduced Louis XV, but protected Voltaire and other 
dangerous thinkers, built palaces and chateaux, stimulated the arts, obtained 
pensions, titles and commissions for worthy men, and virtually ruled France 
from the king's bed. But if I were to seek an audience with Pompadour, she 
would probably say, "Please rid me of that scrivener." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there are too many barriers to a conversation with historic women. 
Would we regard them as living or as resurrected? Would we talk about their 
ends? Cleopatra, Boadicea, Marie Antoinette and Joan of Arc all died by 
violence. I don't know what happened to Eve, but she was certainly in some 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
It might be fun to talk with Isadora Duncan; she was so free of spirit. I'd 
like to know what she thinks about right-to-life versus free choice. But there 
are some heroic women whom I might find too righteous. For example, I'm not 
sure that I'd enjoy a conversation with Carrie Nation. 
</P>
<P>
But truly, I'd have almost nothing in common with any of these women. I don't 
care what person I'm talking with, the conversation tends to fall into small 
talk, and how could I talk small talk with someone who has never heard of TV, 
movies or baseball? 
</P>
<P>
I have no small talk at all about Creation, ancient Egypt, Roman Britain, the 
French Revolution or interpretive dance. I'd probably start out by suggesting a 
drink, and things would degenerate from there. 
</P>
<P>
I have had the pleasure of private conversations with some women of note: Julie 
Andrews, Debbie Reynolds, Olivia De Havilland, Ella Fitzgerald, Ginger Rogers, 
Tempest Storm. All were charming, but the conversations were in fact 
interviews, and the women were understandably cautious. I didn't feel that I 
had uncovered any secrets, and by now, no doubt, they have all forgotten our 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
And what would be the point of these conversations for the historic women? Why 
would they be willing to talk with me? Who would arrange our meetings? Their 
press agents? God? 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea is fantasy. Frankly, I have never found much to be gained by 
talking to celebrities. One may interview political figures to extract 
something of public interest, but I doubt that any conversation between and me 
and such persons as Katharine Hepburn, Queen Elizabeth or Greta Garbo would 
yield many intimacies or exciting ideas. 
</P>
<P>
I'm ready, though, any time you are, Katharine, Elizabeth and Greta. That also 
goes for Chris Evert, Jane Fonda, Gloria Allred and Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I think the woman I'd most like to talk with would be my wife. I 
mean really talk. I've always wondered what she thinks.

AN EXECUTIVE SUITE IS TEMPTING, BUT THE WORKPLACE IS WHERE THE HEART IS

<P>
I LOVE WORKING at home," says my friend Sabina. Maybe I'm missing something, I 
think nervously. I've been working at home for 14 years, and the best thing I 
can say is that it has its moments. 
</P>
<P>
Not these moments. "I sit in my office stark-naked and call high-powered 
executives who are making $3 million a year," says Sabina, who publishes 
newsletters in her den. "And I have an overwhelming sense of power because they 
don't know what I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
For her sake, I hope that video phones don't become popular -- though it 
wouldn't faze me a bit. I can't write a word unless I'm perfectly turned out, 
made-up and accessorized. Of course, one of the disadvantages of working at 
home is that there's nobody around to appreciate my efforts. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there's nobody to criticize them, either. "You don't spend 
hours in boring meetings or dealing with office politics," Sabina reminds me. 
"When you work at home, you can be much more productive." 
</P>
<P>
But while fax machines, computers, modems and copiers have made the home office 
more feasible, they've also made it as isolated as Walden Pond. "Sometimes, I'm 
afraid that I'll lose my ability to speak and become a hermit," says Matt 
Weurker, a cartoonist who does most of his communicating from his basement 
office by fax. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of nice to take the pencil sketch down to the paper and chat with 
the writers and editors," he admits. "But the fax has eliminated that," he 
complains. "Now my only audience is my dog." 
</P>
<P>
You can't beat a dog for company. Sabina has a German shepherd. "Shane's an 
ideal co-worker," she says. "He doesn't spread nasty rumors, he doesn't 
back-stab. He always barks at the Fed Ex guy. He never falls down on the job." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there are some things a dog can't do. For years, I've wished that my 
pugs, Bess and Stella, could speak. They don't have to screen my phone calls; I 
just want them to say "Good job, Margo" whenever I meet a deadline or get a 
plum assignment. But even if they could speak, they wouldn't be able to allay 
the outside world's underlying suspicions that I'm not really working. People 
who work outside the home always imagine that I'm lying on the sofa watching 
"Oprah." They believe that since I don't have a "real" office, my job doesn't 
count. 
</P>
<P>
"What a day," my husband, Duke, moans as he trudges through the front door and 
collapses on the sofa. I brace for disaster. "The receptionist had a fight with 
her boyfriend, the messenger had a fender bender, and the copier broke," he 
says gravely. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, my day seems dull and insignificant. Yet, in fact, I wrote this 
column, researched another and did my billing. I also took my assistants, Bess 
and Stella, to the vet, picked up the cleaning and did the laundry. (When you 
work at home, you wind up doing all the household chores.) 
</P>
<P>
Is anyone impressed? "I'm exhausted," says Duke. He may be exhausted from 
putting out other people's fires, but at least when he comes home his business 
day is done. When you work at home, the business day is never done. You work in 
the morning, you work late at night, you work on weekends, even on holidays. 
Every time you walk past the spare bedroom, the cursor on your computer blinks 
reproachfully. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I decided that it was time to seek regular employment. I imagined 
myself in expensive clothes, sitting in a corner office with a panoramic view 
of the city and an arrogant male secretary who tells everyone that I'm in a 
meeting. I didn't know what I could do to earn such a spot in corporate heaven, 
but I was willing to do anything to get out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
So I drove downtown in bumper-to-bumper traffic to have lunch with my friend 
Monica. She works on the 16th floor of one of those ultramodern, 
ultra-impersonal skyscrapers that sway during earthquakes. The air in the lobby 
was thick with paranoia. "No tie?" asked one executive in the elevator of a 
daring co-worker. "Living on the edge?" 
</P>
<P>
I resisted a powerful urge to flee and walked into Monica's office. I felt like 
I was at the zoo. My friend was sitting in a claustrophobic glass cubicle, with 
no door and a disquieting view of her similarly encaged colleagues. "How can 
you work here?" I stammered. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much privacy," Monica admitted as she hunched under her desk to 
adjust her panty hose. "But management wants to make sure that we're 
productive. This way, any superior can see exactly what we're doing." I clicked 
the heels of my suede pumps three times. "There's no place like home," I said. 
"There's no place like home."

PAGE AFTER PAGE: MEMOIRS OF A WAR-TORN PHOTOGRAPHER BY TIM PAGE (ATHENEUM:

<P>
By Gerald Nicosia, Nicosia, author of Memory Babe: A Critical Biography of Jack 
Kerouac (Viking/Penguin), currently is at work on Home to War: A History of the 
Vietnam Veterans' Movement for Norton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Page's memoirs, "Page After Page," begin most appropriately at a reunion of 
Vietnam journalists in New York in 1985. Like Gloria Emerson, who was given a 
mock Purple Heart for her several "tours of duty" covering the war for the New 
York Times, Page demonstrates that he and his fellow war correspondents never 
really left that lovely, ravaged nation. As much as the veterans themselves, 
they have carried its scars with them throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Page is known throughout the world for his powerful photographs of the war in 
Vietnam, often shot from the very heart of the hottest action (he was wounded 
severely four times, and actually brought "Dead on Arrival" to Long Binh 
Hospital in 1969 after stepping on a mine, his heart stopping and starting 
three times) and for his magnificently lush, bucolic images of post-war 
Vietnam. But few people knew the cost -- both physical and psychic -- of 
producing his enormously valuable documentary art. 
</P>
<P>
Time-Life Inc., like the other publications that paid for his work, cared 
mainly that his photographs were sufficiently graphic and lurid to attract 
readership; and when Page no longer could work -- half his body paralyzed from 
the severe damage inflicted by the mine explosion, and his mind crippled by 
post-traumatic stress disorder -- they saw fit to compensate him a mere $200 a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Page retaliated by suing The Inc. (as he called it) for alleged damages 
incurred on the job. The landmark case was settled out of court, largely 
because, as he writes, "the press roots for the press," and also because the 
case was being heard in the late 1970s, a time when "newsmen were going MIA and 
KIA (missing in action and killed in action) like ninepins" during the Khmer 
Rouge takeover of Cambodia. But what the "war-torn correspondent" wanted, as 
his book makes clear, was not so much financial restitution as the chance to 
tell his story to the world. 
</P>
<P>
That need to talk about the war is just one of the many striking similarities 
between Page and the Vietnam veterans -- a resemblance all the more notable 
since Page took a route to Vietnam far different from that of most of the vets. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a British sailor killed during World War II, Page was adopted by a 
childless accountant and his wife in Kent, England, where he had a placid if 
somewhat lonely childhood, and chess and bicycling were his two greatest 
passions. There is little in these early years to hint at the origins of his 
subsequent heroism. He was definitely tuned in to American rock 'n' roll, which 
was beating down some of the stuffy walls of respectability about him, and 
reading Orwell made him dream of being a forestry officer in Burma. 
</P>
<P>
At 17, he dropped out of school to study forestry in Wales, but a serious 
motorcycle accident laid him up for months. By the time he could walk again, he 
longed for adventures greater than planting trees. With his pregnant girlfriend 
in tow, he took the ferry to Belgium, intent on seeing the world. Undaunted 
when the girl was dragged home by her aunt, he ended up buying a VW bus and 
setting off like Captain Ahab on a monomaniacal trek across Asia, bound for 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The first third of Page's book is interesting not so much for the things he did 
-- though it is an amazing odyssey of countries, tropical diseases, drugs and 
jobs ranging from light-bulb salesman to black marketeer -- as for the age at 
which he did them. At 18, he could swing a drug deal in a variety of languages 
and had a keen eye and ear for the multifarious corruptions of the Orient. 
</P>
<P>
The same compulsion for detail that later enhanced his photography translates 
into a precise, sharply focused prose alive with the nuances of both British 
and veterans' slang (known as Namspeak), which Page uses to bring to vivid 
light a panoply of colorful people and places. Though it is a small quibble, 
there is almost too much detail of the illicit drug world that comprised so 
much of Page's formative experience. One could live without knowing how to 
measure opium in cartridge caps or how to smoke it with a bamboo stem. 
</P>
<P>
When a journalist friend, Martin Stuart-Fox, went on leave from the UPI office 
in Laos, Page slipped into his job simply as another adventure: "I had caught 
the media bug," he writes. "Journalism in the Third World is a knot of intrigue 
and camaraderie. The handful of miscreants that made up Vientiane's corps were 
privy to front-line state councils of the kind novels are made of. We were 
sitting on the scene of 'The Ugly American,' the philosophies of Malraux. I 
knew the whole cast of characters, had started to playact myself." 
</P>
<P>
In early 1964, the man who was later to become "the legendary Tim Page" was 
just an unusually naive and compassionate kid with a 35mm Nikon camera. 
Although he had a sensitivity to things Asian -- stopping, for instance, to 
absorb the tranquility of Buddhist temples while other Westerners kept mostly 
to the fancy hotels or sleazy brothels -- he had virtually no sense of the 
mortal implications of international power plays then taking place in Southeast 
Asia. It was "an insane situation which at first seemed just like having a good 
time, making a largish wad of money and playing at dangerous big boys' games." 
</P>
<P>
When the military attempted a coup in Vientiane, Page hopped on his new Cotton 
250cc street scrambler and rode heedlessly through a hail of bullets to 
photograph the revolution in progress. He then carried the film through 25 
kilometers of embattled countryside to the UPI office in Bangkok. As a result 
of the scoop, his future "was printed in seven lines" -- a cable from UPI 
beginning "PLEASE OFFER TIM PAGE FIRM DEAL FOR THREE MONTHS AS PHOTOGRAPHER IN 
VIETNAM . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Page arrived in Vietnam in February of 1965, just a month ahead of the U.S. 
Marines. On his first assignment, he witnessed the bayonetting of a Viet Cong 
suspect and got so sick he couldn't use his camera, for which UPI gave him a 
"public bollocking." From that time on, he "never turned away again." 
</P>
<P>
Fired allegedly for laziness and smoking dope, Page switched to an assignment 
for Paris Match just in time for Operation Starlight, the first big action in 
which the Marines were supposed to crush a main-force VC regiment but instead 
took a beating. For Page, it also brought the shock of his own pierced 
neutrality. Trapped in an overrun firebase, with the supposedly friendly forces 
changing sides and firing into the American compound, Page picked up a rifle 
and killed his first Viet Cong. 
</P>
<P>
To keep from going crazy, Page, like the veterans themselves, has to numb 
himself completely -- and again like many of the vets, he uses ample quantities 
of booze and drugs to achieve this end. The second half of the book tells a 
progressively sadder and darker story as more and more of his journalist 
friends disappear or are killed. After his fourth major wounding, he is shipped 
to the States for extensive rehabilitation in Walter Reed Hospital, but away 
from Vietnam, he is so depressed that he longs to return to the adrenaline high 
of the life-or-death situations he has just come from. 
</P>
<P>
Like the classic PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) victim, he alternates 
between bouts of suicidal despair and violently destructive rage. No one wants 
to hear his tragic tales of a war that Americans preferred to forget, and when 
he tries to force his wife to listen, she too wants to shut him up. He beats 
her, and his marriage breaks down. There are probably half a million American 
veterans who could fit their lives easily into Page's profile. 
</P>
<P>
After a countercultural romp in California that is rather self-consciously out 
of Kerouac with more than a good measure of Hunter S. Thompson-style decadence 
thrown in, Page returns to England in the late 1970s. His true recovery from 
the war begins only when he is given an assignment by the Observer, in 1980, to 
photograph the five-year-old Socialist Republic of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Saigon, now dubbed Ho Chi Minh City, Page begins to discover the 
deepest horror of the American invasion, the way it has time-warped the 
Vietnamese out of their own culture. Where the rest of Vietnam is attempting to 
build an equitable future for most of its citizens, the rootless Americanized 
Viets in Ho Chi Minh City still are playing the rock 'n' roll tapes made from 
Armed Forces Radio, still are caught in the endless spiral of flourishing black 
markets and universal shortages. Meanwhile, Amerasian children scuttle hungry 
and scorned, a burden to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The healing comes for Page -- as for so many American veterans who have 
returned to Southeast Asia -- in learning to appreciate the humanity of his 
former enemy. He meets the Viet Cong commander of the unit that had ambushed 
him while he accompanied the 173rd Airborne, and instead of hostility he finds 
a comradeship that can only come from shared experience: "He showed me 
black-and-white frames, liberated wire-service prints, which I had taken on 
assignment in those initial years of the war. We ended up as brothers, arms 
entwined, commiserating on common losses, half-dissipated in nostalgia. It was 
all rushing back, not then painfully, but I could feel the seeds of exorcism 
being sown, the light of understanding dawning, a relief, a fascination to dig 
deeper." 
</P>
<P>
Page feeds his growing curiosity about the area that has so changed his life 
through extensive photographic explorations of Sri Lanka, especially of 
Buddhist shrines, and a second expedition back to Vietnam in 1985, on the 10th 
anniversary of the fall of Saigon. His second time back after the war, Page 
finds the final key to his past. This time he avoids the pitfall of mere 
nostalgia -- the vice of supercilious Westerners -- and attempts to see "a 
familiar place now stilled, the people at peace. It was now possible to see how 
incredibly beautiful the country was, to see the Confucian heritage, the layers 
and veneers of various colonial powers, the core of what had drawn me to the 
region originally." 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Page's book of memoirs is its own climax, for like the two 
collections of photographs he has previously published, it is clearly a way for 
him to lay to rest the ghosts of his own complicity in what has been one of the 
greater human tragedies of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this remarkable memoir is an unqualified assertion of the human 
spirit's endless power of self-transformation: "The ones who did not make it 
are still with us all in spirit, their collective karma echoes in our minds, an 
inspiration. We grieve not, we smile with life."

VETERANS' AFFAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After almost 40 years, the long- awaited memorials are finally being erected 
and dedicated to and for both the living and dead veterans of the Korean 
"Conflict." 
</P>
<P>
For the purposes of a book, I would appreciate hearing from readers who served 
in that war (June, 1950-July, 1953). I am interested in what kinds of welcomes 
awaited the returning veterans when they set foot on U.S. soil again. 
</P>
<P>
What did their loved ones, their families, friends or local citizens say to 
them? How were they received back into their communities? What kind of 
obstacles confronted them as newly returned veterans from such a distant and 
relatively unpopular war?

UNDERWOOD OVERSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As publishers of the new book, "Gilbert Stanley Underwood" (by Joyce Zaitlin), 
we could not help noting the following inconsistencies in your mention of the 
book in Book Review for Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
You describe the book as "thin," with "185 pages." The book has 202 pages -- 
only slightly thinner than the next book reviewed, whose size is not referred 
to. . . . How does a page count help the reader evaluate the significance or 
beauty of the book? 
</P>
<P>
2. You say the work is "modestly illustrated." However, there are more than 100 
illustrations, some in full color. 
</P>
<P>
3. You call Underwood's career that of a "maverick." As you are surely aware, 
such a descriptive term in colloquial usage means one who follows an 
independent position, refusing to conform to that of his group. 
</P>
<P>
Both his joining of architecture to the environment and his Art Deco designs, 
while at the growing tip of his time, were still expressions of a wider awaking 
to these possibilities. Underwood, it seems, just did it better. 
</P>
<P>
One main goal of Zaitlin's book was to provide depth and insight to both 
professional and casual observers into some of the country's finest public 
buildings and lodges. While the book may be examined for its relative success 
in attaining this goal, what, in contrast, was the purpose of your review?

IMMACULATE DECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Immaculate Conception" (a poem by Louise Erdrich, Book Review, Dec. 
24): Evidently Erdrich doesn't know the difference between the Immaculate 
Conception and the Virgin Birth. Quite clearly her lines concern the latter, 
not the former. 
</P>
<P>
The Immmaculate Conception is the doctrine that the Virgin Mary, from the 
moment of her conception in St. Anne's womb, was kept free from original sin.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SCARY KISSES BY BRAD GOOCH (POCKET BOOKS: $7.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the novels of the "Brat Pack" writers focused on one small, self-indulgent 
group during the early '80s, much of their work already is dated. Brad Gooch's 
attempt to evoke that blighted milieu is about as enjoyable as poking a needle 
in your gum to evoke your last root canal. 
</P>
<P>
"Scary Kisses" features all the cliches of the genre: vapid characters, 
disjointed conversations, New York locales, drugs, disinterested sex and huge 
dollops of ennui. Much of the dialogue is written in screenplay format, an 
affectation that does nothing to relieve the improbability of a previously 
monosyllabic lunk suddenly remarking, "The carhops at the Fountain of Youth get 
older faster I guess." "Kisses" is set in the seamy world of high-fashion 
modeling, so everyone's clothes are described in detail, down to the brands of 
their sneakers. Proust used styles of dress to illustrate the tastes and social 
positions of his characters; Gooch seems to be writing copy for 
department-store ads.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THREE TALES BY GUSTAVE FLAUBERT (NAL: $4.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gustave Flaubert's last completed work, "Three Tales" was widely admired during 
his lifetime. "A Simple Heart," a poignant account of the life of a devoted 
servant, recalls the lucid, insightful prose of "Madame Bovary." 
</P>
<P>
Like the novels "Salambo" and "The Temptation of St. Anthony," the short 
stories "The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitalier" and "Herodias" anticipate 
the exoticism of late 19th- Century Decadent prose, but Flaubert was too 
disciplined a writer to indulge in the flamboyant excesses of that extravagant 
style. In Oscar Wilde's play (and other Decadent works), the story of Salome is 
an opulent fable of passion, vengeance and the conflict between lust and 
spirituality. Flaubert reduces Salome and Iaokanann (John the Baptist) to 
secondary characters and focuses his attention on the Tetrarch, Herod Antipas, 
turning an Oriental tragedy into a study of a political man whose moral 
cowardice makes him a pawn in the hands of less scrupulous players.

THE ANOMIE FARM; 
</P>
<P>
ROOTIE KAZOOTIE BY LAWRENCE NAUMOFF (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $18.95; 262 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Larsen, Larsen's An American Memory is in Anchor paperback. He is at 
work on a second novel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this second novel (his first was "The Night of the Weeping Women"), Lawrence 
Naumoff attempts a satire -- or so it seems -- of the moral unrootedness and 
consequent marital vagaries of domestic modern life. The trouble is that in 
order to write about lives in a morally shallow world, Naumoff has summoned up 
a cast of equally shallow characters, none of whom, except now and then as if 
by fleeting accident, lays claim to a reader's affections. The result is an 
oddly wooden, half-hearted, artificial novel that looks in vain for a heart to 
give it the pulse of life. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline and Richard, childless and in their late 30s, have been married for 14 
years, living in a small house in rural North Carolina on the patch of land 
that they had once idealistically thought could become their own 
self-sustaining Eden. As the novel opens, however, things aren't going so well. 
Caroline has begun to get on the laconic Richard's nerves (she talks far too 
much, as against his far too little), and Richard himself has fallen into the 
clutches (as yet without consummation) of Cynthia, a rich and glamorous 
divorcee down the road. 
</P>
<P>
The engaging comedy of manners and morals that might ensue -- as Richard at 
last leaves Caroline, as Caroline goes on a jealous rampage in response, as 
things flare hot and then grow depressingly chilly between Richard and Cynthia 
-- is jeopardized from the outset by Naumoff's telltale shortcuts and vain 
efforts to give depth and background to his surface-only characters. 
</P>
<P>
Disconcertingly often, for example, he falls into a vacuously hastened language 
that characterizes only in the broadest of cartoon strokes -- as when he 
explains in hurried telegraph-ese that Cynthia "had . . . felt a strange 
homesick longing and kinship to (Richard's) simple way of life and his quiet 
style," that she had "called Richard and . . . pow, she was just knocked over, 
completely and totally knocked over," and, lest one continues (as one does) to 
doubt, that "She was truly crazy about him." 
</P>
<P>
Fruitful dramatic comedy needs something at its center, and one assumes early 
on that the center in this novel is to be the figure of the abandoned Caroline, 
who is wronged both by the ersatz-minded Cynthia and by the seldom-talking and 
apparently hunkish Richard. 
</P>
<P>
And yet Caroline, too, although the only one here capable of demonstrating 
either humor or passion, is treated with equally damaging effect to Naumoff's 
get-it-over-with-quickly characterization: "Caroline taught first grade and she 
loved her children and they loved her. Lately, though, . . . all the paperwork 
and the bureaucracy and so forth . . . had begun to get her down." Such 
flurries of dead phrases, here as so often elsewhere in the book, reveal 
Naumoff skimming in an unthinking, pell-mell shorthand across his material in 
order to get -- where? 
</P>
<P>
What a reader gradually comes to realize is that, in fact, there's no place for 
Naumoff finally to get at all, since the inside of his characters, if they have 
an inside at all, is a world that seems wholly closed to him. In the middle of 
the book, Caroline follows an apparently stray dog deep into the woods, where 
she comes upon a rustic cabin inhabited by a beautifully perfect young man and 
a beautifully perfect young woman (and, of course, by their dog. Says Caroline: 
"I love your dog, though. He's really special"). 
</P>
<P>
The cabin, of course, symbolizes the Eden that Caroline and Richard are said to 
have dreamed of once, a self-sufficient, pure, untroubled world of two. And in 
this symbolic center-point of the book, if anywhere, one could fairly expect 
the inner substance and stabilizing verities of Caroline's true self to be 
revealed. What one discovers, though, are just trivial inanities expressed in 
language to match. 
</P>
<P>
To the questioning of her rustic but advertisement-perfect hosts, Caroline 
says, "Actually, I feel really great now. Really. Just sitting here in this 
beautiful house is making me feel really, really good." At bedtime (she stays 
overnight), she explains that "It's so quiet and so really special out there 
I'd just like to sleep in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
As if aware of the inward poverty of his characters and of their consequent 
dramatic inertia, Naumoff reaches clumsily for authorial intensifiers and 
fillers of various sorts: "Who could know, who could ever have guessed that 
long ago this handsome man and these two gorgeous women . . . would later find 
themselves stuck in the time warp of the broken life . . . " Or, somewhat more 
grammatically: "Had a team of scientists examined this twentieth-century 
couple, how much could they possibly have discovered about them?" 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the last question answers itself: not much, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring this novel-stew of cut-outs and surfaces as best he can, Naumoff 
resolves things at last with a comic coincidence that will surprise no one, a 
medical deus ex machina and a country homily. Along the way, Caroline provides 
some briefly raucous farce while driving a tractor and wearing a piece of 
"Cynthia's new lingerie on her head"; Cynthia's teen-aged children parade their 
materialism; the craven Cynthia demonstrates the depths of her intellect ("You 
have to be loved and you have to give love, and when you do that, all of the 
rest of the good follows. I've thought a lot about it"), and Richard gives one 
of his longer speeches ("It's just everything, okay?"). 
</P>
<P>
What keeps this novel, finally, from coming to life is not its lack of ambition 
-- it endeavors to take on, at one point or another, all kinds of targets -- 
but instead its own peculiar lack of a real substance. "Times had changed," 
writes Naumoff. "People had changed. What was once wrong might no longer be 
wrong. Things had been lost. Reasons for acting or thinking in a certain way 
had been lost. The sense of absolute right and wrong had failed. People tried 
to do their best, but no one was sure anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not a convincing apologia, itself falling into yet another authorial 
cliche, and one furthermore unconnected to the characters in the book, who in 
fact aren't particularly bothered by questions of that sort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to figure out," Naumoff writes yet again. "Some of the best-looking 
women ended up with these guys you wouldn't have thought they'd look at twice. 
You saw it and it made you think." If, one might ask, that really could be 
called thinking, or perception.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: SIMPLE DIGNITY FOR 'THE OLD MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The single finest reading of a literary classic I have come across was done by 
Charlton Heston. You should hear him read "The Old Man and the Sea." 
</P>
<P>
"Hemingway was such a joy because there was not one extra word; it was all so 
beautifully constructed," Heston said by telephone from his house in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Heston recalled that he read "The Old Man and the Sea" for Caedmon about a 
dozen years ago in a small studio in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not have to do any preparation because I knew the book so well," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Heston also recorded the Hemingway story "The Snows of Kilimanjaro." So well 
does he know that story that in the interview he began reciting the opening 
paragraph verbatim. A friend of mine thinks that that reading is even better 
than "Old Man." 
</P>
<P>
As we were talking, Heston interjected, "Hold the phone a second while I go to 
my book case." 
</P>
<P>
Returning, he said, "I just measured the space that Hemingway's work, and books 
about him, take up here. About eight feet. I've got most of his first 
editions." 
</P>
<P>
Any of them signed? 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I came close," Heston replied. "It's kind of a sad story. Gary Cooper, 
as you may know, was close to Hemingway. One night in 1960, Coop was over at my 
house for dinner and he saw my first editions. He was amazed that they weren't 
signed, and I explained that I had never actually had the pleasure of meeting 
Mr. Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
"Coop said, 'Then you must join us in Ketchum in the fall and go grouse 
shooting. Bring the books and Ernest will sign them.' 
</P>
<P>
"But you know the picture business. I suddenly had a contract to do 'El Cid' 
and off I went to Spain in the fall and never got to Idaho to hunt with 
Hemingway. And the next spring, of course, he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
I can't imagine that Hemingway would not love Heston's reading of "The Old Man 
and the Sea." It is a strong voice, extremely self-assured and attuned to 
nuance. Most important, it is a voice of dignity for a character, Santiago, who 
personified simple dignity. 
</P>
<P>
In reading "The Old Man and the Sea," Heston gives Santiago's voice just a 
slight Cuban accent. To my amazement, that accent never varies, a tribute to 
Heston's devotion to his craft. And it is not so heavy an accent that it 
becomes intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker, the story of an old Cuban, the 
great marlin he catches and his battles with the sharks was told to Hemingway 
in 1935. When he finally began to set it down on paper nearly 16 years later, 
it came very easily. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote it in eight months, in late 1950 and early 1951. Then he put it away 
for a year, worried that so short a book (36,000 words) would have trouble 
being accepted by a publisher and by readers. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker writes that agent Leland Hayward flew down to Hemingway's farm in 
Cuba in early 1952 and came up with the idea to get Life magazine to run "The 
Old Man and the Sea" in a single edition. Scribners, Hemingway's publisher, 
also proved to be very receptive to publishing a short book, perhaps believing 
that it was his finest work, although that is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
Life ran "The Old Man and the Sea" in September, 1952, and 5 million copies of 
the magazine were sold in 48 hours. When the book came out, it too was an 
instant best seller. For it, Hemingway won the 1952 Pulitzer Prize, and the 
book certainly contributed to his winning the Nobel Prize for literature in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
I think Heston's will stand as the greatest reading of Hemingway -- and until 
now, it has been one of the only readings because the Hemingway estate guarded 
the rights so closely. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to the negotiating skills of Books on Tape, founder Duvall Y. 
Hecht, the Costa Mesa firm, has secured the rights to most of the rest of 
Hemingway and is putting out the books to be read. 
</P>
<P>
Hecht is one of the innovators in the audio-books business, but he and I have a 
disagreement over the right voice for the Hemingway books. He had Wolfram 
Kandinsky read "The Sun Also Rises," which has just been added to the Books on 
Tape catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
I know Kandinsky has his fans, but I have to say I could not get through his 
reading of "The Sun Also Rises" because, to me, his voice is too nasal and 
lacks the masculine quality I think the Hemingway books demand. The voice 
becomes a distraction, which for me is the greatest danger in the readings of 
great literature. 
</P>
<P>
Heston's readings, on the other hand, are worth owning. "The Old Man and the 
Sea" is on two cassettes and sells for $15.95. "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is on 
one cassette for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
They are available in book stores or you can get them from Caedmon if you place 
an order for $30 or more. Since the total price of "Old Man" and "Snows" falls 
a little short of that, I recommend filling out your order with "Ernest 
Hemingway Reads," a rare recording of the author's voice on one cassette for 
$9.95. I should note that, ironically for a man with such a macho persona, 
Hemingway sounds a bit squeaky at times on this recording. 
</P>

OUTTAKES: DIVORCE, MAGAZINE STYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
It's hardly new for stars to hide their marital woes when they're being 
interviewed. But in the case of Tom Cruise's cover-boy blitz -- tied to his 
starring role in "Born on the Fourth of July" -- the timing was unfortunate: 
Just days after the current issue of US magazine hit the stands, with Cruise 
waxing enthusiastic about marriage to Mimi Rogers, he and the wife announced 
they're Splitsville. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise told US he "works at" keeping his marriage going: "If you're willing to 
do that . . . for me at least it pays off a hundredfold." 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokeswoman, US editor Carol Wallace said, "When we put the questions 
about his marriage to him point blank, he answered them -- and we had no reason 
not to take him at his word." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to early tabloid rumblings about the Cruise-Rogers marital woes, 
Wallace added, "I'm not about to use the tabloids as source material." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Stone, however -- which had Cruise on its Jan. 11 cover -- dropped in 
some references to the tabs' claims. "When our writer (Trip Gabriel) asked Tom 
about his marriage, and some of the problems we'd heard about, Tom never came 
right out and denied them," said senior editor Peter Travers. "He sort of 
talked around the issues -- which indicated, to us, that there was some smoke 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Travers added, "We feel misled by what happened, but we don't feel betrayed. At 
the time (of the interview in November), we had a sense that he and Mimi might 
have been trying to work something out. So, you know, it could have gone the 
other way." 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 25 issue of Time -- with Cruise gracing the cover -- also dropped in a 
tabloid reference as a safety valve. Otherwise, said film critic Richard 
Corliss, who penned the portrait, Cruise denied any marital rumblings. "His was 
an Academy Award-worthy performance. Apparently he gave it to all the 
reporters," said Corliss, who doesn't hold a grudge. "Every celebrity plays a 
game. Tom Cruise was giving one of his best performances by playing Tom 
Cruise." 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, whose mug decorates the February cover of Premiere, was Playboy's 
January main interview. He told interviewer Robert Scheer that aside from his 
agent, only his wife "understands what I really want." 
</P>
<P>
In the same piece, Cruise declared, "People so easily -- blindly -- believe 
what they read." Pat H. Broeske

TO KIDS, THEY'VE ALWAYS been as important as the text. Now children's book 
illustrations are commanding respect from adults as well for both their 
artistic and investment value. 
</P>
<P>
Which explains the origin of Every Picture Tells a Story, a new L.A. art 
gallery devoted to the show and sale of original art from children's 
literature. Pencil drawings by contemporary artists such as Barry Moser ("Jump 
on Over!") and Jane Dyer ("Piggins") sell for $100 ; larger, more elaborate 
work by leaders in the genre -- Chris Van Allsburg ("Two Bad Ants"), Don Wood 
("King Bidgood") -- go for up to $10,000.

IT LOOKS LIKE a new train museum but Allied Model Trains in Culver City is not 
-- it's just the "largest train store ever built." The confusion is justified 
because architect James Mount designed the building to look like Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
The light fixtures are streamline moderne; the foyer is domed and the checkout 
stands are designed to look like ticket counters. 
</P>
<P>
Old as well as new trains are for sale here -- vintage Lionel or other antique 
toy trains and clever reproductions including Lionel and Lionel look-alikes. As 
for new trains, the big, weatherproof LGB trains are favored by today's 
children and used outdoors in garden railroads by adults. There is even a big, 
fully operational model of the famous orange-and-red Daylight locomotive, the 
most expensive thing in the store at about $8,500, and smaller scales, or 
sizes, including HO, N and the diminutive Z, which is small enough to keep in a 
coin purse. Owner Allen Drucker says he is not done yet. "I have always wanted 
enough room to set up toy train displays like the department stores did around 
Christmas time when I was a child," and to that end he has plans for some "very 
elaborate layouts" for the six 12-foot-wide windows.

CROSS-COUNTRY skiers, or those with a yen to try, need not trek all the way to 
the Sierra Nevada to find good cross-country terrain. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most accessible Nordic ski areas is freeway close at 8,831-foot Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Pinos in the Los Padres National Forest. The Mt. Pinos turnoff is at Frazier 
Park, north of Gorman (on Interstate 5, halfway from Los Angeles to 
Bakersfield). The area provides 14 miles of set track and 21 miles of marked 
wilderness trails, ranging in difficulty from easy to advanced. One moderate 
3-mile trail with a 600-foot elevation gain reaches the Mt. Pinos summit. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mt. Pinos primarily is a day-use area, snow camping is available in 
established campgrounds. Facilities are limited, but cross-country rentals and 
lessons, food and some accommodations are available in Frazier Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded information on snow and road conditions is available by calling (805)

We recently put our family cocker spaniel out of his misery -- the poor dog had 
developed cataracts and chronic ear infections. Hardly a normal condition for a 
dog 6 years old; the vet credits congenital defects due to inbreeding of the 
most popular breed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He probably could have been nursed along for another few years on systemic 
antibiotics, but there was no guarantee that the quality of his life would have 
improved, nor did it seem quite right to spend so much money, given the far 
greater needs we have as a society. 
</P>

Next time we get a dog, we'll go to a private breeder, or better yet, adopt 
from the pound. These animals so badly need a home, and "mutts" are often 
easier to get along with than highly wired pure breeds. We've learned our 
lesson, which basically boils down to responsibility on the part of pet 
breeders and owners. Too bad people don't take a course in pet care so they 
appreciate the full magnitude of the responsibilities and costs before buying 
that adorable little thing in the window.

CONTROL FREAKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding control freaks ("Who's the Boss?" by Margo Kaufman, Dec. 3): Power 
trips belong to a dying paradigm. A win-win partnership model is emerging in 
fields as broad as world politics and as close as our own families. To reduce 
the number of future control freaks, we should be raising children with 
respect, learning how to share decision making with our partners and families 
and taking better care of ourselves and our own self-esteem.

STAGE WEEK: 'DANCING' -- AGORAPHOBIC LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As John Banach's "Naked Dancing" (opening this weekend at the Colony Studio 
Theatre in Silver Lake) begins, Annie hasn't been out of the house in five 
years. Now her parents have decided to cure her agoraphobia by forcing her out. 
They've taken her food, pulled the fuses, disconnected the phone. Annie has 
just spent three days in darkness, without food. Now Frank -- who pretends to 
be someone he's not -- shows up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The writer (who promises that despite the dark subject matter, "You will laugh 
throughout"), is on particularly familiar turf here. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother's agoraphobic, my girlfriend, my best friend and two of my 
(acting-writing) students," noted Banach, who won the 1988 Beverly Hills 
Theatre Guild-Julie Harris Playwright Award for the work. "It intrigued me, so 
I read a bunch of books, then started writing. Originally, it was a story about 
a disease. But over the two years it took to write, it turned into a love 
story. Disease is just the backdrop -- and a metaphor for fear and alienation 
in today's society." 
</P>
<P>
COME TO THE CABARET: "Kander and Ebb: A Tribute" is the theme of this year's 
AIDS Project L.A. benefit, Friday and Saturday at the Embassy Theatre in 
downtown Los Angeles. Performing will be, among others, Lucie Arnaz, Jane Carr, 
Patrick Cassidy, Carole Cook, Peter Frechette, Dale Kristien, Lu Leonard and 
Donna McKechnie. Tickets cost $10-$50. Information: (213) 962-1600. 
</P>
<P>
The Kander/Ebb repertoire includes "Cabaret," "Chicago," "Zorba," and "Flora, 
the Red Menace," a revival of which opens Feb. 11 at Pasadena Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
WEIRD WORSHIP: "We make fun of all kinds of worship, but especially celebrity 
worship," Bill Schreiner explained of the title of the Groundlings' newest 
revue, "Worship the Groundling You Walk On," opening Friday at the Groundling 
Theatre in West Hollywood. "I can't tell you everything we do," added the 
director. "There are some funny things that have to do with (the titular) 
'walking on' in the lobby." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a tried-and-true format offers 12-14 sketches and 2-3 improvs by a 
dozen performers. 
</P>
<P>
"We find the audience warms to the improv if they experience it early in the 
first act," noted Schreiner (director of the film "A Sinful Life."). "We're 
educating them how to play the game, be involved. So at the end of the evening, 
they've had their initial participation, they know the lay of the land -- and 
they're willing to be more adventurous. That's also true of the actors. The 
more you laugh, the more the stress goes away -- and the more willing you are 
to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Skits include "Barbies," (two women play out their doll fantasies), "Fishing" 
(for compliments) and "The Home-Surprise Shopping Network" (audience members 
contribute the items -- and the Groundlings have to sell them). 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Call it safe mikes. When Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Starlight 
Express" arrives at the Pantages Feb. 22, the baggage will include a full 
supply of condoms -- for the cast's microphones, of course. As 
skating-and-singing "trains," the two dozen-plus performers utilize cordless 
microphones (designed just for them), which extend from their helmets and curve 
around their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Condoms, according to a "Starlight" spokesman, are the most effective sheath 
for the delicate mikes off-duty. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: August Strindberg's "Dance with Death" is playing at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. Alan Mandell directs Mitchell Ryan and Marian Mercer as 
the battling marrieds Edgar and Alice, with H. Richard Greene as their old 
friend Kurt. 
</P>
<P>
Noted Sylvie Drake in The Times: "The moves are correct under Mandell's 
direction, but their calibration is off and the relationships labored. 
Connections often miss. . . . Only Ryan in the play's most powerful and complex 
role, succeeds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Orange County Register's Thomas O'Connor: "Instead of Sweden, this 
might be a desolate Irish coastal island, for the director has given the whole 
a deftly, darkly ironic style of playing, straight out of Samuel Beckett." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Polly Warfield in Drama-Logue: "Mandell mines the rich vein of quirky 
humor in Strindberg's play, he expresses its rhythms, strengths and subtleties 
and the justice of its contradictions. It emerges as the classic it is."

If you're not a girl in your low teens, this 50-minute tape probably won't 
interest you. 
</P>
<P>
But those in that target group will find plenty to l-o-v-e in this no-frills 
package. This white teen vocal group is so into piercing falsetto leads and so 
heavily influenced by such '60s and '70s R&amp;B vocal groups as the Stylistics 
that it's like watching five Bobby Brown wannabes. Sorely missing: interviews 
to provide insights into this pop phenomenon. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 GIPSY KINGS "MOSAIQUE" ELEKTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gipsy Kings' surprise U.S. success last year held a delicate balance 
between novelty and legitimate inter-cultural phenomenon: real French/Spanish 
Gypsies doing a modernized version of real Gypsy music in Andalusian Spanish. 
On its second U.S. release, the group wisely avoids playing up the novelty 
aspect. 
</P>
<P>
Save for a rather horrid version of "Volare" (apparently a sequel to last 
year's much better Gipsification of "My Way"), this is a pretty straight 
rendering of the sexy style the band has developed, with no obvious compromises 
or panderings to its new American audience. But as such, it's too much of a 
repeat of the U.S. debut. The arrangements are a little fuller, but don't 
really move in any new direction (and don't catch fire as the band can in 
concert). Only the Andalusian-rooted "Viento Del Arena" stands out as a new 
twist. For the rest of it, unfortunately, once may be enough. STEVE HOCHMAN

RECORD RACK: *** OFRA HAZA "DESERT WIND" SIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lovely, exotic Yemenite Hebrew wailing meets the cold, insistent 
thump-thump-thump of techno-disco. An unreleased Malcolm McLaren cross-cultural 
pastiche? It's certainly not that calculated, and moreover, Israeli singer Haza 
has all the international license she needs to mess with World Beat marriages, 
but her third American release does at times indeed have the slightly 
uncomfortable feel of one of McLaren's exercises in unwieldy musical matrimony 
-- it's a forced union, not a natural one. 
</P>
<P>
That said, "Desert Wind" still works well enough if you accept it on its own 
novelistic terms, which may or may not transcend time and further fine-tuning. 
About half the tracks work her decidedly non-Anglo phrasings and intonations 
into square-jawed English-language settings and sample-happy dance formats, but 
Haza offers up more traditional Yemenite folk fodder too; it's all tasteful, 
tuneful and nicely mysterious, if not yet fully or organically realized. 
</P>
<P>
In throbbing, bass-heavy "Inta" (as in "inta my heart"), the producers throw a 
little old-fashioned reverb on her typically "haunting" vocal mid-cut -- and, 
presto, it's as if there's sand on the dance floor and elbow room from here to 
the next lonely dune. CHRIS WILLMAN

RECORD RACK: * 1/2 ERASURE "WILD!" SIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUFF MARLOWE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British teen dance throbs Erasure made it big in America with such electro 
dance hits as "A Little Respect" and "Chains of Love." The group's two members 
looked good and the music was little more than another copy of the syrupy synth 
piddlings of Duran Duran and Depeche Mode (Erasure music man Vince Clarke was a 
Mode founder), but apparently it was plenty for their fans. 
</P>
<P>
On this latest effort Erasure downplays the giddy dance pop directions of their 
previous work and heads off in a more introspective vein, pulling down the 
tempo and waxing a bit more melancholy. For all the grand intentions of the 
more serious slant, the arrangements are simplistic and indulgent. Add some 
truly retarded lyrics and what we get is plain-wrap pop with fancy packaging.

Fordham is the VH-1 generation's latest politically correct but innocuous torch 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
(Her superfluous nod to the rain forests in the middle of a romantic ballad 
here is as much a non sequitur as last year's apartheid reference.) The 
sentimental writing on this sophomore effort is not without intelligent 
touches, yet the once-shunned, now-hep easy-listening approach virtually defies 
you to pay attention. "You treat my skin like porcelain," Fordham complains in 
the quietly weepy title song, but the woman doth protest too much: "Porcelain," 
the album, lives up to its title -- untouchably pretty and dull. Chris Willman

THE MOUSSE WARS: Who would guess you could actually hear anything exciting on 
"Hitline USA," one of those dreary syndicated radio call-in shows that 
spotlights a different rock star each week (it airs live here Sundays at 8 p.m. 
on Power 106). But everybody in the music biz has been hooting over the Jan. 14 
program. It was a sizzling pop prize fight, thanks to Richard Marx, who came 
out swinging at "Hitline" co-host Adam Curry, best known as the perfectly 
coiffed emcee of another snoozy show, MTV's "Top 20 Countdown." After hearing a 
tape of the broadcast, we score Marx the winner -- by a knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very self-critical," Marx said early on. "But I'm not nearly as critical 
of me as some other people -- like our co-host, Adam Curry." Marx proceeded to 
explain how he'd heard from friends that Curry had "insulted" him on MTV, 
making light of an incident where Marx trashed his tour bus after it was 
delayed at the Canadian border, nearly causing him to miss a concert date. 
Marx's friends said that Curry had reported the incident by joking: "Richard 
Marx trashing his bus -- that's like Doogie Howser going on a homicidal 
shooting spree." 
</P>
<P>
When Marx confronted Curry at an MTV taping, Curry denied making the remarks. 
But as Marx told "Hitline" listeners, he obtained a tape from MTV and "there 
(Adam) was, saying word for word what he'd been accused of." Marx then said, on 
the air: "So Adam, you lying scumbag! I don't want to hear your voice for the 
rest of this interview. . . . He's got a hairdo like Mrs. Howell from 
'Gilligan's Island!' " 
</P>
<P>
Curry tried to placate Marx by saying: "Hopefully, we can refrain from all the 
personal differences -- I don't think this is either the time or the place to 
discuss it. Although. . . ." Marx interrupted: "Adam, you jerk! I don't even 
want to hear your voice! You're just a mousse endorsement!" 
</P>
<P>
Since the two were separated by satellite technology -- Curry was in New York, 
Marx was in Los Angeles -- the rivals never came to blows. But the acid quips 
never stopped, culminating with Curry sneering at Marx: "Remember, I'm on MTV 
every single day -- and you're not." When the dust cleared, Marx had abruptly 
departed, without an apology from Curry. When we called Curry to hear his side 
of the story, his management said he wouldn't comment. But sources close to 
Curry insisted that he didn't invent the quip, saying he was simply reading 
from a script, which was presumably approved by MTV's brass.

POP EYE: SKID ROW'S SEBASTIAN BACH EMBROILED IN AIDS ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his Top 20 album past 3 million copies in sales, his video a regular 
winner of MTV's "Top 20 Countdown" and his face popping up on teen-age bedroom 
walls everywhere, Sebastian Bach is heavy-metal's hottest new sex symbol. But 
will his star be dimmed by a pair of recent incidents in which the headbanger 
poster-boy enraged AIDS activists and was arrested after hitting a fan in the 
face with a bottle during a concert? 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bach was criticized by AIDS activists after a heavy-metal fan mag 
ran a picture of the 21-year-old singer wearing a T-shirt with an insensitive 
AIDS-related, anti-gay epithet that cannot be printed in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Quizzed about the shirt by MTV last month, Skid Row's lead singer 
lightheartedly responded: "I understand it's not cool to make fun of death. I 
guess nobody gets my jokes. Anyway, a kid threw (the shirt) on stage, I put it 
on, and all these people got mad at me. But let me just state this -- I do not 
know, condone, comprehend or understand homosexuality in any way, shape, form 
or (laughs) size." 
</P>
<P>
This month, he's back in the news after MTV began airing footage from a Dec. 27 
Springfield, Mass., concert where the singer was struck by a bottle hurled from 
the audience. Enraged, he screamed obscenities and threw the bottle back into 
the crowd, hitting a 17-year-old girl in the face. Bach then leaped into the 
audience where, according to MTV's account, he landed on the girl and kicked 
another fan in the chin before being dragged back on stage by his roadies. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested after the show, Bach was charged with two counts of assault and 
battery, two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of mayhem. 
After pleading innocent in the Hampden County Hall of Justice, he was freed on 
$10,000 bail with a trial date set for May 15. The injured girl was treated for 
"severe facial cuts and bruises." 
</P>
<P>
Bach, who is back on tour with Skid Row, has refused any comment. His band's 
manager, Scott McGhee, also refused to comment on the charges (though he 
acknowledged that MTV gave an accurate account of the incident). Asked if Bach 
had apologized to the girl, McGhee would only say: "Sebastian hasn't talked 
with her yet. But he feels very badly and wants to see that she is taken care 
of. He'd like to meet her and make sure she's all right." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee would not discuss a more pressing question: What is the possible impact 
of these incidents on Bach's career? We asked a pair of top rock managers for 
their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know what it feels like to be a Frank Sinatra fan," said Danny Goldberg, 
Belinda Carlisle's manager. "I thought Skid Row's '18 and Life' was a terrific 
song, but I could never condone Sebastian's bigoted, anti-gay remarks. People 
are entitled to make a mistake. But I couldn't represent anyone who consciously 
expressed reprehensible attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
"It might hurt the band's reputation with Tracy Chapman fans," said another 
manager, who insisted on anonymity. "But I doubt if it's going to hurt him with 
Skid Row fans. They'll probably say, 'I dig where he's coming from -- but it's 
a shame he hit the girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
One rock fan who's incensed by Bach's behavior is Donovan Leitch, the young 
actor and writer (and yes, son of Donovan). He and his pal, David Kaufman, have 
organized a letter-writing campaign to MTV, decrying the video channel's 
"direct or indirect support" of any group associated with discrimination, 
bigotry or violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends who are sick and dying of AIDS and I think Sebastian Bach, 
who's a pop idol with impressionable young fans, should take some flak from 
this," said Leitch who has a small role in "Glory." It just seems that if MTV 
is airing his video all the time, they should take a stand on this." 
</P>
<P>
His letter, which he and Kaufman are circulating in the pop community, suggests 
that instead of banning the video, MTV could air public-service announcements 
preceding the clip, which could "help counteract Mr. Bach's public 
disservices." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Herzog, MTV's senior vice president in charge of programming, said MTV 
strictly keeps its news coverage separate from its video programming. "We've 
never stepped away from a story, whether it's controversial remarks by Bach, 
members of Public Enemy, Guns N' Roses or Andrew Dice Clay," he said. "Our news 
department has always done a good job of questioning these artists about their 
points of view. But we haven't taken Skid Row's videos off the air anymore than 
we would take Public Enemy's videos off the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a difficult situation. But should we stop playing James Brown's 
videos because he's in jail? Or Bruce Springsteen's videos because he's left 
his wife? 
</P>
<P>
"Sebastian Bach is still hot -- he's playing music our audience wants to hear. 
We're not going to protect him -- after all, we broke this story. But as long 
as the public wants to see Skid Row videos, we have the responsibility to give 
them what they want to see."

SAFE CARRIBEAN HOME: Apparently legendary Beatles producer George Martin still 
has plenty of clout in pop land. Sickened by the devastation Hurricane Hugo 
brought to the tiny island of Montserrat last September, Martin (who frequently 
records at AIR Studios there) persuaded nearly 20 pop stars to donate tracks to 
a just-released benefit album, "After the Hurricane: Songs for Montserrat." 
</P>
<P>
Released by Chrysalis Records, the compilation features material from the 
Rolling Stones, Elton John, Luther Vandross, Dire Straits, Simply Red, Cheap 
Trick, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. All profits from the album will go to 
the Montserrat Hurricane Relief Record Fund. . . . Joan Jett has always had a 
way with oldies -- remember her crunchin' version of "Crimson and Clover?" So 
it's hardly a surprise that her just-released new album is entirely given over 
to reinterpretations of rock classics. Titled "The Hit List," it features the 
Sex Pistols' "Pretty Vacant," Jimi Hendrix's "Up From the Skies," AC/DC's 
"Dirty Deeds," the Chambers Brothers' "Time Has Come Today" and the Kinks' 
"Celluloid Heroes," which even features some vocal help from its author, Ray 
Davies. . . . And remember the Unforgiven, the club faves who were a

EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY GALLERY ON LA BREA DISPLAYS AND SELLS ART FROM 
CONTEMPORARY CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The originals of world-famous contemporary art -- paintings that have been 
reproduced thousands, even hundreds of thousands of times -- are hanging on the 
walls of a new gallery on La Brea. Unless you have children, you probably have 
never seen them. 
</P>
<P>
The Every Picture Tells A Story gallery deals exclusively in art from 
contemporary children's books. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids come in here it's amazing for them to see something like King 
Bidgood in the original," said Lois Sarkisian, 32, co-owner of the gallery that 
opened Oct. 29. Hanging near her is "Today We Lunch in the Tub," a whimsical 
work by painter Don King of jolly King Bidgood enjoying an enormous lunch while 
taking a bath. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are in awe when they see it," she said. "It's like us seeing a van 
Gogh for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
"One nice thing about this business," said co-owner Abbie Phillips, 36, with a 
laugh, "is that when you go home at night you have no trouble talking to the 
kids about work." 
</P>
<P>
As much as children might like Every Picture Tells A Story, the setting is very 
adult. The art is hung tastefully on white walls and illuminated by track 
lighting. The floor space is open and the furnishings minimal. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like almost every other gallery in the La Brea/Melrose area, except 
that the content of the paintings are dancing dogs, frolicking ants, menacing 
wizards and idealized scenes from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We very much wanted this gallery to be in a fine art area," Sarkisian said, 
"because we believe this is fine art. We didn't want it to be cute, we didn't 
want it to be childlike in any way." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery exists, however, because three years ago Phillips had a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trained as a biologist, but after my first child was born I became more 
interested in children's books," she said. "I always loved the books, I loved 
to teach about them." 
</P>
<P>
Turning her love of the books into a part-time profession, she began to speak 
to groups about children's books. "I gave talks to parents, teachers, divorced 
fathers, peace groups, that sort of thing. I would tell them about the ones I 
liked and why." After the talk she would sell the books, which she had bought 
at wholesale prices. "It was sort of the Tupperware idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her timing was good. Before the 1980s, children's books were a backwater for 
the big publishers. The most popular books had longevity in the marketplace, 
but the sales figures were comparatively small and they were slow to realize a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
All that changed with the baby boom, the increase in two-income families and 
greater attention from publishers on the marketing of children's books. Higher 
prices did not 
</P>
<P>
prove to be an obstacle -- Chris Van Allsburg's "The Polar Express" has sold 
more than a million copies since it was introduced in 1984, despite its $16.95 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips noticed that customers were responding as much to the quality of the 
books' art as their texts. "People were saying they would love to have an 
original piece of art from them in their homes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She discussed it with Sarkisian, who was an interior designer when they met 
through a mutual friend two years ago. They formed a partnership to continue 
Phillips' book business while they began to contact children's book 
illustrators, usually through publishers, to see if they could represent the 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the artists had never been previously contacted by art dealers about 
selling their work. "It was a surprise," said Lambert Davis, a La Jolla painter 
who uses water-based acrylics to make warm, realistic images. He has 
illustrated "Jolly Mon," a book written by songwriter Jimmy Buffet and "The 
Bells of Christmas," a story by Virginia Hamilton about a black family at the 
turn of the century. "I had sold a couple of the paintings myself, but when 
they called it was the first time I had been approached to sell in a gallery." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips and Sarkisian had their first show in November, 1988, at the Alexander 
Gallery in Studio City, which included the paintings of Van Allsburg, the 
reigning king of children's book illustrators. "It would be hard to have a show 
without Van Allsburg's work in it," Sarkisian said. "When people think about 
serious art for children's books, they think of him." 
</P>
<P>
His "Polar Express" was so popular that it gave the field new respect -- his 
work was seriously profiled in numerous magazines -- and brought it into new 
realms on the financial front. For his most recent book, a version of "Swan 
Lake," he and writer Mark Helprin split an advance of $801,000, a previously 
unheard of amount for a children's book. 
</P>
<P>
The first show was a success, and Phillips and Sarkisian went on to sponsor 
exhibits in several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We proved that the response for the artwork was there," Sarkisian said. "We 
eventually felt the business had grown to the point where we could have a 
gallery of our own." 
</P>
<P>
"The art needed a home," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Every Picture Tells a Story opened with a show of paintings by Barry Moser. "I 
think he is a pre-eminent watercolorist," Sarkisian said. "And the subject 
matter is familiar." Moser has most recently illustrated several sets of Uncle 
Remus stories in books called "Jump," "Jump Again" and "Jump On Over" with 
texts by Van Dyke Parks, based on the Joel Chandler Harris originals. He has 
also illustrated editions of "Tom Sawyer" and "Alice in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
The current show at the gallery centers on Richard Jessie Watson's egg tempera 
paintings used in his retelling of "Tom Thumb," set in medieval times. The show 
also includes paintings by Davis from "The Bells of Christmas"; black and white 
etchings by Arthur Geisart from "The Ark" and "Pigs From A To Z"; classic 
storybook-style paintings by Michael Hague from an edition of "The Wizard of 
Oz"; watercolors by Ted Rand for Edward Lear's classic nonsense poem "The 
Jumblies"; and paintings from Van Allsburg's "Two Bad Ants," in which the 
painter shows household scenes from an ant's viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The prices for the artwork are anything but childlike. The center-spread 
painting from Watson's "Tom Thumb" is $7,000. Van Allsburg's "Two Bad Ants" 
paintings range in price from $5,500 to $6,400. Paintings from "Under the 
Sunday Tree" by Amos Ferguson, a 90-year-old artist who works in a primitive 
style, sell for $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We set the prices in consultation with the artist," Sarkisian said. Most of 
the paintings in the gallery sell for about $1,000, with etchings and working 
drawings generally going for less. The least expensive piece now in the gallery 
is a small Geisart etching for $75. 
</P>
<P>
"The price has to do with whether their books have been bestsellers," she said. 
"And awards are a factor." 
</P>
<P>
The most prestigious award in children's book illustration is the annual 
Caldecott Medal (Van Allsburg has won two.) But others are important. Sarkisian 
said that Richard Watson's prices are higher than some partly because his first 
book, "Bronwen the Traw and the Shape-Shister," with text by James Dickey, won 
the Parents' Choice Award. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the work is important too, of course," she said. "There was an 
incredible reaction to 'Tom Thumb' as soon as it came out. It is a very popular 
book. It's beautiful and has an emotional content." 
</P>
<P>
Buyers seem to agree. As of last week, 11 of the 20 Watson paintings on 
display, including the $7,000 center spread from "Tom Thumb," were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sarkisian said that in the first two months of business they sold about 
$220,000 worth of artwork at the gallery, far beyond their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been surprised a bit by who is buying," Sarkisian said. "We expected 
people with a lot of expendable income and people looking for a bargain in art 
for investment purposes. But we are also getting a lot of teachers, parents 
with children, young single people who just fall in love with the art and are 
willing to save their dollars until they can buy a piece. 
</P>
<P>
"We are getting more emotionally based purchases than I would have expected, 
and that is just great as far as I am concerned." 
</P>
<P>
She said that people who did buy for investment purposes are already reaping 
the rewards, however. "We sold one of the King Bidgood paintings for $3,000. 
Now we have a list of people who want to be notified if the buyer is willing to 
sell. They are offering double what he paid just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the artists called to thank us for starting the gallery. 'Just by 
opening your door you raised my prices 50%,' he said. I think that by putting 
this art in a gallery setting, it gives them the attention and respect they 
deserve."

<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you John Henken, Barbara Isenberg, Don Shirley, Sylvie Drake, Daniel 
Cariaga, Lewis Segal and Jan Breslauer for lopping off four decades from my 
life, making me enter the new decade 40 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
If all of you could scare up only one female in "Faces for the Nineties," we 
are indeed in the 1950s again. 
</P>
<P>
Gosh, Lewis Segal, it's nice that you were able to dig up Judy Mitoma and drag 
her out of that cave where she and all the other women in the arts were hiding, 
when your colleagues were searching out those bright pusses to adorn the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ten to one. Great. Really. Time stands still for The Times.

MORRISON'S LEGACY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Oliver Stone is making a movie about Morrison (or anything else), he should 
pay more attention to historical detail in his sound track. 
</P>
<P>
In Stone's current film, "Born on the Fourth of July," Don McLean's "American 
Pie" was played as background music while the film covered the 1968-69 era. 
"American Pie" wasn't even released until 1971!

MORRISON'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has happened to Calendar? It used to be full of one-or-two-page articles 
about interesting people doing interesting things. It now reads endlessly of 
wastrels whose lives, by their hedonistic self-destructive behavior, offer 
little or nothing of benefit to society and are best ignored or forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example is "Jim Morrison: Back to the Sixties, Darkly" by Pat H. 
Broeske, Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
I resent seven pages wasted on this erratic downbeat loser whose baseness 
destroyed his life by age 27, when there are so many worthwhile people doing 
great things who could use an encouraging accolade, particularly at a time when 
we are trying to rise above the chaos and decadence of the '60s. Fie on 
director Oliver Stone and his movie.

Re "Dancing the 'Naked Tango' " (Jan. 7): 
</P>
<P>
Lines in John M. Wilson's article such as ". . . the abuse and degradation of 
some women characters is unrelenting . . ." and ". . . Cholo pushes her to the 
edge with him, hoping to influence her cold spirit and meld their souls" reveal 
all too clearly the mean-spirited little-boy fantasy of how women ought to 
respond to cruelty and that little-boy need to control. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly, the end ("inflaming her cold spirit") will justify the means, as 
brutal as director Leonard Schrader feels they must be. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader's savage story seems to say that the man must give the woman not what 
she thinks she wants (i.e., to be treated decently) but what she really needs 
(i.e., to be degraded) in order to "experience passion." 
</P>
<P>
This idea, that brutality can somehow equal love, is the very lie that 
threatens to destroy the women of this nation.

THE HALL OF FAME GAME: JUST WHO WILL ROCK 'N' ROLL TO GLORY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning "This Year's Hall of Famers" by Don Waller: 
</P>
<P>
The song used in the bar scene of "The Deer Hunter" is "Can't Take My Eyes Off 
You," not "My Eyes Adored You." 
</P>
<P>
And Waller is wrong in saying it's a Four Seasons record; both the songs were 
solo singles by Frankie Valli. 
</P>
<P>
The "Deer Hunter" guys sing "I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right, I 
need you, baby. . . ." Whereas "My Eyes Adored You" deals with young, young 
love and wouldn't play well with drunk steel workers shooting pool. Unless they 
were supposed to use the cues to smash the jukebox.

My respect for the veracity of The Times compels me to reveal an item from my 
own hippie past -- namely having been a journalist who discussed Jim Morrison 
on the record with his father, Rear Adm. 
</P>
<P>
George W. Morrisson. The interview occurred in the Pentagon in May, 1968, and a 
portion of it was published in the April, 1969, issue of Crawdaddy magazine in 
my article "The Morrison Mirage." 
</P>
<P>
This would appear to contradict Broeske's comment, in what was otherwise an 
informative article, that Morrison's parents "have never spoken publicly about 
their son."

"AWARD-WINNING Films of the Silver Screen" is a program for film buffs, Trivial 
Pursuit fans and students of popular culture. It lists movie titles 
alphabetically -- by year and by Academy Awards won in 31 categories. 
</P>
<P>
It displays a profile of each film and shows which movies won the most awards 
(there have only been four films since 1927 to win more than eight Oscars: 
"Gigi" in 1958, "Ben-Hur" in 1959, "West Side Story" in 1961 and "The Last 
Emperor" in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
If you ask it for all Oscar-winning films beginning with the letter "P" from 
1927 to 1988 (the last year currently in the data base), it gives you a list 
that includes "The Paper Chase," "Paper Moon," "A Passage to India," "Patton," 
"Phantom of the Opera," "Pillow Talk" and "Platoon." If you ask it for the last 
10 winners for Best Picture, it gives you "Kramer vs. Kramer," "Ordinary 
People," "Chariots of Fire," "Gandhi," "Terms of Endearment," "Amadeus," "Out 
of Africa," "Platoon," "The Last Emperor" and "Rainman." 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing fancy here, just lots of information and lots of ways to look 
at it. With every film, the program tells you who were the stars, what awards 
it won and what movies it beat to win the awards. (If you look up "Midnight 
Express," for example, you'll see that it won the Best Music and Best Writing 
categories for 1978. Principal cast members were Brad Davis, Randy Quaid and 
John Hurt. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, beating out Neil Simon for 
"California Suite" and Warren Beatty and Elaine May for "Heaven Can Wait.")

THERE'S NOTHING MORE intriguing than losing oneself in the detailed and tiny 
world of a dollhouse. Shops that specialize in miniatures carry dollhouses and 
furnishings tailored to both children and serious collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Houses, which come in a variety of architectural styles -- including Colonial, 
Tudor and Victorian (the most popular) -- can be purchased already assembled or 
as kits. Prices for kits suitable for children (including the basic exterior 
shell) begin at about $75. Most shops that sell kits will assemble them for a 
fee. Dollhouses are typically about 24 by 18 inches by 30 inches high and are 
all built to the same conventional scale of 1 inch equals 1 foot. 
</P>
<P>
Dollhouse interiors are purposely unfinished -- much of the fun is in 
decorating. "Even the youngest children have definite taste about the basics," 
says Wally Hage of The Dollhouse Lady in San Gabriel. "By the time kids are 9 
or 10 they can be quite sophisticated in their selection of furnishings." If 
elegant trappings such as a Lilliputian Persian carpet or a truly baby grand 
piano are avoided, an average six room dollhouse can be completed for about 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollhouses and miniatures are available at The Dollhouse Lady, 8964 Huntington 
Drive, San Gabriel; Doll &amp; Miniature Shoppe, 661 S. La Brea Ave., Los 
Angeles; Accent on Miniatures, 23011 Moulton Parkway, Laguna Hills; Mini-Casas,

ARMY FIRES ON CROWD IN AZERBAIJAN; 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Soviet army troops opened fire on Azerbaijani militants on the streets of the 
republic's capital of Baku early Saturday, using tanks to break through human 
blockades and killing and wounding many, Azerbaijani activists said. 
</P>
<P>
"They simply opened fire at will, with no warning shots," Leila Unsova, a 
spokeswoman for the Azerbaijani Popular Front, said in a telephone interview 
from Baku. "At least 13 are dead so far, but we expect more. Our doctors have 
been told not to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports of casualties were extremely sketchy, with figures ranging from 
two deaths to 500. But the shooting seemed certain to further inflame passions 
resulting from the current ethnic conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
which began last weekend. It marked the Kremlin's first use of deadly force 
against the Soviet people since army troops killed 20 pro-independence 
demonstrators during a protest last April 9 in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Unsova said the shooting started shortly after midnight at the blockades at the 
northern edge of Baku and then moved into the city center. About 25,000 to 
30,000 people were still on the streets when the firing began, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are very angry. This will not end things. There simply will be more 
bloodshed," Unsova declared. 
</P>
<P>
Another Popular Front spokesman, Mahmoud Kesamanly, said the Soviet troops 
"pushed right through the blockades with tanks. But people started resisting 
right away. There are many dead and injured." 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic and sometimes heavy gunfire continued at least until dawn Saturday, 
witnesses in Baku reported. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Soviet sources have cited the strong negative reaction to last 
year's killings in Tbilisi as a key factor in Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's restraint until Saturday in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian incident has posed significant political problems for Gorbachev 
ever since. As recently as last month in the Congress of People's Deputies, 
representatives from Tbilisi, still angry at Gorbachev over the deaths, walked 
out. The president personally ran out into the hall and appealed to them not to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation early Saturday came after a day in which Azerbaijani 
militants ruled the streets of Baku, trapping some Red Army troops in their 
barracks, blocking others from patrolling the city and vowing to set up an 
Islamic republic, according to reports from the area. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 1.8 million was in a state of virtual anarchy during the day 
Friday, with most factories closed and thousands of people milling around 
outdoor bonfires, according to official media and a spokesman at the 
Azerbaijani republic mission in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
For several hours, the Baku activists had appeared poised for a confrontation 
with Soviet troops, who were waiting for an order to disperse the crowd. The 
Azerbaijanis had vowed that they would not abandon their blockades, creating a 
powder-keg situation. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Kremlin announced that it was sending in more soldiers, but gave 
no figures. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged that after a week of 
fighting and despite the deployment of about 24,000 troops in the region, the 
situation had not improved and had worsened in some places. 
</P>
<P>
"We must take tough measures," Gen. Alexei Lizichev, chief of the army's 
political section, declared on the evening news program Vremya. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally broadcast statement, the Soviet government had appeared to hint 
that the army was preparing to strike. It warned that the violence would be 
stopped "at all costs," for "today's tragedy may turn into tomorrow's national 
catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
The news agency Tass said Azerbaijani nationalists attacked the Armenian border 
village of Yeraskh, killing three Armenians and wounding four others. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians struck back at the Azerbaijani village of Tadan, according to press 
reports, swooping in aboard stolen helicopters and in an armored personnel 
carrier. They reportedly drove many Azerbaijanis from the village. 
</P>
<P>
In a report from Tadan, the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya quoted villages as saying 
they had lost faith in Moscow to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Will the Soviet power ever be able to protect us again?" one villager was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Popular frustration is mounting over what is perceived as Moscow's slowness in 
dealing with the crisis. Demands were made for the Kremlin to act quickly and 
toughly to impose law and order in the area, where about 200 people have been 
killed in clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry reported 72 fatalities in the last week, together with 
220 wounded. These figures are believed to cover casualties in Baku for the 
most part. Once the dead are tallied in other areas, the toll is expected to be 
much higher. 
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku in the last week. A 
group of 240 Armenians on a plane that arrived Friday night from Baku refused 
to disembark until the Kremlin promised to ensure their safety and provide food 
and housing. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of violence was sparked by a recent incident in Baku, but the 
underlying cause is festering tension over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of 
largely Christian Armenians in the mostly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan. 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis alike claim the region on historical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days the most serious fighting has taken place in cities and towns in 
Azerbaijan, according to reports from the area. But the official news agency 
Tass reported Friday that "militants are being massed around Nagorno-Karabakh," 
where because of sabotage a third of the people in the region's capital were 
without water and several blocks were without heat. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists have been admitted to Armenia, but they are not allowed to 
enter Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
In Baku, about 10,000 Azerbaijanis paraded through the streets Thursday 
chanting, "Azadlyg," or freedom, according to a report in the daily 
Komsomolskaya Pravda. The marchers trapped Soviet troops in their barracks, the 
newspaper said, and "blocked all approaches leading to Baku with people, buses 
and trucks." 
</P>
<P>
It said: "The situation in the city heats up literally by the hour. If the 
masses do not calm down, it could soon lead to unpredictable events." 
</P>
<P>
The daily Izvestia reported that troops at the edge of the city fired warning 
shots early Friday to extricate themselves from an angry crowd. There were no 
casualties then, it said. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports from nationalists in Armenia, supported by news reports on 
television, Soviet soldiers at the port in Baku were continuing to help with 
the evacuation of Armenians. At the same time, tens of thousands of 
Azerbaijanis reportedly rallied in front of the republic's Communist Party 
headquarters and demanded that the Soviet troops be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The crowds in Baku also reportedly called for the republic's government to 
resign and for Soviet authority to be overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Baku was said to be paralyzed by protest strikes, with motor traffic 
halted and no newspapers being published. According to a television news 
report, the crowds blocking the streets to prevent Soviet army patrols vowed 
earlier Friday to continue the action through the night. It said civilian 
vigilante patrols were performing neighborhood police duties. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if Azerbaijan is under a state of emergency, Armenia should be 
too," a spokesman at the Armenian mission in Moscow told a reporter. "That is 
why our people are expressing so much discontent." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing a conference at the Kremlin, said the fighting served the 
interests of "extremists, irresponsible adventurists and representatives of the 
shadow economy," or black market. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika is a bone in their throat," he said, referring to his program of 
social and economic reform. "But they can't oppose it directly, so they clutch 
at tension on an ethnic basis. In Azerbaijan, forces have already appeared that 
are pressing for the republic's secession from the Soviet Union, for an Islamic 
Azerbaijan. But this finds no support among the people."

PENDRAGON CASTLE: KING ARTHUR'S BIRTHPLACE OR MERE FADED RUIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ruined castle in wind-swept northern England may mark the birthplace of King 
Arthur, its owner believes. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Raven Frankland has spent almost 30 years painstakingly restoring 
Pendragon Castle since buying it at auction for a bargain price in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the tangle of fact and myth surrounding Arthur, he believes Pendragon's 
claim to the legend is as strong as anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the legendary home of Uther Pendragon, father of King Arthur," Frankland 
said. "I think it's the only place that claims to be the residence of Arthur's 
father." 
</P>
<P>
Sheep graze on the banks of the River Eden beside the ruined walls of 
present-day Pendragon, set in the shadow of steep hills in the northern county 
of Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>
The remains date from around 1170, when a Norman castle was built on the spot. 
But Frankland believes the artificial mound on which it stands dates from Roman 
times, when it may have served as a signal station. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the ancient British King Uther Pendragon may have built his own 
wooden residence on the existing mound after the Romans withdrew from Britain 
in the 5th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Hard evidence of an Arthurian connection is scarce. But the fact that the 
Norman castle retained the name Pendragon bears witness to the strength of the 
legend, as does the local folklore associated with the castle. 
</P>
<P>
One local rhyme, first recorded in the 17th Century, suggests that Uther may 
have tried unsuccessfully to divert the nearby River Eden to flow into the 
castle moat: 
</P>
<P>
Let Uther Pendragon do what he can, 
</P>
<P>
Eden will run where Eden ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars have worked for centuries to unscramble fact from fiction and uncover 
the truth about King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table. Many places, 
especially in Cornwall and other parts of southwest England, claim links with 
his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
"Arthur may well have been a general who fought successful battles against the 
invading Saxons from the east all the way up and down the western side of the 
country," Frankland said. 
</P>
<P>
Two American scholars last year pinpointed a site near Stirling in central 
Scotland as the probable site for Arthur's Round Table, which they claimed was 
not in fact a table but a circular meeting hall used by the king and his 
knights. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Americans, Norma Goodrich, agreed that Pendragon Castle seems a 
plausible location for Arthur's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Arthur really was born right around northern England or within a very short 
distance of Hadrian's Wall and Carlisle," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodrich said the name Pendragon refers to a banner designed by the magician 
Merlin and carried by Uther into battle. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a banner in the shape of a dragon. It was a long pennant and had a 
tail of fire so that the man who fought under the banner was called the dragon 
-- the man you'd better be scared of. It means head dragon, commander." 
</P>
<P>
Uther died in battle against the Saxons when Arthur was still a boy, according 
to one version of the legend. The future king was brought up by Merlin until he 
proved his royal blood by drawing the now-famous sword Excalibur from a stone 
anvil and was elected king at the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
Frankland, a farmer and local councilor who works on the castle in his spare 
time, is used to journalists' questions about the chances of unearthing 
Arthur's famous sword or other finds that would substantiate the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances are extremely slim but, of course, it doesn't do to say that 
they're nil. It would only be if something of precious metal or bronze were to 
be lost . . . timber, leather, iron all disappear, especially in this wet 
climate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frankland, whose father was a passionate Arthurian enthusiast, jumped at the 
chance to buy Pendragon when it was put up for auction in 1963. He paid just 
$860 for it. 
</P>
<P>
The castle is closed to the public, but scholars and historians visit 
regularly, as do less welcome guests. 
</P>
<P>
"We were worried by the fact that the tourist authorities put out a statement 
that there was a secret room with buried treasure, which of course is absolute 
nonsense, and we did find that in the unopened vault somebody had been 
quarrying away the wall to try to get in," Frankland said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman barrel vaults, stone arches and large portions of the walls still stand, 
despite centuries of plundering when the castle was used as a source of stone 
for local buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Spiral staircases on either side of the main entrance are among its more 
unusual features. 
</P>
<P>
To Frankland, the architecture and the medieval history of the castle -- its 
first occupant was a Norman knight who took part in the murder of Archbishop of 
Canterbury Thomas Becket -- are more interesting than any connection with King 
Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a tremendous Arthurian fan myself," he said. "It wouldn't upset me 
terribly if I heard it was all bunk."

JUSTICE DEPT. LOOKS TO PRIVATE SECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: THE BID TO 'CONTRACT OUT' JOBS IS SEEN AS A COST-CUTTING MOVE BY 
SOME. CRITICS SAY THE DUTIES ARE 'INHERENTLY GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS.'

Can some Justice Department operations be turned over to private industry? 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of many department employees, the idea is unworkable -- the 
brainchild of short-sighted budget cutters and free-market zealots left over 
from the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But to the Office of Management and Budget, and apparently some Justice 
managers, the move may be long overdue. This month, responding to a 
longstanding OMB directive, the department announced that it may look for 
private contractors to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in anti-drug, 
child abuse and other programs managed by two agencies in the Office of Justice 
Programs -- the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The bid to "contract out" these programs would eliminate the jobs of 48 program 
managers and other social scientists -- or more than 60% of the career 
positions in the two agencies. These managers oversee and evaluate federal 
grants that sponsor community anti-drug workshops, train police to cope with 
child abuse cases, run "neighborhood watch" anti-crime programs and scores of 
other locally oriented criminal justice efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all a farce," charged Stu Smith, president of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 2830, which represents the 
employees in the Office of Justice Programs. "These people are not giving 
haircuts . . . or making widgets. These are all inherently government 
functions." 
</P>
<P>
Velva Walter, spokeswoman for the Office of Justice Programs, said that is 
precisely what the department wants to find out. Under current OMB policy, 
departments must constantly review the work force to determine what positions 
can be more efficiently performed by the private sector. "It was determined 
that the social scientist positions constituted the single largest function 
capable of being contracted out," Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter also said that no final decisions have been made. "We are just doing 
what is required by OMB . . . to perform a study," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith argued that the department clearly tipped its hand by running a 
notice in Commerce Business Daily soliciting a private contractor to determine 
"the availability of commercial sources" for providing services to the Office 
of Justice Programs. 
</P>
<P>
The flap over the social scientists is the latest in a long-running debate over 
the wisdom of "privatizing" government services. Free-market conservatives have 
always favored the idea, arguing that private companies interested in 
maximizing profits are generally more efficient and productive than bureaucrats 
insulated from the rigors of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, OMB officials contend they have saved millions of dollars in recent 
years by contracting out such services as the manicuring of lawns at the Coast 
Guard or custodial services at the Army Corps of Engineers. But some academic 
experts are skeptical. They argue that competition is the only sure guarantee 
of cost-saving, and that substituting a private monopoly for a government 
agency may produce just as much waste and abuse, as the Pentagon procurement 
scandals of a few years ago demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not obvious that if you give a person a private monopoly that they can be 
more efficient than the government," said Clifford Winston, senior fellow at 
the Brookings Institution and a specialist in government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has been further complicated at the Justice Department, which until 
now has argued that, given the nature of its duties, the department ought to be 
immune from privatization altogether. Last year, for example, OMB moved in on 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, identifying 640 positions that should be 
studied for privatization, including finger-printers, data transcribers and 
computer programmers. Justice officials -- backed by key allies on Capitol Hill 
-- fought back hard. Turning over sensitive bureau jobs to outside contractors 
could compromise foreign counterintelligence investigations and threaten the 
security of FBI crime computers, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, OMB backed down on the FBI. But the war is far from over. OMB 
recently pushed Justice to study 1,981 positions for contracting out over the 
next four years. Ironically, even though OMB generally favors as many 
privatization studies as possible, the Office of Justice Programs social 
scientists were not even on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like something that Justice is doing on their own," said an OMB 
spokeswoman.

GREECE'S NEW 'SEA WOLVES' OPT FOR PRACTICALITY OVER GLAMOUR; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPPING: DESPITE THE FLASHY LEGACY OF ONASSIS AND NIARCHOS, TODAY'S TYCOONS 
ARE MAKING THEIR FORTUNES WITH CAUTION AND COMPUTER SENSE.

PIRAEUS, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were the Golden Greeks, fiercely independent men who controlled the 
world's shipping, built lush island paradises and married society's most 
glamorous women. 
</P>
<P>
Aristotle Onassis, Stavros Niarchos and their contemporaries are still revered 
in Piraeus, base of the powerful Greek shipping industry. But today a new 
tycoon is succeeding them: the young businessman who shuns publicity and knows 
computers as well as compasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, a shipowner was treated like a god," said Diamantis 
Diamantides, who controls 25 ships. "Now he's a simple person." 
</P>
<P>
The Greek shipping tradition is thousands of years old, a product of the 
country's entrepreneurial talent and its kinship with the sea, which is within 
50 miles of almost any part of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of the Greek tycoon began earlier this century with the "sea 
wolves," sea captains who acquired fleets. It reached its personification in 
Niarchos and Onassis, volatile, dynamic magnates with business savvy and a 
gambler's touch, whose lives and loves were chronicled on the front pages of 
the world press. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the newer managers have maintained their predecessors' passion for the 
sea and their strong preference for family-run firms. But they are increasingly 
making longer-term investments, imposing modern business practices and buying 
newer, high-tech ships. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tending toward structured companies in corporate form as opposed to 
personality-driven, Onassis-type companies," said Emmanuel A. Vordonis, 
director of Thenamaris Ships Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Greeks owned the world's largest merchant fleet. The Japanese 
are now No. 1, but Greece is close behind, with 82 million tons of 
cargo-carrying capacity, according to the authoritative shipping magazine 
Naftiliaki. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the change of style in owning Greek ships is due to the crisis that hit 
the industry from 1975 to 1987, stemming from overbuilding of ships and 
competitive freight-rate cutting at a time of stagnating world trade. This 
bustling port near Athens is still haunted by memories of proud shipowners 
losing their vessels to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Diamantides, 42, who began buying ships in 1975 after working in shipping 
offices, says old-time magnates could get bank loans on the strength of their 
names. 
</P>
<P>
"Now you have to convince them with your figures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Business practices also have changed with the infusion of a different kind of 
shipowner -- either entrepreneurs from industry or construction attracted by a 
potential fortune, or the children of traditional shipowners, who have received 
advanced degrees in business or engineering at British or American 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"The new generation of managers has a different investment approach," said 
Dimitri Krondiras, the local director of Citibank, the major lender for Greek 
ship purchases. "This new generation perceives that investment in shipping is 
high-risk." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that gamble, some shipowners have diversified into oil, banking or 
hotel chains. Others are trying to cater more to the changing market, 
purchasing newer, more customized ships. 
</P>
<P>
A few shipowners are even beginning to raise money by opening their companies 
to outside investment and floating shares on the stock market -- previously "a 
kind of heresy in Greek ship owning," says George Anastassopoulos, the former 
head of the Transport Commission in the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
One example of the new Greek tycoon is Thanasis Martinos, whose family founded 
Thenamaris. Hailed as the "Mozart of shipping" for his precociousness, Martinos 
entered the business as a teen-ager when his mother and her brothers -- a 
shipping lawyer and a sea captain -- bought their first ship. 
</P>
<P>
Martinos worked with the firm while studying economics in London. Now 40, he 
and his two brothers head Thenamaris, which runs 55 ships itself and manages 
about 20 for other people. 
</P>
<P>
Vordonis, the director of the firm, says the older generation "had the risk 
approach, the hard-work approach, the entrepreneurial approach to bringing 
resources together that were difficult to bring together." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, shipowners rely on high-speed information relayed by computers, 
tight cost control and a team approach. 
</P>
<P>
Where old-style magnates used to make most decisions, sometimes screaming down 
cowering subordinates, the modern entrepreneurs are trying to attract and rely 
on technical experts to keep up with a fast-moving, efficient, more high-tech 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve, you need technology, modern management techniques," 
Vordonis says. "You go into how to manage people." 
</P>
<P>
A glance at the Thenamaris offices illustrates the change. Unlike the 
traditional rough-and-tumble offices tucked along the Piraeus waterfront, 
Thenamaris is a gleaming, glass-and-concrete ring in a lush coastal suburb. 
Sunlight pours into an airy core; water trickles through leafy plants in a 
central atrium. 
</P>
<P>
"We have round tables, where everyone feels equal. We tried to make it as 
friendly as possible," Vordonis says. "In addition to achieving efficiency, you 
must have people working in a high tone." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to keeping a lower profile at the office, the new tycoons avoid 
publicity in their private lives. Gone are the days when Niarchos and Onassis 
competed in the public eye, building ever-bigger yachts and purchasing islands 
they turned into paradises with imported trees and exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
Onassis dominated gossip columns through his affair with opera singer Maria 
Callas and later his marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, while Niarchos married, 
among others, Charlotte Ford, daughter of auto maker Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Today's shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in Athens' northern 
suburbs and vacation getaways on the Greek islands, as well as homes in London, 
Switzerland or Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
But they are content to stay out of the spotlight.

Winter had held Peggy in its dark grip every year since she was 11. She 
overslept, gorged on cookies and lost contact with friends. She couldn't 
concentrate. In school, her grades dropped. On the job, her work suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Then, quite literally, she saw the light. She has been doing fine ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy suffered extreme winter blues -- in medical terminology, seasonal 
affective disorder (SAD). Milder cases are known as S-SAD, for subsyndromal 
SAD. 
</P>
<P>
One in five Americans has some of the symptoms, Norman E. Rosenthal, a 
psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health in this Washington 
suburb, learned a few years ago in a study of the relationship of geographical 
latitudes and SAD. 
</P>
<P>
The farther north people live, the likelier they are to experience winter 
depression. In Sarasota, Fla., for example, the percentage afflicted was only 
8.9. In Nashua, N.H., at the other extreme, it was 30.2. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the last decade have Rosenthal and others been studying this pervasive 
but neglected condition. They presume that in the absence of sunlight some 
people develop abnormalities in certain brain chemicals, but they are still 
seeking details on how this process works. 
</P>
<P>
Their most important finding is what they see as a solution for most sufferers: 
bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
That is what cured Peggy, a native Midwesterner who later moved to New England. 
Hers is one of the case histories cited in Rosenthal's recently published book, 
"Seasons of the Mind: Why You Get the Winter Blues and What You Can Do About 
It." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal found that a few hours' daily exposure to a bank of fluorescent 
lights will, over a short period of time, pull as many as eight out of 10 SAD 
sufferers out of their depression. 
</P>
<P>
Before the light treatment -- phototherapy -- was discovered, many 
winter-depressed people thought they had a psychological problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognition that they're suffering from an altered physiological state is a 
great comfort," Rosenthal said. "And so, to some degree, is an acceptance that 
you don't have to be quite as functional all year round, that you can have a 
bit of a fallow season, and that's not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
A light box costs about $400. Early models stood upright, and users sat in 
front of them for as long as four hours a day. The fluorescent tubes emitted a 
full spectrum of light. 
</P>
<P>
Now researchers have learned that higher-intensity light boxes, installed on a 
slanted frame, produce the same results in only half an hour a day. Elimination 
of the ultraviolet spectrum reduces some negative side effects without 
decreasing the light's effectiveness, Rosenthal says. 
</P>
<P>
For winter-depression victims who don't have time for conventional light 
treatment, a portable solution may be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Hellekson, a Seattle psychiatrist, is working with Rosenthal and George 
Brainerd, a Philadelphia neurophysicist, on a small, battery-powered light that 
could be mounted at the front of a pith helmet, permitting wearers to go about 
their normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
No light treatment should be tried without a physician's guidance, Rosenthal 
and others caution. Neil Owen, president of a Rockville, Md., company that 
manufactures light boxes, says he always refers prospective customers to a 
doctor before he sells them a box. 
</P>
<P>
Among his customers is the U.S. State Department. Several boxes have been 
ordered to test their effectiveness among embassy employees who get the blues 
in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries that have long, dark 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
Above the 50th parallel north, SAD is "a pretty significant kind of problem," 
says T.C. Feir, a State Department physician in Vienna, Austria, who has 
jurisdiction over some of the embassies. "We look at this (the lights) with 
considerable interest." 
</P>
<P>
But Feir, like some others, remains unconvinced of the effectiveness of light 
treatment. "There are a lot of skeptics out there," he says. "I consider myself 
a reasonable skeptic." 
</P>
<P>
Winter depression has always been a problem in northern latitudes, but other 
nations have lagged behind the United States in research on it.

WANING CLOUT IN CONGRESS WORRIES TEXAS 
</P>

<P>
Texans strode into Washington last January confident that the Lone Star was in 
ascendancy -- laying claim to the White House, the House speakership and a 
passel of Cabinet posts and congressional committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
They begin 1990 with their influence on the Bush Administration undiminished, 
but their clout in Congress has been reduced by death, illness, a retirement 
and the resignation of their most powerful member. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Michael A. Andrews, a Houston Democrat, says that Texas is coming off a 
"wind-shift year." 
</P>
<P>
Some Texans fear that their legendary clout -- which, at the start of 1989, 
they had predicted would increase -- has waned so much that the state is now at 
a disadvantage in fighting for the federal largess that has traditionally come 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the Senate refused to confirm President Bush's choice of John Tower 
as secretary of defense after exploring allegations of womanizing and excessive 
drinking by the former Texas senator. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, in June, House Speaker Jim Wright abandoned a 34-year 
career in the House and resigned from the most influential position in Congress 
amid an ethics investigation of his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Democratic Rep. Mickey Leland of Houston was killed when his bush 
plane slammed into a remote mountain in Ethiopia on its way to a refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
In October, after suffering abdominal pains, Democratic Rep. Jack Brooks, dean 
of the Texas congressional delegation, was hospitalized for six weeks for 
treatment of an inflamed pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
And, on Dec. 1, Rep. Marvin Leath, an influential Democrat on the House Budget 
and Armed Services committees, announced that he would not seek a seventh term 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, the Texas delegation still landed $225 million to begin 
building the superconducting super collider, a giant particle accelerator that 
scientists hope will help them understand the origins of the universe, and 
fended off a potential attempt to cut $100 million in Pentagon funding for 
Sematech, a national semiconductor research consortium in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Pentagon chose Dyess Air Force Base as a site for rail-based 
MX missiles -- a project that supporters say guarantees the Abilene 
installation a mission into the next century even as budget cutters slash 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
But Texans still face a tough fight to maintain research and development funds 
for another military project -- the V-22 Osprey aircraft -- and they failed to 
obtain tax breaks for the state's troubled oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, said he is afraid that the delegation's 
weakened presence in Washington leaves it vulnerable to new attacks this year 
by other members of Congress who believe Texas has long gotten more than its 
share from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who in April announced that he was a candidate for state attorney 
general, decided in December to pull out of that race and stay in Washington, 
where he can influence next year's spending as a member of the House Budget 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the super collider, Sematech and the space station, being built in 
Houston, all may be under siege in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress reconvenes this week, he said, it will do so "for the first time 
in modern history without a Texas member in a key position to protect our 
state's interests in the budget process." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Texas is hardly without well-positioned members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Its senior senator, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, is chairman of the Finance 
Committee. In the House, Brooks heads the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez is chairman of the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and 
Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of power there," said Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic vice 
presidential candidate and a potential presidential candidate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's fellow senator from Texas, Republican Phil Gramm, put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"Before all this happened, Texas had the greatest degree of influence in 
Washington of any state in the union. Texas still has the most influence of any 
state in the union."

BUSH GIVES ANTI-CRIME BILL TOP PRIORITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush wants Congress to pass this year, as a top priority, an 
anti-crime package that leading Democrats claim will do little if anything to 
slash crime. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech earlier this month, Bush made the anti-crime legislation, along 
with a cut in the capital gains tax and a clean air bill, the top items on his 
legislative agenda for the congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time -- it's past time for Congress to tend to some of the unfinished 
business," Bush said. "It's time for Congress to act quickly and responsibly 
because the war on drugs and crime won't wait." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's words make music in an election year, the rhetoric obscures the 
reality that most of the program the President proposed in May passed as part 
of anti-drug legislation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 principal issues in the sweeping anti-crime proposal, only four are 
left -- those dealing with the death penalty, revisions in the habeas corpus 
and exclusionary rules and controls of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, these 
four will be considered beginning Feb. 7 as part of an anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, where several subcommittees will be involved and where no 
hearings have been held, the situation is less clear. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) who late last year introduced a version 
of the Administration's remaining proposals, said at the time that the four 
items "do not do much to impact on drugs, if at all, and arguably may, or may 
not, reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
Biden said he was not convinced that they will "do very much to produce any 
significant change in the crime picture in America. The realities of these 
proposals will do little, if anything." 
</P>
<P>
The bill alters procedures to meet Supreme Court guidelines for the death 
penalty for 16 crimes -- such as treason and espionage -- and adds the ultimate 
sentence for seven crimes -- genocide, murder of a foreign official, murder by 
a federal prisoner, kidnaping, hostage-taking, murder for hire and murder in 
the aid of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill introduced by Biden, unlike the one that came from the White 
House, would bar the death sentence if it furthers a "racially discriminatory 
pattern." 
</P>
<P>
The other parts would limit appeals by Death Row inmates, write into law the 
"good faith" exemption for searches without warrant and ban the manufacture, 
sale and possession of nine weapons. 
</P>
<P>
To this, Biden added new sections to fight money laundering and to create an 
Organized Crime and Dangerous Drug Division. 
</P>
<P>
Although the revised and expanded Administration proposals will serve as the 
vehicle when the Senate opens debate, Biden has his own more ambitious plan and 
the Administration will propose a new anti-drug program Jan. 29 that will 
include anti-crime elements. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Administration, pressed by drug czar William Bennett, wants 
the death penalty for drug kingpins, even if they are not involved in murder. 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty for drug kingpins linked to murder was approved by Congress 
in 1988 but no case has been brought under that statute. 
</P>
<P>
Biden approaches anti-crime legislation in a far different manner, and his 
package does not include the death penalty or the revisions of the habeas 
corpus and exclusionary rules. 
</P>
<P>
He proposes an additional $600 million to help state and local authorities 
fight crime; 1,000 new FBI and 350 new drug agents, 300 prosecutors and 20 
federal judges; aid to rural police battling drugs; no bail for drug offenses; 
expanded program of forfeiture by those convicted of drug crimes; new statutes 
to crack down on public corruption at the state and local level; power to shut 
down crack houses; more money to combat juvenile gangs; aid to communities 
suffering from a high level of drug trafficking (also expected to be in the 
Administration's new anti-drug program); a Peace Corps-type program to lure 
people into law enforcement work; increasing penalties for gun-related crimes, 
and permitting undercover investigations of receivers of stolen property.

RESTON, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert E. Simon 30 years ago was just another frustrated commuter with a 
typical American dream: to live and work in a place that had both the spark of 
the city and the spirit of the country. 
</P>
<P>
This frustrated commuter, however, was also the owner of Carnegie Hall. So he 
sold it and used some of the proceeds to buy a farm 20 miles west of 
Washington, D.C. Here, in 1962, he started to build his rebuttal to the web of 
highways, housing tracts and shopping centers that had begun to take over 
Fairfax County, Va., and much of the rest of America. 
</P>
<P>
Reston -- its name derived from Simon's initials -- was designed to recreate 
the excitement and diversity of Manhattan's 57th Street in a peaceful, rural 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet instead of changing the suburban landscape, Reston became a part of it. It 
was a community of 50,000 with lots of trees, homes and playgrounds, offices 
and stores, and streets with names such as "Gallant Fox Court," but it had 
little urbanity and no center. 
</P>
<P>
Now, drawing on an unexecuted part of Simon's original plan, the nation's most 
famous "new town" is finally getting an urban core. A grid of streets and 
sidewalks, a public square and office buildings are being carved out of the 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
The same notion is catching on across the nation: Replace or at least modify 
suburbs with compact settlements that mix homes and businesses in a way that 
gets people out of their cars and back in touch with each other. 
</P>
<P>
This comes at a time when many of the most affluent suburban areas are 
resisting growth. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax County, for instance, has more offices and stores than most major 
cities, but there is a feeling that paradise is getting too crowded. 
Pro-development officials have been voted out, and in neighboring Loudon County 
the most popular bumper sticker reads: "Don't Fairfax Loudon." 
</P>
<P>
The obvious solution -- stopping or slowing growth -- has been popular wherever 
suburbia's economic boom threatened the clean, quiet, spacious life that 
attracted people to the country in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
These well-intentioned movements have just one flaw, according to University of 
California-Riverside political scientist Max Neiman: They don't work. 
Developers always find another community that wants their business, and 
sometimes it's the one next door. 
</P>
<P>
Is there no alternative to more concrete and traffic? 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters might as well make the best of the inevitable, Anthony Downs of the 
Brookings Institution said. Get a comfortable, air-conditioned car and equip it 
with a stereo radio, tape deck, telephone and Dictaphone. Share your long ride 
with someone you really like. 
</P>
<P>
His point: As long as people live in houses with big yards and drive long 
distances alone to work, traffic congestion will be the only way to "reconcile 
the competing desires of thousands of people to travel to the same 
destinations, over the same roads, at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
A rival scheme -- build more roads -- has an undeniable logic, but widening 
congested highways often produces nothing more than wider congested highways. 
And who will pay for them? The federally sponsored interstate highway system is 
98% completed and Congress has not approved an addition in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves a third alternative: build new the suburbs to resemble the old 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
"The newest idea in planning," Miami architect Andres Duany is fond of saying, 
"is the 19th-Century town." 
</P>
<P>
When given a choice of living in a city, a suburb, on a farm or in a small 
town, Americans invariably say they prefer the last. Duany is playing on these 
fond, if hazy, impressions of small town life to sell more dense, more urbane 
suburbs with tight grids of streets and squares that place offices, stores and 
recreation areas within walking distance of homes. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old architect sits in his office and, between sips of sweetened 
Cuban coffee, explains where earlier developers went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries-old town planning went out of style after World War II. Americans 
were tired of life in the crowded, dirty, industrial city, and suddenly a 
confluence of cheap money, land, gasoline, cars and highways allowed them to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Suburbs exploded in scale, to the point where, in the expansive new communities 
of the South and Southwest, people must drive a car to do almost anything, 
Duany says. And many of these newer suburbs are designed as giant cul-de-sacs, 
with only a few access streets dumping all the traffic into one jammed through 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best example of the new planning is Seaside, Fla., a resort hamlet 
where Duany and his wife, architect Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, have tried to 
recreate an old-fashioned Southern community, using a strict building code. 
</P>
<P>
Their real ambition, though, is to take the elements of suburbia -- the 
shopping mall, the cul-de-sac, the vast parking lot -- and revise them to allow 
suburbs to expand not by spreading out, but by becoming more dense. 
</P>
<P>
The neotraditional suburb that Duany foresees has a central village green or 
square lined surrounded by buildings instead of a golf course. Shops, offices, 
restaurants and bars occupy the lower floors and there are apartments upstairs. 
Instead of broad, curving cul-de-sacs streets, the town has straight, narrow, 
through streets that creating a sense of being enclosed.

TURKEY, OLD FOES LOOK BACK ON GALLIPOLI

ANKARA, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy-five years after the epic Gallipoli battle, Turkey and its World War I 
foes plan to join forces to commemorate a campaign that produced both chivalry 
and mass slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Some 120 veterans in their 90s, Australian, British, French and Turkish 
warships and national leaders will converge on Gallipoli for the April 25 
ceremonies, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
It will probably be the only time that such a ceremony will be held for the 
battle, which saw the rise of modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, 
and gave Australia and New Zealand their first real sense of nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Turkish President Turgut Ozal, Australian Prime Minister Bob 
Hawke, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, New Zealand Governor-General 
Sir Paul Reeves, other government ministers, diplomats and senior officers are 
likely to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations are being conducted with military precision, down to doctors for 
the veterans and accommodations on land and at sea off the sparsely populated 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"Australia and New Zealand are the only Western countries which have a positive 
image of Turkey. The reason is common experiences in battle," a Foreign 
Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first encounter was in a battle that commanded respect on both sides 
from the way they fought and the way they endured," the official told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the veterans are expected to come from Australia and New Zealand, which 
mark April 25 as a public day of remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have asked Turkey to identify any of their vets (veterans) but we don't 
think they have many because of lower life expectancy here," an Australian 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
For Britain, which headed the Allied force, which also included soldiers from 
India, the campaign -- originally inspired by Winston Churchill -- was a fiasco 
brought about largely by poor intelligence, questionable command and 
ill-equipped troops. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to send warships up the narrow Dardanelles straits to reach 
Constantinople, now Istanbul, and so take Ottoman Turkey, a German ally, out of 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish forces, led by German Gen. Limon von Sanders, ripped into the 
Allied fleet in March, 1915, putting out of action or destroying six of nine 
battleships. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn a month later, on April 25, Allied troops landed at what is now known 
as ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps) Cove and elsewhere at the start 
of trench battles involving a total of some one million troops from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Official records said there were 46,000 deaths among British and French troops 
while 86,692 Turks were killed. Unofficial estimates put Turkish deaths at up 
to 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the prolonged battle, in which machine guns held sway against 
advancing troops, tell of instances when charity overcame hostility between the 
two sides. 
</P>
<P>
After one engagement, Turkish troops held up placards from their trenches 
saying they were hungry. ANZAC soldiers threw over tins of beef and received 
Turkish cigarettes in return. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign ended Jan. 8, 1916, with an ignominious Allied withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Although dwarfed by the carnage on the war's Western Front, Gallipoli was 
horrific by previous standards of modern warfare and a shock to the young 
nations of Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"Gallipoli is very much part of the national character of both countries. It 
signified for many people the start of Australian and New Zealand nationhood," 
one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The Allies have marked each April 25 with ceremonies at cemeteries and sites 
whose names, including Ari Burnu, Chunuk Bair and Lone Pine, have passed into 
Australasian folklore. 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military traditionally celebrates March 18, when its guns and mines 
halted the Allied fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Ataturk, who played a major role as a senior officer at Gallipoli, founded the 
Turkish republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire seven years after the 
battle.

Each day at 6 a.m., Magda Jankovich springs from a skinny bed in the storage 
room of her bar and restaurant, a friendly outpost along a lonely stretch of 
backcountry road in the northeast corner of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Before brewing the morning's first pot of coffee, she creeps into a back-yard 
cottage to awaken Roman Campbell, an 18-year-old orphan she has taken under her 
wing, taught the value of a dollar and recently persuaded to return to high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
A half an hour later, even before the lazy winter sun has climbed over the 
horizon, her griddle is sizzling and a pot of her spicy goulash is already 
simmering on the big kitchen stove. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on a nearby counter stool -- decked out in a colorful print dress and 
one of the 30 elaborate hats from her collection -- the bright-eyed Hungarian 
immigrant peers at magazines and junk mail through bifocal lenses, using two 
huge dictionaries to locate the words she doesn't know, patiently awaiting her 
first customer of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie's Place, that rural institution along California 79 known to regulars as 
an "oasis in the middle of the desert," is open for business. 
</P>
<P>
Said one local: "Maggie's is kind of like the last stop you make before you go 
anyplace to get somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Today, like every other day, the specials are Maggie's famous goulash, spiced 
with paprika and onions. And her cabbage rolls. And what the locals call the 
best pizza this side of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But this is isolated territory, dry and tortured turf tucked behind towering 
Palomar Mountain, miles from the nearest six-lane freeway and well-trodden 
truck stops. Customers out here are about as predictable as a summer storm. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they arrive by horseback, motorcycle, backwoods clunker or 
gun-rack-studded pickup truck, Maggie's country customers roll in off the road 
like famished tumbleweeds -- sometimes alone, other times all at once. 
</P>
<P>
And some of them even sport the bumper sticker Maggie sells at the bar for a 
dollar, the one that reads, "Where'n the HELL is Maggie's Place?" 
</P>
<P>
"There's days where I sit here all morning, and no one comes in," the 
57-year-old woman says in a sweet, lilting voice. "But I just wait it out. And, 
when they do come, sometimes it's in one big herd." 
</P>
<P>
One day, Maggie recalls, the lunchtime rush filled her 12 counter stools and 
all five tables. 
</P>
<P>
"But I handled them all," she said. "I waited on every one of them. And, when I 
was through, they all clapped." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Maggie's Place has opened its doors for the hungry, lost and lonely 
travelers passing through Dodge Valley, an expansive spread of undeveloped 
ranchland just a coyote's howl south of the Riverside County line. 
</P>
<P>
Seven days a week, sometimes 20 hours a day, Maggie is there to greet them, 
wiping her hands on a soiled apron -- working not only as sole owner, but also 
as waitress, cook, dishwasher, bartender and yes, even bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
A political dissident who fled her homeland during the 1956 Hungarian 
Revolution with her husband Laszlo, Maggie knows the value of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
The couple spent 20 years carving out an existence of piecemeal jobs throughout 
the Midwest -- picking fruit and selling odds and ends door-to-door -- before 
Laszlo's death near St. Louis in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Now Maggie sleeps in a storage room of her restaurant, amid stacked cases of 
warm beer. For her, this place is home. She starts each day early -- and ends 
it late -- as though it will be her last chance to serve her beloved regulars. 
</P>
<P>
But Maggie's story could well have ended five years ago, back when she and her 
two sons ran Mom and Pop's diner, another restaurant about a dozen miles down 
the road in Radec. The owner decided not to renew their lease. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Homer Harris, a nearby rancher, came to her rescue. He loaned 
Maggie nearly $100,000 to buy the shell of an old restaurant up the road. With 
characteristic zeal, she moved into the new place, spread water buckets beneath 
leaky spots in the roof, and used a broom to shoo away the snakes. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, after refurbishing the kitchen, rebuilding the roof and applying 
a fresh coat of paint, she reopened for business. This time, the venture was 
simply called Maggie's Place. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one thing I respect about that woman," said Harris, explaining why 
he lent so much cash to a virtual stranger, "it's that she's willing to do hard 
work every day. 
</P>
<P>
"People relate to her tenacity to open that business and stay on her feet 12 
hours a day. And she's not offended when the locals act up and start their 
swearing contests. She knows how to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Maggie is once again leasing the other restaurant in Radec. But she has 
hired a manager to take care of business there. These days, her attentions are 
focused at home, at Maggie's Place. 
</P>
<P>
"You put your time in," she says. "And you work, work, work, work, work -- most 
times by yourself. That's how you get ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The business sits along the old stagecoach route between San Diego and Northern 
California, locals say. And, although times have changed since the last 
horse-drawn coach rumbled through here nearly a century ago, some pretty rough 
customers still walk through her doors. 
</P>
<P>
But Maggie's a tough customer herself. With a robust, frontier spirit that even 
the roughest-edged regulars have come to respect, she lays down the law in 
Maggie's Place. 
</P>
<P>
And beware to the greenhorn customer who says something to catch her fancy. 
That's when Maggie lets loose a patented belly laugh that sends some regulars 
reaching for their ears, protecting themselves from a sound that's been 
described as a cross between a fire siren, whooping crane and a laughing hyena 
gasping for air. 
</P>
<P>
"HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE," goes Maggie's cackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," says Harris, now one of Maggie's closest friends. "That laugh can 
get to you. And, who knows what's going to set it off?" 
</P>
<P>
That laugh, along with her stubborn will to survive in these financial wilds, 
has some of Maggie's other customers shaking their heads as well. 
</P>
<P>
"A normal business person would probably get burned out in a place like this 
real quick," said one regular known as Pat the bartender. 
</P>
<P>
"The back hills out here are a kind of refuge for all kinds of humanity and 
fly-by-night hillbillies. It's tough territory, but Maggie is as tough as the 
land. She's a character herself, and she knows how to take care of the clowns 
and drunks and big old biker monsters who stumble into this place. 
</P>
<P>
"To quote Maggie, 'I ain't afraid of no man.' And she means it." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Weidmann, whose wide-brimmed cowboy hat shades his graying beard, sees 
Maggie's tough-gal stubbornness as first-class entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is man's territory, filled with proud people who won't back down to 
anyone," he said. "So it's a joy to see Maggie in the face of some tough guy, 
watching him suddenly kick back. 
</P>
<P>
"You laugh, wondering whether he's going to get up and leave. You watch to see 
how he's going to keep his composure." 
</P>
<P>
Maggie has established a few rules for the house. No fighting. No gambling at 
the pool table. And no stepping behind the bar or kitchen counter, period. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Weidmann broke one of those rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I stepped behind the bar to empty an ashtray," he recalled. "Well, she 
was in my face for 10 minutes right in front of everybody, saying that nobody 
goes behind her bar. 
</P>
<P>
"She made me feel real small. But it worked. Now I respect her turf." 
</P>
<P>
The way Maggie sees it, anyone who doesn't respect her restaurant, doesn't 
respect Maggie. And that means trouble. 
</P>
<P>
When two brothers recently started a fight over a pool game, Maggie flew into 
action. Usually, she keeps the bar open until legal closing time or everyone 
has had enough fun, whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
Not this night, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up the cue ball from the table and shut off the lights," she said. "I 
told the people at the bar they could all go home, every last one of them, 
because they had ruined that night. The way I see it, if they can't get along 
without acting like small children, it's time to go." 
</P>
<P>
Although they respect her spunk, many locals wonder just how well Maggie sleeps 
at night. In recent years, the foothills east of Palomar Mountain have become 
home to drug peddlers who run their illegal methamphetamine labs and bad-news 
burglars who cruise the backcountry, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous place sometimes," said Weidmann, who has been burglarized 
several times in the past year and recently lost his gun and knife collection 
to thieves. 
</P>
<P>
"There's druggies and thieves and crazies. For a woman to be around here alone 
at night, it's something to be worried about." 
</P>
<P>
But Maggie refuses to flinch -- despite two recent attempted break-ins, one by 
a man who shattered her window in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I yelled out, 'What on earth are you doing?' By the time I put my robe on, he 
had run to his car and drove off. So you see, I'm not scared. He's the one who 
is scared." 
</P>
<P>
She called the sheriff, who came out several days later. Way out here, Maggie 
says, she often is forced to fend for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Some outlaw types have made her a more skeptical businesswoman. Not long ago, 
several off-duty Marines carried some liquor, cigarettes and several cases of 
beer out the back door of her bar, she said. Now she keeps the door locked. 
</P>
<P>
But true to her style, Maggie writes off the theft as an isolated incident. She 
even makes an off-handed joke about it. And she brays her Maggie laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE," goes Maggie. 
</P>
<P>
She says she doesn't recall where she learned to laugh like that. But during a 
recent trip back home to Hungary, her 81-year-old uncle told Maggie what he 
missed most about her was that laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"So I laughed a lot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's all part of the softer side to Maggie's style, locals say. In the 
backcountry where banks and post offices are few and far between, she offers 
credit, cashes checks and accepts mail and phone calls for many regular 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
At night, she has swiped the car keys of more than one buckaroo who has boozed 
it up past his limit, phoning a friend to come haul him home. Recently, one 
drunk cowboy even slept off the night's damage at Maggie's back-yard cottage. 
</P>
<P>
Regulars have even met and married at the bar. Maggie and the women throw out a 
spread of champagne and Hungarian home cooking while the boys drink beer and 
whiskey, shoot pool and listen to country-and-Western tunes on the jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
And Maggie has a thing for strays. So far, she has taken in three dogs -- Gypsy 
Star, Snow and Hymie -- who lounge away most afternoons on her front porch and, 
sometimes, under her counter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in bad moods and then come in here and see Maggie happy," Weidmann 
said. "Bad things have happened to her and she laughs them off. And so, I tell 
myself, 'Why am I so cranky? Just look at Maggie!' " 
</P>
<P>
Roman Campbell knows firsthand about Maggie's generosity. For more than a year, 
the former orphan has lived with Maggie while he attends high school in Julian 
and works nights in her restaurant kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he asked the widow for a job last year and she consented -- on 
the condition that he drop the crowd that he had been hanging out with. It's 
worked out for both of them, he said; and, as he spoke, Maggie stood behind the 
counter, peering through her bifocals, her face aglow. 
</P>
<P>
"She treats me like a son," he said. "She's taught me about responsibility and 
managing my money. I guess she's like a mother to just about everyone in here." 
</P>
<P>
One day, Maggie says, Roman might even take over the restaurant when she 
retires. Until then, though, Maggie's word is still law around these parts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get lonely," she says. "I work all day. And, when I go to bed, I'm 
ready to put my head down and go to sleep. I've got no time to be lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Then she stops and throws her head back. 
</P>
<P>
"HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE . . . HEEEE," goes Maggie.

BISHOP BROM CELEBRATES OPEN-AIR MASS AT MIGRANT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MCDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The immigrant workers and their families gathered in a makeshift chapel amid a 
willow thicket early Saturday to hear their new bishop, who made an effort to 
deliver his message in their language. His words were heard above the rush of a 
nearby stream, now swollen from recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus was a worker too; he understood what it was to be tired from his labor," 
Bishop Robert H. Brom told the assembled gathering, mostly field hands from 
Mexico who can't afford the area's high housing prices and live in crude 
dwellings amid the surrounding chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus was interested in the poor, and in all people who suffered," Brom told 
listeners in the chilly morning air redolent with the aroma of sage and willow. 
"Brothers, I'm here to tell you that the church of God loves you and wants to 
help you." 
</P>
<P>
It was a deliberate message of involvement and concern from the man who is in 
line to become the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, making 
him the most influential religious leader in the San Diego area. Bishop Brom, 
formerly Bishop of Duluth, Minn., is slated to succeed Bishop Leo T. Maher in 
July, when Maher turns 75, the Church's mandatory retirement age. Maher will 
step down after two decades as the pastoral guide for the area's Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
It seems clear from Brom's visit Saturday and from his comments that Latino and 
immigrant-laborer issues are likely to be at the forefront of his agenda, 
signaling a reversal of what many view as Bishop Maher's more ambivalent 
attitude toward such matters. Later Saturday, the area's Latino community was 
to receive Brom officially during a ceremony at St. Joseph's Cathedral in 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For Brom, a 51-year-old, seemingly mild-mannered Midwesterner who was reared in 
rural Wisconsin and Minnesota, the Mass he celebrated in the brush and his 
subsequent visit to one of the area's largest migrant encampments appeared to 
be an eye-opener. Never before, he said, had he seen such primitive living 
conditions, particularly the striking contrast between the poverty of the 
workers and the wealth of the surrounding community. Such scenes have become 
commonplace in the San Diego area, although they are still jarring, 
particularly to newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"The disparity is remarkable," Brom said afterward as he stood amid the 
shanties of plastic, scrap wood and cardboard that mark McGonigle Canyon in the 
Rancho Penasquitos area of San Diego. "I'm surprised. Who could explain this? 
You have to see it. You have to walk through it, to enter into it." 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred workers reside in the shacks, which have no running water or 
electricity. A raging fire last year destroyed many of the dwellings, forcing 
the workers to rebuild. Heavy rains have created a muddy quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, there has been some talk of evicting the migrants, who are squatters 
on private land slated for future redevelopment. Similar encampments and 
predicaments can be found throughout northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was appointed coadjutor, or heir-apparent, last May, Brom has stressed 
his interest in reaching out to the region's large population of Latinos, 
particularly Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals who reside here. He 
estimates that 40-45 % of the area's more than 600,000 Catholics are Latinos. 
The proximity of the U.S.-Mexico border contributes to a continual upward trend 
in the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
'We're in dialogue right now, trying to decide how the diocese might better 
respond to the needs of the Hispanic community, to better include (them)," 
noted Brom, who has been meeting in recent weeks with representatives from 
throughout the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who work with the immigrant and Latino community, there is 
considerable hope that the new bishop will emphasize those issues in the way 
that Archbishop Roger Mahony has done in Los Angeles. They viewed his visits 
Saturday as a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
"For him to come and meet with the people shows real character," said Gina 
Velasquez, a volunteer from nearby Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church who has long 
worked with migrant laborers in the fields. Father Frank Fawcett, pastor of Mt. 
Carmel, invited the bishop to the outdoor Mass, which has been a weekly event 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Brom spent a month studying Spanish in Mexico, a skill that he will 
have ample opportunity to use during his time in San Diego, one of the world's 
great migratory corridors and the principal entry point for hundreds of Latin 
Americans daily seeking to enter the United States, with and without documents. 
His Spanish is still embryonic, he acknowledges, but the migrants gathered 
Saturday clearly appreciated his effort. 
</P>
<P>
"To accomplish the mission of a priest and bishop, you have to enter into where 
people are, by using language, by your presence," Brom said, explaining his 
decision to learn Spanish. "I knew I could never do that with a translator; you 
come off as distant." 
</P>
<P>
Being distant is clearly not the style preferred by Brom, who was known in 
Duluth for his unpretentious ways, administrative skills and his ability to 
inspire others by relating Christian doctrine to everyday situations. His 
method is hands-on. 
</P>
<P>
After Mass, still donning his green bishop's robes, he personally greeted most 
everyone in the crowd, liberally offering blessings to men, women and children. 
Later he spoke repeatedly of the importance of seeking change and improvement 
through grass-roots contacts with migrant workers and other underprivileged 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus became flesh; he entered the world to change it from within," Brom said, 
reciting a basic principle of Christianity. "The Word would never have become 
flesh if it hadn't come down from Heaven and gotten down and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
He routinely uses words such as "liberation" and "solidarity," which often have 
political connotations, particularly in Latin America. But Brom, like the 
Church hierarchy in Rome, warns against "politicization" of the Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
For Brom, the visit also brought back his rural, working-class upbringing, when 
he himself picked strawberries, beans and other crops. "I know what it is to 
work the way these people do," he said. "It gave me a feeling of living close 
to the earth." 
</P>
<P>
After one visit, he wasn't prepared to offer solutions to the dilemma of 
migrant housing. A first step, he concluded, would be to "sensitize" people to 
the reality of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the camps, who remain wary of outsiders, the visit of such a 
high-ranking church official was welcomed. "We come from so far away, and we 
are so different here, that it makes us happy that someone like that would take 
the time to be with us," noted Jacinto Cortez, a 33-year-old Mexican laborer.

OFFICIALS SEE HOTELS AS ONE WAY TO CARE FOR HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE CONCEPT OF SINGLE-ROOM-OCCUPANCY FACILITIES WILL BE STUDIED BY 
ORANGE COUNTY. IT ALREADY IS HELPING SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN 
DIEGO.

<P>
Mike and Luann Mitchell pulled into Orange County six months ago and 
immediately knew they had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Newly arrived from Michigan, Mike, without a job, and Luann, four months 
pregnant, had bright hopes of building a new future, but they had nowhere to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of sleeping in their cramped car, the Mitchells moved into a seedy 
Anaheim motel, joining thousands of other low-income residents who either 
remain homeless or are forced to live in poorly maintained, ill-equipped motels 
because they cannot afford the area's high rents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents such as the Mitchells, however, may soon be offered a significant new 
housing option if a plan being forged by Orange County officials is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The officials want to build single-room-occupancy hotels, called SROs, a 
once-maligned type of low-income housing that is enjoying a renaissance around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty or 70 years ago, they were a home to traveling salesmen or other 
wayfarers, gradually decaying into the dirty, paint-chipped, torn-furniture 
refuges of people with little hope of anything better. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, they were the first target of the redeveloper's bulldozer. But 
now, in an ironic turnabout, many communities see them as an attractive, cheap 
source of housing for burgeoning numbers of elderly, homeless and working-poor 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, city officials have placed moratoriums on demolition of 
existing residential hotels. And San Diego has established a model SRO program, 
with 2,500 new units built or under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials recently announced plans to form a task force that will 
explore the idea of developing SRO hotels based on the San Diego model. 
</P>
<P>
"If done with care and quality, we can put low-income housing in a community 
like Orange County where the cost of land is very expensive," said Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel H. Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton have been the key backers 
of the SRO concept in Orange County, visiting and talking with San Diego 
housing officials and trying to persuade colleagues that SROs are feasible -- 
even in traditionally conservative Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But SROs are not without controversy. Orange County homeless advocates who 
favor SROs point to numerous recent instances of social service groups being 
locked out of communities by neighbors who fear increased crime and other 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are likely to be reluctant to embrace the idea of building what 
are essentially hotels for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cities will want to participate, maybe even provide funds, but the 
crux will be finding places for them to be built," said Susan Oakson, 
coordinator of homeless programs for the Orange County Homeless Issues Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
Young said he hopes to get support from all 29 cities in the county to build at 
least one 200-unit SRO in each city. But he acknowledged that many communities 
will initially be wary. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot of education," he said. "But one of the secrets of the 
success is that these hotels will be located along commercial boulevards and 
not in residential neighborhoods. They will be as compatible with a community's 
profile as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Many housing officials are now realizing that they must persuade the public 
that low-income housing offers advantages to a community. 
</P>
<P>
If a city is faced with large numbers of homeless people who have nowhere to 
sleep but the local park, residents risk losing that resource, said Joe 
Carreras, a senior housing planner with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. "If a community doesn't address that problem, it won't go away," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Many developers and business owners have expressed interest in the concept of 
SROs for the same reason, said Bart Hansen, a partner in Shawntana Development 
and a board member of the Building Industry Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Substandard Housing 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by increasing numbers of immigrants, the stock of substandard housing 
has risen. At the same time, Orange County has developed virtually no 
subsidized low-income housing and is not likely to do so in the future, Hansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think SROs would hit the need where the need is," Hansen said. "This kind of 
concept goes hand in hand with business development." 
</P>
<P>
Young said successful development of SROs in Orange County is predicated on 
their being privately owned and funded. Many of the projects would probably be 
built by for-profit developers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But many housing advocates and SRO experts say private ownership is fraught 
with the potential for problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some private owners have failed to maintain their buildings and have provided 
inadequate management, they say. And SROs built by for-profit developers tend 
to be priced too high for the tenants who really need them. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of nonprofit ownership is that it is set up for a social purpose 
to eliminate a social problem," Carreras said. 
</P>
<P>
"A for-profit developer will get whatever the market bears," said Andy 
Raubeson, executive director of the Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp. of Los 
Angeles. "If the rents average $420 a month and general relief is $220, then 
the person who must depend on general relief is not going to be able to live in 
SROs." 
</P>
<P>
The corporation is a nonprofit agency financed by the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency and is one of the largest single owners of SROs. The group 
owns 12 residential hotels -- the oldest dates back to 1889 and most were built 
just after the turn of the century -- which have been renovated to meet the 
needs of the elderly, mentally ill and recovering alcoholics as well as other 
low-income tenants. The group also is involved in building new units. 
</P>
<P>
Raubeson said rents average $175 to $200. The SROs have been effective in 
taking people off the streets and in providing a safety net for those 
precariously perched on the edge of homelessness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are people for whom one crisis, like losing a job or a serious illness, 
would mean the difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that development of SROs would also benefit a broad range of Orange 
County's neediest residents and that participation of nonprofit organizations 
would be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a whole variety of ways of financing, owning and operating 
the projects," he said. "In Santa Ana, for example, we would hope to be able to 
work with the YWCA, which now operates a shelter for homeless women, and 
convert that into an SRO, a transitional facility." 
</P>
<P>
And Young noted that the San Diego SRO program, on which the Orange County 
project would be based, has had great success. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego effort grew out of a desire to preserve existing SROs, but 
sponsors quickly realized that the problem was not one of preservation but of 
inadequate supply, said Judith Lenthall, director of the city's SRO program. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, about 2,500 privately owned SRO units have been developed in the 
city. Rents average about $275 a month. Occupancy rates have remained at or 
near capacity, Lenthall said. 
</P>
<P>
Each room is furnished and contains a built-in wall unit with a toilet and 
sink, a closet, refrigerator and television. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the hotels, tenants share shower facilities located on each floor. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of San Diego's hotel residents revealed that about one-third are 
elderly and on some sort of fixed income, another third are working poor and 
about 20% are disabled and dependent on disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't solve homelessness, but people in the hotels would surely otherwise 
be out on the streets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been stigmas attached to SROs in the past, evidenced by such 
terms as "flophouses" or "fleabag hotels," Lenthall said most residents are 
grateful for -- and proud of -- their new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Negative' 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing negative about this," she said. "It's not low-income housing 
that they are forced to live in by some government program. There's no stigma 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Lenthall, who presented details of the San Diego project to members of the 
Orange County chapter of the League of Cities recently, said she is likely to 
become more intimately involved in local SRO development when she assumes 
duties as president of the organization Builders for People this month. 
</P>
<P>
The group, a nonprofit arm of the Building Industry Assn., will sponsor 
development of emergency housing, including SROs, in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The association already has endorsed the Orange County project, Young said. The 
new task force plans a general information meeting in February and will work 
this year to create a model SRO ordinance and to identify suitable locations 
for hotels in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the first building projects could begin in early 1991.

BAY'S FUTURE RESTS ON PORT DISTRICT APPOINTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: NEW COMMISSIONERS COULD ENSURE THAT SAN DIEGO'S TIDELANDS ARE 
CLEANED UP, RESTORED AND PROTECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN McKIRNAN, Dan McKirnan is chairman of the Environmental Health 
Coalition's Clean Bay Campaign. He is a research physiologist at the UC San 
Diego School of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Bay is a key economic and environmental feature of the region. But 
the bay's reputation as a polluted waterway attests to decades of exploitation. 
An opportunity is now at hand to see that environmental protection of the bay 
and its special natural resources are better represented and its potential to 
serve all the people of San Diego is more fully realized. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council will be making a critical decision shortly on whom 
to appoint to two of the most important and powerful positions in the state of 
California -- commissioners to the San Diego Unified Port District. The Port 
District has authority over nearly all the tidelands in San Diego Bay. This 
decision takes on even more importance given the numerous challenges ahead for 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to develop bayfront acreage is accelerating amid evidence of 22 
contaminated underground water sites in downtown San Diego alone. The new 
Convention Center along with other construction projects have intruded into 
these underground basins, and the sites may be drawing toxic contaminants 
toward the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next few years, the fate of critical natural wetlands in the vast 
southern part of San Diego Bay must be weighed against development. There are 
proposals driven by very narrow special interests to build a second harbor 
entrance. And San Diego may be the host in defending the America's Cup, which 
would bring an unprecedented number of new tenants and visitors to the bay as 
early as November. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that the City Council and all San Diegans look to the future of our 
great bay and the challenge that lies ahead: to clean up, restore and protect 
San Diego Bay as a multi-use resource. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District has the statutory responsibilities to promote navigation, 
commerce, recreation and fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two areas, a lot more can and will have to be done if we are to 
even approach the goal set by the federal Clean Water Act nearly 20 years ago 
to make this waterway "fishable and swimmable." The expenditures and progress 
toward promoting fisheries and water-contact recreation in the 27 years since 
the Port District's creation has been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, commercial fishermen report a significant diminishment in the 
numbers of fish and the diversity of species in the bay. And many of the fish 
they do find have tumors, lesions and evidence of other problems with their 
bay-water habitat. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the chairman of a port commission subcommittee recently 
announced that bay water quality posed a negligible risk to human health from 
water-contact activities such as swimming. However, this was based on surveys 
of information and studies available on just two pollutants in the bay -- 
copper and tributyltin. Both pollutants have been used as anti-fouling agents 
in boat-bottom coatings, and copper has been spilled in huge quantities as a 
result of seven years of loading at the Port District's National City 24th 
Street Terminal, which was leased to a private company. 
</P>
<P>
This spill of copper resulted in the state naming the Port District a 
primary-responsible party in the pollution of the bay. In fact, the Port 
District has been named as a primary- and secondary-responsible party in a 
number of orders to clean up toxic pollution of the bay. And the state now 
designates the port as a responsible party for all of its tenants who have 
pollution-discharge permits. 
</P>
<P>
It is more than a little odd to have an agency that has been charged with 
polluting this important resource able to pass judgment on water quality and 
human health, especially given the complexity of this issue and the need for 
more information about the extent of contamination and its effects on the bay 
food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District has even declared the health risk from toxic contaminants in 
Convair lagoon as minimal, and yet this area has been posted for nearly two 
years with warning signs by the county Department of Health Services. Convair 
lagoon has sediments containing some of the highest concentrations of PCBs on 
the West Coast. Professor Jack Conway, a member of one of the Port District's 
toxic waste advisory subcommittees, echoed the comments of other committee 
members when he said it was "premature to make statements about the bay until 
all the data is in." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the public is being assured that there is little risk to 
swimming in the bay, the Crosby Street park in Barrio Logan is off limits to 
water-contact activities and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District is paying for a health risk assessment study, which is being 
conducted by county Department of Health Services. But the scope of the study 
will be limited by the funding: $250,000. This is a minimal amount contrasted 
with the port's annual budget of $80 million, with $162 million in reserves. 
Surely some greater portion of these monies should be devoted to clean-up, 
protection and restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District will not meet its statutory responsibilities by wishful 
thinking and half-hearted support for the many studies and programs needed to 
protect San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor listed San Diego Bay and reforms to the Port District at 
the top of the list for the "environmental protection package" attached to her 
recent State of the City address: "The Port Act must be reviewed to assign 
environmental protection and preservation a higher priority, instead of an 
afterthought to economic development." 
</P>
<P>
This is a fitting call to action for this new decade and the 20th anniversary 
of Earth Day. We hope that the City Council will bear this in mind as it 
considers the qualifications of the growing list of candidates to serve as new 
port commissioners. With the Exxon Valdez undergoing repairs here in San Diego 
Bay as a reminder of how fragile our marine environment is, the San Diego City 
Council should be searching for commissioners with an understanding of 
natural-resource issues and a real dedication and commitment to clean up, 
restore and protect this great bay for all San Diegans to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
We can't afford to let this critical opportunity fall to political expediency. 
We need a clean sweep of the past for a clean bay in the future.

BIAS AGAINST LESBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very proud to be a part of the lesbian and gay contingent marching in the 
Martin Luther King Jr. parade last weekend. At the same time I was impressed by 
the commitment of those at the parade toward civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
I was again reminded how individuals who are lesbian and gay do not have the 
same protection under the law as other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
I found it ironic, at the parade to celebrate civil rights, a lesbian friend of 
mine could not march with our contingent because her employer is harassing her 
because she is a lesbian. Her lawyer advised her not to be at events that would 
identify her as a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
When I talk to groups and individuals about the problems of discrimination 
against the lesbian and gay community, I am frequently told, "It doesn't matter 
what you do in the bedroom but why do you have to make such a big deal about it 
and flaunt it." 
</P>
<P>
Flaunting it frequently means walking with my arm around my significant other 
or being blatant by daring to hold hands with someone of the same sex, or while 
at work talking about my relationship in the same way heterosexuals refer to 
their partners. That is flaunting my being a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, it is perfectly OK for heterosexuals to engage in these 
behaviors in public and is usually thought to be cute or nice. Hmm, somehow it 
doesn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination still happens in our country. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream is 
still not a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Agreed, the discrimination is more subtle than what occurs in South Africa. But 
it occurs against people of color, against people of different religions, and 
of various ethnic backgrounds. It is still legal in this country to 
discriminate against lesbians and gays. The armed forces sanction the 
discrimination; in some states, homosexuals have no right to privacy; and in 
San Diego there is no recourse against discrimination due to one's sexual 
orientation in many employment situations. 
</P>
<P>
I am outraged that as a citizen of the United States who happens to be a 
lesbian, I do not have equal protection under the Constitution, not special, 
just equal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed "Human Dignity Ordinance" in the city of San Diego is just one 
step in working toward equal protection. Until all people of this country are 
free, none of us will be.

2 PROGRAMS BATTLE FOR SCHOOL TURF; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: NOWHERE DO TENSIONS BETWEEN MAGNET PROGRAMS AND THEIR HOST SCHOOLS 
APPEAR LARGER THAN AT SAN PEDRO'S PARK WESTERN PLACE ELEMENTARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the day before students were to come back to class at Park Western Place 
Elementary School in San Pedro, and Principal Albert Stebinger was hosting a 
lunch for the teachers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
As teacher Sue Block recalls, Stebinger asked the faculty at the Harbor 
Math/Science Magnet for gifted children, which shares the campus with Park 
Western, to join in. When they said no because they had brought their lunch, 
Stebinger suggested they sit in nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked them two or three different ways," Block recalled. "He was very 
tactful, but we were getting the definite feeling that they didn't want to join 
us in anything." 
</P>
<P>
And so it has been since September on the campus of Park Western, where 
teachers at the community school and the magnet are feuding about everything 
from which school gets to use the library at what time to whether the students 
should eat lunch together to what disciplinary code should govern the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The battle, which both sides say has been festering for years, has become so 
bitter that some teachers from one side won't talk to those on the other. 
Stebinger, who is in charge of both schools, admits that he is caught in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
It has also exposed a glitch in the Los Angeles Unified School District's new 
system of "shared decision-making councils," in which parents and teachers now 
have a say in some matters, such as discipline and scheduling, that once were 
the purview of principals alone. 
</P>
<P>
Two councils -- one for the magnet and one for the "host school" -- were 
established on the Park Western campus this fall. But they are now locked in a 
stalemate over the discipline issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very delicate situation," acknowledged Frances Nakano, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District regional superintendent who is overseeing negotiations 
between the sides. "They're going to have to come to a consensus, and I hope it 
doesn't take all semester." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers on both sides acknowledge that the dispute is draining the energy they 
have for their classes. "I really feel like I'm gypping the kids," said Paralee 
Hanson, who teaches at the magnet. "They're wonderful kids, and I'm not giving 
them as much as I should." 
</P>
<P>
And that is angering parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are losing sight of what the purpose of the school is," complained 
David Russell, whose daughter is a third-grader in the magnet program. "While 
the teachers are busy trying to reach agreement among themselves on things, 
that's time that otherwise would have been spent working with the children. As 
a parent, I have a problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some parents say the bad feelings are filtering down to their kids. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter even has friends that used to go to the regular school and then 
transferred to the magnet," said Wanda Rodriguez, whose daughter is a 
sixth-grader at the community school. "Now, they don't even talk to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
There are 95 magnet schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District and, 
although they have different specialties, all operate under a court-ordered 
mandate to promote integration. Only 22 have separate campuses; the rest must 
share campuses with neighborhood schools, according to Richard Battaglia, a 
magnet specialist for the district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say strife between magnets and their host schools has 
happened elsewhere. But Battaglia and Nakano said they know of no other school 
where the dissension is as severe as it is at Park Western. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously avoidable," Battaglia said, "because not every magnet center in 
the district is undergoing the same amount of strife." 
</P>
<P>
At Park Western, the tensions stem in part from socioeconomic differences, 
differing educational philosophies and disagreements about whether these two 
programs, each with its own distinct mission, can coexist under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
With 284 students, Park Western Place Elementary School is classified by the 
district as a PHBAO school (Predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian and Other 
minorities). Its pupils come from a primarily low-income neighborhood; many 
live in nearby Park Western Estates, a government-subsidized apartment complex. 
And, according to teachers and parents, most qualify for either a free or 
reduced-fare lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the magnet school draws its 251 students from 56 different school 
areas throughout Los Angeles. Magnet coordinator Darlene Dye boasts that "our 
children have over 23 languages spoken in the home. We have Croatian, Italian, 
Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
Dye has encouraged an extraordinary amount of parent involvement in the magnet 
school. Magnet parents say they go to great lengths to raise extra money to 
provide their children with educational extras, including specialized math 
instruction and trips to Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
But those extras have caused resentment in the community school. 
</P>
<P>
"They have money for field trips," community school teacher Patricia Ertzman 
complained. "Our program doesn't come with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody seems to know how the trouble at Park Western began, both sides 
agree that such grievances have been hanging over the campus for the past eight 
years, ever since the magnet school moved onto the Park Western campus from the 
Taper Avenue Elementary School, also in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute finally spilled into the open this fall when the community school, 
which needed an additional classroom, moved into a room that had been used by 
the magnet for a math lab. The magnet then moved its math lab into the library, 
angering community school teachers who said their kids were not getting enough 
library time. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us garbage times," Block complained. "They took exactly what they 
wanted -- prime time." 
</P>
<P>
But magnet school teachers said the community school has been unwilling to give 
up an extra room that its teachers use for lunch. Nakano, the regional 
superintendent, said he is trying to settle the matter by arranging for a 
bungalow to be moved onto campus. 
</P>
<P>
After holding meetings with parents this fall, Nakano also stepped in and 
ordered that the two schools adopt a uniform discipline code and that they 
share lunches, recesses and other activities. "They were doing things in kind 
of a separate fashion, and I thought they should come together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation did not go over well at the magnet school, where teachers 
complain that they are being forced to compromise their rigorous program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being asked to ignore the fact that there is space available on the 
campus that we need," said Linda Ross, who teaches humanities at the magnet. 
"We feel that a lot of the decisions made do not support a program that really 
works. We're being asked to modify the situation here on campus, and it is not 
one that lends itself to the best that we could do." 
</P>
<P>
The magnet teachers complain that they have been denied state honors because 
their students' test scores are commingled with Park Western scores. The magnet 
teachers are also pressing for separate lunch periods and recesses, more 
independence and their own site. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have an identity crisis," said Dye, the magnet coordinator. "When 
you're working night and day to build an exemplary program, it's really a 
difficult swallow that you can't be like the big folks who are doing it in 
other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Nakano said whether the magnet can become independent "remains to be seen. . . 
. If that's the case, it will have to be a policy decision by the board." 
</P>
<P>
Dye and her teachers, meanwhile, have been branded as elitists by some 
community school teachers and parents who say that instead of promoting 
integration, the magnet is promoting segregation. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of magnet parents agree. These parents, who did not want to be 
identified for fear their children would be singled out at school, say Dye and 
the magnet school teachers have blown the dispute out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Walls are coming down all over. But in our school they're putting up walls," 
said one magnet parent. "Our children are being put in an environment of gifted 
kids only. They're being told they are different; they are special. If they 
keep this kind of environment where they're not getting along with the school 
next door, how are they going to get along with the outside world?" 
</P>
<P>
Said another parent: "What I think is going on is that the magnet parents are 
being manipulated by the staff to cause a lot of rigmarole so that we can get 
our own campus." 
</P>
<P>
Dye could not be reached to respond to that specific charge, but she and other 
magnet teachers said in earlier interviews that they are simply doing what they 
believe is best for their students. They are dismayed that they are viewed as 
elitists and added that it is essential for them to treat magnet students 
differently because gifted children have special needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these people are saying we want to be elite, we want to be snobs and, 
honestly, that isn't the case," Hanson said. "A lot of people think, 'Well, 
that child is gifted, what problems does he have?' The gifted kids come with a 
lot of anxieties, a lot of problems. They're a real minority, and they need to 
be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
Magnet teachers, as well as some magnet parents, said a separate site would 
enable them to pursue their program more freely. And the separate lunches and 
recesses are necessary, they said, because the students from the two schools 
get into playground scrapes that cannot be resolved because of the different 
disciplinary codes. 
</P>
<P>
The magnet school uses a "magic circle" system of discipline, in which students 
are not punished but are encouraged to talk out their problems with one another 
and their teachers. The community school uses more traditional disciplinary 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was no strife between the two campuses, and it's simply a matter of 
the kids playing together and eating together, I have no problem," said magnet 
parent Stephen Cravitz. "If we lived in that kind of school, we would have no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Cravitz, however, said he is not sure that harmony will ever come to the Park 
Western campus. "It seems to me that the hurts have gone pretty deep," he said. 
"There are people at this point who just plain don't want to talk to each 
other."

The classroom is alive with activity and chatter. Women lean forward, intently 
pasting together fabric, paper and cardboard. Others draw with bright markers. 
Some sit still, content just to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Skuce, 87, gently claps her hands and inspects the small notebook she 
has created. "My book," she squeals. "Hooray." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Ewin, 89, says she may use her notebook to record "little notations of 
things that are coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Emma Maryman, 93, does not speak, but grins broadly at her finished product, 
assembled with a lot of help from workshop leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Dorothy has forgotten where her notebook came from. Others will 
also soon forget. The workshop, however, has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of dozens sponsored each month by Arts for the Aging, a nonprofit 
group in Washington that uses professional artists to bring art into the lives 
of the elderly, particularly victims of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The program sends painters, mimes, harpists, dancers, storytellers and others 
to adult day-care centers and nursing homes to involve older people in the arts 
and stimulate their creativity. 
</P>
<P>
One week participants may help make a quilt, another time they will learn 
pantomime, sometimes they hear stories, often they paint or draw. 
</P>
<P>
The program succeeds where countless other arts and crafts projects "never seem 
to achieve anything but frustration," reported Sara Gibson of the Bethesda 
Fellowship House, an adult day-care center in suburban Maryland. The artists 
"allow the often unusual creativity seen in Alzheimer's participants to 
flourish rather than attempting to stifle it with conformity." 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Brown, recreation director for Iona House, another center visited by 
Arts for the Aging, said it gives patients with intellectual problems a new way 
to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the cognitively impaired elderly have the ability to appreciate art. Art 
can reach the emotional side of them, which can still be functioning and in 
need of being utilized." 
</P>
<P>
Artists who conduct the workshops are specially trained to teach the aged and 
to help even Alzheimer's patients participate without getting frustrated at 
tasks that are too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to bring out whatever is left in people," said Lolo Sarnoff, a 
73-year-old retired scientist and active sculptor who created Arts for the 
Aging. "You have to be a little bit more patient, a little bit more repetitive, 
but they will do some very beautiful things." 
</P>
<P>
Working with the arts has a "soothing effect" on the Alzheimer's patients and 
reduces their agitation, even though the classes soon may be forgotten because 
of memory impairment, Sarnoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are incredibly happy when they can accomplish something, but you don't 
expect that they will remember. We just live in the moment with them." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rooney, a painter and art teacher who is Arts for the Aging's program 
director, said many patients learn and progress during workshops, although some 
may never master drawing even the basic border that is the first step in his 
classes. "One student makes Jackson Pollock-type scribbling throughout the 
class period, then holds it up with a sweet smile to ask, 'Is this what you 
wanted?' " 
</P>
<P>
Rooney is fascinated with the work of eccentrics such as Pollock and Vincent 
van Gogh and sees Arts for the Aging as an opportunity to study that art in 
progress. "I personally respond to their art because it is very honest. It's 
not contrived in any way." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2.5 million to 3 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the 
most common cause of severe intellectual impairment in older people. The 
numbers are expected to mushroom as the nation's population ages. 
</P>
<P>
At first, individuals may experience only subtle changes in memory. But as the 
disease progresses, it can cause serious forgetfulness, confusion, irritability 
and changes in personality and judgment that leave patients unable to care for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Bodil Meleney, a sculptor and part-time executive director of Arts for the 
Aging, said it is one of many support systems that family members need as they 
struggle with the daily demands of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"We fit in as a small cog in the whole thing. The artwork seems to calm them 
down. They are pleased with what they have done." 
</P>
<P>
Sarnoff started Arts for the Aging "like everything else in my life -- by 
mistake." She said she happened to answer the telephone at the Art Barn, a 
community-run art gallery, when the National Institutes of Health called six 
years ago seeking someone to teach an art class for Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
That pilot program was so well received that she began organizing similar 
workshops from the Art Barn, and last year she created a separate nonprofit 
organization "dedicated to enhancing the lives of the aging through art." 
</P>
<P>
Arts for the Aging, financed entirely by private grants and donations, 
celebrated its first anniversary with a gala benefit late last year at the West 
German Embassy that featured an exhibit of artwork by Alzheimer's patients.

SCHEDULES FOR YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS TO BE WORKED OUT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A SCHEDULE TO EASE OVERCROWDING IN HAWTHORNE SCHOOLS IS SET TO BEGIN 
IN JULY. BUT SOME PARENTS HAVE DISTRIBUTED A PETITION SEEKING A DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Hawthorne School District will consider Monday how to schedule a year-round 
program that will start this July to help ease overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say year-round schooling is the only way to deal with the 
surge in attendance in recent years, which has forced them to place 39 portable 
classrooms in playgrounds throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which employs about 260 teachers, has seven elementary schools 
and two intermediate schools. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the district approved the year-round session, but it did not 
decide how the new school year would be structured. Officials said last week 
that the district's Board of Trustees will most likely favor a plan in which 
schools are in session for 60 days and out for 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
However, opposition is expected. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of 14 parents who say they were not given enough warning circulated 
a petition; it requested that the district delay the schedule change to give 
parents time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of school officials, enrollment in the district began rising 
significantly two years ago. In September, 1988, enrollment jumped 6% to 5,280, 
district officials said. It increased an additional 8% the following September, 
to 5,700. By this January, enrollment was up an additional 10% to 6,270. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Amato, vice president of the Ramona Elementary School PTA and leader of 
the parents committee, said her group is asking that the district delay the 
year-round schedule for one year. 
</P>
<P>
She said the petition has between 800 and 1,000 signatures. Amato said the 
parents who have signed it are also upset because the district did not ask 
parents to help study alternatives to alleviate overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're outraged because we were not made part of this decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Uribe, president of the Hawthorne Intermediate School PTA, said she 
signed the petition because "we should have been informed a lot sooner." 
</P>
<P>
She said she thinks the decision to implement year-round schooling has caught 
many parents by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Although parents were not brought in to help decide how to address the 
overcrowding problem, Ida Alba, director of personnel, said the district 
notified parents that it was considering a year-round schedule in the July, 
1988, newsletter mailed to parents. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district has since published other newsletters and has held 
meetings on the issue with PTAs during the intervening 18 months. "We really 
have tried" to inform parents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment is increasing so fast that the district cannot afford to delay the 
schedule change much longer, said Pamela Fees, director of business services. 
</P>
<P>
Fees said the 60/20 calendar would reduce by 25% the number of students in 
attendance at one time. She said the calendar has the same number of school 
days -- 180 -- and would not disrupt most regular holiday vacations, such as 
Thanksgiving, Christmas and Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the 60/20 calendar would place students in one of four separate 
schedule tracks, three of which are in session while one is on vacation. 
Parents would be asked to choose the track they prefer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fees said the district has studied other alternatives and has tried other ways 
of alleviating the overcrowding, such as realigning school boundaries. But she 
said the district has determined that the year-round school is the only 
workable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Amato said many parents did not receive the earlier newsletters. She said she 
learned in May, 1989 -- not 1988 -- that the district was considering 
year-round schooling. If the district does not delay the schedule change, she 
said her committee will consider seeking a legal injunction. 
</P>
<P>
If all else fails, she said her group will try to recall the entire Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there was effort to cover this up until it was too late to do 
anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Parks and Recreation Director Robert Klein said it is unclear how 
well the city's recreational programs will fit in with the proposed schedule. 
City park and recreation officials have met once with school officials to 
discuss the year-round schedule, but Klein said specific details about how to 
accommodate the two programs will be discussed when the district settles on a 
year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that it is "pretty difficult to reschedule after you have been 
established." Uribe said she thinks most parents are not opposed to year-round 
schooling but simply want more time to study the plan. "I knew it was coming, 
but I had expected us to be more informed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rosemarie Caldwell said the district has made every effort to 
contact parents. She said she is not sure why some parents have signed the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, what can you do . . . you can never make 100% of the people happy," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Steffen, president of the 220-member Hawthorne Elementary Teachers Assn., 
said the association has not officially endorsed the year-round plan, but he 
said he thinks a majority of the teachers have accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
Steffen said most teachers believe the district has worked hard to study the 
year-round schooling plan, as well as other ways to handle to the enrollment 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jacobson, principal of Ramona Elementary School, said he has received a few 
phone calls in the last two weeks from parents who were concerned about the 
year-round school plan. But he said that after he explained how the schedule 
works most parents seemed to accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"When I present the facts, (some parents said) 'Well, I didn't know that,' " he 
said.

REFLECTIONS: 'SEEING THIS HORSE WITH ALL HIS PROBLEMS, SEEING HIM GO RIGHT, 
THAT'S MY REWARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

As a masseur at the La Costa Spa for men, Don Childs spends his days kneading 
and pounding the backs of affluent clients. In his spare time, the 40-year-old 
Vista resident is similarly occupied, but then it's on horses. For 10 years, 
Childs has been performing shiatsu -- a Japanese form of acupressure -- on 
horses, mostly thoroughbreds and jumpers. Although his unorthodox methods have 
met with resistance from veterinarians and horse trainers, Childs says what 
works on humans can work on horses, and vice versa. The Chicago native has been 
doing massage on humans for nearly 20 years, and his work with horses has taken 
him all over Europe and across this country as well. Times staff writer 
Caroline Lemke interviewed Childs at the Rancho Sante Fe Riding Club, and 
Barbara Martin Pinhero photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I had never been around a horse until 1974. I was working at La Costa as a 
masseur for men, and a gentleman from Atlanta wanted me to go back with him to 
continue his program. I went to Atlanta for what was supposed to be three 
months and wound up staying five years. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he had a daughter with a pony, and I would go with her to the stables 
every day. Then I went to shows with her. We went to one show where they had 
the horses jumping big fences, and, watching that, I decided right then and 
there that show jumping was what I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
From Atlanta, I went to the Yorkshire Riding Center in England so I could learn 
how to jump and ride. I had to take care of an event horse. He was difficult; 
he had a problem with his back. I had been a masseur before, so I thought, 
"Hell, we've got to do something to calm him down." So I started massaging his 
back, using shiatsu and different methods, and I saw the horse responding. 
</P>
<P>
After England, I went to Belgium and worked as a groom. There were some very 
difficult horses there, and I found different ways of calming them down. I do 
some strange things, but it gets results. 
</P>
<P>
I look at the expression on the horse's face and see if I can find the problem. 
With Michael here, you can see how tight his face is; he has these depressions 
around his eyes. That means the energy that travels in channels throughout his 
body is not able to make a complete cycle from front to back. I have to be able 
to trace each channel and find where the block is, the muscle spasm that is 
squeezing the channel. I have to relax that particular area so the energy can 
flow freely again. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I've got to do is get the energy flowing. In order to do that, 
I need to add a little more into the horse's system. I do this through 
extension. I bring up some earth energy and mix it with some cosmic energy, and 
I bring the two energies into the horse and mix it counterclockwise. 
</P>
<P>
When there is no energy flowing, the slightest touch burns. It's like pouring 
hot water on them. Horses learn to live with it, they have a pretty high pain 
tolerance. But I do a little work on them at a time, then allow them to heal. 
Once the horse is aware of what's going on, he'll heal himself. 
</P>
<P>
It's funny. One day I was here, working on two horses at once because I was in 
a hurry, and I had my eyes closed. I heard someone say, "What's he doing?" It 
was two little ladies standing here, and one of them answered, "Well, I don't 
know, but it certainly looks ungodly." 
</P>
<P>
I found that horses actually communicate through mental telepathy. I'll be 
working a horse and do something and wonder why I did it. After a while, the 
horse will tell you where he hurts. One horse I was working with pinned me 
against the wall and wouldn't let me out until I found the exact place where he 
was hurting. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting because you can run into some problem on a human and you've 
already had the same problem on a horse. It works the opposite, too. Horses 
have taught me a lot. I'm still learning. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing this horse with all his problems, seeing him go right, that's my reward. 
Seeing him comfortable, seeing him happy and not miserable anymore.

ANOTHER AREA HOSPITAL ASKS TO TREAT FEWER EMERGENCIES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: OFFICIALS SAY NON-PAYING PATIENTS ARE COSTING GARDENA'S MEMORIAL 
HOSPITAL TOO MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial Hospital of Gardena has submitted a request to county health officials 
to downgrade its emergency room status, a move that would stop paramedics from 
bringing emergency cases to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the request was made because it is costing them too 
much to care for non-paying emergency cases. "It's the huge burden of 
uncompensated care that's forcing us to make this change," said hospital 
administrator George Rooth. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's emergency room has become overwhelmed by the growing number of 
patients brought to its facilities from outside the Gardena area. As more 
trauma centers and emergency rooms close countywide, the hospital has received 
increasing numbers of patients from greater distances, Rooth said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the request would downgrade the private 200-bed facility from 
paramedic receiving status to standby status, probably in February, hospital 
officials said. Emergency services would still be available for walk-ins and 
some private ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the Gardena hospital receives about 300 paramedic runs a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena city officials, concerned about the effect the curtailment will have on 
emergency services for Gardena residents, are planning to meet with county 
health officials Jan. 29, said City Manager Kenneth Landau. Officials will 
discuss ways to try to keep the emergency room open for residents of the 
immediate Gardena area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first cutback at the Gardena hospital because of patient 
payment problems. Last June, the Gardena hospital stopped accepting Medi-Cal 
patients, saying reimbursement procedures were cumbersome and reimbursement 
rates were so low that they were causing the facility to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to downgrade its license, the Gardena hospital is following the lead 
of Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, which closed its emergency 
room doors to paramedic patients last May. Countywide, other hospitals, 
including Beverly Hills Medical Center, have made similar requests recently. 
</P>
<P>
The two South Bay hospitals that will continue to provide emergency services in 
the area surrounding Gardena -- north of Redondo Beach Boulevard -- are Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne and Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Emergency Medical Services Commission discussed the Gardena 
hospital's request at a meeting last week, said Barbara Pavey, head of 
operations and monitoring for the EMS agency of the county's Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know yet what the impact will be," if the request is granted, 
Pavey said. "We're in the process of evaluating that question. . . . 
Three-hundred runs a month is not a large number compared to bigger hospitals, 
but it's still 300 runs that will have to be redistributed." 
</P>
<P>
County officials must make a recommendation to the state before a licensing 
change is approved, Pavey said. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Bantle, vice president for nursing services at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital, said that, although she could not accurately estimate how much more 
paramedic traffic would go to her hospital should Memorial Hospital's request 
be approved, an increase seems inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
After Centinela shut its paramedic services last year, there was "a noticeable 
increase" in the number of paramedic patients transported to Daniel Freeman, 
Bantle said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Daniel Freeman only recently found out about Memorial Hospital's 
request to downgrade and have not had time to examine what the effect may be on 
the hospital's staff and budget, Bantle said. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept paramedic traffic, and we certainly want to continue doing that," 
said Bantle, adding that "finances are certainly a concern for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Gardena hospital is farther away than Centinela in relation to 
Daniel Freeman, Bantle said the closing of its paramedic services may leave 
fewer referral options for Daniel Freeman's base station, from which hospital 
officials radio paramedics with information about available emergency beds. 
</P>
<P>
"With fewer facilities trying to take care of the same number of patients, 
you're going to have an increase somewhere," Bantle said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, about 10 Los Angeles County hospitals have downgraded 
or shut down paramedic services, and another 10 have closed trauma centers, 
said David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, an association of 225 private and public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It has reached a crisis stage," Langness said. "Each time a trauma center 
closes or a paramedic center chooses to 'down-license,' it makes access to care 
that much more difficult in an emergency situation, when you need the most 
rapid access."

TORRANCE STUDENTS CHEER DIVERSITY;

<P>
EDUCATION: WEST HIGH SCHOOL SHOWS OFF ITS RICH BLEND OF CULTURES DURING A WEEK 
HIGHLIGHTING HOMELAND TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Titters filled the West High School library as students twisted in their 
chairs, casting questioning glances at classmates on the sidelines who were 
decked out in fancy costumes that glistened with color. 
</P>
<P>
Their giggles gave way to admiring smiles as two Hungarian students twirled 
through a traditional folk dance. Other classmates read a poem in nine 
languages about cultural understanding, and the president of the school's Club 
International performed an exotic dance wearing an ornate costume from her 
native India. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are accustomed to hearing lunchtime conversations conducted in 
everything from Hindi and Persian to Korean and Japanese, students said they 
had not truly realized how diverse their Torrance campus has become. 
</P>
<P>
That was exactly the point of Cultural Diversity Week, said Club International 
President Sona Saha. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been excellent," said Saha, 16, her face and head gleaming with the 
garnets, emeralds, pearls and diamonds of her traditional dance jewelry. "We 
have so many kids from so many different cultures; we just wanted to show them 
what everyone has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Saha, who moved to the United States from India when she was 8, speaks five 
languages fluently, including English without a trace of an accent, and picked 
up "a little Danish" as an exchange student to Denmark last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, West High School students would have been hard-pressed to 
put on any kind of cultural show. 
</P>
<P>
Back when Margaret Harrell, now the supervisor of the campus Asian Cultural 
Club, began teaching at the school in 1972, its students were "solid 
blue-collar white," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly half of West High's 1,625 students are members of minority groups. 
Assistant Principal Dick Rose said that figure should surpass the 50% mark next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in the school's English as a Second Language program has grown from 
a dozen students in 1972 to 183 today, representing 64 different countries and 
more than 40 different languages. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had really significant changes, and that is one of the main reasons we 
give the time to things like this," Harrell said. "We want to be sure that, 
instead of hearing, 'These are the outsiders and we're being threatened,' that 
we view it as, 'Isn't this great? We're joining the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael Simek, 17, whose family emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Sacramento 
five years ago, said he has thrived in West High's diverse ethnic environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to travel a lot, and this is like traveling for free," he said. "You 
learn so much from everyone. . . . This would never happen in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
For most students, however, culture is rarely an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We just all hang around together," said Nathan Spann, 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you know, he's one of my best friends," he said, gesturing toward an 
Asian boy standing nearby. Asked whether the friend was Chinese, Japanese or 
Korean, Spann frowned. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "Does it matter?"

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year, five years after Congress created a national holiday on Jan. 15 to 
commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, only four of 29 Orange County 
cities -- and the county itself -- have officially recognized the day and its 
meaning. At the rate additional cities join in, it will be well into the 21st 
Century before the holiday is given its just due. 
</P>
<P>
Congress made the birthday of the slain civil rights leader a holiday because 
he stood for justice and equality for all races. Those who lived through the 
days when King led nonviolent demonstrations to force the white society to come 
face to face with its own racism will never forget the role this eloquent and 
peaceful man played in national change. But, while the most virulent forms of 
racism have disappeared, there are still gains to be made for blacks in 
America, and in Orange County. As an indication of the non-acceptance of blacks 
here, their numbers have remained virtually stagnant for a decade, still 
numbering less than 30,000 of a population of more than 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Martin Luther King Day is not just for blacks. It also represents 
the struggle for equality of all people who come to America in search of 
freedom. In Orange County, this includes large communities of Vietnamese 
refugees and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Seal Beach added Martin Luther King Day to its list of employee 
holidays. The year before, Santa Ana joined the cities of Irvine and Huntington 
Beach, as well as Orange County, to celebrate the symbolic day. During this 
coming year, other cities should join with them so that, well before the turn 
of the century, it is a holiday observed by all in Orange County.

PARK'S TRAFFIC IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, is expecting federal government assistance 
to build roads and solve traffic problems in Anaheim or Long Beach before he 
can consent to building a new Disneyland Park. 
</P>
<P>
This is a charming idea. Since we in Orange County are unable to find federal 
money to solve our existing freeway problems, Eisner, if successful in 
obtaining federal money, might consider sharing Disneyland profits -- so we can 
solve our traffic problems.

CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN POLICE SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past 11 1/2 years, there have been more than 150 people shot by the 
police in Orange County and not one officer has been found guilty of any 
wrongdoing or prosecuted by the district attorney. As long as his staff of 
investigators continues to justify every single case involving police officers, 
any reduction in police shooting is unlikely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the police agencies are switching from the standard six-shot revolver 
to rapid-fire, 9-millimeter semiautomatics, which have two to three time the 
firing capacity. 
</P>
<P>
With all the millions of dollars in lawsuits charging the police with excessive 
force, I doubt that increasing their firepower using weapons that can fire up 
to 19 rounds in a matter of seconds is going to reduce the rash of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
There have been far too many cases where unarmed suspects have been shot or 
killed here in Orange County. I think it's time that responsible non-police 
citizens get involved in some of these shooting investigations where unarmed 
people have been shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
How could the police be justified in shooting unarmed people in every single 
case? Don't they carry batons or Mace? Why all the shooting? 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County citizens were involved in some of these shooting 
investigations, the number of shooting incidents would be reduced and there 
wouldn't be all these millions of dollars in lawsuits.

COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
IN JAIL CRUNCH, COUNTY MUST REVIEW OPTIONS OTHER THAN MORE CAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY N. PONTELL, Henry Pontell is a sociologist who teaches and conducts 
research at UC Irvine. He is completing a study of jail overcrowding in 
California and has written works on criminal-justice, white-collar-crime and 
punishment issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jail overcrowding in Orange County continues to be a significant social problem 
as we move into the 1990s. It became a major challenge for local policy-makers 
in 1978, when the county and the sheriff were ordered by a federal court judge 
to reduce crowding in the main jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Board of Supervisors and the sheriff were held in contempt by the 
same federal judge for failing to comply with his 7-year-old order. Since then, 
the situation either has become worse or has not improved, depending how one 
looks at it. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed solution of adding jail cells at enormous taxpayer expense has 
divided the county into warring "NIMBY" (Not in My Back Yard) groups, causing 
unnecessary litigation, wasted time and additional cost, and has accomplished 
very little toward relieving jail overcrowding. In fact, the taxpayer expense 
is considerably more than the public is probably aware of, because the immense 
original construction cost doubles every seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The most recently suggested idea of joining Riverside County in building a 
regional jail in the desert, which would eliminate the need for the 6,700-bed 
facility planned for Gypsum Canyon, may, if nothing else, demonstrate that the 
best political strategy regarding the jail issue is "out of sight, out of 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
While the Orange County Board of Supervisors has focused its attention (and 
ours) on building new facilities as the panacea to jail overcrowding, efforts 
to resolve the problem could be moved in a different direction that would 
result in more serious thinking and realistic expectations regarding the use of 
punishment resources and the enhancement of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Before embarking on a dramatic jail construction program, a detailed and 
balanced examination must be made not only of the incredible economic 
consequences, but also of other sentencing methods (for example, expanding and 
initiating such mechanisms as work furlough, community service, electronic 
monitoring and intensive supervision, to name but a few promising ones) and 
better coordination in the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The county simply cannot afford not to employ and expand on such alternatives 
to incarceration with selected offenders -- unless, of course, taxpayers come 
up with the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to provide extensive 
incarceration. Even so, such extensive incarceration would come with no 
guarantee of an actual reduction in crime; in fact, the opposite has held true, 
as increasing incarceration rates have been accompanied by higher crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the county has been denied state funding for failing to adequately 
develop and detail such creative, alternative proposals ("sent back to do their 
homework," as one official reported). It is such tunnel vision regarding 
punishment policy that has helped turn efforts to relieve overcrowding in the 
county into a political and financial fiasco, with the ultimate costs thrust on 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The first "radical" idea that must be injected into policy proposals is that 
the jail cannot and should not be considered as a separate entity in criminal 
justice, but rather as inexorably tied to other institutions, most notably 
courts and police. "Solutions" to overcrowding that focus alone on absolute 
capacity or the number of jail cells are thus doomed to failure from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Second, there must be strong leadership at both the county and state level to 
produce detailed criminal justice management proposals; thorough examination of 
the use of existing resources; a commitment to innovative sentencing options 
and their expansion when successful, and an increase in interagency cooperation 
and coordination among criminal justice agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Having a broad-based commission to produce such proposals is a much better 
route than continuing to allow the system to slowly self-destruct, leaving 
justice by the wayside for victims and defendants and spending hundreds of 
millions of taxpayer dollars on a non-solution to crime. 
</P>
<P>
This leads to a final point on which there already is a considerable degree of 
expert consensus: Serious attention to prevention and education will go a lot 
further in reducing crime than will incarcerating criminals. 
</P>
<P>
A crisis mentality regarding jail overcrowding will do more harm than good, 
both fiscally and socially, and should be abandoned. Only then will 
policy-makers be able to seriously consider crime and its punishment -- and 
develop effective long-term policies.

DISNEY-BASHING AND THE DISNEY GROOMING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here we go again with another round of Disney-bashing over its grooming policy, 
the "Disney Look." It is quite obvious that The Times and its readers who 
oppose the Disney Look are not aware of the Disney organization, its policies 
and its philosophies. Let's set a few facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney was not an employee of Walt Disney Attractions, the division that 
operates the theme parks in Anaheim, Orlando, Tokyo, and, soon, Paris. 
Therefore, he was not covered by the Disney Look. Any Disney character 
possessing facial hair is not an employee of Walt Disney Attractions; they are 
copyrighted characters owned by the Walt Disney Co. The persons performing the 
roles of these characters comply with the Disney Look because they are 
employees of Walt Disney Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Look is a clean-cut, natural look that does not divert the guests' 
attention away from the park as would long hair, facial hair, heavy makeup, 
excessive jewelry and any extreme appearance. One need not get paranoid over 
who will be targeted next, as one reader expressed about the future of men with 
thinning hair. The Disney Look does not prohibit natural baldness; it does 
prohibit shaved heads. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Look works. It is one reason Disneyland has changed the image of 
amusement parks from that of dirty places operated by surly personnel to that 
of a clean place staffed by courteous, well-groomed employees. Now it can even 
be said to be their trademark look. Throughout the years that the policy has 
been in effect, the quality of the employees has not diminished, and the 
reputation of Disney has been unsurpassed by its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposing the Disney Look always complain that Disney should get with the 
times, but a time-proven idea such as this is far superior to the alternative, 
me-first, do-as-I-please attitude that prevails today among many people. This 
non-offensive, timeless standard demands the best from each employee, and that 
in turn has helped more than one-half billion guests enjoy their visits to the 
Disney theme parks.

HOMEOWNERS, CHARITY AND SHARE OUR SELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to "The Plight of SOS Center in Costa Mesa" by Sylvia 
Easton and others (Letters, Jan. 14). Easton (and others in other articles) 
accuses Costa Mesa of cruelty and greed. 
</P>
<P>
That simply is not true. The problem is the number of people SOS brings to a 
residential area of Costa Mesa, causing distress to the residents. This was not 
a problem when the organization was smaller and would not be a problem if the 
number of people attracted to the organization in this area was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest a solution: The rest of the 29 cities in Orange County should each 
open a branch of SOS. Surely, if, as Easton suggests, many of Irvine's homeless 
have been assisted by SOS, Irvine should not be reluctant in participating in 
such a humane activity. Besides, why should the homeless of other cities have 
to go all the way to Costa Mesa to obtain aid? 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Easton, as chair of Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, 
should be in an excellent position to assist SOS in opening a branch office. It 
is unfortunate that her only option seems to be in browbeating a Costa Mesa 
neighborhood into accepting the responsibility of other cities.

<P>
There were 1,000 "unselfish" people at the SOS rally on Jan. 13. I'm sure most 
of those people are for keeping SOS at the Rea Community Center in West Side 
Costa Mesa. It draws the homeless, the parolees and alcoholics away from their 
safe, quiet and "unselfish" neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
We, in our small, "selfish" little neighborhood, are but a small voice trying 
to be heard over the great uproar of the richer who employ many West Side 
residents; the many Orange County churches involved; the tilted media coverage; 
and Jean Forbath and other SOS directors -- the most "unselfish" of all, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that if some of these other more "unselfish" areas of the county 
had not closed their facilities or would put their action and money where their 
mouth and heart literally are, at home, we in our "selfish" little neighborhood 
would not be so desperate to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
I'm for keeping this type of organization out of all those "unselfish" 
residential neighborhoods, fearing they may become "selfish." We know how 
quickly the Mesa Verde neighborhood of Costa Mesa seemed almost to act 
"selfish" when mention was made to move there. That is Forbath's own 
neighborhood -- forbid! 
</P>
<P>
A man signed our petition Saturday who did not live in West Side Costa Mesa. He 
thought maybe he should not. I asked if he was for residential neighborhoods 
being safe and quiet. He was! I told him that he could sign, that perhaps SOS 
might have some signatures from outside West Side Costa Mesa also. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to commend this "heartless" Costa Mesa City Council and citizenry 
for listening with wisdom and compassion to fellow citizens and not bowing to 
outside financial, religious and "unselfish" pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone says the homeless will not go away. I believe this also. I just want 
them to disperse from in front of my home and allow the whole country to show 
how "unselfish" it is.

FEAR OF FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to correct a misconception expressed in Patrick Flynn's letter 
(Dec. 31) in which he mistakenly concluded that UCI Medical Center has a 
counselor who treats flying anxieties while "higher priority" needs, i.e., drug 
addiction, are neglected. It was an unfortunate misunderstanding on his part of 
the original article that appeared on Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
I am the UCI counselor referred to in Mr. Flynn's letter, and I can assure him 
and any other readers who may also have misunderstood that the counseling and 
social work staff at UCIMC devote their energies to treating critical medical 
problems of patients and their families, including patients whose medical 
condition is complicated by drug dependence and addiction. 
</P>
<P>
The information contained in the article referred to by Mr. Flynn was 
voluntarily contributed as a public service for holiday air travelers. It is 
not part of any "luxury" services provided by the Medical Center with public 
funds. There is no cost to the university for the acquisition or dissemination 
of such information, and any individuals wishing treatment for air-travel 
anxieties are referred to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
It's helpful for readers like Mr. Flynn to keep in mind that any major 
university has on staff numerous experts with wide-ranging interests. These 
individuals typically welcome opportunities to freely share their knowledge 
with the greater community, which was the intent of the original article. The 
sharing of such knowledge is one of the many benefits of having a major 
university in the community.

ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT'S $1-MILLION PUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent article (Jan. 15) regarding the purchase of new pumps and valves to 
speed the collection of storm water runoff missed the mark. 
</P>
<P>
To imply that the Orange County Water District bought equipment based on an 
error-filled report misleads the public into thinking that a poor public policy 
decision was made by the district's staff and board. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth. The district made a decision to select 
this equipment from one manufacturer in keeping with sound public policy based 
on saving the public money. Timely installation of the pumps during the rainy 
season can potentially save the district hundreds of thousands of dollars by 
capturing high-quality storm runoff from the Santa Ana River. The errors in the 
decision report were minor, inadvertent and inconsequential. They had no 
bearing on the decision to select the pumps. The manufacturer is the industry 
leader in constructing a complicated piece of equipment, critical to the 
efficient operation of the district. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for competitors to second-guess and complain about not being 
selected for a particular piece of work, and this seems to be what happened 
here. Orange County Water District enjoys a national reputation for innovation 
based on good public policy to provide ample high-quality water at the lowest 
possible price. The decision to select these pumps and valves is consistent 
with this policy.

CLIPPERS USE ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rookie, the recuperating and the reject won a game for the Clippers 
Saturday night, as they rallied to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves, 97-95, at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed Benoit Benjamin with 16 rebounds, 15 points and six 
blocked shots; Charles Smith and Danny Manning with 24 points each, and Gary 
Grant with 17 assists and three free throws in the final 11.9 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But the real heroes were as unlikely as the game in which the Clippers came 
from 14 points down to win for the eighth time in 11 outings. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Jeff Martin, growing in stature with each game, took an out-of-bounds 
lob pass from Manning and, without coming down, laid in the winning basket with 
2.7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Garrick, who missed the last two games with tendinitis in his left knee, 
played only six minutes but had back-to-back steals midway through the third 
quarter that sparked the go-ahead rally. 
</P>
<P>
Former Laker David Rivers, cut by the Timberwolves in training camp, also 
provided a spark off the bench in the second half. On his 25th birthday, he had 
two points and four rebounds in 12 minutes, but, as Coach Don Casey said, "I 
thought Rivers and Garrick set the tone tonight with their defense." 
</P>
<P>
Added Rivers, who said playing Minnesota didn't provide any extra motivation: 
"I just see it as a challenge. I feel I'm capable of having a positive impact. 
I just waited for an opportunity, and tonight I took advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
But it came down to Martin, who, with the Clippers holding a 92-90 advantage, 
had defended Tony Campbell (27 points) one-on-one and forced Campbell into a 
crucial traveling call. 
</P>
<P>
After Randy Breuer hit a short hook in the lane with 9.2seconds left to bring 
Minnesota within a basket, Grant missed one of two free throws with 7.6 seconds 
on the clock. Minnesota inbounded from midcourt and Scott Roth's pass found Tod 
Murphy in the right corner for a three-pointer that tied the score, 95-95, with 
3.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers called time out, and Manning took the ball at halfcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for an open man, he lofted a pass at a tough angle, practically over 
the basket. Martin, having gotten behind Campbell, was there, and he completed 
the lob play with a soft bank before Breuer could help on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Manning threw a perfect pass. The execution on the receiving end 
was, apparently, slightly less. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if I had dunked it," Martin said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (18-19) used a 30-9 run over 13 minutes 19 seconds of the third 
and fourth quarters to get in position to win, holding Minnesota to 39 points 
in the second half. When time out was called with 6:27 to play, they had turned 
the double-digit deficit into an 81-74 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Garrick's role was most evident in two consecutive Minnesota possessions in the 
third quarter, both steals. Largely because of it, the Clipper deficit went 
from 65-59 to 65-63. 
</P>
<P>
Consider it six minutes that helped the Clippers climb into a fourth-place tie 
with Seattle in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt really good," Garrick said of being back in the lineup. "Six minutes 
isn't the amount I would have liked to play -- I would have liked a lot more -- 
but I did all I could to contribute to the win." 
</P>
<P>
Which, which combined with the other backcourt reserves and the usual stars, 
was enough. Barely, but enough. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ainge's name is already being tossed around in trade rumors, but General 
Manager Elgin Baylor, while refusing to even comment on interest regarding the 
Sacramento guard, said no deal is imminent to replace Ron Harper. As much as 
anything, the Clipper staff sees this as a time to show confidence in the other 
players and also give some of the lesser-used a chance to impress. "Let's see 
what we've got first," Baylor said. "Let's get some of the players additional 
minutes and see if someone steps up to soften the blow. Now is a chance for 
guys like Michael Young and Jeff Martin to show their talent." As an example of 
good impressions that can come out of an otherwise troubling situation, Baylor 
points to the development of Ken Norman two years ago when fellow rookies 
Reggie Williams and Joe Wolf were sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Don Casey's first day as Clipper 
coach, although he was actually named to replace Gene Shue Jan. 19. "First, I 
remember how quickly it's gone," Casey said. "Secondly, how far we've come in a 
year." . . . Harper returned home to Ohio Saturday, his 26th birthday, in 
preparation for surgery Tuesday on his right knee.

It was a day of upsets in college basketball, as six of the top seven teams 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
The only team to survive was No. 4 Missouri, which defeated top-ranked Kansas. 
No. 2 Georgetown was upset by unranked Connecticut, No. 3 Oklahoma fell to No. 
23 Arizona, No. 5 Syracuse was beaten by Providence, No. 6 Michigan lost to 
Iowa and No. 7 Illinois lost to No. 24 Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
The upsets began at Columbia, Mo., where the Tigers, who trailed by as many as 
nine points in the first half, came back to defeat Kansas, 95-87. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime there were a lot of sad faces," said Missouri's Anthony Peeler, 
who scored 24 points. "But we just talked about treating them as just another 
team." 
</P>
<P>
It was the 26th consecutive victory at home for the Tigers (17-1 overall, 4-0 
in the Big Eight), who made 18 of 29 shots in the second half. It is also the 
second consecutive season that the Tigers have defeated a top-ranked team on 
their home court. They beat then-No. 1 Oklahoma, 97-84, last February. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks (19-1, 2-1) led, 46-43, at halftime, but the Tigers scored the 
first six points of the second half and took the lead for good with 17 minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Brown brought Kansas to within 67-65 with 10:44 remaining. The Jayhawks 
pulled to within two points of the lead on three more occasions, the last time 
at 77-75. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith scored 23 points for Kansas, 19 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut 70, No. 2 Georgetown 65 -- The Hoyas, the only undefeated 
major-college team after Kansas was beaten earlier in the day, lost when the 
Huskies connected on seven of eight free throws in the final 1:04 for a Big 
East Conference victory at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (15-3, 5-2) broke a 60-60 tie with 3:46 left on a three-point 
basket by Nadav Henefeld and never trailed again. The Hoyas (14-1, 4-1) got as 
close as 63-62, and made it 67-65 on a three-point basket by Mark Tillmon with 
32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies held the Hoyas scoreless for the first 7:03 and had a 14-0 lead 
before Alonzo Mourning, who had 23 points, scored on a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Arizona 78, No. 3 Oklahoma 74 -- The Sooners had shooting troubles all 
day against the Wildcats. But in the end, it was the shot the third-ranked 
Sooners didn't take that gave the Wildcats the victory at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit Holmes cost the Sooners (12-2) a chance at the tying basket when he lost 
the ball out-of-bounds with four seconds left. The Wildcats' Sean Rooks was 
fouled one second later and hit two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats limited the high-scoring Sooners to seven-for-28 shooting in the 
first half and 24-for-69 for the game. The Sooners, who lost Tuesday to Kansas 
State, last lost consecutive games two years ago -- to Louisiana State and 
Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
Providence 87, No. 5 Syracuse 86 -- Junior guard Eric Murdock made a jump shot 
from the foul line with four seconds to play and the Friars defeated the 
Orangemen for the first time in 11 years in a Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 86-85, the Orangemen's Dave Johnson missed the the first free throw of 
a one-and-one with 33 seconds remaining. After Murdock's shot, Richard Manning 
of the Orangemen missed a short jumper in the lane as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars (11-4, 4-2), led by Murdock's 25 points and 16 assists, ended more 
than a decade of futility against the Orangemen (12-3, 3-3), who had won 21 in 
a row from the Friars since the league was formed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 78, No. 6 Michigan 76 -- Les Jepsen scored 13 of his 19 points in the 
second half and sank the winning free throws in overtime as the Hawkeyes 
overcame a 15-point deficit to stun the Wolverines in a Big Ten game at Iowa 
City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes (9-6, 1-4) broke a five-game losing streak. The Wolverines are 
13-3, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal Robinson, who scored 22 of his 28 points for the Wolverines in the first 
half, drove the length of the court but missed a flying, off-balance layup at 
the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ingram's layup with 39 seconds left in regulation gave Iowa a 71-71 tie 
and capped a 24-9 run in which the Hawkeyes rallied from a 62-47 deficit with 
11:24 left. The Wolverines had a 44-33 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bullard led the Hawkeyes with 23 points. Terry Mills scored 15 points for 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Purdue 81, No. 7 Illinois 68 -- At West Lafayette, Ind., the 
Boilermakers turned a 17-2 second-half run into a runaway to remain undefeated 
in Big Ten play while beating a higher-ranked team for the third time in their 
last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (13-2, 4-0) scored the first four points of the game and never was 
caught, taking a 17-7 lead in the first eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini (13-3, 3-3) trailed by 12 points with 14:43 left when the 
Boilermakers put the game out of reach by scoring 10 consecutive points and 
then adding another seven for a 21-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Gill scored 23 points for the Illini. Marcus Liberty, the Illini's 
leading scorer, was eight of 18 shots.

DOWNSIZING AMERICA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON B. KUTLER, JON B. KUTLER is a vice president and head of the Los Angeles 
office of Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., an investment banking firm. A former 
U.S. Navy lieutenant, he is responsible for the firm's relations with aerospace 
and defense clients. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. this month announced a major change in corporate strategy by 
choosing to sell its Ford Aerospace unit and exit the defense business. The 
move followed a similar announcement a month earlier by Chrysler to sell its 
aerospace operation. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves recognize a growing problem that, if not adequately dealt with by 
other defense contractors, could result in serious harm to our military 
production capabilities, aerospace work force and technological 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, in a nutshell, is that there are simply too many defense companies 
chasing too little defense business. If companies don't merge or initiate 
creative joint ventures to proactively reduce capacity in the near term, they 
will be further weakened by their debt loads at a loss to shareholders and 
employees. In the interim they need to maximize use of their existing assets by 
improving cash flow. This includes selling unproductive assets, such as real 
estate, that aren't part of their basic businesses, reviewing options for 
pension overfunding and aggressively managing working capital. 
</P>
<P>
If not, as the stock market overreacts to "peace breaking out" by rapidly 
pushing down the value of defense stocks, there may be a window of 
vulnerability to takeovers of defense firms through leveraged buyouts, as has 
recently been the case in other consolidating industries such as retailing or 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
After years of serving the country well, a haphazard breakup of the industry 
wouldn't be good for our overall defense posture or for U.S. technological 
innovation, which relies a great deal on the work of our defense firms. Many 
products or advances such as composite materials, digital communications, 
lasers, advanced electronics and space systems trace an important part of their 
technological roots to military programs. 
</P>
<P>
Why is there not enough business to go around? 
</P>
<P>
The defense business has always been cyclical. But reduced tensions in the 
Eastern Bloc and continued high U.S. budget deficits have resulted in pressures 
to cut the American defense budget on a longer-term basis. As budgets decrease 
and current order backlogs work off, as they will in the 1990s, a large number 
of defense firms may have to get out of the business, and the ones that remain 
will face an extremely challenging contracting environment. 
</P>
<P>
Even if budgets were stable, there would be overcapacity. That is because the 
nature of our defense programs is vastly different from a decade ago. Today, 
military programs have become more complex in design and smaller in number. 
Whereas in the past we would build five planes or five missiles capable of 
fulfilling five roles, we now build only one plane or one missile to fulfill 
five roles. That means fewer pieces of the action for fewer contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the financial returns on defense business are falling. Delayed payment 
schedules and the growth of fixed-price development contracts -- in which firms 
must perform work on a fixed price and absorb a share of losses if costs rise 
-- have shifted more of the financial risk to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
These and other problems have been reflected in the declining stock prices of 
defense contractors. Shareholders have seen the firms' market value fall 
dramatically in the past two months. A composite index of defense companies, 
for example, is currently trading at a discount of over 30% on Standard &amp; 
Poor's 400-stock index of industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there has been some realization among defense firms of the need to 
consolidate. One manifestation of that is through "teaming" relationships on 
such programs as the Advanced Tactical Fighter. In that program, a team 
comprising Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed is competing against the team 
of Northrop and McDonnell Douglas. The thinking is to spread the financial risk 
in a difficult environment and keep more contractors involved, albeit with a 
smaller piece. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with that approach, however, is that you don't really reduce 
overall capacity. In some cases, each team member focuses on a specific 
expertise, but in many others, their capability of performing multiple roles is 
still maintained. Instead of feeding everybody a full meal, they try to get by 
giving them half a meal. That may be a short-term transitional fix, but it will 
result in malnutrition in the long run unless defense firms -- large or small 
-- merge or otherwise reduce capacity. 
</P>
<P>
European defense firms out of necessity realized the need to merge or divest 
long before ours and are well on the road to consolidation. Rather than 
plodding along in a declining domestic business, European companies -- well in 
advance of the 1992 framework for cooperation -- have seen the need to 
consolidate efforts with former competitors. They have moved past the stage of 
successful teaming relationships and have announced, at an increasing pace, 
large acquisitions such as West Germany's Daimler-Benz buying 
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, or the British-German GEC-Siemens acquiring 
Britain's Plessey. They have also pursued mergers or joint ventures, such as 
France's Aerospatiale with Alcatel in satellites and British Aerospace with 
France's Thomson-CSF in missiles. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. firms generally have been reluctant to follow this path. Why? 
</P>
<P>
Partly it's because during the Reagan Administration military buildup, they 
were not encouraged to do so. A large base of contractors put pressure on each 
other to assume greater risks and bid aggressively, motivated by the need to 
keep capacity on line and the fear of missing milestone programs and thus being 
left out of a generation of technological advancement. This process increased 
the role of contractors as bankers, helping to finance the buildup. So long as 
the defense budget dollar pool was rising, this system managed to keep a large 
base of contractors afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Now with the prospects of fewer defense dollars to spend, the government is 
effectively forced to say to those in-debt contractors, "Sorry, I've lost my 
high-paying job and can no longer afford the mortgage payments on that 
expensive home you're building for me." 
</P>
<P>
Firms have also relied on growth in the commercial sector of the aerospace 
industry to balance their risk. But as the experiences of Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas and Lockheed in the mid-1970s or early 1980s painfully showed, their 
commercial aerospace businesses were not immune to cyclical vagaries. Even now, 
airline stocks have started to tumble after an active year of consolidations, 
hinting at the possibility of cancellations of future orders. And Europe's 
Airbus Industrie has become a formidable competitor in this previously 
U.S.-dominated market. 
</P>
<P>
Firms may also hesitate in following the merger path out of a perception that 
the Pentagon, concerned about reduced competition, won't allow large-scale 
consolidations. Many companies in fact have believed that Defense Department 
concerns would shield them from hostile U.S. takeover bids while the 
Exon-Florio Amendment, requiring presidential review of foreign takeovers of 
U.S. technology-based companies, would act as a similar hindrance for overseas 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
History has shown, however, that the Defense Department has taken a relatively 
passive role in merger cases. And as uses of Exon-Florio indicate, a surprising 
number of foreign acquisitions have been permitted with only some minor 
tinkering on financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1990s, the U.S. aerospace industry will look significantly 
different. A period of consolidation will have dramatically reduced capacity. 
With the proactive consideration of industry participants, this process can be 
managed to create companies that are strong international competitors. If not, 
the process may unfortunately be characterized by a higher level of 
bankruptcies, writeoffs, layoffs and financial arbitrage opportunities.

ALICE KAHN: ART COLLECTOR GETS OFF TO A HOKEY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Know what you'll be asking yourself in 10 years? Not what were the major 
stories of the '90s. Not who were The People to Watch in '99. Not what's in and 
what's out for the new millennium. Not what's hot and what's not for the '00s. 
</P>
<P>
You'll be asking yourself: Why didn't I buy a Wilson? Why, oh why, didn't I buy 
an H. Wilson? H. Wilson -- you heard it here first. 
</P>
<P>
H. Wilson. It's a name you're going to hear a lot about in the year and decade 
and century and millennium to come. But if you want to get in on the ground 
floor, you're going to have to head for Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana, Mexico. The place where you can buy tequila by the liter for $5.99. 
The place where you can get custom-made leather anythings. The place where you 
can take a photo on a donkey painted like a zebra. Tijuana, the place where you 
can find after-Christmas bargains the whole year round. Take an additional 90% 
off. 
</P>
<P>
I go to Tijuana every year for the ultimate indicator of who's in and who's 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Who is on velvet this year? 
</P>
<P>
It was while checking out the celebrity velvets in an arcade on the Avenida 
Revolucion that I found my Wilson. I passed the velvet Clint Eastwoods, Charles 
Bronsons, one Frank Sinatra and a buxom Liza Minnelli. I took note of the ratio 
of Michael Jacksons to Jesus Christs. 
</P>
<P>
There were, of course, velvet Elvises by the dozens -- weeping and dry. But my 
eye fell on what appeared to be an oil painting of two saguaro cacti at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
"How much for that?" I asked the art dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"How much you wanna pay?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
OK. Let the games begin. "How much you wanna charge?" I said. I know my way 
around the art world. 
</P>
<P>
"That one is $50," he said. I shook my head and started to walk away. He 
yelled, "How much you wanna pay?" 
</P>
<P>
I walked back. "I wanna pay five." 
</P>
<P>
He looked shocked. Then he took down the painting. He held it a few inches from 
my face with his left hand, and with his right he produced an enormous bottle 
of Windex. He blasted the painting with five volleys of Windex. 
</P>
<P>
I coughed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," he said, rubbing the Windex off with his hand. "You see, it is real 
canvas. I can't sell it for five." 
</P>
<P>
The Windex test. You won't see that performed at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
After further haggling, we settled on 10. What a coup! It was only then, when I 
took possession, that I noticed the painting was signed in the corner: H. 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Wilson!" I said to my husband. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted me to put it in my office or the bathroom. But you don't hide a 
Wilson. I put it right across from our bed. Unframed, of course. They say a 
frame cheapens an H. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Now, first thing every morning I say to my husband, "Don't you just love the 
way the dawn lights up the Wilson?" 
</P>
<P>
I have several friends who write about the art world. They find some old 
painter, buy a bunch of his stuff and then write a book about him, increasing 
the value of their own collection. 
</P>
<P>
So I am at work on "Wild as the Windex: The Art and Times of Hokey Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
H. Wilson. You heard it here first.

ZAN THOMPSON: FILLMORE: DEFINITELY NOT FORGOTTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is possible that with the recent rain and the launching of the new year, you 
may have missed one of the most significant celebrations to come our way 
recently. This was the meeting of the Western States Millard G. Fillmore 
Appreciation Society in the town of Fillmore to the north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This society was founded by a gentleman named Bob Coop as a bit of whimsy. But 
it has taken hold of the minds and hearts of Americans everywhere, culminating 
in this series of events in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
One of the outstanding members, who always stands to be counted when they are 
breaking out the banners for our 13th President, is Robert H. Finch, friend of 
Bob Coop, former lieutenant governor of California, former Secretary of Health, 
Education and Welfare and former presidential counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it will be easier for you to understand the magnitude of this event by 
reading an amazing set of documents sent to me by Finch. 
</P>
<P>
First, from the the society's trivia newsletter for November, 1989: 
</P>
<P>
"Exciting news regarding our society: While at a cocktail party in the 
Adriatic, your president bestowed an honorary membership upon Delores I. Day, 
mayor of the city of Fillmore, even though her city is not named for Millard. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of gratitude for this significant honor, Delores has invited us all to a 
gala celebration on our hero's birthday, Sunday, Jan. 7, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that many of you will come. Sunday will be filled with exciting 
events, which will include a luncheon featuring cuisine of the region and a 
long nap in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been getting some flak lately from a few malcontents who have had the 
temerity to question the society's expenditures and have wondered why they 
didn't get more for their measly two bucks. All of you have received an 
exquisite embossed certificate suitable for framing or sticking on your 
refrigerator door, a trivia newsletter, and my undying gratitude. What do you 
want for two bucks a year? 
</P>
<P>
"Will we see you in Fillmore on Jan. 7? We hope so. Bob Coop." 
</P>
<P>
This was an answer to the invitation from Mayor Day and her city staff, who 
seem to have only the iffiest grasp on the general thinking that city business 
should be grim, dull and curmudgeonly. 
</P>
<P>
Here's their invitation: 
</P>
<P>
"My dear Mr. Coop: It is with deep appreciation and gratitude that I accept 
your bribe to host the first annual Western States Millard G. Fillmore 
Appreciation Society reunion in our bristling-with-anticipation city. This will 
be the most exciting event since the retirement luncheon we threw for Bert when 
he retired from his UPS route after 33 years. Even as I write this, our local 
McDonald's restaurant is furiously endeavoring to perfect their McMillard 
souffle -- a big cheese with nothing inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pow-wowed with our City Manager Roy (I love a parade) Payne and 
Councilmen John (over-40 softball team member) Murphy, Roger (may I say a few 
words) Campbell, Scott Lee and Mike (how much will it cost) McMahan, and our 
consensus is that the gala should be held in our city on Jan. 7, 1990, 
Millard's 190th birthday. Available activities will include: musical chaise 
lounges, re-count of the 1856 election (we think he won two states), limbo 
dancing, snail races. 
</P>
<P>
"Our entire staff is extremely apathetic about the festivities. City Clerk 
Noreen (you'll need a permit for that) Withers will be coordinating the 
activities when she feels like it. Kindest personal regards, Delores I. Day." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hutchison Finch attended the gala as a member in good standing of the 
society and had a wonderful time. He says that the entire city staff attended 
the full weekend's events, including the eucalyptus tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
I will look forward to the annual Millard G. Fillmore Appreciation Day in 
January, 1991. Perhaps we can all go to Fillmore together.

ERMA BOMBECK: TEENY TINY THEATER OF THE ABSURD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other night my husband and I went to one of those movie mazes in the mall 
where there are six theaters in an area the size of a three-car garage. Is it 
my imagination, or are these theaters becoming smaller? I fought an 
overwhelming urge to introduce myself to the other seven people who were there. 
</P>
<P>
One of the great thrills of going to movies used to be that viewers were 
treated to pictures of people bigger than life. On this screen, Rambo would 
have looked like a troll, and Gandhi would have appeared lonely. 
</P>
<P>
I drifted for a moment and actually imagined I was in my own living room. It 
wasn't much of a stretch. A couple of kids played noisily in the aisle, and a 
girl two rows back was having a conversation on how the cleaners had shrunk her 
sweater. Someone groped to a seat balancing a taco and a 62-ounce cylinder of 
cola and ice. Another man shouted up the aisle, "Loretta, while you're up, get 
me some Milk Duds." 
</P>
<P>
The man next to me was seated so close that his musk cologne put me in a coma. 
Any more intimacy and we would have made plans to pick out a dish pattern. For 
this I shaved my legs and put on eye makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that no one stuck to the script. The original scenario was that 
television would destroy the movie industry. Television would be so great and 
so convenient that families would stay home and bond together around the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Someone misread kids. They don't care if "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" looks like 
a piece of lint on the screen; they will still drive 12 miles and wait in line 
to see it. I personally know children who entered one of those movie complexes 
when they were preschoolers and didn't come out until puberty. 
</P>
<P>
There's a trend here somewhere, but I can't figure out what it is or why. As 
television screens get bigger, movie screens get smaller. If the trend 
continues, we may be showing "The Brady Bunch" baking cookies at your local 
theater and "Lawrence of Arabia" on home TV screens that span the living room, 
dining room and kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe family life will center on these small cinema-closets where the same 
people will meet week after week and get to know one another. Intimacy will 
spark relationships. ("Remember me? I sat next to you at 'Caddy Shack' and we 
laughed at the same jokes.") Babies will be born. ("I was two rows behind you 
when you went into labor during 'Fatal Attraction.' ") 
</P>
<P>
We're almost to that point. When you call the theater and ask what time the 
feature begins, don't be surprised if the manager answers, "It starts in five 
minutes. If you're late, don't expect me to fill you in on the beginning."

TREASURE TROVE OF MAPS; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL UCLA LIBRARY SERVES ACADEMICS AND ADVENTURERS ALIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes UCLA's Henry Bruman Map Library -- academia's largest -- is a 
footnote in an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in 1983 when two men, carrying what they said was a treasure 
map drawn by 17th-Century pirate William Kidd, approached the library's staff. 
The men explained that they hoped to find an island in the real world identical 
to the island on their map. Library staffer Jonnie Hargis helped them sift 
through some of the 750,000 maps in the collection. Finally, Hargis recalled, 
"we found an area off the coast of Vietnam that matched the chart." 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the pirate's treasure was buried somewhere on Phu Quoc, a 
Vietnamese-held island in the Gulf of Thailand, the men went to Thailand, where 
they rented a speedboat and secretly sailed to Phu Quoc. But before the 
treasure hunters could start shoveling in earnest, they were arrested by 
Vietnamese officials. Held for months in solitary confinement, they were 
finally released after their families bribed authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We get some real oddballs and a lot of idle browsers," said Hargis, who says 
there is a romance or magic about maps that fascinates many people. Among the 
other treasure hunters Hargis has assisted: a man looking for submerged Nazi 
gold in German lakes and others seeking lost California gold mines. 
</P>
<P>
As map librarian Carlos Hagen-Lautrup explained, the major purpose of the 
library is to serve the university's academic enterprise. But it is open to the 
public as well. As a result, users include everyone from an astrologer who 
regularly calls asking for the precise coordinates of clients' birthplaces for 
use in preparing their astrological charts to people who are planning trips and 
want to study street maps of Cracow or Buenos Aires before they go. And, Hargis 
said, "every time there's a quake, you can count on a surge of fault maps being 
pulled." 
</P>
<P>
The makers of the movie "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes" 
found old maps of Africa in the collection that bore the colonial names in use 
during the period of their film. Environmental consultants come to the library 
to study maps of Los Angeles for evidence of factories or other past use that 
might preclude present-day development of a particular parcel of land. And 
library staffer Portia Chambliss once helped a visitor determine the 
neighborhood where Charles Dickens' lame but game Tiny Tim would have probably 
lived by consulting a descriptive map of London poverty from 1889. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the staff prides itself on being able to find the right map -- or 
nautical chart -- for almost any visitor. The only time Chambliss recalls being 
stumped was when she was asked for a map of Iraq in the 15th Century that 
showed climatic conditions and rainfall. "That was impossible." 
</P>
<P>
The map library was founded in 1961 by the former chairman of the geography 
department for whom it is named. It has been headed since 1962 by 
Hagen-Lautrup, a Chilean-born geographer and engineer who has tried to make it 
a cartographic information center, not just a map room. "It's the information 
that counts, not the medium," said Hagen-Lautrup. As a result, most of the 
truly old maps in the collection, with the exception of a 1600 map of Flanders, 
are reproductions, not originals. Visitors can handle the reproductions more 
readily than originals, and the library does not need to take elaborate 
security precautions to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
The library is a depository for maps issued by agencies of the U.S. government 
and several other countries, Hagen-Lautrup said. But in the last decade or so, 
collecting has been complicated by the skyrocketing price of maps. "Many 
governments want to use maps as a source of income, especially Third World 
countries," said Hagen-Lautrup, who has seen prices rise from a dollar or two 
per map to $15 or $20. 
</P>
<P>
Some maps are hard to get at any price, he said. Ostensibly because of concerns 
about national security, "Colombia and Bolivia don't sell detailed maps to 
anybody," he said. Detailed maps of the People's Republic of China are also 
hard to come by, but the library has an excellent collection of Chinese city 
plans put together in China by a former UCLA student visiting that country. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in a warren of rooms in the basement of Bunche Hall (the UCLA building 
that looks like a giant waffle), the collection has yet to be catalogued in 
full, although all the maps have been categorized using a standardized system 
for maps comparable to those used for books. Special strengths of the 
collection, the librarian said, include materials related to the Mideast, 
Africa, Latin America, the Pacific islands, city plans and early California. 
Materials don't circulate, but patrons can make copies to take home. 
</P>
<P>
Already larger than any collection in the United States except those of the 
Library of Congress, the National Archives and the Defense Mapping Agency, the 
UCLA collection continues to grow. Every day, the staff clips all the maps that 
appear in the Los Angeles Times and other major newspapers, copies them on 
acid-free paper and adds them to the collection. Hagen-Lautrup said maps of Los 
Angeles's "restaurant row" and proposed development of the marina, for 
instance, could be invaluable some day to urban planners or social historians. 
</P>
<P>
Since the staff believes that a map is much more than a graphic guide for 
getting from Point A to Point B, the collection also includes maps of imaginary 
places such as C. S. Lewis' Narnia and mental or cognitive maps. Mental maps, 
the librarian said, are graphic representations of how people (usually people 
who are not professional cartographers) perceive their environment. 
</P>
<P>
The library's collection, for example, includes a book on how Turkish workers 
in Germany perceive the city of Cologne. "Some cartographers don't want 
anything to do with that," said Hagen-Lautrup. "They think it's trash." But 
Hagen-Lautrup said he and his staff are fascinated by the psychological, 
cultural and social implications of such highly personal maps. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this interest, the collection includes many variations on the Saul 
Steinberg cover for the New Yorker that shows the mental map of a Manhattanite, 
with New York City in the foreground and nothing much of importance between the 
Empire State Building and the distant Pacific Ocean. Among the local versions: 
the United States as seen by a Santa Monican, with Santa Monica Pier as the 
center of the universe.

WESTSIDE PROVING TOUGH FOR GOP TO CRACK; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE NEW DECADE WILL BRING REAPPORTIONMENT. BUT EXPERTS SAY IT'S 
UNLIKELY THAT EVEN A REDRAWING OF POLITICAL BOUNDARIES WILL TOPPLE THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to 1990, the year of the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar shows an election this year for state and federal offices, but on 
the Westside this has not set pulses racing. 
</P>
<P>
The area's representatives in Congress and the Legislature, Democrats all, are 
assured of reelection in their carefully crafted, politically safe districts. 
About all each one needs to do is keep breathing and avoid a major scandal. 
</P>
<P>
It's a one-party system. 
</P>
<P>
But the coming of a new decade will also bring reapportionment, the 
constitutionally mandated, slightly unseemly process of redrawing political 
boundaries to adjust for population changes. 
</P>
<P>
Reapportionment can strike terror in a politician's heart. Job security is at 
stake. Power can be won or lost by a simple shift in a district boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Might the redistricting of the 1990s resurrect the two-party system in at least 
parts of the Westside? Not very likely, say the experts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Westside is to the Democratic Party what Orange County is to the 
Republican Party," says Allan Hoffenblum, a veteran GOP political consultant. 
The area, he says, "will always be heavily Democratic, barring some 
extraordinary circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Westside is heavily white, Democratic and liberal, with the largest 
concentration of Jewish voters outside of New York. In many neighborhoods, 
Democrats outnumber Republicans by 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain, who has written extensively about 
redistricting, says the Westside is all but impossible for Republicans to 
crack, no matter how the lines are drawn. There just aren't enough Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you are going to take the area south of the Ventura Freeway, 
the really Jewish areas of the Westside -- take Santa Monica, Venice, areas 
around Beverly Hills -- no way you're going to transform these into competitive 
areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Berman, a top Democratic political strategist, reapportionment expert 
and brother of Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), says simply: "West Los 
Angeles is solidly Democratic turf." 
</P>
<P>
The Westside serves as the political base for the powerful Democratic campaign 
organization headed by Reps. Berman and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
Altogether, five Democratic congressman share a piece of this choice political 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
But adjoining areas have a different political makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is sharply divided politically, socially and economically. There is 
Democratic territory, Republican territory and occasional patches of 
competitive ground where the loyalty of voters is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans dominate the upper-income communities that hug the coast from 
Pacific Palisades to Malibu and Manhattan Beach to Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The northwestern and northeastern reaches of the San Fernando Valley also are 
increasingly GOP territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mix together Westside Democratic strongholds and suburban Republican precincts 
in the same district and the chance for political competition increases, 
particularly if there is an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
One potentially competitive district is that of Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica). His 27th Congressional District stretches from the edge of Topanga 
Canyon through Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, Mar Vista, Venice, Marina del 
Rey and Playa del Rey before jutting inland to reach black Democratic voters in 
Inglewood. The district line then heads south into the more Republican and 
conservative South Bay beach cities and Torrance. A finger reaches all the way 
down to Terminal Island. The district is 54% Democratic in registration. 
</P>
<P>
Another district that might someday be a battleground lies to the north and 
east of Levine's territory. The 23rd Congressional District of Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) includes Westwood, Beverly Hills, Century City, 
Brentwood, Bel-Air and Malibu, as well as the San Fernando Valley communities 
of Reseda, Tarzana, Woodland Hills, Canoga Park and Encino. Democrats make up 
53% of the registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth in outlying areas of the state during the 1980s may 
force the boundary lines of the Levine and Beilenson districts to stretch 
farther from the solidly Democratic precincts of the Westside into more risky 
Republican territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible a redistricting could make one or possibly two of these people 
uncomfortable," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
If Levine, who is regarded as a potential challenger to U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston 
in 1992, vacates his seat, the district would be competitive, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's district, likewise, "under the right circumstances, could be won by 
a Republican," adds Hoffenblum. 
</P>
<P>
But as long as Beilenson and Levine stay put, change is unlikely because of the 
built-in advantages they have over challengers in fund raising, staffing and 
the ability to attract media attention and to communicate with voters. 
"Incumbency is the most powerful force in America right now," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing stirs an incumbent politician's instinct for self-preservation more 
than reapportionment. Once every 10 years, after the new census is completed, 
the boundary lines for every Assembly, Senate and congressional district must 
be redrawn by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The process offers a unique twist to the political adage: "To the victor goes 
the spoils" because lawmakers effectively determine their own political 
destinies by the lines that are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1812, when Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry approved a blatantly partisan 
redistricting plan complete with a salamander-shaped district, critics dubbed 
it a gerrymander. The label stuck. 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been gerrymandering and always will be gerrymandering as long 
as the people who run are drawing the lines," Hoffenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to change that equation, half a dozen initiatives are being 
circulated to overhaul the way legislative and congressional districts are 
drawn in California. 
</P>
<P>
Two of those initiatives may qualify for the June ballot. One, sponsored by San 
Mateo County Supervisor Tom Huening, a Republican, and backed by the League of 
Women Voters, would create a 12-member reapportionment commission composed of 
five Democrats, five Republicans and two independents. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal, by Marin County businessman Gary Flynn, would require a 
two-thirds vote by the Legislature and majority approval by the voters before 
reapportionment plans could be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are a wild card in the redistricting process. So is the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of Republicans, in the early 1980s Democrats controlled the 
reapportionment process in California. With majorities in both houses of the 
Legislature and with Edmund G. Brown Jr. in the governor's office, Democrats 
drew lines that enhanced their own political power, particularly in Congress. 
Although Democrats statewide account for barely half of the registered voters, 
they hold 60% of the state's congressional seats -- 27 out of 45. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the stakes are high once again. 
</P>
<P>
California's population grew by at least 5.4 million people in the 1980s -- a 
number greater than the overall population of most states. Much of the huge 
22.8% population growth occurred in outlying areas of Los Angeles, Riverside, 
San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties, and in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in population is expected to bring six or seven additional 
congressional seats for California, boosting the state's delegation to 51 or 52 
members. It will be the largest House contingent of any state in the nation's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in congressional seats will mean an identical growth in electoral 
votes, potentially giving California one-fifth of the total electoral votes 
needed to capture the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Quinn, a Republican reapportionment expert now working for a public 
relations firm in Sacramento, said there could be a deadlock on new district 
boundaries if the Republicans hold on to the governor's office. In that case, 
the state Supreme Court could be called upon to draw the lines as they did in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn said it is possible there is going to be "a bipartisan deal that 
protects virtually all incumbents in the Legislature and the congressional 
delegation" no matter who is governor. He said the inclination in the state 
Capitol is "to try to settle it without a whole lot of blood." 
</P>
<P>
Given the nature of recent population growth, Quinn expects little change in 
Assembly and Senate districts in Los Angeles County. "That delegation hasn't 
changed much in many years," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Cain offered a similar sentiment. The reality of incumbents drawing the lines 
should discourage creation of competitive seats, he said. "I don't look for any 
radical shake-up of representation." 
</P>

DEVELOPER SELLING DISPUTED LAND IN LAS PULGAS CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposed by neighbors and beset by problems with the state Coastal Commission, a 
real estate developer has abandoned his two-year effort to develop Las Pulgas 
Canyon in Pacific Palisades and has placed the property up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Among the last undeveloped coastal canyons in Los Angeles, the 26-acre property 
is being advertised for $10.5 million, about $9 million more than developer 
Neil Senturia paid for it less than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ready to declare victory, but we're thrilled that he appears to have 
thrown in the towel," said Ron Wolf, president of Save Las Pulgas Canyon Inc., 
which opposed Senturia's plan to build up to 50 houses in the landslide-plagued 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Group members are pushing a plan to have area residents join forces with the 
state and city governments to buy the canyon for use as a park or nature 
preserve. They say the plan has been warmly received by City Councilman Marvin 
Braude and state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Senturia, who heads Senturia Investments Inc. of San Diego, did not return 
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
However, Paul Pekar, a broker with the Jon Douglas Co., which listed the 
property, said it has been for sale since December. "We've had several 
expressions of interest; that's about all I would care to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged canyon borders Sunset Boulevard just north of Temescal Canyon Road 
and funnels out to Pacific Coast Highway, offering a stunning ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Although the natural beauty of the property has long attracted hikers, 
picnickers and even a few filmmakers, its natural hazards have put off would-be 
developers, who had to contend with crumbling hillsides, unstable fill and a 
flood plain that caused a concrete dam to burst 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have long argued that the canyon is unfit for any large 
development, citing a landslide that destroyed two homes at the top of the 
canyon in 1962, and another slide in 1983 that caused the closure of Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's problems began after he cut a road into the canyon and did other 
grading there in 1988 without the permission of the Coastal Commission. 
Residents above the canyon were outraged, fearing that further work in the 
canyon might jeopardize their hillside residences. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Commission Chairman Michael Wornum called it one of the worst 
violations he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the commission agreed to issue an after-the-fact permit to 
construct the road and conduct geological tests in the canyon on the condition 
that Senturia repair the damage. However, coastal officials say Senturia never 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still actively pursuing compliance in the case, and in the event the 
property is sold, we will continue to pursue the matter," said Nancy Cave, the 
commission's chief enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia bought the canyon in 1987 at the fire-sale price of $1.6 million from 
the owner of an excavation company who dumped fill in the property over many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's opponents say this is not the first time that he has attempted to 
sell the property. "We have brochures he had printed, offering the property for 
$30 million through a real estate firm in Hawaii last year," said Jacques 
Beugelmans, an area resident. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have called the $10.5-million price tag "unrealistically high," and 
insist that, after Senturia's experience, other would-be developers may shy 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"No one with any brains will try to do what he did," resident Lloyd Ahern said. 
"We beat the guy (Senturia) when we weren't even organized. Knowing what we 
know now, can you imagine the problems the next developer would have?" 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy last year awarded a $35,000 grant to a 
San Francisco-area research firm that is soon to conduct a study aimed at 
determining how the canyon may best be put to public use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic about the canyon, but we want to be careful at the same 
time," Beugelmans said. "There's always the possibility that a foreign investor 
could come in and snap it up."

VOTERS LEAGUE SUGGESTS $65,000 CAMPAIGN LIMIT; 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY HILLS: SOME CANDIDATES FOR THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE SPENT CLOSER TO 
$100,000 IN THEIR QUEST FOR A SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Running for office in a small city shouldn't be too much of a financial burden. 
No one has ever spent more than $500 on a campaign in Alturas, a town of 3,025 
souls in northeast California, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills is different, however, and the League of Women Voters wants 
candidates for the April election to hold their spending to $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like a lot, but candidates have spent a lot more in Beverly 
Hills, where the biggest turnout for an election in recent years was just more 
than 9,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bernie Hecht spent $105,698 on his campaign two years ago, at a 
cost of about $32.30 for every vote he received, and Mary Levin Cutler's 
unsuccessful bid in the same election cost $93,645, or $56.38 per vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking about the idea of saving money on advertising and mailings 
and just give a $20 bill to each voter," joked Mayor Max Salter, who spent 
$97,227, or $28.08 a vote, when he ran for office in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both absurd and obscene in a community of this size to spend that kind of 
dough," Salter said. "It precludes somebody without the ability to raise money 
to run for office." 
</P>
<P>
Salter said he will be running again in the election scheduled for April 10, 
which will be canceled if no one runs against him and Robert K. Tanenbaum, the 
other incumbent whose term expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tricia Roth, a pediatrician whose campaigns against alcohol in recent years 
have led some residents to nickname her the Carry Nation of Beverly Hills, took 
out papers to run for the City Council. But she said she has not yet decided 
whether to run. The filing deadline is Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having exploratory meetings with some people who are knowledgeable in 
politics," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that the league has tried to limit the spending of 
aspiring City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of community comment saying that it's a rather extravagant 
thing we do here, and that they're in favor of spending less," said Dorothy 
Kaufman, president of the league's Beverly Hills chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the Beverly Hills Unified School District Board of Education 
went along with a $40,000 limit in 1987, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
And, two years ago, all but one of the 12 candidates for three open seats on 
the five-member City Council agreed to spend no more than $60,000 on their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement collapsed after one candidate said she had planned her 
campaign well in advance, "and she had a lot of commitments and whatever that 
was necessary for the campaign," Kaufman said. "So that went by the boards, and 
it cost well beyond $60,000, even for people who agreed to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
This time, she said, the league decided that $65,000 would be a good figure, 
given the increased costs of mailing, printing, advertising and other 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
To the man or woman who has nothing, $65,000 and $100,000 are equally daunting 
amounts of money. But the job can be done for less. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Allan L. Alexander spent $56,820, and brought in the most votes when 
he was elected to the City Council in 1988. Tanenbaum, who took his turn as 
mayor in 1988-'89, spent $55,623, and also got the most votes when he was first 
elected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said that he likes the concept of a spending ceiling but cautions 
that setting it too low could scare challengers out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's too restrictive, it can change the election process in ways that are 
not necessarily desirable, by giving a strong advantage to incumbents that are 
well-known in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum agreed. "Incumbents inherently have advantages and name recognition, 
an opportunity to be on television and have people evaluate our performance (on 
cable TV broadcasts of City Council meetings)." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed limit is still a lot of money, but it doesn't buy all that much: 
two citywide mailings, perhaps, along with flyers, lawn signs, advertisements 
in the two local papers and the services of a local campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
The more expensive campaigns get rented offices and extra advertisements for 
their $100,000, as well as the advice of political professionals from 
Sacramento and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the benefits (of a $65,000 limit) is that it will reduce the 
professional participation in the campaigns, which I personally feel is for the 
better," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some drawbacks to the proposal, politicians and political 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds, who was elected in 1988 at a cost of $89,794, 
said that a last-minute mailing by a property-owners group forced her to send 
out an extra mailing late in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Such spending by outside groups would not be affected by the league's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Under those circumstances, limitations become unfair," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said she had already hired a campaign manager and made plans for a 
more expensive campaign before the league proposed its $60,000 limit in 1988. 
In the course of negotiations among the candidates, it was clear that other 
campaigns were also ready to spend more, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Herman, legislative advocate in Sacramento for the League of Women 
Voters of California, said the league's position is that public matching funds 
should be made available to candidates who agree to abide by spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Such a matching fund system is already used in U.S. presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
Without the incentive of matching funds, candidates would have no reason to 
restrain spending, according to Matt Stodder, a senior researcher for the 
California Commission on Campaign Financing, an independent group that studies 
local campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
"If candidates feel they've really got to spend money, they'll do it," he said. 
"But if there's an incentive to keep them within limits, maybe they'll do 
that."

HILL COMES FLYING WHEN BILL'S SPONSOR NEEDS HIM

How much is one vote worth at the state Capitol? 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) on Wednesday, the answer was 
more than $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much one Democratic assemblymen paid to rent a private plane to fly 
Hill to the state Capitol to vote on a controversial no-fault auto insurance 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, Hill was flown 
Wednesday morning from the El Monte airport in a twin turboprop plane to a 
landing strip 30 miles east of Sacramento -- a location selected to avoid 
low-lying winter fog. Hill was met by a legislative sergeant-at-arms, who drove 
him to an Assembly committee meeting to vote for Johnston's no-fault bill. 
</P>
<P>
Hill voted, quickly left the room, was driven back to the airstrip and hopped 
the plane back to Southern California, where he is running to fill a vacancy in 
the 31st senatorial district, which covers part of the San Gabriel Valley. Hill 
delivered a noontime speech, got on a commercial airplane and flew back to 
Sacramento later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Hill's extraordinary trip, Johnston's no-fault insurance bill was 
defeated by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said he decided to fly Hill to Sacramento because a preliminary head 
count showed that the vote would be close. Johnston said he wanted to make sure 
that all his supporters, including Hill, were present. 
</P>
<P>
The cost: $3,645, paid out of Johnston's campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It was painful to expend the money, I assure you. But it was in the pursuit of 
a governmental purpose," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill conceded that his morning flight was unusual but said it was for a good 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big bill," he said.

'OVERWHELMING YES' TO CURB ON MONTEREY PARK GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does Proposition K have merit as a growth control measure? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that question was never addressed during Councilman Chris 
Houseman's insufferably long diatribe against myself and the Residents Assn. of 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever suggested, let alone stated, that 48 signatures accompanying our 
initiative qualified it for the ballot. Those signatures were gathered in order 
to ascertain if there was still interest in growth control in Monterey Park. 
The answer is an overwhelming yes! 
</P>
<P>
As was pointed out in your article (Times, Jan. 11), the City Council can place 
an initiative on the ballot if it so chooses. That is the law. Houseman's 
shrieks of political chicanery are merely a harbinger of another election. 
</P>
<P>
The original Proposition K stood up in court not on its merit, but on a 
technicality. During the 47-day trial, the judge raised a great many questions, 
prompting a Proposition K that has been rewritten to make it more defensible in 
court. For the first time, the number of condominiums that can be built each 
year is tied directly to the city's General Plan. It also allows for affordable 
and senior citizen housing, as well as limiting the number of condominium units 
that can be carried over from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
There are other features, too, but without a doubt the absence of Proposition K 
in Monterey Park would subject our city to an onslaught of up to 1,300 condos 
as fast as they could be built. 
</P>
<P>
Our community is now protected from runaway development by a blanket of 
building standards and ordinances. Proposition K is woven into and is an 
important part of that blanket. We will now have the opportunity to reaffirm 
the need for Proposition K at the ballot box. Is that a terrible thing?

MEDICAL SCHOOL GETS $2.4-MILLION GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA School of Medicine has received $2.4 million from the Revlon 
Foundation to support a research program directed at breast and ovarian 
cancers. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the gift and the creation of the Revlon-UCLA Women's Cancer Research 
Program earlier this month, Ronald O. Perelman, chairman and chief executive 
officer of the cosmetics firm, said: "The Revlon grant will help expedite the 
vital and exciting research under way at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Breast and ovarian cancers take a tragic toll in human mortality and suffering. 
I hope this grant will speed the day when these devastating cancers can be 
controlled and eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Breast and ovarian cancers account for one-third of all cancers in women, a 
UCLA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which will be given to UCLA over three years, will provide 
fellowships for postdoctoral fellows and seed grants for innovative research 
related to women's cancer. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA faculty member Dennis Slamon will head the program's research team.

NEW RADAR DEVICE USES WARNING SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new radar device has been turning motorists' heads in Santa Monica for the 
past few days. The portable Speed Controller, a digital display mounted on the 
roof of a parked police car, flashes "Your speed is. . . ." and the speed of 
each passing car. 
</P>
<P>
It's being used by the Santa Monica Police Department as a "strictly 
psychological deterrent" to speeding, said Lt. Robert Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The device will be used primarily near schools and in areas with high accident 
rates, such as Pacific Coast Highway and San Vicente Boulevard, Taylor said. 
Part of the strategy, he said, is to use the Speed Controller on a marked 
patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he was "impressed with the reaction of the public" Tuesday morning, 
when the device was set up for the first time near Franklin Elementary School 
on Montana Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd estimate 75% of the drivers observed the unit and made abrupt adjustments 
to their speed. . . . You see brake lights coming on," he said.

HOME SALES: A GLUT OF UNSOLD HOMES HAS CREATED SOME OF THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR BARGAINS IN YEARS. BUYERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRICE DISCOUNTS, FREE 
UPGRADES, LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND OTHER BONUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While soaring prices and a softening economy began putting the brakes on sales 
of existing homes last spring, the slowdown has now spread to California's 
$24-billion new-home market too. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of the downturn are as numerous as the now-idled bulldozers that just a 
year ago were turning huge parcels of raw land into bedroom communities 
seemingly overnight. 
</P>
<P>
* In Moorpark, builder Urban West Communities slashes $40,000 off the price of 
the final 54 homes in its Creekside development to spark sluggish sales. Homes 
originally priced at about $284,000 now go for $244,000; the builder asks 
$295,000 for houses once listed at nearly $335,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to negotiate with buyers now, which is something we really 
didn't do over the past three or four years," said Kathy Dantagnan, the 
company's vice president of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
* Griffin Homes offers two free tickets for a weeklong Mediterranean cruise to 
anyone who'll buy a home in its nine new Southland tracts. They range from 
$130,000 "starter" homes in Moreno Valley to $800,000 estate properties in 
Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
* In Ventura County, Weston Development offers $5,000 in free upgrades and 
mortgage subsidies worth thousands more to buyers at its 134-unit single-family 
tract in Port Hueneme and a 66-unit townhouse development in the city of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to spur sales, and this is a good way to do it," said Bob Jones, the 
company's vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
* The state's biggest single-family home builder, Kaufman &amp; Broad Home 
Corp., offers to pay up to $5,000 of its buyers' closing costs at half of the 
25 tracts it has open in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us knew that a slowdown was coming, but nobody expected sales to 
deteriorate so fast," said Joseph A. Gallagher, whose company, Leisure 
Technology, recently slashed $50,000 off some of the $500,000-plus custom homes 
it is building in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Across Southern California, home builders large and small seem willing to deal. 
The Times interviewed 24 builders -- including heavyweights such as Kaufman 
&amp; Broad, J. M. Peters Co. and Marlborough Development -- and found only one 
company that wasn't offering price discounts, free upgrades, low-interest loans 
or some other bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics speak for themselves. According to the most recent figures 
compiled by the Meyers Group, a Los Angeles-based real estate information and 
consulting firm, sales of new single- 
</P>
<P>
family homes in the fast-growing Antelope Valley are down 44% from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
New-home sales are off 43% in the San Gabriel Valley and a staggering 62% in 
the San Fernando Valley/Santa Clarita area. 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the Southland, sales are down 52% in San Diego, 38% in San 
Bernardino and 42% in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Construction, though, hasn't declined nearly as fast -- and the glut of new 
homes on the market is the primary reason why builders are offering such big 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Meyers Group reports that there are now 1,177 new houses for sale in the 
Antelope Valley, more than twice the number of a year ago. The 1,031 homes for 
sale in the San Fernando/Santa Clarita area is nearly three times higher. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 new houses are on the market in the San Gabriel Valley, compared 
to a paltry seven homes available a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,710 new homes are for sale in San Diego County, up 16% from a year 
earlier. The 1,348 homes for sale in San Bernardino are up 38%. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the 1,575 new houses on the market is nearly three times the 
number for sale a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering worst is the "move-up" new-home market -- homes geared toward people 
who already have a house, but want one that's nicer and more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The most softness in L.A., Orange County and San Diego is in the $300,000- to 
$600,000-range, and in the Inland Empire it is homes that sell for $200,000 and 
up," said Jeffrey S. Meyers, president of the Meyers Group. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do with the softer resale market. You can't buy a new home 
if you can't sell your old one, and right now, a lot of people can't sell." 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is wreaking havoc with many builders' profits. Although most 
privately held companies won't release earnings or sales reports, some builders 
confide that their net income is down between 20% and 40% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly held companies can't hide the bad news. J. M. Peters Co., which caters 
to the move-up market, announced last month that its earnings dropped 39% in 
its most recent nine-month period, and sales were down nearly 50% from a year 
earlier. Jittery investors on Wall Street soon sent the stock to a 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
While the slowdown is bad news for builders, it's great news for would-be home 
buyers. Price discounts and other incentives, combined with some of the lowest 
mortgage rates in a decade, are allowing consumers to strike bargains unheard 
of just one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
LeAnn and Curtis Mathews, for example, have spent nearly two years shopping for 
a new home. They even entered lotteries at some hot-selling projects, where 
builders pulled names out of drums to determine who'd be able to buy their 
limited number of houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Then all of a sudden, the market cooled down and we were in the driver's 
seat," LeAnn Mathews said. "We just bought a brand-new, four-bedroom home here 
in Moorpark and the builder knocked $40,000 off the sales price." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Wilhoite and his wife, Rita, recently bought a new $321,000 home in Port 
Hueneme from a builder who agreed to an $8,000 mortgage-payment subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe we got such a great house and a great deal," Wilhoite said. 
"We didn't ask for the $8,000, but we sure weren't going to turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the price cuts and other incentives, some people still aren't 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
"We started looking a couple of months ago, but we still think everything is 
overpriced," said Tim Johnson as he and his wife toured a Riverside development 
where the builder is offering mortgage subsidies worth more than $5,000 and 
also is willing to pay another $5,000 in closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're talking about spending $200,000 or $250,000, what difference does 
$5,000 or $10,000 make? Besides, there are deals like this being offered all 
over the place." 
</P>
<P>
The slow sales pace and price-discounting is eating into many builders' 
bottom-lines. That's a sharp turnaround from a year ago, when some builders 
were literally raising prices overnight and still selling out their housing 
tracts in record time. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard profit margin is probably around 14% to 18% of the sales price, 
but now some of the builders are working on less than 10%," said Phil Yasskin, 
president of the Los Angeles/Ventura County division of J. M. Peters Co. "Just 
last year, some builders had margins in the 20% to 30%-range." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, builders are caught between a rock and a hard place. They don't 
like to cut their prices or offer other incentives, but the alternative -- 
letting their homes sit empty -- is a costly proposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it costs a builder about $85 a day for every $300,000-home that he has 
sitting empty," said Ed Parker, vice president of sales and marketing at 
Marlborough Development. "First, you're paying interest on your construction 
loan. And then there are all sorts of other expenses, like maintenance costs to 
keep the homes looking brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take $85 and multiply it by the number of homes you've got sitting 
empty, you're talking about a fairly significant cost that you're incurring 
every day. The longer your homes sit empty, the more you lose." 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers don't feel much sympathy for developers' dwindling profits. "I 
think builders have been gouging us for years," said Laura Bernstein, who's 
been sporadically looking at new homes in Orange County since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a tract a year ago where the first homes sold for $225,000. A few 
months later, the second phase was selling for $265,000 or $275,000," she said. 
"They were just like the ones in the first phase, but the builder had jacked up 
the price $50,000 because he knew he could get it." 
</P>
<P>
Such steep price hikes are a thing of the past. But while some home builders 
are simply cutting prices to lure more buyers, others have adopted more offbeat 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"Our most popular program is what we call our 'Winter Payback Program,' " said 
Debra Bernard, director of marketing for building giant Kaufman &amp; Broad. 
</P>
<P>
"If you buy a home in some of our subdivisions, we'll make the rental payments 
or mortgage payments on your current home until you close escrow on the new 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Several companies have launched costly mortgage-rate buy-down programs, where 
the builder essentially subsidizes the buyers' monthly payments for one, two, 
even five years. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Baldwin Co. is offering buyers in three San Diego County 
developments an initial interest rate of about 7 1/4%, nearly three percentage 
points below market rates. The rate gradually rises over 18 months to about 10 
1/4%, where it stays for the rest of the 30-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Others are being even more generous. To spur sales at its Oceanside project, 
Leisure Technology recently offered prospective buyers cut-rate mortgages and 
$15,000 in credits that could be used for landscaping or upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
For buyers having trouble selling their current homes, Leisure Tech would also 
arrange a 90-day swing loan to help them complete their purchase in Oceanside 
-- and the builder would make all the interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wouldn't be able to close escrow without it," said Gallagher, 
president of the company's Southern California division. 
</P>
<P>
Few experts believe the new-home market is headed for the type of meltdown that 
occurred in the 1980s, when construction plunged after interest rates soared to 
record highs and recession gripped the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any crash," said Ben Bartolotto, an economist and director of 
the nonprofit Construction Industry Research Board. "Interest rates are under 
control and there's no recession around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Demand for housing is still pretty strong. It's not as strong as it was a year 
or two ago, but it's still there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the magnitude of price cuts and other costly incentive programs has left 
some experts wondering if many builders are overreacting to the slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Every builder knows that sales go down in the winter, and everybody knew that 
we couldn't sustain the kind of sales and price increases that we saw over the 
past couple of years," said Sharon Dyer of Watt Homes, a builder who is 
offering little in the way of bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us thought the market would level off in the last quarter of '89, and 
it did. So what happened? Some builders panicked, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how long such generous incentive programs will last is anyone's guess. 
Some say they'll disappear in the spring, which is the prime home buying 
season. Others say the bonuses will last into the summer or early fall, because 
it will take at least six months before the inventory of both used and new 
homes will go back down to their normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
One factor that could tend to rush the demise of more lucrative incentive 
programs is an expected slowdown in new construction. The Construction Industry 
Research Board predicts that 143,000 new single-family homes will be built in 
California this year, an 11% decline from the 160,000 houses built in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a real significant drop, but it will help put inventories back in 
line," said CIRB's Bartolotto. "Sales will pick up again, and you won't see 
builders making the kinds of concessions that they're making today." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, buyers are clearly calling the shots in today's new-home 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"We've left a a 30-year-old house that's a 'money pit' and bought a gorgeous, 
brand-new home in a good family neighborhood," said LeAnn Mathews, the new 
Moorpark homeowner. "And, we got a $40,000-discount to boot. What else could 
you ask for?"

HOT PROPERTY: 'LITTLE JOE' RETURNS TO LIFE ON A RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MICHAEL LANDON, whose big break came 30 years ago as Little Joe Cartwright on 
the weekly TV western "Bonanza," is back on the ranch now in a home he just 
built in a Malibu canyon. 
</P>
<P>
And as for missing the oceanfront Malibu Colony house he sold before the 
holidays, Landon said by phone last week: 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no, miss all those people poking their noses in my windows? No. And this 
place is great for the kids too." 
</P>
<P>
The actor/writer/director/producer has nine children. Two are from his current 
marriage to his third wife, Cindy, but all come to the Landons' new home on the 
weekends, said architect Robert Earl. Earl designed the walled-in compound, 
which he calls "a ranch estate," with the children in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-acre property has a field where the children can play, stables for six 
horses, park-like grounds, a tennis pavilion, swimming pool with fountains, 
aviary, dog run and the latest in security features. It has a two-story, 
17,000-square-foot main house with restaurant-style cooking facilities, 
numerous fireplaces and entertainment areas, eight bedrooms and an office. It 
also has some guest cabanas and a servants' quarters in a separate house. 
</P>
<P>
"All the rooms (in the main residence) open onto the pool," Earl said, 
describing the architectural style as Santa Barbara Mission with a central 
courtyard. "And we used Italian tiles, marble, granite, wood and stained-glass 
skylights throughout." The home also has some limestone floors. 
</P>
<P>
The Landons owned the property for about 10 years. "They bought the ranch as a 
place to relax and spend time with the horses and the children," Earl said. 
"They didn't anticipate that it would become their home, but as we designed the 
plans, it developed from a ranch to an estate that has the Old Bel-Air or 
Pasadena look." 
</P>
<P>
Earl wouldn't say what the completed estate cost, but other industry sources 
estimated it at about $7 million. The Landons sold their Malibu Colony home for 
a little more than $5 million to producer/department-store heir Ted Field. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL LEESON, co-producer and screenwriter for the hot new film "The War of 
the Roses," novelist SIDNEY SHELDON and entertainment execs ALAN LADD JR. and 
ROBERT A. DALY have all been involved in sizable sales or purchases that 
already closed escrow this year. 
</P>
<P>
Leeson bought a two-story, 11-room house with a pool in Beverly Hills for 
$4,525,000, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
Ladd sold his Beverly Hills home for close to his $4.25-million asking price to 
an international investor, represented by Lila Bina of Nourmand &amp; 
Associates. Ladd, chairman of Pathe Entertainment, bought another house nearby 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon sold the Holmby site where he once planned to build a house to a 
stockbroker. The new owner has submitted plans to the city to build a large 
estate, said Myra Nourmand, who represented both parties in what other sources 
said was a $5.5-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
And Robert A. Daly, CEO and chairman of Warner Bros., and his wife, Nancy, 
bought the Holmby Hills house built in 1938 for actress CONSTANCE BENNETT and 
her then-husband, actor GILBERT ROLAND, for $9.25 million, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
The 17,432-square-foot mansion, also owned at one time by actress LORETTA 
YOUNG, was sold by the estate of auto heiress Lydia Morrison, who had updated 
the house with the help of L.A. architect Jeff Sulkin. Kay Pick at Mike 
Silverman &amp; Associates and Chrys Stamatis of Douglas Properties had the 
$12.4-million listing. 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTINA CRAWFORD, who wrote the 1984 bestseller "Mommie Dearest" about her 
relationship with movie-legend JOAN CRAWFORD, has put the Tarzana home where 
she wrote the book on the market at $999,950. 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote the '81 book "Black Widow" and '88 book "Survivor" at the 
30-year-old, gated estate, where she has lived for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford has decided to move to Seattle because many of her Southern California 
friends already relocated there, said a spokeswoman for Fred Sands Realtors. 
Martha McGee and Mariette Kaprielian with Sands' Tarzana office have the 
listing on the one-acre property, which has four bedrooms, three baths, a guest 
house, swimming pool and fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
DON SIMPSON, a producer of "Top Gun," is razing an old house in Bel-Air to 
build a 12,000-square-foot home he describes as a "contemporary Craftsman." 
</P>
<P>
He bought the 2-acre site near RONALD and NANCY REAGANS' home at the beginning 
of last year for about $7 million in cash. The land is worth more than $8 
million now, says Heidi Lake of Fred Sands Estates, who represented Simpson in 
the purchase.

HOW TO AVOID PAYING TAXES WHEN SELLING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virtually every homeowner has heard that there is a way to avoid paying taxes 
when selling the principal residence at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the details are often elusive and misunderstood. One costly mistake, 
and the tax you thought you were avoiding can become due. 
</P>
<P>
Internal Revenue Code 1034, the "roll-over residence replacement rule," is 
quite simple. It says a home seller must defer paying tax on the sale profit if 
a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost is bought and 
occupied within 24 months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
This tax benefit is available to home sellers of any age. It can be used over 
and over without limit. However, it cannot be used more often than once every 
24 months. But this rule can be used again within less than 24 months if the 
home sale involves a job location change that qualifies for the moving-expense 
deduction. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp homeowners will readily see that they can use IRC 1034 to pyramid their 
wealth, starting out with a small home such as a cottage, selling it and buying 
a more expensive home, and then selling that home and buying a mansion, all 
without paying tax on the profit. 
</P>
<P>
All that matters are your old residence's net sales price (in tax talk it's 
called "adjusted sales price") and the replacement home's adjusted cost basis, 
which includes most closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if your old home sells for $108,000, but you only receive $100,000 
after paying the real estate sales commission, transfer fees and closing costs, 
then $100,000 is your adjusted, or net, sales price. To defer the tax on your 
sale profit, you must buy a replacement home costing at least $100,000, 
including closing costs paid on the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you acquire a less expensive replacement home, such as one for 
$90,000, in this example you would owe tax on up to $10,000 of your sale 
profit. But tax on any remaining profit is deferred. However, if you add at 
least $10,000 of capital improvements to your new $90,000-home within the 
24-month replacement period, thus bringing your total purchase cost over 
$100,000, then you can defer tax on all your profit. 
</P>
<P>
Please notice the rules say nothing about mortgages or about cash down 
payments. If you want to take tax-free cash out of the sale and replacement, 
the best way to do so is to sell your old home for cash and buy the replacement 
home for nothing down, such as with a VA mortgage. You can spend the tax-free 
cash as you wish. 
</P>
<P>
This roll-over residence replacement rule is a very generous tax break. It 
allows home sellers to put tax-free cash into their pocket as they move up to 
nicer homes. However, this tax deferral rule has several pitfalls to anticipate 
and avoid: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- If either the old or new home is not your principal residence, IRC 1034 
does not apply. Vacation or second homes and rental houses are not eligible. If 
you own a rental house that you would like to qualify, before selling it, move 
into that house as your principal residence. The tax law does not specify any 
minimum occupancy time but most tax advisers suggest a minimum six to 12 
months, preferably filing your income tax returns for at least one tax year 
from that address. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- A currently owned home cannot qualify because it is not purchased within 
24 months before or after the sale of the old home. For example, if you own a 
summer home that you want to winterize and move into as your principal 
residence, it won't qualify unless you bought it within 24 months before or 
after selling your principal residence. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- There is no provision in this tax law for extension of the 24-month 
replacement period. If you have not purchased your replacement home within 24 
months after selling your old home, you will owe tax on your sale profit. The 
only exceptions occur if you are on active military duty or if you are residing 
overseas; then the time limits can be extended if you qualify. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- If your old or replacement home is outside the United States, you can 
still defer your profit tax because IRC 1034 sets no geographical limits. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- If you live in one apartment of a multiunit building that you own, the tax 
deferral only applies to the profitable sale of your personal residence 
apartment, and you will owe tax on the sale profit on the rental apartments. 
Similarly, if you are acquiring an apartment building, only the value of the 
apartment where you will reside counts as the replacement home's cost, not the 
value of the entire property. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- When April 15 arrives and your 1989 income tax returns are due, if you 
have not yet purchased your replacement home you can still defer your profit 
tax on the 1989 sale of your old home. Just report the sale on IRS form 2119 
and indicate that you plan to buy a qualifying replacement principal residence. 
However, if you do not buy a home within 24 months after the sale, you will owe 
the tax plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
For most taxpayers, the roll-over residence replacement rule is the most 
generous tax-saving rule available. While IRC 1034 is simple, your tax adviser 
should be consulted so you don't make a costly mistake.

REMODELER'S DIARY: A YEAR IN THE PLANNING, LET THE REMODELING BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN HEYES, Heyes is a Times copy editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The home wreckers have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
They have attacked our house with sledgehammers, shovels, chain saws and 
machines I couldn't begin to identify. 
</P>
<P>
Our office is gone. Those hideous junipers -- gone. The front porch -- gone. 
</P>
<P>
Our inviolable sanctuary -- gone. 
</P>
<P>
We are depressed. And thrilled. We hastily moved out over a weekend, skeptical 
about our contractor's promise that work could begin that Monday on our 
long-planned remodel. But good as his word, "Hans" had a crew there bright and 
early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our house is broken," my 2-year-old declared when he saw two days' worth of 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," I explained, "and the construction workers are going to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
"The 'struction workers break our house. And then they fix it," he summarized. 
That about captured it. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third day, they were throwing pieces of our house into a 
dumpster, that trendy Westside status symbol. We knew we had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here hasn't been easy. For almost a year, we worked with an architect, 
"Frank," on plans to add a third bedroom and a second bathroom and enlarge the 
tiny living room of our Mar Vista house. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Frank's ideas were marvelous; a few were not to our liking. Often we 
were sorely tempted to throw up our hands and say, "Fine, do what you want, 
let's just get on with it already." But we knew that time spent getting the 
drawings just right would prove to be time well spent. 
</P>
<P>
Then came negotiations with the contractors to whittle bids of $146,000 to 
$197,000 down into our $100,000-max range. Frank earned his money here, 
scrutinizing bids, bullying bidders. 
</P>
<P>
He identified flat-out errors -- such as the inclusion of air conditioning, a 
pricey shower door or a sewer line that were not in the plans -- and brought 
the lowest bid down to $131,000. Then there were some oh-come-on cuts, where 
Frank got the contractor to agree that it wouldn't really cost that much. 
Result: $122,435. 
</P>
<P>
Then we all sat down together. 
</P>
<P>
Out went the 15-by-6-foot deck, for a saving of $1,000. Out went the built-in 
shelves in the study and the laundry room ($1,000). Prefab cabinets in the 
bathroom and hall replaced custom-made ($2,000). 
</P>
<P>
Tile vanished from three bathroom walls and the floor became vinyl ($1,850). 
Our allowance for bathroom faucets was cut ($1,000). A less expensive brand of 
windows was called for ($1,625), and a lesser grade of wood siding ($2,000). 
This meant that Hans' overhead and profit dropped by $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Final bid, after other small adjustments: $109,280. Not including general 
liability insurance, new driveway and walks, landscaping, permits, light 
fixtures, window treatments, carpeting. Not to mention apartment rent during 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Can we afford it? No. Can we turn back now? No. 
</P>
<P>
I have nothing but admiration for people -- like others who have written in 
this space -- who can do their own remodeling. How nice it must be to have the 
time to educate oneself enough to be able to do a job such as tiling or wiring 
or plumbing competently. 
</P>
<P>
We briefly (very briefly) considered doing our own general contracting after we 
saw the first bids. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know anything about building a house?" my husband asked. I had to admit 
I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither do I," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you have to frame and wire and plumb," I countered intelligently. "How 
tough can it be?" 
</P>
<P>
His withering look answered me. A more economically and emotionally sound 
strategy for us, we agreed, was to work at the jobs we know how to do and make 
the money to pay trained professionals to do the jobs they know how to do. 
</P>
<P>
A colleague who has nearly finished a huge remodel on his home put it this way: 
"A long time ago I made a deal with plumbers. I won't do plumbing if they won't 
do newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
The roller coaster ride has begun. 
</P>
<P>
For six days, Hans' crew worked like lightning, ripping out trees, tearing down 
walls, digging trenches and building foundation forms. And on the seventh day, 
work stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hans scheduled carelessly? Because the workers were tired? Because they 
struck oil under our house? 
</P>
<P>
No. Work screeched to a halt because the city inspector came by to look at the 
foundation trenches and said, Hum, I wonder if these trenches are too close to 
the property line? Just out of idle curiosity, let's find out. (This according 
to our architect.) 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Let's delay the project for almost a week to do a survey and make 
the strapped homeowners spend a few hundred dollars on same. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has not been our friend. When we submitted our plans for city 
approval, Frank told us the drawings could conceivably be OKd over the counter, 
since we are not adding a second story. 
</P>
<P>
But no. It seems our perfectly flat lot is in what the city considers a 
hillside zone. They tacked a notice on the tree out front. They notified our 
neighbors by mail for goodness sake and invited public comment. Six weeks 
later, we had a building permit. I don't know if anyone offered any comment. I 
wish the building department had asked me. 
</P>
<P>
In any case . . . a surveyor was hired, the trenches were just fine the way 
they were, the inspector signed off on it and concrete was poured within hours. 
</P>
<P>
So each day, we visit our wrecked house and envision the nice home it will 
become. And each night, we huddle in our apartment and remember why we bought a 
house in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the fear that we will be burglarized, as another tenant was the 
first week we were in the apartment. Or the tuneless music and bloodless moans 
that told us our next-door neighbors were watching a porno movie at 2 a.m. Or 
the delicate footfall overhead that prompted my son to speculate, "Dumbo is on 
the roof!" 
</P>
<P>
Or even the fact that this 2-year-old cannot be allowed to simply throw 
tantrums in peace because those same neighbors have to listen to them. 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK, that's all part of it. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not forget the laundry that has to be schlepped down to the garage 
along with six (yes, six) quarters per load, only to sit around for hours until 
an empty machine can be snagged. Or the dinky kitchen that won't hold our 
refrigerator or breakfast table (both are in the living room). Or the utter 
lack of storage space in the unit -- as if it was never meant as a place where 
anyone would live for very long. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. Home is where the closets are. 
</P>
<P>
And our home, closets and all, is broken for a while.

BACKGROUND Writer-remodeler Eileen Heyes kicked off this intermittent series on 
remodeling Sept. 3. In a second part on Nov. 5, she recounted the frustrating 
delays in getting the project under way, with still no acceptable bid 
forthcoming from a contractor.

TAKE TIME TO SETTLE

In "Know Your Rights, Obligations If Home Is Damaged by Fire" (Dec. 31), Merle 
Henkenium wrote: "Don't settle before knowing extent of cost." That is 
certainly a rule that should be followed. 
</P>
<P>
We had extensive water damage a few years ago and learned that water damage is 
insidious and doesn't always show up right away! Our insurance agent was 
anxious to settle our claim as quickly as possible, and we finally agreed, not 
realizing that we would no longer be covered when other water-damage problems 
surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Our rugs were soaked, and the insurance company had a rug cleaning service dry 
them out. But within a year, we discovered that water-soaked rugs cannot be 
fixed with drying. . . . The backings fell to pieces and the rugs had to be 
replaced. Ceilings were repainted but the paint kept peeling off because the 
water had softened the base. We ended up having to re-stucco, tile or have 
acoustical ceiling texture applied, though this was not our decorating choice.

WHY REALTOR HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an ex-realtor and now owner of a mortgage company, I take exception to 
Robert J. Bruss' reply Dec. 17 to the person who asked: "How to Avoid 
Overpaying for a Home." 
</P>
<P>
He's right on everything except the reply about financial information the 
realtor has a right to know. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By getting vital information regarding the buyer's finances, the agent not 
only saves his valuable time but the valuable time of the buyer as well. 
Knowing what the buyer can and cannot afford will surely dictate what 
properties to preview and then show the buyer. The majority of buyers have an 
over-inflated idea of what they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many times, buyers intentionally or not misrepresent their financial and 
credit background to someone pre-qualifying them. A seller has the right to 
know that someone has done his homework in regard to a potential buyer's 
qualification before they ask that seller to maintain, vacate and prepare their 
home for a potential viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the responsibility of the realtor to represent his client (seller) in 
all areas in the sale of a home. This includes such questions as: What type of 
work is your buyer in? What is his income? How long has he been employed? Does 
he have a house to sell? Where is the source of the down payment? How long has 
the money been in the bank? Can it be verified? Does the spouse work? Do they 
need both incomes to qualify? Has their credit been verified? Have they been 
pre-qualified by a lender? Who is the lender representative, and what is the 
name of his/her company? 
</P>
<P>
If these questions cannot be answered, then the selling agent hasn't done his 
job. There's no way a listing agent should recommend a seller tie his home up 
with an offer waiting for all of these questions to be answered -- let alone 
get into an escrow without knowing these answers. This is called "full 
representation" -- doing a thorough job for the seller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The buyer saves time. Your realtor can now do a little pre-qualifying (any 
good realtor should be able to do this with a little training and simple 
formulas), and then preview the homes that are truly in the buyer's price 
range. On occasion, there are multiple offers on homes. The agents who have 
done their homework best and have brought in a competitive offer will usually 
win out. 
</P>
<P>
On a single offer presentation, realtors who have done their homework have a 
better opportunity in negotiating price and other terms because the seller and 
listing agent feel more comfortable that they have a good buyer.

AIA PRESIDENT OUTLINES AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year the incoming president of the Los Angeles chapter of the American 
Institute of Architects announces an ambitious agenda that includes a slate of 
new programs and old programs revitalized. And every year, achievements fall 
short of the president's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
This year will be different, said newly installed LA/AIA president Raymond L. 
Gaio. Announcing a host of fresh initiatives designed to make the chapter more 
effective both in its internal organization and its public outreach, Gaio is 
poised to galvanize his 2,000-plus membership during his one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the decade of the '90s, let us strive to be positive, perceptive 
and conceptual," Gaio exhorted his board of directors in his first official 
memo. "Through open debate let us reach consensus so that LA/AIA can progress, 
serve, assist and be a positive influence on and contributor to both the 
membership and the public." 
</P>
<P>
Gaio's main thrust is to urge architects to look beyond themselves, to provide 
leadership in helping resolve conflicts generated by issues such as growth, 
development and concern for the urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
"In an arena filled with interest groups ranging from developers to community 
activists, most of whom spend much of their time screaming and yelling at one 
another, architects can play a valuable peacemaking role based on their 
professional expertise and their commitment to making Los Angeles a better 
place to live," Gaio wrote. 
</P>
<P>
These brave words are backed up by several new programs Gaio has proposed to 
the chapter. These include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A long-range planning committee that will survey the membership and 
anticipate developments and initiatives needed during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The establishment of neighborhood assistance teams that will help community 
groups clarify their concerns over development in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Creating biannual public forums on the environment in which a wide range of 
experts from many fields would debate ways to enhance the social and aesthetic 
health of the greater Los Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Develop international contacts, particularly with architects in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, to encourage the exchange of information. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Setting up local AIA committees within the city's 15 councilmanic 
districts, to give each area a greater sense of representation and bolster the 
identity of members in the less affluent sections of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Organize a "Mentors' Hotline" of retired AIA members to advise younger 
architects faced with challenges such as setting up a new practice, picking a 
professional partner or surviving a mid-life career crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gaio believes that his term in office, though brief, has several advantages 
that will make his programs more effective than those proposed by his 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, we've moved our offices from the Pacific Design Center to the Wiltern 
Building on Wilshire Boulevard, a more central location," Gaio said. "Secondly, 
we have a strong new staff in place, headed by executive director Christine 
Meyer. Thirdly, we have a new board that reflects the demographic diversity of 
Los Angeles. This board is young and includes several women and members of 
minority groups, mirroring the fact that our chapter membership in now 60% 
comprised of minorities and women." 
</P>
<P>
Although not a practicing architect, Gaio has a long record of service to the 
profession. Following graduation from the University of Notre Dame, Gaio 
organized the AIA's national "Grassroots" programs designed to improve the 
leadership skills of the Institute's state and chapter presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Currently Gaio heads his own management consultant firm that advises architects 
and related professionals in the operation and marketing of their services. 
</P>
<P>
This wide experience in dealing with the profession gives Gaio a refreshing 
frankness in confronting the local chapter's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Designers have not made their voices heard where it counts in Los Angeles 
because they've often been reluctant to take stands that might imperil their 
client relationships," he said. "This is a very shortsighted view, that 
diminishes our repute in the community. Architects, who care deeply about the 
city, have to stand up and be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Gaio rounds out his credo with a quote from his father, that he would like to 
adopt as the LA/AIA's slogan for the 1990s: "You're put on earth to do more 
than just breathe the air."

A VERY TALL STORY ABOUT A BEANSTALK 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<DATELINE>

PORTLAND, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last spring, Minnie Katherine Pomerinke planted beans. Brand-name seeds. 
Nothing magic. 
</P>
<P>
"Green beans is all I can tell you," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all they were." 
</P>
<P>
The beans grew past the top of her one-story house, with leaves the size of pie 
pans. 
</P>
<P>
Minnie Pomerinke, 77, says she has planted a vegetable garden every year since 
she was 18. But she says she has never seen a bean like the one she planted 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
She recounted her steps. 
</P>
<P>
"I mixed two bags of steer manure and one bag of chicken manure. I just dug 
holes with a trowel, and I put a trowel full of the mix in each hole, and I 
filled it up with water, and then I put my seeds in it." 
</P>
<P>
They sprouted and climbed her house. "I thought, 'Geez, it's getting higher and 
higher.' So I said to myself, 'Use 'em.' So I got a stick and stuck it up there 
above the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
She called the library. She wanted to know whether her bean stalk was the 
tallest recorded bean stalk in the United States or the world. She told the 
librarian that the stalk was 15 feet and climbing. 
</P>
<P>
Each season she spends 20 or 30 hours a week working her garden. It is about 3 
feet wide and it wraps almost around her house. Harvests include cherry 
tomatoes, peppers, onions, chard and cucumbers nearly 20 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
The beans, though, are why she phoned the library. The librarian found what is 
believed to be the world's longest lima bean, but they're still looking for an 
entry about the world's tallest stalk of beans.

REMODELING: TIPS TO GETTING A GOOD CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM DIECKMEYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many homeowners planning to remodel make a common mistake: They spend more time 
gathering ideas for their remodeling project than checking out the contractor 
they hire to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
Because your home usually is your most valuable asset, make the best remodeling 
investment by selecting a reliable contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that remodeling is a service, not a product. It's easy to buy a 
product. We can evaluate one item against a similar item, comparing price, 
features, appearance, etc., before making our selection. 
</P>
<P>
While remodeling a kitchen involves many different products, appliances and 
materials, it is really a service. The remodeler is not offering you a kitchen 
out of the box, direct from the manufacturer. He is offering the expertise, 
experience and reputation to build a kitchen that meets your family's needs and 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a good remodeler requires diligent investigation before signing the 
contract and handing over a check for the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
You must decide, before price becomes a factor, that the remodeler has the 
credentials to deliver the professional service you have a right to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some guidelines to follow in doing your homework: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How long has the company been in business? It usually takes at least five 
years to establish a financially sound business. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the contractor licensed? Remodelers in California must have a general 
contractor's license if they perform work (labor and/or material) valued at 
$300 or more in any trade for which the Contractors State License Board 
requires a license (such as electrical, plumbing, heating/air conditioning, 
etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the contractor have a permanent business location and a phone where 
you can reach him or her? Don't accept a business card as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does your local consumer affairs agency, the California Contractors State 
License Board or the Better Business Bureau have a record of unsolved 
complaints against the company or the principal of the firm? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the remodeler have proof of workmen's compensation and general 
liability insurance? If not, you may be liable for any construction-related 
accidents or damages on your premises. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will the contractor provide you with names of previous customers? Ask for 
references of completed jobs similar to the one you are planning. If the 
company specializes in decks, you probably don't want to hire them to do their 
first room addition. Ask previous customers if they would hire the same 
contractor again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have you seen the contractor's work in person, both in progress and 
completed? Check for quality of workmanship and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are you able to communicate easily with the contractor? Misunderstandings 
during a project can cause delays and cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you feel comfortable with the contractor? Remember, your family will be 
in close contact with him and you will share your home with the crew until the 
project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will the contractor provide you with a complete and clearly written 
contract that you can understand (without needing an attorney to interpret it 
for you)? See if the contract includes a written warranty that covers 
workmanship and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never overpay your contractor. Never advance your contractor more dollars 
than the value of work he has performed. Pay only for work that has been 
completed or materials that have been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
This is a state law. Beware of a contractor who wants more than 10%, or $1,000 
(whichever is less), as a down payment or one who asks for a larger draw than 
the work completed to date. 
</P>
<P>
Credentials that indicate a remodeler's reliability are membership in a trade 
organization such as the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California 
(BIA/SC), professional certification such as the certified graduate remodeler 
(CGR) or certified kitchen designer (CKD), and an insured warranty such as the 
home owners warranty (HOW), which covers the completed job up to five years 
against construction defects and failures. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem like a lot of work just to check out a remodeler, but doing your 
homework pays off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Dieckmeyer is president of the Remodelers Council of the Building Industry 
Assn. of Southern California (BIA/SC). While readers' questions cannot be 
answered individually, those of general interest will be addressed in this 
column. Please send your remodeling questions to BIA/SC Remodelers Council,

NEW COLUMN Homeowners in greater Los Angeles spent almost $1 billion on 
remodeling, home improvements and repairs in 1989. To meet the increasing 
demand for consumer information on remodeling, the Real Estate section 
introduces today a monthly remodeling column written by Jim Dieckmeyer, the 
president of the Remodelers Council of the Building Industry Assn. of Southern 
California. The column will address major topics of interest to homeowners 
considering a minor or major remodeling project and will answer general 
questions.

BUILD A TOOL BOX THAT REFLECTS PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. PRESUTTI, Presutti is a Stanton Island, N.Y. free-lancer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first became interested in carpentry, one of the things I admired most 
about the old-timers was the style and creativity that went into their wooden 
tool boxes. These personalized accessories were built to last a lifetime and 
often did. They were all customized to fit the needs of their creators. 
</P>
<P>
If he was a framing carpenter, the box was large enough to carry large nails 
and an extra 22-ounce hammer and a caulk line. One box I recall seeing in an 
old carpenter's shop looked more like an autobiography than a tool box. 
</P>
<P>
It had slews of calculations inscribed in lead, saw kerfs ripped across it, 
glue spots on it, drill holes poked into it and coffee stained into its grain, 
all of these footprints of a carpenter's career. 
</P>
<P>
There was probably the calculation he figured twice before cutting his first 
roof, and the coffee spilled while in his truck waiting to start working on a 
cold gray February morning when the rest of the world was still fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
I'm going to share with you some of the techniques I use to build my customized 
wooden tool boxes. I've built quite a collection over the years for friends, 
family and myself. I may even be lucky enough to have this column reach a young 
carpenter who is just starting his own autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically two types of tool boxes: open and closed. An open box is a 
box without a lid. I use these to store materials that are frequently used such 
as nails, screws or tubes of caulking. Since the box is always open you can see 
everything in it at once without opening a lid. I have one open box I use just 
for my finish nails, aluminum capping nails, large dry wall screws and spare 
tubes of silicone caulking. 
</P>
<P>
I also store extra pencils there and extra screw gun bits. I call this my "trim 
box" because I use it when I do trim work. Another open box, a very large one, 
I call my "framing box." This stays in my truck and contains seven different 
compartments, each with various size framing nails in it. 
</P>
<P>
The second type of tool box is a closed box which I use to store my tools. 
Wooden tool boxes are great for tools because they cushion the blows and absorb 
any excess moisture in the air that can ruin an electronic motor. I have a 
wooden tool box for almost all of my tools. Sometimes I make a tool box that 
houses all the tools needed to perform a particular task -- like a box that 
only has electrician tools or laminating tools. The possibilities are endless, 
and if you're like me, you'll just enjoy making them. 
</P>
<P>
I usually use plywood for large boxes and clear 1-x-6,8,10,12-inch board for 
smaller boxes. With a closed tool box, I first create a six-sided box, then 
with a table saw cut the top of the box off, seal it to protect it, add hinges 
and a handle, and then put it to work. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound fairly simple but there are a few tricky joints to mill to 
assure the box's long life. First mill the four sides of the would-be box. Make 
sure they're square and all the same height. Now run a router with a 
three-quarter-inch bit through the bottom on each side; this creates a dado 
joint (see figure). Sometimes it's easier if you run the router through a 
single long piece of wood first then cut the sides. This is up to you and the 
supply of wood available. 
</P>
<P>
Now cut the bottom of the box. Make it long enough to be accepted into the dado 
groove on each side of the box. Then put the five sides of the box together 
dry. This is to check the fit and tightness. While it's still together measure 
the top. It should be the length of the long side plus the width of the two 
short sides (see figure). Now cut the top of the box to whatever size you 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
After you have the top cut, you're going to route a rabbet joint around the 
perimeter of it. This is done so that the top will fit (partially) into the 
box. This will assure a strong joint. 
</P>
<P>
Put all six sides (four sides plus top and bottom) together dry. Check them 
again, then disassemble it, glue it and reassemble it. Clamp every corner joint 
and fasten them together with wood screws or nails. Take caution here not to 
screw (or nail) where you plan to cut later. Leave it clamped and screwed for 
at least 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Once dried you will have a six-sided box. Now measure down about 3 inches and 
make a mark for your cut. Run the box through a table saw (or use a circular 
saw), and create the top lid. Prime and seal the whole box and install the 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
To build an open tool box just use the same procedures used to build a closed 
tool box except omit the top lid and add a railing handle (see figure). 
</P>
<P>
Remember, when you create a custom tool box, add personal touches that 
distinguish your box from others. Like the carpenters who use them, tool boxes 
are all different, and should be. Let your tool box reflect you personally. 
Dare to be unique.

There's no doubt about it: A glut of new homes, coupled with single-digit 
mortgage rates, has made this one of the best times to purchase a new house in 
several years.

But to maximize your savings, you'll need to do some research and also brush up 
on your bargaining tactics.

Negotiating for a new home is different than negotiating for an older house, 
and in some ways it's more complicated. With the plethora of new homes 
currently on the market, you probably won't just be haggling over the price -- 
you may also be able to dicker for free upgrades, cut-rate financing or other 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Location, of course, should be a primary consideration; so should your 
satisfaction with the home itself. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've zeroed in on an area that you like, check out all the new 
developments and see which ones offer the best quality, design, floor plans and 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to be thorough, you can ask salespeople at each tract for 
the names of other projects that the builder has completed and then visit 
homeowners in those communities to see whether they've had good experiences 
with both their builder and their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Also ask yourself whether each new tract is laid out smartly. Can you enter the 
development and get to your house easily, or do you have to make your way 
through a maze of streets to find your front door? Are there enough street 
lights, trees and open space to make you feel comfortable and secure? 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking to maximize your home's appreciation potential, it's usually 
best to avoid buying the most expensive home in the tract, said Joe Gallagher, 
an executive with builder Leisure Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, consider buying one of the mid-priced or least-expensive models. Its 
value will likely be pulled up by the value of the more expensive properties 
that surround it. It's what real estate experts call the "theory of 
progression." 
</P>
<P>
There is one exception to this rule: If you're buying a home in a 
recreation-oriented community chock-full of golf courses, lakes, parks or other 
amenities, it's generally best to pick the unit that has the best view you can 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
People who move into these communities put a high priority on such items and 
are usually willing to pay a premium for a good view or closer proximity to the 
golf course or lake. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what kind of concessions you can get -- and how big those bonuses will 
be -- often depends on how many finished homes the developer has available. 
</P>
<P>
If you go to a tract where there are relatively few homes for sale, you might 
get some type of "builder's close-out" bonus such as a price discount, but room 
for negotiating other concessions will probably be limited. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "if you go to a development where the builder has several 
dozen completed homes, you'll probably have more room to bargain," Gallagher 
said. "Builders don't like to have empty houses because their carrying costs 
are so high." 
</P>
<P>
Most developers are reluctant to reduce their asking prices, but many are 
willing to provide upgrades at little or no cost. 
</P>
<P>
"If you see something like upgraded appliances or mirrored walls in the model, 
ask if you can get them in your home for no charge," said Robert J. Bruss, a 
syndicated real estate columnist. 
</P>
<P>
"If the builder has a choice between giving you a few thousand dollars in free 
upgrades or losing a sale, most will give you the upgrades." 
</P>
<P>
Some salespeople will tell you that the builder is willing to make concessions 
the moment you walk into their office. Others won't offer any deals unless you 
ask if there's room to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
As with most other types of negotiation, even builders admit that it's 
typically not a good idea to seem too excited about buying the house. If the 
salesperson figures that you're hooked on the home, he'll probably be less 
inclined to lower the asking price or provide some other type of incentive. 
</P>
<P>
It can, however, pay dividends to tell the salesperson all you can about your 
personal financial situation. If you like a particular home but can't sell your 
current house, some builders will offer to cut their asking price if you offer 
to cut yours by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Other builders might offer a cash bonus to any realtor who produces a buyer for 
your current home, while others might provide a large rebate when you close 
escrow to help you through a cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to sell you a home, but we can't help you if we don't know what your 
problems are," said Dan Brumlik, a vice president with builder SBA Industries. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it's price discounts, cut-rate loans, free upgrades or credits to use 
at the builder's design center, do your best to figure out the true value of 
the discount that you're offered. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you're offered a $10,000 price discount or $10,000 in credit 
that can be used for nice drapes or wallpaper at the builder's design center, 
it's usually better to take the price cut. 
</P>
<P>
That's because most builders put a retail markup on their upgrades and 
design-center items. You might get $10,000 in fancier drapes and other items, 
but their wholesale value could be less than $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also think about what you're willing to do and what you're willing to pay for. 
For example, builders sometimes charge several thousand dollars for a 
landscaping job -- something you might be able to accomplish by spending a few 
hundred dollars on plants and a weekend of your time. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually figure out savings provided by cut-rate financing with the help 
of a loan-amortization book. Or, the salesperson can help you. 
</P>
<P>
First, get all the details on the loan that's offered by the builder, and then 
calculate your payment using the amortization book. Then, find out what rates 
and terms are being offered by other lenders and determine your payment based 
on their loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
Remember though, that most builder's discount financing programs last only for 
a limited time -- typically from six months to three years. That's why it's so 
important to know exactly how the builder's loan program works: If you 
calculate your savings assuming that the builder's low rate will last forever, 
but later find out that it converts to market rate in three years, you won't 
have an accurate idea of how much you'll really save.

SPEAKING OUT: TITLE INSURANCE KEEPS NASTY SURPRISES AT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. WEISSMAN, Weissman is a Los Angeles area attorney whose practice 
emphasizes real estate and creditors' rights law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You found your dream home. It meant forgoing vacations, nights on the town and 
a new car, but you managed to finally come up with the down payment and a 
mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
Before signing on the various dotted lines, you scan the list of closing costs 
and notice a charge for title insurance. In fact, after points and prepaid 
mortgage interest, title insurance is your largest closing expense. 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers may grumble about buying yet another insurance policy, but without 
title insurance, they run the risk of having to pay past-due bills or taxes 
left behind by the previous owner or even face the possibility of losing their 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
I recently handled a case where a young couple moved into their home, only to 
find a $5,000-property tax bill was left unpaid by the seller. Since the home 
buyers had title insurance, their insurer paid the taxes. My job was to sue the 
seller for reimbursement for the title insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
When property changes hands, all encumbrances not paid through escrow are 
transferred to the new owner. If the buyers hadn't purchased title insurance, 
they would have been obligated to pay the $5,000-tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
This is where title insurance is invaluable. Title insurance generally 
indemnifies the purchaser of the policy that a property's title is free and 
clear of liens or encumbrances except for stated exceptions and exclusions. 
</P>
<P>
If an encumbrance later appears, as in the above example, the insurance company 
is required to either eliminate the encumbrance or pay for damages. Without 
title insurance, home buyers are on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Although California law does not require home buyers to purchase title 
insurance, the premiums are minimal (about 10% of closing costs) compared to 
the large monetary investment in the property. 
</P>
<P>
Also, lenders do not normally provide funding unless title insurance is 
purchased. The one-time premium not only includes a title check, but it 
protects you from unknown claims for as long as you own the property. 
</P>
<P>
About 125 title insurance companies are members of the California Land Title 
Assn. Of these, about 40 do business in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although most insurers offer similar coverage, the cost of title insurance can 
vary. Rates are filed with the state Department of Insurance and some are 
priced more competitively than others. 
</P>
<P>
By shopping around, a home buyer can save several hundred dollars in premium 
costs for the same dollar amount of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
If your new home has changed hands within two years before your purchase, ask 
for the insurer's "short-term rate." Since the title-searching process will not 
require as much time or leg work, these rates can be less. 
</P>
<P>
Who chooses your title insurance company? 
</P>
<P>
Most often, your real estate agent. Don't feel obligated to use his or her 
recommendation. Remember, your title insurance is in effect for as long as you 
own your home, while your relationship with your realtor is usually over soon 
after the moving van leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, you will never need an insurer's legal assistance over a disputed 
claim or unexpected lien, but you'll want to select an insurer with a proven 
track record, a reputation for service and one that offers prompt handling of 
claims if they do arise. 
</P>
<P>
To help you choose a good insurer, ask your real estate agent and local 
mortgage companies for the names of title insurers they regularly use. Then do 
some investigating on your own. 
</P>
<P>
To determine an insurer's financial stability, request fiscal statements that 
show levels of monetary reserves. Also, contact the state Department of 
Insurance in Sacramento, (800) 233-9045, to find out if the insurance company 
is licensed. And call the California Land Title Assn., (916) 444-2647, to learn 
if the insurer is an association member. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike casualty insurers, which assume risk when issuing policies, title 
insurers devote most of their efforts, and most of your premium payment, to 
researching a title -- to eliminate risk -- before issuing the policy. 
</P>
<P>
A title search can find: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Someone else, besides the seller, laying claim to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A third party's lien on the property to collect payment of a debt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A judgment against the seller or a prior owner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An easement running through the lot that the seller failed to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hundreds or even thousands of dollars of unpaid property taxes or liens. 
</P>
<P>
Title insurers have "title plants" containing millions of public documents. The 
insurance company's staff searches these records for "red flags." Title 
insurers normally issue a standard policy that ". . . fundamentally protects 
only against defects in the title, or encumbrances on the property which are 
disclosed by the 'public records.' " 
</P>
<P>
These records can include tax or assessment notices, easements and encroachment 
records and court judgments. 
</P>
<P>
After researching the property, the title insurer provides a preliminary report 
(usually paid for by the seller) listing any liens or encumbrances. The buyers' 
real estate agent then notifies the buyers of the report's findings. Most 
titles come up clean, but if a troubling lien appears, the buyers normally have 
three options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buy the property knowing a lien exists, and assume the obligation and risks 
of the lien. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiate with the seller and his or her real estate agent to clear the 
lien from the title. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancel the transaction. Buyers can legally back out of a deal if the seller 
fails to disclose all liens against the property. 
</P>
<P>
If a lien clouds the title and the buyers still want to purchase the home, the 
title company will usually issue a policy but will not agree to insure the 
detected lien. 
</P>
<P>
Once the preliminary report is accepted by the buyer, the insurer runs one more 
check on the day escrow closes just in case other liens have appeared since the 
preliminary report was completed. If everything is in order, a title insurance 
policy is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers review thousands of documents daily for Southern California property 
transactions. No system is infallible and human and computer error occasionally 
occur. As a piece of property is bought and resold, its lineage grows and 
chances for error or omissions increase. 
</P>
<P>
When an encumbrance slips through the review process and comes to light only 
after you have taken title to the property, your title insurance premium 
protects your interests up to the maximum of the face value of the policy 
(usually the mortgage amount). 
</P>
<P>
As the insured, you must notify the insurance company immediately upon learning 
of a claim against your property, or else under law, the insurer may not have 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
Once notified, the title insurer will determine if the claim is legitimate. If 
it is, the insurer will then pay off the claim, compensate the homeowners, or 
take the issue to court if there is a valid reason for objecting to the claim. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, an undetected claim on a property will affect the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
For example, upon submitting plans for a family room addition, the new owners 
are told an easement runs through the proposed construction site. In these 
cases, the title insurer may be required to financially compensate the owners 
against any resulting losses or hardship up to the total amount of the title 
insurance purchased. 
</P>
<P>
By transferring their property to new owners, some sellers believe they are no 
longer responsible for any undetected liens associated with their former 
property. This is not necessarily so. 
</P>
<P>
Although the title insurer may have to make good on the claims or remove the 
lien to satisfy its contractual obligation to the home buyers, the insurer has 
the legal right to seek out the seller and obtain reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, as new homeowners, you want to be assured that your home's plumbing 
and heating work and the roof doesn't leak, but these assurances are of little 
value if you do not also have the security of knowing your new home is free of 
legal encumbrances. Title insurance gives you that security.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: FACE LIFTS ON THE WAY FOR AGING BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW LOOKS: ONCE-POPULAR LOS ANGELES PROJECTS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR APPEAL ARE 
GETTING COSMETIC SURGERY TO BOOST THEIR BOTTOM LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. News releases and 
column inquiries should be mailed to 8306 Wilshire Blvd., No. 7078, Beverly 
Hills, Calif. 90211. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's inevitable. Time marches on, and we begin to forget the once-popular and 
sought-after. They've lost their good looks and we've lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
To recapture our attention, some may turn to a makeover, others will go as far 
as a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
What else is to be done with a once-popular building that's lost its appeal? 
Few commercial projects are lucky enough to age gracefully, so a little 
cosmetic surgery often makes for just the change needed to boost their bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenging problem that portends the future," said architect Thomas 
Landau. His Santa Monica-based firm is planning to re-create the 615 S. Flower 
building -- once the tallest office tower in downtown Los Angeles at 20 
stories. Today, the 30-year-old structure has to compete with buildings three 
times its height that are younger and more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The building isn't old enough to be considered much of a landmark and its 
design has lost its appeal to top-tier tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The answer: a new facade of travertine stone and reflective glass, rehabbed 
lobbies and a new entrance at 811 Wilshire Blvd. -- all at a cost of $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
What owners Treptow Development Co. and General Electric Investment Realty 
Partners want is a transformation similar to the one achieved at 655 S. Hope 
St. Former owner Hammerson Properties turned an eight-story, 1964 building into 
a 17-story tower, complete with a stepped facade and new entry. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 655 S. Hope is considered nearly new and tenants have been paying 
new-building prices for space. Since its face lift, the building has been more 
than 90% leased, a fact that doubtless has its "surgeons" pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Renovation work at the City National Bank Building at 606 S. Olive Street also 
boosted its occupancy in 1989, thanks to a new interior design and aggressive 
leasing headed up by owner Tishman Speyer Properties' former partner Carl 
Muhlstein. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Rexford Plaza in Beverly Hills was little more than a tired old office 
building three years ago. Occupancy now is well over 90% thanks to a new 
facade. Rents are up and the owners can afford to get more choosy about 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
And in Westwood, Tishman West Cos. is spending about $4 million on a new facade 
for the Tishman Midvale Building. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are starting to realize how important a face lift can be -- 
especially in Los Angeles. Last month, Mitsui Fudosan (U.S.A.) Inc. hosted a 
bash to herald the new main lobby opening at the AT&amp;T Center in downtown 
Los Angeles. Mitsui Fudosan has tried giving its tower a new interior look in 
an effort to keep its current tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo-based investor Dr. Ming Yu Tsai has finally come around to the need for a 
face lift at his now-infamous WCT Building just west of the Harbor Freeway on 
Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening three years ago, brokers have managed to lease only 10% of the 
building's 340,000 square feet of available office space. Fixtures and finishes 
at WCT are by no means old, but a rehab is planned nonetheless to create a new 
and, the owners hope, more successful image for the 37-story white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The World Chinese Trust logo atop the building is set to come down, steel 
hardware is being replaced with brass, oak doors are being replaced with 
mahogany, and new lighting and a friendlier lobby are planned. The rehab isn't 
a major one, but brokers for the project hope the changes will help quell 
critics who don't see any redeeming qualities at the 1100 Wilshire Blvd. 
building. 
</P>
<P>
As all of Southern California ages, expect to see more than just rehabbed 
office buildings. The trend is a popular one at hotels -- among them the 
Beverly Hilton, Regent Beverly Wilshire and the Biltmore. As of Jan. 31, the 
list will be joined by the Registry Hotel in Universal City. CIGNA Cos. 
announced plans last month to sell the 449-room hotel to the Tuntex Group, a 
Taiwan-based textile and petrochemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Tuntex will shutter the Registry and lay off all of its employees as it embarks 
on a renovation to boost low occupancy rates. The Registry Hotel Corp. will not 
be signed to continue management of the hotel -- hence a name change is 
expected too. 
</P>
<P>
As 1990 begins, retail rehabs are on line throughout the Southland. Santa 
Monica Place is gearing up for a transformation that will mean goodby for many 
longtime tenants. Management plans to focus on more upscale shoppers, and that 
means structural changes and a new mix of retailers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-Wilshire Plaza Sold to Korean Group 
</P>
<P>
Mid-Wilshire's Central Plaza was sold late last year to a group of Korean 
investors known as Zufu Properties Co. for an estimated $92 million to $100 
million. Selling the cluster of four 12-story buildings was a group headed by 
Heitman Properties Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Koreatown has expanded almost exponentially within the last decade, and Korean 
investment in Mid-Wilshire office buildings, predict local brokers, is a trend 
that's expected to accelerate in the 1990s. Investment money comes both from 
local Koreans who have made Mid-Wilshire their home and from Korea, where 
government officials recently relaxed foreign investment restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Other major Korean-owned office buildings along Wilshire Boulevard include the 
Korea Center and Wilshire Court Financial Building.

HER WORLD: RELIVING MEMORIES OF NORWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, of La Jolla, is a magazine and newspaper writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On this winter morning I am sipping coffee from a mug I bought in Oslo and 
thinking of Sven Nygaard. He is a Norwegian I met last August in an art gallery 
in the village of Geiranger. 
</P>
<P>
But he won't be there now. 
</P>
<P>
Sven was leaving Geiranger a couple of days after I did, closing Galleri 2-S 
for the season and returning to his other life as postmaster in the town of 
Stranda, which lies to the northwest, an hour and a half commute by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Galleri 2-S opened last May in an old frame-and-stone schoolhouse at the head 
of the fiord, just a thunder away from a mighty cascade that scores the 
mountainside. The gallery operates only on summer weekends and holidays, 
catering to tourists -- including Norwegians -- who flock to this pretty 
village. 
</P>
<P>
Among the artists shown is the innovative Marianne Heske, who dismantled a 
shepherd's wooden hut in Norway and reassembled it at the Centre Pompidou for 
the Paris Biennale exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Sven said that when French critics asked about the meaning of her project, 
Heske said: "I thought the hut would be regarded as a hut in Norway, whereas in 
Paris it would be seen as a manifestation of conceptual art." 
</P>
<P>
Of her vivid paintings, a Paris critic wrote: "Here is an artist who comes from 
the cold and returns willingly to it . . . if only to bring back picturesque 
landscapes of her native Norwegian West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
The hut was put back on its Norwegian site after the show and is used again for 
storing hay. "We are both avant-garde and traditional," Sven said. 
</P>
<P>
On this winter morning I am thinking also of the ruddy-cheeked Norwegian who 
drove our tour bus in the Lofoten Islands that lie north of the Arctic Circle. 
His real job is as a schoolteacher; the demands of tourism there are few. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged Lofotens have no tourist hotel. Most visitors arrive by ship and 
stay less than a day. Tenders shuttle from anchorage to shore. A cruise ship 
dock is under construction, however, in the town of Gravdal. And UNESCO funds 
have been incorporated in the restoration of cod fishermen's huts as tourist 
hostels. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there anybody of you who have Norwegians in their family?" the driver 
asked eagerly. "What? Not this time? That is unusual for Americans. There are 4 
million Norwegians living in Norway and 4 million more in the U.S.A. We have no 
family in the Lofotens without relatives in America." 
</P>
<P>
The Lofoten archipelago includes eight big islands and a scattering of small 
ones. It is a wild landscape of sheer, rocky mountains that seem tossed from 
the sea. It is home to a legendary cul-de-sac called Trollfjord, a challenge 
for ships and captains. 
</P>
<P>
I am thinking, too, on this winter morning, of the people of the hamlet of 
Undredal, which you can reach by ferry along the magnificent Sognefjord from 
Flam. The ferry runs twice a week between late June and late August. Undredal 
is known for its fine goat cheese and for its tiny village church built in 1147 
-- the smallest still in use in Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
In summer, Flam's Hotel Fretheim is banked with heavy crimson floribunda roses. 
Blue candles flicker on knotty pine tables in the sitting rooms. Fireplaces 
blaze most evenings of the year. 
</P>
<P>
I am thinking of the lecturer on our ship for this coastal cruise, who, even in 
August, wore a traditional Norwegian patterned cardigan knit by his aunt. The 
sweater had pewter buttons. I searched shop windows but never saw one quite 
like it.

"Self-discipline and self-reliance are national traits," the lecturer said, "as 
well as Henrik Ibsen's streak of melancholy. Norwegians avoid trends and 
excesses. They take at least one winter before making up their minds about any 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
I think of that as I sip my coffee, light my blue candle and listen to the 
A-minor piano concerto by Edvard Grieg. I vow -- by the first day of spring -- 
to check again on my family tree.

<P>
When Robert and Lynda Estes moved to this little seaside town as new owners of 
the Rossmount Inn, they walked through the rooms, removed all the pictures and 
banished them to the barn. 
</P>
<P>
After the couple tallied their money, they realized that new art was not in 
their budget. They then rehung the paintings they liked best. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, practicality took over at this New Brunswick inn. Also, a good sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
"TV's Bob Newhart Show has no relationship to running a country inn," Robert 
Estes said. He believes the British television series Fawlty Towers, which 
starred John Cleese as bumbling innkeeper Basil Fawlty, is closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year was really very frustrating and tiring," Estes said, "but the 
third is much better. We feel an emotional tie with the inn. In the first 
couple of years we were just custodians; now I find myself being prejudicial 
about who should stay here." 
</P>
<P>
The three-story inn, which has 16 bedrooms, each with its own bath, stands at 
the head of a long driveway off the road leading to St. Andrews from the 
Trans-Canada Highway. 
</P>
<P>
A swimming pool and deck are surrounded by fields of wildflowers and, in the 
distance, are tree-covered hills. The Esteses and their staff of 10, mostly 
college students, earned an Automobile Club Four Diamond award for the 
Rossmount in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the main hallway, two ornately carved wooden panels salvaged from a ship 
serve as massive door frames. Carved lintels, stained-glass panels and Oriental 
rugs set off the satin-toned wood. 
</P>
<P>
An elaborate wooden bar is framed with pewter and earthenware tankards. While 
no-smoking rules prevail in the dining room, desserts and coffee can be served 
in the bar or on the porch, where smoking is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Robert is manager, handyman, maitre d'hotel and bartender, while Lynda, who 
trained in Los Angeles, does the cooking. The menu changes frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"We change from blackberry season to raspberry season and then to rhubarb and 
such," she said. "We have swordfish in July and early August only, with the 
salmon just about gone by mid-July and lobster in season. One of the advantages 
is that New Brunswick is so small you can call the suppliers at home if you 
need something." 
</P>
<P>
The Rossmount opens in the spring and closes for the winter at the end of 
October. 
</P>
<P>
A little over a hour away is Kings Landing, a recreation of an historic village 
in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Costumed residents who have studied 
the history of each house and farm relocated here and the life stories of its 
original inhabitants populate the dwellings and fields, going about their 
routine chores while visitors area free to observe and ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
In Sackville, near the narrow strip of land connecting New Brunswick and Nova 
Scotia, Mary and John Blakely run the Marshlands Inn, a Victorian town home 
with a carriage house in the back and 25 rooms, some with private baths and 
some with shared facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Blakelys, from England, bought the century-old inn in 1984 after Mary had 
worked for the previous owners as a bookkeeper. John was a brewery chemist in 
England before moving to Canada and becoming a forensic toxicologist for the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
</P>
<P>
Running a country inn "is something we've always wanted to do," Mary said. 
"It's very hard on you -- you have to love it." Helping are two of the 
Blakely's four children. 
</P>
<P>
The family provides entertainment and parties for guests, including small-cast 
theater productions, mystery weekends and fashion show luncheons. The inn 
allows children and dogs ("We have some of both ourselves.") and permits 
smoking in some rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfasts consist of creamy old-fashioned oatmeal with brown sugar and cream, 
fresh-squeezed orange juice, kippers, eggs and Canadian bacon, thick slices of 
toasted homemade bread, gooseberry and rhubarb jam, buckwheat pancakes with 
real maple syrup and little pots of brewed tea instead of tea bags. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, guests sample Marshlands codfish cakes and poached eggs, homemade 
soups, sandwiches, salads, liver and onions or salt cod and pork scraps with 
whole boiled potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Sackville can see the only North American harness shop still 
producing handmade horse collars, go bird watching on the marshes, study the 
Tidal Bore, a fast-moving high tide on the Petitcodiac River, or pack a picnic 
lunch and set out for Bay of Fundy National Park. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 miles away, Gagetown is an old town southeast of Fredericton on the 
meandering Saint John River with a population of about 600, most of them 
artists and craftsmen. The notable Loomcrafters, who create handwoven tartans, 
linens, afghans, ties, aprons and cushions, open their studios from early May 
to the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
In Gagetown the six-room Victorian-style lodging called Steamers Stop Inn is, 
along with Rossmount and Marshlands, one of the historic Heritage Inns of New 
Brunswick. Each of its rooms is named for a steamboat or paddle-wheeler that 
once cruised the Saint John River. 
</P>
<P>
Lunches and dinners are served indoors or on a shady porch overlooking the 
river, and include local dishes such as cream of fiddlehead soup, fish chowder, 
Bay of Fundy scallops and old-fashioned chicken and dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
If you overnight here on a Friday, get up early the next morning and hurry over 
to Fredericton's Boyce Farmers Market for breakfast at New Brunswick's most 
unusual restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday morning from 7 a.m. to noon Ruth Chappell takes on the persona 
of a character called Goofy Roofy at a restaurant/eating stall of the same 
name. There she swaps wisecracks and insults with market vendors, politicians 
and visiting celebrities while she whips up her famous egg specialties. 
</P>
<P>
About 160 miles north, in the tiny seaside town of Nigadoo on the Acadian coast 
near Baie des Chaleurs, Hilda and Georges Franchon operate La Fine 
Grobe-Sur-Mer (fine grub by the sea). While the bay is famous for a ghost ship 
seen with sails aflame, the restaurant is renowned for Georges' French cuisine. 
He comes from Chambery in the Haut-Savoie region of France. His wife is an 
Acadian from New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
Some foods are prepared on an outdoor oven that is used for baking bread, 
roasting lamb and cooking Georges' Savoy-style scalloped potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the best dishes on the menu are lobster thermidor with onions, mushrooms 
and shallots, and a platter of steamed lobster, crab, scallops and shrimp 
napped in a lemony hollandaise and accompanied by spinach fresh from the 
Franchon's garden. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter Georges the chef turns into Georges the potter, Hilda returns to 
her painting and the inn becomes what it was originally -- a crafts center and 
school where the two of them teach art. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always more people eating three meals a day than buying art," 
Georges said. "So we said: 'Why not bring the customers in by their belly?' " 
</P>
<P>
Between courses, diners can browse among the gallery shelves that surround the 
dining room. The result is that more than one diner takes away an artistic as 
well as culinary remembrance from La Fine Grobe. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour's drive away is the Acadian Historical Village, another living 
history museum depicting the lives of Acadian settlers in the late 18th and 
early 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
At a fisherman's cottage, called the Godin house, you can talk to an actress 
playing the role of a housewife while she prepares a molasses cake and a beef 
fricot for the midday meal. 
</P>
<P>
You also can hold a freshly inked, handprinted, newspaper page made by a 
printer and watch as fresh codfish just unloaded from a fishing boat is cleaned 
and put on wooden racks to dry in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
If You Go: Rossmount Inn, St. Andrews by-the-Sea, (506) 529-3341, about $75 
double; Marshlands Inn, Sackville, (506) 536-0170, $60 double with private 
bath, $45 without; Steamers Stop Inn, Gagetown, (506) 488-2903, $40 double,

COULTERVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Gold Rush community has been designated a state historic landmark but it's 
no ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
Take the restored Jeffery Hotel, for example. Built in 1851, its best-known 
guest was President Theodore Roosevelt, who reportedly spent the night en route 
to Yosemite National Park at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Another park visitor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, also stayed at the Jeffery Hotel in 
its early days. That's when the main route to Yosemite was the Coulterville 
Turnpike, a toll road 10 miles north of town. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Yosemite-bound visitors traveling California's Mother Lode Highway 
should detour at Coulterville on scenic county road J20 as a short cut to the 
park entrance at Big Oak Flat. But don't rush through the village; stop to have 
a look around. 
</P>
<P>
Coulterville's Main Street has been named to the National Register of Historic 
Places, and there are 47 historic buildings and sites in town. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays only about 100 people live in Coulterville, but it was home to several 
thousand miners during its heyday, when there were 10 hotels and 25 saloons. 
Fires destroyed the main part of town three times in the 1800s, but the Jeffery 
Hotel was rebuilt atop its 2 1/2-foot-thick rock and adobe base after each 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Today it is Coulterville's only hotel and features the historic Magnolia 
Saloon, entered from the street through bat-wing doors. Visitors have been 
bellying up to its well-polished bar since the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
A back door goes to a patio and steps that lead to the top floor, where a new 
dinner theater is expected to have its debut this spring. A stairway at the 
hotel's main entrance leads to 20 guest rooms on the upper floors. 
</P>
<P>
Five rooms have private bath and cost $54 a night, double occupancy, through 
March. Eight shared baths serve the other rooms, which have winter rates of 
$43/$46. Continental breakfast is included. Call (209) 878-3471 for 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Across California 49 from the Jeffery are ruins of the Coulter Hotel, which was 
not rebuilt after the town's last great fire in 1899. It serves as part of the 
Northern Mariposa County History Center, which also is housed in a former Wells 
Fargo stage office next door. 
</P>
<P>
Photos and mementos from pioneer times and early mining days are displayed in 
the museum. In February it reopens on weekends from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. From 
April through August, visiting hours are daily except Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
Near the historic center, in the shade of Coulterville's Hanging Tree, you'll 
see a small wood-burning locomotive called Whistling Billy. It ran from a gold 
mine to a stamping mill over four miles of crooked track. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican miners were prospecting in the area in the 1850s when George Coulter 
arrived to set up a tent and sell supplies. He prospered enough to build a 
store, a family home and a hotel, and the town was named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
The Coulter Cafe was originally a family home, then a rooming house, a grocery 
store and a beer bar. Now it's a family-run restaurant serving breakfast, lunch 
and dinner daily. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite Sam's Cafe began as a blacksmith shop and has also been a clothing 
store, restaurant and bar. Collectibles are now sold at Sherlock's Americana 
store, which originally was a general merchandise store and the Knights of 
Pythias meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
A warehouse/general store has become an antique shop, the Ellis Co. It's just 
across the street from an old cigar store and saloon that are gift and 
consignment shops. 
</P>
<P>
Next door is the Kona Trading and Jewelry Co., in a 130-year-old building that 
first served prospectors as a bakery. Antiques and custom-made jewelry are sold 
there today. 
</P>
<P>
One store no longer open is the Sun Sun Wo Co., housed in an adobe building 
that has survived since 1851. It was a major trading place for Coulterville's 
Chinese population, which was estimated at 1,000 during the Gold Rush era. 
</P>
<P>
Hungry visitors can eat at two cafes -- Polly's Bakery and the Jeffery Hotel. 
The hotel dining room opens for breakfast at 6:30 a.m. Lunch is served daily 
from 11 a.m., dinner from 5 p.m. Brunch is offered on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. For reservations, call (209) 878-3473. 
</P>
<P>
A band plays Saturday nights in the Magnolia Saloon, which is open to 2 a.m. on 
weekends. Weekdays, the saloon -- as well as the town -- closes down by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about Coulterville, call the Northern Mariposa County 
Chamber of Commerce at (209) 878-3074 (it's closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays in 
winter) or write to P.O. Box 333, Coulterville, Calif. 95311. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Coulterville from Los Angeles, drive north on Interstate 5 and 
California 99 to Fresno. Exit on California 41 to Oakhurst and pick up the Gold 
Rush route, California 49. 
</P>
<P>
An alternate route is to continue on California 99 to Modesto, then go east on 
California 132 to Coulterville. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Coulterville is 636 miles.

CONSUMER REPORT: TRAVEL RULES SAME FOR EASTERN BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER, Adler is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the dramatic changes taking place in some Eastern European countries, 
their travel regulations still apply in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
For example, take Poland, the first country in Eastern Europe to gain a 
non-communist government. 
</P>
<P>
If you visit Poland by yourself, you have to buy $15 worth of coupons for each 
day of your stay. If you go on a package tour, it isn't necessary, as you've 
probably prepaid for basic services. 
</P>
<P>
Orbis, the state-run travel company, offers some attractively priced packages. 
Competition for Orbis is getting strong, with more 1990 tours being developed 
by other Polish outfits. Many U.S. tour operators are also offering packages 
that include Poland. 
</P>
<P>
And the coupons travelers must buy at $15 per day aren't going to cover 
expenses, and dollars will have to be converted to zlotys, the Polish currency. 
However, there are two exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate during my visit was a little more than 2,000 zlotys 
to the dollar, but the unofficial or premium exchange (which is legal and 
omnipresent) was 7,000 to 8,000 zlotys. 
</P>
<P>
The catch with the unofficial exchange is that zlotys can't be exchanged at 
this rate back into dollars. So don't exchange more dollars than you think 
you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
You can find the premium exchange rate at airports and some hotels. "Be careful 
when exchanging with people on the street, as you can be cheated in any quick 
transaction, especially when you're not familiar with the currency," said 
Waclaw Wojciechowski, a guide. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of exchange is so favorable that you can obtain a sizable amount of 
currency for a relatively small amount of dollars. Moreover, most items are 
inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Travelers should be careful how they express and display the fact that the 
rate of exchange is so favorable to the dollar, as it can create resentment," 
said Wojciechowski. 
</P>
<P>
Take cash, with traveler's checks held in reserve. You'll get the official rate 
of exchange with traveler's checks (which can only be used basically at hotels 
and special hard currency stores such as Pewex) and credit cards. Hold on to 
all receipts. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a great amount of items to buy, and if you find something you like, 
gobble it up. You may not find it again, and the price may be higher the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Many stores, even when specializing in one kind of product, may sell a variety 
of other merchandise. For example, I saw clothing being sold in an art gallery 
and food and souvenirs in a TV emporium. 
</P>
<P>
Although the special Pewex stores, which are found primarily in hotels, only 
accept dollars, you can use zlotys at the Cepelia chain and other stores. 
However, certain items (including crystal, amber and leather merchandise) 
bought with Polish currency may be subject to high taxes before you leave. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised at seeing lines of 20 to 40 people waiting to enter food 
stores. Shortages exist. "Visitors shouldn't expect to find a great deal of 
gourmet food," Wojciechowski said. "There aren't many good restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
One pointer at restaurants: The menus may list dishes that aren't really 
available, and the tip-off to this is when a price isn't listed by an item. 
</P>
<P>
Taxis are inexpensive and have meters, but it's a good idea to have a notion of 
the price. Negotiation may be necessary when getting a cab from a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Look for stickers by the meter indicating how much the base price should be 
multiplied. The sticker on taxis I took indicated that the base price should be 
multiplied by 40 to calculate the full fare. 
</P>
<P>
When walking around cities, be careful, because cars park on sidewalks and 
drivers can make quick turns from the pavement onto streets. Wear comfortable 
walking shoes. 
</P>
<P>
When roaming around the country consider a rail pass that provides unlimited 
travel. The eight-day pass costs $50 first-class and $35 second-class; a 15-day 
version costs $60 first-class and $40 second-class. Payment is in dollars, but 
the pass can be bought in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
However, Orbis representatives counseled travelers to use the express train on 
a point-to-point basis rather than the non-express trains on a pass basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The trains used on the passes are more crowded, not as clean, and you have to 
arrive early to make sure that you get a seat, as there is free seating," 
Wojciechowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Locals also caution against drinking tap water. "It may be polluted," 
Wojciechowski warned. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared, also, for youngsters to spot foreigners and come over with crudely 
scrawled notes asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
While some people speak English, especially at hotels, the services of guides 
while visiting cities and special attractions is worth the relatively small 
expense. One linguistic aid to travelers trying to cope with Polish is to 
pronounce a "w" as a "v." 
</P>
<P>
Two signs of the changing order in Poland can be observed in one corner of 
Warsaw. The Warsaw Marriott (replete with a casino to go with a few others in 
Poland) opened last October. Across one of the streets from the massive complex 
is another example of a free-enterprise system: the Romeo &amp; Juliet Bed and 
Breakfast place. 
</P>
<P>
As part of this transitional period in Poland and other parts of Eastern 
Europe, travelers can expect more candor on how residents describe their 
country and travel-related services. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the misconceptions some travelers have is that we're still a communist 
country and, conversely, that we've become more democratic than we really are." 
</P>
<P>
Poland is served by Pan Am and LOT Polish Airlines from the United States. For 
more information, contact travel agents, or Orbis Polish Travel Bureau, 500 
Fifth Ave., New York 10110, or call toll-free (800) 223-6037), or the Polish 
National Tourist Office, 333 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60601, (312) 
236-9013. 
</P>
<P>
A spot check of other Eastern European countries also undergoing upheavals 
indicated that travel rules for American visitors in 1990 remain the same at 
this point. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to Hungary need a visa. However, there isn't any requirement to 
exchange a certain amount of dollars into forints, the Hungarian currency. 
</P>
<P>
You also can exchange traveler's checks and use major credit cards. When you 
leave Hungary you can convert forints exchanged at the official rate back into 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Two conditions, however, to keep in mind: You can only convert up to 50% of 
this amount up to a total of $100, and you need the original exchange receipt. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Ibusz Hungarian Travel Bureau at One Parker 
Plaza, Ft. Lee, N.J. 07024, (201) 592-8585. There is also a Hungarian Hotels 
Sales Office at 1888 Century Park East, Los Angeles 90067, (213) 448-4321. 
</P>
<P>
A visa is also required for Bulgaria unless you prepay for tourist services, 
such as accommodations and meals, for at least three days. 
</P>
<P>
If you travel independently, you don't need to convert a certain amount of 
dollars into the Bulgarian currency. You can use traveler's checks and major 
credit cards. Contact Balkan Holidays, the U.S. representative for the 
Bulgarian Tourist Office, 161 East 86th St., New York 10028, (212) 722-1110. 
</P>
<P>
No changes have been made in the rules of travel to East Germany, according to 
Pecum Tours, one of the official representatives of that nation's tourist 
office in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
American travelers need to get a visa and to prepay hotel accommodations for 
each night of their stay. Traveler's checks can be exchanged and credit cards 
used at hotels and hotel shops. 
</P>
<P>
You can also go into East Berlin from West Berlin on the same basis as in the 
past. Contact Pecum Tours, 2002 Colfax Ave. South, Minneapolis, Minn. 55405, 
(612) 871-8171. 
</P>
<P>
Cedok, the Czechoslovak tourist office, reported that no changes in travel 
planning have been made. U.S. travelers still need a visa, and, unless they're 
on a package tour, individual visitors need to prepay for vouchers worth $16 a 
day per person. Credit cards can be used and traveler's checks exchanged. 
Contact Cedok, 10 East 40th St., New York 10016, (212) 689-9720.

TETON VILLAGE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our adventure began as soon as my wife and I stepped out of the Rendezvous Inn 
and soared above the village on a 12-minute tram ride to the 10,552-foot summit 
of Rendezvous Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
For the expert skier, black diamond-coded trails such as Alta and the Chutes 
plunge down the 4,139-foot vertical drop, America's longest. 
</P>
<P>
High Mountains Helicopter Skiing takes the experienced mountaineer to be 
dropped off by chopper on three mountain ranges of untracked powder. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole Mountain Guides and Climbing School introduces you to ice and rock 
climbing in the Tetons, and other mountaineering organizations are ready with 
climbing programs and experienced guides. National Park rangers lead snowshoe 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
There's no fee for back-country trip permits, but it is necessary to register 
at Grand Teton National Park Headquarters in Moose before taking off along 
cross-country ski trails into the Teton wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Weather and avalanche hazard forecasts are provided, with cautions that only 
experienced mountaineers with ice axes and other essential equipment should 
attempt climbing steep snow slopes. 
</P>
<P>
At Granite Hot Springs south of Jackson, 10 miles of cross-country skiing lead 
to rest and recovery by soaking amid snowbanks in 104-degree water. A Jack 
London-type adventure is to dog-sled to the hot springs. 
</P>
<P>
Caution and guidance are just as necessary for summer adventuring. The first 
time we stood on the banks of the Snake River in Grand Teton Park, the current 
looked deceptively smooth. But we quickly got the message: Only experienced 
canoeists and kayakers should challenge this swift, cold river. 
</P>
<P>
To preserve its ecology, no motorized craft are permitted on the Snake within 
the park. Only hand-propeled canoes, kayaks and rafts are allowed, and they 
must be registered at the Park's Visitor Center. Ansel Adams made his famous 
painting of the Tetons from the Snake River overlook. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen float trip companies offer white-water rafting and "you-paddle" 
canoeing and rafting adventures on the Snake River, with professional guides to 
prepare the novice or expert for bouncing over the tumbling waters through the 
canyons. Fish from the banks of the river. Sometimes you might even sight a 
moose. 
</P>
<P>
Competitions are scheduled on the ski slopes around Jackson Hole as Wyoming 
begins the celebrations of its 1990 Centennial Year of statehood. Events 
include the Celebrity Ski Challenge (March 8-10), the Junior III Olympics 
(March 13-16), the Super Centennial Alpine Ski Race (March 17-18) and the World 
Championship Snowmobile Hillclimb (March 30-April 1). 
</P>
<P>
Above Teton Village, Jackson Hole Ski Resort has more than 2,500 acres of some 
of the best skiing in the United States on its Sojourner and Apres Vous 
mountains. Fifty percent of the runs are for experts, 40% for intermediates and 
10% for beginners. The longest run is 4.5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aerial tram there are five double chairs, one triple, a quad 
and two surface lifts. Lift rates are $32 daily for adults, $16 for seniors and 
ages under 14, with various reduced package rates. 
</P>
<P>
Alpenhof Lodge, Sojouner Inn and the Inn at Jackson Hole offer luxury resort 
accommodations in the village with dining, pools and spas close to the lifts. 
Double rates start this winter at from $90 to $115, and package rates are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
There are excellent accommodations at lower prices at Crystal Springs Inn and 
the Hostel. The Mangy Moose is popular for dining and entertainment in the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Targhee Ski Resort on the western Teton slopes is about 45 minutes by 
express bus from Jackson, with a combined shuttle and lift ticket cost of $32. 
It has beginnger skiing, but the challenges of the 10,200-foot top elevations 
are primarily for intermediates and experts. 
</P>
<P>
There are three double chairs for the vast slopes, and 1,500 acres accessible 
only by snowcat. Resort lodging is within 50 yards of the lifts, with 
restaurant, pool and hot tubs. Double rates begin at about $55, and there is a 
choice of package deals. Condos are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Snow King Ski Resort is only seven blocks from Town Center in the Old West and 
art town of Jackson, population about 4,500. About 60% of the Snow King slopes 
are adventure challenges for the expert, with about 25%for intermediates and 
15% for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
Two double chairs and one surface lift serve slopes rising to 7,871 feet. Adult 
daily lift rates are $19, juniors and seniors $12, and all fees can be reduced 
with package buys and multi-day rates. 
</P>
<P>
Snow King Resort at the base of the mountain is the valley's largest resort, 
offering 240 rooms, dining, entertainment and spa amenities. Double rates begin 
this winter at $90, and smaller inns around town are as low as $24 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The town can relax you for adventuring at any season of the year. Archways 
created by antlers frame Town Square. The Cowboy Bar has saddle stools, and 
buildings date back to the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Horse-drawn sleigh rides go into the National Elk Refuge at the edge of town, 
where as many as 8,000 elk spend the winter pawing for food. Boy Scouts help 
raise funds for food pellets by collecting and selling antlers shed in the 
spring. Galleries and playhouses of Jackson make it one of the most important 
centers of Western arts. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Hole is a valley that runs south from Yellowstone for about 60 miles 
alongside the Grand Tetons. To fur trapper Davey Jackson in the early 1800s it 
was his "hole" between the towering mountains. Around 1820 lonely and somewhat 
wistful French-Canadian trappers named the three most visible peaks Les Troi 
Tetons, the three breasts. 
</P>
<P>
Congress created the National Elk Refuge in 1912. In 1929, to control ranching 
and development around Jackson Hole, Grand Teton National Park was established. 
John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated 52 square miles of family land holdings to help 
establish the park. 
</P>
<P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: A GOLDEN YEARS PROGRAM NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of San Francisco's Nob Hill hotels has begun a program for mature travelers 
called "Golden Years at San Francisco's Stanford Court." 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the Mark Hopkins and across the street from the Fairmont Hotel, the 
Stanford Court is sited at the only cable car crossing in San Francisco where 
two lines intersect, a further advantage because the regular $2 cable-car fare 
is a mere 15 cents for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
While the prevailing minimum rate at the Stanford Court for a standard room is 
$215 for two persons, the Golden Years rate is $149 for guests who are over the 
age of 60 or members of AARP. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of such rooms is limited, guests will be upgraded to 
superior or deluxe accommodations on a space-available basis. Complimentary 
limousine service is provided daily for shopping, the theater, and to and from 
restaurants or meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The program is available throughout 1990. For reservations or a complimentary 
brochure, write to Golden Years, Stanford Court, Nob Hill, San Francisco 94108, 
or call toll-free (800) HOTELS-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Age Club for mature travelers is a feature of Adriatic Tours. 
Membership is free, and includes a welcome party and orientation tour at each 
resort stop, plus wine tasting and local food specialties, lectures on the 
history and culture of the area, candlelight dinner with wine along with 
special free-time activities such as card games, bingo, ballroom dancing and an 
evening at a casino. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis is on Yugoslavia in the off-season, with many of the tours combined 
with extensions to Athens, Budapest, Istanbul and Rome. Special winter rates 
for mature travelers are in effect from now until April. 
</P>
<P>
Prices quoted for the following tours vary according to departure dates: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two 15-day tours throughout Yugoslavia are priced from $1,295 to $1,398 per 
person. The cost includes round-trip air fare from West Coast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Yugoslav and Italian Connection consists of 15 days which, in addition 
to Zagreb, Opatija and Dubrovnik in Yugoslavia, includes Venice, Florence and 
Rome. Prices range from $1,768 to $1,980 per person. (This tour offers an 
extension to Sorrento for an additional charge.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- An eight-day Russian Troyka extension that includes Moscow, Kalinen and 
Leningrad begins at $1,248 per person, while "Mini Packs" or short trips for 
three or six nights are available from Dubrovnik to Athens, Rome, Budapest or 
Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $398 to $488 for the three-night/four-day add-on, or $520 to 
$650 for six nights/seven days. 
</P>
<P>

Grand Circle Travel has reissued its booklet "Going Abroad: 101 Tips for Mature 
Travelers." It's an excellent guide, even for those experienced in trip 
planning. It has three major sections: preparing for your trip, the trip itself 
and returning home. The book includes tips on currency exchange and the use of 
credit cards for best value, avoiding delays at customs, what to do if you miss 
your connecting flight and steps to take for the safety of your home in your 
absence, plus tips on phoning, sightseeing, tipping and other subjects. For a 
free copy, call (800) 248-3737 or write to Grand Circle Travel, 347 Congress 
St., Boston, Mass. 02210. 
</P>
<P>
Two firms that specialize in mature traveler tours have joined forces to create 
two new "Stay-put" programs in Europe for 1990. University Education Travel and 
Community College Tours offer two itineraries, one of 24 days and the other 28 
days, both of which provide stays of about one week in one place, from which 
travelers fan out for excursions of one or two days. 
</P>
<P>
Both itineraries include Kitzbuhel in Austria's Tirol, France's Loire Valley 
and Lake Geneva in Switzerland. The 24-day tour also includes Lake Maggiore in 
Italy, while the 28-day sojourn adds Montecatini-Terme, Italy, and a four-night 
independent stay in London. 
</P>
<P>
Both tours visit an impressive range of cities, palaces, cathedrals and 
chateaux, with ample free time for shopping and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-departure lectures are given by art history professors who accompany the 
tours. Other features include four-star hotels, daily continental breakfast, 
some lunches and dinners, air-conditioned motor coaches, local guides and a 
professional tour escort. 
</P>
<P>
Prices from Los Angeles, including round-trip air transportation, are $3,595 
for the 28-day tour departing June 28 and $3,395 for the 24-day tour departing 
July 3. For land only, the prices are $2,298 and $2,554. 
</P>
<P>

THE TIMES SHOPPER: EUROPEAN ART FAIR IS FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plan ahead for the annual European Fine Art Fair -- the world's biggest 
exhibition and sale of antique paintings, prints, maps, furniture, objets 
d'art, jewelry, rugs and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will be held March 10-18 at the new Maastricht Exhibition and Congress 
Center. Maastricht, the oldest city in the Netherlands, with cobblestone 
streets and beautiful historic buildings, is in the province of Limburg, near 
the point at which the borders of the Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany 
intersect. 
</P>
<P>
The fair brings together more than 100 of the world's finest art and antique 
dealers from the Netherlands, Great Britain, United States, Austria, Belgium, 
France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This year's roster includes Richard Green (London, paintings), Eskanazi (Milan, 
carpets), Robert Hall (London, snuff bottles), Johnny Van Haeften (London, 
Dutch and Flemish Old Masters), Newhouse Galleries (New York City, paintings), 
Vanderven &amp; Vanderven (Netherlands, oriental porcelains) and Silber-Keller 
(Munich, silver, art nouveau, art deco). Participation is by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people are expected. They include curators from major museums 
plus private collectors, as well as lesser dealers and novices. 
</P>
<P>
Everything on exhibit is for sale. Prices are from several thousand dollars to 
several hundreds of thousands of dollars, but, regardless of the price, each 
piece must be considered "important" to be shown. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the exhibition is carefully scrutinized by a vetting committee. The 
committee not only verifies authenticity, but screens each piece to make sure 
it is rare and in good enough condition to be included at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Items that have been overly restored are not accepted. Nor are pieces of 
furniture that have been "married," i.e., the legs from a table with a damaged 
top have been removed and put on a different table top with damaged legs. 
</P>
<P>
The vetting committee's seal of approval is placed on every item, and copies 
are kept in the fair's office. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are fixed. Many of the tags on items are high, but they are based on 
genuine market value. 
</P>
<P>
Walking into the fair is like entering a museum. Only there is no glass 
encasement between you and the objets d'art. You can actually pick up an 
11th-Century Cambodian bronze statue of the Hindu God Vishnu or a Delftware 
platter made in the 17th Century and examine it at close range. 
</P>
<P>
No one will stop you from running your fingers over a 16th-Century, Flemish, 
wool-and-silk tapestry of an idyllic wooden landscape. You are invited to slip 
the brilliantly glittering diamond and ruby bracelet that once belonged to a 
French queen onto your wrist. You may sit down to rest on a late 16th-Century 
Chinese huang hua-li yokeback armchair. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these items have come from private collections and will go into private 
collections. The fair is the only time that they will be on public display. 
</P>
<P>
The vast interior of the exhibition hall will be transformed into a series of 
small galleries occupied by individual exhibitors. Some of the compartments are 
decorated like opulent rooms, others are more gallery-like. 
</P>
<P>
The diverse range of arts and antiquities will be presented in four sections, 
which makes viewing that much easier. 
</P>
<P>
The Pictura Section covers, from the Old Masters to Impressionists and early 
20th Century. The Contemporary Section includes post-1960 paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The Antiquaires Section offers European and Oriental furniture, bronzes, 
clocks, porcelain and glass, arms and armor, silver and jewelry, books and 
manuscripts. The Textura Section has textiles, carpets and tapestries, both 
European and Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue for the fair will be available only at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
The piece de resistance at last year's fair was a beautiful Charles X French 
rosewood billiard table inlaid with citron wood, sold by Philippe Dufrasne of 
Brussels. Its price was only revealed to prospective buyers, and was not listed 
on the fair's registry of sales. 
</P>
<P>
There were also gem-encrusted reliquaries from the 13th Century, a set of five 
18th-Century Dutch glass paintings depicting members of the House of Orange, 
and a 17th-Century Flemish cabinet of ebony and stained fruitwood covered with 
paintings of landscapes. A set of stag's antlers (German)engraved with "The 
Wise and Foolish Virgins," dated 1563, was once in the William Randolph Hearst 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Items on last year's listing of sales included a Peter Paul Rubens (1557-1638) 
portrait of a bearded man, which sold for $850,000 to a Swedish collector. A 
Paulus Moreelse (1571-1638) painting of Pan playing his pipes sold for about 
$104,000, while a Salomon van Ruysdael (1628-1682) river landscape cost about 
$700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Peabody Museum purchased a 1717 Chinese export plaster figure of an 
unknown gentleman and a rare 18th-Century Chinese blanc de chine group of a 
foreigner riding on a liondog -- both for undisclosed sums. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of 18th-Century Arita porcelain vases and covers cost $14,980, but an 
exquisite Galle vase, dated 1900, decorated with a landscape in blue and yellow 
brought $3,088. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Louis Breguet's extraordinary traveling clock, made in 1817 and still 
ticking, was sold for $54,108. Two ornate golden bracelets set with pink topaz, 
emeralds and diamonds, made in England in 1835, cost $23,000, while a pair of 
fer de Berlin earrings, dated 1840, sold for about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary art that was purchased at the fair last year included an Andy 
Warhol portrait of Marlene Deitrich (1962, gouache and graphite on paper) for 
about $54,108, and "Beuys by Warhol," a silk screen and diamond point done in 
1960 for about $11,723. 
</P>
<P>
A 1972 untitled Willem de Kooning oil on newspaper, mounted on canvas, sold to 
a Swedish collector for about $67,635, and Sam Francis' "Triangle," dated 1975, 
was bought by a Belgian collector for $29,308. 
</P>
<P>
This year the fair will present a series of 12 lectures by specialists. 
Speakers include curators from Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, Boston's Museum of Fine 
Arts and Brussels' Royal Museum of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a program of concerts and recitals, including performances 
by the Moscow Ballet Ensemble, soprano Helen Lawrence and Amsterdam's Kamer 
Orkest. Maastricht's historic buildings are used as venues. 
</P>
<P>
The fair offers a gala first-night viewing and banquet. Tickets are about $50 
U.S., including the catalogue. Fair hours are Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. 
to 6 p.m., Friday from noon to 9 p.m. Admission is about $14, including the 
catalogue.

The reason I am writing to you is to point out a couple of inaccuracies in 
Steve Weinstein's piece, "Uncovering Coba" (Jan. 7). 
</P>
<P>
The article refers to "a pair of lakes." There are actually four lakes in the 
immediate vicinity of the ruins. Another statement: "The pyramid of Nohoch Mul 
towers more than 100 feet above the jungle floor. . . ." The statement is 
correct, but the actual height is about 140 feet.

AS SOVIETS BATTLE ETHNIC BLAZE, IRAN BACKS AWAY FROM FIRE IT FUELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G.H. Jansen, G. H. Jansen, the author of Militant Islam, has covered the 
Middle East for many years.

<P>
While the Soviet Union struggles to control ethnic strife in its republics of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia, Iran to the south faces as great a threat from the 
challenge of nationalist separatism along the Soviet-Iran frontier. The crucial 
factor is that the local peoples involved are on both sides of the border -- as 
disaffected from Tehran as they are from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and Iranian empires are similar. The ruling people inhabit a central 
area, with subordinate peoples of different race or language or religion -- or 
all three -- around the periphery. Ignoring these differences, Farsi-speaking 
Persians of central Iran until recently have been using the Islamic appeal in 
propaganda aimed at the brothers or cousins of its frontier peoples on the 
other side of the border, to subvert their loyalty or destabilize the communist 
system. 
</P>
<P>
On Iran's northern border, these transfrontier peoples are the Azerbaijanis -- 
or Azeris, as they are usually called, plus the Turkomen and Uzbeks; on the 
southern and western periphery are the Baluchis, Arabs and Kurds. Except for 
the Azeris, who have Shiism in common, (though as many as 30% are Sunni 
Muslims), all these peoples differ from Persians in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
Whether from land hunger or because of family and communal links, the Soviet 
Azeris have been tearing up frontier fences in the last few weeks. Their 
original demand was for easier access to relatives and to Shiite shrines across 
the Araks River; this then hardened into a demand for permanent opening of the 
frontier. In short, they wanted the sort of arrangement that has been 
implemented between the two Germanys. But then an extremist Azeri group, 
National Salvation, asked for a separatist state of Iranian and Soviet 
Azerbaijanis, to include the border enclave of Nakhichevan. Their demand 
stressed the Islamic link, and some publications in Tehran also spoke of this 
urge for "Islamic unity" as a triumph for Iran's pan-Islamic propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
These few references apart, official reaction of the mullahs' regime in Tehran 
to the Azeri actions has been decidedly ambiguous. After an initial period of 
puzzled silence, the Iranians called upon the Soviets to keep their Azeri 
citizens under control. Then when the Soviet Azeris assembled on a northern 
bank of the Araks, the Iranians, using loudspeakers from the other bank, 
advised them to contact their local authorities so that visits could be 
properly arranged. There was no exploitation of the Islamic brotherhood theme 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranians went further, commending the restraint of Soviet frontier guards 
who had helped "in checking the overexcitement of the Muslim Soviet 
Azerbaijanis." One skeptical Iranian official even described Azeri agitation as 
the triumph of nationalism over reason. After emergency talks in Moscow, both 
sides have presented the frontier situation as a simple problem in tourism that 
called for an administrative solution. 
</P>
<P>
Why, after a decade of excited, subversive propaganda, have the mullahs adopted 
this low-key, even discouraging, attitude just when the propaganda seemed to be 
producing results? One factor is that the sub-religion of nationalism is 
anathema to propagators of a universalist faith like Islam (or communism). And 
nationalism leading to a local separatist movement is not only wicked but 
dangerous, especially for Iran with its numerous restive frontier peoples. 
Hence, while the use or teaching of the Azeri language (a simple form of 
Turkish) has not been banned in Iran as has Kurdish, its use has been 
discouraged by Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, ever since the so-called Islamic revolution, Tehran has felt the 
need to keep a particularly suspicious and watchful eye on the Azerbaijan 
region. Azeris, led by Ayatollah Kazem Shariat-Madari, played a part in 
overthrowing the shah, but soon afterward rejected Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's key doctrine of velayat-e-faqih, the semi-divine right of the 
clerical caste to rule. Eventually Shariat-Madari was stripped of his clerical 
role, accused of treason and placed under house arrest for life. This 
humiliation offended the Azeris, who still revere their ayatollah; force has 
had to be used to suppress Azeri dissidence. The mullahs certainly do not want 
to see any swelling of the numbers of troublesome Azeris, who have been talking 
of an Azeri nation-state separate from both the Soviet Union and the Islamic 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has confirmed that the dissidents in 
Azerbaijan are striving for an independent Islamic republic that would unify 
Soviet and Iranian Azeris. This would be the last thing the Tehran regime would 
want -- a separate source of Islamic power, differing from the Iranian Islamic 
Republic in race, language and political and social structures. It would also 
set a precedent for other possible independent Islamic republics, unifying 
Sunni Muslim Turkomen or Uzbeks or Kurds straddling Iran's borders. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger to Iran is that if ever the Azeris achieved that state, then 
the dominoes would begin to tumble all round the rim of the Persian 
metropolitan homeland, and Iran could lose up to half of its current territory 
and population. Because Iran and the Soviet Union face the same secessionist 
danger, they have come to see the Azeri-Persian issue eye-to-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Closer contacts with Soviet Azeris would lead Iranian Azeris to making 
comparisons, dangerous to Tehran, between the economic, cultural and social 
development of the two groups. The northern area of Soviet Azerbaijan is 
industrialized and urbanized because of the oil industry around Baku. Even the 
less-developed area of Nakhichevan on the border is far ahead of Iranian 
Azerbaijan, a typically neglected backward part of a Third World country. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Azerbaijan is also culturally advanced, with several centers of higher 
learning and a well-developed publishing industry. After 70 years of secular 
communist rule, the attitudes and style of the Soviet Azeris are much different 
from their Iranian cousins, particularly because of the Islamic republic. The 
northerners would find it very difficult to accept the rule of the mullahs, as 
would Soviet Azeri women the wearing of the black chador. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of trans-frontier and cross-cultural integration were brutally 
revealed when many members of the Turkish minority fled pell-mell from Bulgaria 
into Turkey. When their number reached 300,000, Turkey had to close its 
frontier and introduce visas. The immigrants were soon disillusioned because of 
Turkey's relative backwardness and a lack of suitable employment -- 100,000 
have already returned to Bulgaria and more are on their way. Azeri or Turkoman 
unification would produce the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Iran's Islamic pull might be unable to compete with the counter-pull 
of a better way of life in the ethnically linked areas across the Soviet 
frontier, especially if those areas became autonomous or even independent. If 
chunks of the Soviet empire drop away, that, by itself, could cause fissuring 
and falling away of parts of Iran's empire as well.

<P>
To become known as an expert on perestroika -- or to discuss it intelligently 
at cocktail parties -- you must begin by picking a date, any date, for Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's fall. Resist logic. 
</P>
<P>
A prediction is especially effective when delivered in a nonchalant but certain 
tone: "He won't last through the year." Avoid exact dates, such as Nov. 7 or 
the 18th of Brumaire. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the fall of Gorbachev within six months is unsatisfying. The public 
should be forced to wait. The Gorbachev fall within three years is unsatisfying 
as well. Americans don't plan that far in the future. 
</P>
<P>
If Gorbachev fails to fall after your deadline, advance the projection without 
losing pomp: "I have underestimated the lethargy factor inherent in the Russian 
soul and the Soviet society." 
</P>
<P>
Stress that more than anything the Western World needs a comprehensive strategy 
in dealing with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
When offering such a strategy, employ cascades of run-on sentences placing 
verbs in uncustomary positions, a la German, employing a large number of 
manufactured terms such as "Sovietism." 
</P>
<P>
Study the publishing field like a professor hunting tenure. To attain the best 
results, find a reputable scholarly journal willing to accept gibberish under a 
pseudonym. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing a pseudonym, opt for any letter that comes late in any alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
The pseudonym "Z" was recently taken by an author in Daedalus, journal of the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Z was a clever tactical choice, avoiding Y (which could be interpreted as a 
question) and forcing other authorities to look for other pseudonyms in their 
alphabet soup. X had been used years earlier by George F. Kennan, a true 
visionary, who explained the Cold War under covert identity. 
</P>
<P>
Given the interest generated by the Z piece in the U.S. media, your analysis 
will bring new hordes of reporters scavenging outside the homes of the usual 
suspects -- Henry A. Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. The more enterprising 
journalists will rummage through the garbage of these wise and good men, 
searching the compost of yesterday's dinners for discarded rough drafts. 
</P>
<P>
While the search continues, sit still. Wait for your historic moment. As soon 
as reporters cease to root in Glad bags, come forward and say proudly "I was 
'Zed,' " (you brightly opted to become the continental Z), leading to talk 
radio, perhaps even MacNeil-Lehrer and surely boosting the size of future book 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
Don't admit worry about being right. Events in the Soviet Union outpace public 
memory. Any proposal becomes obsolete -- therefore unassailable -- almost 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Your broadcast efforts need not acknowledge complexity, the existence of 286 
million (if you still count Lithuania) people who make up Soviet society. 
Reduce discussion to three topics: Gorbachev, the Communist Party and the 
Soviet economy. Then proceed without doubt: "Gorbachev won't last a year, the 
Communist Party won't surrender monopoly of power without a fight and the 
Soviet economy is a mess." You may make references to the Soviet 
"intellectuals" as a small group that wants democracy and therefore makes up 
Gorbachev's power base. Do not be deterred by any election results in asserting 
that only intellectuals want democracy while everyone else wants food. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist groups such as Pamyat are good targets of opportunity. When 
discussing this loosely knit right-wing association, feel free to picture a 
powerful hate group uniting millions of people intent on reviving the days of 
the pogroms. Or, by contrast, describe Pamyat as nothing but a small band on 
the lunatic fringe. Audiences like conflicting reports. 
</P>
<P>
But they do not like complexity, so avoid the problem of nationalities. Just 
call that whole collection of disparate peoples a "challenge to the Kremlin" 
and let the Uzbeks distinguish themselves from the Kazakhs and the Tadzhiks. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts of conversations with Moscow taxi drivers are indispensable. Drivers 
in Moscow, like Moscow intellectuals who have become cab drivers in New York, 
will tell you without hesitation that Gorbachev cannot last another year. 
</P>
<P>
U, too, can be a seer.

CALIFORNIA: 80 YEARS AGO, STATE GOVERNMENT FREED ITSELF FROM RAILROAD ROBBER 
BARONS; TODAY A NEW KIND OF POLITICAL CLOUT PARALYZES LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year marks the 80th anniversary of California's political revolution -- 
the election of reformer Hiram Johnson as governor and the immediate end of an 
era when railroad robber barons ruled the state with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and the Republican Progressives led a citizens' rebellion to halt 
corruption that ran rampant through the instruments of state government. As a 
result of their reforms, Californians got the tools of direct democracy -- the 
initiative, referendum and recall, along with weakened political parties. For 
many years thereafter, California's system of government was held up as a model 
for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But now, in the century's final decade, the California political system again 
stands in a state of gross disrepair and disrepute. Historians claim the 1980s 
produced more political scandals and less public benefit than any decade since 
the end of railroad rule. 
</P>
<P>
Could a latter-day Hiram Johnson lead the state out of the morass of political 
corruption, legislative paralysis, initiative excess, voter manipulation and 
citizen cynicism? Anyone attempting such a feat would find the challenge 
monumental, compared with the successful campaign of Johnson's 
Lincoln-Roosevelt League. The current evils, the product of an evolutionary 
process, are much more complex and without an easily identifiable villain. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of the same medicines employed by Johnson to cure the ailments of his 
time are being blamed for the political diseases of today. Many California 
political scientists claim the state would be far better off in 1990 with 
stronger political parties and less direct democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Considering how much the state has changed in 80 years, Johnson's reforms have 
had remarkable staying power. California government avoided a systemic 
breakdown for roughly 70 years, although the image of the Golden State was 
periodically tarnished by occasional scandals and political outrages. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's model system started to fail in 1966, when two politically 
momentous events caused a radical change in Sacramento -- the passage of a 
proposition creating a full-time Legislature and the first election under the 
U.S. Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote decision. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmaking became a full-time profession with significantly higher pay and 
excellent fringe benefits. Lobbyists by the hundreds became full-time residents 
of Sacramento. Associations and professional organizations moved their 
headquarters to the capital. Grass-roots political campaigning became almost 
extinct, and elected officials sought more and more money to pay for expensive 
media campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The next shoe dropped in 1978, when California voters launched the tax revolt 
by approving Proposition 13, sponsored by Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann. 
Proposition 13 launched a new era; major public-policy decisions were made 
through the all-or-nothing initiative process, instead of the give-and-take of 
representative government. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 demonstrated the potency of direct democracy to a new generation 
of Californians, and a record number of initiatives were placed on the ballot 
during the '80s. No longer is the initiative a safety valve of the citizenry, 
as envisioned by Johnson, but rather an economic tool of interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Upon election as governor in 1910, Johnson inherited a government essentially 
owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The governor elected in 1990 will be 
forced to deal with a Legislature in which the interests of lawmakers and 
lobbying organizations are also intertwined -- in a far different way. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, deciding that their careers depend on the constant flow of 
contributions from numerous sources into their campaign coffers, are afraid to 
offend any benefactor. The result is often an inability to reach decisions. 
Legislators try to act as referees in bouts between contributors representing 
rival groups, and problems continue to fester when agreements cannot be 
hammered out. James R. Mills, a San Diego historian who once served as 
president pro tem of the state Senate, says the Legislature now acts as though 
"there are no problems but political problems." 
</P>
<P>
This massive linkage of public weal and private wealth has produced the current 
tide of scandal in California. Eugene C. Lee, a UC Berkeley political 
scientist, says he cannot think of any time in modern history when so many 
high-ranking California public officials faced charges of corruption. "And I 
can't remember a time in which the role of money and campaign finance seems so 
dominant," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Political spending escalated at the start of the 1980s, when internecine 
warfare erupted within the Democratic Party over the Speakership of the 
Assembly, and no effort was spared in extracting funds from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
The current Speaker, Willie Brown, has elevated the art of political 
fund-raising to new heights. Elected officials like Brown are the power brokers 
of today, just as the unelected railroad barons called the shots in 1910. There 
was a prime example of Brown's clout last week, when he was credited with 
killing the only active legislation to provide low-cost automobile insurance to 
California's poor. While the bill had support from Democrats and Republicans, 
consumer groups and several insurance companies, it was opposed by trial 
lawyers, who stood to lose income from a reduction in auto-accident claims. The 
trial lawyers have been heavy donors to Brown's campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the two-party system is supposed to provide the public a way to 
change such a dysfunctional system. But, compared with most states, political 
parties are almost irrelevant in California. "We have 121 political parties in 
California, 120 legislators raising their own money in their own way, and the 
governor does his thing too. The result is chaos," said political scientist 
Randy H. Hamilton of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Hiram Johnson weakened the parties because he saw them as tools used by the 
powerful against the people. But now, in an era of mass media hard-sell, it is 
difficult for voters to assess candidates. Legislative districts are drawn to 
maximize incumbent protection and citizens turn away from the ballot box in 
ever-increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
With problems unresolved in Sacramento, a variety of interests -- 
environmentalists and consumerists as well as doctors, lawyers and insurance 
chiefs -- turn to Johnson's "direct democracy" to promote economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
But the public is being victimized by "bait-and-switch" initiatives with highly 
visible provisions that appeal to voters; buried in the small print are the 
provisions designed to enrich the sponsors, according to UC's Lee. 
</P>
<P>
While the initiative process retains sacrosanct status with the public, voters 
have tried to cure perceived ills through limitations on lobbyist activities 
and campaign contributions. But these measures have largely been ineffective, 
often producing more confusion than reform. 
</P>
<P>
So-called reform proposals again are headed for the ballot this year, among 
them measures that would limit the terms of lawmakers. But there is no quick 
fix on the horizon, as there was in 1910. "At least in those days, you knew who 
to blame," said historian James Rawls of Pleasant Hill. "Now there is a 
Hydra-headed monster, instead of the Southern Pacific."

DRUG WAR: WRONG FORCES, WRONG FRONT 
</P>

Patterson Fellow.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a matter of weeks, the United States switched from fighting the Cold War to 
fighting the drug war. The invasion of Panama ushered in the new era; we will 
pay any price, bear any burden, to combat the drug menace. A Marine patrol has 
already fired on suspected traffickers crossing the Mexican border and the 
Pentagon drafted plans (now on hold) to mount a naval blockade off the coast of 
Colombia. President Bush, who will attend a summit with Andean leaders next 
month in Cartegena, plans to spend $2 billion over the next five years to fight 
drugs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is likely to make much difference. Overseas, the war on drugs, 
despite last week's reported surrender by a Colombian cartel, is shaping up as 
a loser. To understand why, we must examine the nature of the U.S. buildup in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The war is led by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics 
Matters. The bureau controls an interregional air wing of more than 50 
aircraft, including fixed-wing, C-123 cargo transports and Vietnam-era 
helicopters. The aircraft are used to ferry troops, move supplies and, most 
important, spray crops. Today, the State Department unit is dousing coca, 
marijuana and poppy fields in Colombia, Guatemala, Belize, Jamaica and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
While the bureau controls the skies, the Drug Enforcement Administration runs 
the ground show. Traditionally assigned to the domestic drug trade, DEA is 
strengthening its presence in Latin America. Today, more than 150 agents work 
in 17 countries. Agency personnel are also more and more involved in 
paramilitary actions in the coca-rich regions of South America, where, armed 
with machine guns and jungle knives, they stage helicopter raids on processing 
labs and clandestine airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Intelligence Agency also expands its presence in Latin America, 
with new agents assigned to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and elsewhere. At CIA 
headquarters in Langley, Va., a Counter-Narcotics Center collates the steady 
stream of data coming in from agents, informants, wiretaps, radar and 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Pentagon. Even as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announces major cuts 
in defense spending, the U.S. Southern Command in Panama is preparing to step 
up activities throughout Latin America. Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the commander, 
has already made several trips to Andean nations, canvassing the needs of local 
military and police chiefs. Arms shipments grow. In 1988, Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia received a total of $3 million in military aid; this year the total 
will be $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even agencies with little history of involvement in Latin America are 
enlisting. The U.S. Customs Service has dispatched agents across the continent 
to assist local forces in sealing borders, controlling highways and training 
dogs to sniff parcels at airports. The Coast Guard has sent mobile training 
teams to instruct local policemen in river interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is on full drug-war footing. But its warriors are likely to slip 
when engaging the enemy, their generals committing the same errors as 
predecessors who fought the war against communism in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's the friendly dictator syndrome. Just as Washington frequently 
cozied up to despots like Anastasio Somoza and Francois Duvalier because of 
their opposition to communism, it now embraces similar characters whose only 
redeeming quality is strong opposition to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Take Haiti. Gen. Prosper Avril became president in a 1988 military coup; he has 
repeatedly reneged on promises to hold free elections and respect human rights. 
But he has moved aggressively against cocaine traffickers. "The (Avril) 
government . . . has expressed a firm commitment to cutting the flow of illegal 
drugs through Haiti," the State Department said in its 1989 International 
Narcotics Control Strategy Report. "Despite political turmoil, the Haitians 
have maintained drug interdiction efforts and cooperated closely with U.S. 
authorities." "Political turmoil" included disappearances, killings and popular 
clamorings for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
After Panama, such chumminess is dismaying. For years, Washington overlooked 
Manuel A. Noriega's involvement in drugs because of his usefulness in fighting 
communism. The lesson seems lost; the United States woos other Noriega-like 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's emerging weakness for anti-drug strongmen highlights a broader 
flaw in drug policy -- a predilection for military solutions to problems that 
are primarily social and economic in origin. With unemployment soaring, prices 
skyrocketing and governments paralyzed by external debt and corruption, 
destitute peasants have turned to coca as a dependable means of income. Only 
economic development and crop-substitution programs offer a realistic chance of 
getting these farmers off coca. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has displayed little interest in the economic roots 
of the cocaine problem. U.S. agents spend far more time with generals and 
police chiefs than with agrarian planners and peasant representatives. Just as 
10 years of military intervention in Central America failed to bring peace to 
the region, current reliance on interdiction and law enforcement is unlikely to 
stem the flow of cocaine into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's reputed offer by the "Extraditables," a group believed to speak for 
the Medellin cartel -- to end the violence and get out of the narcotics trade 
in exchange for amnesty -- doesn't mean Colombia has won its war against the 
drug lords. President Bush and Colombian President Virgilio Barco are rightly 
skeptical of the feeler. But as recent polls in Colombia show, the people would 
favor exploring such a deal. Any arrangement that might end the bloodshed 
should not be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
But an agreement between the Colombian government and the cartel does not 
guarantee diminished exports of cocaine to the United States. For every 
Medellin drug lord thinking about retirement, there are dozens of traffickers 
waiting to take his place. The Cali drug cartel also does business in Colombia; 
it may expand, having been spared by the government offensive. As long as 
Americans demand cocaine, South Americans will supply it. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America's cocaine industry now extends over an area nearly as large as 
the continental United States. It employs millions of people, generates tens of 
billions of dollars. The narcos have huge stockpiles of sophisticated arms and 
maintain private armies that, in some cases, dwarf those of the established 
security forces. Add weak governments that barely control their national 
territories and it's enough to make one nostalgic for the Cold War.

No other country this century has suffered more wars than Israel. During the 
past four decades, that tiny nation of 4.5 million people living in a space of 
8,000 square miles has fought five bloody conflicts with neighboring hostile 
Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Today, of the 21 Arab countries, only Egypt recognizes Israel's right to exist. 
Still, Israel knows it must find a lasting peace, and in the face of hostile 
powers continues to seek a negotiated resolution to regional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Israel proposed a comprehensive four-point plan that offers 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip the opportunity to participate in 
free and democratic elections to select representatives to negotiate a possible 
end to military occupation and the establishment of self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, if an interim period of stability and joint cooperation on 
local governmental policies succeeds, the representatives would then take the 
next step of negotiating final status of the territories. 
</P>
<P>
This plan originated with the Camp David accords, jointly developed and signed 
by the United States, Egypt and Israel. After its presentation by Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, it was warmly embraced by President Bush and Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
While some Palestinian leaders in the territories reportedly wish to respond 
positively to the Shamir plan, Yasser Arafat and his Tunisia-based Palestine 
Liberation Organization have supported a campaign of terror and intimidation 
designed to block any progress. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, between 200 and 300 Palestinians have died at the hands of their 
fellow Arabs, according to Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO opposes free elections precisely because it does not want to surrender 
its power and influence to elected representatives, who, as a result of their 
residency in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, have a direct, personal stake in 
reaching a settlement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has prudently agreed to discuss substantive issues with those who are 
most directly involved -- the democratically chosen representatives of the 
territorial residents. But with equal prudence, Jerusalem has persevered in 
refusing to allow terrorists masquerading as diplomats to sit at the conference 
table. 
</P>
<P>
In one breath, Arafat proclaimed an end to terrorism against Israel by the PLO, 
then announced that anyone daring to seek a peaceful resolution of the intifada 
could expect "10 bullets in the chest." 
</P>
<P>
Since Arafat's supposed renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's 
right to exist, the PLO has continually supported terrorist action against 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who believe we can trust the PLO to govern the West Bank should heed the 
lesson of Lebanon. In September, 1970, when King Hussein expelled the PLO from 
Jordan to prevent his own intifada, this infamous terrorist group moved into 
southern Lebanon. They brought hatred and divisions that fueled a 14-year civil 
war while they used the country as a base and safe haven from which to project 
terrorism against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The peace process recently took a major leap forward when the governments of 
Israel and Egypt agreed -- with conditions -- to Baker's five-point plan to 
begin discussions leading to elections as envisioned by Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's acceptance is rightly based on the understanding that it will not deal 
with the PLO and that substantive issues will be negotiated only with elected 
Palestinian representatives. Egypt's acceptance in principle of the Baker plan 
reinforces Israel's position that negotiations must be limited to the authentic 
civilian leadership of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which further isolates the 
terrorist elements of the PLO from the search for a diplomatic resolution. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S., Israeli and Egyptian officials are expected to meet in 
Washington for discussions on the agenda for initial negotiations between 
Jerusalem and Palestinian representatives of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible Palestinians now have an opportunity to show that they can act in 
good faith and seriously discuss conditions needed to secure enduring peace. If 
not, we can expect them to continue the public relations effort that Arafat 
launched in 1988, aimed at creating American impatience with the Shamir 
government's rightful insistence upon protections required for Israel's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than expressing dismay with the Israeli government, Americans should 
condemn the ongoing duplicity of the PLO. Our sympathy and encouragement should 
be reserved for those Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza who have 
the great courage to brave PLO threats and work for an accord within the 
framework of the Israeli initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, above all, ought to be not just patient but unequivocally in support 
of the position of America's strategic ally, Israel, that it cannot -- and 
should not be expected to -- negotiate with those whose ultimate aim is its 
annihilation.

I applaud your editorial because the flies are far more acceptable than 
constant, perpetual malathion spraying. The pesticide lobby claims that farmers 
will be forced to leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, let them leave. California has many profitable industries which do not 
require that the population be doused with pesticides on a continuing basis. 
Concerns over health should override concerns for profit. 
</P>
<P>
To all those who sit in their living rooms smugly content with the knowledge 
that they are not in a spraying area, take another look into the night sky. 
Every time they spray in our area, the helicopters are flying higher. This does 
cut down on the noise and terror factor, but it also ensures that gentle 
breezes are wafting the poison over a much greater area. So look for the 
telltale brown spots.

Referring to the editorial "California Here They Come" and counting (Dec. 11), 
what gives me concern is that even now there are more registered motor vehicles 
in California than there are people in Alaska, Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, 
Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming and Montana 
combined. There are 21.3 million autos in California and 19.5 million people in 
those 12 states according to the 1990 World Almanac. 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope that when those who are coming, do come, that they arrive by train 
or jet and when they get here they will make use of taxis or public 
transportation.

STATE BUDGET PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian's proposed budget is a slap in the face to all those who spend 
hours waiting at welfare offices every month to get a grant that puts them well 
below the poverty line. The governor plans not only to freeze the AFDC (or 
welfare) grant at an already unlivable level, but also to slash by 20% funding 
for the Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it was designed to offer educational and job training opportunities 
to welfare recipients to help them out of the cycle of poverty, the GAIN 
program in Los Angeles has only 49 job training slots to offer the 
approximately 3,700 participants. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's cuts -- to welfare, health care, and services to the elderly -- 
take aim at those of all ages who struggle with poverty. All this so that he 
can set aside $1.2 billion for a "rainy day." The Los Angeles County health 
system is attempting to deal with twice as many patients as it can care for 
responsibly. The welfare offices are so understaffed that it often takes a 
pregnant mother over three months to get the Medi-Cal she needs to receive 
prenatal care. And this isn't rain?

THESE DIET STORIES ARE KILLING US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sure is tough being an American food consumer these days. We may be in 
greater danger of information overload than overeating. Today's in-demand 
miracle food is tomorrow's discount sale item. What next? 
</P>
<P>
Well, now some experts are trying to tell us that there's "nothing special" 
about oat bran. We think that it's pretty special to have five boxes of the 
stuff in the kitchen cupboard. But now the respected New England Journal of 
Medicine is out with a new study that challenges whether oat bran has any more 
specific value in lowering cholesterol than other fibers, like wheat. 
</P>
<P>
But don't throw out your oat bran yet. Skeptics of this study say we need to be 
sure the new conclusions about oats would apply to those with high blood 
cholesterol. So we need even more cholesterol studies. 
</P>
<P>
They may not prove as helpful to our health as to the wealth of dietetics 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of cholesterol, the study was talking about bad, not good, 
cholesterol. That's right, after years of hearing about cholesterol only in a 
bad context, the public now knows that there is the good kind, called serum HDL 
cholesterol. The code name for high density lipoprotein, HDL is supposed to 
significantly improve cardiovascular health. And guess what can boost the level 
of HDL in the bloodstream? Eight ounces of wine a day, according to several 
medical studies. Yes, too much alcohol is bad, but if you are otherwise healthy 
and not pregnant, a little each day is supposed to be beneficial with a meal. 
Or so some tell us. 
</P>
<P>
And given today's health consciousness, that meal is more likely to include 
fish, right? That's fine, except that since the government doesn't require 
inspection of seafood, some worry that a diet full of fish could include some 
chemicals and bacteria we didn't count on. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, well. There is a strong temptation to return to the simple admonitions of 
childhood to eat from the basic food groups (remember the long chart that used 
to hang in the school nurse's office?) and take everything else with a grain of 
salt. 
</P>
<P>
But we obviously can't do that until we see the next major medical study on 
salt.

I wonder if your readers in Medfly quarantine areas are aware of the state's 
proposed spraying schedule for malathion. After receiving our notice that "your 
area is being put on an approximate 21-day treatment schedule beginning with 
this treatment," I called the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The "21-day treatment schedule" means that we are to be re-sprayed every 21 
days until March. Then we are to be re-sprayed every 14 days until June. After 
that we are to be re-sprayed every 7 days until full eradication. And that 
eradication is doubtful according to some of the scientists who helped develop 
the original program (Part A, Jan. 11). 
</P>
<P>
All this is to be done just so we can export our fruit to Japan without 
treating it.

I have eradicated the Medflies from my navel orange tree in my back yard simply 
by using a fly swatter. A Medfly first appeared on my orange tree about three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Department of Agriculture about them. They said they had traps in 
my area. 
</P>
<P>
I then discovered that the Medfly is not as quick as a housefly. You could 
practically place your hand over the orange before they would fly away. 
</P>
<P>
So each day I would go out and swat the flies. I must have killed about 50 to 
100 or more and finally I got the last one. This took about two weeks. No more 
Medflies have appeared in the last three weeks.

A SHOCK TREATMENT THAT MAKES NO SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN M. YODER JR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Moynihan proposal is the headiest political intoxicant Democrats have 
sniffed in years. Their delight in it may yet overwhelm all sorts of 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan tax cuts, combined with indexing and the defense buildup, 
approximately tripled the national debt, and no end of deficit spending is yet 
in sight. The Republicans, despite the worries among their wiser heads, have 
treated this fiscal insanity as a political opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Now insult has been added to injury, as the smarting Democrats see it, by the 
1983 Social Security bailout. That bipartisan accord was designed to provide 
for the eventual retirement, in massive numbers, of the baby-boom generation. 
But pending that 21st-Century need, the scheduled payroll tax increases are 
generating huge surpluses in the Social Security trust accounts. Those 
surpluses provide fiscal padding for the GOP fiscal scam. They offer a 
deceptive mask for the still-deepening operating deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, as budget-literate Democrats know, is risky in all sorts of ways, 
beginning with the near certainty that in a congressional election year, cuts 
in Social Security taxes will not be balanced by other, more progressive tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Moynihan's maneuver is a brilliant political stroke, the first 
really shrewd Democratic response in eight long, frustrating years of being 
beaten to death by Republican tax-cut sloganeering.

NOW HERE'S A REAL WHITE-HAT ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY PLANNING: DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE VOTED TO RESTORE CLINIC 
BUDGETS. GOV. DEUKMEJIAN SHOULD RESTRAIN HIS VETO PEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY B. FRIEDMAN, Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) chairs the Assembly 
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even partisan legislators will admit that there are two sides to most 
controversial issues, with more shades of gray than of black and white. An 
exception, however, is the funding of California's family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Both houses of the state Legislature voted overwhelmingly last week to restore 
clinic funding that had been slashed by Gov. Deukmejian. Those cuts, reducing 
state funding from $36 million to just $12 million, forced 13 clinics in Los 
Angeles and 37 others throughout the state to close. Tens of thousands of needy 
women were left unserved. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the broad support among both Democrats and Republicans in the Assembly 
for restoration of the funding, Deukmejian may still veto the measure: His 
public statements have been far from reassuring. There are good reasons for 
both liberals and conservatives to override such a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals support family planning because, in addition to birth-control 
services, the clinics provide vital health care to low-income women. In 
California, one-fifth of our population has no health insurance. Uninsured 
working people often have no better access to health care than those who depend 
on MediCal, which itself serves far fewer people than the number who need help. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, poor and uninsured women go to family planning clinics for 
services otherwise unavailable to them, such as comprehensive examinations that 
can detect cervical and breast cancer, diabetes and sexually transmitted 
diseases. At a legislative hearing last November, Dr. Marcus Conant, co-chair 
of the Governor's Leadership Task Force on AIDS, testified that the clinics 
also provide life-saving AIDS testing and counseling to high-risk sexually 
active young women. He predicted an increased incidence of AIDS unless the 
clinics' funding is restored. 
</P>
<P>
There are good fiscal, social and political reasons for conservatives, 
including Deukmejian, to support family planning, too. A recent study by UC San 
Francisco established that the state saves $12.20 for every $1.00 it spends on 
family planning. Because of the funding cuts, the same study estimates that 
more than 57,000 additional unwanted pregnancies will occur this year, 
resulting in $190 million in avoidable MediCal and other social services costs. 
Family planning is therefore one of the most cost-effective state programs. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side of the abortion debate gains from family planning cuts, since no 
state Office of Family Planning funds may be used to perform abortions. Indeed, 
the goal of abortion opponents is actually furthered by the program. Simply 
stated, you don't need an abortion if you're not pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Through their counseling services and the birth-control devices they offer, 
family planning clinics help women, especially teen-age girls, avoid pregnancy. 
History and common sense convincingly prove that whether or not women have the 
legal right to choose abortion they will risk their lives to have illegal 
abortions. Therefore, the rational anti-abortionist has no reason to oppose 
family planning. 
</P>
<P>
It is also good politics to support family planning. There is no visible public 
constituency urging closure of the clinics. Quite the contrary, they enjoy 
broad, bipartisan support. Many anti-abortion Republicans now face serious 
political challenge, demonstrated most recently by Democratic State Sen. Lucy 
Killea's upset victory in a conservative San Diego district. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, many anti-abortion legislators will not alter their positions 
on an issue fraught with such deep religious and moral overtones. For such 
politicians, support for family planning offers an intellectually consistent 
way to demonstrate concern for women's reproductive health to pro-choice 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
Family planning ought to be a motherhood and apple pie issue. It saves lives 
and money, reduces abortions and is good politics. Despite this, for no 
apparent rational reason, Deukmejian last week suggested that the clinics 
should provide only information about birth control -- no services, no health 
care -- and therefore $12 million is sufficient. In fact, his 1990-91 budget 
would maintain the cut for another year. 
</P>
<P>
But why go to the mat with a veto? Saving family planning would be a good way 
for the Legislature and the governor to start off the new year harmoniously. 
And by signing the funding restoration bill now, Deukmejian would avoid a nasty 
and politically risky fight.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Patrick Moynihan set Washington's monuments whirling by suggesting that 
people may stop reading President Bush's lips and start reading their pay stubs 
when they see that a whopping payroll tax increase has made this month's check 
much smaller than last month's. 
</P>
<P>
The funds are ostensibly being withheld for Social Security -- but in fact, 
they're just being used to pay for assorted federal expenditures, and the huge 
trust fund surpluses are being used to distort the true size of the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit targets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a word for this," Moynihan said. "The word is thievery." 
</P>
<P>
First, the White House scoffed at the idea of a Democrat being for any tax cut. 
But then it was endorsed by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has 
become a retirement home for former Reagan Administration ideologues. And soon 
Republican congressional leaders were warning Bush aides that Moynihan might 
have sparked a Grand Old Party stampede. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Bush team is complaining that Moynihan is just trying to make the 
Administration look bad in an election year by pushing a Populist tax cut when 
they're pushing their capital gains tax cut -- all of which will make the 
deficit look so much higher than it does now. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to say it is that it's time for the Administration to stop 
deceiving the public.

MIKE DOWNEY: AN INITIAL REACTION TO N.O.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beware of people with the initials J. M. 
</P>
<P>
You never know what they might end up doing in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The late John Matuszak tore up the town the week before Super Bowl XV. Out 
until 3 a.m., dancing with other men's wives, making a spectacle of himself, 
making Philadelphia's coach more upset than his own, the Tooz went out a few 
days later and helped the Raiders win easily, 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
Next time the Supergame came to the Superdome, it was Jim McMahon's turn. He 
brought in an acupuncturist. He showed a helicopter pilot his best side. And 
then the Chicago Bear quarterback played his moon off in Super Bowl XX, 
sticking a pin in the New England Patriots, 46-10. 
</P>
<P>
So, the question becomes: 
</P>
<P>
What will Joe Montana do? 
</P>
<P>
Well, knowing this J. M. the way we do, we'd be surprised if he did anything 
more outrageous before Super Bowl XXIV than go over to Pascal Manale's and 
drool barbecued shrimp juice. 
</P>
<P>
Montana isn't exactly the life of the party. Oh, he's inspired a controversy or 
two, even a nasty rumor or two, during the course of his stupendous career. 
Overall, though, the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers seems a fairly 
straight arrow, so we doubt that he will be lighting up the French Quarter's 
night life, or be caught checking out any up-and-coming Blaze Starrs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when there's a Super Bowl party in New Orleans, brace yourself for 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
When Len Dawson of the Kansas City Chiefs got here for Super Bowl IV, played at 
Tulane Stadium, the first news he got was not good. Coach Hank Stram came up to 
his quarterback to tell him that the Huntley-Brinkley news team on NBC-TV was 
about to report that Dawson's name had been linked with a sports-gambling 
inquiry, that an alleged gambler had been arrested with $400,000 and Dawson's 
phone number on his person. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your Super Bowl bummer. This didn't exactly put Dawson in the mood 
to play ball. And yet, he led the Chiefs to a 23-7 victory over Minnesota, and 
somehow has managed to remember that week with fondness rather than bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
Same with Craig Morton. When the quarterback of the Denver Broncos showed up 
for Super Bowl XII, all he yearned to talk about were his teammates and the 
Dallas Cowboys. All anybody else wanted to talk about were some Internal 
Revenue Service matters that Morton had pending. Morton was reluctant to show 
his face on Bourbon Street all week long, just because he was tired of 
everybody bringing up the same subject hour after hour. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't so lucky in the game, either, Denver doing the first of its Super 
Bowl fades, 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans is an exciting city, and you never know what to expect. For Super 
Bowl IX, Minnesota Coach Bud Grant tried to keep his players loose by not 
bothering to have a curfew. The Vikings lost anyway, to Pittsburgh, 16-6. For 
Super Bowl VI, Miami Coach Don Shula had ordered his players to be in their 
rooms by 11 p.m. Didn't work. The Dolphins lost anyway, to Dallas, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
That was the Super Bowl before which Richard M. Nixon telephoned Shula at 1:30 
in the morning with a blueprint for a pass play to Paul Warfield, which moved 
Lyndon B. Johnson to telegram Cowboy Coach Tom Landry: "My prayers will be with 
you in New Orleans, although I don't plan to send any plays." 
</P>
<P>
There was no dome back then. The temperature at Tulane at kickoff time was 39 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans' hotels were so solidly booked that week, the American Society of 
Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers volunteered to postpone their 
convention, freeing rooms for incoming football fans. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years later, the American Society of Refrigerated Football Players, 
numbering one in membership, came to New Orleans to have some fun and play some 
ball. William Perry of the Chicago Bears, a man who could walk down both sides 
of Bourbon Street at the same time, became the toast of the town, eating his 
way into Louisianans' hearts, and a few crawfish actually lived to tell about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know who will steal the show in New Orleans this week, before game 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Johnson of the Broncos is certainly a nominee. An all-league talker who 
will bust the eardrums of anybody who wants to hear about his Patrick 
Nagel-ripoff artwork, the Vance is once again, as was the case before his last 
two Super Bowl appearances, "ready to embrace stardom." Vance Johnson will 
never run out of conversation, as long as there is Vance Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Paris of the 49ers will make his pitch. There are certain days of certain 
years when Bubba can go up to Refrigerator Perry and call him Slim. When Bubba 
hits the N'Awlins restaurant district, prepare for some serious fork action. 
And, there are certain days when Bubba Paris can make Vance Johnson seem shy. 
</P>
<P>
As for the J. M. theory, who knows who will step forward to be the most 
talked-about fellow at this New Orleans Super Bowl? John Madden, maybe. Jim 
Murray. Jennifer Montana. Somebody. Maybe some Budweiser bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever he is, he'll probably be more interesting than the game.

NHL ALL-STAR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING FAVORITES IS NOTHING NEW 
</P>

<P>
The Boston Bruins weren't surprised they were ignored by Montreal Coach Pat 
Burns in the selections for this weekend's NHL All-Star game. Nor was New York 
Ranger Coach Roger Neilson, or New York Islanders center Bryan Trottier. 
</P>
<P>
Favoritism has always been a fact of life in the selection of players by the 
All-Star coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And this year isn't any different. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the coach picking the balance of the team," Neilson said. "We 
should pick them in order (of the voting) with a committee evaluating the 
situation. It puts too much pressure on the coach with his own team, and 
there's also politics." 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic case in point this year is Burns' added selections for his 
Wales Conference team which will face the Campbell Conference in today's 41st 
All-Star game at the Pittsburgh Penguins' Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
When Burns filled in his roster, he picked three of his own players -- Stephane 
Richer, Shayne Corson and Chris Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had two players in the starting lineup by virtue of the fans' 
balloting -- defenseman Ray Bourque and right wing Cam Neeley. None of the 
other Boston players were added to the Wales roster, even though the Bruins 
were leading the Adams Division at the time of selection. 
</P>
<P>
Bourque felt the Bruins were ignored by Burns in a personal vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect any of our players to get any favors from Pat Burns," Bourque 
said. "Last year, the Canadiens were angry that (former Boston coach) Terry 
O'Reilly picked Bruins instead of Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
"Burns was just repaying the compliment and that's understandable. But still, I 
thought at least one of our goalies (Rejean Lemelin and Andy Moog) deserved to 
be chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Trottier wouldn't disagree. Nor would he dispute the fact that the coaches are 
biased in their selections. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there's favoritism by the coaches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The element of fans voting for the starting All-Star teams has been just as 
controversial. Some NHL coaches and players have complained that the fans don't 
always select the best players, or the ones who are most deserving. 
</P>
<P>
Example: Philadelphia's Brian Propp, who was injured most of the season, yet 
was voted in by the fans as the starting left wing for the Wales Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The best system was before, when the Professional Hockey Writers Association 
chose the team," said Mike Gartner, the Minnesota North Stars' representative 
on this year's Campbell Conference team. "Or the players themselves would 
probably do a better job. I don't like the present system. It's not fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying fans deserve no say, but it becomes mostly a popularity 
contest. The coaches don't do much better, especially when they are trying to 
fill a deficiency at a certain position. They take their own players instead of 
other more deserving guys." 
</P>
<P>
Neilson is another who doesn't care for the fans' voting. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets the fans into the game," he said, "but it doesn't always get the best 
players. They have to find some way to prevent stuffing ballot boxes. We need a 
better system. It's nice to get fans involved, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Trottier is ambivalent about this aspect of the All-Star situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a popularity contest -- some areas fill out more ballots," he said. 
"But it's good to get the fans involved. The more they vote, the better chance 
for their teams." 
</P>
<P>
As for the rule that every team must have All-Star representation, there is 
generally no argument about that. 
</P>
<P>
"The format has always been that way (with each team being represented) and 
it's very popular," Trottier said. "The TV networks need it, it gives exposure 
to all areas."

HOCKEY LEGENDS RETURN TO ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In his day, he was the fastest of the fabled "Flying Frenchmen." Speed was his 
forte, his trademark on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
When Yvan Cournoyer stepped on the Civic Arena ice Saturday afternoon for the 
National Hockey League's Heroes of Hockey game, he did do so knowing no one 
expected him to be as fast as he was when he played for the Montreal Canadiens 
from 1964-1979. But he also realized they expected him to be Yvan Cournoyer, 
Hall of Famer. And he expected the same. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I stopped skating," said Cournoyer, who last played in a formal 
old-timers' game two years ago in a two-game series against the 1972 Soviet 
team. "It's not that easy to do what you once did. It can be frustrating. When 
you step on the ice, you give 100 percent. And that's a hard thing to do if you 
don't play much. It was hard for me. When you step on the ice, you become a 
different guy." 
</P>
<P>
OK, not different in the sense that he might suddenly have a desire to separate 
Stan Mikita's head from the rest of his body. And not different in the sense 
that he might want to prove he still has a shot that commands respect. But 
different in the sense that while he can joke about the deterioration of his 
hockey skills, he is not eager to show everybody how deteriorated they really 
are. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's got their pride, I think," said Cournoyer, who runs a restaurant 
in Montreal and works for Molson's brewery. "We're going to do our best. We 
don't want to go out and look stupid." 
</P>
<P>
That's the funny thing about old-timers' games. Everybody talks primarily of 
the camaraderie of such occasions and the renewal of old friendships, but 
nobody talks much about the game. It is only in passing that a participant will 
tell you that for the past month he has been working out, or running, or 
playing tennis, or skating, or doing whatever to get into and/or stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"You say yes to a game like this, but people don't realize what's involved. 
Guys will say they haven't been on skates for years, but they get out there and 
they look good. You've got to work out or else you could look bad." 
</P>
<P>
So Cournoyer has been running. Mikita has been playing in an alumni league. 
Henri Richard has taken up tennis. Rod Gilbert has been hitting the weight 
room. 
</P>
<P>
They came to Pittsburgh because it is an honor to play in such a game, and they 
will have fun, most of it off the ice. But they won't have fun if they can't 
skate. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Mikita played in the Civic Arena many times in his 22-year Hall of Fame 
career, but when he came to town with the Chicago Blackhawks he was never as 
hard to please as he is now. Certainly, he never came with this specific list 
of demands: "What I want for this game is beer on the bench, rubber hockey 
sticks, no backchecking and some oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
The sticks will not be rubber, but neither will they be raised in anger. 
Mikita, 49, is a veteran of what are known around the NHL as "alumni games." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the sound of the word, 'old-timers,' " said Mikita, the 
Blackhawks' all-time leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
A number of NHL teams arrange games for former players against civic groups to 
raise money for charity. Mikita plays in one in the Chicago area. He also has 
played in celebrity games held before NHL games in recent years. Plus, he says, 
he has not lost a step from his playing days. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm back to my old speeds -- slow and stop." 
</P>
<P>
Mikita calls the alumni games "shinny," which he likens to games of pond hockey 
he played as boy. Saturday's game would be more formal, but it would follow 
some shinny rules. 
</P>
<P>
"No checking. No slap shots. And no body contact, even by accident." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Mikita believes the game can be entertaining for the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"The speed will be a little slower than what they're used to, but they will see 
some good stickhandling and some good passing. And who knows, with (Keith) 
Magnuson around, there might be a little fracas, too." 
</P>
<P>
Henri Richard, a.k.a. "the Pocket Rocket," has never stopped playing in alumni 
games, but in Montreal, they don't call them that. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it the Depression League," said Richard, a Hall of Famer who played 
for the Canadiens from 1955-1975. "I've been playing for 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, 54, plays about 40 games a year. "I enjoy it; I really do." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mahavolich, restaurateur. He likes the sound of that. Mahavolich, the 
former Canadien, Penguin and Detroit Red Wing, is opening a restaurant in Glens 
Falls, N.Y., which is where his hockey career ended nine years ago. Getting the 
restaurant started has been difficult for Mahavolich. It has kept him off 
skates for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I decided to play was that Bryan Watson (the game's organizer) 
called me and he's a good friend," said Mahavolich, 43. "I see the game as a 
nice opportunity to get back with people I used to know and play with. The 
important thing about these games is to have a good time. I'm happy to be 
playing, but I might need skates with training wheels." 
</P>
<P>
When he played for the Boston Bruins, Johnny Bucyk rarely was knocked off his 
skates. A Hall of Famer, Bucyk played 23 seasons. As a member of the Bruins' 
alumni team, he plays once or twice a week, although his job as Boston radio 
announcer takes him out of town often. But when hockey season ends, he hangs up 
his skates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm either fishing up or playing golf," said Bucyk. "I think the fans will be 
surprised to see how much good passing there will be in this game. We play the 
game hard and you do want to score, but the top thing is you don't want to get 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Delvecchio, a former Red Wing Hall of Famer, is 58, but he is eager to 
skate in public with men, some of whom are 15 or more years his junior. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an easy decision," said Delvecchio, who runs an advertising business in 
suburban Detroit and skates at least twice a week with a Red Wings alumni team. 
"First, it's quite an honor to be asked, especially since I'll be an honorary 
captain. Second, it will be a great honor for me to meet men like (Wayne) 
Gretzky, Lemieux and (Paul) Coffey. I look forward to swapping stories with the 
stars of today. But most of all, it makes us feel young again." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Gilbert's back hurts. And he blames it all on "Heroes of Hockey." 
</P>
<P>
"The closer you get to a game like this, the more excited you get. I'm out 
getting ready. But I'm a lot closer to 50 than I am to 40, and I've had two 
spinal fusions and my back hurts. That's why I stopped playing in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gilbert believes he must get ready. The presence of recently retired 
players such as Brad Park, Denis Potvin and Darryl Sittler increases his 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be competitive. I played a game like this in Toronto last 
year and I was surprised how competitive it was. You know guys like Park and 
Potvin can still play. You've got to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, former Rangers star, works in the Rangers' front office. He and Eddie 
Giacomin put on youth hockey clinics in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
"I come back mostly to see old teammates like Andy Bathgate and Harry Howell, 
who I haven't seen in years. And maybe I can get back at (goaltender) Billy 
Smith for all the things he did to me by shooting high on him in warmups. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I really want to do in this game is what I wanted to do when I 
played: score."

A GRUDGE MATCH AT HARMON ARENA; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: UCLA'S DON MACLEAN IS STILL FUMING OVER THE WAY IN WHICH HE WAS 
HANDLED BY CAL COACH LOU CAMPANELLI IN THE OLYMPIC FESTIVAL LAST SUMMER.

<P>
It will be a reunion of sorts today for Coach Lou Campanelli of California and 
forward Don MacLean of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect them to embrace. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean didn't like the way he was used last summer when he played for 
Campanelli in the Olympic Festival at Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, MacLean said that Campanelli held a grudge against him because, in 
two Bruin victories last season, MacLean averaged 26 points and nine rebounds 
against the Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Campanelli indicated that he had a more plausible reason for benching MacLean 
at crucial times for his West team. 
</P>
<P>
"You are useless on defense," he shouted at MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, MacLean was angered by the way he was treated and said 
the other day that he will be especially motivated this afternoon when the 
Bruins play the Golden Bears at Harmon Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really as mad as I was," he said, "but I still want to play really 
well against him, and I still really want to beat them. I'm sure once I get up 
there and see him, I'll really be fired up to play." 
</P>
<P>
Campanelli doesn't understand the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding MacLean's contention that Campanelli had personal reasons for 
benching the Bruin forward, Campanelli said: "That's absolutely ridiculous. 
There's nothing further from the truth. I wanted them all to do well." 
</P>
<P>
According to festival rules, teams were divided into two units of six players, 
with each platoon scheduled for 10 minutes of play in the first half and six in 
the second. Free substitution was allowed in the last eight minutes, which is 
when Campanelli benched MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not his college coach," Campanelli said. "I don't have to cater to him and 
tell him he's the star and he's the man. I'm just a college coach who was asked 
to come in and try to develop players. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Don quite understood that there were other great players there. 
It wasn't like a high school situation or college situation where he was the 
'go-to guy.' They were all great players. Don couldn't quite understand that. 
Maybe it was his ego, but all the other players understood it." 
</P>
<P>
While MacLean sat and stewed, Campanelli used forwards Adam Keefe of Stanford 
and Reggie Smith of Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what he felt," MacLean said of Campanelli, "but I felt I 
was one of the best players, if not the best, and he didn't play me. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand why because I was working as hard as anybody else in 
practice. No way those guys were as good as I was." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, though, said that he never confronted Campanelli. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really talk to the team," MacLean said. "He never said, 'Don, you've 
got to pick up your game,' or, 'You've got to start working harder.' So, I 
figured he just had something against me." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, Campanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining his reasoning at the time, Campanelli said of MacLean, who 
established a Pac-10 freshman scoring record last season: "He's had some 
problems on defense and basically that's been it. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to go with the most complete guys at crunch time -- guys who can 
rebound and block shots, not just score." 
</P>
<P>
Campanelli held no grudge then, nor does he now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish Don nothing but the best," Campanelli said. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean wouldn't say the same about his one-time coach.

NEW COLISEUM WOULD INCLUDE TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those concerned that the proposed renovation of the Coliseum will eliminate the 
track, thus eliminating Los Angeles from consideration for major meets, 
shouldn't despair. 
</P>
<P>
One plan under consideration would spare the track, although it would be hidden 
under retractable seating during the football season. 
</P>
<P>
Another plan would remove the track but allow for a temporary track for 
significant meets. Los Angeles is bidding for the 1992 Olympic trials and the 
1995 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the modernized but perhaps smaller Coliseum would be approved by the 
International Olympic Committee is another matter. But who is seriously talking 
about bringing another Summer Olympics to Los Angeles within the foreseeable 
future? 
</P>
<P>
Harry Usher, for one. 
</P>
<P>
Usher, general manager of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, said last week 
that he believes it could be Los Angeles' turn again as soon as 2004. He would 
get an argument from New York and Washington organizers, who are promoting 
their cities for 2004. Then there are the Atlanta folks, who presume their city 
will be the next one in the United States to stage the Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta is the designated U.S. bid city for the 1996 Summer Olympics, the site 
of which will be determined by the IOC in September. John Rodda, a respected 
journalist from the Guardian in England, wrote recently that Toronto is the 
front-runner for 1996, ahead of sentimental favorite Athens. But he wasn't 
unkind to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta is running late but strong. . . . But perhaps it is a little too soon 
after Los Angeles to go to the States and a little too uncomfortable at the 
height of the summer to go to Georgia," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the destiny of the Coliseum, it will not affect the 1991 U.S. Olympic 
Festival in Los Angeles. Tentative venues announced last week did not include 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have 50,000 people for the opening ceremony, that would look inadequate 
at the Coliseum," Usher said. "But 50,000 people at Dodger Stadium would be 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
He said Dodger Stadium is one of the possibilities for the opening ceremony. 
The track and field competition probably will be held at UCLA's Drake Stadium, 
which would be expanded to a capacity of 20,000 with temporary seating. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed venues for other major sports include basketball at Pauley Pavilion, 
boxing and gymnastics at the Forum, figure skating at the Sports Arena and 
swimming and diving at USC's McDonald's Olympic Pool. 
</P>
<P>
In the biggest gambling scandal in England in more than 20 years, the coach and 
chairman of a soccer team, Swindon, have been charged with betting against 
their team. "Say It Ain't So, Lou," read one London newspaper headline, 
referring to Coach Lou Macari. 
</P>
<P>
Macari and the team's chairman, Brian Hillier, allegedly won $7,000 by betting 
against their team before its 5-0 loss to heavily favored Newcastle in a 1988 
FA Cup game. They reportedly needed the money to pay the team's hotel bill in 
Newcastle. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Mills of Northfield, Ill., won the world junior figure skating 
championship in 1989 while training under Barbara Roles in Harbor City, but she 
has been fading since. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing second to Kyoko Ina in the junior national meet last year, 
Mills moved to the East Coast to train with Ina's coach, Peter Burrows. But 
that hasn't helped. She finished sixth in the Midwest sectional last week and 
did not qualify for senior national, which will be held Feb. 6-11 in Salt Lake 
City. Mills has plenty of time to recover. She's only 15. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise in the qualifying for the national occurred at the Pacific 
Coast sectional in San Diego, where Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Todd 
Sand of Irvine finished first in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
Skating in Costa Mesa for John Nicks, who also has taken on defending national 
champions Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo since their coach, Jim Hulick, died 
recently, Kuchiki and Sand now are among the medal favorites at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they win, they will not be able to represent the United States at 
the World Championships in Halifax, Canada, because Kuchiki is only 13. Skaters 
have to be at least 14 to compete for world titles. 
</P>
<P>
The United States may lack the talent to compete with many of the world's best 
soccer teams, but it is not short of goalkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Virginia's Tony Meola won the Hermann Award as college 
soccer's top player last season and had four shutouts in four starts in the 
World Cup qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But when he missed the recent two-week training camp at La Jolla while trying 
out for an English team, he wasn't missed because of the play of the University 
of Portland's Kasey Keller. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problems with putting Kasey in goal against anyone at any time," 
Coach Bob Gansler said. "Obviously, Tony did a tremendous job for us. But Kasey 
is every bit as talented." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gansler said he might have invited Keller to join the national team at 
midseason last year instead of Meola if Keller hadn't been playing in France 
with the national B team. 
</P>
<P>
Both Meola and Keller will be with the national team in its first games of the 
year, Feb. 2 and 4, at the Marlboro Cup of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
More Coliseum: David Simon, president of the L.A. Sports Council, said he has 
been assured that a remodeled Coliseum would still be suitable for 1994 World 
Cup soccer games. "That's a high priority for the Spectacor people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum and the Rose Bowl are among the favorites as sites for the World 
Cup's most significant games, such as the opener, the semifinals and the final. 
A site-inspection committee from World Cup '94 will be in Los Angeles next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite is Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium, which Robbie had built to 
comply with international soccer specifications. The effect that his recent 
death will have on Miami's bid remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for someone in the Greater Miami area to pick up the slack," 
said Scott LeTellier, president of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Romania's Maricica Puica, gold medalist at 3,000 meters in the 1984 Summer 
Olympics, who returned to Los Angeles as Paula Ivan's coach for Friday night's 
Sunkist Invitational, defended Nadia Comaneci, saying that she had lived in a 
gilded cage in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw in Time and Newsweek that she lived like a rock star," Puica said. "This 
is not true. Nadia had many invitations to go all over the world, but they only 
let her come here in 1984 (for the Olympics) because (Peter) Ueberroth 
insisted. She was in prison in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy for her that she left. I was sorry that she didn't do it earlier. 
She sacrificed her childhood to achieve what she achieved in her sport." 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci also is in Los Angeles, making a movie about her life. On "The Pat 
Sajak Show" last week, she said she wants to coach gymnasts in the United 
States. She had said previously that she didn't want to be involved in the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan, making a comeback on the indoor track circuit, was to 
run his signature event, the mile, Saturday night at a meet in Portland. He had 
said previously that he wanted to run only the 3,000. What will he run at the 
Forum on Feb. 16 in the Times/Eagle meet? 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever he wants," promoter Will Kern said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis said recently he thinks Ben Johnson is still on steroids. A few days 
later, he released a revised statement through his Canadian attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know whether Ben Johnson is using steroids or any other drugs, and I 
regret that any comments attributed to me were construed that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdler Renaldo Nehemiah told the Washington Post that Lewis is "consumed with 
Ben Johnson."

TROJANS' LATEST DEFEAT LOOKS FAMILIAR;

USC: STANFORD GETS SHAKEN UP AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME AND ROLLS TO 74-61 
VICTORY. COLEMAN BREAKS SLUMP WITH 21 POINTS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanford basketball Coach Mike Montgomery was angry after watching his team 
play poorly in the first half of Saturday's game against USC. 
</P>
<P>
After Trojan guard Harold Miner sank a three-point shot with one second left in 
the first half to give USC a 34-32 lead, Montgomery grabbed Stanford guard 
Marcus Lollie, who had left Miner open, and flung Lollie off the court in 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an overreaction on my part," Montgomery said. "I thought we had a 
chance to get a little momentum going in and we let it slip away on that last 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
After Montgomery blew up, the Cardinal exploded in the second half, outscoring 
USC, 42-27, en route to a 74-61 Pacific 10 Conference victory before 5,200 at 
Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
After beating No. 16 UCLA Thursday night, Stanford came out flat against USC. 
But the Cardinal outscored the Trojans, 23-9, in the first nine minutes of the 
second half to take control. 
</P>
<P>
"This was probably a tougher game than many people thought," Montgomery said. 
"We were not particularly aggressive in the first half and we didn't seem to 
get our adrenaline going." 
</P>
<P>
But the Cardinal was flowing in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford has the physical size and they just wore us down," USC Coach George 
Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Guard John Patrick scored 12 of his team-high 17 points in the second half. 
Patrick hit five of nine three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Center Adam Keefe added 15 points and Kenny Ammann and Deshon Wingate had 12 
apiece. Forward Andrew Vlahov added 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal (12-3, 4-2 in league play) also outrebounded the Trojans, 38-22. 
Keefe had a game-high 12 rebounds and Wingate had a season-high 11. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever they're paying that weight training coach they ought to be giving him 
more, because he's doing a helluva job," Raveling said. "Stanford would look 
good at Muscle Beach." 
</P>
<P>
It was the same old story for USC (6-8, 1-6), which has wasted halftime leads 
in four of its past five games. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that concerns me is that we've fallen into a pattern in our 
last four or five games of playing quality basketball for 20 minutes in a game 
that's played for 40 minutes," Raveling said. "If we were in a contest for 20 
minutes, we'd probably be in the top 20 in the country right now, but 
unfortunately we play for 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure why we're not able to sustain a 40-minute effort. We had this in 
the Notre Dame game, the Arizona game, the Cal game and this game. So I think 
what we as a staff have to do is to look at how we can sustain a 20-minute 
effort into a 40-minute effort." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 14 games, Raveling changed his starting lineup, inserting 
freshman Rodney Chatman at point guard in place of Robert Pack, who wasn't 
doing a good job of directing the team. 
</P>
<P>
Chatman celebrated his 20th birthday by scoring eight points and passing off 
for six assists in 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
USC played as well as it can play in the first half, shooting 60.9% from the 
floor, hitting 14 of 23 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojans were unable to shake Stanford, which trailed by two points 
despite shooting just 36.7% in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman, who had scored only 24 points in his past three games, 
broke out of his slump by scoring 21 points -- but only five in the second 
half. He has 1,001 points during his three-year USC career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to see him get back in his rhythm of things," Raveling said. "He 
needed a good physical game like this where he got banged around inside."

IN SEARCH OF A BETTER FREE THROW

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people say he was the greatest basketball player of all time. Wilt 
Chamberlain, the ultimate inside force, dominated professional basketball in 
the 1960s the way few players have before or since. 
</P>
<P>
He was a four-time most valuable player and seven-time scoring leader. He is 
one of only two players to score more than 30,000 career points and the only 
player to average more than 30 points in a career. 
</P>
<P>
But even during Chamberlain's prime, if you placed him only 15 feet away from 
the basket with nobody guarding him and the action ground to a halt, he would 
toss up enough bricks to build a couple of houses and still have plenty left 
for a backyard barbecue grill. 
</P>
<P>
The free throw, supposedly the easiest shot in basketball, has confounded even 
the greatest players over the years. 
</P>
<P>
For every Larry Bird (lifetime free-throw percentage of nearly .880), there is 
a Chamberlain (51-percent career average, all-time low of 38 percent in 
1967-68) providing evidence that the free throw actually is the biggest mental 
game of any sport. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about such a simple shot that can turn some of the world's best 
athletes into such helpless bricklayers? How can a national powerhouse such as 
Syracuse last year shoot only 61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's all in the wording. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the name: free throw. The name itself suggests this is a shot 
that is so easy you can't miss," Birmingham-Southern Coach Duane Reboul said. 
"There's initial pressure just by the title of the shot. That's where it 
begins. Some people walk up to the line and say, 'I'm supposed to make this 
shot,' and start thinking about the result as opposed to just doing the 
fundamentals correctly. Once you start thinking about the shot, you're in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But what else is there to think about? In a game of almost constant motion, the 
action is stopped. All eyes in the arena are focused on the free-throw shooter, 
whose shots might be the difference. 
</P>
<P>
How can you not think about the shot? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy," said Alabama Birmingham forward Andy Kennedy, who sank 85 
percent of his attempts last year. "But it's all just a mind game. When I'm on 
the line and I catch myself thinking about the importance of a free throw, I 
just shut it out and think about practice. I start talking to myself -- you can 
probably see my lips move -- and I'm saying, 'Just like in practice.' Then I 
just go up there and knock them both in and don't even think about the 
importance of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is such an up-and-down game. It's constant motion. And suddenly you 
get fouled and everything stops. It's just you and the rim. It's a big change 
in the flow of the game and a lot of people don't handle it very well." 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't have let it (the free throws) bother me so much. But I wanted to 
excel at everything. And the harder I tried, the more different ways I tried to 
shoot, the worse I got." -- Chamberlain in his 1973 autobiography "Wilt." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most difficult situations a basketball coach faces is deciding what 
to do with a poor free-throw shooter. Some coaches let the players work out 
their own problems; others push players during practice to work on technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had several players over the years that I shuddered whenever they went to 
the free-throw line," UAB Coach Gene Bartow said. "But I think you can take 
most anybody and if you work with them on their form and release and they 
practice it, then they'll get better. But they have to be dedicated to getting 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilt Chamberlain was a horrible free-throw shooter. But I feel if I could have 
had him for 10 minutes a day, I eventually could have had him shooting 70 
percent. But I couldn't if he wouldn't listen to me, and knowing Wilt like I 
know him, he probably wouldn't have listened." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that poor free-throw shooters can improve. During his first 
two seasons at Alabama, guard Bryant Lancaster made only seven of 31 free-throw 
attempts (22.6%). 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't stand to go to the line," Lancaster said. "That's how bad my 
confidence was last year." 
</P>
<P>
But Lancaster worked long and hard on his shooting during the off-season, then 
received that all-important mental boost from Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson when 
he named Lancaster a starter at the shooting guard position in preseason. He 
made 15 of his first 19 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, South Florida center Hakim Shahid sank only 55% of his attempts. 
So during the off-season, he practiced on his own. There was no coach or 
adviser standing over his shoulder telling him what to do. He simply worked on 
the shot until it felt right. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Shahid is making 83% of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind the fragile mentality of free-throw shooters, USF coach Bobby 
Paschal has avoided talking to Shahid about his newfound accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him to spend a lot of time working on his free throws over the 
off-season, and apparently he did," Paschal said. "When I saw during preseason 
practice that he was shooting the ball so well, I just shut up. I figure I'd 
better leave well enough alone." 
</P>
<P>
The silent treatment is a technique some coaches prefer in curing a player's 
free-throw ills. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start talking about it and spending too much time at practice saying 
how important free throws are," Reboul said, "then every time a guy goes to the 
line he starts thinking about all that rather than the mechanics. I've never 
had a team shoot free throws poorly and I've always used this approach." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Historic moments in free-throw shooting, No. 2: June 25, 1977. Ted St. 
Martin sets up a basketball goal in a Jacksonville, Fla., shopping mall and 
begins shooting. He doesn't stop until sinking 2,036 consecutive free throws, 
still the world record. The 5-7 St. Martin was 41 years old at the time. On 
Saturday, during halftime of the Duke-Wake Forest game, St. Martin, who is now 
54, will attempt to break his record of 169 free-throw conversions in 10 
minutes. That is 17 free throws per minute, or one every 3.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Martin believes free-throw shooting is one of the easiest plays in all of 
sports and any decent athlete should make the shot with regularity. No excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for anybody not to make the shot at least 75 percent of the 
time," St. Martin said. "It's such a simple shot." 
</P>
<P>
St. Martin said the technique and form needed to become a consistent free-throw 
shooter is so basic that anybody can learn it with a little practice. So he is 
convinced that players who have trouble sinking the shot either haven't 
practiced enough or let their mind wander at the line. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is mental," St. Martin said. "I used to be exactly like these 
other guys. I'd get a string going and start thinking, 'It's time to miss.' You 
can't have that in your mind." 
</P>
<P>
St. Martin lists seven basic steps for success: 
</P>
<P>
1) Be comfortable. "If you're tense, then your body is tense and your motion 
will be tight and unnatural." 
</P>
<P>
2) Have a soft grip on the ball. "I hold it like I'm holding an egg. This gives 
you a smooth delivery and follow-through." 
</P>
<P>
3) Use a high arc. "This is where much of the problem is for people. They shoot 
the ball too flat." 
</P>
<P>
4) Have a soft rotation. "Too much and the ball will roll out." 
</P>
<P>
5) Eliminate unnecessary body motion. "The more you eliminate movement, the 
less chance for error. Some guys get up there and bend over like they're trying 
to tie their shoes. This is especially important in clutch situations, because 
you're a little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
6) Keep your eye on the rim. "Don't watch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
7) Don't stand at the line too long. "You're defeating yourself. You don't want 
to be in a hurry, but if you stand there, you start thinking about the shot." 
</P>
<P>
St. Martin rattles off this list as if he has experience teaching a class. But 
actually, he said very few teams inquire about his services. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get as many requests as I should," he said. "It's a shame. I can 
definitely help because the shot is so teachable." 
</P>
<P>
It has been established, then, that this shot, which frustrates so many 
talented athletes, actually is so easy it's a joke. Then what's the problem? 
How can so many be so bad doing something so basic? 
</P>
<P>
South Florida's Paschal has an interesting theory. 
</P>
<P>
"So many guys who play basketball in college started playing when they were 
kids on playgrounds and in pickup games," Paschal said. "Even once they get to 
college, during the offseason most of the guys just go to the gym and get in a 
pickup game. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, one of the things guys don't do much of in pickup games is shoot foul 
shots. That's why we emphasize to our players that they shouldn't just spend 
time during the off-season playing pickup games. We tell them they've got to 
work on their shooting as well." 
</P>
<P>
Paschal said he believes the lack of free-throw shooting on city playgrounds 
carries over to high school, where the shot seldom is emphasized. As a result, 
high school players don't learn the basics of shooting free throws. By the time 
they get to college, Paschal said, they already have established bad habits 
that are hard to break. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Historic moments in free-throw shooting, No. 3: March 12, 1971. Boston 
Celtic rookie Garfield Smith goes to the line in a three-for-two bonus 
situation (three attempts to make two shots, a rule that no longer exists). 
Smith, only a 39% free-throw shooter anyway, tosses up three consecutive 
airballs. One misses to the left, one to the right and one is considerably 
short. None of the three comes close to the rim. Smith is out of the NBA the 
following season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game where the Garfield Smiths and the Chris Dudleys are immortalized 
because of their poor shooting, UAB's Bartow said there is one important thing 
to remember: Good shooters will make their free throws regardless of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen a great shooter, a guy who has great form and technique in 
his shooting, who wasn't able to go to that free-throw line and shoot at least 
75 and usually in the 80s," he said. "It's a very, very, very important part of 
the game that you try to have as good as you can. If you don't, then you're in 
trouble."

PAYTON'S PLACE: BEST IN THE COUNTRY? 
</P>

<P>
Gary Payton calls himself the best guard in college basketball. His coach says 
that's an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best player in the country, period," Jim Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
While others are getting more attention, Payton is accumulating a set of 
statistics that are unmatched among backcourt players in the NCAA's Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Going in to this week's games, the 6-foot-4 senior was 10th nationally in 
scoring (27.3 points per game), third in assists (9.4) and fourth in steals 
(3.6), leading Oregon State to the No. 18 spot in the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
If he continues at his current pace, he'll become college basketball's all-time 
assist leader. 
</P>
<P>
Payton figures the statistics show he's the best at his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should be ranked number one because I do a lot of things," he said. 
"You know Rumeal Robinson and Chris Jackson, all those people, are great 
players. Rumeal is a scorer and Chris is a scorer, too. But they don't do the 
things I do." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Los Angeles' Lakers' general manager and someone who knows a 
great guard when he sees one, thinks Payton is "right up at the head of the 
class" among college guards. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I like," West said, "is that late in the game he's not just a good 
player, he's a great player." 
</P>
<P>
There have been plenty of examples of that this season as Oregon State came 
from behind to win again and again. 
</P>
<P>
Against Louisiana Tech in the semifinals of the Far West Classic, he scored 
eight points and had an assist in the final 2:10 as the Beavers overcame an 
eight-point deficit to win 82-81. His four-foot jumper with nine seconds to 
play was the game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Against Oregon in the finals of the same tournament, he hit two free throws 
with six seconds to go to preserve a 71-68 win. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, he capped a 36-point performance with four in overtime as Oregon 
State won 77-76. Two days later at California, his team trailed 45-35 with 12 
1/2 minutes to go. But Payton scored 11 points and had three assists, two of 
them to set up three-pointers, as the Beavers rallied to win 64-58. 
</P>
<P>
And last weekend at Oregon, Payton scored 23 of his 30 points in the second 
half, including 10 of the Beavers' last 12, as Oregon State came from eight 
points behind to win 69-67. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's the second half and we're still down seven or eight and it's getting 
down to the 10-minute range, that's when I feel I've got to start doing more," 
Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I start going one-on-one and I start getting big buckets and that just 
motivates everybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he can tell when his star is about to take charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets on a roll, everybody sees it," Anderson said. "Players give him 
the ball. He works hard to get open. He just knows it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's fearless," Anderson said. "Nothing seems to daunt him, no matter 
the place or the player or the game or the situation. It seems like he loves 
those kinds of challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career at Oregon State, Payton has been known as a tenacious 
defender and terrific passer. His scoring, though, has been inconsistent. That 
changed this season when Anderson, who has been an assistant at Oregon State 
for 27 years, took over from venerable Ralph Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson loosened the reins and let Payton take control of the team. He's 
responded with some huge scoring games, including a 39-point performance at 
Tennessee and a 48-point effort, tying a school record, against Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that has made him a better player is we're giving him the ball more 
and giving him more freedom to exploit his abilities," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Payton have developed a close relationship since the days the 
coach recruited him at Skyline High in Oakland. A lot of schools backed off, 
Anderson said, because Payton's grades weren't good, especially in his early 
prep years, and there was concern about his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
But Payton has toned down his sometimes arrogant on-court manner and generally 
lets his basketball do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Anderson caused that maturity," Payton said. "He says I grew up a lot. 
He's been getting after me for four years. I know that I can play basketball. 
Everybody knows that I can play basketball, so all the extra stuff, all that's 
doing is making everything flare up some more. What he tells me is 'You know 
you can play basketball, you don't need all the extra stuff."' 
</P>
<P>
Payton was headed for St. John's, but the Redmen backed away from him at the 
last minute, and he opted for Oregon State. Now he's 228 points away from 
becoming the school's all-time leading scorer. He already is the team's career 
leader in steals and tops the Pac-10 all-time assist list. 
</P>
<P>
Payton was tempted to skip his senior year, but said he returned because his 
mother wanted him to finish his degree, because Miller told him he'd get a 
better NBA deal if he completed his senior season, and because he promised 
Anderson he'd play four years for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I see him as a father to me," Payton said of his coach. "We're really close. 
He talks to me about anything. Whatever's going on, I can talk to him about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
West says Payton is a sure bet to be a high draft choice. Whether he is the 
first guard selected will depend on his play in post-season and in all-star 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"If he keeps maturing, he'll be a terrific player" in the NBA, West said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said Payton's abilities are particularly suited to the pro version of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally feel he'll be a better pro than he is a college player," Anderson 
said. "I think he's going to be better where you have more of an emphasis on 
open-court basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"In a half-court defense or a half-court offense, I think he'll have some 
rivals, but when it comes to the open court, from one end to the other, I don't 
know if there's a player around that's better, and that includes the pros, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Payton is closing in on the NCAA career assist record of 960 held by Sherman 
Douglas of Syracuse. He needs to average 8.8 per game this season to break it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it every day," he said. "I've only got 126 to go. I know I can 
do it. I know that if I get the ball to my big man and my shooters, they're 
going to get it for me." 
</P>
<P>
If it means fewer points, he said, he doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the assist is more valuable to me than a score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true point guard.

OKLAHOMA LOSES BALL, SHOT AND THE GAME TO ARIZONA

Oklahoma had shooting troubles all game long against Arizona. But in the end, 
it was the shot the third-ranked Sooners didn't take that cost them Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit Holmes cost the Sooners a chance at the tying basket when he lost the 
ball out of bounds with four seconds left. Arizona's Sean Rooks was fouled one 
second later and made two free throws as the 23rd-ranked Wildcats won, 78-74. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first in three meetings over the last three years for the 
Wildcats (11-3), and marked the first time since 1987-88 that the Sooners 
(12-2) lost consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I made both of them, we'd beat Oklahoma," Rooks said of his two free 
throws, which clinched Arizona's 41st consecutive victory at home, the longest 
current streak in the nation. "That's a great feeling. I wasn't that confident, 
but I knew I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona limited the high-scoring Sooners to only seven of 28 shots in the first 
half and 24 for 69 for the game. In their two losses to Kansas State and 
Arizona, the Sooners scored a total of 125 points -- three more than their 
average in a 12-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
"You just hope to catch Oklahoma on a bad shooting night," Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson said. Olson also was pleased with the way his team handled Oklahoma's 
press. Matt Muehlebach, Harvey Mason and Matt Othick combined for only five 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners had a chance to tie, but Mike Harris, driving to the basket, 
attempted a bounce pass that Holmes couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
"The pass surprised me," said Holmes, who thought Harris "was going to shoot it 
the way he was penetrating." 
</P>
<P>
Rooks and Jud Buechler led the Wildcats with 18 points. Skeeter Henry led the 
Sooners with 14.

NEW MEXICO STATE GETS FULLERTON'S ATTENTION 
</P>

LAS CRUCES, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere in New Mexico State's arena, the third-place trophy from the 1970 
Final Four rests in dignity. 
</P>
<P>
But the trophy held in current esteem hangs from the rafters of the Pan 
American Center, a harpooned and bloodied fake shark that commemorates the 
Aggies' upset of Nevada Las Vegas less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton will not be so honored after its 75-58 loss to New Mexico 
State on Saturday in front of 11,791. It was too easy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Aggies (15-2) are bent on getting what they just missed last 
season, an invitation to the NCAA tournament. And they wouldn't mind a national 
ranking as well. 
</P>
<P>
If Fullerton Coach John Sneed had a vote after New Mexico State leap to a 28-8 
lead, the Aggies would get it. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out hot as fire," Sneed said. "Every possession -- on the boards, 
the three-pointer. They've got one vote for the top 20 here. They really do." 
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't 37 seconds old when New Mexico State's Michael New dunked off 
an alley-oop pass from Randy Brown. About 20 seconds later, Keith Hill made a 
three-point shot. Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos managed to score on a tip-in, but 
the Titans could not slow the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State's Reggie Jordan scored on an offensive rebound and the Aggies 
stole the ball, but missed two easy shots. New, who grabbed 15 rebounds and 
scored 11 points, followed with a dunk. Fullerton committed a turnover and 
Brown hit a three-point basket. The score was 12-2, with less than three 
minutes gone. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Fullerton (9-7, 3-4) trailed, 39-22, and had been outshot, 50% to 
31%, and outrebounded, 22-13. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton recovered somewhat in the second half, cutting the lead to 11. 
Ceballos and Mark Hill each scored 19 for the Titans, and David Moody added 13 
points and 10 rebounds, both career highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies' outburst was a tribute to their remarkably athletic talent and 
their ire after having their undefeated Big West Conference record spoiled in a 
72-56 loss to Cal State Long Beach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to the 49ers may have cost Coach Neil McCarthy's team its first 
national ranking since the end of the 1975 season. The loss also knocked the 
Aggies into a first-place tie in the Big West with UNLV. Each has one loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies other loss was to Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Aggies had a 21-11 record, the school's first 20-win season in 
10 years. But two of those victories were against non-Division I teams, which 
helped keep the Aggies out of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State had to settle for the National Invitation Tournament, and the 
disappointed Aggies were defeated in the first round by Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
This season they again have two non-Division I opponents. Their loss to Long 
Beach at the end of a three-game, four-day trip might cost them. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a ranking seems postponed, at best. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they'll have us in this week," McCarthy said. "I think they know 
where New Mexico is now. I think they know it's part of the United States. If 
we win our next four or five, maybe we'll get in." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's loss, its seventh in 10 road games, ends a stretch in which the 
Titans played nine of 11 on the road.

WORLD BASKETBALL LEAGUE IS MAKING IT BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLIAMS, MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Steve Ehrhart's first acts as World Basketball League commissioner was 
to tell David Stern, his National Basketball Association counterpart, "We're in 
no way going to be competing with you." 
</P>
<P>
Neither do the two leagues see eye-to-eye on matters of height or manner of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Memphis-based WBL stresses speedy, high-scoring games and is limited to 
players who are 6-foot-5 or smaller -- a height restriction that would 
eliminate the majority of NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
The WBL, which begins its third season in May, is truly a "world" league. North 
American teams play touring international non-league teams (which aren't 
subject to the height restriction) in games that count in WBL standings. The 
WBL plans to feature European and Asian divisions within three years. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the WBL concept appears to be catching on. 
</P>
<P>
"The average size in the NBA is now 6-9 (just over 6-7, the NBA claims)," said 
Ehrhart, 42, former executive director of the defunct United States Football 
League. "So many of the (NBA) players -- especially backup players -- are just 
not excellent athletes. They're there because they are big and big only. The 
most entertaining players are usually under 6-5. Michael Jordan told me he's 
pretty close." 
</P>
<P>
The WBL players don't play in Jordan's air space, nor for his astronomical 
salary. The league's five returning franchises from last season are in 
Youngstown, Ohio; Worcester, Mass.; Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Springfield, 
Ill.; and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis will have a team this season. Franchises also are expected in 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, and possibly in another American city. 
</P>
<P>
Top WBL players have included 6-4 Alfredrick Hughes of Loyola-Chicago, the 
fifth-leading scorer in NCAA history; 6-4 Perry McDonald, a two-year starter at 
Georgetown; and 6-4 Carlos Clark, a former Ole Miss star and member of the 1984 
NBA champion Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
The average salary is $15,000, and each team has a $150,000 annual salary cap. 
A team's typical annual budget is $750,000. By contrast, New York Knicks center 
Patrick Ewing last year earned an NBA-best salary of $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The WBL's lower salaries translate to lower ticket prices. League attendance 
averaged 2,700 in 1988 and 2,900 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Youngstown Pride, last year's league champs, have shown a 
single-season profit. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes some time because of the newness of the product," Ehrhart said. 
"We're still in the process of fighting for name recognition. There are people 
who haven't even heard of us." 
</P>
<P>
But by selling short, the WBL is able to make a strong pitch. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Close, fast-moving games. The average score is 111-107, Ehrhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Players don't foul out. Beginning with a player's seventh foul, the 
opposition gets a foul shot or shots and possession. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In overtime, the first team to seven points wins. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The WBL uses the international three-point line of 20-feet, 6-inches. The 
NBA's line ranges from 22 feet on the baseline to 23-9 at the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A player fouled on a three-point try receives three free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The WBL also is entering the second year of a three-year television deal worth 
nearly $2 million with cable network SportsChannel America. 
</P>
<P>
Officials think the NBA and WBL can coexist. They also believe that WBL owners 
may one day have the chance to own NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us the opportunity to prove ourselves with this team," Memphis 
interim general manager Pat Carter said. "Hopefully, we'd be in line, in 
consideration for an NBA team." 
</P>
<P>
The WBL seems to be doing legwork for the NBA on matters of expansion, in the 
United States and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"No question," Ehrhart said. "They're watching us." 
</P>
<P>
But NBA Vice President for Public Relations Bryan McIntyre said the league 
isn't watching the WBL's international expansion plans. He called the NBA, 
whose teams have played overseas exhibitions, "the top professional league for 
basketball in the world." 
</P>
<P>
A group including investors and promoters contacted Ehrhart in late 1987 about 
becoming commissioner. When he took the job in early '88, Ehrhart virtually was 
in a league by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"No players had been signed," he said. "They were debating whether to make the 
height 6-4 or 6-5. There was no name for the league." 
</P>
<P>
And the league was to begin play in May. "That was just a total all-out sprint 
to get stadiums, dates, players signed, rules adopted and published -- to tell 
people who we are and what we are, battle for recognition," he said.

PEPPERDINE COMES BACK AND BEATS GONZAGA, 68-67 
</P>

<P>
With Gonzaga holding a 56-41 lead over Pepperdine with 8:34 to play, it looked 
as if it was going to be an easy victory for the Bulldogs Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Waves picked themselves up and somehow beat Gonzaga, 68-67, before 
2,317 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Shann Ferch's layup with 11 seconds remaining provided the decisive points for 
Pepperdine, which improved to 8-9 overall and 2-2 in the West Coast Conference. 
Gonzaga fell to 6-11 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
"After the year we've had, I figured we had to have a win like this," 
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. "We've had to many (go) in the other 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been letting people come in and play, and we have to get our backs to 
the wall," Asbury said. "We've done that so many times this year and quit. 
Tonight we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Howard made one of two free throws to signal the start of a 13-0 run, 
and Pepperdine was on track, pulling within 56-54 with 5:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
There were two consecutive three-point baskets, one by Rick Welch and the other 
by Doug Christie. 
</P>
<P>
Then Christie stole the ball near the Gonzaga basket and drove for a dunk. Not 
to be outdone, Welch also made a backcourt steal and scored on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
But Pepperdine, which trailed at halftime, 40-31, didn't take a second-half 
lead until there was 1:31 remaining. That's when Craig Davis hit a 
three-pointer that made it 63-61. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Geoff Lear, who made some key rebounds down the stretch, 
extended the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McPhee, who scored a game-high 23 points, followed with a three-pointer, 
but Ferch made it 68-64 for Pepperdine with his layup with 11 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga's Darryl May made a three-pointer as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Christie scored 19 points on eight-of-14 shooting, Lear had 16 points and 10 
rebounds, and Ferch, who made three of three three-point shots, had 11 points.

PISTONS' EDWARDS SEEKS HAPPY ENDING TO SAGA

James Edwards' favorite daytime drama is "One Life to Live," which is perfect 
for a guy whose NBA career has had more subplots than a soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's getting pregnant all the time, but there's always a lot of stuff 
going on," he says. "Sometimes my life sure does seem like a soap opera." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, in his 13th year, is with his fifth team since being the 46th player 
chosen in the 1977 draft and one of those tours of duty had him caught up in a 
drug scandal in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But this story might have a happy ending yet. Edwards is starting for the first 
time in four years and he's making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
In his first 21 games as a starter Edwards, who was averaging 5.7 points per 
game as a reserve, came to life with a 13.9 average, and the Pistons went on a 
15-6 streak. In the last 10 of those 21 games, Edwards has averaged 17.6 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
"They're calling my number more often," says the 7-foot-1 center whose drooping 
mustache and catlike smile have earned him the nickname Buddha. "I'm getting 
the ball in good low-post positions where I can either spin inside or shoot 
from the baseline." 
</P>
<P>
What pleases Piston Coach Chuck Daly even more than the extra offense is the 
way Edwards has begun to play defense, something he had been a little soft on 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent victory over the New York Knicks, he held Patrick Ewing to just 
three points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy has really been hitting some big shots for us lately," Daly says. "He's 
playing about as well as I've ever seen him." 
</P>
<P>
But it has certainly been an uneven road. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I was a starter must have been about four years ago in Phoenix," 
he says. "It's working out better now." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who also has a passion for playing Nintendo, would just as soon zap 
his Phoenix experience. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was among 13 people, including four Suns players, indicted in Phoenix 
by a Maricopa County grand jury investigating drug use in the area in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was indicted on three counts -- conspiracy to possess a narcotic drug, 
conspiracy to transfer a narcotic drug and conspiracy to transfer or possess 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
According to court transcripts, Edwards was accused of supplying or offering to 
supply drugs to several people, including then-Sun rookie William Bedford, who 
made the Piston roster this season after years in rehabilitation clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Later in 1987, Edwards officially entered a yearlong counseling program in 
Phoenix as part of a plea-bargain agreement that led to the dismissal of all 
three charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
"That part of his life is behind him, and has been for quite some time now," 
says Jack McCloskey, the Piston general manager. "James now is a solid citizen. 
He's heavily involved in several charities both in Phoenix and in the Detroit 
area." 
</P>
<P>
But even McCloskey became involved in the soap-opera aspect of Edwards' life 
last spring when he left popular Rick Mahorn unprotected in the expansion 
draft. Everyone thought Edwards should have been the one left unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the critics are silent.

MOTOR RACING OFF-ROAD AT ANAHEIM;

<P>
STEWART HOLDS OFF EVANS AS TRUCK GETS JOB DONE

<P>
Off-road racer Ivan Stewart will get a new Toyota factory truck to compete in 
Mickey Thompson's Off-Road Championship Gran Prix series in May for the Rose 
Bowl event, but in the meantime, his three-year-old vehicle seems to be holding 
up just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, starting on the front row, overcame pole sitter Danny Thompson on the 
third lap and held off Walker Evans to the finish in winning the grand national 
pickup truck class Saturday night in front of a sellout crowd of 65,477 in 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest crowd to attend an off-road race. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Stewart's first in four years at Anaheim and launched Toyota 
toward its eighth consecutive manufacturers' championship in the stadium racing 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, driving a Jeep, finished second and Stewart's teammate, Jeff Huber was 
third. Thompson, in a Chevrolet, pulled off the course on the second lap with 
smoke bellowing out of his hood. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Gordon, the series' defending champion, crashed into the fence near the 
first-base dugout on the sixth lap. Gordon was making his debut in a Ford 
Ranger after winning the driver's championship last year in a Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
The course featured dual lanes for passing in the middle and was the center of 
controversy and some dangerous driving throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The opening truck heat had three restarts and five drivers flipped their 
vehicles before the eight-lap race could be completed. What's more, two course 
volunteers were nearly hit by driver Rob MacCachren after eight drivers failed 
to observe a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically amateur hour in that race," said Bill Marcel, president of 
the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group. "Everyone had forgotten their driving 
skills. We could have disqualified everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Huber criticized the course, blaming the inability to pass on the narrow lanes 
for the reckless driving in the heat race. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Arciero Jr. won the 1600cc race for his 14th career main-event victory, 
the most ever in the series.

NHL ALL-STAR GAME;

PLAYERS GET TO SHOW OFF THEIR USUAL SKILLS TODAY

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be Wayne vs. Mario. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it has become Bernie vs. Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all the attention centered on the trading Saturday of Bernie 
Nicholls to the New York Rangers by Kings' owner Bruce McNall, they are still 
going to stage an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year, the NHL finally gets back on network television (Channel 4, 
10:30 a.m.) after an absence of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year Pittsburgh Penguin superstar Mario Lemieux hopes to get his 
revenge on resident superstar Wayne Gretzky of the Kings. Gretzky's Campbell 
Conference beat Lemieux's Wales Conference last year, 9-5, in Gretzky's 
long-time home, Edmonton, with the former Oiler winning his second All-Star MVP 
award. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, this is the year the NHL joins its big-league brothers in other 
sports by making the All-Star game a show. It has been moved from its former 
midweek spot to a two-day weekend event, complete with an old-timers' game and 
skills contests on Saturday, just like the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The old-timers began Saturday's events at the Civic Arena in front of 16,236 
fans, the record for a hockey game in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference old-timers beat their Campbell counterparts, 7-1, led by 
Steve Shutt, a former King and Montreal Canadien, and Syl Apps Jr., a former 
New York Ranger, King and Penguin, with two goals each. 
</P>
<P>
In the puck-control relay race, the Campbell team of Gretzky, Kevin Lowe 
(Edmonton), and Doug Smail (Winnipeg) won. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest shot was hit by the Campbell's Al Iafrate (Toronto), clocked at 96 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid-fire competition was won by the Wales, led by Joe Sakic (Quebec), 
Shayne Corson (Montreal) and Kevin Hatcher (Washington), who each connected on 
two shots out of five. 
</P>
<P>
The speed skating event went to Mike Gartner (Minnesota) of the Campbell, who 
hit 28.1 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Accuracy shooting (hitting targets with a puck) went to the Wales, led by Ray 
Bourque (Boston), who hit four of seven.

49ERS MAKE SUPER BOWL WORTHWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has the look of a blowout. And the truth is, it will be a major surprise if 
it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
So is there any point in watching the Super Bowl this year? 
</P>
<P>
There is -- if you're into football in the same sense that music fans, say, 
would jump at the opportunity to catch Bruce Springsteen or the Beatles or 
Frank Sinatra or Count Basie's big band one last time at their absolute peak. 
</P>
<P>
To watch the San Francisco 49ers this winter is to see one of the best football 
teams of all time, playing at levels of efficiency, dedication and excitement 
rarely reached. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that separates the 49ers from others in football isn't their 
exceptional talent, as such -- their individual or collective talent. The thing 
that makes them different is the consistent way their talent performs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have been an aesthetic wonder. 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, their quarterback, Joe Montana, who personifies everything 
the 49ers are. He is quite possibly the best ever, but that's arguable. What 
isn't really arguable is that no other quarterback ever reached and remained at 
the peak that Montana has been at this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that in a 28-team league, the 27 other teams continue to be 
gripped in a parity experience that makes them all seem pretty much alike. 
</P>
<P>
With Montana at his present level, the NFL has divided into what has the look 
of two leagues: the 49ers and all the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Overconfidence is the one thing that could theoretically beat the 49ers in 
their engagement with the Denver Broncos Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
That would be something to consider if they hadn't changed coaches between 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't going to bother them now. 
</P>
<P>
As coached by George Seifert, the 49ers appear to have been driven all season 
by an obsession to show last year's leader, Bill Walsh, they can win without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
And in Super Bowl XXIV, that may inspire them once more. 
</P>
<P>
There is no bitterness or disrespect in the unusual motivation that has kept 
the 49ers going. Some players in former years had some minor differences with 
Walsh -- as gifted, high-strung athletes often have with those in authority -- 
but they don't think of Walsh as a bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, they think of him as a great coach, a silver-haired father 
figure who took them to three Super Bowl championships in eight winters. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Daddy's gone. He can do nothing more, in person, for his big family. 
But the kids have grown up, and, now, they're determined to show the old man 
they don't need him anymore, that they can do it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
That's a powerful motivational weapon. And in a sport one part emotional, one 
part mental and one part physical, the right motivation is often the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Merely wanting to win the Super Bowl isn't enough, though. Every champion wants 
to repeat, but no one has since the Pittsburgh Steelers won in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In a parity era, what's needed is a sufficient reason to do it, and their old 
coach has given it to them. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10 years with the 49ers, Walsh brought in Montana and all the other 
talent, recruited the coaching staff, supervised the structuring of the 
defense, and designed and installed the offense they're still using. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the many who couldn't repeat in the 1980s, he probably couldn't have 
coached a Super Bowl winner himself this year. But by dropping out -- in 
Montana's prime -- Walsh has done the children one last, big favor. 
</P>
<P>
The way they're talking in Denver, they expect quarterback John Elway to win 
this time, ending the Broncos' Super Bowl losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The game's magic number is four: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the 49ers win, their four successes will match Pittsburgh's in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Denver's four losses would match Minnesota's, also in the '70s, when the 
AFC was the dominant conference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A defeat would end Denver's four-game winning streak against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are the only team San Francisco failed to beat in Walsh's 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 regular season, however, NFC playoff teams were a combined 16-4 
against the AFC, which, overall, lost the interconference series, 28-24. 
Illustrating the NFC's present power, a non-playoff NFC team, New Orleans, has 
won 12 in a row against AFC opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Broncos earned the championship of what has become the inferior 
conference, although their coach, Dan Reeves, doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We have played consistently well for 18 games," Reeves said. "So I think we 
have a chance to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Elway does give them a chance. Along with Montana, Houston's Warren Moon and 
Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham, Elway is one of the four great athletes now 
playing quarterback in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But his only reliable running back, Bobby Humphrey, a small but determined 
rookie, cracked two ribs last Sunday -- in a collision that didn't look that 
serious -- and figures to either be out or ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks and kickers can play with cracked ribs. Running backs? No way; not 
well. Not for long. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver people should cool their optimism and get ready to lose. They've had 
a big season. Their manhood doesn't depend on winning the Super Bowl. This is a 
year for them to be content with what Reeves and Elway have already 
accomplished.

FOR RILEY, MILESTONES ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SAM McMANIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley's benchmark victories indicate his development as a coach and the 
formation of a team that achieved unequaled success in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
There were several recurring themes in Riley's first, 50th, 100th, 200th, 
300th, 400th and 450th victories. Magic Johnson was the dominant player, 
averaging 22.2 points, 14.4 assists and 7.2 rebounds in those seven games. 
</P>
<P>
And, Riley usually deflected credit with self-deprecation. 
</P>
<P>
A look at those games: 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 20, 1981 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 136, San Antonio 116 
</P>
<P>
Paul Westhead had been fired the day before, Riley promoted. Jerry West, later 
to become the club's general manager, joined Riley on the bench to help coach. 
Johnson, whose trade request two nights earlier had precipitated Westhead's 
firing in the minds of many observers, was booed by Forum fans. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored 20 points, had 10 rebounds and 16 assists. Mitch Kupchak made 11 
of 12 shots, had 25 points and 17 rebounds. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 30 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wing it, just like me," Riley said when asked if he had given the team 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 50 
</P>
<P>
April 19,1982 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 120, Phoenix 115 
</P>
<P>
It was the last game of the regular season, at Phoenix. The Lakers, still 
adapting to Riley as a coach, finished with a 57-25 record, third best in the 
NBA behind Boston and Philadelphia. Johnson had a triple-double with 15 points, 
15 assists and 12 rebounds. Abdul-Jabbar scored 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the coach provided a quote laden with what later would be dubbed 
Rileyisms: "We're riding a crest of positivism now. Last year, there was a lot 
of negativism surrounding the team at this time." 
</P>
<P>
No. 100 
</P>
<P>
March 22, 1983 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 123, Seattle 108 
</P>
<P>
It took Riley 138 games to reach 100 victories. Only Boston's Red Auerbach, in 
135 games, and the Minneapolis Lakers' John Kundla, in 137, won that many 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists against the SuperSonics, then 
a heated division rival. 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "There was no problem motivating these guys. They felt Seattle was 
making a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 200 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 17, 1985 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 117, Boston 111 
</P>
<P>
It was a customary Laker-Celtic game. Johnson out-dueled Larry Bird at the 
Forum, scoring 37 points to Bird's 33. Celtic Coach K.C. Jones complained about 
the officiating. Riley said the victory "quieted the talk that we can't beat 
the Celtics, not this year. They have been our tormentors." 
</P>
<P>
Riley on reaching the 200-victory milestone: "It feels good to do it against 
the green and white." 
</P>
<P>
No. 300 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 7, 1986 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 132, Golden State 100 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Edes, then covering the Lakers for The Times, wrote that Riley "made a 
stab at humility" afterward. Said Riley: "I don't really pay much attention to 
the numbers, but it's a great honor. I'd say this team has won 150 of them on 
their own, without me." 
</P>
<P>
How many, Riley was asked, do the players think they have won? "About 300," 
Riley replied. No. 400 
</P>
<P>
March 9, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 104, New York 99 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson had scored 26 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and handed out nine 
assists to help give the Laker coach his 400th victory in his 540th game, Riley 
took another stab at humility. 
</P>
<P>
"Even you writers could win 400 games with this team, I think," Riley quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Edes: "To say Riley was responsible for the Lakers' winning, they say, 
would be like crediting the weatherman for a sunny day." 
</P>
<P>
No. 450 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 26, 1989 
</P>
<P>
Lakers 134, Phoenix 122 
</P>
<P>
It was only Game 54 of 82, but Riley told his players it was the most important 
game of the season, because the Lakers were only 1 1/2 games ahead of the Suns 
in the Pacific Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson had scored 25 points and added 19 assists and six rebounds, 
Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said of Riley's comment: "Riley gets that way. 
I'm sure you'll hear that from him again." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "To me, they all are the most important. I think (the players) know 
that." SAM McMANIS

LAKERS DON'T WANT TO BE BEHIND EIGHT BALL AGAINST PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers have abandoned all pretense of nonchalance this time. No longer do 
they consider their twice-seasonal meetings with the Detroit Pistons as being 
of moderate importance in the whole scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
No, today's nationally televised game means much to the Lakers on at least two 
levels. Redemption from the Pistons' sweep in last spring's NBA finals, for 
one. And, more important to Coach Pat Riley, a Laker victory would land a blow 
in any psychological warfare the teams will wage should they meet for a third 
consecutive time in the finals this June. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, the Lakers have not beaten the Pistons in seven consecutive 
games. They lost both regular-season games last season, were swept by the 
Pistons in the finals and lost, 108-97, in overtime Dec. 1 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"That's seven straight losses," Riley said. "They do have the psychological 
advantage in that way. We have to plant our feet, stand firm and make a 
statement. I know I've said that before, but it's time for us to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Some might want to put a qualifier on the Pistons' seven-game winning streak 
over the Lakers. The Lakers lost guard Byron Scott to a hamstring injury for 
all four games of the finals, Magic Johnson for the last 2 1/2. Johnson also 
missed one of the two regular-season games with Detroit last season. And, this 
season, the Lakers were without Orlando Woolridge, now the club's fifth-leading 
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"You can throw all that out," Riley said. "It doesn't matter. What we have to 
do is learn how to play a whole game against them." 
</P>
<P>
In the Dec. 1 loss, the Lakers had a lead late in the fourth quarter before 
going the final eight minutes without scoring a field goal. In fact, the Lakers 
were held without a point in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players find it pointless to dwell on that particular loss, but they are 
motivated for today's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do things against them we haven't done in the past, like play 
hard to the end," Johnson said. "We're looking forward to it. You always circle 
this game on your calendar." 
</P>
<P>
Center Mychal Thompson said his teammates are aware that the Lakers are 0-7 
against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as much incentive as we need," Thompson said. "We're tired of losing to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In order for the Lakers to break the Pistons' domination, Riley said they have 
to play strong the entire game instead of fading in the fourth quarter under 
the Pistons' relentless defensive pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Their guards, we always have trouble matching up with them," Riley said. "And 
(Dennis) Rodman always does a good job either on (James) Worthy or Earvin. But 
we've got to play a full game. Their style of play never allows them to get out 
of a game. If (the defense) gets them to the fourth period, they find a way to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
On the road, lately, the Lakers have found ways to lose leads. They carry a 
three-game road losing streak into today's game. They dropped a two-point 
decision at Golden State on Jan. 6; a three-point decision at Phoenix on Jan. 9 
and fell behind by 24 points Friday night at Milwaukee before losing by one 
point when Thompson missed a last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, however, say they have expunged those losses from memory. But they 
have not forgotten what the Pistons have done to them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like it was with Boston for a while, where people said we could 
not beat them," Riley said. "We need a win to break through that."

VALLEY COLLEGE PROFITS AT THE FREE-THROW LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its 107-101 Western State Conference victory over visiting Ventura on 
Saturday night, Valley College might as well have pitched a tent at the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs went there 44 times, converting 32 shots, to remain undefeated in 
the WSC with a 6-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura fell to 4-2 in the WSC and 17-8 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (15-8), which forced 26 Ventura turnovers, led comfortably at halftime, 
60-43, and built a 92-67 advantage with 6 minutes, 31 seconds to play. But the 
Monarchs, who didn't score a basket the final eight minutes, couldn't stand the 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, led by center Lester Neal (25 points and 12 rebounds) and forward Leo 
Parker (16 points), went on a 25-4 run to cut Valley's lead to 96-92 with 1:50 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs committed 13 second-half turnovers, most of them during Ventura's 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which had 11 less field goals than Ventura in the second half, shot 18 
free throws in the final 4:42, converting 14 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Eric McDaniels was six of seven from the line down the stretch 
for Valley, Rick Garrick was two of two, Shawn DeLaittre was three of four, and 
Andre Harrell, who scored a game-high 28 points, was three of five. 
</P>
<P>
"Their pressure got to us," said DeLaittre, who finished with 22 points, eight 
rebounds and a cut lip courtesy of an errant Pirate elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember back when I played at Simi Valley High, we blew a 25-point lead 
against Bishop Gorman and they beat us. That was going through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Harrell scored 17 points in the first half when Valley went on a 26-11 run over 
the final eight minutes to break open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ward came off the bench for 12 first-half points for the Monarchs but 
played little in the second half as Coach Jim Stephens chose to keep him on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton Boykin (14 points) and Garrick (10, all in the second half) also scored 
in double figures for Valley, and Cliff Barnes added 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence Lamb and Chris Hantgin had 16 and 15 points for Ventura.

CSUN MAKES CHAPMAN ITS 5TH VICTIM IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fourth time in as many games, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball 
team shot better than 50% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was the Matadors' defense that deserved much of the credit for a 77-58 
win over Chapman in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at The Hutton 
Sports Center in the city of Orange on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive win for Northridge (9-8, 4-0 in conference play), 
sixth in its past seven games, and kept the Matadors alone atop the CCAA 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers scored a team-high 19 points for Northridge, Bill Mazurie had 
13 and Jemarl Baker added 11. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge hit 32 of 54 shots (59.3%) after a 30-of-52 performance against 
Dominguez Hills on Friday, but it was the Matadors' defense that held Roger 
Middleton, the conference's leading scorer with a 23-point average, to eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to neutralize him this time around," Gathers said. "Last year 
he just killed us. He had something like seven dunks against us in the second 
game, so this was pay-back time." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that Middleton was a high-percentage shooter, the Matadors' defensive 
strategy was to deny him the ball, which they did, limiting the 6-foot-4, 
225-pound junior to one field-goal attempt (which he made). 
</P>
<P>
Every time Middleton touched the ball, the Matadors' 3-2 zone defense would 
collapse on him, forcing him to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us some problems in the first half," Gathers said. "But we made some 
adjustments at halftime and corrected our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 41-33, at halftime, Northridge went on an 18-4 run to start the second 
half and put the game away. Northridge hit 12 of its first 20 shots in the 
second half and took its biggest lead of the game, 69-47, with 5:53 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Reyes scored a game-high 20 points for Chapman (9-8, 1-3), which beat 
Northridge twice last year. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting 16 of 22 shots in the second half against Dominguez Hills, 
Northridge made 17 of 25 shots (68%) in the first 20-minute period against 
Chapman to take a 41-33 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 25-23, with seven minutes left in the half, the Matadors went on a 
16-10 run, hitting their final eight shots. Mazurie and Sandy Brown each had 
six points during the stretch and Baker's driving shot in the lane with a 
second left capped the run. 
</P>
<P>
Mazurie had a team-high 10 points at intermission and Brown added six as the 
Northridge bench accounted for 22 of 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton scored seven points, but in a preview of things to come, the 
Northridge defense limited him to the lone field goal.

A PARTING OF WAYS ;

ALTHOUGH CANOGA PARK'S JEFF DAVIS REMAINS FRIENDS WITH MIKE MCNULTY, HIS 
COACHING METHODS RANKLE HIS MENTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canoga Park High point guard Lindsey Dunbar, all 5-foot-7 of him, cradled the 
ball in both hands, rocking it back and forth as he stood at the top of the 
key. His pivot foot glued to the ground, Dunbar yelled for a teammate's 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Screen, right here," Dunbar yelped, motioning to the right of Cleveland guard 
Kenny Collins, whose chest-in-your-face defense was beginning to rub the hair 
from Dunbar's eyebrows. "Right here." 
</P>
<P>
Collins fell for the verbal fake and took a quick glance over his right 
shoulder. Nobody there. 
</P>
<P>
And guess what? When Collins turned back around, there was nobody there, 
either. Dunbar was on his way to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that they mirror me, that there's a lot of me in them," said 
Jeff Davis, Canoga Park's first-year coach and a relative tower at 5-8. 
"They're not very big. If they don't hustle and play scrappy, we're never gonna 
win." 
</P>
<P>
For the past several seasons, Canoga Park has had trouble juking anybody. Under 
the guidance of Davis, however, the Hunters (8-11) already have won twice as 
many games as they have over the past two seasons combined (four). One of those 
victories, it should be noted, came over the Hamilton junior varsity in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there's anything wrong with JV teams, which is what Davis spent the 
past few years coaching at West Valley League rival El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Canoga Park will play host to El Camino Real (6-8) at 4 p.m. It 
is a game that pits Davis against his longtime mentor, Conquistadore Coach Mike 
McNulty. One might expect a reunion of two men who spent the past seven seasons 
sitting next to one another on the same bench to be an upbeat, spirited affair. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be many secrets," McNulty said. "He knows all of our guys and I'm 
sure some of what he's running will look familiar to us." 
</P>
<P>
The transfer last spring of talented guard Marcus Reed from El Camino Real to 
Canoga Park, however, has chilled the friendship -- to the point that McNulty 
recently termed the relationship as "tense." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Canoga Park team resembles the fast-talking Davis a little too 
much. Is the first-year coach a tad too slick, a bit too wily? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, McNulty thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be selling used cars," McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Dunbar's trickery got him past Collins, but a half-second later, Dunbar 
was called for charging. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was still a runny-nosed kid in junior high when he first saw McNulty 
wheel and deal in the El Camino High gymnasium in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
You might have seen the game, too. It was televised on KNBC on a 
long-since-canceled program called "Prep Sportsworld," which featured a high 
school game of the week from the Los Angeles area. The broadcasters for the 
Taft-El Camino Real tilt were Tommy Hawkins and Ross Porter. 
</P>
<P>
"(McNulty) was the star guard," said Davis, who was starry-eyed, indeed. "After 
that I went to every game. He was kind of my idol. At that time, I hadn't 
really seen any pro or college games on TV, so he was it." 
</P>
<P>
The 1971-72 team remains one of the best in school history. It finished West 
Valley League play 10-0 and was 17-2 overall. In the 18 seasons since, no El 
Camino Real team has won more games. 
</P>
<P>
"McNulty was a god," said Jim Coleman, a guard and 1972 alumnus. "He had a 
group of people who followed him around school, people who'd known him since he 
came over from Hale (Junior High). To them, he was the man." 
</P>
<P>
McNulty, 36, graduated in 1972 but soon returned to serve as a volunteer 
assistant with the El Camino Real junior varsity. By then, Davis was a 
sophomore guard in search of whatever assistance he could find, and McNulty -- 
who would become the Conquistadores' varsity coach in 1982 -- was the targeted 
tutor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he remembers this, but, after practice, he'd take time out for 
about a half-hour every day and work on my shooting," said Davis, 29, a 1978 
alumnus. "He'd pass the ball around the perimeter, make me work on my balance 
and my footwork, just keep shooting the ball out to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dying, I was exhausted. But he kept me out there -- he said it would be 
good for me." 
</P>
<P>
McNulty, Davis freely admits, continued to be a good influence. Last spring, 
after completing his seventh season as McNulty's junior varsity coach and 
varsity assistant, Davis took over the struggling program at Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about 80% of the things I know about basketball from him," said 
Davis, who on occasion, still refers to his former associate as Coach McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at him like a big brother, I look at him like a teacher, I look at him 
like a coach I played for, because I did," Davis said. "I look at Mac from all 
these different perspectives. I remember being 12 years old and sneaking into 
the gym to watch him play -- I never paid -- and I remember thinking, 'Boy, 
that guy's so smart.' He was like Bob Cousy." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was more like Ernie DiGregorio. A backup guard, he had to bust his rear 
to make up for a lack of physical ability. After joining the El Camino Real 
coaching staff in 1981-82, the gregarious and opinionated Davis fast became one 
of the Valley's most identifiable assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exact opposites as personalities," Davis said of McNulty. "He's real 
calm and reserved. His teams mirror him, my teams mirror me." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe reflection is what this is all about. 
</P>
<P>
In McNulty's book of synonyms, loyalty, discipline and basketball mean 
virtually the same darn thing. Four seasons ago, a gifted former player -- a 
sure starter who had transferred to talent-rich Crenshaw before his junior 
season -- approached McNulty during a UCLA game at Pauley Pavilion and asked if 
he could transfer back to El Camino Real for his senior year. It turns out the 
kid spent his junior campaign buried on the Crenshaw bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Mac looked the kid right in the eye and said, 'First of all, I'm not your 
coach and you don't go to my school, so you shouldn't be talking to me,' " 
recalled Davis, who attended the game with McNulty. "Then he says, 'And second, 
I never take anybody back.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's how by the book Mac is." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson? Don't knife the Mac. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty hasn't changed much. Before last Thursday's practice, McNulty chewed on 
one player's ear for wearing non-regulation shorts underneath his practice 
garb. He then ordered another to remove a T-shirt he was wearing under his 
practice jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, McNulty had a falling out with junior guard Todd Orlando -- one of 
the team's lone scoring threats from the perimeter -- and booted him from the 
team. He refused to reinstate Orlando even after the player apologized and his 
parents intervened, asking the coach for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it might come back to hurt us, and it did," McNulty said with a 
shrug, referring to his team's loss to Fremont in the City Section 3-A Division 
semifinals last season. "We could have won that game with Todd." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando is back for his senior year, but McNulty insisted that Orlando's grades 
in deportment were superlative, or else. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect more from my guys," said McNulty, a walk-on coach. "I do whatever it 
takes to help them, and I expect the same in return." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, a breech of loyalty, McNulty feels, is what sparked the rift 
with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Reed, a senior guard who is averaging 19.9 points and seven assists a 
game at Canoga Park, attended El Camino Real last year and played for Davis on 
the junior varsity. Reed disappeared a year ago during the spring-league 
season, McNulty said, without a word of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Reed turned up at Canoga Park -- where he was enrolled as a freshman and 
sophomore -- and is the Hunters' best player. McNulty says Reed was a projected 
starter at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Davis says Reed's father, John, had a falling out with El Camino Real 
administrators and that Marcus transferred to Canoga Park long before the 
basketball coaching position was available. John Reed approached McNulty at the 
Taft-San Fernando game last Wednesday and reiterated that the transfer had 
nothing to do with McNulty or the team. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, however, McNulty has trouble buying Reed's rationale or Davis' 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"He started on the varsity in the spring league," McNulty said. "All of a 
sudden Marcus didn't come out. I sent the word out that I wanted to talk to 
him, but I haven't spoken (to) or even seen that kid since the day he left 
here. I get a version through the kids and I get a version through Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not right that he gets to go and play against us (at a league rival). 
It's just the principle." 
</P>
<P>
But it may transcend a mere bending of propriety, McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was unhappy at Canoga the first time, why go back a second time?" he 
said. "There are several things that just don't fit." 
</P>
<P>
Davis insists that the transfer was entirely aboveboard. "Anyone who thinks I 
recruited Marcus Reed, that's the farthest thing from the truth," he said. "He 
was leaving El Camino before I even had the job. This is his original school in 
his original neighborhood, all of his friends are here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous statement." 
</P>
<P>
McNulty's concern, Davis said, should instead be directed toward City Section 
policy, which at times seems to allow players to leap-frog from school to 
school, irrespective of attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Transferring back to his old school isn't against City rules," Davis said. 
"It's part of the standing joke in the City: You don't know who you have until 
the first day of school." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he thought McNulty was satisfied with his explanation of the Reed 
transfer; McNulty says that he merely decided -- after City administrators 
ruled in favor of the transfer -- that it was pointless to pursue the matter 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Jeff flat-out what happened, he gave me his answer and it doesn't come 
close to what I had heard," McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Davis: "Kids transfer all the time. Bert Mitchell (now at El Camino 
Real) started at Dorsey, then transferred to El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Canoga team. This is not a bought team, this is not a found team." 
</P>
<P>
The first-year coach found success by assembling a group of players who, in 
stature, could pass for one of his old junior varsity teams. Most of the 13 
players on the roster, Davis says, were ineligible last season. Three are 
transfers; Dunbar from Fremont, center-forward Shawn Lewis is from Chicago and 
Reed, well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters have lost all five of their games in Northwest Valley Conference 
play, but the losing margin in nearly every instance has been halved from last 
season. In 1989, Canoga Park lost to Cleveland by 97 points. Last Wednesday, 
the Cavaliers won, 84-65. 
</P>
<P>
If Davis can just keep the local kids from leaving, the outlook should continue 
to improve. Among the players who left or never enrolled at Canoga Park after 
attending junior high in the area are Brandon Battle (a senior at Cleveland) 
and Cleveland Jackson (a 6-6 senior All-American at St. Monica). Danny Griffin, 
who last season received a scholarship offer from Pitt after transferring to 
and graduating from Crenshaw, attended Columbus Junior High in Canoga Park, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons they left? Rather obvious. For example, El Camino Real last lost to 
Canoga Park during the 1981-82 season, a game in which the Hunters snapped a 
34-game losing streak. Not much tradition there. 
</P>
<P>
The first-year coach knows that if he hustles, he can keep the home boys at 
home -- Davis has a pair of 6-2 freshmen that he definitely plans to keep his 
eye on. But this may be a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
Davis suspects that to McNulty, he will always be that pesky little guard from 
the late '70s, the youngster who sometimes talks too much, lets players get 
away with an indiscretion or two, steps on an occasional toe, is a bit too 
gung-ho. 
</P>
<P>
"If (McNulty) could see me at practice now, he'd see that I've changed," said 
Davis, who has sought input from walk-on assistants such as Harry Daye, the 
father of former Kennedy High and UCLA star Darren Daye. "Assistants are always 
the ones who get to know the kids, and I think that scared him. The assistants 
handle all the positive reinforcement, while the coach handles the negative 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I have guys who handle that for me, and I have to handle the discipline, 
the strategy and all that. I'm a lot different . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, now I feel like I have 100% more respect for him than he does for 
me. I guess he forgot about all the summer-league seasons I spent with the 
team, how I was the on-campus coach . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The two remain on sociable terms. Each Friday, McNulty and Davis join Taft 
Coach Jim Woodard and Kennedy Coach Yutaka Shimizu at a local restaurant to 
rehash the week's games and shoot the breeze. "That's our fun night, we stay up 
until one in the morning or so," McNulty said. "It's fun to get into their 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
Where do they stand? McNulty sounds like a father whose son just scratched the 
family car -- and blamed it on the other driver. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say he's like a son, because we're so different in our approaches," 
McNulty said. "Maybe it's just our personalities, I don't know. We're still 
friends."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: MONTCLAIR PREP COULD END DOUBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We interrupt basketball season to bring you an update on Valley football, 
1990-style. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Montclair Prep? That tiny school in Van Nuys dripping with talent? The 
school of which everybody had an opinion? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly you heard of the backfield of dreams, with juniors Derek and Leland 
Sparks and senior Michael Jones. You heard of the behemoth linemen, such as 
Donovan Roy and Jason Blatt. You saw their blowouts against outmanned 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you were among those who questioned the validity of the Mounties' 12-1 
season, which ended just one game shy of a Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
You heard the rumblings. Montclair Prep . . . who did they ever play? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if things work out as planned, the mighty Mounties will have a chance to 
thumb their noses at all doubters and prove something in the process. There is 
a chance that Montclair Prep can play a preseason nonleague game against 
Chaminade, a member of the newly created Mission League (along with Alemany, 
Crespi, Notre Dame, St. Paul, Bishop Montgomery and St. Bernard). Chaminade has 
a well-respected program, the kind that lends credibility to an opponent's 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles and the Mounties share an open date on Sept. 21, 1990. Chaminade 
Coach Rich Lawson has approached Montclair Prep coaches George Giannini and 
John Hazelton about a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I mentioned that it would be kind of nice for both schools," Lawson said. "The 
kids know each other, so what the heck? I think it would be a good game and I 
would enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just up to the athletic directors now. They're the ones carrying 
the ball right now." 
</P>
<P>
Add big game: Montclair Prep already has taken steps to add weight to its 
schedule by participating in a preseason game in Hawaii as part of a national 
triple-header that also includes Crespi and Canyon. But a game against a 
recognized local power likely would mean more to Montclair Prep -- and draw 
much fan interest. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson points out that, because of his team's affiliation with a new league and 
its attendant prestige, the Mounties would benefit greatly from a win. Probably 
more so than Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be a real big shot in the arm for their program if they win," Lawson 
said. "Heck, we stand to lose more than they do. But why not? I'd like to play 
as many schools in the San Fernando Valley as possible." 
</P>
<P>
And how does Montclair Prep feel about all this? 
</P>
<P>
Said Hazelton: "It'd finally be a chance to answer our critics." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Lawson, on Chaminade's jump from Division VII to Division I in one 
season: "For the other programs, it's not that big a deal. But it's one giant 
step for the little Eagles." 
</P>
<P>
It's fair to say, then, that the Eagles have landed. 
</P>
<P>
Royal confusion: John Reed, wrestling coach at Royal High, says that a 
misunderstanding led to his dismissal two weeks ago as freshman football coach. 
In an interview regarding wrestling, Reed said he was disappointed to see that 
in California there is little connection between a school's football and 
wrestling programs. In Oklahoma, many football players have wrestled, said 
Reed, who attended school there. To him, it appeared that this helped the 
football players greatly with agility and from a mental approach. 
</P>
<P>
Reed told the reporter that if he were a head football coach, he would 
encourage his players to wrestle. 
</P>
<P>
When the quote was published, it read as if Reed had said that if he were the 
football coach, he would encourage same. 
</P>
<P>
Royal varsity Coach Gene Uebelhardt took exception to what he perceived as 
unnecessary advice regarding his program and fired Reed as freshman football 
coach. Reed is still confused and saddened over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it was an innocuous statement," Reed said. "I don't see the 
harm. It was never something that was meant to put a blame on anyone or 
anything like that. I told Gene, 'I wasn't pointing a finger at you. I was just 
making a statement about football and wrestling.' And I will stand by that 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something I want to make enemies on." 
</P>
<P>
Uebelhardt, however, failed to see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no comment," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, the subject is closed."

DIGEST: FOOTBALL PUBLICATION HONORS CRESPI'S WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Football magazine has named former Crespi High running back Russell 
White its high school offensive player of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
White, the state's all-time leading rusher with 5,998 yards and 94 touchdowns, 
will be a sophomore at Cal this fall. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of seven Valley-area athletes honored in the magazine's latest 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bregel, an offensive guard at Kennedy who competed at USC and for the San 
Francisco 49ers in the National Football League, was named to the all-decade 
team along with White. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's defensive team included former Antelope Valley standout Tommie 
Smith at safety and Randy Austin of Canyon at inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's Errol Small, Canyon's Clint Beauer and Reseda's Jason Keiderling 
were honored for their performances this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Small, a running back, was named to the first-team offense. Beauer, who tied 
for seventh in the state with 62 receptions and had a state-best 16.6 yards per 
catch, was a second-team receiver and Keiderling, a 6-foot-5, 265-pound 
lineman, was also on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Fick, 34, a catcher with the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional 
Baseball Assn., has accepted a part-time job as a scout with the Cincinnati 
Reds. His area of responsibility includes the Valley, UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Fick, a Newbury Park resident, was an assistant baseball coach at Thousand Oaks 
High the past three years. He is batting .281 for the Legends. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Skeels, a former Thousand Oaks High standout, was traded to the New York 
Yankees organization from the San Diego Padres for a minor-league infielder. 
Skeels, who played for Riverside of the Class A California League last season, 
set a University of Arkansas single-season record in 1987 with 18 home runs.

OCCIDENTAL BEATEN IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Occidental College inducted three people into its basketball hall of fame 
at halftime Saturday night, Chris Anderson gave the crowd a glimpse of a 
possible future member by finishing with 30 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-foot-9 1/2 senior center's performance wasn't enough as Occidental 
fell, 80-77, in overtime to La Verne, one of its rivals in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"(Anderson) is a super player," La Verne Coach Gary Stewart said. "There is no 
way we could stop him. We could only try to contain him as best we could." 
</P>
<P>
La Verne (13-4, 3-1) built a 76-72 lead with 3 minutes, 17 seconds remaining in 
overtime, but Occidental closed to 77-75 when Ethan Caldwell was fouled while 
making a five-foot hook shot 13 seconds later. He sank the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Loomis hit a free throw to put La Verne ahead, 78-75, with 2:11 left, but 
Anderson hit a 19-foot baseline jump shot with 50 seconds remaining to slice 
the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental had a chance to win the game with seven seconds to play, but DeShang 
Weaver intercepted a pass by Anderson and scored on an uncontested dunk. 
Caldwell's desperation shot from halfcourt fell short as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 70-70, with 34 seconds remaining in regulation, Occidental 
played for the last shot. Caldwell drove up the middle, but his shot bounced 
off the left side of the rim and the game went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a hard season," said Occidental Coach Brian Newhall, whose Tigers 
lost in the closing seconds to Whittier last week. "We can't seem to put games 
away in the final four minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver gave La Verne a 70-68 advantage with 1:37 to play on a two-handed dunk 
off a back-door pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers tied the score on Phil Engebretsen's reverse layup with 51 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental fell behind by 11 points, 49-38, early in the first half. But the 
Tigers went ahead for the first time, 65-64, when Anderson tipped in his missed 
shot with 3:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Manning and Weaver led La Verne with 21 and 20 points and Caldwell added 
15 for Occidental (5-11, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
La Verne led at the half, 40-33, and was ahead by nine points twice in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
With Occidental trailing, 40-31, with less than a minute to play in the opening 
half, Anderson cut the deficit to seven with a one-handed jam off a baseline 
drive then blocked a last-second jump shot by Loomis. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson established the inside game early for Occidental, scoring 12 of the 
Tigers' first 14 points and 18 in the first half, mostly on short jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental opened a 16-13 advantage midway through the half, but La Verne went 
on a 13-2 run over the next five minutes to take a 26-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Bertz cut the deficit to four on a 15-foot jump shot, 33-29, at the 
2:56 mark. However, Manning squelched the Occidental rally, scoring five 
unanswered points.

FIGHT HALTS PALMDALE-ANTELOPE VALLEY MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Golden League soccer match between Palmdale High and host Antelope Valley was 
suspended Friday night with 10 minutes remaining when a fight erupted between 
Palmdale's Robert Rossil and Antelope Valley's Pablo Hernandez, according to 
Palmdale Coach Juan Paolo. 
</P>
<P>
Paolo and game and school officials will view videotapes of the match today to 
determine who was at fault in the altercation, the second this school year 
involving a Palmdale team. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, a football game between Palmdale and Saugus was stopped midway 
through the fourth quarter when Palmdale safety Darius Wilson attacked a game 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley led, 2-1, Friday before referee Carlos Cerda ordered the match 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Cerda declared the match "no contest," Paolo said, and the records of Antelope 
Valley (4-1-1, 2-1-1 in league play) and Palmdale (2-4-7, 1-1-2) remained 
unchanged.

After struggling to a 3-12 record in nonconference play, the Cal State 
Northridge women's basketball team won its third consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. game with a 72-68 victory over Chapman on Saturday 
night at Chapman. The win was the Lady Matadors' fourth in the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
The win kept Northridge (6-12, 3-0 in conference play) in a first-place tie 
with Cal Poly Pomona, the eight-time defending CCAA champion and the Lady 
Matadors' next opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was led by forwards Denna Mulverhill and Julie Arlotto. 
</P>
<P>
Mulverhill had 16 points on eight-of-13 shooting and nine rebounds. Arlotto 
added 15 points and five rebounds. 
</P>

The Lady Matadors shot 51.9% (28 of 54) from the field and outrebounded 
Chapman, 32-28. 
</P>

ARTS: THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC CORPORATION FOR THE ARTS IS LOOKING FOR 
MORE WAYS TO INCLUDE BLACK, LATINO AND ASIAN CULTURES IN THE GROWING LONG BEACH 
ART SCENE. 
</P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandra L. Gibson, who became executive director of the Public Corporation for 
the Arts earlier this month, plans to include minorities in a field of activity 
that in this city has been traditionally dominated by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people out there doing wonderful work that is unknown," said Gibson, 
34, whose background includes traces of all three of the city's major ethnic 
minorities: black, Latino and Southeast Asian. "We need to find a vehicle for 
these cultures." 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle may be the nonprofit agency she heads. It is charged by the city 
with promoting the arts in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect her to set the direction," said Bernard Landes, president of the 
agency's 21-member board of directors appointed by the mayor. While Gibson is 
answerable to the board, Landes said, the body traditionally gives wide 
latitude to its executive director in determining policy. 
</P>
<P>
Promoting the artistic endeavors of ethnic minorities is not a new idea in 
town. The PCA's own list of grants awarded to local artists and arts 
organizations this year includes the Cambodian Art Preservation Group, Khmer 
Women Weavers, a black group called the Wajeehah Theatrical Ensemble, a 
musician who wants to organize a multicultural performing ensemble, a group 
providing workshops for American Indian youths to create books about their 
tribal heritage and a photographer putting together a series of black and white 
photographs of black ministers in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson wants to expand the annual Long Beach Art Expedition, a one-day tour of 
artists' studios, to a weekend and include a wider range of art activities, 
some of them ethnic. Another possibility, she said, is to create a second arts 
festival in the Anaheim Street corridor, which straddles the city's central 
area, in which most of its minorities reside. 
</P>
<P>
Landes says the board has its own goals. Among them, he said, is the 
improvement of the International City Festival, an annual three-day 
extravaganza highlighting ethnic foods, products and entertainment. 
Specifically, he said, the board would like to reorganize the event to focus 
more on "quality" rather than "commercial" crafts. 
</P>
<P>
With the new "percent for art" program this year, he said, the PCA may have the 
money to do that and more. 
</P>
<P>
Enacted largely at the agency's behest, the policy requires downtown developers 
to set aside 1% of their construction budgets for art, a requirement that could 
generate hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next 10 years. About 80% of 
the money, Landes said, will be used for public art projects approved by an 
as-yet unnamed seven-member advisory committee. The rest, he said, will go 
directly to the PCA to use as it sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
As director, Gibson will be in a position to exert a major influence on how the 
money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Money, in fact, was a major factor in the success of her predecessor, Lindsay 
Shields, who left the post in August to become assistant to the president of 
the California Institute for the Arts in Valencia. In five years, Shields 
guided the PCA from an agency with a $143,000-a-year budget to an organization 
with an annual budget of $940,000 and an increase of nearly 400% in the number 
of its programs. During the same period, the city's contribution rose from 
$150,000 a year to $637,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said she plans to follow Shields' lead by continuing to expand the 
organization's financial base, which, in addition to the city's contribution, 
consists of state and federal grants, as well as corporate donations. One of 
her most immediate goals, she said, is to renew a three-year $150,000 National 
Endowment for the Arts allotment, matched by the city, which expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have worked with her in the past say that Gibson has a management 
style well-suited to leading an umbrella-type organization like the PCA, in 
which diplomacy and persuasion often work better than the simple exercise of 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"She's kind of like the Pied Piper," said Patrisse Dawson, administrator for 
campus personnel and employee benefits at the American Film Institute in Los 
Angeles, where Gibson was her supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning as administrator of campus operations and personnel, Gibson -- who 
has a master's degree from Northwestern University in historical musicology and 
performance -- advanced in four years to director of operations for the 
institute's Center for Advanced Film and Television Studies. "She takes 
charge," Dawson said, "but she allows for your input. She lends to your 
creativity, as well as gives you direction." 
</P>
<P>
Back at the PCA headquarters on the bottom floor of the Long Beach Convention 
and Entertainment Center, meanwhile, the new director is still in the process 
of putting art on the bare walls of her tiny new office, meeting the local 
dignitaries with whom she will work and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses 
of the staff she inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is at a crossroads," she said. "Long Beach is about to be given the 
recognition it deserves and I want the arts to be part of it."

TAX PROPOSAL TO BOOST POLICE NEARING VOTE IN LONG BEACH 
</P>

<P>
The path to the ballot box has proven a surprisingly long and tortuous one for 
what would seem to be an apple pie sort of issue in this crime-bruised city -- 
a proposal to hire more police officers with money raised through a new 
property tax levy. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year and half after the matter was first broached, the City Council 
seems poised to put the police tax on the ballot for a citywide vote this year. 
The levy -- amounting to about $44 a year for the typical single family home -- 
would raise $7.3 million annually to pay for another 75 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more police. We need 'em quick," Councilman Warren Harwood said. 
</P>
<P>
One would never know it by the pace of City Council deliberations. Over the 
past 18 months, the council has obtained a consultant's report on police 
staffing, held hearings on the matter, debated it, sent it to committee and 
tabled it. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been complicated by bad publicity for the 677-member police force 
over a brutality incident, fractious labor negotiations with the police union 
and a report that concluded the department didn't need more police as much as 
it needed to change its staffing practices. 
</P>
<P>
A scenario of the police proposal, said Councilman Ray Grabinski, would amount 
to "a very strange mural. You'd see this issue which everybody supports -- more 
cops -- with mines (everywhere)." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those mines remained on the horizon last week when a council committee 
voted to send the police proposal back to the full council for a vote -- 
possibly this week -- on whether to put the measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If the city's contract dispute with the police union remains unsettled, it is 
even possible that the union could find itself in the ironic position of 
lobbying against the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any way you can separate the contract dispute from the 
ballot item," Mike Tracy, president of the police union, said last week. "We 
would never argue against more police officers," Tracy continued, "but we would 
argue there are more efficient ways to get what they want" than imposing a new 
levy on property taxes. "There is another way that is more cost effective." 
</P>
<P>
That way is outlined in one of the union's contract proposals, a "constant 
manning" clause that would have each member of the force work one extra shift a 
month at a cost of $1.8 million. Tracy said that would immediately put 21 more 
officers on the streets every day. 
</P>
<P>
The union and the city are scheduled back in court Monday, when a Superior 
Court judge is expected to rule on whether the council was acting legally when 
it declared an impasse in the contract negotiations last November and voted to 
impose the city's last contract offer without the union's consent. Tracy said 
he was still hoping for a peaceful settlement, but reiterated that the union 
would not docilely accept any contract unilaterally imposed by management. 
</P>
<P>
The city has used the contract talks to try to carry out several staffing 
recommendations contained in a report prepared last year by Ralph Andersen 
&amp; Associates. The study concluded that if the department eliminated the 
practice of staffing all night-shift patrol cars with two officers and sent out 
more cars with just one officer, the force would be able to handle its workload 
with current staffing, or at the most, another 48 officers. 
</P>
<P>
The union, condemning the report as the biased product of management's wishes, 
has bitterly fought to retain two-officer cars and other personnel practices 
criticized in the Andersen study. 
</P>
<P>
To what extent the city gets its way will influence the number of new officers 
needed for the force. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that bothers me is that we have to move right now without 
having all the questions answered," said Councilman Les Robbins, nevertheless 
adding that he supports putting the measure on the June ballot and expects the 
council to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's been political pressure by newspapers and people are up for 
reelection. I think it's going to go without any question because of that." 
</P>
<P>
A soaring crime rate and chronic complaints of poor police service promise to 
make crime a leading campaign issue in this spring's council elections. As 
political observers have noted, putting the police proposal on the ballot would 
allow incumbents to say they're doing something about crime. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, there was also an effort to put the proposal off until the 
November elections to avoid placing the item on the same June ballot that will 
likely be asking voters to double the salaries of City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
The levy, which must pass by a two-thirds public vote, would be paid primarily 
by residential property owners, since they make the greatest demands on police 
service. Depending on the size of their houses, single-family homeowners would 
pay anywhere from $34 to $64 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Just how many additional officers the department needs is a matter of debate. 
Police officials, aiming for a ratio of two officers for every 1,000 residents, 
say they could use another 164 officers. Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, a 
vocal community group, has gone on record as supporting the 48 extra officers 
mentioned in the Andersen report. 
</P>
<P>
And while members of the city's Public Safety Advisory Commission say they will 
campaign vigorously for a ballot item for 75 officers, they have also supported 
the police chief's request for 164 more officers. 
</P>
<P>
The number 75, agreed to by the council and city management, is a compromise 
figure. Ask for more than that, council members worry, and the levy will be too 
large for voters to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the argument is, we need more, 75 is a number," commented one council 
member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to create a property levy to pay for more police will return to 
the City Council Tuesday. If the council approves the measure, a public hearing 
date would be set, the council would take a final vote and the proposal would 
be placed on the June 5 ballot for a citywide vote. To pass, the levy would 
have to be approved by two-thirds of those casting ballots.

DOWNEY ACTS TO SAVE ITS PAST; 
</P>
<P>
CITY TAKES EMERGENCY STEPS TO SPARE 23 THREATENED HISTORIC HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
The city has taken emergency measures to save at least 23 historic homes 
threatened by new development and soaring land values. 
</P>
<P>
It has declared a moratorium on the demolition of historic residences that were 
built before 1939 and are on property that can be subdivided. The city's 
endangered list includes Victorian, Mediterranean, California cottage and 
bungalow, and English country-style houses. 
</P>
<P>
The homes chosen for preservation are sound structures, requiring no major 
alterations, according to Ken Farsing, director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has received no requests for permits to destroy these 
properties to build new housing, Farsing said the city still is concerned with 
protecting historic residences. Once these buildings are demolished, the 
architectural and cultural benefits cannot be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, several historic homes have been destroyed and replaced with 
modern housing, Planning Commissioner Joyce Lawrence said. She is former 
president of the Downey Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
The Barnes house, a California redwood cottage built in the 1880s, the Kenney 
house, a Victorian-style home built in the 1890s, and the Willeford house, a 
hollow-tile structure built in 1919, were all torn down to make room for new 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The smaller homes, such as the bungalows and cottages, are most threatened 
because they don't stick out or are as intriguing as the others," Lawrence 
said. "People drive by and think they're expendable, and don't give them the 
preference they give the larger homes. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a place, too, in the representation of our earlier era," she said 
"That was what was in." 
</P>
<P>
Farsing said the moratorium will provide the city with time to study historic 
preservation and to develop general guidelines for an ordinance to preserve 
these homes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the historic residences are the Rives Mansion and Casa de Parley Johnson, 
both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur and Mary Hendricks bought the Rives mansion five years ago. Arthur 
Hendricks, former publisher of two Swedish-language newspapers, died in 1987 
and left the house and business to his wife and his daughter, Jane. They are 
only the third owners of the house, which was built in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
The late Superior Court Judge James C. Rives built the mansion on the northwest 
corner of Paramount Boulevard and 3rd Street. It is also listed as a local 
historic site by the Downey Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Its style is similar to the classic antebellum Southern mansion with large 
white Greek columns supporting the front porch. It is the last of the Greek 
Revival homes remaining in Downey, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
Casa de Parley Johnson is a two-story Spanish Colonial Revival residence of the 
Monterey genre. Lawrence said it was built in 1926 by the noted Southern 
California architect Roland A. Coate. He built it for prominent citrus grower 
and oilman Parley Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
It is an L-shaped house on Florence Avenue surrounded by courtyards, patios and 
gardens. The Spanish influence can be seen in the white stucco walls, red tile 
roof and French doors. 
</P>
<P>
Coate was a major proponent of the Monterey style in Southern California. His 
blend of Colonial and native California form revealed itself in a formal, yet 
country style. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence said that the colorful ceramic tile and woodwork have hardly been 
altered. The history and the architecture of the house make it worthy of 
preservation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The house is owned by the Assistance League of Downey, a philanthropic 
organization established in 1953. The house was donated to the league three 
years ago by Mrs. Parley (Gypsy) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees with the city's plans to preserve these homes. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Maniaci, of 8572 Cherokee Drive, whose house is also on the city's list, 
spoke against extending the moratorium during a recent City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be told what to do with my property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She explained later that she did not want any restrictions on her property 
because she and her husband might decide to sell it later. Maniaci's 
Mediterranean-style home was built in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to vote on adoption of the preservation ordinance 
sometime this year. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, owners of the 23 homes selected by the city must apply for 
conditional-use permits before demolishing their buildings. If the city decides 
that a house has historic value, it will give the owner the alternative of 
selling the house and allowing the buyer to move it to another location to 
preserve it.

LATINO CANDIDATES HOPE THIS IS THEIR YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ACTIVISTS SEE THE APRIL 10 VOTE FOR 3 HUNTINGTON PARK COUNCIL SEATS 
AS THEIR BEST CHANCE TO REMEDY UNDER-REPRESENTATION.

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They met in a small room above a local Mexican restaurant, plotting political 
changes for a city that never has had a Latino councilman even though its 
population is more than 90% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 20 Latino businessmen, community leaders and residents who 
gathered recently said Latino candidates have their best chance ever to win 
seats on the City Council come election day, April 10. The city is facing 
financial problems that demand new leadership, they said. And Latino voter 
registration has grown significantly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
For years, voting rights advocates and Latino political activists have pointed 
to Huntington Park as a glaring example of political under-representation. It 
is a community where an ethnic minority has become a vast majority without 
being able to cross the political threshold into City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the Hispanic population is over 90% and there's a big problem there," 
said Rudy Griego, former Chamber of Commerce president who this year plans to 
run for council himself or, for the first time, to support Latino challengers. 
"It's quite important because the situation has become that we're being taxed 
without representation." 
</P>
<P>
Griego and two other Latino leaders, who have declared their candidacies, 
complain that none of the city's nine top administrators are Latino and that 
just two of Huntington Park's 18 appointed commissioners are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
But such criticisms and talk of political change do not set well with the 
city's veteran councilmen. Three of the five council seats will be up for 
election. Councilmen William P. Cunningham and Jim Roberts say they will fight 
to keep their seats. Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. said he has not decided 
whether to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents said they have been reelected over the years because they have 
served the community well. There have been few Latino administrators, 
commissioners and developers in Huntington Park because few have applied, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the calls for Latino representation on the council smack of reverse racism, 
the incumbents said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my fault I'm not Latino," Cunningham said. "When I represent people, 
I represent them all no matter what color they are. I always have." 
</P>
<P>
Latino candidates have run -- and been defeated -- in every Huntington Park 
City Council election since 1970. But the outcome this year could be different 
for several reasons, political observers said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's recent financial problems may have weakened the political strength 
of the incumbents. Recent money problems forced city officials to lay off 25 
employees last October and to cut services. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Latinos appear to be getting more involved in local politics and 
are expected to make up a larger majority of the voters registered for the 
April election. Latinos accounted for 53.3% of the city's registered voters in 
1988, according to a survey. A Latino had the strongest showing ever that year, 
falling 21 votes shy of being elected to the City Council. Community groups 
plan registration drives in the months before this year's election. 
</P>
<P>
Griego's break with the council also is viewed as a significant development. 
Griego, 50, supported Councilmen Jack W. Parks and Thomas E. Jackson in their 
successful reelection bids in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Two Latino candidates have said they will run in the April election. They are 
Raul Perez, who lost the 1988 election by 21 votes, and Luis Hernandez, the 
founder of a new citizens group of about 200 people called Huntington Park 
Citizens for Responsible Government. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the sixth time Perez has run for the council. Over the years, the 
47-year-old loan officer and longtime resident has developed a following that 
figures to be enhanced by Griego's support. Perez has been a member of numerous 
civic organizations and religiously attends council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial analyst, grew up in and around Huntington 
Park. He went to work in New York after graduating from college, but returned 
about seven months ago. Hernandez led the campaign against a proposed 7% city 
utility tax, which was overwhelmingly rejected by voters last year. He has been 
castigating council members on a variety of issues at their twice-monthly 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
If Griego decides to enter the race, he could be the strongest Latino candidate 
ever to run, local political observers said. 
</P>
<P>
But Griego has a liability. A former Huntington Park resident, Griego now lives 
in Granada Hills and would have to move back into the city by the end of the 
month to be eligible to run for City Council. He almost certainly would be 
criticized as a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
Griego can point to his involvement in various Huntington Park business and 
civic organizations, however. He also has had an immigration business in the 
city since 1970. Griego's Americo International provides assistance to 
immigrants seeking to become citizens, among other services. 
</P>
<P>
Margin Has Slipped 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents used to be shoo-ins for reelection, but they have seen their 
margin of victory slip over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, for example, the top incumbent voter-getter received 1,626 votes, 
while the strongest Latino candidate received 844. In 1988, Councilman Jackson 
finished first with 1,151. Councilman Parks finished second with 1,061 votes, 
while Perez had 1,040 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"No election was ever very close until last year," said Jackson, who has held 
his council seat since 1968, and would face reelection in 1992. "I would think 
that under the circumstances as they exist today, there's a good opportunity" a 
Latino will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
That would have been unthinkable before Huntington Park's transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park is now one of the poorest communities in the nation, according 
to a recent report by a Chicago-based urbanologist. 
</P>
<P>
The median household income in Huntington Park was $15,481 in 1985, compared to 
$23,905 countywide, according to the latest projections based on the 1980 
census. Unemployment in Huntington Park is higher than the county average, 
according to figures from the state Employment Development Department. The 
average unemployment rate in Huntington Park in 1988 was 7.4% compared to the 
4.9% countywide average. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1950s and into the '60s, Huntington Park was a middle-class white 
community that would have provided a perfect setting for "Leave It to Beaver," 
some longtime residents said. Pacific Boulevard, the city's commercial hub, 
featured many top-name retail stores that attracted shoppers from miles around. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1950s we were very much a bobby-socks, poodle-skirt, homecoming-type 
community," said Councilman Roberts, who has lived in the city nearly all of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, businessmen and educators say the transformation began in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The student body was mostly white when Leon Leyson began teaching at Huntington 
Park High in 1958. Yearbooks show campus institutions, such as the homecoming 
court, changed from predominantly white to Latino by 1975. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, Huntington Park's population had grown to 46,223, according to the 
1980 U.S. Census. Latinos accounted for nearly 81% of the city's residents. 
Latinos accounted for 90.6% of the city's 59,000 residents in 1989, according 
to projections based on the 1980 census. (The Census Bureau did not separate 
Latinos into a statistical category before 1980.) 
</P>
<P>
City officials and local residents cite different reasons for the demographic 
change. Some say the 1965 riots in Watts, just south of Huntington Park, 
triggered white flight. Others say the children who grew up in Huntington Park 
naturally sought to live in newer suburbs outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park became a city of renters. More than 76% of the 15,600 housing 
units in the city were occupied by renters in 1988, the last year for which 
figures are available, said Rudy Munoz, assistant director of community 
development. Relatively low housing prices drew immigrants who have been pushed 
northward by economic and political conditions in Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The change has affected virtually every corner of the city. Spanish is the 
dominant language in the stores and restaurants on Pacific Boulevard. 
Restaurants offering carne asada and pupusas, a Salvadoran dish, are as common 
as those offering steak and potatoes. Most churches conduct services in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Civic organizations, such as the Kiwanis and Jaycees, have Latino membership 
and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Low Voter Registration 
</P>
<P>
But the makeup of the City Council, the most powerful institution in the city, 
has remained unchanged. And the incumbents bristle at any hint that they have 
tried to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of Hispanics on the council is not because of any actions the council 
has taken," Councilman Hennes said. "They're free elections." 
</P>
<P>
Local political observers and voting rights advocates identify various factors 
that have kept Latinos off the Huntington Park City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Latino voter registration in Huntington Park has been low. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, voter registration in Huntington Park dropped from 19,284 in 1940 to 
7,880 last September, according to a spokeswoman for the county 
registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos accounted for only 21% of the city's registered voters in 1975 and 30% 
in 1980, according to surveys by Richard Loya, a local teacher who has run for 
City Council three times. Loya obtained his figures by counting Spanish 
surnames on voter registration rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration drives by local activists helped boost the figure to 53.3% 
in August, 1988, according to a survey commissioned by the Southwest Voter 
Registration Education Project, a Texas-based voter rights organization that 
has an office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Latino registration has been low, in part, because many of the city's residents 
are immigrants who are ineligible to vote, city officials and political 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one voter rights advocate theorizes that some eligible Latinos may 
have chosen not to register because they have been turned off by a political 
system that has excluded Latinos. "They aren't apathetic. They just made a wise 
decision. Our votes don't count so we don't vote," said Richard Martinez, the 
local representative of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is campaign spending. Incumbents have been able to raise and 
spend substantially more campaign money than their opponents. In 1988, for 
example, Jackson and Parks ran a joint campaign and spent about $38,000 
compared to $7,000 spent by Perez, according to campaign disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino leaders said the upcoming election battle will focus on the city's 
poor financial condition and the cutbacks. The recreation program, for example, 
has been virtually eliminated at two parks since last year. City Hall also has 
gone to a four-day week, closing every Friday. New fees for tree maintenance 
and other services have been imposed on residents. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders said they will call for increased police protection to 
deal with the city's increasing crime problem. The number of serious crimes, 
including murder, rape and auto theft, has risen from 3,573 incidents in 1983 
to 4,334 incidents in 1988, according to Police Department statistics. Gang 
crime is on the rise, with six gang-related murders reported in the past six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
But they also said Latino representation on the council is important, that a 
Latino who speaks Spanish will be better able to communicate with and serve the 
residents of Huntington Park. A Latino council member would be more interested 
in providing services such as civics programs to enable recently arrived 
residents to become more involved in city affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Latino leaders alleged that the incumbents have excluded 
Latinos from decision-making positions and from potentially lucrative city 
programs and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Griego noted that few of the more than 80 redevelopment projects built or 
planned by the city have Latino owners. Fewer than five Latinos have been 
principal developers in city projects, said Jack Wong, director of community 
development. The city has provided many of its developers with greatly 
discounted land prices and other subsidies to encourage development. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking them to give us the same treatment as they give their people," 
Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilmen Roberts said the economically depressed city has been in no 
position to pick and choose developers. "We weren't searching for any race," 
Roberts said. "We were just looking for someone to do projects." 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment program, the biggest source of pride for the council 
members, may also be a liability in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
Project delays in the early and mid-1980s left the city's Redevelopment Agency 
without enough property tax revenue to repay its debts. As a result, more than 
$14 million in city revenue for general services was loaned to the 
Redevelopment Agency to cover the debt. Those loans helped contribute to the 
cash shortage that forced the layoffs last October, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council members note that the financial drain is easing because 
property values in the city's redevelopment zones have risen, producing more 
tax revenue to pay the bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents said the redevelopment program will prove invaluable to Latinos 
and everyone else in the community because the new developments provide 
hundreds of jobs and hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax money for 
city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
They also note that hundreds of dilapidated housing units have been replaced 
with new housing through redevelopment. Twenty-five percent of the 1,036 
housing units constructed through redevelopment are for residents with low and 
moderate incomes, said Munoz, the assistant director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming race is likely to test loyalties and strain relationships in 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham and Roberts said they have begun seeking the support of local Latino 
leaders. One of their supporters is Samuel Magana, a prominent local restaurant 
owner who in the past has donated the use of his facilities for fund-raisers. 
Magana said he endorsed Roberts and Cunningham because he thinks they are doing 
a good job and they were the first to approach him. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it (Latino representation) important if the Hispanic is as 
qualified as the (council members) we have there," Magana said. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber of Commerce President Jessica R. Maes said she has not taken a position 
in the upcoming election. But Maes did attend the recent meeting that was 
organized by Griego to identify Latino candidates. The chamber president, who 
has not campaigned actively in past elections, said the Latino community needs 
representatives on the City Council who "understand our culture and our 
traditions." 
</P>
<P>
It is that type of interest from established members of the community that is 
likely to make the April race the most strongly contested in city history. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Daniels, vice president of administration at L &amp; F Industries in 
Huntington Park, has worked on campaigns for incumbents Cunningham, Roberts and 
Jackson. He said he will support Cunningham, Roberts and Hennes -- if Hennes 
decides to run. But Daniels declined to predict the outcome of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't put five bucks on it," Daniels said. "It's going to be close."

COAST COMMISSION DEADLOCKS ON PICKING CHIEF IN STRUGGLE OVER CONTROL OF PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission has deadlocked on the choice of a new 
chairman, with environmentalists and pro-development members at odds over who 
should head the panel. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting in Marina del Rey, the commission split 6 to 6 between 
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, backed by environmentalists, and 
David Malcolm, a Chula Vista city councilman aligned with pro-development 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesman Jack Liebster said the matter will be reconsidered at the 
group's meeting next month in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
David Hart, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said the leadership fight highlights the 
struggle for control over direction of the 12-member commission, established to 
protect the state's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the outcome of the race will be a clear indication of whether the 
commission will be more oriented toward developers or will "continue . . . its 
relatively good record of fairly applying the Coastal Act." 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Act of 1976 allowed local governments to regulate coastal 
development by adopting new land-use plans and zoning ordinances. The 
commission is responsible for approving the local plans. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she became a candidate only after Robert Franco of Del Rey Oaks, a 
pro-environmental commissioner, was unable to win a majority of votes for the 
chairmanship. "He didn't know if he could get the seventh vote and that's where 
my name came in as an alternative," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to contrast herself and Malcolm, Howard said: "I am more of an 
environmentalist and I guess that's really where the difference comes in. 
Malcolm is probably more developmentally oriented than I am." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm, a real estate developer, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the administration of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a liberal Democrat 
with strong environmental leanings, the commission was dominated by 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
With the election of Gov. George Deukmejian in 1982, the balance of power 
shifted. Deukmejian, who has called for the abolition of the commission, 
appointed four new members who generally shared his view that land-use planning 
is best left to local officials. In addition, Deukmejian reduced the agency's 
budget and staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's Democratic leaders helped win appointment for several 
commissioners in the early 1980s who appeared to be more sympathetic to 
developers than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Howard was appointed to the commission in 1987 by the Democratic-controlled 
Senate Rules Committee after a lengthy search for an environmentalist who could 
win Senate confirmation. The Rules Committee, Deukmejian and Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) can each appoint four commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move last month, Howard told fellow commissioners that she was 
resigning, citing personal problems involving the death of her husband and her 
desire not to take on additional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's husband of 34 years died last March from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound. At the time, Howard was recovering from a fractured pelvis she suffered 
in a fall at her home. 
</P>
<P>
But she changed her mind about leaving the commission, Howard said, after 
learning that "it would take several months to have someone appointed to my 
seat. I felt that was unfair to the commission, so I'm staying. . . . I am more 
committed than ever to the commission."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The televised weekly meetings of the City Council could become the latest 
victim of the city's budget crunch, now that the council has pulled the plug on 
its cable network. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the council axed the Community Communications Network, which 
videotapes the council meetings every Tuesday and televises them on Channel 36 
on Mondays and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
All seven jobs in the Public Affairs Department are being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which are to take effect Feb. 9, are among the latest in a budget 
crisis that already has cost about 85 city employees their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, however, are being asked to consider a proposal from some 
employees in the department to become private contractors for the purpose of 
continuing cable coverage of City Council meetings, said John D. Johnson, 
special assistant to City Manager Howard Caldwell. The manager's staff, Johnson 
said, is evaluating the proposal. The council has not yet seen it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council broadcasts began in 1983, according to Sumire Gant, director of 
the network and Public Affairs Department.

DEUKMEJIAN SAYS HE WON'T OUST TRUSTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian said last week he would not ask the chairwoman of the 
California State University trustees to resign, although she made a "bad 
mistake" by misrepresenting her educational background. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in San Diego, Deukmejian said Huntington Beach resident 
Marianthi K. Lansdale has apologized to him for claiming a community college 
degree she did not have when the governor first nominated her to the 
prestigious CSU Board of Trustees nearly four years ago. The claim was also 
forwarded to the state Senate, which confirmed her nomination for a term that 
expires in March 1993. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor praised Lansdale for doing an "outstanding job" as a trustee 
and added: "At the present time, I am not intending to ask her to resign." 
</P>
<P>
"From all accounts, she has been doing a superb job," Deukmejian said in his 
first comments on the matter. "She works very hard at it. She has been very 
effective. And she is a real fine representative for the system. 
</P>
<P>
"But she shouldn't have said what she said," he added. "She has acknowledged 
that. She regrets it. It was a bad mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale admitted to The Times last month that she never received a 1959 
Associate of Arts degree from Long Beach City College as she claimed at the 
time of her 1985 appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lansdale said she accumulated the 60 credits "equivalent" for an AA 
degree, she conceded she lacked a required course in either geography or 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale's admission caused such a furor that she issued a public apology and 
offered to give a personal explanation in January to the Senate Rules 
Committee, which is responsible for confirming gubernatorial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who is chairman 
of the Rules Committee, said Lansdale should resign. The controversy also 
inspired proposed legislation by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to empower 
the Senate to remove any gubernatorial appointee caught lying about his 
educational background. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CSU trustees last week passed a resolution expressing their "full 
support" of Lansdale. Deukmejian kept mum until Thursday, when he met with 
reporters before touring the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question she made a mistake, and she has acknowledged that 
publicly and to me personally," Deukmejian said. "She apparently had sufficient 
credits to earn a degree but she did not actually have a degree. 
</P>
<P>
"But she did represent that she had it and it was a big mistake for her to 
make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, she has done an outstanding job as a member of the Board of 
Trustees to such an extent that her fellow members of that board have selected 
her to be the chairperson and she has been serving in that capacity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale and her husband, Long Beach developer William M. Lansdale, gave 
Deukmejian more than $100,000 in money and in the use of an airplane during the 
1982 gubernatorial campaign.

ASSEMBLYMAN HILL'S VOTE COSTS COLLEAGUE $3,600;

<P>
How much is one vote worth at the state Capitol? 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) last week, the answer was 
more than $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
That's how much one Democratic assemblyman paid to rent a private plane so that 
Hill could show up to vote at the state Capitol on a controversial no-fault 
auto insurance measure. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, Hill was whisked 
Wednesday morning from an El Monte airport in a twin-turbo prop plane to a 
landing strip 30 miles east of Sacramento -- a location selected to avoid the 
low-lying winter fog. Once on the ground, Hill was greeted by a legislative 
sergeant-at-arms, who promptly drove him to an Assembly committee meeting to 
cast a vote for Johnston's no-fault bill. 
</P>
<P>
Hill quickly left the room, was driven back to the foothill airstrip and hopped 
on the plane back to Southern California, where he is running to fill a vacancy 
in the 31st Senate District, which covers portions of Orange County and the 
Southeast cities of Whittier, La Mirada and La Habra Heights. Then, Hill 
delivered a noontime speech, got on a commercial airplane and once again flew 
to Sacramento late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Hill's extraordinary trip, Johnston's no-fault insurance bill was 
defeated by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said he decided to fly Hill up to Sacramento because a preliminary 
head count showed the vote on the bill would be close. Johnston said he wanted 
to make sure all his supporters -- including Hill -- were present. 
</P>
<P>
The cost: $3,645, paid out of Johnston's campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It was painful to expend the money, I assure you. But it was in the pursuit of 
a governmental purpose," said Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Hill conceded that his morning flight on Wednesday was "unusual" but it was for 
a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big bill," he said.

ERNIE ANDREWS: LIFE ON EVENTFUL PHILIP MORRIS TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's hard to adjust," Ernie Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, the veteran Los Angeles-based jazz, pop and blues singer 
returned home after a three-month tour of five continents as featured vocalist 
with the 18-man ensemble billed as Gene Harris and the Philip Morris Superband. 
</P>
<P>
As Andrews made clear, after working under the extraordinary conditions that 
prevailed during that tour, anything would seem anticlimactic. "It was the most 
luxurious situation imaginable -- the sky was the limit when it came to 
treating us right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he is by any means scuffling for jobs -- he just played to good crowds 
at Marla's Memory Lane. On Feb. 10, he will sing in Exposition Park as part of 
the "Black Esthetic" presentation of the Afro-American Museum. The next day he 
heads for Washington, where he will address the students at the Duke Ellington 
School of the Arts, and will later share a concert at Kennedy Center with 
Marlena Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
Good gigs all, but somehow not the same as earning standing ovations in Cairo, 
Ankara, Morocco, Moscow, Milan, Manila, Melbourne and Perth. (The band played 
only one domestic date, a break-in session at New York's Town Hall, which was 
recorded for Concord Jazz.) 
</P>
<P>
For economic reasons, a tour of this kind would have been impossible in the 
United States. "We were in four- and five-star hotels everywhere," Andrews 
said. "In some cities we'd stay several days and only play one or two concerts, 
but our days off cost us almost nothing; they paid for our hotels." The 
sponsors also arranged for several of the musicians' wives to fly over for part 
of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We ate well and slept well, we lived royally; so there were no animosities," 
Andrews said. "On an Italian date, we had three band buses -- one for the sound 
crew, one for the smoking musicians and another for the nonsmokers." (An ironic 
touch, given the cigarette sponsorship.) 
</P>
<P>
By sheer chance, the band -- which ranges in age from 26-year-old trombone 
virtuoso James Morrison from Australia along with the 74-year-old trumpeter 
Harry (Sweets) Edison -- managed to stay just ahead of the dramatic political 
events that were taking place in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at the Jazz Festival in West Berlin, with Wynton Marsalis and Take 6; 
the next day we played East Berlin, where the people wouldn't let us off the 
stage," Andrews said. "Two days later we heard the Wall had come down! In 
Manila we stayed at the same hotel where they had all the problems, but we were 
out of there three days before the coup started. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland was wonderful. We were each given a couple of thousand dollars of their 
money to spend -- not that there was much to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia was a bit of a culture shock at first, but the enthusiasm was so great 
that fans were offering $150, as much as most of them earn in a month, for a 
ticket. We were invited over to the Composers' Union Building, where after 
lunch several Russian musicians played with some of our guys." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense the tour with Harris completed a full circle, since Andrews first 
came to international prominence as a band vocalist in the 1950s and '60s, with 
the orchestra of the late Harry James. Born in 1927 in Philadelphia, Andrews 
has lived in Los Angeles since his late teens and began his recording career in 
the 1940s. Though he now works locally mainly as a single, he gigged and 
recorded during most of the 1980s with the Frank Capp/Nat Pierce Juggernaut big 
band. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the musicians are home now: about half in New York, James Moody in San 
Diego, bassist Ray Brown in Los Angeles, guitarist Herb Ellis in Fairfield Bay, 
Ark., and pianist-leader Gene Harris in Boise, Ida., where for the previous 
decade he had lived quietly and in relative obscurity as musical director for a 
local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently that obscurity is not destined to last. From Boise, Harris said: "It 
looks as though I'm on call with Philip Morris. They helped arrange for me to 
play a performance in Washington with President Bush in the audience, Jan. 22 
at the Willard Hotel, for the Libertad organization, with Charlton Heston 
emceeing. 
</P>
<P>
"As for the tour, the news is promising. I can't give out the details, but I 
haven't done my last tour yet. Meanwhile some of the best videos out of a whole 
bunch that were taken while we were traveling will be assembled for public 
television in the States." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Jimenez, a representative of the Bridge Agency which contracted the 
tour, said plans are to reorganize the band with many of the same musicians for 
a fall tour. "Next time, instead of a single U.S. date, we expect to put on two 
or three concerts in this country, probably including runs in Los Angeles," 
Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
This is heartening news for the musicians as well. Andrews summed it up: "There 
just isn't anything to match the blessings of those conditions for an artist. 
You praise the Lord that you're out there having a ball, pleasing those great 
audiences in big halls, and being kept in comfort. You really feel at peace 
with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings for two record reviews were incorrect last week. Mike Fahn's "Steppin' 
Out" should receive 4 1/2 stars and "Gene Harris and the Philip Morris 
Superband" should rate four stars.

ROCK EN ESPANOL RACES TO U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. IMPORTS NEW ROCK MUSIC FROM SPANISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Argentine rock star Miguel Mateos was puzzled last summer when he began 
receiving dozens of fan letters postmarked far from his Buenos Aires home -- 
places like Chicago, New York, Miami and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Mateos, whose recordings have sold more than 1.2 million copies in Latin 
America and who has shared concert billing in his country with such 
international rock acts as Queen and INXS, had never stepped on stage in the 
United States and his records were barely known here. 
</P>
<P>
So why these fan letters? 
</P>
<P>
"I realized something is happening here," Mateos said in an interview during a 
break from a band rehearsal in a Burbank sound studio. 
</P>
<P>
Curious about what prompted the fan mail, Mateos -- a 35-year-old 
singer-songwriter whose music combines some of the social commentary of John 
Cougar Mellencamp with the more traditional melodic hard-rock of Bon Jovi -- 
came to L.A. last September to test the waters. 
</P>
<P>
He played one night at the Palace in Hollywood, selling out the 1,500-capacity 
hall and leaving another 500 frustrated fans waiting outside. Reviewing the 
show for The Times, staff writer Victor Valle hailed Mateos' music as having 
"the tough, rebellious bite worthy of rock 'n' roll's aggressive, urban 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Mateos found himself in the vanguard of a new kind of music -- Rock 
en Espanol. The sound is hard-driving rock 'n' roll with little influence from 
other types of Latin music including the soft, pop sounds of such artists as 
Julio Iglesias or Gloria Estefan. The target audience: Spanish-speaking youth 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mateos: "I try to explain to American reporters that I'm doing rock, Latin 
music has more to do with percussion and the Caribbean rhythms," Mateos said. 
"I tell them I'm doing rock 'n' roll, hard guitars and all that stuff. Then, 
when they hear me play, they say 'Yes, you were right. This is rock 'n' roll.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Enter Jack Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt is a 44-year-old rock concert promoter who has worked over the last two 
decades with such major rock acts as Pink Floyd and Hall &amp; Oates before 
tiring of the business and going into "retirement" in the early '80s, dividing 
his time between his Northern California ranch and his Catalina Island haven. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he decide to go back to work. But he was tired of dealing with the same 
type of rock acts. His goal was to find a new musical niche for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do the same old shows that I've been doing for years," 
Leavitt said. "That's just no fun. The music was old to me. How many times can 
you see Hall &amp; Oates?" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, he began to think Latin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at the different music of Hispanics," Leavitt said. "These 
friends of mine were telling me there was this big thing going on in Argentina 
and Venezuela but nobody would book them here. They gave me some tapes and I 
went, 'Jesus, these guys are great!' " 
</P>
<P>
So, last year Leavitt began setting up concert tours for the bands that seemed 
the most likely to catch on in heavily Latino areas of the United States. Some 
of those attractions -- including Mateos -- will be touring the United States 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big market for this," said Enrique Blanc, production coordinator 
for L.A.'s KNSE-AM (1510), a Spanish-language radio station. "With people of 
all types immigrating and many having listened to Rock en Espanol, I think 
there's a potential, though perhaps not in every area. But, I think in the big 
cities it will be a big phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
A producer for MTV International, Alejandro Pels, agrees. "Things are really 
beginning to happen with this music," he said. "You're probably not going to 
have 4 million records sold by one of these bands from one day to the next, but 
the most important thing is that the (American record) industry is beginning to 
pay attention to this. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any kind of music that wasn't sung in English has been big here 
ever. . . . But this is something that's going to be growing. There's 30 
million Hispanics in this country. There was a void for the Latin youth and 
this is filling that void." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such optimism, Leavitt regards his latest venture as a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
This week he's launching the most ambitious U.S. tour ever attempted by 
Spanish-language rockers. Mateos will headline, backed by his mostly American 
five-person band, and a popular Spanish trio called Duncan Dhu will open for 
them. The two bands will perform in 18 cities from New York to Los Angeles, in 
3,000-5,000 seat auditoriums, culminating in a show at the Hollywood Palladium 
on Feb. 11. (Tonight, Mateos is scheduled to appear in Anaheim at the Celebrity 
Theater.) 
</P>
<P>
The Mateos-Duncan Dhu bill is being closely watched by the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the Mateos tour) is going to open up more tours to come through 
America," says Mike Missile, BMG Records director of marketing for Rock en 
Espanol. "I think it's opening the door for bands to come over and be taken 
seriously. The logic behind it is that Latin youth in America is receptive to 
either language. I think you'll see a lot more of this." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big weight on my shoulders," said Mateos with a shudder. "So, I'm 
trying not to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
But promoters and record industry executives are thinking about it. Already 
nearly a dozen Rock en Espanol shows are planned for this year, said Missile. 
Some of the bands expected to tour include the Mexican group Caifanes and 
Argentine rockers GIT, Charly Garcia and Soda Stereo. 
</P>
<P>
What sets these bands and Mateos and Duncan Dhu apart from other Latin-American 
artists is that their music is pure rock 'n' roll and does not contain many of 
the rhythms and sounds associated with "Latin music." 
</P>
<P>
"When people think of Hispanic music, they think of Julio (Iglesias)," Missile 
said. "We want to put the spotlight on rock. . . . It isn't Latin, it's rock. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tower Records, which used to throw Spanish-language rock albums in the 
same bin with Iglesias or salsa queen Celia Cruz, this month will start a 
separate section for Rock en Espanol, Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago the record companies wouldn't distribute them," Pels said. 
</P>
<P>
Trip Reeb, general manager of KROQ-FM (106.7), which prides itself on playing 
"new music" (though most of it is by British and American groups), said Duncan 
Dhu's music was something that he considered putting on the station's play 
list. "This is in every way on a par with anything that's being done in 
English." 
</P>
<P>
"They're already kings in their own country and it's just new challenges for 
them," Missile said of the bands. "This is the rock nation and I think this is 
a dream to some of them, to conquer America. Now, they have that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Mateos says it is indeed a dream come true for him to play in the United 
States. He got his start 10 years ago, after winning a contest in which he beat 
out 100 other bands to open for Queen in a huge soccer stadium in Argentina. 
Five years and four albums later, he returned to the same stadium as the 
headliner filling all 50,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the biggest days of my life," he said. "It was like a dream. I 
began to cry. And now, to be able to come and play in the country of rock 'n' 
roll," he stops and gazes off in seeming disbelief. "I think this decade is 
going to open up a lot of new possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Mateos' golden-haired, blue-eyed good looks suggest comparisons physically to 
Don Henley and U2's Bono. One of Mateo's most accessible songs, "Cuando Seas 
Grande" ("When You're Grown Up"), has a hard-driving beat and deals with the 
universal themes of youthful rebellion and confusion about one's place in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample lyrics: "I'm a guy of the streets/I walk the city and don't bother 
anyone/I want to cut the chains. ... But when I go home, I hear only 'What are 
you going to do when you grow up? Be a rock and roll star? Become president?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite limited radio air play -- in Los Angeles, only Spanish-language 
station KLVE-FM (107.5) has begun playing some of the biggest acts -- many of 
those in the audience are familiar with the music, having heard it in the 
countries they emigrated from or about it from friends and relatives in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is like the strongest market," Pels said. "In Mexico, rock in Spanish hit 
very hard two to three years ago. Huge bands from Argentina and Spain went to 
Mexico for the first time, and they began to play them on the radio. That 
influence gets much faster to L.A. than to the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt wants to introduce the music to the remaining Spanish-speaking 
Americans who have not yet heard Rock en Espanol. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to break down barriers and show people this stuff's hot," Leavitt 
said. "It may work and it may not. No one knows because no one's done it." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic red tape and auditorium owners fearing gang violence have 
not made this ambitious tour an easy one to organize, Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some halls won't let them in," Leavitt said. "They're afraid of gang wars. 
They make huge demands on deposits or they'll say they're booked, but it's 
B.S." 
</P>
<P>
And, though crowds may be flocking to see them, no one involved is exactly 
getting rich -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs so much to bring them over here," Leavitt said, adding that an 
average entourage includes about 35 people, as well as busloads of lighting and 
sound equipment. "We're not making a lot of money yet. We're just looking to 
break even." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Mateos tour -- which is scheduled to hit several venues in Northern 
and Southern California as well as Phoenix, Albuquerque, several Texan cities, 
Chicago, New York, Miami and Puerto Rico -- will likely cost more than 
$300,000. Paul Mitchell systems, which manufactures hair-care products, is 
underwriting the tour, Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this music is not in English, widely perceived as the language of 
rock, could put off some listeners, Mateos acknowledges. He does not expect to 
have crossover success in the Anglo market unless he records some songs in 
English. That is something he plans to do eventually, when he finds the right 
writing collaborator, but in the meantime he is concentrating on attracting 
Spanish-speaking audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are a lot of Latin people who want to listen to rock in Spanish 
with the same kind of professionalism as (that sung in) English," Mateos said. 
</P>
<P>
What about those who say these groups are just copycats? Pels responds by 
saying: "I don't think they are copying what is going on here in the United 
States. They are influenced by it. When punk came up, they adopted it too. But 
their lyrics, the good bands sing about their own things, their own countries. 
The Spanish language has its own rhythm. They like to play with words, they're 
sort of surrealist." 
</P>
<P>
But, there are also those who point to the drawbacks of lyrics in a foreign 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt responds to such criticism with practicality: "If you listen to an 
English band, Phil Collins or whoever and you're more than 100 feet from the 
stage, you can't understand what he says anyway. Espanol music is music. You 
just can't understand the vocal that well, but I never listen to vocals anyway. 
. . . Most songs don't make any sense. What's 'Stairway to Heaven?' What the 
hell does that mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Missile believes that the improved sound quality of rock 'n' roll in Spanish 
will draw more listeners. (Increasingly, many Latin artists are producing 
records here in the United States with producers well-versed in the latest 
techniques.) 
</P>
<P>
"In the past people threw the argument at you that if kids want to listen to 
rock, they'll listen to it in English," Missile said. "They said English was 
the language of rock 'n' roll. I think the production qualities of Spanish rock 
just weren't up to par. Now, that's changed. They're creating their own sound, 
and it fits in with the international youth sound of rock. Europe is open to 
all languages, and I think that's starting to happen in America." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mateos: "I think it's the breaking point. We have no more wall of Berlin. 
So it's time for us, maybe. We can tear down some walls now."

Is this the show that launched a thousand quips? Is this the art that caused 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to say its maker was no artist and his work was junk? 
Is this the cause of congressional consternation over the National Endowment 
for the Arts, the grounds to legislate against throwing taxpayers' dollars away 
to subsidize such junk? 
</P>
<P>
Can this possibly be the same exhibition that brought dismay and disgrace to 
the venerable Corcoran Gallery when it chickened out of presenting it in the 
nation's capital? Aesthetes were furious. Artists canceled exhibitions. The 
Corcoran's beleaguered director Christina Orr-Cahal was eventually forced to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Yup. This is the show all right. "The Perfect Moment," photographs and other 
works by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, is now on view at the University Art 
Museum, UC Berkeley, until March 18. It's hard to imagine it igniting any 
further fuss in puritanically liberal Berkeley, but you never know. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a particularly large show for a retrospective and certainly not in 
proportion to its notoriety. But it is a primo example of what happens to art 
when it becomes the focus of controversy. Its opponents damn so fervently that 
it starts to sound titillating. Mapplethorpe's enemies paint him as a scuzzy 
pornographer, a Marquis de Sade delighting in pain and torture. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, if it's that naughty, it might be a kick. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting the time-honored principle of le succes de scandale, polarized 
supporters over-praise their hero's virtues. Mapplethorpe's admirers hymn him 
as a perfectionist who captured each subject at an instant of classic glamour, 
be it in a sculptural torso or the exquisite edge of a calla lily. Wow, this 
guy sounds like the greatest artist since Michelangelo met Aubrey Beardsley -- 
and a martyr to the Philistines to boot. Better check it out. 
</P>
<P>
The wearily predictable result is an exhibition that everybody looks at but 
nobody sees. 
</P>
<P>
How can anybody possibly concentrate on wafting nuances of artistic expression 
when the art has been so badly used that the only pertinent question seems to 
be: Why all the fuss? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, if this culture was even fractionally as tolerant as it ought to be, 
none of this would have happened. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe was a homosexual who died of AIDS last year at age 42. He made the 
ramifications of his sexuality into a principal theme of his art. In one triple 
self-portrait he shows himself first as a hard-case street-corner hooker in 
leather, then as a winsome androgyne and finally as a '40s style glamour girl. 
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. In a late example, he looks ravaged 
with illness and holds a skull-headed cane. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the New Yorker, critic Ingrid Sischy said that the real importance 
of this work is not in its aesthetic merit but in the liberating frankness of 
its homosexuality -- letting it also be known that she herself is gay. The 
observation was a significant reflection of a widespread current phenomenon in 
which art is used as a kind of cultural agit-prop promoting the attitudes of 
various special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
In that context Mapplethorpe's work might be seen as having achieved something. 
But in an imagined world where every artist is out to promote a cause we are 
still faced with the questions: Which artists are we going to prefer and why 
are we going to prefer them? One obvious answer in a climate of social advocacy 
is that we are going to prefer the artist whose political and psychological 
point of view is closest to our own. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting the suffocating egoism of such an aesthetic for the moment, let's 
ask if Mapplethorpe is an ideal representative of the gay point of view. The 
exhibition displays a portfolio of small prints that includes images of 
homosexual sadomasochism so extreme they cannot be reprinted or described in 
this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Some gay people might think this sort of thing gives them a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
As a social propagandist, Mapplethorpe's appeal is certainly too specialized to 
attract more more than a small cult following unless something else about his 
art speaks to larger human issues through empathy and excellence. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue essays for "The Perfect 
</P>
<P>
Moment" leave the impression that Mapplethorpe was a fastidiously tasteful, 
classically refined, fashionably glamorous, formally astute artist who directed 
his subjects' fare-thee-well, choosing hair styles, cosmetics, pose and 
lighting with the care of a diamond cutter. The actual exhibition so regularly 
contradicts this image that one suspects the writers of having got too enamored 
of their own theme of perfection. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside there are images here far more humane than the artist's chilly 
reputation. A perfectly endearing portrait of his friend Sam Wagstaff shows him 
bright, kindly and amused. A brooding William Burroughs has the hard-bought 
wisdom and dignity of a man who survived the woozy purgatory of decades of 
drugs and turned the experience into important literature. An image of 
Katherine Cebrian has the regal maturity of Edith Sitwell. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside it seems Mapplethorpe's reputation for glamour is largely 
undeserved. He could get it when it was there, but a couple of female sitters 
look more like arriviste bimbos than ladies of fashion. When he poses the 
body-builder Lisa Lyon nude with a huge snake it manages only the kitsch 
exoticism of Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. He did not photograph like a man of 
taste, cultivation and refinement. He photographed a street urchin's fantasy of 
it. Anybody interested in the elegant decadence of the Vienna Secession gets a 
vulgar McDonald's version of it here. Mapplethorpe was better at getting close 
to fin de siecle lurking madness that shows up regularly in Lyon's eyes and in 
those of his friend Patti Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe greatly admired Andy Warhol, sharing his auteur leanings to film 
and commercial work. He also apparently shared his tainted celebrity-worshiping 
naivete, but lacked his wit. There are flashes of it in the Magritte-like "Man 
in a Three Piece Suit" with its huge male member hanging like some silly 
elephant-trunk nightmare of exposure. There is mordant insight in a shot of a 
garden with a tiny Catholic cardinal in red sitting next to a fop in a lavender 
satin smoking jacket, but on the whole the artist was too rigid and obsessive 
to be funny or truly stylish. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation as a master of formal beauty is also fictionalized by the 
evidence. A diptych of a flower achieves its variety with a long shot and a 
close-up. A diptych of Smith shows inventiveness by having her stand up and 
then sit down. Warhol proved that playing dumb could be telling, but 
Mapplethorpe wasn't quite sharp enough to see the virtue of real dumbness. 
</P>
<P>
His "sculptural" photographs -- often symbolically loaded black male torsos -- 
work only occasionally, as in a shot of a ropey muscled arm. Usually such shots 
are impressive simply because the chosen model had a formidable body. 
Mapplethorpe relied enormously on subject matter; his own gifts -- while real 
-- were hampered by very limited expressive range and inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any larger human lesson to be gleaned from Mapplethorpe's 
sensibility, it may have to do with religion. The artist was a lapsed Catholic, 
a fact that would not be worth mentioning if that influence did not show up in 
his art. The earliest work on view is an enigmatic assemblage called "The 
Rack." An image of a haloed female saint -- perhaps the virgin -- stands 
holding her outer garment open, her hands pierced by real needles suspending a 
crucifix. The sides of the box are draped with two black cravats. One senses 
this religious theme continuing in later works, like a pair of heart-shaped 
reliquary boxes containing stilettos. There is ample suggestion, as in Warhol's 
work, that a curdled religious impulse lies somewhere behind even his most 
outrageous sadomasochistic visions. 
</P>
<P>
The question of what happens in a culture when the religious impulse goes wrong 
lurks in the air these days. It turned up recently in a film by the Spanish 
director Pedro Almodovar. Called "Dark Habits," having to do with a group of 
nuns that have gone off the rails, becoming junkies, harboring murderers and 
generally leading cheerfully anarchistic lives. 
</P>
<P>
This film and Mapplethorpe's art really raise questions about how far humankind 
can go in throwing off the shackles of ancient taboos -- represented first by 
religion and then by the constraints of society -- before the whole tortilla 
crumbles. They are shouting "Freedom" in Eastern Europe these days. We all 
applaud and quietly worry about how far this can go before there is trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Dark romantics like Mapplethorpe or Jim Morrison seek freedom unto death and 
leave the rest of us wondering how much of it we really need, how much of it, 
really, we can stand.

ACTIVISTS RIP MAHONY AT CATHOLIC MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: SUPPORTERS OF ABORTION AND AIDS RIGHTS SNEAK INTO A KNIGHTS OF 
COLUMBUS GATHERING AND DENOUNCE THE ARCHBISHOP AS A HYPOCRITE FOR CHURCH'S 
STANDS ON ABORTION, SAFE SEX AND CONDOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of AIDS and abortion rights activists posing as Knights of Columbus 
infiltrated a Catholic breakfast meeting Saturday in Hollywood and shouted down 
Archbishop Roger Mahony from a back table as he began the keynote address. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a liar, Mahony! Hypocrite! Murderer!" the four demonstrators screamed, 
as several members of the religious fraternal group leaped from their breakfast 
of bacon and scrambled eggs to drag the protesters from the Blossom Room at the 
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sbrizzi, 29, of Highland Park said he had organized the disruption with 
two other men and a woman to protest the Roman Catholic Church's stands against 
abortion and the use of condoms for safe sex. Sbrizzi said the four had acted 
as individuals, although all are members of ACT-UP LA, the AIDS Coalition To 
Unleash Power. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who were not arrested and later joined a picket line outside 
the hotel, had just come from an early morning demonstration outside a women's 
health clinic in Pacoima where about 600 supporters of abortion confronted 
about 250 abortion foes. The peaceful action was one of a number of rallies 
held nationwide to mark the 17th anniversary on Monday of Roe vs. Wade, the 
U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, who has been the target of protests by AIDS activists, took the 
disruption of his speech in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we're all awake . . .," he joked to the 150 or so men and women who 
had gathered for a seminar on pornography sponsored by the Southern California 
Chapter of the Knights of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the laughter subsided, Mahony told the group that they should "have 
the spirit of compassion and forgiveness for those who see things differently 
than we do." 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, I think it's important for us to stand by our convictions 
and beliefs. A few shouts and voices are not about to deter me from the great 
work which is ours still to do," the archbishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony has been the focus of several demonstrations protesting his stand that 
chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the only "morally correct and 
medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, four Roman Catholic churches in the Los Angeles area were spattered 
with red paint, and posters of Mahony with the word "murderer" printed in large 
letters were left at the church sites. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 25, a group of about 10 demonstrators disrupted Mahony's sermon during 
the midnight Christmas Mass at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, marching silently to 
the altar in black T-shirts bearing a pink triangle and the slogan "Silence 
Equals Death." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's action came as Mahony took the dais with Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich to present an award on behalf of the Knights of 
Columbus to the Blockbuster Video chain for "its pro-family policies." 
</P>
<P>
The chain, which has about 1,100 video stores nationwide, advertises itself as 
"America's Family Video Store," and allows cardholders to restrict the kinds of 
videos their minor children can check out. The store does not offer X-rated 
videos and did not stock "The Last Temptation of Christ," the controversial 
Oscar-nominated film depicting the life of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
However, John Fall, another member of ACT-UP LA who led the picketing outside 
the hotel, said the protest was unrelated to the award. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here on that," Fall said. "We're here to protest the church's 
condemnation of safe sex and condoms, and its position on Operation Rescue," a 
group opposing abortions that staged the Pacoima rally outside Her Clinic, a 
women's health center on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Before the breakfast address, Fall broke into an informal press conference 
Mahony was giving in the hotel lobby, shouting "You're a murderer, Mahony! Safe 
sex saves lives!" 
</P>
<P>
The action prompted hotel security officers to eject him from the hotel. But 
afterward, Sbrizzi, dressed in a coat and tie, slipped into the meeting room 
with Stuart Timmons of Silver Lake, Margie Eduardo of Valencia and Peter Siegel 
of West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The four discreetly seated themselves at a back table with the editor of the 
Knights' newsletter and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea what they were going to do," said the editor, Charles Lyons, a 
West Los Angeles Knight. "But I could tell they were pretty nervous, because 
they were quiet and didn't talk to the rest of us.

Masked Palestinians fatally stabbed a Gaza Strip Arab suspected of cooperating 
with Israeli authorities, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamza Al Fara, 65, was stabbed in the back and chest in the main market of Khan 
Younis. Since the start of the 25-month-old uprising against Israeli 
occupation, more than 160 Arabs accused of collaborating or immoral behavior 
have been killed by other Arabs. Elsewhere in the occupied Gaza Strip, two 
youths were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers. In the West Bank, an 
8-year-old boy was hit in the leg by a plastic bullet during confrontations in 
Ramallah. Two other Palestinians were reportedly wounded by rubber bullets.

U.S. officials reportedly suspect Israel of sending cluster bombs to Ethiopia 
and have unconfirmed reports that the Marxist government there has used them 
against rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed officials did not say when Israel might have sent the weapons, how 
many were involved or whether the bombs were American- or Israeli-made, the New 
York Times reported. It said Israel is seeking to establish strong relations 
with Ethiopia because it wants Addis Ababa's cooperation on allowing Ethiopian 
Jews to emigrate to Israel. An Israeli Embassy spokeswoman in Washington denied 
that Israel gave or sold cluster bombs to the Ethiopians.

Gunmen kidnaped a prominent journalist in Christian East Beirut and held him 
for eight hours as fellow journalists protested Christian leader Maj. Gen. 
Michael Aoun's restrictions on press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Police said gunmen in civilian garb stormed the apartment of newsman George 
Hajj, who works for the Christian Falangist newspaper Al Amal, and took him 
away. He was released unharmed eight hours later and said he had no explanation 
for his kidnaping. "Here I am free, and no one hurt me," he told reporters. 
Meanwhile, Aoun's soldiers and Syrian troops skirmished in northern Lebanon, 
interrupting traffic along the highway connecting the northern region with the 
Christian enclave in Beirut. Police said no casualties were reported.

L.A.'S ARSON SQUAD FIGHTS UNEVEN BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long before the embers had cooled in the $25-million Wilshire Corridor fire, a 
dozen city and federal arson investigators armed with sophisticated hydrocarbon 
detectors had arrived at the scene to determine where and how the spectacular 
blaze began. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, the team was able to declare that last month's conflagration, 
which forced 150 people from their luxury condominiums and homes, had been 
deliberately set, probably with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the chances of catching those responsible -- as in most arson fires in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere across the country -- are slim. 
</P>
<P>
Arson is one of the costliest crimes, experts say, but one of the easiest to 
get away with. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, arrests were made in only 15% of all 1988 arson cases, according to 
the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles last year, arrests were made in 21% of the cases investigated by 
the arson team. However, because some are minor and the department's resources 
are limited, the team investigated only about one-third of the fires found to 
have been deliberately set. In all, 288 arrests were made in more than 7,000 
cases of arson or other fires of suspicious origin in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustration inside arson units becomes palpable at times," said Alex A. 
Ahart, executive secretary of the International Assn. of Arson Investigators. 
"Not to sound flip, but arson is the first and only crime in the books where 
you've first got to able to prove that God didn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Arson is a prosecuting attorney's nightmare because he (usually) doesn't have 
the eyewitnesses, the fingerprints or the smoking gun." 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, suspects in high-profile Los Angeles blazes were freed shortly 
after being arrested because of a lack of clear-cut evidence. That happened 
after fires that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library and the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium during the late 1980s, as well as in the blaze earlier this month 
that destroyed a partially completed Los Feliz condominium complex 
</P>
<P>
Since so many cases go unprosecuted, some fire officials voice frustration with 
the district attorney's office, which they say has traditionally been hesitant 
to handle arson prosecutions built on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors, for 
their part, say they are stymied by the lack of hard evidence. Defense 
attorneys, meanwhile, are frustrated by the arrest of clients on what they 
contend are wild, misguided stabs at winning confessions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some critics within the Los Angeles Fire Department question 
whether its 19-member arson team can do an adequate job in a city of 3.4 
million people, where annual fire losses frequently exceed $100 million. They 
also complain that department officials have not been forceful enough in 
seeking additional manpower during city budget deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Others, outside the department, have raised similar questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how the guys (in Los Angeles) have enough time to do a good 
investigation on every fire," said Ahart, whose organization of arson 
investigators has 7,600 members nationwide. "You can only stretch yourself so 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, San Francisco, with a population of 731,700 people, has a 
15-member arson task force; Houston, with a population of 1.7 million people, 
has 60 arson investigators, and New York City, with a population of 7.3 million 
people, has more than 200 arson team members. 
</P>
<P>
In several interviews, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Lon Pursell 
insisted that the city's current manpower level is sufficient. But on Friday, 
Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis acknowledged, "No, we do not have enough people 
in the arson squad. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be beneficial to the department and the city," Ennis added, "if we 
could add, on an annual basis, another body or two." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of any debate about arson is the unique nature of the crime. 
Unlike with other offenses, experts first must determine whether a crime has 
actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a burglary, you're probably missing your TV. If you were robbed, 
you're probably missing your wallet and that's known right away," said the 
city's senior arson investigator, William S. Cass. 
</P>
<P>
But when a fire breaks out, Cass said, arson experts must sift through 
mountains of blackened rubble to determine whether it was a frayed wire or a 
Molotov cocktail that was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
With much of the evidence reduced to ashes -- and most such fires occurring in 
the dark of night, without witnesses -- the most arson investigators can 
generally hope for is a singed fingerprint, a bit of genetic material or the 
charred remains of a gasoline can that can be directly linked to a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the science of determining arson has advanced significantly. 
When a major fire occurs now, the city's arson squad is assisted by a high-tech 
mobile unit operated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The 
lab on wheels serves as headquarters for four specially trained chemists and 
explosives technicians who sift through rubble in search of characteristic burn 
patterns and residues left from incendiary materials. With its increasingly 
sophisticated equipment and resources, the city's arson squad usually can 
determine what caused a blaze in anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But the trail frequently ends there. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have proved that a fire is of incendiary origin, then you have the 
task of tying it to someone," explained Calvin E. Wells, an instructor in arson 
science and chief fire investigator for the Pasadena Fire Department. "That 
takes us into the area of motivation, and that is where the confusion starts." 
</P>
<P>
In arson, the motives are often far less recognizable than in many other major 
crimes. Fires are deliberately set for spite, for profit, for juvenile thrills 
or to cover up other crimes such as burglary or murder. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years in Los Angeles, no arrests have been made in several cause 
celebre arson cases. Two examples: the Westwood condominium blaze last month 
and the Wilshire District office tower fire last March that severely damaged 
the state Department of Savings and Loan headquarters 
</P>
<P>
In several other high-publicity Los Angeles cases, arrests were made, only to 
have the suspects freed within days. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example is what happened to Harry Peak, the garrulous unemployed actor 
arrested by the city arson team as the culprit in the 1986 Los Angeles Public 
Library fire. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Peak, who reportedly had given conflicting stories about his 
presence at the fire to friends, was publicly identified by Fire Battalion 
Chief Dean Cathey as "the perpetrator." But three days later, Peak was freed 
when the district attorney's office, citing a lack of sufficient evidence, 
declined to prosecute the 28-year-old Hollywood man. 
</P>
<P>
After Peak was let go, recriminations flew. 
</P>
<P>
Cathey continued to insist that Peak had set the $22-million blaze. But Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Stephen Kay, concerned that his office was receiving a black eye 
from the Fire Department, told reporters that the arson investigators arrested 
Peak as "a last straw" in the hope that he would break down and confess to the 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us that their investigation had reached a dead end," Kay said, "that 
they didn't have enough evidence to file a case." 
</P>
<P>
Peak, who called a lawyer rather than confessing, has since filed a $15-million 
lawsuit against fire officials for false arrest and slander. The city, 
meanwhile, has filed a $23-million cross-complaint against Peak, insisting that 
he was still considered responsible for the devastating blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pan Pacific Auditorium fire last year, a transient was picked up and 
declared the arsonist. But he too was released due to a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In declining the case, the district attorney's office accused fire 
investigators of "jumping the gun." Fire officials, meanwhile, blamed the staff 
of politically embattled Mayor Tom Bradley for pressuring them to go forward 
with a hastily scheduled press conference to announce that the case had been 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
"If he says he did it and he is in good shape mentally, that's probably enough 
information to arrest him," the suspect's attorney, Albert Gordon, reflected 
last week. "But if he says he did it and he's a fruitcake -- he's mentally ill 
-- you have to be very careful . . . you kind of investigate him further." 
</P>
<P>
Again last week, a transient was detained shortly after a suspicious fire 
destroyed a two-story condominium project under construction in the Los Feliz 
area. And again, the man was released a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the series of spurious arrests, senior arson investigator Cass said 
that fire officials have little choice but to follow whatever leads they have, 
even when they turn up transients or mentally unstable individuals. "It would 
be in error if you did not pursue that individual, detain that individual and 
find out as much as you could . . . and then make your decision." 
</P>
<P>
Cass also acknowledged that many arson cases, particularly those involving 
transients, are bound to make prosecutors more skittish than normal about 
filing charges. 
</P>
<P>
"That hesitancy is based on a lack of knowledge about the crime itself and 
maybe their not wanting to get involved in what could be a complex, 
circumstantial case," Cass said. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert E. Savitt, who 
specializes in arson prosecutions, admitted that arson cases often "frighten 
prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the reticence and reluctance of prosecutors to go to court when 
they don't have eyewitnesses to the actual fire or an admissible confession, if 
there is a confession," Savitt said. "Of course, if there is a confession, it's 
very simple." 
</P>
<P>
But Fire Department critics question whether the arson team has the manpower to 
adequately follow up most cases with the painstaking investigations necessary 
to capture and prosecute the right suspect. 
</P>
<P>
At times, investigators feel overwhelmed by the heavy caseload. "It's like a 
triage (medical) team deciding who lives and who dies," said one source 
familiar with the team's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, said Ahart of the arson investigators' association, the Los 
Angeles arson unit should be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
"How can 19 people cover 3 million people?" he asked. "I bleed for the guys who 
are arson investigators in Los Angeles."

TROOPS, MILITANTS CLASH IN CAPITAL OF SOVIET AZERBAIJAN; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC STRIFE: GORBACHEV SAYS HE ORDERED THE ARMY INTO BAKU TO AVOID AN 'ABYSS 
OF CHAOS AND SUFFERING.' THE DEATH TOLL IS AT LEAST 57.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Azerbaijani capital of Baku echoed with gunfire Saturday as Soviet army 
troops, who entered the city by force before dawn, fought skirmishes throughout 
the day with Muslim militants near a military barracks and fired over the heads 
of citizens who clustered in the city's center to exchange news, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a solemn nationwide address, said the 
country's leadership was compelled to order the army to use force to end the 
actions of extremists who were "dragging the people into an abyss of chaos and 
suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the tanks and soldiers who smashed through human blockades 
surrounding Baku were "met with fire from terrorists in some places. They had 
no choice but to fire back. There were casualties. Some families will miss 
their relatives. For this, I express deep condolences." 
</P>
<P>
The death toll from Saturday's fighting in Baku, a Caspian Sea oil port of 1.8 
million, remained uncertain. The Interior Ministry reported 51 Azerbaijanis and 
six soldiers killed; the mayor's office in Baku reported at least 60 dead, and 
nationalist Popular Front spokesmen said that more than 200 had been killed. 
The Interior Ministry also reported that 287 civilians and 36 soldiers were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"The street is covered with blood," Vadim Korsh, an editor of Azerbaijan's 
official news agency, Azerinform, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The morgues are overflowing, and the hospitals are jammed with wounded," 
Popular Front spokesman Abalyas Mamedov said in a separate interview from Baku. 
</P>
<P>
The main Soviet television evening news program, Vremya, broadcast an unusual 
appeal from Russian Orthodox Patriarch Pimen for an end to the killing of women 
and children and increased tolerance on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The republic's Communist Party leadership declared three days of official 
mourning for those killed. At the same time, the Kremlin imposed an indefinite 
state of emergency on Baku, enforcing a nighttime curfew on the city and 
banning all gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin almost immediately felt the first reverberation from its decision 
to clamp down in the capital of the mostly Shiite Muslim republic. In 
solidarity, the legislature of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, where 
Muslims also live, voted to secede from the Soviet Union and asked for support 
from Iran and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow hesitated a week before using force, reportedly in part in fear of 
inflaming passions among the country's 50 million Muslims, who make up the 
majority in six of the country's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
The army action came after Azerbaijani militants expelled thousands of 
Christian Armenians from their Baku homes, beating and killing dozens, and as 
Azerbaijanis were involved in fierce guerrilla fighting with neighboring Soviet 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Baku residents blocked Soviet troops from patrolling the city for 
three days before the soldiers broke through the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
The Popular Front increasingly had been asserting its power in the southern 
republic's capital in recent days. Tens of thousands of people had demanded in 
rallies in front of Communist Party headquarters that the republican government 
resign, that Soviet power end and that Azerbaijan be established as an Islamic 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We attempted to act in a patient and balanced way, trying to solve difficult 
problems by exclusively peaceful, political means . . . to find a way out of 
this dark alley," a grim-faced Gorbachev said in his 12-minute address to the 
nation. "We based our actions on the belief that violence will poison the 
situation even more and lead to more human victims. 
</P>
<P>
"But the people did not demonstrate the required responsibility and reason. . . 
. They didn't make a secret of their goal of seizing power," he said. "This had 
to stop." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet army troops are now in control of all key posts in the city 
"and are taking resolute measures against the pogrom organizers and instigators 
of violence. Weapons and ammunition are being confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be provoked by extremists," he said in a last appeal to the Baku 
population. "I deeply believe reason and wisdom will take over." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Baku said the city was tense Saturday. Although virtually all 
residents reportedly obeyed the curfew and emptied the streets at nightfall, 
guerrilla-like attacks against troops continued throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is dangerous and frightening," Aitekin Imranova, a spokeswoman 
for the Popular Front, said in a telephone interview from Baku at nightfall. 
"Troops are posted every five feet, and there are tanks, armored personnel 
carriers and military vehicles everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
As neither television nor radio were working, she said, people were clustering 
in the streets to try to exchange news. "But, whenever a group of people forms, 
the soldiers fire above their heads to disperse them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes also continued throughout the day at the military barracks on 
Salyansky Street, with Azerbaijanis and Soviet troops exchanging sporadic 
gunfire, she said. On Friday, Soviet troops were trapped in those barracks by 
crowds of Azerbaijani militants who barred them from entering the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said nationalists in Baku were "setting 
up new barriers made up of trucks and buses, and are opening fire in some 
places." 
</P>
<P>
"The streets of the city are jammed with armored personnel carriers. The 
squares are cordoned off by soldiers. Tension remains very, very high," a Radio 
Moscow correspondent reported from Baku. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many mourning flags in the streets. Cars are draped with black 
ribbons. Ships in the Caspian shipyards and in Baku Bay are sounding long, loud 
blasts on their horns," the correspondent said. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's Communist Party chief, Abdul-Rahman Vezirov, was dismissed after 
troops and tanks shot their way into Baku, Tass said, adding that government 
and party leaders were on their way to Moscow for urgent talks. 
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku, but attacks against 
those who remain were continuing, with 43 Armenian homes ransacked in the last 
24 hours, Tass reported Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether attacks against Armenians took place even as the army 
struggled to regain control of the city. Foreign journalists have not been 
permitted into Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between rival nationalists continued elsewhere in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan and in the Azerbaijani-controlled region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which 
has been at the heart of the dispute between the two peoples since Armenians 
began an effort two years ago to wrest control of the mostly Armenian-populated 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
In Armenia, nationalists from both ethnic groups carried out separate raids 
against army posts, confiscating 190 weapons over a 24-hour period, Tass 
reported Saturday evening. The government has said that extremists on both 
sides are armed with stolen helicopters, tanks and even missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In a clash in the Armenian border region of Ararat, two people were killed and 
20 wounded, including one soldier, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency also reported without details that 100 Iranian police officers 
are in Azerbaijan. Soviet authorities have accused Azerbaijanis of going into 
Iran and returning with weapons used in the last week's battles against both 
Armenians and Soviet soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Before February, 1988, about 500,000 Armenians lived in Azerbaijan, including 
200,000 in Baku. But after 32 Armenians were killed in a clash over the future 
of Nagorno-Karabakh, 217,000 Armenians fled to Armenia and about 150,000 
Azerbaijanis, practically the entire Armenian-based community, moved from 
Armenia to Azerbaijan.

MEDIA SKEPTICISM GREW AS MCMARTIN CASE LINGERED; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mike Wallace wanted to interview Ray Buckey for "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Davis, Buckey's attorney, had instructed his client to refuse all 
interview requests since he'd been arrested almost three years earlier. But 
Davis said yes to Wallace. The prestige and exposure of the "60 Minutes" forum 
was too great to resist, especially at a time when Davis had concluded that the 
public might finally be ready to take a more "rational" look at the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation case than it had previously. 
</P>
<P>
"We had passed what I considered to be the hysteria of classic witch hunts," 
Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace's interview with Buckey (and five of the six other original McMartin 
defendants) was broadcast on Nov. 2, 1986. Although Wallace and his producer, 
Lowell Bergman, have insisted that their story was balanced and fair, it 
actually provided "the defense's most compassionate argument to date," as Ray 
Richmond wrote in the Herald Examiner at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond called the "60 Minutes" story "card-stacking at its most shameless." 
</P>
<P>
Even Davis said, happily, that the program was "one-sided . . . wholly 
sympathetic to the defense point of view." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were very gentle on him (Buckey). . . . . Mike Wallace didn't 
go after him," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace and "60 Minutes" enjoy being controversial and iconoclastic, but by 
late1986, they weren't alone in their skepticism about the McMartin case The 
district attorney had dismissed all charges against five of the seven original 
defendants 10 months earlier, and several other events had combined to arouse 
skepticism among many reporters covering the case -- even those initially 
convinced that all the defendants were guilty. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon, of course, for some in the media to develop a contrarian 
view on any major story after a time, if only out of boredom or annoyance with 
the conventional wisdom -- or a desire to break from the pack. But a 
three-month Times investigation of McMartin coverage, completed before the 
verdicts were announced Thursday, shows that there was more involved in the 
growing McMartin skepticism than just the predictable next step in normal 
big-event coverage. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, this story had dragged on so long that reporters were eager for 
a new angle; others may have felt guilty about their early lack of skepticism 
and may have been eager to redeem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
More important, several reporters say they began to seriously question the 
legitimacy of the prosecution's case once they had actually interviewed one or 
more of the original defendants face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Becker of KCBS-TV and Norma Meyer, then with the Daily Breeze and now with 
Copley News Service, both said they thought defendants Betty Raidor and Mary 
Ann Jackson were innocent after interviewing them. Jess Marlow, then with KCBS 
and now with KNBC, says he felt the same way after interviewing Peggy Ann 
Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
That raised questions in reporters' minds about the guilt of other defendants 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread journalistic skepticism developed more gradually, though, as events 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Several of these events came during the preliminary hearing, which ran from 
mid-1984 until early 1986. The testimony of the children on several bizarre 
allegations -- Satanic rituals, animal sacrifices, visits to a cemetery, 
molestations in a car wash and a market -- raised many journalistic eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestion of Guilt 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the case, reports of such charges -- the more bizarre the 
better -- seemed to suggest that the defendants must be guilty; after all, who 
could (or would) invent such wild fantasies? By the end of the preliminary 
hearing, reports of these charges -- which had become even more bizarre -- 
seemed to suggest that the defendants must be innocent; after all, who could 
believe such wild fantasies? 
</P>
<P>
Reportorial doubts were also aroused by the courtroom playing of taped 
interviews during which the children's original accusations often seemed to be 
made in response to leading and suggestive questions asked by social workers at 
Children's Institute International. (As it turned out, those interviews played 
perhaps the major role in influencing the jurors to acquit the final two 
defendants.) 
</P>
<P>
Disclosures about the hurried, inadequate early investigation of the case under 
then-Dist. Atty. Robert H. Philibosian, combined with the failure of the 
prosecution to produce a "smoking gun," elicited even more doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always assumed the smoking gun would be a photo," Marlow says. "Porno gets 
passed around." 
</P>
<P>
But the preliminary hearing produced no photos, none of the secret tunnels or 
doors or rooms the children had mentioned, no adult witnesses who saw a child 
being molested, no defendant willing to condemn the others in exchange for 
leniency or immunity -- no irrefutable evidence of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the coverage take a definite turn . . . toward the end" of the 
preliminary hearing, says Faye Fiore, who covered the hearing for the Daily 
Breeze and now works for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in September, 1985, Fiore herself dropped a bombshell. She wrote that two 
of the three McMartin prosecutors thought charges should be dropped against 
five of the seven original defendants. Four months later, Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner -- who had defeated Philibosian at the polls -- did just that. 
</P>
<P>
"Reiner's decision . . . certainly was a turning point," says Gregory Mooney, 
an attorney who represented many McMartin parents in some legal proceedings. 
"Coverage started to get progressively negative" toward the prosecution after 
that, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, parents and their other supporters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Time magazine described the various charges in the case, then raised the 
"chilling possibility . . . that none of it had happened at all." Newsweek said 
that, "increasingly, there have been questions whether the . . . case was 
anything more than a series of sensational headlines." 
</P>
<P>
Most local newspaper and television coverage was less judgmental than that, but 
skepticism was clearly afoot. Reporters who decided that most (or all) of the 
McMartin defendants were innocent insist they did not let their new views 
unfairly influence their stories; it just seemed that way to the prosecution, 
they say, because the prosecution was accustomed to having the media report its 
side, virtually unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Magazine 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, a reading of the coverage tends to confirm that view. But 
there were a number of exceptions, one of the most notable being a story in Los 
Angeles magazine last October. 
</P>
<P>
The story was written by Mary A. Fischer, who -- 10 months earlier, in the same 
magazine -- had been the first to chronicle the media's growing skepticism 
about the case. Her basic thesis in the second article was that all the 
McMartin defendants were innocent, that the charges had been "trumped up," that 
"there never was any case at all." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer says she knows "for sure" that there were no molestations at McMartin. 
She has written about the case for at least five publications and discussed it 
on television; it's clear that vindication of the defendants became something 
of a crusade for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that most reporters on this case believe the defendants to be 
innocent," Fischer says, "but they are hamstrung by the conventions, the 
techniques of accepted journalism practices. . . . For the sake of balance -- 
get the defense side, get the prosecution side -- the truth wasn't getting out. 
I wanted to risk the loss of some balance to get the truth out." 
</P>
<P>
(In the process of getting "the truth" out, Fischer violated one of Judge 
William Pounders' primary concerns throughout the trial -- safeguarding the 
privacy of the McMartin children. Although various media had inadvertently 
mentioned one or two of the children by his or her real first name -- instead 
of "John Doe" or "Jane Doe," as was usually the practice -- Fischer's story was 
accompanied by a chart that gave the first names of all 11 children involved in 
the trial; between the chart and the story, there was enough information to 
identify one child's last name as well.) 
</P>
<P>
As Fischer says, many other reporters did indeed come to believe that the 
defendants were innocent, and that was sometimes evident in their stories, too 
(although not nearly as evident or as widespread as reporters' earlier feelings 
that the defendants were guilty). 
</P>
<P>
Most reporters who covered the case on a daily basis said in interviews several 
weeks before the verdicts came in that if the press corps were the jury, the 
defendants would not be convicted. Virtually all said they thought Peggy 
McMartin Buckey was not guilty, and most thought Ray Buckey not guilty either. 
</P>
<P>
This marked quite a turnaround from the early weeks and months of the case, 
when the media covered the case with "an absolute presumption of guilt" for all 
seven original defendants, in the words of Nancy Hill-Holtzman, who covered 
much of McMartin for the Herald Examiner and now works for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, it must be pointed out that there were a few -- not many, but a 
few -- attempts to treat the defendants as human beings, not monsters, early 
on. 
</P>
<P>
The Herald Examiner, for example, published a lengthy excerpt from Virginia 
McMartin's diary seven weeks after the case broke and published brief profiles 
on the defendants a month after that. The Herald Examiner editorial page was in 
the vanguard of the skeptics, raising questions as early as December, 1984, in 
an editorial headlined "A modern witch hunt?" (The Herald contributed its share 
to the hysteria and made its share of errors, too; the paper even misspelled 
the name of the judge in the preliminary hearing eight times in two weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
A week after the Herald Examiner profiles, The Times published a lengthy Page 1 
story on the defendants, based on interviews with 60 of their friends, 
relatives, acquaintances and attorneys. The picture that emerged from those 
interviews, the story said, was of "a group of people who shared not only a 
love of children but a morality that went beyond once-a-week churchgoing." 
</P>
<P>
Once the initial hysteria began to give way to more sober reporting, two other 
newspapers -- both in the South Bay area -- frequently provided noteworthy 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Breeze, based in Torrance, is the local daily newspaper for those 
most directly involved in the McMartin case, so it is no surprise that the 
Breeze has published more than 700 stories on the case over the last six years, 
more than any other publication. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the Breeze had been as caught up in the early hysteria as the rest of 
the media, displaying no skepticism about the sweeping nature of the charges 
and publishing the names of uncharged suspects. In addition, the Breeze 
published two stories by Faye Fiore on its front page in March, 1985, under the 
headline "In Search of Satan"; the stories linked McMartin (and other child 
molestation cases) to widespread satanic rituals and devil worship -- charges 
never proved. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Meyer, who covered the first six months of the case for the Breeze (and 
the last six months for Copley News Service), includes her own stories in her 
criticism that the press generally "became mouthpieces for the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
But Forrest Latiner, the deputy public defender who represented 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Ann Buckey until all charges against her were dropped, says it was Fiore 
who "first began to sense there was something not quite kosher about what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
As a defense attorney, Latiner would be expected to praise a reporter whom the 
prosecution accuses of having been biased against them. Even Danny Davis, Ray 
Buckey's attorney, says Fiore "wrote stories sympathetic to our side." Many 
McMartin parents and their supporters agreed; they picketed the Breeze in 
December, 1984, to protest the paper's "pro-defense" coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In one story, Fiore wrote that "many reporters" saw continuing charges by 
parents of widespread child molestations in the South Bay as "one of several 
desperate attempts to keep alive in the media allegations that have died in the 
courtroom" -- a premature judgment at best since the preliminary hearing wasn't 
even over yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Faye propagandized a fair amount," says Wayne Satz, who broke the 
first McMartin story on KABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Fiore concedes that she came to believe "the case . . . has no foundation," but 
she insists her reporting remained fair and evenhanded. Several other reporters 
on the case -- including Marcia Chambers, who covered parts of the case for the 
New York Times -- praise Fiore's work on McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
"Faye Fiore is a very good reporter," Chambers says. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants' Side Told 
</P>
<P>
Good or biased -- or a bit of both -- it's clear that Fiore's skepticism led 
her to write some of the earliest stories giving the defendants' side of the 
case. One of these, a Page 1 story published on Sept. 7, 1984 -- seven months 
after the case broke in the news but 2 1/2 years before the trial would begin 
-- asked whether it was possible for the defendants to receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"In one sense," Fiore wrote, the teachers had "already been tried; the media 
were their courtroom, the public their jury and guilty is the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Fiore quoted several of the defendants and their attorneys at length and spoke 
of the threats, ostracism and deprivation they had endured -- including lengthy 
imprisonment without bail, "a constitutional right more commonly revoked in 
death penalty cases." 
</P>
<P>
Fiore and other Breeze reporters wrote more stories from the defendants' 
perspective than reporters for any other daily paper, and that helped 
contribute to the impression in many quarters that they and their paper became 
biased in favor of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeze published early interviews with several of the defendants; a profile 
of Ray Buckey; stories showing the devastating financial and emotional toll the 
case had taken on the defendants, and a story on attempts by various political 
candidates to exploit the case for their electoral advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeze also published several major exclusives on McMartin, including one 
disclosing that the district attorney's office had interviewed only one-third 
of the children before filing charges and another -- one of the biggest stories 
in the entire case -- revealing that two McMartin prosecutors had doubts about 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unlike most of the media, the Breeze often followed its stories on 
various prosecution charges with stories that showed when those charges had not 
been substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the media carried stories in early March, 1984, for example, saying 
that authorities armed with search warrants had visited 11 locations in three 
counties, looking for evidence linking the McMartin school to a child 
pornography ring. But the Breeze was the only news organization among the major 
players on McMartin that published a story the next day saying no such evidence 
had been found. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, while most of the media published and broadcast allegations that 
children at McMartin and the Manhattan Ranch Pre-School had been swapped for 
purposes of molestation, it was the Breeze that subsequently reported the 
courtroom exchange in which it was conceded that there was no evidence of a 
connection between the molestation cases at the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
Such stories were favorable to the defense, of course, and it could be argued 
that that's why the Breeze published them. But they were legitimate stories, 
and the reporters deny any bias. 
</P>
<P>
Provocative Stories 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the most interesting -- certainly the most provocative -- 
coverage of the McMartin case has come not in a mainstream daily newspaper but 
in an alternative weekly, the Easy Reader, in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Early stories in the Easy Reader were so strident in their presumption of guilt 
that Kevin Cody, the 40-year-old publisher of the paper, was besieged by angry 
friends of the defendants, demanding that he do something about John Jackson, 
the reporter/columnist covering the case. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Kevin, you've lived in this town for 15 years. How could you 
possibly think that they were running trainloads of molested kids in and out of 
that school?' " Cody recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Cody's response was that Jackson was "the best reporter I've ever had, and he's 
doing a great job . . . as far as I know." 
</P>
<P>
But when Jackson left the paper, and Cody began covering the case himself, he 
came to believe that the prosecution didn't have "any case whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Given that view -- and the very nature of alternative newspapers -- it 
shouldn't have shocked anyone that Cody's stories began to take a very 
critical, at times crusading, look at the prosecution's case. Cody even went so 
far as to compare Ray Buckey with Alfred Dreyfus, the French army officer 
wrongfully convicted of treason and imprisoned on Devil's Island in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
But Cody also wrote a number of balanced, insightful stories -- including the 
most detailed profile of Buckey and the best coverage in any publication of the 
complex, controversial, contradictory medical testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The medical testimony was the only real evidence in the case apart from the 
children's testimony, but for most of it, no reporters were even in the 
courtroom. In fact, the courtroom was often empty of reporters at several 
stages of the trial; reporters -- and their editors -- seemingly grew weary of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Cody probably spent more time in the courtroom during the trial than any other 
reporter, though, sitting in the last row of the spectator section, taking 
notes on his small, laptop computer, and many journalists -- among them, Satz 
of KABC and Furnell Chatman of KNBC -- praise his coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Satz, who is widely perceived as having been pro-prosecution in his own 
coverage (a charge he vigorously denies), says Cody provided the "most 
thoroughgoing and careful observation of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to be fair in an exemplary way and, to a significant extent, he's 
succeeded," his "pro-defense tilt" notwithstanding, Satz says. 
</P>
<P>
Both Satz and Chatman say Cody's coverage is particularly noteworthy given the 
relatively meager resources of his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, however, some of the best individual stories on McMartin appeared in 
media far from Southern California. Perhaps that's because publications outside 
the area, not burdened with having to cover the story virtually every day, had 
more perspective. Equally telling, most of the best McMartin stories were 
published relatively late in the case -- perhaps, several local reporters 
suggest, because editors outside Southern California were neither too tired of 
the daily drone of McMartin coverage over the years nor too embarrassed by 
their early coverage to consider a fresh approach late in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, both Superior Court Judge William Pounders and former Dist. Atty. 
Philibosian praise, in particular, Robert Safian's 8,400-word McMartin story 
that appeared last October in the American Lawyer, a New York-based magazine. 
Safian used the context of 10 days during the trial to sum up and analyze the 
entire case in an evenhanded but compelling manner. The story concluded by 
saying that, regardless of the verdict, "the McMartin mystery will remain." 
</P>
<P>
"How could so many children be sexually abused for so long without anyone 
noticing? On the other hand, how could so many children be convinced that such 
terrible things had happened to them if they hadn't? There are too many 
inconsistencies in the prosecution's case not to provide lingering doubts. Yet 
there is too much conviction and horror in the children's stories of abuse not 
to look askance at Ray Buckey. The true believers of either side will hold 
firm, and make powerful arguments with compelling evidence. The rest of us will 
have to wonder." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Gorney of the Washington Post spent three months putting together a 
comprehensive, moving, two-part series on the case in the spring of 1988; when 
she was done, she, too, was still wondering. 
</P>
<P>
Gorney ultimately decided that "something real and scary" had happened to the 
McMartin children; she generally agreed with one of three theories she 
presented in her story -- that "some children were molested in Manhattan Beach, 
molested by preschool teachers or by others, and . . . the disclosing and 
spreading of those children's reports took place in an atmosphere of such 
uncontainable and self-feeding alarm that both children and the adults 
listening to them lost the capacity to sort the imagined from the actual." 
</P>
<P>
A Quagmire 
</P>
<P>
But Gorney said that almost any development in the case would not surprise her, 
and she called the McMartin story "a bigger enigma and a bigger quagmire than 
anything any reporter I know has ever gotten into. You lose any sense of what's 
real and what's not real. You become . . . disoriented and bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
"I never in my life . . . wanted to get so far from a case as I did from that 
one," she says. "I was a basket case while I was doing this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Downing of the Memphis Commercial Appeal said much the same thing after 
she and Tom Charlier spent seven months researching and writing a six-part 
series, later reprinted in a 26-page special section, analyzing 
child-molestation cases from Memphis to McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the worst story I've ever had to work on," Downing says. 
"Neither of us has wanted to write anything else on the subject since then." 
</P>
<P>
The series Downing and Charlier produced -- titled "Justice Abused: A 1980s 
Witch-Hunt" -- was among the most skeptical in any mainstream publication. They 
pointed out, among many other things, the large number of child molestation 
cases that had resulted in dismissals, acquittals and dropped charges and the 
startling number of similarities among many of the cases. Children in both the 
Memphis and McMartin cases, for example, told of druggings, of animal 
mutilations, of trips in vans, of bloody rituals, of sacrifices of babies and 
of being taken on airplanes that resembled those of Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
Downing says she had written about child sexual abuse before this series and "I 
really believe that the issue of child sexual abuse is a serious issue, that 
children are abused, that horrible things happen, that we have not only a right 
but an obligation to try to protect children." But she came to believe that 
media coverage of many of these cases had thoroughly "contaminated" the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
As good as all of these stories were, they were exceptions. No local media did 
enterprise stories on McMartin of the depth and breadth provided by the Memphis 
series, the American Lawyer article or Gorney's Washington Post articles. Nor 
did the local media, with rare exception, do the stories it traditionally does 
on an event like McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
On some big stories, there isn't time for anything more than routine daily 
coverage and maybe an occasional analysis or human-interest feature. But 
McMartin dragged on for six years, often with little new happening for weeks at 
a time, and still the media seldom stepped back to take a comprehensive view or 
to write in broad terms about some of the major issues and individuals in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Institute International originally said 369 children were molested 
at McMartin. Only 41 testified before the grand jury, and only nine testified 
at the trial. What happened to the other 300-plus children. Were they 
traumatized? In therapy? In another preschool? Did any recant? 
</P>
<P>
Stories on these questions were hard to find. Nor were there many profiles of 
the principal players in the case -- the judge and the lead attorneys. A search 
of media files before the verdicts wouldn't turn up much on the crucial 
behind-the-scenes role played by screenwriter Abby Mann and his wife Myra 
either. 
</P>
<P>
The Manns first interested "60 Minutes" in the case -- most of the interviews 
for the 1986 program were filmed in the Manns' living room -- and they made a 
book and movie deal with Glenn Stevens, the former deputy district attorney who 
left his job under fire after he told reporters of his doubts about the 
prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
The tape-recorded interviews in which Stevens told the Manns of his misgivings 
about the case and in which he accused his former colleagues of prosecutorial 
misconduct became a major controversy during pretrial maneuvering in the case. 
As usual, the press covered the controversy. But the Manns were little more 
than an afterthought. 
</P>

story.

COMMITMENT OF YOUTH KEY TO EAST EUROPE UPHEAVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES T. POWERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Palace Square, construction cranes tug at the wreckage left by the 
battle that attended dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's flight from power. At midday, 
crowds of people, in from the countryside, walk slowly through the square, 
looking open-mouthed at the charred and bullet-chipped masonry, appreciating 
for the first time the ferocity of the fight that took place here. 
</P>
<P>
Then they stop by the rows of candles set out before the heaps of dirty snow 
piled at the edges of the square. These are the shrines to the dead, and the 
candles have been burning solidly for two weeks now. The elderly women, pausing 
to gaze at the puddles of molten wax and the sputtering wicks of the candles, 
often begin to cry. They cry, they say, for the youth, "the youth who saved 
us." 
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen such places in Bucharest, and possibly hundreds in other 
cities across the country. On two of the main traffic circles in Bucharest, 
University Plaza and the Plaza Romania, great wooden crosses are surrounded by 
a sea of flickering candles and thousands of wilted flowers, marking the places 
where hundreds were cut down by sniper fire from the dictator's elite security 
force. 
</P>
<P>
As all Romanians readily acknowledge, the overwhelming majority of those who 
died to sweep the Ceausescu regime from power were young people. The courage of 
the Romanian youth, braving bullets to win freedom, was unique in a year of 
sweeping change in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But the special determination of the Romanian young people was, in fact, a 
forceful reminder of the role played throughout the East Bloc by a new 
generation whose bravery, desperation and impatience became a vital catalytic 
force in the political revolution that is now changing the face of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in Romania and the other countries of Eastern Europe in the last 
year amounts to a sharp generational break between youth and a parental 
generation that came to maturity in the Communist world at a time either when 
there was greater hope for communism as a workable system or when the coercive 
forces of the state brooked no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Where parents, by and large, made their uneasy truce with life under communism 
and got on with life as best they could, a new generation saw only falsehood 
and hopelessness and decided it had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"We were raised on a mountain of lies," said Stefan Ghencea, 22, the son of a 
veterinarian, now helping to organize a student union at Bucharest Polytechnic. 
"There was a fantastic difference between the things they told us and the 
things we saw. They published incredible statistics on agriculture production, 
and in the shops there was nothing to eat. On paper, we had freedom of 
expression, but any time anyone said anything, members of the Communist Party 
told us to keep our mouths shut." 
</P>
<P>
The mountains of lies and oceans of doublespeak were as obvious to adults as to 
youth, of course; but youth, as youth does, saw it all in simpler terms. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a lot to lose," said Ghencea. "He had a job. He had a family. He 
had to take care of me. They could do nothing to me as a student. They could 
shoot me, of course, but when you are in a crowd, you lose your fear." 
</P>
<P>
Ghencea, like hundreds of thousands of other youths across the East Bloc in the 
last 12 months, had never faced bullets before. In Poland and Czechoslovakia 
and East Germany, they had periodically faced the clubs of riot police, but 
there were no reports of live ammunition being used. Unlike their parents, they 
did not remember the horrors of the Stalinist era in Eastern Europe, when 
resistance to communism was punished with prison, labor camps or even death at 
the hands of secret police inquisitors. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland in 1988, it was a band of young strikers -- too young to have 
participated in the strikes that gave birth to Solidarity in 1980 -- whose 
action led directly to the legalization of Solidarity and the ultimate 
formation of a government led by the free trade union movement. Lech Walesa, 
the veteran leader of the union, told the young strikers in the Lenin Shipyards 
in Gdansk in 1988 that their effort would probably fail. By last August, those 
same strikers could be credited with establishing the first non-Communist 
government in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval in East Germany and the fall of the Berlin Wall were triggered by 
an exodus of youth -- predominantly East Germans in their late teens and early 
twenties -- who had simply had enough of waiting and of empty promises. The 
thousands of East German refugees who piled into makeshift encampments, first 
in Hungary and then in Prague, resembled, like a kind of time warp, the 1968 
youth of Woodstock, the fuse of a political explosion. 
</P>
<P>
It was also youth who set off the 10 tumultuous days of demonstrations in 
Prague that brought down the hard-line Czechoslovak regime. There, when 
truncheon-wielding police waded into a crowd of students, brutally beating 
scores of them, the action galvanized the public. A demonstration by 15,000 
students led to crowds of 300,000 filling Wenceslas Square on a daily basis 
until the Communist government fell. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened because we created a different conception about life," said Sorin 
Ciobanu, 22, another student union organizer at the Bucharest Polytechnic. "We 
did not get stuck as our parents did. Our parents know much better than we did 
the system of the secret police, the information system of the Communist Party. 
They knew they could lose their jobs, that their family could suffer. 
</P>
<P>
My parents are teachers. They were party members. They did not agree (with the 
system), but they could not change it. They knew about their colleagues who, 
within two days of speaking out in some way, were fired from their jobs and 
could not work again as teachers. So they were careful. We understand this. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was different with us. It is true that we had much less to lose. We had 
only ourselves. Our parents had families and children to think of." 
</P>
<P>
Now the youth of Bucharest, like much of the rest of the country, are wrestling 
with new-found freedom, trying to organize associations and clubs to press 
their demands and concerns. They want a revised education system, youth 
organizations free of the old Communist concerns. They want to travel, to 
establish contacts with the outside world. They see themselves, in their recent 
past, as "the most oppressed" of all Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth were under an absurd yoke," said Ion Manea, who is helping to 
organize the newly formed Assn. of Romanian Youth. "In the schools, the 
students had no books. The classrooms were dark and unheated. And they could 
not express the smallest complaint. If young people wanted to go to college, 
they had to be a member of the party." 
</P>
<P>
Some now feel that the revolution, not yet a month old, has already been stolen 
from them. Dumitru Coriban, 23, a factory worker from Timisoara, the 
Transylvanian city where the revolution began on Dec. 16, fears that the old 
Establishment, trying to shed its Communist skin, is clinging to power however 
it can. There is a danger, he said, that the youth will be cut out of the 
Romanian revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth did not face the bullets to have flowers laid on our heads," Coriban 
said. "We did it for change, and we want to see change." 
</P>
<P>
The courage of the streets, the youths said, now has to be transformed into 
organization, into developing political skills. It is not easy to be faced with 
this challenge overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first days, we faced terrorists with arms," said Vilutza Virtejanu, a 
19-year-old student. "Now we are faced with terrorists with ideas, and they are 
much more dangerous. They are more adept than we are. They are from the old 
order, they feel the ground being cut from under them. It is happening 
everywhere now. The farther you get from Bucharest, the more acute the 
struggle. It is in every factory, every institution. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, we are in a new age. It is as though we have been in a cage. Now 
the door to the cage is open, and we are free to fly, but we don't yet know how 
to do it. We don't yet know how to fly. We don't know how to use the freedom we 
have won. We need people to be close to us and to help us, and we always need 
to remember why we did this."

The pundits say he's finished and the pollsters say he's plummeting, but what 
about the man on the street? 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, beleaguered by his entanglement in the Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan debacle, held a community forum in Norwalk on Saturday and guess 
which subject never came up? 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is the appropriate place for that," said Marsha Reed of 
Downey. "And I'm glad it didn't come up." 
</P>
<P>
That was the reaction of some others in the meeting, which was attended by 
about 100 people in Norwalk City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to get better informed on all issues," said Bill Vane of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
What they all wanted to talk about was the topic Cranston himself had chosen: 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
And although Cranston could control the first hour of the discussion and keep 
it off the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, he was an easy target for 
any questions on the matter during the last half hour, when those in the 
audience got their chance to speak. 
</P>
<P>
But that segment reflected the earlier one. In fact, what the senator witnessed 
was riveting, often emotional, testimony from civic leaders and average 
citizens who are determined to take their communities back from the gangs and 
drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need for more people in our community to get involved," said Richard Rios, 
a member of the panel that assisted Cranston. "People assume that somebody else 
will take care of the problem until suddenly it is on their doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
He and others said they were impressed that a U.S. senator would spend his 
Saturday morning with them. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age girl who is finally drug free after five hellish years pleaded to 
the adults present, "Get involved with your kids!" 
</P>
<P>
And Lee Baca, area commander for the Sheriff's Department, told the senator 
that Los Angeles County has become "the gang capital of the nation" because 
parents are not supervising their children. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who raised two sons, nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The senator seemed elated at the way the forum went. He scribbled notes, 
applauded after some of the testimony and asked numerous questions himself. 
</P>
<P>
For longtime Cranston-watchers, this was the signal that no matter how rough it 
gets for the senator in the Lincoln Savings matter, he will stick to his 
determination to run for a fifth term in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Although he began holding community forums after going to the Senate in 1969, 
he did not seriously turn to them until January, 1985. Preparing to run for 
reelection to the Senate in 1986, Cranston was considered extremely vulnerable 
because of his failed presidential campaign in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Cranston began to show up everywhere in California, soliciting the 
opinions of voters on major issues and using his clout to make civic leaders 
and experts available at the forums. 
</P>
<P>
But can a heavy schedule of forums over the next three years help Cranston 
reverse his sagging prospects? Political professionals think it will be a tall 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Some Californians who testified in Congress recently blamed Cranston personally 
for money they lost by investing in uninsured junk bonds that were sold by 
Lincoln Savings out of its branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
Almost overnight, Cranston's job rating plunged and even Democratic voters told 
pollsters they thought he should resign his seat or at the least not seek 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was one of five senators who met with federal regulators investigating 
certain practices of Lincoln Savings. The senators did so at the request of 
Lincoln Savings President Charles H. Keating, from whom they had received 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston insists he was simply trying to force action on a matter that had 
dragged on for years. 
</P>
<P>
But with the issue not even arising in Saturday's forum, and with some of those 
present professing little interest in it, Cranston may know something the 
pundits don't. 
</P>
<P>
Eve Nelson of Norwalk said the Lincoln Savings issue was "one of the factors 
we'll have to consider when we vote (in 1992) but it isn't the only one. You 
have to look at everything Cranston's done or not done."

DUMP SEWAGE DISPOSAL PLAN, LAUGHLIN, NEV., TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAUGHLIN, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the West's latest boom town. Seemingly overnight, Laughlin has 
metamorphosed from an unremarkable blip on the Colorado River to a thriving 
tourist mecca teeming with gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Only trouble is, visitors leave more than dollars behind when they hop in the 
RV and head for home; they also leave sewage. And if the high rollers are to 
continue answering nature's call between blackjack hands, a way must be found 
to dispose of the mounting volume of waste. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin has found a solution, but it is not going over real big with the 
town's downstream neighbors in Arizona and California. Sanitation officials in 
Nevada say the best answer to Laughlin's dilemma is to dump the 4 million 
gallons of sewage produced daily into the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters of the idea promise that a state-of-the-art plant will filter, 
chlorinate and cleanse the sewage to a point where it poses no threat to the 
fish, fowl and humans who use the waterway. Indeed, they pledge, the effluent 
coming out the tail end of the treatment plant will be cleaner than what is 
already in the river -- clean enough, they say, to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Such assurances, however, have failed to win the proposal many boosters 
downriver. Residents and elected leaders in the Arizona communities of Bullhead 
City, Lake Havasu City and Parker have attacked Laughlin's plan, calling it at 
best unneighborly and at worst an environmental sacrilege. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Arizona residents worry that a treatment breakdown could 
turn the river into a cesspool and scare off millions of tourists who flock to 
it to fish, swim and water ski each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The question I ask is this: If you're not going to protect the Colorado River 
now, then when?" said William Riley, an environmental planner with the Western 
Arizona Council of Governments. Laughlin officials "have alternatives, but 
they're taking the easy route. If we in Arizona treated our neighbors this 
shabbily, I'd be ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
At least two Indian tribes -- the Chemehuevis, who control 30 miles of Colorado 
River shoreline south of Needles in California, and the Colorado River Indians 
in Parker -- have echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, meanwhile, concerns have surfaced about the threat that 
the sewage could pose to the river's suitability as a drinking water source. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Southland residents receive 25% of their drinking water from the 
Colorado River; in some regions, like San Diego County, that proportion is much 
higher. The Metropolitan Water District, which provides drinking water for most 
of Southern California, has not formally opposed the discharge, even though its 
intake plant -- which pumps Colorado River water through a 242-mile-long 
aqueduct to a reservoir in Riverside -- is downstream of Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
But MWD officials have asked that Laughlin be required to screen its effluent 
for viruses and disease-causing parasites before dumping it in the river. So 
far, regulators in Nevada have rejected that suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"As you continue to increase discharges over time . . . you may reach a point 
where you put so many of these organisms into the (river) that you have the 
potential for a problem," said Ed Means, MWD's associate director of water 
quality. "Obviously, we're vitally concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin officials contend that the hostile reaction they have received is 
unfair. They note that other cities -- among them Needles and Las Vegas, which 
generates a far greater volume of sewage than Laughlin -- have been using the 
river as a sewage receptacle for years. Why, they argue, should Laughlin be 
chastised for seeking to do the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
"None of these opponents have given a valid, scientific reason why this 
shouldn't be done," said Richard Reavis, chief of permits and compliance with 
Nevada's water quality division. "It's the old 'not-in-my-back yard' syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Nevada authorities will decide whether to grant Laughlin's request 
for a discharge permit. Until then, debate over the proposal -- which has 
dominated conversations in the river communities like no other topic in years 
-- is expected to continue in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a group called Safe and Sane Sanitation in Parker has gathered 800 
signatures on petitions protesting the plan. The opinion pages of local 
newspapers are crowded with letters expressing outrage over the idea, many of 
them evoking images of polluted Boston Harbor to illustrate their point. 
</P>
<P>
And in Lake Havasu City -- a burgeoning hamlet heavily dependent on 
water-related tourism -- nervous civic leaders have sought help with the fight 
from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rep. Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) and Democratic Gov. 
Rose Mofford. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clamor, Reavis said he expects that the state will approve the 
permit and that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will then affirm the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
A bit of history helps explain the sewage disposal crisis gripping Laughlin. 
Located in the southeast corner of Nevada 95 miles from Las Vegas, the town for 
years was little more than a sleepy backwater, home to a couple of dingy 
casinos attracting only the most desperate of gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of its location -- perched beside a boater's paradise 300 miles 
from Los Angeles -- and comfy winter climate, Laughlin gradually worked its way 
onto the vacationer's map. Today the town is abuzz with activity, the noise of 
its busy slot machines muted only by the roar of the cranes and backhoes 
building still more high-rise casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin's gaming income has jumped 17% per quarter during the last year, 
propelling it past South Lake Tahoe into third place on Nevada's list of 
gambling revenue producers. By the end of 1990, Laughlin's 4,000 hotel rooms -- 
which are full 98% of the time -- will nearly triple. Another 12,000 rooms have 
been approved for construction. 
</P>
<P>
A new runway will soon permit commercial jets to land at the Bullhead City 
Airport across the river, and a waterfront golf course -- the city's first with 
18 holes -- will be completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
But with the growth have come problems, and the most vexing of these is sewage. 
Currently, effluent from the Clark County Sanitation District's Laughlin 
treatment plant is used to irrigate hayfields. But officials say high land 
prices and the growing volume of waste make that system impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Sanitation District wants to spend $28 million to expand its plant 
to an eventual capacity of 8 million gallons a day and upgrade its treatment 
system to meet the strict federal standards required of those discharging into 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the effluent produced by the sophisticated treatment system would 
have no ill effects on the river's water quality or wildlife. One enthusiastic 
supporter even compared the treated waste water to "a bottle of Perrier." 
</P>
<P>
District officials also say the facility's design incorporates several 
emergency backup systems -- including ponds that can hold up to 2 million 
gallons -- that provide extra insurance against the release of raw sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true belt-and-suspenders system," said Douglas Karafa, Laughlin 
utilities manager for the Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, argue that even the best mechanical systems can fail. And 
they say the risk of raw sewage fouling the clear blue waters of the Colorado 
is one they do not wish to take. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here in '69 because it's beautiful country and a nice place to 
retire," said Ed Hansen, a former Anaheim police officer who serves as Mohave 
County constable in Bullhead City. "I want that river blue, not brown." 
</P>
<P>
Other opponents say they have confidence in the technology but worry about the 
public relations effect of dumping sewage into a recreation paradise. Bob Lee, 
who owns a bait and tackle business in Lake Havasu City, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Who in their right mind would drive five hours from L.A. to swim or fish in a 
river they thought was full of sewage?" Lee asked. "I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Added John Parrott, Lake Havasu's top Chamber of Commerce official: "This may 
be the Rolls-Royce of treatment systems, but the public perception of treated 
sewage going into the river is dangerous, and we'll bear the burden of that." 
</P>
<P>
Still other foes of the sewage project criticize Laughlin for pressing ahead 
with river disposal even though alternatives appear to exist. A Las Vegas 
builder, for example, has offered to purchase 2 million gallons of effluent a 
day to irrigate a golf course development in Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the progress on water reclamation being made in the world today, we 
just don't understand why they're rushing ahead with this stupid idea," said 
Bob Lawrence, chairman of the Buckskin Sanitary District board of directors in 
Parker Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada officials dismiss other disposal options as unreliable or inappropriate 
for the volume of sewage Laughlin generates. And they contend it makes little 
sense to gripe about Laughlin's plans when Las Vegas already discharges 80 
million gallons of treated sewage into the river each day. Since the 1940s, 
effluent from Las Vegas has been funneled into a natural wash that carries it 
11 miles into Lake Mead, which is part of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents counter that they are by no means pleased with the way Las Vegas 
handles its waste and hope one day to halt all sewage flows into the river. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working to turn it around," Lawrence said. "That's why what's happening 
at Laughlin is such a giant step backward." 
</P>
<P>
In pushing their project, Laughlin officials note that they will win a special 
jackpot for pouring waste water into the Colorado -- specifically, the right to 
take an equal amount of fresh water back out. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "law of the river" -- a complex set of legal documents 
governing the allocation of river water among the states -- Nevada gets 300,000 
acre-feet of water annually, which is then divided among various communities. 
But if a city returns water -- even treated sewage -- to the river, the law 
regards that as "credit" allowing for greater withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're only allocated 10,000 acre-feet a year, and that's putting 
the limits on our growth," said Ted Finneran of the Laughlin Chamber of 
Commerce. "But if we can clean up this sewer water with our Space Age treatment 
plant and put it back in the river, we'll get more out. 
</P>
<P>
"And that sounds pretty good to us."

An 18-year-old man was arrested Saturday and charged with slashing actress 
Viveca Lindfors and a second person with a razor last weekend. He had been 
drinking and had taken LSD, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Peter Bedford, was arrested at a friend's house in Brooklyn after 
police received an anonymous tip, said Manhattan Chief of Detectives Ronald 
Fenrich. 
</P>
<P>
Bedford was charged with two counts of assault and one count of criminal 
possession of a deadly weapon, Fenrich said. The razor allegedly used in the 
attacks was not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Bedford is accused of slashing Lindfors, 69, and Dennis Beal, 36, on the face 
and head in separate incidents in Greenwich Village. The attacks occurred about 
3 blocks and five minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims said they were accosted by a gang of young people and one member 
of the gang did the slashing. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish-born Lindfors, who appeared in the movie "The Way We Were," needed 
27 stitches after the attack. Beal required 40 stitches to close his wound.

AIDES URGE BARRY AGAINST REELECTION BID; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: FOLLOWING HIS COCAINE ARREST, THE MAYOR REPORTEDLY AGREES WITH HIS TOP 
ADVISERS. BUT SOURCES SAY HE HAS NOT INDICATED ANY WILLINGNESS TO RESIGN.

<P>
Mayor Marion Barry, reeling from his arrest on a federal drug charge, has been 
strongly urged by top political aides to abandon his reelection bid and has at 
least tentatively accepted that suggestion, those advisers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
One adviser said that Barry has been convinced of the futility of running for 
reelection in a city plagued by drug abuse and drug-related homicides. 
</P>
<P>
"He is resigned to it," said one adviser, who urged the mayor to scuttle his 
reelection effort during a tense two-hour session Friday and in a strategy 
meeting later. "It is a foregone conclusion, and the mood in there was like 
that of an Irish wake." 
</P>
<P>
The adviser said he was uncertain when Barry's decision would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's reelection announcement, which had been scheduled for today, "was 
postponed, obviously," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that postponement will just go and go and go indefinitely," the aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who was arraigned in federal court Friday on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge, has already turned over the running of his government to a 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The Barry adviser, who spoke only on the condition that he not be named, said 
he is confident that the mayor will honor his pledge to drop plans for a fourth 
four-year term in November. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barry has frequently changed his mind on city issues without informing 
his aides, particularly on budget matters, after first having agreed to accept 
another course of action. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is willing to go back on minor decisions involving the day-to-day 
operations of the government, he could certainly do so here," said a longtime 
associate of the mayor's. "But when he has time to reflect on this, he will 
realize that there really is no way he can run again. The decision he 
apparently reached Friday is one that eventually he will have to honor, even if 
he tries first to go back on it." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Barry does not run for reelection, he has not yet indicated any 
willingness to resign, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't talked about whether he will resign yet," said one adviser who 
participated in Friday's meeting. "These things will all be dealt with, in 
time, but the immediate concern was making a change for now." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gildenhorn, a fund-raiser for the mayor who participated in Friday's 
meeting, stopped short of saying Barry had agreed not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very trying times, and we want to direct the mayor in the right 
direction," Gildenhorn said. "At this point, we have suggested that the mayor 
re-evaluate his position, and . . . we want him to be thinking clearly and 
lucidly." 
</P>
<P>
Delano Lewis, president of the local Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. and 
a longtime Barry associate, attended Friday's meeting but would not comment on 
the mayor's reaction to the group's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lewis, who urged Barry to reconsider his plans for reelection just 
days before the mayor was arrested, said he would issue another statement "on 
local political matters" Monday. Lewis did not say whether his remarks would 
address Barry's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said Barry would issue a statement today but 
did not indicate if the subject would be his decision on whether to seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Washington Post survey said that a majority of District of 
Columbia residents polled Friday said Barry should resign immediately, while 
three in four said the mayor should not run for a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly half of the 661 randomly selected district residents questioned also 
said they believe that federal law enforcement officials were "out to get 
Marion Barry any way they could." 
</P>
<P>
WRC-TV, citing law enforcement sources, reported that the cocaine possession 
charge Barry faces, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a 
$1,000 fine, will not be dropped unless the mayor resigns.

EAST BLOC'S RETURN TO HARD-LINE RULE FEARED; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. POLICY: HUGE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF THE NEWLY LIBERATED NATIONS 
COULD PUSH SOME AWAY FROM FREEDOM, ANALYSTS AND POLICY MAKERS SAY.

<P>
Government analysts and Bush Administration policy makers are increasingly 
worried that the huge social and economic problems of the freshly liberated 
East Bloc nations could push some of them away from freedom and into the grip 
of new authoritarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials still ardently support the East Bloc reformers, 
but they say the process of democratization is so fragile it could fall victim 
to political fragmentation, aggravated by serious economic strains. 
</P>
<P>
The result, they say, could be a blighting of hopes for liberalization and a 
return to autocratic -- though probably non-Communist -- governments in at 
least some of the former Soviet satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen tremendous positive change in Eastern Europe, but now we're 
beginning to focus on the problems," a senior Administration official said 
Friday. "There are political instabilities. There are enormous economic 
problems. In short, there are tough times ahead." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts view Poland as especially vulnerable -- partly because its 
economy already is far worse off than those of the other, more-advanced East 
European countries such as East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and partly 
because it has the most sweeping reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
"In Poland, we see a wave of strikes barely two weeks after the introduction of 
a truly amazing economic program," an official said. "If anything goes 
massively wrong, it is likely to be in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
If Warsaw's sweeping package of reforms does not produce some improvement soon, 
government sources said, the Solidarity-backed government could falter and 
eventually lose power to the military, which historically in Poland has taken 
things into its own hands during times of major governmental crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move could thrust Poland back into the hands of an authoritarian regime 
for the foreseeable future, one senior official said. "You might see a 
situation like the one in Argentina," said one well-placed East European 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
While Poland is considered most critical, Administration officials and senior 
government analysts also cite difficulties in other East European countries. 
The current unrest in Romania is "troubling," one official said. He called the 
situation in East Germany "unclear and confusing." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration may soon consider new aid packages for countries such as 
Czechoslovakia and Romania, where the fall of the old Communist regimes came 
too late to be included in the assistance approved by Congress last summer for 
Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
As the Administration views the East European situation, the newly liberated 
governments can be divided into two major categories: Economically healthy 
countries -- Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary -- and countries beset by 
potentially crippling problems -- Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a country-by-country rundown of Washington's assessment of the 
situation in Eastern Europe: 
</P>
<P>
* Czechoslovakia: At the "top of the list" of potential success stories among 
the East Bloc states. The Communist Party has been discredited and is in full 
retreat. The country has the necessary historical and cultural conditions to 
make its reforms work, and it lacks the bitter ethnic and nationalistic 
divisions that haunt some other countries in the region. It also has a highly 
skilled work force. 
</P>
<P>
* Hungary: No. 2 on most lists, Hungary began its reforms long before other 
East European countries. It has a motivated work force and an emerging 
political system. The question: Will the previous Communist rule be replaced 
with a coherent government after the spring elections? 
</P>
<P>
* East Germany: With a reasonably skilled labor force and a rich uncle (West 
Germany) next door to help with financing, East Germany has bright prospects -- 
if it can get its act together politically. Right now, the Communist Party 
still is fighting to stay alive in the face of determined opposition. 
</P>
<P>
* Poland: Warsaw has put together the most sweeping program for economic 
reform, but its economy also is in the worst shape. The big question is how far 
the Solidarity-backed government can push its austerity program without 
splitting the party and losing support. 
</P>
<P>
* Bulgaria: So far, everything is moving in the right direction. But it will 
take longer -- possibly a year -- for the Bulgarians to rout the Communists 
from their government and perhaps even longer for them to begin getting their 
economy back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
* Romania: A country without long-time democratic traditions, Romania needs 
prompt elections, but it may not be able to achieve that goal. Human rights is 
likely to be a major issue for several more months, possibly years. 
</P>
<P>
As they assess the clouded future of Eastern Europe and grope for ways to 
bolster prospects for democratic governments and market-oriented economies, 
Administration officials continue to marvel at the Soviet Union's decision to 
take a hands-off attitude when the anti-Communist upheavals began. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the United States has no evidence that the Soviet Union has been 
actively involved in the reform effort in any country besides Czechoslovakia. 
And even there, Moscow's role was indirect: Soviet officials merely signaled 
that Moscow now regarded its 1968 invasion as a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Romania, where Moscow had no love for the late dictator, Nicolae 
Ceaucescu, the Soviets were restrained in advance of his overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing the Soviets wanted was to get involved in a resistance movement 
that might fail," one U.S. official said.

SOVIET ENCLAVE DECLARES INDEPENDENCE

The ruling council of the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan declared 
independence Saturday from the Soviet Union and called for international 
protection, according to an Iranian news agency report later confirmed by 
officials in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's IRNA news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the declaration of the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic called on Turkey, Iran and the United Nations 
to secure its territorial integrity. The report quoted the statement as 
demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the 2,200-square-mile enclave, 
which bears the same name as its capital city. 
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA report, a Nakhichevan television station broadcast the 
announcement shortly after midnight. It was delivered by Sakina Ali-Ava, 
identified as head of the region's Presidium. 
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report quoted her as declaring that the announcement of independence 
was taken in accordance with the Soviet constitution and that it was proclaimed 
"due to the lack of defense for the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and 
Nakhichevan and the creation of a state of terror following the aggressions of 
Armenians." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which followed a broadcast of martial music, appealed for 
outside powers to "prevent a massacre of the people" in the capital city, the 
scene of clashes between Soviet Azerbaijanis and the Armenian minority early 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh told 
reporters that the announcement declared secession from both the Azerbaijan 
republic and the Soviet Union. He argued that the decision violated the 
constitution, which, he said, requires an autonomous enclave to receive 
approval of the superior republic to secede. 
</P>
<P>
Nakhichevan is a small enclave of 250,000 people, mainly Muslims. Located about 
220 miles southwest of Baku and bordering Iran, Turkey and the Soviet republic 
of Armenia, it has been under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction since 1924. 
</P>
<P>
It also has been a hot spot of the current turmoil. Friday's editions of the 
Soviet daily Izvestia reported that Iranian Azerbaijanis, who share the same 
language and Shiite Muslim faith as their Soviet compatriots, had supplied 
weapons to Azerbaijanis north of the border. Moscow reports quoted Izvestia as 
saying thousands of Azerbaijanis had been crossing the border in both 
directions in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million Azerbaijanis live in Iran, and 6.8 million live in Soviet 
Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, angry Nakhichevan residents, seeking closer ties with Iran, 
destroyed about 120 miles of frontier fortifications. And on Friday, according 
to IRNA, large numbers of Soviet Muslims had crossed the border in the 
Nakhichevan area to attend Muslim prayer services in Iran and staged a 
demonstration in support of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government took a cautious stance as the disturbances flared 
earlier this month along its northern border west of the Caspian Sea. "Iran on 
her part," said Mahmoud Vaezi, a deputy foreign minister, "has no penchant for 
taking advantage of the U.S.S.R.'s domestic problems and the pressures mounting 
on Moscow by ethnic crises, especially in the southern republics. Iran is no 
political opportunist, neither is it after a change in the present border lines 
between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, Khamenei raised the Islamic issue, declaring that Muslim 
Azerbaijanis were expressing sectarian values after long decades of suppression 
of religion under the Soviet system. "These sentiments are Islamic and have 
their attractions for 1 billion Muslims worldwide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And on Saturday, IRNA published a statement by the Foreign Ministry calling on 
Moscow to settle the crisis in Azerbaijan by peaceful means and "stop its 
violence against the people." 
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, quoted 
the Tehran statement as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Iran's Foreign Ministry expresses deep regret . . . and seriously wants the 
Soviet government to halt violent encounters with the people of Azerbaijan and 
resolve the issue by employing peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>

TRIAL FINALE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF TV DEALS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: MCMARTIN STORY IS HEADED FOR THE SMALL SCREEN AND BOOKSTORE SHELVES. BUT 
RETELLING THE CASE PRESENTS SOME TRICKY LEGAL AND MORAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV. Abby Mann watched, 
listened -- and saw the makings of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one 
of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case. In that 1986 
interview, Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against 
her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, 
Mann recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer, recognized a theme 
he had tapped before: the hysteria of a witch hunt. Soon, Mann became a 
controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie 
and book deals. And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin 
Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy, at least, 
from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
But Mann and his wife, Myra, who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for 
Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay, aren't expected 
to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case -- or the 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television 
movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project. That 
producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are 
considering projects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a TV thing," one agent said. "Just one of those perfect, 
high-concept, lurid television M-O-Ws" -- an acronym for movies-of-the-week. 
"The producer chases down participants, gets rights -- and then it's an easy 
sale to networks." 
</P>
<P>
Not that easy, network executives say. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment -- the Stuart murder case 
in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first 
docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems. The jury's 
deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a 
victim? 
</P>
<P>
"None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story," predicted Steven 
White, an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC 
and ABC. "First, the man is still accused of 13 crimes. . . . If I were sitting 
in my old job, I wouldn't touch this thing with a 10-foot pole." 
</P>
<P>
"It raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to 
be looked at with a microscope," said Larry Strichman, a senior executive in 
movie development at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the story you want to tell? Is it a story of justice done or justice 
denied? And it's real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question 
is. Unlike a documentary, it's hard to take an ambiguous position in a 
docudrama." 
</P>
<P>
Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however. One pointed out that 
the Billionaire Boys Club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials 
regarding the slayings were over. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no rules," the producer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's role in the McMartin case came to prominence early. Not long after 
the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers 
pitched projects to networks. Though no explicit McMartin story was produced, 
child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject. One CBS fictional movie 
last year -- "Did You Know the Muffin Man?" -- featured a preschool and satanic 
child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning "Judgment at 
Nuremberg" in 1961, won an Emmy for "The Marcus-Nelson Murders," a three-hour 
"Kojak" drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted 
of the killings of two white women. The prosecutors, the media and the 
community seemed blinded by hysteria, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining the confidence of the McMartin defendants, the Manns were ultimately 
hired as "investigators" by the defense. That and their earlier alliance with 
former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child 
molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in 
October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and 
movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become 
public after the trial and appeals were over. But in late 1986, Mann released 
interviews with Stevens in which Stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt. 
Mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict, which would 
improve the value of Mann's movie deal. But Stevens and the Manns have said 
their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores. Ray Buckey's lawyer, 
Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a 
variety of publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Lois Timnick, who covered the case from its early stages 
through the trial, also is planning a book. 
</P>
<P>
Mann said his script isn't a courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a trial movie. It's what happens to human beings. I intend to be fair 
to the parents. I don't mean to be vindicative. . . . For the most part, I have 
great sympathy for the parents."

WOMAN WHO SKIPPED BAIL IS REARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encino woman who skipped bail on a drug charge and then taunted police with 
telephone calls and notes -- including one that read "Nya, Nya, Nya!" -- has 
been arrested in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ulrich, 42, was taken into custody as she left her son's apartment 
Thursday after eluding authorities for more than two years, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ulrich was arrested in June, 1987, by police, who said they found $85,000 worth 
of cocaine in her possession. She disappeared after posting $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
But she kept in touch. 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note from Colorado, included the taunt: "Nya, Nya, Nya!" 
</P>
<P>
Another letter to police began: "Hi, Dingbats. Run, run as fast as you can, you 
can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man." 
</P>
<P>
After her arrest, Ulrich allegedly told detectives that she would make bail 
again and leave the country. Told of the comments, a judge set Ulrich's bail at 
$1 million.

STATE TEACHERS' UNION WARY OF GAS TAX MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Teachers Assn. President Ed Foglia urged delegates Saturday to 
withhold support for a 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase and changes in the 
state spending limit until the union's March meeting to ensure that provisions 
are included in the measures to protect spending for education. 
</P>
<P>
In an address at the union's state council meeting in Los Angeles, Foglia said 
that before the 200,000-member union supports the June ballot measure it must 
be sure that the spending limit does not diminish the gains education has 
achieved since Proposition 98, the school finance initiative that was passed by 
voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' association has lobbied hard against the gasoline tax proposal as 
it is currently written. But that could change, Foglia said, if lawmakers 
follow through with their assurances that education would not be harmed by the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see the guarantees," Foglia said. "It all sounds good, but you know 
how it is when you buy a car. We have to see it in writing." 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline tax increase would help finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion 
transportation improvement plan that includes programs to upgrade highways, 
expand mass transit and manage congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Because the tax hike would raise more money than the state could spend under 
current restrictions, the increase would be tied to a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would modify the state's spending limit. The tax cannot go into 
effect unless voters approve the ballot measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
In brief remarks Saturday to the teachers, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) said he supports the union's position that reforming the state's 
spending limit not be used to reverse gains made in funding for education. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union has contended that the proposed constitutional amendment 
contained a loophole that provided that funds spent by the state for capital 
outlays would be outside the spending limit. If those funds were not considered 
in determining education's 40% of the state budget, the union argued, schools 
would lose substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has warned that if the gasoline tax does not pass this 
year, the state will face a moratorium in new highway construction until July, 
1991.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY BECOMES THE NEW POWER BASE OF LATINO VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the old days, Anglo politicians went after Latino voters by staging photo 
opportunities in East Los Angeles, posing in Belvedere Park in mariachi 
sombreros or downing tacos on Brooklyn Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the real voting strength of the county's Latinos has shifted to the 
southern San Gabriel Valley, Latino politicians say. The communities spread out 
along the Pomona and San Bernardino freeways now represent "the greatest bloc 
of potential Latino voting strength in the southwestern United States," 
contends Richard Martinez, executive director of the Southwest Voter 
Registration and Education Project. 
</P>
<P>
Map makers drawing up potential district configurations of the Board of 
Supervisors in the current federal suit have recognized the Latino voting 
strength of the area, making the banana-shaped swath of the San Gabriel Valley 
the heart of several would-be Latino districts. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 781,000 people in the area, which stretches from Monterey Park 
to West Covina and meanders down to Montebello and Pico Rivera. Three out of 
five of its residents are Latinos, ranging from high-powered "huppies" 
(Hispanic yuppies) to struggling homeowners to recent immigrants from Mexico 
and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
It is a big, diverse community, with little of the overpowering Latino flavor 
of the urban enclaves from which many of its residents have fled. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispanics swim more easily (than other minority groups) in the Anglo sea," 
said Alan Heslop, director of the Rose Institute, a Claremont research center, 
explaining the dispersal of Latinos into the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the densely Latino community in and around East Los Angeles, where 
almost 97% of the population is of Latino origin, the southern San Gabriel 
Valley is a varying mix of Latinos, Asians and Anglos. In Monterey Park, the 
nation's first suburban Chinatown, Asians have supplanted some Latinos, but in 
El Monte and South El Monte, Latino immigrants arrive daily. 
</P>
<P>
"It's everybody's dream to buy a home," said longtime La Puente resident 
Estella Romero. "A lot of us came out from what was then the teeny metropolis 
of Los Angeles to the wide open spaces of the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
They're still coming, whether they settle in tile-roofed hillside villas in 
Hacienda Heights or in cramped bungalows on the flats of South El Monte. Taco 
stands and salones de belleza (beauty parlors) have popped up on Garvey Avenue 
and Valley Boulevard, and Latino-owned manufacturing plants have opened in the 
City of Industry and South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are taking control of the area's politics, too. The San Gabriel Valley 
is the only region in the country with side-by-side congressional districts 
represented by Latinos -- Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) and Rep. Matthew 
G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) -- and its cities are sprinkled liberally with 
Latino elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the region, together with heavily Latino electorates in adjoining 
communities in the Southeast, elected two Latino state senators and two 
assemblymen. There are newly elected Latino city council and school board 
members in communities all across the San Gabriel Valley, including the cities 
of South Pasadena and Pomona, where they are a minority. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Gabriel Valley is really a hidden success story of Latino politicians 
at the municipal level," said Harry Pachon, head of the National Assn. of 
Latino Elected Officials. "This has gone largely unnoticed under the larger 
currents of what's happening in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
It is also an area of hard-edged political concerns, where the old sombrero 
routine won't fly, said political strategist George Pla. "Candidates better 
talk to middle-class voters about crime and jobs and housing -- issues of that 
sort," Pla said. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents resent that there has never been a Latino on the county 
board. "Hispanics have been here for more than 200 years," fumed Henry Barbosa, 
a Monterey Park attorney who is active in Democratic politics, "yet, with all 
of that strength, there's been no opportunity to participate." 
</P>
<P>
But parts of the southern San Gabriel Valley still suffer from the electoral 
indifference and neglect that afflict other minority communities, political 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
"Elected officials pay attention to areas of high registration," said Ernest 
Gutierrez, the only Latino city councilman in El Monte, where more than 
three-quarters of the population is Latino. "That's been the history of 
politics. It's not fair, but that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the "huppies," many of the Latinos in the San Gabriel Valley are recent 
immigrants from Mexico and Central America who are not qualified to vote. 
</P>
<P>
There also people like U.S.-born Armando Mercado, 23, a manufacturing 
production engineer from El Monte who doesn't vote. "What's the difference?" 
said Mercado, as he picked through some videos in a rental store recently. "You 
elect them and they do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Mercado cited Proposition 103, the measure approved by voters last year to 
restrain auto insurance premiums, as one reason for his disenchantment with the 
process. He expected the measure to cut his insurance bill. "They never did 
it," he said. "In fact, my insurance bill went up." 
</P>
<P>
Others talk about the failure of major candidates to speak directly to them. 
"I've never voted because no candidate ever came to me and said I should vote 
for them," said Myrna Rodriguez, a naturalized citizen from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Local political leaders agree that the region has frequently been ignored by 
candidates for state and national office. "Partly it's because we're a 
collection of small municipalities," said Barbosa, who is city attorney for 
Montebello and Lynwood. "That tends to structurally focus people's attention. 
Rosemead looks at Rosemead, and Glendora never looks at Arcadia." 
</P>
<P>
And state and national candidates have often skipped the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the valley's deep pool of 650,000 voters is forcing political strategists 
to take a closer look, Pla said. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley lost his bid for 
governor in 1982 by fewer than 100,000 votes, he noted. "If he had campaigned 
in the San Gabriel Valley, he would have been governor," Pla contended. 
</P>
<P>
Political activists say that having a Latino on the Board of Supervisors could 
be crucial in overcoming indifference in the San Gabriel Valley. "The question 
is, 'Why should we get into the process and vote when the results are 
negligible?' " said Gutierrez. "If people don't see their votes making a 
difference, fewer and fewer will vote." 
</P>
<P>
Young Latino voters like Bertha Ramirez, 19, an El Monte waitress, are 
beginning to ask the same questions, both about their cities and about the 
county government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really weird that there's only one councilman who's Latino in this city," 
she said, standing at the counter of her father's Mexican luncheonette on 
Garvey Avenue, where the clientele had just watched a report in Spanish about 
the redistricting trial in federal court. "Almost everybody here is Mexican. I 
don't think they (Latino candidates) have been given a chance."

PRISON RELEASE ATTRACTS SWARM OF NEWS MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporters from all over the country have converged on the story of Charles 
Rothenberg's Wednesday prison release, for weeks inundating both the man who 
set his son afire and his ex-wife with interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
From Oprah Winfrey's show in Chicago to East Coast network and local television 
news programs, the media have tried to arrange coverage of Rothenberg as he 
leaves prison. The Times, "A Current Affair," CBS News and KABC-TV have 
interviewed the son Rothenberg burned beyond recognition nearly seven years 
ago. CNN is still interested in doing so. Dozens have been turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply today, I think I've fielded probably a half-dozen calls alone about him 
and I expect it will intensify," said Ted McAlister public information officer 
at the San Luis Obispo California Men's Colony from which Rothenberg will be 
paroled. 
</P>
<P>
"Local reporters and press as far away as New Jersey have inquired, so it's 
coast to coast," an already weary McAlister said Thursday. "All forms -- 
television, radio, print -- have contacted us. Oprah Winfrey, Joan Rivers, all 
your other 'Hard Copy,' 'Inside Edition'-type programs." 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, 49, has denied all requests for in-prison interviews. While media 
coverage of his departure from the medium- and minimum-security compound is 
expected to be extensive, it is unlikely that anyone will actually see him 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage about his release has forced prison officials to keep 
Rothenberg's parole destination a secret. So he will be removed from the 
6,465-inmate facility with stealth, officials there say, possibly in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities are trying to avoid a "media circus," another corrections 
official said, a "camp-out" of reporters and television crews is nevertheless 
expected outside the remote prison grounds. 
</P>
<P>
According to Harry Gaynor, director of the New Jersey-based National Burn 
Victim Foundation, at least five media outlets have inquired about having him 
and Rothenberg on their shows once Rothenberg reaches his parole destination, 
and dozens more have called with questions. So many, in fact, that Gainer now 
only returns phone calls collect. The foundation intends to publish "A World 
Without Tears," a book about child abuse co-authored by Gaynor, Rothenberg, a 
psychiatrist and a minister. 
</P>
<P>
To publicize the book -- the foundation would receive any profits -- Rothenberg 
has said he is willing to appear on a few "carefully selected shows" to "help 
other parents." However, none of those appearances has been scheduled because 
Rothenberg does not know where he is being paroled, and it remains unclear 
whether he would be allowed to travel. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rothenberg has refused to be interviewed as his prison release 
approaches for fear of jeopardizing it, he has communicated in several letters 
to reporters. In his correspondence with The Times, he writes incessantly of 
the "overwhelming" media attention. 
</P>
<P>
Some prison officials believe that Rothenberg enjoys what he perceives as 
intense personal interest in him. Thus, they suspect he may ultimately reveal 
his whereabouts once coverage of his release ends. This troubles them, said 
Tipton C. Kindel, spokesman for the Department of Corrections, which oversees 
California's prisons. Parole agents do not want to continually relocate 
Rothenberg in the event communities discover him there and protest. And Kindel 
said some corrections administrators worry what Rothenberg may do when the 
attention fades. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll do something," Kindel said. "I am still convinced this guy loves 
this stuff and if the media would ever leave him alone, I think he is the kind 
of guy who would be interested in getting it (the attention) back." 
</P>
<P>
After seven years in the national spotlight, 13-year-old David Rothenberg and 
his mother, Marie Hafdahl, are tired of the attention. They have repeatedly 
cooperated with the media, partly to promote a 1989 television movie of the 
case and a book she co-authored. 
</P>
<P>
They have refused requests, however, to appear with Rothenberg in any of 
television appearances he might make. And they are hoping reporters will leave 
them alone after this week. 
</P>
<P>
David Rothenberg, who has been interviewed since grade school, says he is tired 
of the questions, the "dumbest" being: Is he angry at his father for trying to 
kill him? "What do you think?" he said he asked the reporter. "What would you 
think? That was a dumb question." 
</P>
<P>
He is polite about it, but adds: "I'm kinda sick of it."

NEWPORT BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he began to strip out of his dripping wet suit Saturday afternoon, 
16-year-old James Richling didn't have to think twice before assessing what 
kind of surfing day it had been. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst, really disappointing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Added his friend, 15-year-old Robert Crosby: "I've seen bigger waves in a 
toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Richling, Crosby and two other companions had been surfing for six hours about 
a quarter-mile south of the Newport Pier, just outside the 4 1/4-mile strip of 
coastline that has been declared off limits since Wednesday night when 250,000 
gallons of sewage spilled from a Fountain Valley treatment plant. The area from 
the Newport Pier north to Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach has been closed 
while officials monitor the water quality. 
</P>
<P>
The spill closed the four surfers' normal spot at Huntington State Beach, so 
they were forced to Newport Beach, where the waves Saturday averaged a foot. 
</P>
<P>
"We get bigger waves up at Huntington because of the jettys. We surf there all 
the time," Crosby said. "You can't ride this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Crosby and his friends were among an estimated 10,000 people who took advantage 
of clear, sunny Saturday weather to head for the affected beach area. Newport 
Beach reported a high of 64 degrees, and similar temperatures along with 
continued clear skies and light winds are forecast for today and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While going into the water in the affected stretch is prohibited until at least 
Monday, the beaches themselves are open, and people are allowed on the sand and 
walkways. 
</P>
<P>
The closure caused some children to build their sandcastles a little farther 
from the surf, some dog owners to throw their sticks away from the water and 
some surfers to look elsewhere for that perfect wave. 
</P>
<P>
Tom and Molly Harris brought their 4-year-old grandson Casey Williams to 
Newport Beach to enjoy the sand and waves, but said they were not disappointed 
by the restricted waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We can go to other side of the pier to swim . . . we've just haven't got 
around to it yet," said Molly Harris, who was armed with a large steel shovel 
for sandcastle building. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, for one, seemed eager to hit the surf, saying that he looked forward to 
"catching the waves and punching the waves." 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the beach, Pat DeCarlo and his two sons were also busily at work 
in the sand, but they didn't have plans to go in the water because it was too 
cold. Authorities said the water temperature was in the mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to do something to get out of the house," DeCarlo said. "It's a 
nice sunny day." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, his son Alex noted, "we have our own spa at home." 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards at Newport and Huntington beaches said about 20 people -- most of 
them surfers -- attempted to defy the closure, but officials reported no major 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pulling people out throughout the day," said Huntington Beach State 
Park lifeguard Eric Sturm. "They've all been very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
County health officials collected water samples along the closed stretch of 
beach Friday to test for sewage contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The test results will not be available until Monday, according to Dave Wenger, 
a marine safety officer in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite lifeguard patrols and numerous warning signs, at least one family took 
a dip in the water without being detected. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Hernandez and his family of six traveled all the way from San Bernardino 
on Saturday to enjoy the beach. Hernandez said he didn't see the warning signs 
about the water. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who was wearing slacks and a long sleeve shirt, simply took off the 
shirt and plunged in. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt fine," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Crosby and his surfing companions also considered braving the waters of 
the closed beaches, but decided in the end to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it," Crosby said. "Maybe I might get sick."

DIANNE KLEIN: FEAR BEATS LOGIC WHEN MEN ARE INVOLVED IN DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defendants in the McMartin Pre-School child molestation case are not 
guilty. That's what a jury pronounced after weighing nearly three years of 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
As a parent, I should be reassured by this. Ray Buckey and his mother really 
didn't do those horrible things. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I don't feel reassured. Some part of me, deep down, where logic means very 
little, doesn't believe. That part of me tells me that I am still afraid. 
</P>
<P>
The line is fine, I realize, between concern and panic. From there, hysteria is 
but a small step away. And when it comes to protecting my daughter, or trying 
to protect her, I know that clearheaded rationality hasn't always ruled. 
</P>
<P>
But after writing these lines, and drawing in my breath, I've come to an 
inescapable conclusion. I would not want Ray Buckey, then or now, to care for 
my 3-year-old daughter. High on the lists of my reasons: He is a man. 
</P>
<P>
This is not an admission that I am proud of. It is sexist, to be sure, and 
hypocritical. I know plenty of men, friends of mine, who are terrific with 
kids. I would not hesitate to leave my daughter in their care. 
</P>
<P>
I am sympathetic, as well, to those who complain that child-care workers, many 
of them with academic degrees, have been ghettoized in the low end of the pay 
scale. That's what happens when women hold most of the jobs. Society says they 
don't deserve anything more. 
</P>
<P>
But still the fear nags, stubbornly, along the borders of common sense. Why 
would a man choose to work in day care? Nurturing is suddenly suspect. Most 
child molesters, I remind myself, are men. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Mestemacher, who operates the Mesa Verde Preschool in Costa Mesa, says 
she knows what I am talking about. She doesn't like it, clearly, but she 
understands it. She says it is a feeling that other parents share. 
</P>
<P>
"I know exactly where you are coming from," she told me when I called the other 
day. "I have had parents go as far as to say they did not want any men around 
their children. They wanted to know if there were any males on the premises 
during operating hours." 
</P>
<P>
There are no men employed at Mesa Verde Preschool, but Mestemacher says that's 
not by her choice. She would gladly hire a qualified male teacher, if she could 
find one. They rarely come around. 
</P>
<P>
"Men add so much to the program," she says. "They are a positive male figure in 
the childrens' eyes. Unfortunately, they are not there. With the situation that 
has happened, I don't blame them. They've become targets." 
</P>
<P>
As I was listening to Mestemacher, herself a mother of two, I found myself 
nodding in agreement, and I felt slightly ashamed. Her words, cooly logical, 
were cutting through irrational fears. 
</P>
<P>
Then I asked Mestemacher if she would have entrusted her own children, now well 
beyond the preschool years, to the care of a male day-care provider. 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking back," she said, pausing with the thought, "I guess I would have to 
answer that I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Other day-care teachers and operators throughout Orange County told me much the 
same thing. Men make parents nervous, and some are clearly afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're talking about putting a child in the total custodial care of a man," 
said one Cypress day-care operator, "then I would have serious doubts." 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Chris Brooks, husband and wife, began operating the Tiny Tots 
Development Center in Costa Mesa six years ago, just about the time that a 
child in Manhattan Beach told his mother that "Mr. Ray" had sodomized him at 
McMartin Pre-School. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got into the business, all this stuff with McMartin had just come 
up, so it was always in the back of my mind," says Gary Brooks. "I don't really 
think about that any more, but, naturally, I don't put myself in compromising 
positions. I am a professional. I use good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who is 34 years old, told me he wasn't offended by my feelings, or 
those of other parents, who over the years have asked him the types of 
questions that women usually don't face. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the stigma," he says. "It is different -- I wouldn't say strange 
-- to have a man in this role. This is a very nurturing field. The stereotype 
of men is that we aren't like that. If there weren't so many stereotypes, maybe 
more men would be in this business." 
</P>
<P>
This, too, I believe to be true. Those in other fields that rely on women 
nurturers -- nursing, counseling and physical therapy come to mind -- have said 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
And, surely, in the year 1990, most of us acknowledge that men have feelings 
too. Fathers freed from the stoic strictures of the past can hug and kiss their 
children, wipe off scraped knees and change their share of diapers. This is 
what most women say that we want. 
</P>
<P>
But this gets put aside, unfairly it seems, when it comes to day care. We've 
read the newspapers and seen the movies on TV. Our fears take hold, and not 
even logic can always shake them loose. 
</P>
<P>
"You change when you become a parent," was how my husband was explaining this 
to an unmarried male friend. "You worry about all sorts of things. You just 
don't want to take any chances."

AIDS-STRICKEN WOMEN: VICTIMS TRY TO CARRY ON 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terri, 25, went to the doctor because she was running out of breath climbing 
the short flight of stairs to her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen specialists and two months later, the diagnosis was shocking. 
Terri had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria, 44, lost her husband to AIDS eight months ago. Now, the mother of 
two is HIV positive. Although she has not been diagnosed as having AIDS, she is 
infected with the virus and one day will develop symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Terri, a white college graduate, was raised in an affluent Orange County 
suburb. Rosa Maria, a native of El Salvador, lives in Los Angeles on $800 a 
month in Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Neither fits the typical high-risk profile. Both are female. Neither has used 
intravenous drugs. And neither has had a blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
But they are among a growing number of women nationwide who have contracted the 
AIDS virus from sex with an infected partner. Both women, whose names have been 
changed to protect their privacy, are among the silent victims of an epidemic, 
forgotten among the sheer numbers of gay men afflicted with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS Services Foundation recently announced plans to form a counseling 
group for women in Laguna Beach that would be the first of its kind in Orange 
County. Response, however, has been poor. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike more than 100,000 men with AIDS, women make up a significantly smaller 
group scattered over a large geographical area. They are often too ill to leave 
their homes and have no transportation or child care. Moreover, many women who 
contracted AIDS through heterosexual contact do not want to attend group 
sessions with intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that many females out there" who have AIDS but don't use 
intravenous drugs, Terri says. "It's not like cancer or something. People are 
too afraid of it and their attitude is, 'Why risk daily contact?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although most women contract AIDS as a result of IV drug use, about 30% get the 
disease from sex with an AIDS carrier -- a man who is an IV drug user, bisexual 
or member of another high-risk group. Thousands more become infected with the 
HIV virus, eventually developing full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
They come from a cross-section of racial and economic groups, ranging from 
single women to wives infected by their husbands. Once diagnosed, many isolate 
themselves from friends and family, afraid of the stigma associated with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"These women are not prostitutes or IV drug users," says Virginia Garzon, who 
runs the Milagros AIDS project, a support group for Latino AIDS sufferers in 
Los Angeles. "A lot of them are housewives leading quiet lives. They don't want 
the neighbors to know. They don't even want their mothers to know." 
</P>
<P>
They are women who suddenly find themselves victims of a terminal illness 
brought on by the infidelities of a husband or lover. Or, they have had more 
than one sexual partner and do not know how they contracted the virus because 
AIDS can take as long as 11 years to manifest itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of women out there who have it (virus), but it hasn't 
been diagnosed," says Irene Briggs, a licensed marriage and family counselor 
who runs a support group for mothers of AIDS victims in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, a 25-year-old woman isn't going to rush out and have an HIV test 
unless she has some reason to." 
</P>
<P>
Terri had just graduated from college when she came down with a type of 
pneumonia commonly associated with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total blow that came out of nowhere," she said. "It's not like I'm a 
gay man who decided to get an AIDS test. One day I got sick and the next thing, 
boom, I've got a killer disease." 
</P>
<P>
Terri believes she got AIDS from a former boyfriend. However, none has admitted 
to being HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago, when she was diagnosed as having AIDS, Terri said she 
occasionally used condoms during sex but only as a means of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
During sex, the HIV virus, present in the semen of an infected man, enters a 
woman's system through cuts in the vagina, according to medical experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain things like genital herpes and sores increase the chance of 
transmission to a woman," says Dr. Sudhir Gupta, an AIDS researcher at UC 
Irvine. "But they are not necessary. In sexual activity, the woman always gets 
some sore -- even microscopic tears -- but that is enough, because the virus is 
so small." 
</P>
<P>
Yet many heterosexuals underestimate the risks of contracting the virus through 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the straight community are so ignorant they think they are never 
going to get it (AIDS)," Terri says. "My doctor told me I probably got it 
before I even knew what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Terri has been more fortunate than most. Two years after being diagnosed, she 
has not suffered the severe, debilitating effects of the disease, such as 
dramatic weight loss and skin discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
She can still work at her job as a supermarket checker. Her parents have 
steered her to the best medical treatment available. For the moment, 
pentamadine, a drug commonly used to treat AIDS patients, is keeping the 
pneumonia at bay. She stopped taking AZT several months ago because it was 
making her anemic. 
</P>
<P>
Like others with AIDS, Terri saw her life change overnight. Plans for a career, 
marriage and children suddenly became pipe dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it all day long -- how can you not?" she says. "My body is 
changing. My skin is drier, my hair is coarser. My body is dying inside." 
</P>
<P>
A year after being diagnosed with AIDS, Terri met her current boyfriend. For 
months, she agonized over how to break the news to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't tell him right off the bat, but I could tell he was falling in love, 
and I couldn't keep leading him on," she said. "The first thing he asked is 
what it would do to us. He's behind me all the way." 
</P>
<P>
She has told two other close friends about her illness. 
</P>
<P>
"It totally breaks my heart that others can't know," she says, "but I don't 
want them to feel different and worry about me. I want things to be as normal 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Terri is bound to her job in a grocery store because she needs the 
health insurance to pay her rising medical bills. She fears that if she changed 
jobs, she would have trouble getting insured because she has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably the worst thing," she says. "I can't live where I want to 
live, I can't work where I want to work. I just feel I am so much more 
ambitious and have so much more to me. This isn't me." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria, a dark-haired woman who seems older than her 44 years, is relaxing 
at the offices of the Milagros AIDS project, handing toys to her young 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria stays awake nights worrying what will become of her children when 
she dies. She has no family in the United States and has little contact with 
her relatives in El Salvador. They do not know that she has the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about my life anymore," she says, gently touching her child's 
forehead. "I just care about what will happen to my children." 
</P>
<P>
She recently hired a lawyer to draft a document that will enable her son, 16, 
to raise her 2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawyer's making arrangements now so the baby won't be given up for 
adoption," Rosa Maria says. "I have some friends who will help him raise her so 
she won't be taken away from him." 
</P>
<P>
She describes how for more than a year she watched her 37-year-old husband die 
from a disease that his doctors could not diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
"I got mad and kept asking them why they couldn't tell me what was wrong with 
him, because he was getting sicker and sicker," she said. "By the time they 
found out he had AIDS, it was already too late." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rosa Maria applied for citizenship under the government amnesty 
program. She wanted to get a green card so she could find work to support 
herself and her two children. 
</P>
<P>
"They wrote me back saying that I was a danger to the United States," she said. 
"I cried and cried and said, 'Why?' because I know that I got the virus here." 
</P>
<P>
Before he died, Rosa Maria's American-born husband told her he had contracted 
AIDS by having sex with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
But she says she's not bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I trust in God," she says. "All I want is for my children to have a better 
life than I had."

Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, received the Orange County 
Humanitarian Award on Saturday night for their support of AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to see AIDS talked about and for something to be done," Emma Jane 
Riley said, just before the couple accepted the award at a dinner and reception 
at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 people attended the dinner, sponsored by AIDS Walk Orange County. 
Proceeds are to be used for research and education about acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The Rileys were chosen for the first-time award by a committee made up of the 
AIDS Walk board of directors and community representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They just emerged as the leaders," said Elizabeth Dorn Parker, co-executive 
director of AIDS Walk. "They work as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted recipients who lived, worked and did their community work in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he first became aware of the gravity of AIDS when he saw a baby 
stricken with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we had something very insidious here that isn't limited to a particular 
kind of person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley was one of just two supervisors to support a measure that would have 
barred discrimination against AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said his support of AIDS causes "has raised a few eyebrows" but said some 
people do not understand what he is trying to accomplish. After he voted for 
the anti-discrimination law -- which lost, 3 to 2, in June -- Riley said that 
because Orange County is conservative, "it's a little more difficult perhaps to 
(vote with) a more open . . . sense of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Rileys have supported AIDS Walk Orange County, which raises money and 
awareness of AIDS, since the walk's inception three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Jane Riley said she hopes that the event will raise attention about the 
need for an AIDS cure. 
</P>
<P>
In its three-year history, AIDS Walk has raised about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Winthrop, assistant director of AIDS Walk, said raising money for AIDS in 
a county with such a strong conservative bent has sometimes proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little hard the first year. Things got better after that, but the 
need is greater" because growing numbers of people are being afflicted by AIDS, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in Orange County, according to 
Winthrop.

OBSCURED MURAL WILL BECOME ART AGAIN THROUGH RESTORATION PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
What began 47 years ago as a make-work project for a starving artist will be 
returned to its original grandeur this year when a neglected mural, now hidden 
above the heads of Fullerton police officers, is restored. 
</P>
<P>
On three walls inside the traffic bureau, hidden by a false ceiling and partly 
obscured by layers of white paint, lies the 47-year-old mural depicting the 
history of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was painted by respected Los Angeles artist Helen Lundeberg shortly 
after the United States entered World War II. Lundeberg, now 81, worked with 
the federal Works Projects Administration, a New Deal project that employed 
artists to decorate public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Lundeberg's pastel and earth-tone mural decorated the high-ceilinged City 
Council chambers until 1963, when a new City Hall opened next door and the 
Police Department took over the old building on the northeast corner of 
Commonwealth and Highland avenues. 
</P>
<P>
During a renovation at the police station, workers installed a lower ceiling, 
pneumatic delivery tubes, fluorescent lights and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Below the new ceiling, two feet of the mural that remained visible were covered 
with white paint. 
</P>
<P>
Above the ceiling, workers punched holes in the mural to attach wooden beams, 
electrical conduits, heating and air conditioning. Part of a horse in the mural 
was destroyed when workers punched a hole in the south wall to attach a 
junction box. 
</P>
<P>
"That's disgusting, what they did to put in that junction box," said Terry 
Galvin, the city's redevelopment director who is coordinating the Police 
Department's renovation. "They just took a pick and chipped all around it with 
no concern for the mural." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Fullerton resident Eva Slater, an artist and friend of Lundeberg, said 
the damage was done without the community being aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a decision by somebody who had the power to do it," she said. "It 
was too late" to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals were made in the 1980s to restore the mural, but none went far. 
Finally, in 1986, city maintenance worker Dennis Hittle started showing photos 
of the mural around City Hall. His interest coincided with the city's effort to 
find a community project to celebrate Fullerton's 100th birthday in 1987, 
Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Hittle photographed the mural after performing work in the crawl space above 
the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Molly McClanahan, Slater and several others formed Friends of 
the Helen Lundeberg Murals and raised money for the restoration. The money has 
long since been raised and set aside. The mural restoration awaits a much 
larger renovation planned for the police station, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will hear a request in February or March to seeks bids for the 
work, he said. The city has hired Los Angeles-based A.T. Heinsbergen &amp; Co. 
to restore the mural. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration will include removing the new ceiling and walls, removing the ducts 
and tubes that were added, and patching the walls in preparation for the mural 
work, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Restoring the mural with a team of three or four artists should take about 
three months after that, Heinsbergen President Anthony T. Heinsbergen said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the old Fullerton City Hall, Lundeberg's projects include murals in the 
library at Venice High School, at Canoga Park High School, and a 245-foot 
outdoor mosaic along a wall at Centinela Park in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Lundeberg liked to paint in subdued colors -- earth tones and soft pastels, 
said Tobey C. Moss, a friend of Lundeberg who runs an art gallery in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lundeberg's work has been reprinted in several art books, and her paintings are 
displayed in several large museums, Moss said. Her most well-known painting, 
"Double Portrait of the Artist in Time," hangs in the National Museum of 
American Art in Washington.

the building. DON KELSEN / Los Angeles Times

A POSSIBLE DELAY IN COFFMAN CASE SEEN; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: NEWLY APPOINTED ATTORNEYS OF A WOMAN ALREADY SENTENCED TO DEATH IN A SAN 
BERNARDINO MURDER SAY THEY NEED TIME TO PREPARE HER DEFENSE.

<P>
The newly appointed lawyers of Cynthia Coffman, already sentenced to death in 
San Bernardino, say her Orange County trial date in two weeks may be postponed 
until the end of the year to give them time to prepare her defense. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman, 28, who confessed that she participated with her boyfriend in the 1986 
kidnap-murders of two women in Redlands and Huntington Beach, was the first 
woman sentenced to death in California since capital punishment was reinstated 
12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coffman and Gregory Marlow, 34, were sentenced to death in August for the Nov. 
5, 1986, murder of 20-year-old insurance clerk Corrine Novis. Orange County 
prosecutors are seeking a second death sentence against them for the Nov. 12, 
1986, murder of 19-year-old Lynell Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow's attorney in the San Bernardino case, Ray L. Craig of Riverside, is 
staying on to represent him in Orange County. But Coffman and her lawyers 
agreed she needed a new defense team. It wasn't until December that the Orange 
County public defender's office was appointed to represent her. And it wasn't 
until early January that deputy public defenders Leonard Gumlia and David C. 
Biggs were assigned to the case. Gumlia said last week that he and Biggs didn't 
know enough about the case yet. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, just yesterday I received 19 boxes on this case from San 
Bernardino," Gumlia said. "It's going to be several months before we are even 
fully knowledgeable about the case." 
</P>
<P>
Gumlia said it could be the end of 1990 before Coffman goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
One issue to be decided before then is whether Coffman will be tried separately 
from Marlow. Both defendants, who have become bitter enemies since their 
arrest, had asked for separate trials in San Bernardino, but their requests 
were denied. 
</P>
<P>
Gumlia did not rule out the possibility of trying to plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
But while Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown stands by his policy 
of refusing to discuss his cases with the media, so far his office's position 
has been that it will not accept anything short of a second death sentence for 
Coffman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing as if this case is going to go to trial," Gumlia said. "One 
of my biggest concerns is that jurors might discover that she already has one 
death sentence; it might have an effect on them."

MATER DEI COMES BACK FOR 68-53 VICTORY

After every basket Mater Dei High School scores, the Monarch fans yell, 
"Whoosh!" 
</P>
<P>
That was something like the sound Mater Dei made as it raced past Bishop 
Montgomery in the second half to beat the Knights, 68-53, in an Angelus League 
game at Bishop Montgomery Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was no easy victory for the Monarchs (20-1 overall, 4-0 in the Angelus 
League), the Southern Section's top-rated 5-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery fell to 11-4 overall, 3-1 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bishop Montgomery) is a good team, they are a true contender," Mater Dei 
Coach Gary McKnight said. "(Bishop Montgomery Coach) Doug Mitchell has done a 
great job with them. The Angelus League is stronger than people think; it'll 
show up in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights were winless in the league last season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei trailed, 31-28, at halftime, but led the third quarter with a 19-0 
run that spanned the period's first four minutes and 29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell called two timeouts during the spurt and yelled to his team that "the 
game wasn't over." 
</P>
<P>
But after Dan O'Neil hit a 15-footer to the right of the basket with 3:23 left 
in the third quarter for a 47-31 lead, the game was virtually out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids got together at halftime and just decided that they were going to 
play together," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mitchell: "We played hard, but we didn't play intelligent. When they 
started that run, we panicked, we started (putting) up bad shots. Hopefully, it 
was a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei is a good team to learn from as the Monarchs committed only three 
second-half turnovers in wearing down Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Bishop Montgomery struggled to build a 26-18 lead with 4:22 
left in the second quarter. Mater Dei began forcing the Knights into 
cross-court passes, three of which were intercepted and led to baskets. The 
Monarchs cut the lead to three points, and the first half ended with Bishop 
Montgomery leading, 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Daniel scored 15 points in the first two quarters, but then was held to 
one three-point basket in the second half. He led Bishop Montgomery with 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei guard David Boyle led all scorers with 21 points.

Canyon High School won two individual championships for 108.5 points and a 
sixth-place finish in the Five Counties wrestling tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Jason Mitchell decisioned Marco Ahlgren of Rancho Buena Vista, 7-3, in 
the 138-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Zack Cooper, the state's No. 1 wrestler in his weight class and 
defending tournament champion at 191, decisioned No. 2 David Popejoy of 
Bellarmine College Preparatory, 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the toughest invitational tournament we have been in, and this year's 
competition was tougher than last year's (when Canyon won it)," Canyon Coach 
Gary Bowden said. "I can't praise the team enough. They wrestled as hard as 
they could." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he went into his championship match "nervous and hesitant. I had 
never seen Popejoy wrestle until this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he regained his confidence after the first period, then "set up my 
moves and waited for him to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Clovis won the tournament championship with 151 points, followed by Valhalla 
(136), Selma (120), Overfelt (110.5) and Bellarmine College Preparatory (109). 
Valencia finished ninth (82) and Esperanza and Savanna tied for 15th (48). 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Tony Okada (132) won the tournament's most outstanding lightweight 
trophy after pinning Covina's Richard Martinez in 3 minutes 6 seconds. Okada 
(29-0) had two pins, two technical falls and a 9-0 decision in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I didn't think the final match would be close," Okada said 
of the final. "But I threw Martinez with a head-and-arm lock and went for the 
pin while he was on his back." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's Rob Langenwalter (25-2), 1989's Five Counties champion at 105 
pounds, won the 126-pound class by default over Roseburg's Richard Allen. Allen 
couldn't wrestle in the final because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's James Lopez (112) lost his match to Madera's Ben Ervin by a 
referee's decision.

Chris Kostoff looked at the scoreboard and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
It read: Capistrano Valley 74, El Toro 51. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a lot closer than that," said Kostoff, a 6-foot-2 guard. 
"(Assistant Coach Brian) Mulligan always pushes defense on us. It makes us look 
pretty good when we can hold El Toro to only 51." 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff and Scott McCorkle did their share offensively, scoring 26 points each 
as the Cougars, the seventh-ranked team in Orange County, cruised past the 
fourth-ranked Chargers Saturday night at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars improved to 13-7 overall and moved into a first-place tie with 
Mission Viejo in the South Coast League. Both teams are 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play better in the second half of the (league) season," Capistrano 
Valley Coach Mark Thornton said. "Everyone will be pointing toward us now." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars were gunning for El Toro (15-4, 3-2) early in the second quarter. 
El Toro had its last lead of the game, 21-20, after a layup by Greg Everett 
with 6:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, sparked by McCorkle's five points and Kostoff's seven, went 
on a 19-7 run to grab a 39-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Tim Travers said the Chargers' sloppy play on offense let 
Capistrano Valley take control of the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute on offense and they scored on a lot of transition baskets in 
the second quarter," Johnson said. "We were not in our offense. It was as 
simple as that. They outplayed us with their defense and our spark went out. 
They deserved to win. They kicked our butts." 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle and Kostoff continued to score from the outside and slice through El 
Toro's defense for layups in the second half. Kostoff had 14 points in the 
second half and McCorkle 12 in the second half as the Cougars led by as many as 
25. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris and Scott had great games," Thornton said. "But I look down our bench 
and I can't say anyone had a bad game." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Capistrano Valley's strong play showed up in the scorebook. Guard 
Brett McCorkle, Scott's brother, finished with only two points, but Thornton 
was still showering him with praise. McCorkle held Rob Johnson, El Toro's 
leading scorer, to four-of-16 shooting and 11 points. Kevin Martin led El Toro 
with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job on their scorers," Thornton said. "And Eric Gruenewald (11 
points, 11 rebounds) did great inside." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, which had a 24-game winning streak ended by Mission Viejo 
two weeks ago, extended its current winning streak to three games.

HE'S STILL GROWING INTO HIS POTENTIAL;

<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: LOS ALAMITOS' ROBERT CONLISK LEARNS THAT LIFE AS A 6-FOOT-11 
CENTER CAN BE FRUSTRATING. BUT IT ALSO CAN BE REWARDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks watched a gangly eighth-grader 
run up and down the basketball court at the Griffins' summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell he was going to be very tall," Brooks remembers. "He was very 
immature, though. When you are large and just an eighth- or ninth-grader, you 
get teased a lot. It bothered him. You could tell he had the athletic ability, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for Brooks to recognize Robert Conlisk's potential. At 
6-feet-3, Conlisk towered over the other eighth-graders at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk, now a 6-11 senior, is still taller than his teammates and most 
opponents. And Brooks still talks in terms of potential about Conlisk, the 
center of attention on the Los Alamitos basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attention has come from college recruiters, who also saw Conlisk's 
potential. He has signed a letter of intent to play at Arizona State next 
season, turning down offers from De Paul, New Mexico, Washington and Colorado. 
He's part of a Sun Devil recruiting class that has been ranked among the top 
five in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, he can play at the Division I level," Brooks said. "He has very 
good ballhandling skills and has an outstanding touch for someone who's 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rewarding as a coach to see him mature mentally and physically. He's 
capable of making some money at this someday. You look around the NBA and they 
want big guys who can score -- and he can score. He just needs to work on his 
rebounding and defense." 
</P>
<P>
But for all his potential, Conlisk, at times, has faded into the background of 
the Griffins' offense. One night he'll score 33 points and have 15 rebounds. 
Then he'll have four points and be strapped with foul problems. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents double- and triple-team him. He averages 17.4 points, 9.2 rebounds 
and four blocked shots a game while shooting 57% from the field. Solid figures, 
but not imposing ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistically, this year has been more of a disappointment," Conlisk said. "I 
wanted more points. But Coach Brooks told me I would be double- and 
triple-teamed more this year." 
</P>
<P>
The swarming defenses often frustrate Conlisk. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been one game where they've gone man-to-man against us," Conlisk 
said. "I've had to cope with it." 
</P>
<P>
His frustration turned to anger in a 56-42 loss to Mission Viejo in the 
semifinals of the Estancia tournament on Dec. 29. The Diablos' defense sagged 
on Conlisk, preventing him from getting inside position. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Four points, five rebounds and four fouls for Conlisk. 
</P>
<P>
When Conlisk picked up his fourth foul with 2:08 left in the third quarter, 
Brooks pulled him out and asked what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk, who didn't have any answers, made a smart remark. 
</P>
<P>
And before he knew what happened, Conlisk was riding the lonesome pine. 
</P>
<P>
"They (officials) called fouls on me because I was a big guy shoving around 6-2 
guys," Conlisk said. "I had some stupid fouls. I was upset and I talked back. 
It was real disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk held his own attitude adjustment seminar. He began to accept the fact 
that being double-teamed was as much of a 6-11 center's life as points and 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little immature," he said. "I've started to grow up some more." 
</P>
<P>
He tested his new attitude against Western on Jan. 3. He was double-teamed, as 
usual, but finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that was my New Year's resolution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk called the benching a "learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
"I learned I have to be patient and that some calls go against me," he said. "I 
need to move more in the offense and not let everyone converge on me." 
</P>
<P>
The benching wasn't the first time Conlisk drew the ire of his coach. A 
connoisseur of fine dunking, Conlisk once did a 360-degree jam when the 
Griffins trailed by 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks wasn't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't do that when you're losing," he said. "In baseball, you don't 
steal a base when you're up eight runs." 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk still cherishes every chance to dunk. He averages about three a game, 
but his repertoire no longer includes 360s. 
</P>
<P>
"I have fun doing dunks," he said. "It really gets the fans excited. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, there wasn't anyone at the games. This year, after I dunked three 
or four times, everyone was saying: 'What are you going to do tonight? I'm 
going to the Los Alamitos game.' My friends are all betting on how many (dunks) 
I'm going to throw in each game." 
</P>
<P>
There's no early line on how many dunks he'll have Wednesday, when the Griffins 
(15-5 overall, 5-0 in the Empire League) play at Cypress (7-12, 0-5). 
</P>
<P>
"Not all of his shots are dunks," Brooks said. "He can step out and shoot the 
jumper. If we let him shoot more three-pointers, he would be one of the better 
ones on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Loara Coach Jerry Halpin said Conlisk is one of the best shooting centers his 
team has played. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so much more of a force on offense this year than last year," Halpin 
said. "He can hit the shot from anywhere. He's a good big man. He keeps the 
ball up high and has a good shot. He didn't miss many against us." 
</P>
<P>
But Halpin will remember Conlisk best for one of his weaknesses -- rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk followed a missed layup by teammate Steve Sargeant with two seconds 
left to give the Griffins a 93-91 victory over Loara on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Loara guard Tes Whitlock scored 54 points, tied for third highest in Orange 
County history, against the Griffins and drew most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos got the victory, rallying from an 18-point deficit in the first 
half behind the play of Conlisk (20 points, 13 rebounds) and Jason Cunningham 
(30 points). 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk laughs when reminded of his important rebound. The back of his warmup 
jersey reads "All Windex," but you won't see him cleaning the glass very often. 
</P>
<P>
"After I signed with Arizona State, the first thing (Coach Bill) Frieder told 
me was that I wasn't a good rebounder," he said. "Nine rebounds (a game) isn't 
good for someone my height. Sometimes, I have more more dunks than I do 
rebounds." 
</P>

YEAR AT POINT OF LOW RETURN FOR INCOME-CONSCIOUS INVESTORS; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: INTEREST RATES FOR SAVERS ARE NOT AS REWARDING AS A DECADE AGO, BUT 
TAXES AND INFLATION AREN'T TAKING AS BIG A BITE.

<P>
The financial menu looks pretty skimpy as income-conscious investors consider 
where to put their money for a new year and a new decade. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how far in time you are willing to extend yourself, alluring returns 
on certificates of deposit, bonds and other interest-bearing investments are 
hard to find these days. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, you are unlikely to come across anything now that matches the 
two-digit yields on low-risk securities that were so commonly available in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But inflation has also declined in recent years, and so has the maximum rate at 
which the federal government taxes most people's interest income. So, in the 
view of many analysts, the "real" returns offered now aren't as stingy as they 
might look. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose as 1990 begins that you can get a yield of 8.3% from a CD or 
money-market mutual fund. If your income tax bracket is 28% -- the top rate 
that applies to most savers and investors -- you have a return of 6% left over 
after Uncle Sam takes his cut. 
</P>
<P>
After taking into account consumer inflation in the 4% to 5% annual range, you 
still emerge with a positive return. 
</P>
<P>
On paper at least, that beats the results you might have achieved at a nominal 
interest rate of, say, 13% a decade ago, when inflation and taxes together 
would have left you actually in the red. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the current returns that savers and investors can get are only part 
of the story. The ideal investment choice also must keep looking good through 
the future ups and downs of inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, many analysts are predicting at least a modest decline in interest 
rates over the next several months. That would argue in favor of longer-term 
investments such as CDs or bonds rather than short-term options such as money 
market funds. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, interest rates at present are such that you get paid little or 
nothing for making that kind of longer-term commitment. 
</P>
<P>
A recent tally by the Bank Rate Monitor showed three-month CDs yielding an 
average of 7.87%; two-year CDs 7.71%, and five-year CDs 7.73%. 
</P>
<P>
This is known in financial circles as a flat, or slightly "inverted," yield 
curve, and it is abnormal although by no means unprecedented in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
The yield curve has been out of kilter for more than a year now. But some 
analysts think it is slowly beginning to resume a more orthodox shape. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest independent 
investment advisory service, recommends keeping your options open by sticking 
mainly with short-term commitments. "A bit more patience," the firm urges, "a 
wait until the long rate offers more of a yield advantage to warrant the added 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
Staying short term, of course, also gives you protection should interest rates 
pull a surprise by heading higher. In that event, yields on vehicles such as 
money market funds would stand to move up as well. 
</P>
<P>
What if interest rates should neither rise nor fall, but hover around present 
levels for some indeterminate period? 
</P>
<P>
That would create few opportunities for investors to pull off heroic coups of 
market timing. But it would leave enough goodies to go around that hardly 
anyone need be entirely dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"The sideways scenario isn't bad for either camp," observed Edward Yardeni, 
economist at the Wall Street firm of Prudential-Bache Securities.

BOAT BUILDERS AND DEALERS GET SINKING FEELING; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: SHOWROOMS TURN INTO DRY-DOCKS AS THE BUSINESS COPES WITH 
OVERPRODUCTION AND A LESSENING OF CONSUMER DEMAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Buzz Hardy, the owner of Sundown Marine in San Diego, stands to lose more than 
$600 on each of the five sleek 17-foot Glastron Futura powerboats now on sale 
at his dealership for $13,600, a 20% markdown from his asking price six months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Such close-out prices are a first in Hardy's 13-year career as a boat merchant. 
But, with Sundown's 1989 boat sales down 25% from the previous year, and with 
1990 off to a less than auspicious start, Hardy just can't afford to watch his 
showroom become a perpetual dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was buying. Nobody was even looking," Hardy said. "It's not that people 
were out there wanting to buy but couldn't get credit. They just flat weren't 
coming into the store." 
</P>
<P>
The price cuts by Hardy and several other Southern California boat dealers were 
a symptom of a significant slump in recreational power boat sales nationwide 
last year, the first decline in boat sales after seven years of growth. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the National Marine Manufacturers Assn., boat 
sales dropped last year to 638,000, a 15% decline from the 749,000 units sold 
in 1988. The sales figures include sailboats and power boats. Total dollars 
spent on all boats and boating accessories fell to $17.1 billion in 1989, from 
$17.9 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have blamed everything from bad weather and rising interest 
rates to the San Francisco earthquake, which hit just a few days before one of 
Southern California's biggest boat shows, for the seven-month slump. But the 
one thing on which everyone agrees is that dealers were stocked with more boats 
than they could sell at a time when consumers were looking elsewhere for 
recreation and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was contracting, and we continued to build into that down cycle," 
said Greg Proteau, spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers Assn. in 
Chicago. "It's very hard to just turn off the switch, and it's going to be a 
little difficult to turn it back on." 
</P>
<P>
The power boat industry has gone through tremendous change since the end of 
1986, when most boats were assembled by dealers who had to buy the boat shell, 
engine and trailer from separate specialty manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
At about that time, Brunswick and Outboard Marine, two of the nation's largest 
producers of powerboat engines, began to realize that there were profits to be 
made by integrating the industry, and embarked on plans to bring the disparate 
aspects of boat making under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1986, Brunswick took the first step by spending $425 million to 
acquire Bayliner Marine, which is generally regarded as the first boat company 
to package boats, engines and trailers at reduced prices. Outboard Marine soon 
followed suit, and, by February, 1989, had spent $230 million to buy 10 smaller 
boat manufacturing companies, including Chris Craft and Four Winns, two widely 
recognized brand names. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions appeared to be to everyone's benefit, said Outboard Vice 
President Wayne Jones. "Dealers like the idea of not having to be the final 
assembler. Boat manufacturers can do their job more cheaply by pre-rigging all 
the controls in a boat. And consumers like the one-stop shopping." 
</P>
<P>
But many dealers now say they were taken in by the acquisition frenzy, 
encouraged to take on more boats than they could sell by smaller manufacturers 
who were eager to look attractive to the big buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period of acquisition, a lot of boat manufacturers exaggerated 
their production and filled the dealer pipelines with excessive inventory," 
said Tom Fetter, owner of Kettenburg Marine in San Diego, a large distributor 
of marine parts. 
</P>
<P>
But rising interest rates and declining consumer confidence soon led to a slip 
in sales by early spring, marking the start of what many analysts describe as a 
leveling off period for the boating industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Outboard Marine projected net losses in the $15-million to 
$19-million range for the first quarter ended Dec. 31, with total sales down 
about 12% from last year. Although a $100-million pretax restructuring charge 
last year makes it difficult to compare Brunswick's earnings in 1989 with the 
year before, securities analysts put the marine segment's losses, excluding 
extraordinary charges, at about $10 million for each of the last two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices of both publicly held companies have recently traded at or near 
their 52-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to streamline its costs and to combat massive declines in 
powerboat sales, Brunswick last summer reorganized its marine group, closed six 
plants and laid off more than 4,000 workers. But some predict the decline will 
continue at least through the end of the year, if not longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat business is in trouble and it has been for some time," said Merrill 
Lynch securities analyst Harold Vogel. "The consumer is tapped out. They're 
borrowed up to their necks. Their houses aren't increasing in value. I 
personally think it's a recession, and that it's not going to turn around any 
time soon." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that bleak prognosis, many local dealers remain optimistic they will be 
able to ride out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Several dealers interviewed said they are coping with the sales slump by 
stepping up advertising, cutting prices and passing on manufacturer-sponsored 
financing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy of Sundown Marine said that some customers have been buying boats from 
him through an aggressive loan-financing program made available through 
Outboard Marine that required no down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Ciccarelli, a principal of Newport Pacific boat dealership in Newport 
Beach, said he cut about 3% from his boat prices about six months ago in order 
to make the boats more attractive and to eliminate a "negotiating buffer" that 
allowed "a silver-tongued attorney to get a better deal than a blue collar 
worker who doesn't have the same verbal skills." 
</P>
<P>
He also put younger people who are willing to work for less money onto his 
sales force and and trained them to drum up prospective customers with 
telephone and direct mail solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
Other dealers are consolidating their operations or offering a wider array of 
recreational products to their customers. Sea Ray power boats in San Diego 
recently joined forces with Winnebago dealer Herb Hulet in an effort to "hedge 
our bet into the '90s," Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales slump has changed the way a lot of powerboat dealers do 
business, it appears to have had less effect on dealers who sell big, expensive 
yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Sperling, co-owner of Pacific Yacht Sales in Marina del Rey, said that, 
although he saw fewer first-time buyers last year, he more than made up the 
difference in sales of larger boats, many priced at more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tended to sell more and more boats in the 38-foot to 58-foot category," 
Sperling said. "We've also tended to see people graduating into larger and 
larger boats." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the operative phrase for the 1990s, according to the National Assn. of 
Marine Products and Services, is "Fewer but larger," with weaker companies 
closing shop and profitable ones consolidating and winning larger shares of the 
boating market. 
</P>
<P>
By 1994, according to a study published by the association, the number of 
healthy dealerships nationwide is expected to drop to 8,000 from a high in 1988 
of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the surviving dealers are expected to generate an average of $2.4 
million each in sales, up from an average of $1.3 million in 1988.

CALL ID SERVICE MAKES SCIENCE FICTION A REALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
In the movie "Back to the Future Part II," the character played by Michael J. 
Fox gets a phone call in the year 2015. As a face appears on Fox's big-screen 
picture phone, type at the bottom of the screen flashes not only the caller's 
name and address, but his age and job title, his wife's and kids' names, his 
politics and hobbies, even his food preferences. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a fleeting moment in that comedy's hyperkinetic look at future pop 
culture. But using phone connections to identify callers and even to delve into 
their backgrounds is no longer lightweight science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
In several states, phone companies are already offering Caller ID. The service 
allows home phone customers to see the phone number of the person calling them 
before they pick up the receiver. The number appears on a small box with a 
display screen. 
</P>
<P>
The leading manufacturer of the Call Identifier box (a unit attached to home 
phone jacks that sells on average for less than $100) is Colonial Data 
Technologies Corp. in New Milford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Like a high-tech rock plunked into the placid pool of our phone culture -- a 
culture of push-button anonymity that has yielded both obscene phone calls and 
lifesaving hot lines -- the splash made by Caller ID could be felt by everyone 
from undercover cops to mothers-in-law, from bill collectors to battered women. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Caller ID see it as an electronic peephole that lets you decide 
which calls you wish to take. Opponents -- who would require that the service 
be provided with free blocking for anyone who doesn't want their phone number 
exposed -- see it as an X-ray-by-phone that would reveal unlisted phone 
numbers, identities and other information callers don't want to give out. 
</P>
<P>
In Connecticut, Southern New England Telecommunications appears in no rush to 
offer Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of the concerns that many people have regarding privacy," SNET 
spokesman William Seekamp says. "We frankly want to see how that gets worked 
out in some of the areas where it (Caller ID) has been introduced." 
</P>
<P>
(In Pennsylvania, where Caller ID service was to have begun this week, 
opponents won a temporary injunction from a state court. The service will be 
allowed to go into effect only for police, fire and emergency service users.) 
</P>
<P>
But SNET has received approval to offer, on a yearlong trial basis, a package 
of services called Star Call. 
</P>
<P>
Among those services, which will be tried out in several Connecticut 
communities, is one that allows subscribers to block calls coming from 
specified phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Another service allows subscribers to automatically trace a call they have just 
received by punching a few buttons on their touch-tone phones. (The traced 
number would not be accessible to the consumer, but would be held by the phone 
company for use by the police in a legal action.) 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get the ID, but you can exercise some control over incoming calls," 
Seekamp says of Star Call. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at some business switchboards around the country, Connecticut callers 
are already having their phone numbers identified, Seekamp says. 
</P>
<P>
So-called Automatic Number Identification -- in effect, Caller ID on a mass 
scale -- is now offered by long-distance phone companies and used by dozens of 
businesses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced ANI systems not only display the phone number you're calling from 
(including unlisted ones, Seekamp says), but also cross-index that number with 
other computer databases to reveal your name and address as well as -- shades 
of "Back to the Future" -- demographic details based on where you live, from 
what kind of house you live in to what kind of car you drive. 
</P>
<P>
As for Caller ID, phone companies such as New Jersey Bell, which began offering 
the service more than a year ago, give it a ringing endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best technology available for putting an end to things like 
harassing, obscene or irritating phone calls, which is a major problem," Jersey 
Bell spokesman Peter Ventimiglia says. 
</P>
<P>
Garden State phone owners received about 360,000 such calls in the year before 
Caller ID became available, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ventimiglia also cites the service's tracking advantages to small businesses 
such as pizza parlors, which are plagued by prank calls or worse -- robberies 
of their delivery workers. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey Bell does not offer blocking for those who don't want their numbers 
revealed, even though Ventimiglia concedes, "The technology is there" to do it. 
"In our view, it diminishes the value of the service," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 30,000 New Jersey Bell customers have signed up for the service, 
which costs $6.50 a month after a $21 installation fee. (At the moment, the 
service only identifies numbers of callers within the same area code.) 
</P>
<P>
The phone company reports a dozen complaints about the service. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience with the service here in New Jersey simply doesn't prove out 
any of those speculative objections" to it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But civil libertarians and consumer advocates are not so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential impact on individual privacy is enormous," says William Olds, 
executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Olds cites as examples the dampening effect on government and corporate 
whistle-blowers, whose calls and identities could be instantly traced, and the 
service's undermining effect on the 219,000 SNET customers (about 15%) with 
non-published phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that making a simple inquiry by phone to a business, from a real estate 
firm to a car dealership, could get your number on a list for phone 
solicitation.

Here in the heart of what bicoastal snobs call fly-over country, folks are 
helping to decide how the nation will live and die. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the office of William L. Webster, Missouri's 36-year-old attorney 
general, brought three cases before the U. S. Supreme Court that directly touch 
on the issues of when life begins and when and how it might end. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the Supreme Court accepted Missouri's argument that the state's 
planned execution of 16-year-old Heath Wilkins would not be cruel and unusual. 
</P>
<P>
In a case argued in December but yet to be decided, Missouri asserted its right 
to prevent the family of 25-year-old Nancy Cruzan -- who has remained in a 
"persistent vegetative state" since a 1983 automobile accident -- to remove the 
water and nutrition tube that keeps her body functioning. The court's decision 
is predicted to affect tens of thousands of families with comatose loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
And in July of last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services that many observers believe has undermined the 
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which guarantees women the right to abortion. 
Underlying Missouri's argument was its clearly stated position that "the life 
of each human being begins at conception." 
</P>
<P>
Last century, in a Missouri-based case most citizens of the state would rather 
forget, the Supreme Court decided that neither Dred Scott nor any other Negro 
could be a citizen under the Constitution. The decision helped trigger the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the countdown to the 21st Century begins, the state that spawned such 
wise and folksy thinkers as Mark Twain and Harry S. Truman is again asserting 
itself as a key player in determining what may be some of the most divisive 
issues since slavery. 
</P>
<P>
Webster -- who some folks call "The General," and others "our whiz kid" -- says 
he has become a gatekeeper of historical currents as the result of "an amazing 
confluence of events . . . " His job is to defend the laws of his state, 
whether he likes them or not, he asserts. And he bristles at being seen as a 
symbol for any cause. 
</P>
<P>
But Webster's critics say that like it or not, The General is irrevocably 
linked to an image of godlike arrogance concerning the government's role in 
decisions of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
"His name means one thing to millions of people all over the country -- it 
means a violation of women's rights," said Mary Bryant, director of public 
affairs for Planned Parenthood of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, several thousand people -- 10,000 by pro-choice estimates -- 
gathered near Webster's Jefferson City office and sang "Bye-bye Billy." One 
speaker told the group: "There's only one woman in this entire state who wants 
Bill Webster in her bedroom, and that's Mrs. Webster." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a hero and I'm an enemy," Webster acknowledged with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
To understand a person, it's often necessary to know something about his 
father. To find out about William L. Webster's dad, one need only step out of 
the big brick Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City and walk across 
the street to the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff City," as locals call the town, is exactly what a U.S. state capital is 
supposed to look like. Its fringes may be fraying into strips of McDonald's and 
Pizza Huts. But its core looks essentially the way it must have before this 
"border state" splintered into Union and Confederate factions in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitol -- a Romanesque, high-domed building of gray marble overlooking the 
Missouri River -- radiates an aura of statesmanship. Thomas Jefferson stands 
watch on the steps and Thomas Harte Benton's social realist murals decorate the 
soaring interior. 
</P>
<P>
A thin man, raw-boned and mildly disheveled, with his graying hair swept back 
in a classic country lawyer wave, Sen. Richard M. Webster is quick to spin 
folksy tales about his state's political workings. But the casual demeanor is 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Webster has been a Missouri lawmaker for more than 40 years, serving 
three terms in the House and now completing his fifth in the Senate. Although 
the senator never fulfilled his dreams of becoming attorney general or 
governor, local pundits call him the most powerful man in Missouri politics. 
</P>
<P>
"He is seen as very ruthless and cunning," said former Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods, 
adding that "those terms are both used in very respectful ways in the political 
field." 
</P>
<P>
Lately though, Sen. Webster's son has begun to eclipse him in the spotlight. 
His son, he said, has nine ancestors who served in Missouri's House of 
Representatives. "It's kind of a genetic thing." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Webster grew up in Carthage, where he is considered the second most 
famous native son -- after television naturalist Marlin Perkins, whom the town 
has honored with a statue. 
</P>
<P>
Carthage is Jefferson City writ small. Clean, quiet, safe and friendly, the 
town of 12,000 is everything New York and Los Angeles are not. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Carthage in the '60s, young Webster said he never knew of a drug 
problem. He never even heard rumors of anyone having an abortion, which was 
illegal in Missouri. "It was just a much more innocent time than today -- which 
is not to say people didn't get pregnant, not to say abortions didn't take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Each summer, when Mark Twain Elementary School, and later Carthage High, let 
out, "Billy" accompanied his father to the capital, sleeping on a cot in a 
motel room Richard Webster shared with another senator. By day, he worked as a 
senate page; each night, he listened as a bipartisan cast of lawmakers met to 
talk politics and strategy in his father's motel room. 
</P>
<P>
Back at Carthage High, the boy pushed hard in other directions. His class of 
250 elected him vice president, "Most Likely to Succeed" and prom king. He 
became editor of the yearbook and newspaper, photographer for sporting events 
and landed the lead in several student plays. He also became a top debater, 
earning a scholarship to the University of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at 16, he had begun working 40 hours a week at the local radio 
station, as everything from sportscaster to disc jockey. After graduating from 
high school in 1971, he set up an entrepreneurial radio network; 18 stations 
aired his coverage of the 1972 Republican and Democratic National Conventions, 
including, Webster said, the first interview with old family friend and 
surprise Democratic vice-presidential nominee Thomas F. Eagleton. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Webster had intended to go into journalism; on a whim, he chose law 
school. General Webster graduated with a journalism degree, then earned his law 
degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, William Webster was elected to the Missouri General Assembly, where he 
was voted one of two outstanding new members in his first term; in his second 
term, his colleagues named him an outstanding lawmaker. Now in his second term 
as attorney general, Webster may well be on the way to fulfilling his father's 
political ambitions: until recently, he was considered something of a shoo-in 
for governor in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever Webster picked up from his father's GOP-style politicking was 
transformed by the irresistible media forces that shaped the consciousness of 
baby boomers everywhere. He may have absorbed Richard Nixon's credo as a boy 
but it was John F. Kennedy's style that sunk in. 
</P>
<P>
On a wall behind Sen. Webster's desk hang two photographs, circa late 1960s. 
Both show an intent young William Webster, sporting hair reminiscent of Donny 
Osmond in his mod phase. On the wall of The General's own large, wood-paneled 
office in the Supreme Court building, photos show him as a tall, crisply 
groomed, downright presidential-looking figure in the company of conservative 
icons Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has 107 attorneys on his staff, a third of whom he has appointed, more 
than half of them women. He said he never questions those who work with him 
about their political beliefs -- one of his appointees was a George McGovern 
campus recruiter. But an aura of Young Republicanism permeates the place, where 
The General often can be found tinkering with the new Macintosh and IBM 
hardware that he has championed and that now fills desks throughout the office. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Monday morning chief counsel's meeting, key attorneys gathered to 
discuss the week's agenda. As it happened, one of them -- a Webster boyhood 
friend whose father was a state representative -- was celebrating his 36th 
birthday; the group wolfed down birthday cake, chasing it with Diet Sprites and 
Diet Cokes. Seated at the head of the table in the conference room, Webster set 
a wry, jocular tone for the talk, which bounced from deep legalities, to 
college basketball, to the politics of rural Missouri courts and even to an 
execution pending that night. 
</P>
<P>
Openly competitive and hungry for important cases, Webster and his staff 
crisscross the state by plane, train and automobile, touching down at their 
four regional offices and in whichever rural courthouse their growing caseloads 
land them. 
</P>
<P>
The first U. S. Supreme Court case to draw big-time publicity for The General 
and his staff was Wilkins vs. Missouri, in which the justices decided that 
executing criminals who were age 16 when they committed a crime did not 
necessarily constitute cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Webster did not argue the case himself; his office, he said, had little choice 
but to defend state court decisions. His personal views on the case, and 
capital punishment, in general, trace to issues of where the U. S. Constitution 
and states' rights intersect and to issues of personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said he knows little about Wilkins' upbringing. But if it was less than 
perfect, he said, "it doesn't give him a license to go into a liquor store 
after plotting a murder and slit a woman's throat, watch her beg, and then 
watch her bleed to death." 
</P>
<P>
The High Court's decision in Wilkins, coupled with a decision allowing the 
execution of mentally retarded murderers, triggered a national outcry from 
capital-punishment opponents and civil libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Missouri, Webster's office tends to receive more day-to-day attention 
for the less sweeping cases it pursues; in 1988, Ad Week magazine named him 
"one of the 10 most feared attorneys general" because of the consumer 
protection lawsuits filed by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, have suggested that his office itself needs lessons about 
truth in advertising. The St. Louis Post Dispatch and Kansas City Times both 
failed to endorse Webster in the 1988 election because of issues raised by 
opponents. The Kansas City Times chided Webster for his unwillingness to join 
other attorneys general in taking on the insurance industry; the paper also 
chastised him for a suspect settlement with a nursing home that had contributed 
to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Webster writes off the criticisms as "sour grapes." His actions were based on 
sound legal judgments, as recent court decisions show, he said: "What we are 
doing here is an exciting, stimulating, significant sort of law. . . . My 
record as attorney general suggests we have a progressive, some might call it 
Populist office -- that we're interested in many of the same things (California 
Atty. Gen.) John Van de Kamp has been involved in." 
</P>
<P>
But his detractors say that The General -- named an "Outstanding Young 
American" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce -- offers Missourians more 
sizzle than steak, too many slick press releases for too little real legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little consumer investigation starts out with a huge press conference, 
yet most of them result in suits that generally have very little benefit to the 
public," said Frank Susman, the St. Louis attorney who argued against Webster 
in the Reproductive Health Services case. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wolff, a St. Louis University law professor who challenged Webster in 
the 1988 attorney-general race, paints his adversary as a political automaton, 
eager to have his name associated with landmark cases, even those, like the 
Cruzan case, that he had relegated to assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"Every decision that he makes is to further his political career," Wolff said. 
"Sometimes that is consistent with the best interests of the state and 
sometimes that's not." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, critics say, is that the two most publicized cases with which 
Webster has associated himself seem to have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in his office, he kicks his shoes up on his desk and clasps his hands 
behind his head. "People think that the cases you take are your essence, if you 
will," he said, the trace of Andy of Mayberry in his voice giving his words a 
folksy spin. What they don't understand, he said, is that he took an oath to 
defend Missouri's laws, regardless of his personal views. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, Webster believes that life begins at conception and that Roe vs. 
Wade was flawed -- that there is no fundamental right to abortion. He believes 
that abortion is essentially a moral decision best determined by individual 
states -- the key issue of the landmark case bearing his name, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Cruzan case, his own feelings and the decision he had to defend did 
not mesh well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzan tragedy began with a 1983 automobile wreck that left 25-year-old 
Nancy Cruzan in what doctors have termed "a persistent vegetative state." 
</P>
<P>
For four years, her parents attended to their hospitalized daughter. For four 
years, they saw no sign she was conscious and received no encouragement she 
would recover. In October, 1987, a Jasper County Circuit Court judge ruled that 
her parents had the right to order a hospital to remove a food and water tube 
that had maintained their daughter's limited existence. 
</P>
<P>
The General appealed that decision; the state Supreme Court overturned the 
lower court. Arguing that her family and not the state should decide their 
daughter's fate, the Cruzans took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Webster says he believed in the Cruzan family's good 
intentions; he sympathized with their heartbreaking dilemma. At issue, however, 
was whether constitutional guarantees of freedom and privacy entitle a family 
to remove food and water from someone whose own wishes were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be some kind of safeguard," he said, "so that someone can't 
snuff Grandma when there's no one there to speak for her." 
</P>
<P>
Webster himself has a "living will," detailing how he wants to be treated 
should he meet a fate similar to Nancy Cruzan's. But he will not discuss it and 
said its "provisions are personal, between me and my wife and family." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Cruzan case arrived at the Supreme Court, however, Webster was 
working with state legislators to create a process to decide when it was 
appropriate to withdraw life supports, including food and water. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10, he announced the bill at a press conference in Jefferson City, then 
flew in a state plane with staff to press conferences in Joplin and 
Springfield, where Webster exuded the self-assurance of a crackerjack 
collegiate debater. 
</P>
<P>
To his left, sat Sen. Dennis Smith, who introduced the legislation. To his 
right, sat the father of the comatose Nancy Cruzan. Eyes flooding with tears, 
Joseph Cruzan gazed into the swarm of television cameras and said he supports 
the bill, which may finally end his family's soul-wrenching ordeal and help 
other Missouri families. 
</P>
<P>
But like most life and death matters, the proposed bill has stirred 
controversy, as well as emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Critics see it as a cynical nod to a growing public sentiment against the 
government making decisions for families, while Missouri's strong right-to-life 
movement thinks Webster has betrayed their cause. "We were disappointed that 
General Webster proposed and is supporting that legislation," said Carol 
Scoville, chairwoman of the antiabortion Missouri Citizens for Life. "We feel 
strongly that all human life should be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Even more problematic for Webster is the landmark Webster vs. Reproductive 
Health Services decision, which pro-choice forces have vowed to turn into the 
most important issue of the 1992 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
That complex case was summarized by Webster in a press release: "We think 
states should be allowed to determine the point at which unborn children are 
entitled to the protections of state law." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Webster case clearly gave it the opportunity, the Supreme Court 
did not go so far as to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, giving women 
the right to abortion. The court did decide that Missouri constitutionally may 
restrict public employees from performing nontherapeutic abortions and that the 
state can require physicians to perform fetal viability tests. 
</P>
<P>
After the June 3 decision, The General's office issued a press release 
headlined "Webster Calls Supreme Court Abortion Decision 'Great Victory.' " 
Antiabortion forces cheered. 
</P>
<P>
But previously ineffective pro-choice activists used the decision as a rallying 
point and quickly gathered themselves into a powerful political force. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, of Planned Parenthood, and others believe Webster was stunned by the 
reaction to the Supreme Court decision and has tried to distance himself from 
the case since. "He's trying to stop like a cat on slick linoleum," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, however, replied: "If I wanted to be a cautious, milquetoast type of 
politician, I'd never take on anything controversial . . . If people want to 
call that political courage or stupidity, that's their option." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, contrary to his critics' impressions, "I'm not driven by an obsession 
to hold another office . . . " he said. "I grew up in a house where public 
service was given very high priority. There are lots of people who have made 
incredible contributions and are unsung. That's a noble thing." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, three committees, including one called Fund for Missouri's Future, 
have raised $733,298 for Webster. Most observers believe the money is earmarked 
for the 1992 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Webster seemed content just to sit at the left of Missouri 
Gov. John D. Ashcroft as he delivered his State of the State address. 
</P>
<P>
The governor began his conservative, law-and-order, antiabortion talk by 
lauding Missourians for being on the cutting edge of change. Quoting Thomas 
Paine, he said: "We have it within our own power to begin the world over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Webster applauded politely.

BARBARA STANWYCK DIES; CAREER SPANNED 60 YEARS

<P>
Barbara Stanwyck, whose talent, blue eyes and pulsating voice made her a 
dominant presence during 60 years of stage, screen and television appearances, 
died Saturday of heart failure. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Stanwyck, whose career spanned the chorus line, vaudeville, movies, 
television and won her three Emmys and an honorary Oscar, had been admitted to 
St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She died shortly before 5 p.m.," said Larry Kleno, Miss Stanwyck's longtime 
press agent. "It was congestive heart failure." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities attending Saturday night's Golden Globe awards were quick to praise 
Miss Stanwyck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the passing of a great lady of the screen," actress Angela Lansbury said. 
"I was very sorry to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
As a performer in 88 films, Miss Stanwyck emerged as one of the screen's strong 
independent women. Like Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and other 
major stars from Hollywood's so-called Golden Years, she had her own distinct 
style. The Barbara Stanwyck persona on films was often the femme fatale or the 
"good bad girl," able to project simultaneously toughness and warmth, cynicism 
and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
She was nominated four times for an Academy Award -- for roles in "Stella 
Dallas," "Double Indemnity," "Ball of Fire" and "Sorry, Wrong Number," and 
received an honorary Oscar in 1982 for her acting achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Born Ruby Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, Barbara Stanwyck was an orphan 
who said she never knew her parents. The task of raising her fell to an 
unmarried sister, a chorus girl who boarded her with a series of families while 
she traveled with roadhouse musicals. 
</P>
<P>
From early childhood, Miss Stanwyck wanted to become a dancer. She quit school 
at 13 to wrap packages in a Brooklyn store and taught herself to dance. Just 
after her 15th birthday, she got her first performing job -- hanging from the 
ceiling as part of a living chandelier in a Ziegfeld Follies number. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, in 1923, she became a chorus girl in a New York musical review. 
After dancing in lots of chorus lines in lots of shows, she tried out for a 
part in a production put together by Willard Mack, a top producer and director 
of the day. This was to transform her from dancer to actress, the kind of break 
all would-be stars usually can only dream about. 
</P>
<P>
Mack had a part for a chorus girl in his new play, "The Noose," but the job was 
only available in the play's out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia. For its 
Broadway run, the part had already been cast. 
</P>
<P>
After this, "destiny stepped in," Miss Stanwyck later said. The play was about 
a man condemned to death who loved a society woman and cared nothing for the 
little chorus girl who loved him. But the original third act, where the society 
woman pleaded with the warden for the body of the condemned man so she could 
bury him, didn't go over with the out-of-town audience. "So the play was 
rewritten to give the scene to the chorus girl," Miss Stanwyck recalled. "That 
meant I had to carry the third act." 
</P>
<P>
Mack started rehearsing with her day and night. "He saw something in me," Miss 
Stanwyck said in an interview years later. "I was a dancer, not a great one, 
but I knew left from right. But I was no actress. . . . He taught me how to 
walk, taught me nuances, taught me tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Mack also changed her name. Declaring Ruby Stevens was no name for a star, he 
scanned names on several playbills hanging nearby and came up with Barbara 
Stanwyck. 
</P>
<P>
When the play returned from Philadelphia in 1925, Miss Stanwyck not only 
replaced the girl who was to have the part in New York, but the now 
long-forgotten play proved a hit and ran on Broadway for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of that and other theatrical successes, she made her screen 
debut in a silent film, "Broadway Nights," shot in New York in 1927, and went 
back to Broadway in 1928. The same year, she married vaudevillian Frank Fay, 
and then followed him to Hollywood where he had signed a screen contract. There 
they adopted a son, Anthony Dion Fay. 
</P>
<P>
While Mack established her on stage, it was director Frank Capra who provided 
her shot to movie stardom. This happened after her first two Hollywood films, 
"The Locked Door" and "Mexicali Rose," both in 1929, bombed, and her movie 
career seemed headed for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But Capra signed her for "Ladies of Leisure," reportedly without a screen test. 
She played an artist's model of easy virtue who unintentionally falls in love 
with a wealthy young artist. 
</P>
<P>
Capra, she later said, taught her about using her eyes. "These are the greatest 
tools in film," she said in an interview, pointing at them: "It's nice to say 
very good dialogue, if you can get it. But great movie acting . . . watch the 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
She gave herself credit for her throaty voice: "I had it from the beginning, 
God save me!" Film historian James Harvey once described it as suggestive of 
"not whiskey or disillusionment or sexual provocation as much as . . . the 
quite unsentimental sound of tears." 
</P>
<P>
Her walk, which was distinctive for its authoritative, unhesitant stride, she 
credited to producer David Belasco and a certain animal at the zoo. Belasco, 
she said, once remarked that women do not know how to walk, and advised if she 
wanted to learn she should "go to the zoo. Watch animals walk." She took his 
advice, and said she copied the panther's stride. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies of Leisure" was followed by four other Capra-directed films, and she 
became a favorite of such major directors as Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder, King 
Vidor and John Ford. Cecil B. DeMille wrote in his autobiography: "I have never 
worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a 
better workman." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her career, she was known as a disciplined, hard-working actress who 
came to the set with every detail of her characterization in place. Wilder once 
claimed Miss Stanwyck not only knew every line of her own dialogue but all the 
other actors' dialogue too. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1930s she was solidly entrenched as one of Hollywood's leading 
ladies, and became identified with roles portraying the tough, independent, 
hard-as-nails dame. One of these, the 1937 "Stella Dallas," won her her first 
nomination for an Academy Award, playing an uneducated but ambitious woman who 
gives up contact with the one person she loves -- her daughter -- so that the 
young woman could have social position and a "good" life. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1940s she reached a career peak with films such as "The Lady Eve," 
"Meet John Doe" and "Double Indemnity." The latter, a 1944 film co-starring 
Fred MacMurray, brought her particular acclaim as a woman scheming to kill her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1944, Miss Stanwyck's name headed an Internal Revenue Service list of 
the highest-salaried women in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to film biographers, her career faltered in the 1950s. Although she 
acted in more than 20 films during that decade -- several of them Westerns -- 
critics considered many of them second-rate. But her career rebounded on 
television in the 1960s, when she played the stern matriarch of the Barkley 
clan in the series "The Big Valley" from 1965 to 1969. She also starred in the 
1983 miniseries "The Thorn Birds" and appeared for one season (1985-86) as 
Constance Colby in "The Colbys," the prime-time melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
She married twice. She divorced Fay in 1935 and married actor Robert Taylor in 
1939. She starred with Taylor in "His Brother's Wife" and "This Is My Affair," 
in 1936 and 1937, and in "Night Walker" in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hollywood's best-known couples, she and Taylor divorced in 1952. An 
intensely private person, Miss Stanwyck rarely discussed this publicly. But in 
one interview, after talking about the difficulty of sustaining two careers in 
one marriage, she suddenly said: "Bob was bored. It took me a long time to 
accept that. To understand it. He said he wanted to be a married bachelor. . . 
. The pain followed. But it comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
When she was honored with the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award 
in 1987, a reporter asked if she was satisfied with what she had accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not . . . satisfaction exactly," she answered. "Let's say I did what I 
was supposed to do. I did my work."

THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF BEBE MILLER; 
</P>
<P>
WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONTEXT, THE BESSIE AWARD-WINNING CHOREOGRAPHER TAKES AN 
UNUSUAL DEPARTURE FROM FORM IN HER LATEST WORK

<P>
No one has ever accused Bebe Miller of making dances that are too clear. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time Bessie Award-winner, Miller is drawn to the colorful ambiguities of 
psychology, and her dances have typically sketched the clarity (or confusion) 
of her inner life rather than addressing themselves to any distinct narratives. 
</P>
<P>
But now Miller, who danced with the neo-Tharpian Nina Weiner for six years 
before diving into the radically minimalist work of choreographer Dana Reitz 
for a year, seems to be cautiously edging her way towards greater social 
consciousness in her work. Context -- social and political -- is becoming 
increasingly important to her. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's company appears at Royce Hall, UCLA, Friday and Saturday -- her second 
local engagement in two years. The company also returns to San Diego on Feb. 2 
and 3, performing in the Educational Cultural Complex, sponsored by Sushi 
Gallery. Among the pieces scheduled: "Rain," a solo that recently surprised 
audiences in New York with what seemed obvious symbolism -- colors that added 
up to nothing less than the African liberation flag (red, black, green). 
</P>
<P>
A lithe, black women with layers of dreadlocks, Miller wore a gown of crimson 
velvet and danced on a large patch of farm-fresh green sod. To anyone who had 
followed the choreographer's recent work, it seemed an unusual departure. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the 39-year-old Miller, a native New Yorker who went to college in 
Indiana and then to Ohio State for her graduate dance degree, claims she was 
unaware of the symbolism until she first performed the piece. "The red and 
green were quite conscious color decisions," she says, "but the red, green and 
black? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't till I had done it a few times that I realized it. I was dealing 
with textures more than colors: The opulence of velvet -- so rich, so 
imperialistic -- versus the depth and necessity of earth, soil, grass. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't dissociate myself from a Third World point of view, because it's me. 
But the piece is much more than just a Marcus Garvey piece -- although, 
interestingly enough, I am making a Marcus Garvey wall-hanging as we speak. 
While there is some of that in there, it's limiting because 
</P>
<P>
the piece is really about this particular black woman's return to earth. 
</P>
<P>
"And not just this particular woman. I mean, I was thinking about the globe as 
a whole more than about me finding my roots. It's more of a prayer or a shout 
for more people than me to say, 'C'mon folks, roll in the grass!' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead of showing couples engaged in physical metaphors of hand-to-hand combat 
as in "The Hell Dances," Miller has recently started making dances that show 
the inner workings of different social interactions, as in her new group work 
"Allies," in which Nikki Castro, one of the six dancers in the piece, appears 
to have been given unique power over the rest -- who then scatter away like 
greased marbles. 
</P>
<P>
"After 'The Hell Dances,' I thought we would kill each other," Miller says with 
an exhausted sigh. "Emotionally, there was a 
</P>
<P>
sense that we were co-existing in a way that I couldn't see anything brighter 
happening. And maybe nothing brighter does happen. It may have been a 
dead-end." 
</P>
<P>
I felt, 'OK: We have man and we have woman, and they don't get along. But we do 
get along; I think we figured it out. And that's part of what 'Allies' is 
about. The world does continue. For some reason it seems there are more subtle 
reasons why we get along than why we really fight. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's really elusive. It's survival but it's different than the sense of 
surviving over your opponent. Why are they opponents at all? After all, we do 
take walks in the park together." 
</P>
<P>
With "Allies" (which she calls her glasnost piece), Miller feels she has 
finally found a way to expand the mechanics of her psychology out to the world. 
"Allies" is a real "turf piece," she says. "It's like looking at an active 
social mechanism from a number of different sides. . . . Everyone realizes that 
the continuity of a group depends on its inner balance, maybe even a reliance 
on each other, even though it's not necessarily a comfortable place. If 'The 
Hell Dances' were about a sense of antagonism and drama, there's a sense in 
'Allies' of the greater good and the continuing of the social whole." 
</P>
<P>
However, for all the changes in Miller's choreography, she still hesitates to 
leap into a world of direct symbolism. "Rain" came about, she says, "because I 
realized that all the intellectual exertion of 'Allies' wasn't the answer I 
thought it would be. It was a surface, front-brained approach. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sequence of events from 'The Hell Dances,' where we see the other, 
to 'Allies,' where we can see a plurality of others, to 'Rain,' which sort of 
goes back underground and says forget all that stuff: The answer is that there 
is an unknown that we can tap into. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Rain' isn't only a black piece. So many choreographers prefer for their work 
to be referred to as black dance done by black choreographers about black 
subjects. And, although that wasn't the case for me for a long time, it's sort 
of changing now because people keep asking me about it, so a point is already 
being made. But in recognition of that point, my work can be used to expand on 
the genre and expand the reactions to it. 
</P>
<P>
"What's implied is going back to self. You're not left with the fact of 
blackness but the fact of me. And I think that has to do with where I'm going, 
and I might be going there because of my blackness and my femaleness. But it's 
a place everybody can go to."

THE THRILL OF CREATION, OUT ON THEATER'S EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN STEPPLING IS HAPPY PRODUCING GOOD, HONEST THEATER WHETHER HE HAS A HIT OR 
NOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Listen to people filing out of a production of a John Steppling play, talking 
about what they thought of it, and you'll usually hear comments reaching for a 
point, and not quite getting there. "Those people were pretty wasted." "It was 
a short play, but it was long too." "Sad, but it was funny, you know?" And 
then: "I felt like I was watching ghosts onstage." 
</P>
<P>
Some hear the sound of ghosts in his plays, which suggests dramas with 
reverberation, with a past and a present. These listeners, a growing number, 
think that John Steppling just may be the purest, finest poet of the stage that 
Los Angeles has produced in this generation. 
</P>
<P>
But with the tradition-breaking form of his work -- an uncommon fusion of 
cinematic short scenes, language in which silence counts as much as the words, 
absurdist as well as contemplative moods -- some audiences feel out on a limb. 
(A perfectly fine place for them to be, in Steppling's opinion.) Impatient with 
this newness, they attach the catch-all term wasted losers to Steppling's 
characters -- like the ex-surfer in "The Shaper" or the broken-hearted dog 
breeder in "Standard of the Breed." 
</P>
<P>
That may continue with his new play, "The Thrill," opening Tuesday at Taper, 
Too, the Mark Taper Forum's smaller theater. 
</P>
<P>
Steppling, as he does on many subjects, views the dilemma in two ways. First, 
"I don't look at them as losers. That's a cruel label." Then he says that, 
since he can't control the way people think of his work, he won't worry about 
it. Quoting his mentor, Murray Mednick, playwright and founder of the Padua 
Hills Playwrights' Workshop/Festival, Steppling says: "It's about the work. 
Everything else is extra." 
</P>
<P>
One essential extra: It's also about being seen. He has worked -- constantly 
and at enormous volume (19 plays to date) -- for the past 11 years on the 
fringes of L.A. theater, where new theater is born, even if the theater houses 
there don't survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Close" (1983) was at the Factory Place Theatre. "The Shaper" (1984) was on the 
Night House stage, then moved to the Met Theatre. "Children of Herakles" (1987) 
showed at the Boyd Street Theatre. Not even the ghosts of these plays can be 
heard in those theaters now; they are all defunct. Even Padua, where Steppling 
learned theater and continues to teach workshops and write plays, appeared not 
long for this world until last year, when it revitalized itself at its new Cal 
State Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
"A precarious existence" is how Steppling described the past decade during a 
series of interviews. He is neither "successful" nor "unsuccessful" as measured 
by awards or box office, but he is a surviving stalwart committed to a life in 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Steppling, at 38, looks like a man who takes care of himself, and if he's 
standing next to his two dogs -- Chez, a hulking English mastiff, and Blackie, 
a bulldog -- he'll erase any notion of the artist-as-wimp. But scratch a 
well-built man, and you'll find a sickly child underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hit with all the childhood diseases," he recalled, "and not just once. I 
had measles six times. I stayed in the hospital a year, recovering from blood 
poisoning that happened after a gall bladder operation, which I had to have 
after an accident. I was puny in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
"But my dad, whom I loved greatly, was so fearful of the world that I got an 
attitude about weakness, that I wasn't going to be like him. I grew pretty big 
in high school, but I was still a withdrawn loner." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers how his parents' house would be always open to his father Carl's 
pals in the movie business. "They were mostly single or divorced, bitter, 
disappointed, angry guys, usually out of work, living in crappy single 
apartments around us in Hollywood. I learned how to crack jokes from them, but 
what I heard most of all was a defeatism that said, 'Don't even bother, kid, 
because life sucks.' 
</P>
<P>
"All of them had come to California. It was a place where you got stranded." 
Steppling characters are often emigres to the Golden State. They might arrive 
on the scene after hitching a ride on a Hormel meat truck. They come from 
places like Rochester, N.Y., or Las Cruces, N.M., or, as with Nat Pink and 
partner-in-hustling, Walter, in "The Thrill," Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad and these guys crop up in my plays because I was so affected by them," 
he explains. "I was around them all the time. I love the West because it's 
still big and open and a frontier. But history gets plowed under here. That, 
and my upbringing gave me this sense of exile." 
</P>
<P>
The closest Steppling came to a theater education was a sense of bloodline -- 
Carl was an actor, and his grandfather, John Steppling, had acted in D.W. 
Griffith's silent films. Carl read Shakespeare to him. Steppling took one 
theater course at Hollywood High, "but I can't remember what it was about. The 
only schoolwork I ever cared about was a report I wrote on Beckett's novel, 
'Watt.' " 
</P>
<P>
He left home at 16, playing hooky from school and spending more and more time 
reading. "My roommate and I decided to read 'The Great Books' series (a 
multivolume compendium of Western literature) for our classical education. My 
lower-class mentality yearned for credibility." 
</P>
<P>
But a shock came when he arrived in New York after a European sojourn at the 
end of the '60s. "A pal of mine handed me Louis Ferdinand Celine's 'Journey to 
the End of the Night' and William Burroughs' 'The Job' and 'Naked Lunch.' They 
weren't what I was used to. They showed me that art could be dangerous. They 
refused to go mainstream. That attracted me." 
</P>
<P>
It was like walking from the respected neighborhood of upright literary 
citizens into a crime zone of artistic outlaws, the same kind of discovery he 
had experienced with his original ambition, music. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked at my piano skills like crazy for years, and at about 17, when I 
first heard jazz from (John) Coltrane and Miles (Davis) and Thelonius Monk, I 
started listening differently." 
</P>
<P>
Then in New York, in 1970, a turning point: "My cousin told me about Theatre 
Genesis, where Sam Shepard's 'Mad Dog Blues' was on. In about a minute of 
stepping through the door, I met many of the people who have subsequently 
deeply mattered in my life. Kathleen Cramer, Mednick, Bob and Nina Glaudini, 
Shepard, Tina Preston -- most of the core that started Padua eight years 
later." 
</P>
<P>
Genesis was the coolest of the cool, counterculture theater underground, which 
also survived the '60s and retained a continuity through Shepard's own work and 
Padua. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't turn Steppling into a playwright. "No, I was writing poetry, 
reading Jean Genet, Henry Miller, the Spanish surrealists such as (Federico 
Garcia) Lorca, and started using heroin. I spent much of the '70s in a 
narcotized haze." Life wasn't going well: after "beating a rap" for armed 
robbery, he ended up caretaking at a Silver Lake school where Bob Glaudini 
taught in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob told Murray that I was writing, and Murray just asked me to write a play 
for the first Padua festival. It was called 'Science Fiction,' of which, I 
pray, no copies exist. We were one big family, mostly staying at Murray's and 
Kathleen (Cramer's) house." 
</P>
<P>
Steppling says that he had no idea how to write a play or how to direct, which 
he had to do "because no one wanted to direct my plays. But you pick up a lot 
of things. Sam (Shepard) had this goofy play the first year, 'Red Woman,' which 
Bob performed. I saw what kind of control Sam exercised, getting the work done 
and up on its feet in time for the festival, and not trying to get it perfect." 
</P>
<P>
With that imperfection comes criticism, which he says he's always eager to 
hear. Still, there is the occasional sore spot. One is the knock that a school 
of Steppling wanna-bes has emerged, young playwrights so enamored with his 
writer's voice that they have imitated him. He has voiced concern about it in 
the past, but Kelly Stuart, a playwright friend and member of Heliogabalus, the 
theater group Steppling and Glaudini founded in 1987, feels the charge is 
exaggerated. "There was some of that a few years ago," she says, "but writers 
around him are now doing work -- some flamboyant, verbose stuff -- that's very 
unlike him." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Jon Robin Baitz (a former Steppling student) recalls when, after a 
performance of "Close," he asked Steppling if he wasn't in some way ridiculing 
the burned-out people in that play. "I was skeptical that he felt any 
compassion for these people," says Baitz. "He said that he didn't want to 
discuss what he felt were my conventional notions of compassion, that he was 
perfectly satisfied with his capacity for compassion." 
</P>
<P>
("Compassion is an important quality for me," Steppling explains. "It's just 
that failure is a more interesting playwriting subject than success.") 
</P>
<P>
He won't come out and say it, but a writer's strength of will is likely what 
helped Steppling escape heroin for methadone, and then, more recently, escape 
methadone. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still addicted, only it was legal. Traveling was tough, since there 
aren't a lot of methadone clinics. When I took 'The Shaper' to Louisville (home 
of the Actors' Theatre of Louisville's Humana Festival), I had to take long 
trips several times a week to Lexington (Kentucky) for my dose. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew intuitively that if I didn't quit before I was out of my 30s, I never 
would. The decision was definite for me, but part of me worried if I could keep 
writing without the dosage. The drugs did open up parts of my mind and 
unconscious, which are critical to my writing process." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, his process is holding firm. Like a man who wants to spread the good 
news he's received, Steppling will hand you the card of a Venice-based 
herbalist whose work -- along with exercise and meditation regimens -- he 
claims detoxified him. 
</P>
<P>
"When John gets into something," says Stuart, "he gets into it all the way. He 
started bringing these weird herb teas to our rehearsals and workshops -- stuff 
like Essence of Ghekko and Essence of Deer Antler. One English mastiff isn't 
enough; if he had the room to breed mastiffs, he would. That same drive maybe 
explains why he's produced so many plays." 
</P>
<P>
At times, it seems nothing will get between Steppling and what he wants. In 
fact, he was so determined that actor Tim Streeter play "The Thrill's" Nat Pink 
that, when Streeter couldn't make the trip, Steppling drove to Portland, Ore., 
picked him up and drove back in time for the start of rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thrill" is set in a Northridge shopping mall, where several people -- not 
all of them wasted losers by any means -- cross paths in strange, predatory 
patterns. They suggest, as in many Steppling plays, the bottled-up sexual 
tension at the heart of the work of renegade psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, whose 
teachings Steppling is currently studying with a private group. 
</P>
<P>
Steppling began writing the play because he wanted to write a part for his 
wife, Diane Defoe, who plays the central role of Linda, and, as he is wont to 
do, left town -- this time for a Santa Fe motel room -- to start it. "We did a 
reading at the Taper. Only (Taper associate artistic director) Robert Egan was 
interested, and he asked me to bring it to the Taper's New Works festival which 
he runs. I rewrote it again. In between, I did 'Standard of the Breed' and 
'Teenage Wedding' for Heliogabalus, and 'Theory of Miracles' for Padua. So 'The 
Thrill' isn't a new play, even with the latest re-writing for Taper, Too. It 
contains new and old parts of me." 
</P>
<P>
Egan and Steppling are co-directing the new/old play, just as they did the 
author's "The Dream Coast" at Taper, Too in 1986. In rehearsal, they alternate 
with each other as they give notes to the cast; while Egan can be specific, 
Steppling refers to a single sheet on which he has jotted sparse notes, but 
which can trigger lengthy comments. Egan observes that "one of the challenges 
of John's writing is that his scenes start midway into action or conversation." 
</P>
<P>
The term Steppling has coined for the actors to pour on the emotion during 
rehearsal is "duck sauce." He loves cracking ultra off-color jokes to loosen up 
the company, but he doesn't hesitate to chide: "A long pause is fine; an 
eternal pause is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe even more than Chinese herbs, education is an obsession with Steppling, 
though he dismisses any autodidact label. The Heliogabalus group came into 
being when many of the Padua artists wanted to continue work beyond Padua's few 
summer weeks of activity. (The group's name, that of one of the last demented 
Roman emperors, was picked at random by Steppling and Glaudini from a book on 
Antonin Artaud.) 
</P>
<P>
It's also been a kind of extension of Steppling's own workshops: study of 
non-theater texts, from Freud to Nietzsche to the Bible, is as important as 
putting on a new play. "It's one way," Glaudini explains, "of seeing ourselves 
in terms of world theater, and reminding ourselves of the ideas that first 
excited us about theater." 
</P>
<P>
Another idea that links his workshops and Heliogabalus is, in Steppling's 
words, "the importance for the artist to embrace failure." 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas are political, and Steppling encourages study of Marx and theorists 
like Herbert Marcuse and Theodore Adorno. This, despite the fact that his plays 
never come across as overtly political. "My experience and reading end up in 
the atmosphere of whatever play I'm working on, and a lot of it has to do with 
surviving in a society which is sick and oppressed. My characters talk about 
their jobs or lack of them because having a job is what surviving in this 
country is about." 
</P>
<P>
In line with his view that "Beckett is more revolutionary than Brecht," he 
claims not to think about politics when writing. "To the contrary, I try to let 
magic take over. I wouldn't begin to explain what it's like when that happens." 
</P>
<P>
Steppling's way of keeping the magic going is a kind of act of resistence 
against temptations. Chief among them is the big money of movies. He does 
film-script rewrites, scripts-for-hire (like the Elmore Leonard adaptation, "52 
Pick-Up"), even the occasional original script (such as the unproduced Barbet 
Schroeder project, "In the Life"). Most of them are just jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the money from them also serves as a buffer against the playwright's common 
demon, the hunger for a hit. And even though Padua students like Baitz and 
David Henry Hwang ("M Butterfly") have had their hits and mainstage productions 
in regional and Broadway theater, and Steppling has not, he claims not to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected success as an artist. I don't know where I am in the American 
theater, and the people who run the theaters probably aren't sure either." Then 
he adds disarmingly, "the pressure to have a hit isn't inside me, because I 
honestly don't think I'll ever have one."
